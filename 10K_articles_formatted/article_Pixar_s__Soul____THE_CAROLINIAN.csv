On November  Pixar released their official teaser trailer for Soul an upcoming animated feature PERIOD Following their first release of  Onward set for March   Soul is the first Pixar film to feature an AfricanAmerican protagonist PERIOD Jamie Foxx voices the lead Joe Gardner a music teacher whose true passion is to be a fulltime jazz musician. after booking a gig that is sure to boaster his career Joe suffers an accident where his soul is separated from his body PERIOD He is then transported to what we can assume is a purgatory of sorts where the plot then takes off PERIOD Other actors in the cast include Daveed Diggs Phylicia Rashad Tina Fey and Questlove PERIOD

The trailer received both positive and negative comments yet it generated a consensus of general interest with the look and feel the film seems to have PERIOD The trailer opens with a variation of AJRs Overture and features landscapes and sections of New York City which are absolutely beautiful PERIOD The first half of the trailer had a lot of viewers thinking that this film would follow in the vein of Onward in that this will be a blunt departure from the typical Pixar formula by being set in reality and featuring a predominantly black cast PERIOD However once the twist was revealed viewers then began to call it InsideOut . the designs of the souls that weve seen look similar in essence to the main characters of InsideOut. another point that has viewers concerned is the fact that the AfricanAmerican protagonist is transformed into something else and may stay that way the majority of the film a trend that is seen every now and again with current animated moviesPrincess and the Frog and the upcoming  Century Fox film Spies in Disguise were the main comparisons made. though this teaser revealed a great deal of information we have yet to see the full trailer which may either confirm or deny our assumptions PERIOD Despite the criticisms lets hope that Soul does subvert our expectations PERIOD

Soul is codirected by Academy Award winner Pete Doctor and Kemp Powers and is slated to premiere June   PERIOD
