Michigan wrestlings Jelani Embree battled Illinois Zac Braunagel for control in the 184pound match PERIOD

Down  in the match Braunagel went low grabbed Embrees legs and slammed him onto the mat to take the lead  PERIOD Braunagel finished Embree with a second thunderous takedown to end the match and clinch the meet for the No PERIOD  Illini  overall  Big Ten giving them a  win over No PERIOD  Michigan   on Sunday afternoon PERIOD

Ill say it wasnt our best performance Michigan coach Sean Bormet said PERIOD We lost some close matches PERIOD Had some attacks that didnt finish cleanly quickly PERIOD We had a couple matches in the middle get away from us with some bonus points. the Illini got off to a quick start winning the first three matches PERIOD Travis Piotrowski had an early takedown in the 133pound match against the Wolverines redshirt senior Austin Assad PERIOD But Assad fought back before losing  PERIOD In the 141pound match Dylan Duncan swept freshman Cole Mattin  to extend Illinois to  PERIOD Michigan responded in the 149pound match with redshirt junior Kanen Storr gaining a bonus point to cut the lead to  PERIOD Redshirt freshman Will Lewan followed that up with another win over Eric Barone to cut the Illini lead to two PERIOD

Id say Kanen Storr wrestled pretty well offensively and on his feet Bormet said PERIOD But he needs to find ways to take guys to their back off his takedowns thats something hes working on PERIOD He had some missed opportunities there PERIOD But I think Kanen wrestled really well on his feet. junior Reece Hughes missed several early opportunities for takedowns in the 165pound match PERIOD Danny Braunagel took advantage with two late takedowns and extended the Illinois lead with a bonus point to  PERIOD Joey Gunther added another bonus point with a  major decision before Zac Braunagel clinched the win PERIOD

Guys did some good things in really almost every match Bormet said PERIOD Overall I thought we wrestled pretty hard PERIOD Just in some critical moments we just didnt get as tough as we needed to on some finishes we didnt get as tough as we needed to on some defenses. redshirt senior Jackson Striggow won his match with a single leg takedown and sophomore Mason Parris dominated with four takedowns to add consolation victories for the Wolverines PERIOD

In the end it was too little too late for Michigan and Bormet believes there were several missed chances in the match PERIOD

Were going to continue to work on the things weve been working on which is finishing our leg attacks defending our legs and mat returns Bormet said PERIOD Those would be the three things were going to continue to work on PERIOD They were three areas that cost us some matches today PERIOD

Every one of these guys had opportunities to score more we left a lot of points on the match and it cost us a couple matches. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
