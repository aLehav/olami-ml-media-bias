One day Valarie comes to school and finds Nick acting strangely excited PERIOD That day he brings a gun to school and kills some of the people on the hate list PERIOD Valarie is shot while saving Jessica and then watches Nick shoot himself PERIOD Five months later Valerie returns to school and is forced to deal with the aftermath PERIOD Everyone believes she was involved and helped Nick so when she goes back she is shunned by everyone PERIOD People who had friends killed or injured in the shooting are terrified of Valarie PERIOD
In this novel the reader experiences the aftermath with Valarie forced to relive flashes back to her and Nicks relationship experiencing his kindness as it turns into the evil that shot up their high school PERIOD
While this topic is very touchy Brown does a great job explaining the outcome of an experience like this and how people close to the shooter have to deal with their choices PERIOD
Valarie loses her friends from before the shooting while gaining some unexpected new ones PERIOD She becomes close to people she hated before while becoming a better version of herself PERIOD She helps with a memorial for the people who were killed in the shooting and does what she can for those around her PERIOD When a girl tries to commit suicide Valarie realizes that others are dealing with Nicks actions and she is not alone PERIOD This realization gives her the motivation to make the best of what she is given PERIOD
Valaries therapist and art teacher help her get through the changes in her life after such a mortifying event PERIOD They also help her cope with her fathers affair her mother waiting for Valerie to snap and her brother who blames everything on her PERIOD She has a hard time trusting both of them but when she does her attitude changes for the better PERIOD
The topic of the book can put some people off and hit nerves but it is a great book and opens the readers eyes to what these characters go through PERIOD It does not justify Nicks actions or say that people should feel bad for those who do things like this PERIOD Brown shows the struggle Valarie has with this PERIOD This is a hard realization for Valarie to come to but once she does her life turns around PERIOD She goes from the shooters shunned girlfriend to the person who helps the victims even as a victim herself PERIOD
If this book is given a chance whoever reads it will not regret it PERIOD The way it is written is as if the reader is there with Valarie and roots for her to come out of this situation shining PERIOD This book is a  out of  PERIOD
