3264,2023-11-04,"as seniors Mac Wheeler and captain John Pothast stepped off the pitch for the last time at Valley Fields Thursday night they received standing ovations from parents and fans alike as Marquettedefeated DePaul on the final night of the season  PERIOD

For Marquette head coach Louis Bennett it has been a season of ups and downs but the one thing that stayed constant was Pothast and Wheelers commitment to winning PERIOD

I think these two are champions Bennett said PERIOD Theyve got a championship ring but its very hard to win championships PERIOD Its a lot harder to play like a champion and have a heart of a champion when things dont always go your way and those two have been fantastic this season PERIOD Without them I dont know if wed win the game tonight. the final match of the season for the Golden Eagles was a backandforth affair and though Marquette had nothing to play for they still came out determined to see their seniors off with a victory PERIOD

Luka Prpa netted the only goal of the game as he scored his tenth goal of the season in the twenty-third minute off of a penalty kick PERIOD Prpa has had the knack for scoring all season long and Bennett said Prpa should be rewarded PERIOD

I think hes the best freshman in the BIG EAST Bennett said PERIOD We knew he would make an impact but we were not sure how he would acclimate to the college game and I think that he has acclimated very well PERIOD We play a certain way that really helps Luka and Luka helps the way that we play. its really great to have local boys do exceptionally well at Marquette and it helps firm up the fact that we look all over the country but we look in our own backyard first. in the second half DePaul grabbed possession and created more opportunities than the Golden Eagles but the backline anchored by Pothast held the redhot Blue Demon counterattack offense in check as DePaul tallied nine shots compared to Marquettes  PERIOD

Both seniors played key parts in the victory as Wheeler made crucial matchwinning saves minutes after each other PERIOD First in the seventy-first minute Simon Megally who leads DePaul in assists and goals dribbled down the end line and slotted a through ball to Philipp Koenigstein whospun and shot from just outside the sixyardbox PERIOD In the seventy-fifth minute another DePaul shot caused Wheeler to make a diving save PERIOD The redshirt senior had five saves in his final appearance with Marquette PERIOD Wheeler was pleased with his performance but knew that other players are just beginning their college soccer journey PERIOD

Stick with it Wheeler said PERIOD Stay the course dont get frustrated if things dont go your way PERIOD There are still ways to contribute and you can keep growing as a leader and as a soccer player and hopefully when your time comes around you can get a few young guns to help get it together and win a championship. the Marquette soccer team is very youngand Bennett pointed out the potential in the team PERIOD Three freshmen played every minute and played in significant positions PERIOD Bennett also pointed out the expectations of sophomores and juniors who will continue to help the team grow PERIOD

This team doesnt give up Bennett said PERIOD We are exciting to watch too PERIOD When you come down here to the Valley you get value for money thats for sure. at the beginning of the season the Marquette manager knew his team could so easily put up four goals and just as easily give up four goals but for Bennett he took that to heart and embraced the young team PERIOD

Im really proud and I am really happy Bennett said PERIOD We showed a lot of heart and a lot of character throughout this season and even though we may lose they can see that we are going to give a couple pints of blood every game. we have to realize that what weve proven today is irrespective of what may or may not be on the line PERIOD If you put on a Marquette shirt youre expected to play like John Pothast and Mac Wheeler. the student news site of Marquette University
