Budget cuts and a declining number of parttime faculty members have forced university officials to cut a larger number of psychology classes for the spring semester making it harder on students to register PERIOD

Dean of Social Sciences Joseph F PERIOD Sheley said the . million cut in funds for the university over the last two years is taking a toll in his department PERIOD

Its just a lot tighter Sheley said PERIOD The department is serving roughly the same number of students as they did last spring even though there are fewer courses. but seniors planning to graduate this spring such as Cyndi Warner are having a harder time getting in the required courses PERIOD

I am outraged at the registry process Warner said in an email to the State Hornet PERIOD In my department alone a total of  classes were cancelled this semester. as a result of the cancelled classes Warner said she might have to postpone her graduation date PERIOD

Most departments will work with students who get caught this way Sheley said PERIOD They will try very hard to find substitute classes to make it work out PERIOD

Warner said even though she has tried through academic advising and her counselor to resolve her difficulties she still wont be able to graduate this spring PERIOD

Sheley said along with budget cuts many parttime faculty members have left the university for other jobs that they view as more secure in the face of the budget cuts PERIOD The department has also had a number of faculty members retire PERIOD

Larry Glasmire director of special programs and enrollment said although cuts have hurt all departments every effort has been made not to cancel classes PERIOD

Nobody did this in a cavalier way Sheley said PERIOD You serve the students in the best manner that you can. your donation will support the student journalists of Sacramento State University PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
