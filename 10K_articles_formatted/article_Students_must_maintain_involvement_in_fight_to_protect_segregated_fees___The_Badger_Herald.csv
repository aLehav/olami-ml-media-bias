Last year the Wisconsin State Assembly considered adding a segment to the budget that would allow students to opt out of some segregated fees they pay to the school PERIOD

Across the country segregated fees used for a variety of reasons depending on the university fund for student organizations healthcare services sports bus passes and anything else students receive which isnot included in their tuition PERIOD They are crucial to the standing of every university PERIOD While a controversial subject when it comes to the amount of segregated fees necessary the main sentimentof the fees embodiesthe phrase by students for students with every service you receive PERIOD

This past weekend more than  UW System Student Representative school leaders met in Madison to talk over leadership development ideas and future goals PERIOD

Amongdecisions involving creationofan inclusion director and history lessons about universities in Wisconsin a major discussion point centered on thenext step regardingsegregated fees PERIOD With the State Assembly considering eliminating allocable segregated fees  meaning short term controlled by student governments  the pressure mountedto decide which fees should stayallocable and which should become nonallocable PERIOD Major changes include transit systems parking and child care all previously funded by allocable segregated fees atsome UW campuses which have now lost that status PERIOD

The main issue isnt quite what goes into which category PERIOD Its a largeand important decision but the bigger concern is still the idea that segregated fees might be eliminated PERIOD The Wisconsin State Assembly is still discussing the budget and while the statusmay look safe at the time the question very well could pop up again PERIOD Because of this the fight should continueto ensure representatives and senators hear their constituents and act on behalf of their students PERIOD

Because this issue is a state issue organizations like UWSystem Student Representatives  which connectall UW school leaders and allow them to talk collaborate and share ideas  areessential incarrying ourmessage of protecting segregated fees PERIOD Student leaders can discuss strategies get help focus on certain issues andsee that UW System studentsareon the same page PERIOD

Statewide efforts are hard to organize but witha group of more than  college campuses full ofdriven and motivated students coming together at UWSystem Student Representative meetings fighting for our rights can be made easy PERIOD

Get informed on the issue reach out to your legislator and come to the next student representative meeting to make sure your voice is heard in these issues PERIOD
