Entering its matchup against Michigan State the Michigan womens soccer team was not only looking for its first win in the series since  but it was also searching for its first score against its instate foe in roughly three years PERIOD

The Wolverines  Big Ten  overall will have to wait another year to try to snap both droughts as they were shut out once again  by the Spartans PERIOD

Theyre a good team all around said Michigan coach Greg Ryan PERIOD Theyre a solid defensive team but I dont think they were really worried about defending us because they knew that we didnt have our personnel in place and rightly so PERIOD I give them a lot of credit for having a very aggressive game plan. playing shorthanded Michigan wasnt able to absorb the pressure applied by Michigan State  Big Ten  overall PERIOD Already without junior midfielder Holly Hein and sophomore forward Meghan Toohey for the remainder of the season the Wolverines were also without their leading scorer sophomore forward Nkem Ezuirke PERIOD

Ezurike was forced to sit out this contest after receiving her fifth yellow card of the season against Northwestern PERIOD NCAA rules state that if a player receives her fifth yellow card of the season she must sit out the following game PERIOD

Her physical presence was sorely missed  Michigans offensive attack floundered all game against the Spartan defense PERIOD

It completely changes our team Ryan said PERIOD We just didnt have that target player who could hold that ball up for us today PERIOD It was a very very difficult game PERIOD

Were also still trying to figure how to adjust to Tooheys loss because she was such a dynamic force in our midfield and not having both those players on the field made it very difficult for us today. without its usual level of confidence Michigan played passively and defensiveminded for the majority of the game PERIOD The Spartans outshot the Wolverines  in the first half and they held a  advantage in corner kicks PERIOD

But despite the lopsided statistics the Wolverines did initially shut down Michigan States offense PERIOD The two teams played to a scoreless draw entering halftime PERIOD

The second half was a different story PERIOD Taking advantage of Michigans lack of offense the Spartans kept attacking and found the back of the net in the seventy-first minute PERIOD Off a corner kick multiple Spartans got a head on the ball before it fell in front of substitute midfielder Megan Marsack who fired the ball past redshirt junior goalie Haley Kopmeyer PERIOD

I think they had a corner kick advantage of  Ryan said PERIOD If youre giving up eight corner kicks eventually something is going to fall. marsacks goal snapped a drought of  of scoreless soccer played between the teams dating back to their  tie in  PERIOD

Six minutes later forward Laura Heyboer added an insurance goal for Michigan State as she tallied her sixteenth goal of the season taking advantage of a Wolverine miscue on the back line PERIOD

We just didnt have a sense of direction without Ezurike out there on the field Ryan said PERIOD
