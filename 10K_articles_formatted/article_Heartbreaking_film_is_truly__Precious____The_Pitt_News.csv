You know its an odd film season when MoNique will be a serious contender for an Academy Award and Mariah Carey delivers a performance strong enough to make audiences forget Glitter. then again Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire isnt a typical movie in any way PERIOD

Creeping into last years Sundance Film Festival to win the three major prizes the simple yet heartwrenching tale of an illiterate obese black teenager  who is pregnant with her second child from her drugaddict father  is mostly deserving of all the praise it has garnered thus far PERIOD

Claireece Precious Jones Gabby Sidibe story is certainly a dark one subjecting audiences to hyperrealistic depictions of rape abuse and the despair they create PERIOD Precious mother MoNique despises her daughter and the audience despises her for it PERIOD Its a performance so radically out of left field for the comedian that it will be a pleasure watching her scoop up supporting actress awards in the coming months PERIOD

Sidibe turns Precious into a mutedly beautiful character  the film often shifts from reality to daydream only to jolt the viewer straight back to Precious story with emotionally harrowing scenes PERIOD Carey is surprisingly good as a social worker and Paula Patton is the teacher who initiates change in Precious life PERIOD

Not a lot happens throughout the course of the film and its hard to pinpoint what exactly makes the films conclusion so affecting PERIOD The script prefers to highlight the moments of silence in between the dialogue where the actresses facial expressions offer more than ordinary words ever could PERIOD

There are odd elements  such as the random insertion of lesbianism  and the ending is in true indie fashion extremely unsatisfying PERIOD But these are only small detriments to a wonderful film PERIOD

Movies this precious dont come along very often and its a blessing when they do PERIOD
