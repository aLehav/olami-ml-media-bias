7917,2021-03-13,"the national championship win for the Crimson Tide brought a close to a bittersweet day for members of the Million Dollar Band PERIOD A member of the color guard 20yearold Stephanie Cartagena lost her battle to brain cancer in the early hours of Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

Maddie Roman a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering and her fellow teammates were informed after news of Cartagenas condition reached staff members PERIOD

The night before the national championship we got called to a team meeting and they didnt tell us what it was about Roman said PERIOD We were really nervous because it was  at night the night before the championship PERIOD We went down to the lobby area of the hotel and the instructors told us about her situation how she wasnt doing well and might not make it through the night PERIOD There were a lot of tears that night. cartagena was diagnosed early in December  after experiencing painful headaches PERIOD Having been ill earlier in the semester she visited the Student Health Center for help focused on getting better to continue performing on the field and in the upcoming championship game PERIOD

Initially she went to the health center and got a scan PERIOD They had sent her straight to UAB Hospital and the following Tuesday she had a surgery said Aimee Gueret a senior majoring in political science English and journalism PERIOD After finals I drove over to go see her and the first thing she had asked me while still under anesthesia and not all there Do I still have a spot on winterguard Her main concern throughout the whole process was getting back to color guard. the diagnosis of the disease did not hold Cartagena back from continuing to be a part of the color guard PERIOD As chemotherapy treatments continued and she was unable to perform in field shows she continued to try and stay in shape for the day she would be able to return to a performance spot PERIOD

She was well enough to come to practices but she wasnt really able to practice with us Roman said PERIOD She did what she could and when she couldnt she would run laps to make sure to keep in shape. after being diagnosed a GoFundMe page was established to help with the familys expenses for treatments and a member of the team designed Tshirts sporting the words Think Grey to raise funds and show support for their teammate PERIOD

Cartagenas positive attitude toward her illness and the strength she displayed earned her the nickname Wonder Woman among friends and family PERIOD

Throughout her entire recovery and journey she would never complain about having a brain tumor she would always complain about not being able to do guard Gueret said PERIOD It was very hard for someone to feel bad for her because she didnt feel bad for herself. the Million Dollar Band and the University of Georgia Redcoat Marching Band showed solidarity for Cartagenas family by wearing grey ribbons on their uniforms to the championship game PERIOD Color guard members had dedicated their shows to Cartagena all season in solidarity for their teammate but that final performance at the national championship carried a different meaning than their previous shows had that season PERIOD

We would all circle up before performances and say Do it for Stephanie because she would want to be here so bad Gueret said PERIOD At the national championship the dynamic changed from something sad to something positive because we knew she was there with us in spirit and watching over us PERIOD We kept saying she had the best seat in the house and what a great first game for her in heaven. donations for the Cartagena family can be sent through the GoFundMe page here PERIOD",Color guard members “Think Grey” during national championship performance – The Crimson White,University of Alabama
