The Hofstra womens lacrosse team saw their tournament hopes officially come to an end with a deflating loss to the Elon Phoenix Sunday  PERIOD

The Pride trailed by just two goals at halftime but their offense would be shut out in the final thirty minutes to mathematically eliminate them from the CAA Tournament PERIOD A dejected head coach Shannon Smith lamented the loss coming on Senior Day for a key set of four players PERIOD

This is really hard to swallow because youve got four seniors in that locker room that have made it to a conference tournament for the first three years of their career and were sitting here and their seasons could be over said Smith PERIOD Theyve given everything to this program. momentum seemed to have shifted Hofstras way when Carlee Ancona notched the final goal of the first half to bring the Elon advantage down to  PERIOD But Hofstra only got off five shots in the second half turned the ball over six times and allowed five unanswered scores PERIOD

The first half was a bit of a reversal of the seconds theme with the offense responding again and again but the defense couldnt back things up PERIOD

Alexis Greene started the game in goal but only lasted  minutes before being pulled PERIOD She surrendered seven goals while only making two saves PERIOD Maddie Fields played efficiently the rest of the way making six saves and allowing five goals PERIOD

Elon made its first mark on the board one minute into the game on a speedy rush from Shelby Scanlin PERIOD Hofstra though responded right back with a Drew Shapiro strike  seconds later followed by a Tiana Parrella score both of which were assisted by Morgan Knox controlling the offense PERIOD

After two Phoenix scores to regain the lead Lindsay Scott scored on an acrobatic shot parallel to the net to notch her fiftieth of the season by far leading the conference PERIOD The same pattern followed this sequence via two more Elon goals and a freeposition score by Scott making it  with  left PERIOD

Before the game Hofstras four seniors Scott Shelby Milne Lindsey Alfano and Becky Conto were honored on Senior Day their final game at James M PERIOD Shuart Stadium PERIOD
