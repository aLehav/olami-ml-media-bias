The campus community gathered virtually on November  and  for the colleges fifteenth Annual GIS Day PERIOD For two evenings geography experts throughout the nation and undergraduate students at CSI presented their research and engaged in open discussions on the intersection of Geographic Information Systems GIS and racial social and environmental justice PERIOD

GIS is proving to be useful in all spheres of study in  by serving as the backbone of datadriven decisions and policymaking PERIOD

Day 

Dr PERIOD Jeffrey Sachs Professor and Economist at Columbia Universitys Center for Sustainable Development delivered a speech on how mapping technology can address todays pressing agenda climate change reform and infectious disease management PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Sachs highlighted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals SDGs a group of  initiatives agreed upon by member states in  to address rising inequalities and environmental threats PERIOD

The idea of those SDGs the  of them is to reset the way that the world economy works and the way that each of our national economies should work  so that we not only produce economic growth but that it actually should benefit all of society not just a small rich part of society according to Dr PERIOD Sachs PERIOD

The SDGs range from eliminating poverty expanding access to healthcare prioritizing climate action and strengthening global cooperation PERIOD An early step in achieving these goals and creating a sustainable world that leaves no one behind involves the use of maps PERIOD

We now know that everything about the dynamics of an economy just as with the dynamics of a biome or ecosystem or climate system has a strong geographic dynamic and logic to it Dr PERIOD Sachs explained PERIOD We now have powerful tools to use that mapping to help guide our state of knowledge about where we stand with these goals in comparison with where we want to go. insights gathered from GIS are not only helpful in launching sustainability initiatives but also useful in addressing public health challenges PERIOD Dr PERIOD Este Geraghty Chief Medical Officer at Esri breaks down the nature of GIS I would say that GIS helps us to go beyond collecting the dots PERIOD Something by the way that health organizations are very good at and lets us connect the dots by using place and location analytics that create new insights and new information that helps to inform action. as the country grapples with the second wave of coronavirus maps are a visual representation of COVID19 cases and contact tracing patterns both of which can determine testing sites and highrisk infection zones PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Geraghty also spoke about how mapping can put forth equitable vaccine delivery and availability of health information to minorities which are crucial factors when acknowledging the history of structural racism in the U.S PERIOD health system PERIOD

Day 

Dr PERIOD Vernica N PERIOD Vlez Professor and Founding Director of the Education and Social Justice Program at Western Washington University kicked off the second evening with a presentation on Critical Race Spatial Analysis CRSA a study that illuminates education inequity and the degree of opportunities given to students via mapping technology PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Vlez recognized flaws in data sources as a grassroots organizer in her hometown of Pasadena PERIOD In identifying a hotspot of poverty located in the northwest area of Pasadena a predominantly Latinx neighborhood the data sources used attributed poverty to individuals not structural conditions she stated PERIOD

The construction of GIS maps had to be deeply attuned to the ways that data sources may inadvertently contribute to racist narratives producing maps that fail to underscore causality for the material realities like poverty that disproportionately affect black Latinx indigenous and other communities of color Dr PERIOD Vlez concluded PERIOD

Christen McNamara Watts GIS Manager at the City of Asheville shared how GIS technology is repairing acts of redlining that plagued this North Carolina city over the past century PERIOD

McNamara Watts shared an early 20thcentury map of areas in Asheville divided by their level of creditworthiness under a government agency called the Home Owners Loan Corporation PERIOD The creation of these maps put predominantly black communities in lowcreditworthy zones which often prevented African Americans from owning homes PERIOD

Although the Fair Housing Act was passed in  to stop housing discrimination At that point there had been generations of people that hadnt been given opportunities to own homes and theres no way to catch up  homeownership in the U.S PERIOD is the number  way to generate wealth and pass wealth on said McNamara Watts PERIOD

The conversation shifted to New York City when Professor of Finance and Data Analytics at CSIs Chazanoff School of Business Dr PERIOD Jonathan Peters brought awareness to social injustices taking place in local transportation infrastructure PERIOD

The new Goethals Bridge carries a heavy toll and no mass transit posing a challenge to individuals that are lowincome from traveling over the bridge for work opportunities PERIOD

Using GIS Dr PERIOD Peters also demonstrated how the Second Avenue Subway best serves an area of Manhattan where people have the shortest commute times and higher income per capita compared to other boroughs PERIOD Most NYC subway routes were designed by the early twentieth century and were not beneficial for the outer boroughs especially on Staten Island where commuters suffer from extralong travel times PERIOD

Government agencies are also largely unaware that they are responsible for enforcing federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on transportation Dr PERIOD Peters added PERIOD

Student Presentations

CSI geography majors took the floor to showcase their senior projects on racial social and housing justice in New York City using GIS PERIOD

CSIs fifteenth Annual GIS Day highlighted the pivotal role of mapping technology in establishing sustainability initiatives pinpointing community trends and bridging the gap of racial inequities PERIOD GIS is a powerful tool that continues to inform decisionmaking and policy implementation in the five boroughs and beyond PERIOD
