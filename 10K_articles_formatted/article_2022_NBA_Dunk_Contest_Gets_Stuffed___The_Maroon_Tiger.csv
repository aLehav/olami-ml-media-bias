 Overtime overtime February  





So what went wrong The dunk contest is slowly losing its uniqueness and becoming quite repetitive PERIOD Many NBA stars arent willing to participate in the contest and its affecting the event PERIOD This years contest is evidence that changes need to be made PERIOD It might be time to consider a new main event for AllStar Saturday Night PERIOD



The judges were NBA and dunk contest legends Julius Dr PERIOD J Erving Dominique Wilkins Isiah Thomas David Robinson and Clyde The Glide Drexler who judged a competitive slightly lackluster contest PERIOD



Some highlights of the event included Anthonys windmill dunk in Timberland boots with help from his father ToscanoAndersons onehanded windmill while jumping over firsttime AllStar and teammate Andrew Wiggins Greens crazy jumping ability and Toppins impressive display of innovation performing three neverbeforeseen dunks PERIOD



He is the third New York Knick to win the competition behind Kenny Sky Walker in  and Nate Robinson in   and  PERIOD",2022 NBA Dunk Contest Gets Stuffed - The Maroon Tiger,Morehouse College
