7934,2023-09-20,"the University of Alabama celebrates tradition PERIOD In many families football Saturdays and allnighters in Gorgas are passed from one generation to the next and some students know the ropes years before they enroll PERIOD However other students do not have that example of a college experience to follow or any example at all PERIOD

Firstgeneration college students Candace Cravey a sophomore majoring in management and accounting and Heather Hoke a sophomore majoring in nursing found themselves thrown into the deep end upon coming to campus in fall  PERIOD

After attending an interest meeting last fall for what is now Alabama Firsts Cravey and Hoke met with Kirk Walter assistant director at the SOURCE about what a support group for firstgeneration students might look like PERIOD

It started as a way to get firstgen students together as a way to give them a sense of community with other firstgen students Hoke said PERIOD

She said while her parents want her to do well they arent equipped to help her the way students whose parents graduated from college are PERIOD

I constantly get the Well good luck PERIOD I wish you the best she said PERIOD

Cravey said her parents tell her similar things but she doesnt want anyone to think negatively of them because of it PERIOD She said her parents support is the reason she is here PERIOD

Additionally she said the group is not meant to label firstgeneration students as secondclass citizens PERIOD

We dont want anyone to think were saying Oh youre firstgen PERIOD Were going to baby you now she said PERIOD At the same time its still scary jumping straight out into something no one you really know has ever experienced. hoke said she felt like she was thrown in with nothing and having a sense of community with other people who felt the same way was comforting for her PERIOD

You can come in and with a group of people you already have something in common with you can talk about the struggles Cravey said PERIOD You can talk about this wacky thing that happened to you. hoke said they have had trouble engaging members PERIOD They partnered with Student Support Services and the Student Advisory Board in the fall for a tailgate but were disappointed by the number of members who attended PERIOD

We have these longterm goals but its finding the shortterm goals and using them as stepping stones that were having trouble with Cravey said PERIOD

The two said they want to create a support system for firstgeneration students and others and theyre looking for people to help them build it PERIOD

At the moment its just me and Heather and theres nothing that she and I have an interest in doing that we havent already tried Cravey said PERIOD Were still in the building phase PERIOD If anybody has ideas or something that they want to bring to the table were not set in stone PERIOD You bring your idea and well do what we can to make it happen. cravey said anyone who wants to help out is welcome  firstgeneration or not PERIOD

Come one come all come anyone she said PERIOD
