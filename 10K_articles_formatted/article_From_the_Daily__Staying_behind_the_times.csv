On Friday U.S PERIOD District Judge Bernard Friedman issued a ruling that lifted Michigans  ban on samesex marriage PERIOD In less than  hours the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay on the judgment which on Tuesday was extended indefinitely by the appeals court PERIOD Filed by Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette R the stay means the government does not recognize the marriages of hundreds of couples who rushed to get married PERIOD Republican Gov PERIOD Rick Snyders ambivalence on the issue is not only discouraging but also flies in the face of a majority of Michiganders who are now in favor of samesex marriage PERIOD By denying LGBTQ citizens equal protection under the law the ban is in direct violation of Section  of the fourteenth Amendment to the U.S PERIOD Constitution and requires immediate attention and action from the judiciary PERIOD The state government should support legal marriage for LGBTQ couples PERIOD The court should also revoke the stay on Friedmans ruling PERIOD Schuettes argument that Michigan voters approved the existing ban in  completely ignores the publics current opinion as well as the fact that this decision is coming a decade later PERIOD

There is a clear mandate for the courts to strike down the ban on samesex marriage PERIOD Since the passage of the  ban the public support for samesex marriage has shifted PERIOD National support for samesex marriage is the highest in history and this cultural acceptance has been manifested in film art television and other forms of popular culture PERIOD Furthermore  percent of Michiganders support samesex marriage PERIOD The courts have historically followed the trend of public opinion in their interpretation of how the Constitution written more than  years ago is to be applied to presentday society and should continue to work within this framework to extend protection to more citizens PERIOD

After the ban was lifted last Friday more than  couples across Michigan were legally married PERIOD The fact that these couples have now been placed in legal limbo is the latest unjust decision in a long debate over an outdated constitutional amendment PERIOD Snyder affirmed that the marriages were legal at the time they occurred but that the state will not recognize them PERIOD Not affording legal recognition to these unions cheats the couples out of full legal benefits  the very reason April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse brought their case to court PERIOD Instead of intervening in DeBoer and Rowses case by filing a holding Schuette should recognize these couples in order to ensure that they have the same protections and benefits as other married citizens PERIOD

The behavior of our elected officials is neither appropriate nor representative of the collective will of Michigans citizens PERIOD Both Schuette and Snyder need to respect the majority opinion before advancing their own agendas PERIOD Snyders unwillingness to reconsider his stance on samesex marriage or call for a legislative step toward to marriage equality is disheartening to the many couples married this weekend and unfair to the people whom he serves PERIOD Snyder has claimed that he only has the power to enforce the law but continually backs legislation that makes its way through Michigans legislature PERIOD His hypocritical behavior and lack of leadership on this controversial issue during an election year is cowardly PERIOD
