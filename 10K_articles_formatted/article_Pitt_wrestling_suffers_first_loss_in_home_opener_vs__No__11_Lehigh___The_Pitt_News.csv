Lehighs lineup  consisting of seven top25 wrestlers  proved to be too much for the Panthers  as the Mountain Hawks  cruised to a lopsided  victory PERIOD

The heavyweight contest was a lowscoring affair as Pitts Ryan Solomon and Lehighs Doug Vollaro went into overtime with the score tied at one PERIOD Vollaro won the match with a takedown shortly into the overtime period PERIOD Solomon  injured on the takedown  laid on the mat as trainers attended to his left leg PERIOD

Solomon was in obvious pain as he limped off of the mat with the assistance of the trainers PERIOD Afterwards Peters diagnosed it as a knee injury saying that Solomon would miss at least the next match PERIOD

The team has a short turnaround as they head across the state to Philadelphia on Sunday Nov PERIOD  where theyll be looking to win their second consecutive Keystone Classic title PERIOD
