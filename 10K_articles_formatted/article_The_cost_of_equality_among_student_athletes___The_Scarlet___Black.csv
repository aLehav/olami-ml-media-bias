As required by Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act EADA the Athletic Department of the College released The Report on Athletic Program Participation Rates and Financial Support data to all current students via email PERIOD

According to the report Grinnell spends  dollars on mens teams and  dollars on womens PERIOD In other areas of athletics such as coaching salaries and money spent per student the numbers are closer PERIOD

The report is intended to make students aware of how the College achieves gender equality in athletics from the student athlete population to coaches and to budgets PERIOD In whole the report comes out of Title IX which states that male and female athletes must have equal access to participation recruitment scholarships and other benefits if their institution receives federal funding PERIOD Although Grinnell is on par with its peer institutions in many categories the College does poorly on recruitment PERIOD So what accounts for the large disparity in recruitment funds

Ben Cooprider assistant athletic director and assistant baseball coach offered some explanation for the differences PERIOD

One of the key reasons is due to how the College generated the report PERIOD Recruiting expenses come in two ways through the money set aside by the College for athletics and from money raised by alums and current student athletes PERIOD

In years past this has been a much closer alignment in money but this year one of the things that we polled was any designated gifts to recruiting purposes and allocated that in recruitment and not in others Cooprider said PERIOD We have a number of mens programs that have a much longer history than our womens program and thats not the fault of our womens programs. after all Cooprider pointed out the womens team have had a very successful run in the last few years as their records continue to improve PERIOD

Because of the mens teams longevity the connections established by former players and coaches are believed to run more extensively than the womens resulting in the disparity in gift money PERIOD The athletic department has begun to delineate plans to remove the disparity between funds PERIOD

We dont want to remedy it by lowering the amount of money spent by the mens teams we in fact want to raise the amount of money said Cooprider PERIOD I know it will be something that Andy Hamilton will be taking up with people in trying to supplement the womens budget because they dont have the designated gift funds readily available as some of our mens programs. cooprider believes that with a new athletic administration headed by Andy Hamilton the College as a whole will improve its Title IX record PERIOD

Hamilton is a great person to tell the story of Grinnell athletes Cooprider said PERIOD Hes an alum he taught and he coached two womens sports  basketball and tennis  so he understands the changes we need to make. since he began his new position Hamilton has met with other members of the department to address the Colleges Title IX failures PERIOD As a result the department has hired a Title IX consultant to conduct an independent review launched and gender equity task force overseen by head swimming and diving coach Erin Hurley and have started an internal department review which will lead to an external review done by representatives from the Colleges peer institutions PERIOD Hopefully the efforts will explicitly show what other areas the department needs to be improved on in time for the next review PERIOD

The College must follow one of three of Title IXs core requirements providing athletic opportunities for all genders having athletic population reflect the population makeup of the student body and complying with demonstrated needs of underrepresented athletes PERIOD In this case the underrepresented group is women PERIOD Like most institutions the College complies with Title IX through meeting demonstrated need among women athletes PERIOD However according to Andy Hamilton there are  laundry lists of standards that must be met in order to prove full compliance with the third requirement of Title IX PERIOD

Recently the athletic department has begun to poll all student athletes to determine how players feel about their time here at the College specifically if they believe the College has been fully committed to its progressive ideas to equality and of course to see if the College has met its chosen Title IX requirement PERIOD

Within the sports that we have we just want to make sure that were covering demonstrated need Hamilton said PERIOD He is confident in that the College does meet Title IX standards since coaches have not expressed dissatisfaction with their recruiting resources and students have not advocated for additional sports teams or other changes PERIOD However there is always room for improvement PERIOD

I want our coaches to recruit at their optimal levels Hamilton said PERIOD We want to get student athletes that can excel at the College. hamilton does admit that rosters across all sports regardless of gender could be increased PERIOD To get more student athletes however would entail increases in the athletic department staff PERIOD As an experiment the department has offered a postbaccalaureate position for cross country and track which has proven to be a success in getting more student athletes who are top athletes and students PERIOD

If we can make sure that our budgets are filled and do better in recruitment we could in fact have more women studentathletes Hamilton said PERIOD

For female student athletes currently here there are campus organizations that aim to foster strengthening their presence PERIOD Head womens softball coach Amanda Reckamp created the Female Athlete Leadership Series FALS in  with head womens soccer coach Kirsten Koester to encourage athletes to become confident in their leadership abilities PERIOD Both coaches were inspired to create this organization after attending a NCAAsponsored womens coaching academy PERIOD The event was created offer women a minority in the coaching world a multitude of networking professional development and other opportunities to their underrepresented group PERIOD

I kind of wanted to go a little further and offer that same opportunity to the Colleges female athletes Reckamp said PERIOD And so we started FALS PERIOD Its basically a workshop once a month bringing female athletes in to strengthen the womens athletic community to come in a shared experience of being female athletes and troubleshoot and discuss any issues that come up on our teams and kind of problem solve  how to become better leaders in real situations within those teams. once a month the members of FALS meet to discuss various topics such as leadership development and failure recovery conflict management PERIOD To be a part of FALS women athletes must be recommended by their coaches PERIOD The four years that it has been a part of the College has been a success in Reckamps opinion PERIOD The athletic department has been nothing short of supportive and this years group has expressed greater interest in solidifying FALS presence PERIOD In turn the athletes have grown confident in their leadership abilities and thus team culture surrounding the womens sports have improved substantially PERIOD

Sometimes I think that the people in that room arent sure where or how to make an impact but hopefully these sessions empower them to have a conversation to hold a teammate accountable and to know that they have the skills and abilities and to know that its okay to do those kind of things Reckamp said PERIOD

As a coach however Reckamp believes that she has not felt like the department has failed to meet her goals PERIOD

I take advantage of the lots of recruiting opportunities available Reckamp said PERIOD Some of them that are beyond my given budget line so I take advantage of several academic recruiting showcases PERIOD The administration has been nothing but supportive of me finding opportunities to recruit toplevel student athletes to come play softball here so  I dont think Ive been hindered by a budget and I dont feel like I dont have the same opportunities regardless of gender and sport to recruit toplevel athletes and students. hanna Kessel  a womens basketball and track studentathlete is one of the newest FALS members PERIOD

I expected to come out of it with a kind behind the scenes look at what leadership means not only to athletes on their teams but to coaches and what they expect of leaders on their teams Kessel said PERIOD

In light of the Colleges current Title IX violations Kessel hopes that FALS will take on a more central role in the discussions on how to solve them PERIOD

I definitely think that FALS is an important organization to work with the groups that are trying to respond to these disparities because like FALS has got representation from all the female teams on campus Kessel said PERIOD FALS can represent a collective voice that can discuss all those overarching issues that we are experiencing as an athletic department PERIOD FALS role in this process has been pretty limited and it should be increased definitely. kessel however is skeptical if anything will come out of it PERIOD As she pointed out to even begin to work on changing the dynamic between male and female athletes the students must be aware of the inequality PERIOD

When they handed out the survey one of my teammates was giving out the cards and we wondered what are we supposed to write and then she started listing off the things in which things werent equal Kessel said PERIOD Then all of us started going like wait a sec yeah thats not all that fair So its as if as in the moments when those stuff are happening you get a little ticked off but we hadnt been musing over it as a team until that moment PERIOD I cant imagine that if the womens team had to collectively get together to talk about it that the mens team do. although she trusts in Hamiltons ability to work actively to achieve gender equality within the athletic department Kessel is not sure if her efforts will actually come into fruition PERIOD Many colleges struggle to fulfill these Title IX requirements and in their efforts to do so have let down some student athletes PERIOD

Do you add another team or do you make the womens teams have more players Those are two things that are unrealistic to ask for Kessel said PERIOD There are just not a lot of sports you can add PERIOD Then theres a disproportionate members of teams so its really hard in allocating funds proportionally well PERIOD A team of  players against a team of  basketball players do not need the same amount of funding numbers wise. even current players could be affected by efforts to comply with Title IX PERIOD Cooprider and Reckamp are adamant about recruiting athletes that are not only outstanding in their sport but also can thrive in a prestigious school PERIOD

As a basketball player I dont want to have  players Kessel said PERIOD Its less playing time for me  I think its absurd that the mens basketball team has so many players But I also dont want to take those positions away from male athletes. kessel pointed out how colleges have for example been removing wrestling from varsity competition as a way to follow Title IX PERIOD

As well Kessel stressed that it partly depends on the student body to voice their dissatisfaction PERIOD One of the elements of Title IX is that colleges must meet the demonstrated demand for athletic participation PERIOD That entails working towards a womens lacrosse team for example if students advocate for it PERIOD

Throughout the year there will be opportunities to discuss this aspect of Title IX PERIOD It is important for the student body to participate in these conversations for a few reasons PERIOD Students like Kessel were only knowledgeable of the College because of recruitment PERIOD The athletic community makes up a sizeable percent of the student body population and thus contribute to the legacy of the College PERIOD Given the Colleges progressive image it will be interesting to see how the College tackles gender equity and Title IX in athletics PERIOD

I have a few comments to be made here PERIOD  One if there any other athletic programs at a college in the US period that is more keeping in line with gender equity than Grinnell tell me regardless of the real issues raised PERIOD  That is also more of a comment about all of those other schools PERIOD Two not only has Andy Hamilton coached womens sports but he also was a football and mens basketball coach PERIOD That as well as being an alum I believe provides him an almost unique perspective on athletics at Grinnell and its role PERIOD Three as for recruiting the thing about Grinnell and this has always been the case is that it has never had to rely upon incoming athletes to help buttress enrollment and thereby tuition revenue PERIOD That is one of the reasons that rosters especially in football has always been low compared to the other schools in the Midwest conference PERIOD Many of the other colleges in the Midwest Conference in the past at least have relied on athletes who are willing to show up as sources of revenue that helped keep their institutions afloat. pERIOD Monmouth College at one point in the late 1980s had only  total students but more than  players on the football team all paying customers. pERIOD Grinnell has also always had a very narrow demographic to recruit from PERIOD Students who are athletically capable of playing Division III sports have the proper grades and SAT scores have the intangibles for what Grinnell wants in a student who can thrive within the Grinnell culture and is willing to come to rural Iowa PERIOD Because Grinnell is also going against Macalester Carleton Earlham Oberlin and the likes for that same set of students PERIOD Its tough PERIOD Also lastly the student who said that Its absurd that the basketball team has so many athletes doesnt understand Dave Arsenaults system PERIOD Just saying PERIOD",The cost of equality among student athletes – The Scarlet & Black,Grinnell College
