On Monday night concert tees leather and your occasional fedorawearing fans gathered at the Save Mart Center for a night of good music PERIOD

Hipsters rejoiced this summer when it was announced that The Black Keys had added Fresno to its  world tour PERIOD

For general admission ticket holders the doors opened at  and for reserve seating entrance began at  p.m PERIOD But no matter where you were seated you had to go through the routine pat down by security

The concert promptly began at  p.m PERIOD with The Black Keys opening act Tegan and Sara PERIOD You might remember Tegan and Sara from your high school years but the sister duo managed to bring in a good number of younger fans PERIOD

The pair opened with one of its more popular songs  Walking With A Ghost. even if you were not a fan or knew who they were you could find yourself moving and bopping to their songs PERIOD

Sara lightened up the audience with jokes about having to stop drinking and smoking before the show because she didnt want to be the second Canadian of the week to vomit on stage PERIOD She was referring to Justin Bieber who vomited in the middle of his concert earlier this week PERIOD

The sisters played an hourlong set including a new track called Closer. expect to hear more from these two Canadians who said their new album will drop in the beginning of next year PERIOD

The Black Keys took the stage shortly after opening with their hit Howlin For You from the album Brothers. the stage was decked with a variety of lighting combinations for each song performance and large screens were placed on the sides for the audience who were in the back or were unlucky enough to stand behind a tall person PERIOD

Dan Auerbach lead singer and guitarist and Patrick Carney drummer are men of few words PERIOD

Auerbach said a couple of words thanking the audience but they stuck to what they were there to do play music PERIOD

Throughout the concert Auerbach and Carney did not just play songs for their newest album El Camino but serenaded the audience with old hits from their 10year career PERIOD

The Black Keys played crowd favorites including Same Old Thing Little Black Submarine  Lonely Boy and the groups first single that appeared on Billboard Top  Tighten Up. you can see the audience in the reserved seating standing as The Black Keys played while the crowd on the floor had people jumping and dancing. the floor crowd even had a few younger fans twho decided crowd surfing was a good idea PERIOD

Carney besides showing his talent of keeping his glasses on while playing showed his intense form of keeping the beat and getting into the music throughout the entire 90minute set PERIOD

After finishing the set list the band left the stage but came back out to the screaming fans for an encore that made the crowd go wild once a giant disco ball was lowered onto the stage PERIOD

With the performance of Everlasting Light Auerbach showed his unexplainable vocals that range from garage blues alternative and indie rock the genres that best describe the bands style of music PERIOD

Monday night The Black Keys showed that rule number one to sound good live is to have talent PERIOD
