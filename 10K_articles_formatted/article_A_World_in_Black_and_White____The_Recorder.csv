Remarking on the connections between racial tensions in America and criticism of President Barack Obama  CCSU history professor Katherine Harris delivered a lecture highlighting key criticism of our new President PERIOD

When she was asked to talk about this topic she immediately thought of the book Here I Stand by Paul Robeson PERIOD

I opened to this page and the quote that he mentioned is very revealing to our topic Paul Robeson wrote Here I Stand in  she explained PERIOD

This comment I couldnt let go by A century has passed since Frederick Douglas pointed out that the relation exiting between black and white people of this country is a central question of the age she went on to quote PERIOD

Paul Robeson was quoting Frederick Douglas who wrote that in the  but now we are in  and we are still dealing with that question. harris went on to ask that question PERIOD Is the issue of race a static concept that is something unchanging she asked Is race an invisible entity

Since Americans have elected an African American president some people consider that racism is not a problem anymore and that race is now invisible. and Professor Harris added Can the discussion on the topic become a source of a transformative dialogue on race trust reconciliation and humanity

She also cited bits of information from the New York Times article As Race Debate Grows Obama Steers Clear Of It. obama said that he is not the first president accused of being a communist or socialist PERIOD

Harris explained that Obama pointed out that presidents before him have been criticized in that respect PERIOD Are there people who dont like me because of my race Im sure there are Obama was quoted as saying PERIOD

The things that were said about Roosevelt were pretty similar to the things that were said about me. obama was also quoted as saying race is such a volatile issue in this society that it is difficult to determine whether it is a predominant factor in political discussions or part of the background PERIOD

Other views published in the New York Times included those of columnist Maureen Dowd who is blamed for stirring up the race debate PERIOD

Harris commented that there is also a tension between conscious and unconscious racism in the United States PERIOD She said that unconscious is obviously harder to detect and therefore harder to eradicate PERIOD

Professor Harris added that many of these events reflect the issues of race in the States PERIOD

She recalled the racially charged incident involving Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr PERIOD He was arrested at his home after a neighbor called police with suspicions that he was trying to break into the house PERIOD

He was arrested according to police for exhibiting tumultuous behavior. a reporter asked Obama what he thought about that event and the police officers specifically to which he responded they acted stupidly. when Obama arranged for he Gates and the overseeing police chief Sgt PERIOD James Crowley to meet over a beer and discuss the issue Harris was dismayed to see that critics had called the situation two  black men ganging up on Crowley. she pointed out that Vice President Biden also attended the meeting PERIOD

Race remains a factor American  society PERIOD Another example that illustrates this fact is when President Obama went to a school in Texas PERIOD It was a very innocent speech said the speaker PERIOD

But some conservative parents saw he opportunity for the president to impress young minds PERIOD It is how an innocent event Harris said becomes an incident with racial undertones PERIOD

Furthermore the subject of healthcare is very sensitive PERIOD There is a theory that says healthcare reform should be used in order to pay back the African Americans who were slaves or healthcare are retribution. the current debate on healthcare was linked to something that had nothing to do with healthcare. the lasting effect of comics and images portraying Obama negatively has done a lot of damage said Harris PERIOD

On a large screen she showed a few examples of images such as the food stamps that she pointed out are commonly associated with African Americans or people in need PERIOD

She explained that the world is  binary in a world in black and white PERIOD

Harris also said that regardless of the social and racial circumstances Obamas election is a political and a social miracle. the Recorder
