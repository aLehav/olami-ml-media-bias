My palms were sweating my ears were ringing and my pupils were dilated  my body reeled from the sensory assault PERIOD No you really should get back to studying my conscious brain told me  but I tapped the screen to retry anyway entranced PERIOD Such is the power of the new iOS iPhone iPod Touch game Super Hexagon a pure puzzle game that like Tetris before it has enough uncanny allure to keep you coming back again and again PERIOD

The gameplay of Hexagon is easily understandable after seeing someone play it inperson but rather difficult to explain with words PERIOD The player controls an arrow that moves around the perimeter of a hexagon that pulses in the middle of the screen PERIOD As a timer counts up the arrow is assaulted by all sorts of shapes and lines that come with increasing speed and complexity and the players objective is to avoid all such objects for as long as possible PERIOD

But while this concept may be easy enough to grasp it is probably the only thing the game is going to give up without making you view a game over screen several hundred times PERIOD Let us not mince words here Super Hexagon is a hard game built from the ground up to walk the fine line between adversity and frustration like its retrothrowback peers Canabalt and VVVVVV which emphasize pattern memorization and muscle memory over high production values or a sweeping narrative PERIOD

This is hardly surprising to fans of the developer  after all the onemanteam behind Hexagon Terry Cavanagh is also behind VVVVVV  but people who download the game and expect instant success are in for a rude awakening PERIOD Unless you are a god of twitch gaming  that is fastpaced titles that rely on quick reflexes and handeye coordination  you will likely last less than  seconds at your first go on the games easiest modewhich the game helpfully describes as hard. still if youre able to get past the initial difficulty shock you will find yourself slowly but surely increasing your score through simple practice PERIOD This is a rare trait and certainly one of Super Hexagons greatest strengths The game itself teaches you to play PERIOD

In each of the six modes there are only a set number of patterns shapes lines etc. the game can throw at you PERIOD Memorizing how to avoid those patterns is the key to success PERIOD

While some simple puzzle games require the player to go to external sources to learn highlevel strategies Super Hexagon requires no such guide only your time and patience are required PERIOD

While this game is definitely worth the time and money only . of anybody in search of a decent iPhone game it should also be noted that it is highly highly addictive PERIOD If you sank dozens of hours into Tetris on your flipphone back in the day be aware that Hexagon might lead to the death of your social life the loss of your significant other and a significant reduction of your GPA PERIOD

You have been warned PERIOD
