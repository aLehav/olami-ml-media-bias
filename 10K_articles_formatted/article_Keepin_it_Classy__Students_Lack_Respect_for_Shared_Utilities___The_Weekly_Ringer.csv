The University of Mary Washington Student Newspaper

By BRITTANY VITNER

I started living in Mason Hall for my third year here at the University of Mary Washington and while its not perfect the refurbished dorm is rather nice PERIOD The rooms are lit completely and lots of outlets are available PERIOD The bathrooms are big the hallways are bright and the many study rooms are pretty have plenty of chairs and couches and are large and comfortable PERIOD

One thing I really liked when I went exploring on movein day was the kitchen on the third floor PERIOD It was rather large and simple with lots of room for multiple people PERIOD Some of its amenities included a big fridge a new microwave a stove two ovens and a large garbage bin PERIOD It was clean and attractive unlike the last kitchen I had in Willard which contained an oven that was shut down early in the first semester because being so old it was dangerous for students to use PERIOD

However on the first Friday of class I went to the kitchen to reheat some leftovers for dinner and discovered that the place looked completely different PERIOD

One stove was filthy PERIOD The counter had trash and dirt all over it despite being two steps away form the open almost empty trash bin PERIOD

The microwave unleashed a blast of hot air in my face when I opened the door PERIOD It had dried sauce on its walls and pieces of popcornbag paper stuck to the glass plate PERIOD In attempting to clean the microwave I nearly burned my fingers peeling off the paper PERIOD It was the first week of class and this was the state of the newly revamped kitchen PERIOD

I wish I were not so used to students misusing the dorm and ruining things they share with others PERIOD

In the first week of my freshman year we had one of those unscheduled fire drills that Im sure many students here are familiar with PERIOD Theres the classic case of a student microwaving Easy Mac or a Ramen Noodles without water and then walking away and forgetting about it PERIOD

We had at least five more unscheduled fire drills throughout the year PERIOD About halfway through the first semester the fourth floor kitchen was locked because students did not throw trash away left dirty dishes in the sink for days and were slowly destroying the microwave PERIOD

Im also just going to throw in the word Russel and if youre anything beyond a freshman you should know what I mean PERIOD

In my second year our halls microwave became extremely filthy PERIOD It was even replaced and the RAs put up a sign on the wall behind it that included basic instructions on how to use the microwave and a request that residents respect it since the whole floor had to share it PERIOD

The kitchen also became filthier as the semester advanced PERIOD One student cooked a pasta dish in a metal pan on the stove early in the first semester and never cleaned the pan PERIOD After some time of sitting in the sink it was moved to the top of the fridge so that it was out of the way PERIOD When the second semester started an RA put the pan still unclean in a plastic bag beneath the sink next to the paper towels PERIOD It was there a week before school ended and it might still be there for all I know PERIOD

I suppose that there are some people out there who miss the RA announcements floor meetings emails and written notices that explain how you the students are responsible for cleaning your own room bathroom and kitchen PERIOD

Its one thing to know understand these problems and another to confront the fact that a significant portion of this college campus does not understand simple things like how to use a microwave or trash can PERIOD

UMW has a cleaning staff that is responsible for keeping the campus clean PERIOD They fix the lawns vacuum and wash the Nest Seacobeck The Underground and the teaching and administration buildings PERIOD

They are not responsible for specific student areas like the kitchens dorm rooms and suite bathrooms PERIOD They are not responsible for picking up trash on the ground you couldnt be bothered to pick up yourself cleaning your dirty dishes or wiping kitchen counters after you use them PERIOD

Your peers are not responsible for cleaning up your messes either PERIOD

Were in college now PERIOD I hate to break it to you but your parents arent here to pick up after you and you are sharing space with a lot of other people PERIOD

So pick up your trash clean your dishes and if youre microwaving something read the instructions PERIOD Its not difficult and youre still going to be doing it all after you graduate anyway PERIOD",Keepin it Classy: Students Lack Respect for Shared Utilities â€“ The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
