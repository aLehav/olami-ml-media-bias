Turning Point USAs booth in the  Boylston Place alley PERIOD

By Luna Theus Marcus Cocova and Keshav Vinod October  

The Emerson chapter of Turning Point USA was suspended by the college after the conservative organization passed out controversial stickers that many students saw as propagating harmful antiChinese stereotypes but they argued were political criticism PERIOD

The stickers which were used as a promotion at a tabling event in the  Boylston Place alley on Sept PERIOD  featured a character from the popular multiplayer game Among Us wearing a suit emblazoned with a hammer and sickle PERIOD Making reference to the Chinese Communist Party which controls the countrys state apparatus the figure was accompanied by the phrase China is kinda susreferencing the games jargon for determining the impostor or suspicious character among the group PERIOD

The sticker quickly sparked backlash among Emerson community members drawing accusations that Turning Point is fomenting Sinophobic discrimination which has been on the rise since the pandemic began. reports of antiAsian hate crimes nationwide increased by  percent in  and by  percent in Boston during the same time period according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University PERIOD

Last year five percent of Emersons student body identified as AsianPacific Islander students PERIOD  percent or  students identified as international students according to the colleges factbook319 of those  were from China PERIOD

The sticker targeted China and China is somewhere that we all grew up in as Chinese international students said one Chineseidentifying student who wished to remain anonymous PERIOD For Chinese people that idea of China is just so important that you automatically feel hurt PERIOD Its not even political at that point. qiuyang Chen a junior international student from China said the statement the sticker sent was inappropriate PERIOD

Americans have a political bias towards China he said PERIOD

In response to the stickers Emersons Chinese Student Association released a statement on Instagram denouncing TPUSAs actions as senseless and intolerable. we denounce all forms of racism and bigotry against Chinese individuals as well as the entire Asian community read the post published on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Emerson is supposed to be an inclusive community yet any hate speech is unacceptable and we experience tremendous pain from this incident. we are demanding an apology from TPUSA as well as appropriate disciplinary sanctions concluded the statement PERIOD

The association could not be reached for an interview PERIOD

The next day college officials sent out a slew of statements denouncing the stickers clarifying that all reports on the incident had been referred to the Office of Community Standards PERIOD

It has come to my attention that several individuals were distributing stickers yesterday that included antiChinese messaging that is inconsistent with the colleges values and will not be tolerated on our campus Interim President Bill Gilligan wrote in an email to the community PERIOD

Gilligan said that the colleges commitment to free speech could not be used to violate those community standards of inclusivity and denounced all instances of antiAsian bigotry and hate. despite the backlash from administrators and students TPUSA members maintain that the stickers were intended to comment on Chinas government and political structure not its people PERIOD

Our main point behind the sticker was to discuss China communism and the power the CCP has over the people there said K.J PERIOD Lynum a junior writing literature and publishing major who serves as TPUSAs campus coordinator PERIOD

The college promptly opened an investigation into TPUSA reviewing potential community standard violations surrounding biasrelated behavior and invasion of privacy PERIOD According to an email from Director of Community Standards Julie RothhaarSanders obtained by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education the club will be suspended from oncampus activities pending the conclusion of the review PERIOD

TPUSA President Sam Neves said that college administrators did not contact his organization before issuing their respective public statements on the matter PERIOD

Both Gilligan and Jason Meier director of student engagement and leadership declined to comment instead referring to the Sept PERIOD  email PERIOD

In an email to international students Andrea Popa director of the Office of International Student Affairs said that words used to create a hostile environment for community members are unacceptable despite the groups argument that the stickers fall under their freedom of speech PERIOD

To our Asianidentified and AsianAmerican students you have the right to be treated with respect and to feel safe on the campus you call home Popa wrote PERIOD

The stickers were not the first incident of antiAsian sentiment circulating on Emersons campus PERIOD In  antiAsian vandalism was displayed across multiple room doors in Emersons Little Building.The Student Government Association drew attention to the issue arguing it was part of a broader pattern of discrimination PERIOD

We want to acknowledge that these are not isolated instances of racism and xenophobia the statement read PERIOD Students of color and international students experience them everyday its just a matter of how blatant it is PERIOD It doesnt mean the everyday microaggressions are any less harmful. tPUSA and its members have received harsh public and private criticism in the days since the events unfolded Neves said PERIOD He claimed that the organizations members received death threats in the days following the event PERIOD

Lynum criticized Gilligans response saying he acted rashly in calling the sticker emblematic of Asian hate PERIOD

Our President was all too quick to virtue signal his view that this was Asian hate without investigating in an overeager attempt to show that he is sensitive to racial issues Lynum who is from Singapore said PERIOD

The event was quick to reignite a campus discourse on the impact of TPUSA at Emerson two years after its creation in  PERIOD Nationally the organization is known for its controversial and oftenprovocative presence on college campuses PERIOD

I was kind of surprised it was approved by SEAL just because Turning Points whole thing is to trigger liberals said Noah Schulte a junior political communications major PERIOD The college should be doing everything they can to punish these students because what they were doing was blatantly racist. alex a senior visual and media arts major whose last name was not disclosed to The Beacon said she believes TPUSA is nothing but a performative farce PERIOD

I dont really think theyre going to be changing anybodys minds she said PERIOD Its more just theatre. luna Theus SheHer currently serves as a staff writer for The Beacon PERIOD Originally from Florida Luna is a rising senior at Emerson College with minors in sociology and political science PERIOD Her passions include reading writing and everything Marvel PERIOD
