An official poster of The Flash. jOEY FRANKLINJune  

I want to start this review by saying Michael Keatons return as Batman was the best part of The Flash it was really fun to have Danny Elfmans Batman theme peppered throughout the scenes that Keaton starred in PERIOD While it is really hard to compare any Batman movie to Christopher Nolans iconic Dark Knight trilogy Batman  which Keaton starred in is one of the best Batman movies PERIOD

Personally I saw The Flash in IMAX because seeing Michael Keaton say Im Batman on the big screen was a bucket list item of mine PERIOD

OKon to The Flash. i had a rough idea of what the plot was going to be inspired by and that was the Flashpoint Paradox story that has been told in multiple iterations across comic books and animated movies PERIOD

The rough plotline of the Flashpoint Paradox story is  and there will be spoilers for The Flash movie here  Barry Allen also known as the Flash can run so fast that he can run backward in time PERIOD

After he discovers this he runs back in time to his childhood when his father was falsely imprisoned for murdering his mother PERIOD The Reverse Flash  yes that is his name  is the one who killed Allens mother and wants to make his life miserable for some reason framing his father for the murder PERIOD

Allen runs backward in time and is able to stop Reverse Flash from killing his mother resulting in his father never being imprisoned PERIOD He runs back to the present day to realize everything has changed for the worse and has to make the tough decision to let his mom be killed for the good of the future PERIOD

Surprisingly intense for a comic book right

There is an animated rendition of this movie Justice League The Flashpoint Paradox that is available on streaming services and is honestly way better than this liveaction adaptation PERIOD I would say that the animated version of the movie is worth a watch but keep in mind that it is pretty intense for an animated movie PERIOD

Back to the new movie The Flash has been mired in controversy due to the leading actor Ezra Miller being charged with several crimes and the movie has had a pretty weak box office reception PERIOD

The plot of The Flash follows the Flashpoint Paradox omitting the Reverse Flash from the film and toning down the overall intensity factor of the plot from the animated movie PERIOD

I was surprised by the main conflict of the plot PERIOD When Allen goes forward in time to see how everything turned out after he saved his mom he pops out of the Speed Force in  to discover that there are no metahumans Aquaman Cyborg etc so he has to save Superman from a super prison to stop General Zod which was the plot of the Man of Steel movie PERIOD

Sitting next to my friend at the showing of the movie he leaned over to me and said This feels like a fever dream which is the best way that I can think of to describe it PERIOD

The movie was not all bad it was an enjoyable watch for the most part but it falls into the stereotype of DC trying to do too much in a single movie and creating a muddled mess. there were a lot of plot lines and the end of the movie is a really lame copout for an ending PERIOD

Director of Guardians of the Galaxy movies James Gunn has recently departed Marvel to direct movies at DC so hopefully Gunn can right the ship that has been sinking since  PERIOD

Overall this movie was entertaining but I think I would wait for it to come out on a streaming service instead of seeing it in the theater again PERIOD
