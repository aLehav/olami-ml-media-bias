A Minneapolis developer is eyeing Dinkytown for a largescale apartment building adding to the recent ascent of student housing developments in and around the University campus PERIOD

Brett Naylor principal of the Urban Land development company plans to build an eightto10floor apartment complex on the  block of University Avenue Southeast which is currently occupied by Pizza Hut PERIOD

This building is more based on location in my viewpoint a superior location Naylor said of his apartment complex PERIOD

You walk out the front door and youre on campus you walk out the back door and youre in Dinkytown which is obviously a great place to be for a student he said PERIOD

Naylor who worked on similar projects at the University of WisconsinMadison said the apartments would offer underground parking Internet access and possibly retail space in the ground floor PERIOD

Rent would cost approximately  per bedroom he said PERIOD

It caters to students and there would be student amenities in the building but you would rent a threebedroom with one lease which differs from other large buildings such as the Melrose Apartments that require individual leases per bedroom he said PERIOD

The building that Im proposing to put up would be run just like a basic apartment building Naylor said PERIOD

The newly constructed Melrose on the Universitys eastern edge will house  tenants when fully completed in December PERIOD Half the buildings rooms will be available in August and approximately  percent of those have been booked said leasing agent Shane Meuwissen PERIOD Rent ranges from  to  per bedroom PERIOD

Each person gets their own bedroom own bathroom and share a common area Meuwissen said PERIOD The Melrose also includes a fitness center game room computer center tanning rooms and multimedia theater PERIOD

You have such a large student population you can have something for everybody Meuwissen said PERIOD

Naylor said he is trying to attract students who might shy away from more expensive buildings PERIOD

Hopefully Im catering to a market that doesnt want to pay  a person he said PERIOD Theyd rather share the bathroom and pay  a person. due to the recent growth of student housing on and off campus Mannix Clark interim director of University housing said the University does not plan to build more student housing facilities until it determines the success of recent developments PERIOD

We want to wait and see how that affects us before we build more Clark said PERIOD

Although the University has no authority over offcampus development Clark said his office monitors the housing situation PERIOD

I think we want to make sure were building what the students want he said PERIOD Our students want housing but they want affordable housing. but Naylor said the new housing projects around the University might soon reverse a longstanding trend of low vacancy rates and increased supply could lower rental costs in the area PERIOD

This market is not going to be able to support the rents that are out there right now theres just too many new buildings on line and the competitions going to be too fierce PERIOD

I think this campus is going to find at least a stabilizing in rents or rents actually dropping he said PERIOD

Naylor said he hopes construction on the apartment building will begin next summer and anticipates its opening in fall  PERIOD

If I were a student here I would probably want to live in Dinkytown Naylor said so thats why I want to develop in that area. michael Krieger covers University
