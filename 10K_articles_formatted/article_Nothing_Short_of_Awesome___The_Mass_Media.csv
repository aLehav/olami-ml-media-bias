UMB has a curious trend within its athletic department right now PERIOD The shortest players on the Beacons rosters have been coming up huge this year PERIOD

College athletic recruiting has always been about three things size size and size PERIOD If you dont have it you wont get any looks PERIOD The brigade of undersized stars at UMB are showing everyone that using that strategy might not be the best way to go PERIOD

Mens basketball coach Charlie Titus is noticing the trend PERIOD

For us last year Mike Mitchell was our best player and he was the shortest on the team Titus said

When asked about whether he takes size into account when he recruits he said If there is a  guy and a  guy with the same skill set well take the  guy PERIOD The smaller player has to be at a much higher skill level to get looked at. that could be a major reason why there is such a concentration in skill level with smaller athletes in college PERIOD Short athletes coming out of highschool have to be extremely prolific and talented to even get looked at PERIOD

Kayla Wilson a junior on the womens volleyball team plays Libero at the almighty height of  a half foot shorter than any of her teammates PERIOD While her position has been traditionally played by shorter girls Wilson is particularly short PERIOD

My position these days is being played by girls like  or taller PERIOD They can cover more court with me being  I have speed but thats about it she said PERIOD More than  of Liberos are taller than me right now but you still see some girls who are shorter than I am. when asked why she thinks shorter girls are disappearing from the game she replied I think coaches are thinking of a more reasonable height to play back row like  because they can still hit the ball to the back row and put power into it. krista Ledin at  is one of the shortest players for womens soccer but that hasnt stopped her from being one of the biggest stars this year for the Beacons PERIOD She leads the ladies with  goals and was honored with LEAC rookie of the week last week PERIOD When she was asked if she thinks opponents overlook her because of her height she said Absolutely. they look at me and underestimate my aggressiveness on the playing field PERIOD They get surprised once we start playing. i have never been affected by my height she said PERIOD Its been an advantage if anything because people underestimate me PERIOD It affects the way I play because I am able to maneuver the ball around players and beat most players to the ball. ledin is on pace for an MVP season for the Beacons and she recently won rookie of the week PERIOD

I love being short and wouldnt have it any other way she said PERIOD

Mens hockey star Travis Daniel loves his  150pound frame when hes on the ice PERIOD

I feel like being undersized gives me an advantage because I can move around bigger guys easier and I can dodge and get away from hits quicker he said PERIOD Opponents always underestimate me because of my height PERIOD Coaches have also looked past me because of my size PERIOD Ive heard a lot of short comments towards me throughout my hockey career but it never bothers me. uMB coaches have done a great job about not overlooking players because theyre undersized and theyve been rewarded with some real gems PERIOD Wilson Ledin Daniel and Han have all been huge performers in their time at UMB and they are showing that size matters is simply a clich PERIOD
