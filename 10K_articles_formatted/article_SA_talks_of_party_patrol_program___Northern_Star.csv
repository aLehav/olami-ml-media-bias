By  Tammy SholerJanuary  

One of the ways to keep NIU students living offcampus from being suspended or arrested for having loud parties at all hours of the night became one of the main topics of discussion at the Student Association Senate meeting Sunday night PERIOD

SA Tenant Union Advisor Carey Ward said one way to prevent students from being arrested is the party patrol program where students serve as a buffer to tell parties that the cops are coming. michelle Emmett associate director for University Programming said the program was initiated a few years ago by the SA after NIU started cracking down on parties PERIOD Volunteer students would go to the party and tell the host to break it up or lower the noise Emmett said PERIOD

Larry Bolles director for the University Judicial Office said he was accused of suspending a student for having a party where there was excess noise and students were urinating on the house next door PERIOD But he said I have never suspended a student for having a loud party. ward said an anonymous studentclient came to his office upset and scared because Bolles had threatened him with suspension if he had another party PERIOD The student wanted to remain anonymous because he was scared Ward said PERIOD

Bolles said he had a fathertoson talk with the student about people urinating outside and the student restrained people from urinating outside at the next party PERIOD

Bolles said NIU does not have the authority to punish offcampus students for having a loud party that is the DeKalb Polices jurisdiction PERIOD He did say however if anyone becomes intoxicated at a students party and is injured the host is liable for the accident PERIOD

Ward said there has been more than one case of students being threatened with suspension for having loud or outofhand parties PERIOD

SA President Jim Fischer said the program was dissolved because students stopped volunteering PERIOD The SA now is looking into alternative means to start up the program again such as paying students to be buffers he said PERIOD

Ward said he brought the issue of students being arrested or suspended to the SA Senates attention to receive their guidance on how to proceed because what he does directly affects the SA PERIOD He said his purpose was not to attack Bolles but to find a solution because he believes the issue can be worked out PERIOD

Bolles said NIU does not have the manpower to respond to complaints about loud parties he said PERIOD Even with all the manpower the DeKalb Police has they still do not respond for about two hours because there are numerous complaints Bolles said PERIOD Also the police return to the house two or three times before they arrest anyone he said PERIOD

Fischer said the program only would improve the relationship between NIU the police and the students who have parties PERIOD The program must receive SA Senate approval before it will be enacted he said PERIOD Specific details for the program have not been worked out yet Fischer said PERIOD

In addition DeKalb citizens are complaining about the excessive partying that goes on especially in the CollegeJohn Street area Bolles said PERIOD Locals are putting pressure on the DeKalb City Council to stop the loud parties because there have been many outofhand parties he said PERIOD
