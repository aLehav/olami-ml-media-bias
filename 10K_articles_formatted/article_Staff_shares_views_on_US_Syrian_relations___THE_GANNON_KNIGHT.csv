While most people fantasize and think about what they could do if they were president of the United States PresidentObama is probably thinking what he wouldnt do to not be the president of the country in these tough times PERIOD
One of the most recent issues on Obamas and everybody elses mind covered in every news outlet and discussed in every social gathering is the situation in Syria PERIOD
For those who know little about the subject people are dying and chemical weapons are being used PERIOD
The use of passive voice in these sentences is justified because as far as knowledge of who did what goes most people are in the dark PERIOD
Obama however in one of his addresses to the nation said he had evidence the Assad regime was responsible for the use of such weapons repeating Bushs weapons of mass destruction rhetoric offering no tangible proof on the matter PERIOD
In his speech to the nation Tuesday Obama implored the American public to support him in his decision to attack the country saying that presenting a unified front of the nation will help it accomplish its goal easier PERIOD
However the public including The GannonKnights staff remains skeptical with some not having a specific opinion on the matter PERIOD
One of the arguments discussed in the newsroom is letting countries deal with their own problems on their own especially given that the Syrian conflict falls more within the lines of a civil war PERIOD
Another argument mentioned is the possibility of having more innocent people killed in the attacks as drones and bombs cant differentiate the evil from the good PERIOD
We also suggested the U.S PERIOD was already not too popular with foreign countries and engaging in an act of war will not help change that image PERIOD
With an attack or not we wish both regions constant safety peace and stability PERIOD
