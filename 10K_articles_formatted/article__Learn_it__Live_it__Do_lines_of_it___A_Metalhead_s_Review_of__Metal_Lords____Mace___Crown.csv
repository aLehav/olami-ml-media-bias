Netflix has been releasing plenty of bingeworthy shows and captivating movies throughout  PERIOD Metal Lords is a movie centered around three teenagers and their involvement with metal music PERIOD The comedy was written by D.B PERIOD Weiss the writer and director of the Game of Thrones series PERIOD Tom Morello famously known as Rage Against the Machines guitarist was an executive music producer for the film PERIOD Both of these great minds are metalheads and are deeply fond of the music scene PERIOD Seeing the involvement of these individuals made for a promising film that hopefully wouldnt let the metal community down PERIOD

The movie follows three high school students who are all socially awkward in their own right PERIOD The story is from Kevins perspective a novice drummer who was given a double bass drum kit by his best friend Hunter to start a metal band PERIOD Hunter is a guitarist and is the main metalhead of the group PERIOD Hes deep into the scene and is always seen wearing metal merch PERIOD The last of the trio is Emily a Scottish student whos an experienced cellist and has anger issues PERIOD

The movie kicks off with Hunter and Kevin trying to practice a song written by Hunter PERIOD Kevin only a marching band drummer has no experience with a complete kit PERIOD In fact he isnt at all familiar with metal or its culture PERIOD Kevin starts practicing with a drum kit given to him by Hunter and sees Emily a girl he knew from Marching Band practice playing the cello PERIOD He sees her as a talented individual and wants her to join the band PERIOD However Hunter is against the idea of having a cellist PERIOD After Hunter finds out about a Battle of the Bands event his school is hosting he signs up for the competition PERIOD In order to prepare Kevin Hunter gives him a list of songs from iconic metal bands PERIOD This is what sends Kevin spiraling down a rabbit hole of metal culture PERIOD Kevin decides to share the same list with Emily which sends her on a path to learning about the music PERIOD The plot develops from here on out into a story about high school bonds dealing with negative emotions and struggles and how impactful music can be to an individual PERIOD

The film features a lot of great homages to metal artists and culture PERIOD Bands like FEAR Celtic Frost Iron Maiden and Meshuggah are among many bands that are referenced throughout the film PERIOD The literature and nerd culture that became a part of metal can also be found throughout the movie PERIOD Certain scenes show books like Inferno by Dante Alighieri and games like Dungeons and Dragons PERIOD The former alone inspired plenty of songs like Demons Gate by Candlemass or Charon by King Diamond PERIOD The fantasy genre itself inspired a style of metal dedicated to it known as power metal PERIOD The soundtrack carries iconic songs from bands like Black Sabbath and Metallica PERIOD Both do a great job catering to the metal audience and acknowledging its roots PERIOD It even features a whole scene with cameos from the genres icons like Rob Metal God Halford PERIOD

The film pulls no punches when it comes to making fun of behaviors and misconceptions that plague the metal community internally and externally PERIOD One such example is how its riddled with people who are pretentious about subgenres and artists in different genres PERIOD Hunter is the prime example of a tongueincheek portrayal of these folks PERIOD He has an aggressive outlook on life and prides himself on being someone who only goes against the grain PERIOD If something isnt metal to Hunter then he just doesnt like it PERIOD Hunter even goes as far as being unnecessarily nasty towards others who have different tastes or are part of the statusquo PERIOD Then theres a bassist who tries out for Hunters band that mindlessly plays notes and focuses more on the stage elements within the genre PERIOD The bassist situation serves to poke fun at the misconception that metal doesnt require any actual talent to be played PERIOD Its safe to say that the bassist didnt make the cut PERIOD

Metal Lords might not appeal to older metalheads as much as it would to younger members of the community PERIOD After all the movie is centered around a Gen Z perspective more than a Gen X or millennial perspective PERIOD The bullying and high school mannerisms are different from past times PERIOD Certain parts of the movie might be hard to watch for older folks because of its cringeinducing humor PERIOD Thats not to say that itll have the wincing effect on a younger audience but it might be more relatable PERIOD

What the movie might lack in age relatability it makes up for with the genres nostalgia PERIOD Theres a sequence where Kevin starts practicing his drums to War Pigs by Black Sabbath PERIOD The scene essentially shows how hes getting better at the drums over time but it doesnt stop there PERIOD Kevin stops dressing the way he originally used to PERIOD The colors in his wardrobe start changing he starts wearing boots then starts wearing band shirts PERIOD The music didnt just become part of his practice sessions it became a part of him PERIOD That specific scene perfectly encapsulates the process a lot of people in the metal community went through PERIOD Once it sticks itll stick for life or at least long enough to impact you as a person PERIOD Its not until youve gotten completely sucked into that culture that you realize how much its affected you PERIOD

While Kevins personal growth is spot on for a lot of metalheads its not all the film has to offer PERIOD Metal Lords shines by portraying why people become infatuated with heavy music in the first place PERIOD Its implied that metal became an outlet for Hunter ever since his mom left his family PERIOD Kevin a shy and nonconfrontational individual slowly gains confidence through his improvement in drumming skills and metal musics bringing truth to power attitude PERIOD Its also implied that Kevin doesnt really get much emotional support from his parents since theyre working around the clock PERIOD Emily has a loving family but struggles with a condition that makes her prone to angry outbursts PERIOD What everyone in the cast shares is being a sort of outcast within their highschools society PERIOD The niche culture gave Emily an opportunity to be accepted by welcoming people PERIOD Everyone goes through a transformation of character PERIOD This motley crew of misfits respects the reasons why metal became so huge in youth culture from the 80s to the present PERIOD Its composed of people whove gone through troubles in life who feel out of place and who desire to be part of something bigger than themselves PERIOD At the end of the movie everyone ends up growing into a better version of themselves PERIOD

Ultimately Metal Lords might present issues for older audiences who fell in love with the metal genre with some of its awkward humor PERIOD However the movie does as much justice as it can to the metal scene within its hour and  minute runtime PERIOD It delves into todays generation of high school culture along with the new bloods present within the metal community PERIOD It carries a vibe that is reminiscent of Jack Blacks School of Rock and Superbad PERIOD While the film isnt as impactful as these classics its a great film for a casual watch PERIOD It is ultimately charming and carries underlying themes of individuality companionship dedication and personal growth PERIOD Its worth the watch for fans of the music and for anyone looking for a couple of laughs PERIOD
