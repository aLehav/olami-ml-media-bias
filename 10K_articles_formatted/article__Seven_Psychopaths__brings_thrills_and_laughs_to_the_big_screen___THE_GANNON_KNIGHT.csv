Judging exclusively from simply seeing or hearing the title one would think that Seven Psychopaths would exhibit nothing but thrills and chills PERIOD However the movie packs more laughs in it than any other movie this year while still capturing a few thrills along the way PERIOD

The viewer only has to sit through the first five minutes to recognize that quirkiness is sure to follow in a way that would make even Quentin Tarantino jealous PERIOD

The story follows Marty Faranan Colin Farrell an underachieving screenwriter occupied with writing his screenplay Seven Psychopaths. martys friends Billy Bickle Sam Rockwell and Hans Kieslowski Christopher Walken are in a slightly more dangerous line of work PERIOD They steal dogs and receive handsome rewards when returning them to their respective owners PERIOD

They eventually run into trouble as they steal a Shih Tzu belonging to a deranged gangster Charlie Costello Woody Harrelson who is determined to get his dog back by any means necessary PERIOD As Charlie attempts to hunt down the thieves Martys crew is caught in a catandmouse game trying to avoid the gang PERIOD Throughout the story Billy and Hans try help Marty enhance his screenplay often leading to imaginative and quirky suggestions by the two PERIOD

Martys screenplay is almost like a small microcosm of whats happening in the actual movie with the movies main characters each being labeled as a particular psychopath. its a little bit unclear as to why they dont return the Shih Tzu to eliminate the risk of getting killed but it just points to the whole silliness factor that this movie exhibits PERIOD After all they are psychopaths so its probably not vital for the filmmakers to address that issue PERIOD The random eccentricity is what clearly sets it apart from other heist movies PERIOD

Speaking of screenplay this movie features a great one PERIOD If you enjoy lightningspeed dialogue then youre going to love this movie PERIOD Director Martin McDonaghs fast uptempo script flawlessly harmonizes with his witty and quirky characters PERIOD When they always find themselves in precarious situations they always deliver with comedic relief PERIOD And thats what so special about this film PERIOD It has a script that can take itself seriously at times but also possesses the ability to provide a multitude of laughs through its smart script PERIOD

McDonagh could not have picked a more perfect cast to work well with his script either PERIOD Rockwell Farrell and Walken probably exhibit the best onstage chemistry out of any movie youll see this year PERIOD McDonagh couldnt find a more perfect core PERIOD

Black comedies such as Seven Psychopaths are certainly hard to pull off PERIOD Not everybody has the delirious yet inventive mind of a Tarantino but McDonagh has managed to create possibly one of the best comedies of the year PERIOD
