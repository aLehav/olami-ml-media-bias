Why Guns N Roses needs a new album

Dave Holmes was on his way to work in New York City when a billboard caught his eye PERIOD No it wasnt one of those gigantic Calvin Klein ads that Times Square is famous for PERIOD This billboard was about to change his life PERIOD
I was temping and waiting tables at the time and one day I saw a billboard for MTV that said Open call for VJs said Holmes PERIOD  MTV was advertising for its  Wanna Be a VJ contest PERIOD
The competition was to be huge PERIOD  contestants filled Times Square crowding the streets directly below MTV Headquarters PERIOD The prize One lucky contestant would win the chance to be a VJ for the popular television station PERIOD
I was  at the time said Holmes and I thought Id come in and learn and get some experience PERIOD If I got the job terrific. holmes impressed both fans and MTV executives alike with his extensive musical knowledge and his poise in front of the cameras PERIOD Even though he was the first runnerup Holmes lost to Jesse Camp MTV was compelled to offer him a position PERIOD
It wasnt long before Holmes scored his first onair job PERIOD It was strange because I was doing a screen test and they came in and said Carson Daly is going to be out Friday do you want to fill in for him said Holmes PERIOD
At the time there was this thing on the air called MTV Live which is now Total Request Live. it was  minutes of live TV he said PERIOD I had never done anything like that before PERIOD I was scared to death PERIOD And they brought it up so casually like Do you want a sandwich
Holmes gladly accepted the offer PERIOD He calmed his nerves and psyched himself up for the task PERIOD I had faith in myself he said PERIOD Its all improv PERIOD You have to get into the zone and get it done. plus Holmes felt comfortable in MTVs laid back atmosphere PERIOD This is not CNN PERIOD You get to have fun PERIOD If you mess up its like Oh God what the hell am I supposed to say And its okay to say that PERIOD Its not like youre Peter Jennings he said with a laugh PERIOD I knew I wasnt going to burn the building down. having a strong background in theater didnt hurt either PERIOD Holmes studied psychology and theater while attending Holy Cross University in Massachusetts PERIOD Ive acted all my life he said PERIOD And I did a lot of improv in college PERIOD Id even write my own stuff. since his MTV Live debut Holmes has appeared on Total Request Live MTV  Billboards Top  Pop Songs New Years Eve Live and Spankin New Music Weekend. he most recently finished a long stint as host of MTVs Say What Karaoke. his favorite show to date has been Video Cliches. i was the head writer for that show he said PERIOD  It was cool because we got to make fun of the artists a little PERIOD That was a blast. holmes has also interviewed some major stars in the entertainment industry such as actor Tom Cruise singerdancer Britney Spears and pop group NYSNC who coincidentally debuted on MTV Live the same day as Holmes PERIOD
Theyre a really good group and its funny because when I was a finalist for Wanna Be A VJ my first time on MTV Live was the first time they were on MTV as well he said PERIOD Over the past three years I have seen them become the biggest thing in the world. holmes who grew up in St PERIOD Louis Miss. said his interest in music came from his family PERIOD I come from a musical family said the soontobe 30yearold PERIOD  My grandfather was in a barbershop quartet PERIOD My older brothers went to college in the late 70s and 80s and listened to groups like the Sex Pistols and the Clash. at age nine or  I fell in love with it he continued to say PERIOD  I never developed a talent for it but I was a fan. ill listen to anything jazz country he said PERIOD Music is a condiment to life PERIOD And you really dont have one favorite seasoning. holmes prefers a taste of everything PERIOD
What does Holmes schedule look like in the weeks to come Im currently working on a new pilot so Ill be flying out to LA for that PERIOD Then after that well be shooting more specials he said while snacking on a banana PERIOD And Spring Breaks coming up which is always really bizarre. holmes plans to make the most out of his MTV experience PERIOD He even offers some advice to college students Be practical PERIOD A lot of people think that right away theyre going to be successful PERIOD Get that out of your head PERIOD If you get a foot in the door and youre willing to learn you can go far. he did PERIOD
