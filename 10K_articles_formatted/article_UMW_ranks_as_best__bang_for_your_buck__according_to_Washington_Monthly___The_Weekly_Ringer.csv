We have historically been in the middle price range among the  public fouryearcolleges and universities in the commonwealth and we track this every year because we dontwant to become one of the more expensive schools Provost Jonathan Levin said as theUniversity of Mary Washington was ranked as the sixteenth best school in providing the best valuefor ordinary nonwealthy students out of  colleges and universities in the Southeast PERIOD

UMW offers financial aid which is available upon completion of the Free Application forFederal Student Aid FAFSA in addition to student employment opportunities PERIOD Both are offeredto students without regard to physical ability political affiliation marital status sex color racereligion age or national origin PERIOD

Our students werent getting as much as we believed they should and theCommonwealth did respond last year enabling us to award larger Virginia grants For instatestudents with financial need as determined by the FAFSA Levin said PERIOD

Scholarships are really helpful PERIOD The one big one they sent out for foundationscholarships helps because there are lots of opportunities said Lauren Sargent a sophomoreintending to do education and English PERIOD Sargent believes that UMWs financial aid services arean essential part of her ability to attend the school PERIOD

A big concern for students however is the assurance that the education they receive isworth the money they pay PERIOD As a member of the education program Sargent is able to earn bothher bachelors and masters degrees in just five years while masters programs at otheruniversities could take an additional two years or more PERIOD

The fiveyear masters program is the biggest benefit to the school Sargent said.UMW is one of more than  colleges and universities in Virginia that participates in theGuaranteed Admissions Agreement with the states community colleges PERIOD

According to Anna Billingsley associate vice president for university relations at UMWIn particular regard to transfers we continue to promote the Guaranteed Admission Agreementopportunities with the Virginia Community College System which are an excellent way forstudents to minimize costs by attending community college for two years. billingsley added that transfer students can also use community college experience toget ahead when they attend UMW PERIOD When they come to Mary Washington they are guaranteedjunior status and have most if not all general education requirements fulfilled Billingsley said.However Jennifer Hedgpeth sophomore english major has a slightly different view ofUMWs financial aid services PERIOD Hedgpeth said thatthey are not as helpful as I would like them tobe but they can be helpful if you ask the right questions. as an outofstate transfer student Hedgpeth said money was the biggest concern forher when it came to choosing which university to attend PERIOD

In Maryland her home state college is generally more expensive forcing her to look formore affordable options in other states PERIOD In Maryland I would have to pay  a year togo to a school like this PERIOD UMW was one of the few outofstate colleges that put me on par withinstate tuition Hedgpeth said PERIOD

Therefore without UMWs financial aid services the typical fouryear degree might beless attainable for many students PERIOD

For example Gyeore Lee junior studio art major said I did not receive financial aidduring freshman year and had to pay over  per semester PERIOD If I were paying that amountof money throughout every school year I would not able to finish school in four years. lee alsoexpressed a concern about the cost of living at UMW PERIOD

In my personal opinion I think that theprices of meal plans are too expensive she said PERIOD In addition to meal plans students mostlydetermine where they are going to live based on the price of the dorms or nearby offcampushousing while some students live at home and commute to the university to save money PERIOD

Despite various challenges faced in trying to afford Mary Washington most studentsagree that the price being paid is worth the time spent and experience gained here PERIOD",UMW ranks as best “bang for your buck” according to Washington Monthly – The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
