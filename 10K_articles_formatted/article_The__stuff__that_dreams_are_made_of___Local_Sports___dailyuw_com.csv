When Dwight Gooden broke into Major League Baseball in  at the age of  he wasnt just good  he was amazing right from the beginning PERIOD

The  won  games in his first season and showed the promise the Mets were hoping theyd see PERIOD He was one of those rare prospects who made a major impact while still in his teenage years PERIOD

The next season at age  he was even better PERIOD He led the majors with  wins en route to winning the National League Cy Young award  the youngest player ever to do so PERIOD

After that is where his story gets rocky and this one begins PERIOD

In  while Gooden was pitching his way to a World Series ring in New York current Mariners pitcher Felix Hernandez was born in Venezuela PERIOD

Hernandez was a wunderkind much like Gooden when he first picked up a baseball PERIOD At age  he was throwing 94mph heat and at age  he was a professional ballplayer PERIOD It is the kind of beginning to a story on which legends and hall of famers are born PERIOD

As he tore through the Mariners minor league system in the initial years of his career he was viewed as the next great Seattle pitching prospect PERIOD For a team that saw the prime of Randy Johnson Hernandez was going to be the encore PERIOD

Then as pennant races became a thing of the past and losing became the norm at Safeco Field the phenom received a new title Savior PERIOD

Last season as a secondstraight losing season was winding down Hernandez was welcomed to the show PERIOD

The hype was everywhere PERIOD Analysts throughout the media started the inevitable comparisons to Gooden PERIOD Hernandez was supposed to take the baseball world by storm and jumpstart a sad Seattle pitching staff that featured a 42yearold ace Jamie Moyer and a steroidusing No PERIOD  starter Ryan Franklin PERIOD

Ending the season with a  record and a . eRA he was impressive if not Goodenesque PERIOD Thoughts of Hernandez anchoring the rotation from then on made the  losses easier to stomach PERIOD

As this season started he was no longer regarded as the future PERIOD He had become the now PERIOD Like Gooden before him he was a star by his twentieth birthday and the expectations were looming large PERIOD

Unfortunately for Mariners fans trapped in another mediocre season he hasnt lived up to the expectations  not yet anyway PERIOD

He showed all of the promise we know he has by holding the Tampa Bay Devil Rays to just one run in . innings earlier this month only to remind us of his age seven days later when he got rocked for five runs in four innings in a loss to the Oakland As PERIOD

Watching young players learn and develop is an upanddown affair PERIOD They take their beatings and learn from them as they work towards their future PERIOD Only once in a generation does Doc Gooden come along as someone ready to rule the league in the infancy of his career PERIOD

Hernandez is bound to be good maybe even great PERIOD He has the stuff of an overpowering ace and if given time will develop into just that PERIOD

Maybe by struggling and hearing the calls for a trip down to the minors King Felix will avoid the pitfalls that derailed Goodens career before he could leave his mark as one of the greatest of all time PERIOD
