Student journalists in Mexico have taken a hard hit as a universitys unjust act of censorship violated a constitutional right freedom of speech.La Universidad de las Americas in Puebla Mexico is TCUs sister university PERIOD And its student newspaper La Catarina was gagged by university administrators and campus police Jan PERIOD  in possible retaliation for a series of controversial cartoons of Chancellor Pedro Palou PERIOD Staff members were abruptly evicted snatching personal belongings as they were ordered to leave PERIOD

Student reporter Astrid Viveros said staff members were even restricted from returning to the newsroom to back up computer files PERIOD

The administration went to the extent of cutting off the electricity in our office to prevent us from doing so she said PERIOD

Now the administration intends to call the shots and supervise La Catarinas content calling it a service project. thus the very institution that aims to educate its students is robbing them of the opportunity to learn in an independent environment which is meant to teach students to be responsible and learn from their mistakes PERIOD Also the university is stripping away the voice of the newspaper which consequently will stifle the voice of the student body PERIOD It would suffice to say that UDLA is taking a giant step backward PERIOD

While the Mexican Constitution differs from the U.S PERIOD Constitution freedom of the press remains unwavering PERIOD

According to Article  of the Constitution of Mexico Freedom of writing and publishing writings on any subject is inviolable PERIOD No law or authority may establish censorship require bonds from authors or printers or restrict the freedom of printing which shall be limited only by the respect due to private life morals and public peace. its doubtful that a couple of cartoons in a student newspaper qualify as disturbing the public peace PERIOD This vicious event is nothing more than an attempt to protect the reputation of an imageconscious chancellor PERIOD The administration should realize that a studentrun newspaper is just that PERIOD And the purpose of an editorial cartoon is to express the view of the cartoonist not the university PERIOD

Unfortunately the idea of censoring the media hits closer to home than our sister university in Mexico PERIOD Skiff staff members combat similar obstacles when attempting to complete their journalistic duties PERIOD Some university officials at TCU try to dictate the interview process or withhold information that should be public knowledge PERIOD

Informing readers of information that is rightfully theirs can be near to impossible when sources on campus are more concerned with their reputations than offering truth to the TCU community PERIOD In actuality character is measured by honesty PERIOD And only the sources who are honest with students faculty and staff are worthy of admiration PERIOD The TCU community should look to university officials who remain the models of honest educators aiding student journalists in their pursuit of the truth PERIOD

Its imperative for UDLA and TCU to realize that student journalists have the right to print the news to inform their college communities on current events from basketball scores to philanthropies to controversial scandals PERIOD The intent of a newspaper is not to present libelous content but to educate its readership PERIOD Its referred to as freedom of the press PERIOD

Sadly UDLA may never see freedom of the press on its campus again PERIOD A student newspaper under the authority of university administration is only a step away from journalistic communism PERIOD
