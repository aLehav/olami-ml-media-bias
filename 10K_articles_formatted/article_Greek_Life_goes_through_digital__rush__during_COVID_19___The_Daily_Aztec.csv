Hit or Miss Parking at San Diego State is a definite miss for students

Meet the District  supervisor candidate Amy Reichert

For the first time ever San Diego State students rushed with fraternities and sororities digitally over the past two weeks due to concerns about COVID19 PERIOD

The decision to hold the Fall semester rush was met with some mixed reviews from those within Greek life PERIOD Many participants felt like they were being robbed of their college experience however most respected the decision PERIOD

I think it wouldve been a little more fun and relaxed inperson said business junior Sean Erdman PERIOD I was on Zoom for upwards of seven hours a daybut Im glad I did it anyway. students made their way to Zoom to talk with active members and see which Greek houses fit them the best PERIOD If the interest is mutual students will receive a bid to join the Fraternity or Sorority PERIOD

Amidst a community outbreak of COVID19 at SDSUs campus with over  cases to date deciding to hold rush online instead of inperson was an easy call PERIOD Due to classes being mostly online and the spike in cases around the College Area leaving it somewhat deserted there was no possibility for Greek life to hold rush as they normally do PERIOD

Instead of going house to house students went from Zoom call to Zoom call  with some finding it harder than others to connect with the active members in a digital setting. however despite the challenges students were still able to enjoy the process PERIOD

Overall the experience was good said finance junior Armen Tumanov PERIOD It was definitely briefer  so its hard to judge what fraternity fits you the best. with physical isolation in play due to the COVID19 pandemic students are left wondering how fraternities and sororities alike will handle these unprecedented times PERIOD

After the suspension of  chapters following the death of Dylan Hernandez last year both fraternities and sororities are using this semester to rebrand their image PERIOD They want to showcase how Greek life can be a positive experience for students even with a virtual platform PERIOD

Fabiola Sarabia Roa the President of SDSUs Lambda Sigma Gamma sorority chapter said Greek life can open doors for students looking to make an impact in college PERIOD

It does have a positive impact on students she said PERIOD Many people in our organization were lost and even lonely before joining our organization PERIOD Once integrated into Greek life youre not only allowed to expand your connections but you are also able to make a positive longlasting impact on others and meet people you never thought you would meet. while highlighting the social benefits Roa also noted the importance of community service and keeping others safe PERIOD

Everything is completely online to prevent large gatherings and the possibility of people falling ill she said PERIOD We are planning on having a virtual fundraiser for our philanthropy PERIOD This means that we want to fundraise for underserved communities to help youth go to college PERIOD We are also planning on doing a scholarship this year for youth in a local high school. all in all students fraternities and sororities are adapting to this unique situation and look to make the best out of this mostly online semester  while still preserving the rich campus culture PERIOD",Greek Life goes through digital “rush” during COVID-19 – The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
