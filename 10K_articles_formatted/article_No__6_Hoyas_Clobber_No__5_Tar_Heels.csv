No PERIOD  Hoyas Clobber No PERIOD  Tar Heels
By Sean Gormley Hoya Staff Writer
The North Carolina Tar Heels rolled into Georgetown Saturday looking for revenge for their ousting in last years NCAA tournament at the hands of the Hoyas PERIOD Georgetown was not about to let that happen and sent North Carolina away with a  loss in a game in which the Hoyas simply outclassed the then No PERIOD  ranked Heels PERIOD
On a day windy enough to blow over the temporary chainlink fence behind the far goal the Hoyas came out with an abundance of energy and a great gameplan that overwhelmed the Tar Heels PERIOD Georgetown scored early and often to build up a  first half lead that North Carolina would never come close to threatening PERIOD
Theyre physical theyre fast and they have more depth then us PERIOD They had a lot of things that could have hurt us Head Coach Kim Simons said of North Carolinas talented squad that nonetheless struggled against Georgetown PERIOD
Ad
Sophomore AllAmerican attacker Erin Elbe opened up the scoring five minutes in on a drive towards the goal the first of her three goals on the day PERIOD Elbes goals came on only three shots PERIOD
We practiced shooting for the past week Elbe said explaining Georgetowns exceptional shooting with the Hoyas scoring  goals on  shots PERIOD
We spread things out because their D was so tight Elbe added PERIOD This resulted in more open looks at the net than Georgetown had seen in earlier losses to highly ranked teams PERIOD
That exceptional shooting continued a few minutes later with junior middie Sarah Oglesby finding the back of the net off of a beautiful feed from Elbe PERIOD Junior AllAmerican attacker Sheehan Stanwick then took over the game scoring two of the Hoyas next three games PERIOD
Sheehans first came by driving right past the Carolina defender and slamming the ball into the upper corner of the net with her second coming on a behindtheback shot that completely fooled freshman Tar Heel goalie Margaret Garofalo PERIOD Garofalo would be yanked minutes later following a score by sophomore attack Kristen Baer that made the score  Georgetown with  remaining in the first half PERIOD
They started a freshman today which kind of gave us an extra boost  PERIOD we got in her head early which kind of broke them down PERIOD When you have to put a goalie in in the middle of the first half thats not easy Simons said PERIOD
After changing goalies a North Carolina score at  would wrap up the first half scoring ending a remarkable 27minute stretch in which the Hoya defense and goaltending was able to hold the Heels scoreless PERIOD Their only first half score came on a putback after junior Hoya goalie Bowen Holden had made one save making the halftime score  but Carolina had ended the Georgetown run and was still within reach PERIOD
Holdens play in net was essential to Georgetown jumping out to the lead in the game with Bowen stopping a pair of early free position shots that kept North Carolina from taking control of the game early on PERIOD On the day Holden came up with  saves while only allowing seven goals six of which came after the Hoyas had already opened up an  lead PERIOD
Bowen is a big gameday player  PERIOD from the second I saw her this morning she looked like she was focused on one thing and thats exactly how she played PERIOD It was huge PERIOD As well as we played it still could have been a game if she didnt play as strong as she did in between the pipes Simons said PERIOD She has the ability to be one of if not the best keepers in the country when she plays like that. if things were still in question at the half Georgetown quickly resolved that with a pair of goals in the first two minutes of the second half PERIOD Sophomore attack Kate Ahearn opened up the scoring on a free position shot the first of her two goals both of which came off of free positions PERIOD Susan Stewart followed up by driving all the way down the field and scoring just  seconds after Ahearns score to give Georgetown their largest lead  PERIOD
On the attack everyone is a threat PERIOD When they go to double one particular person like Elbe or Sheehan others step up and can score Ahearn said PERIOD We had to break their trap at midfield and keep the ball on the offensive side of the field which we did. there were no superstars  PERIOD we were playing so well together as a unit PERIOD On offense you had a whole bunch of people scoring and stepping up Simons said PERIOD I have to hand it to the team PERIOD Weve been hard on them about being disciplined and making sure they are running the gameplan and today thats what they did and thats why we won. the variety in the offense continued throughout the second half with junior middies Caitlin McLean and Reagan Raneri adding scores for Georgetown PERIOD The exclamation point on the Hoyas victory however came from their AllAmerican duo PERIOD With  remaining in the game Stanwick set up behind the goal and tossed a perfect pass to Elbe catching her midstride for a clean drive towards the crease with Elbe finishing it off with a rifle into the back of the net for a  lead PERIOD
Elbes third tally on the day wrapped up Georgetowns scoring on the day finishing up the Hoyas  victory and Holden held the ball in the crease as time ran out on Georgetowns biggest victory of the season PERIOD
The three things we focused on coming into this game were that we had to play hard play together and play smart Simons said PERIOD
The Hoyas did that and then some in their victory PERIOD The win flipflopped Georgetown and North Carolina in the new womens lacrosse poll with the Hoyas rising to No PERIOD  their highest ranking ever while the Tar Heels dropped to No PERIOD  PERIOD
The win was kept in perspective however PERIOD
It was big but we do have two big games coming up Ahearn said speaking of upcoming games against topranked Maryland on Thursday and No PERIOD  James Madison next Saturday
My goal and hope is that this team has taken a step in terms of confidence PERIOD We know that were good enough to compete with aryland its just the whole mental aspect of playing such a strong team that has done really well year in and year out Simons said PERIOD The biggest thing for us is to make sure were ready to play mentally. if they are mentally ready dont be surprised to see the Hoyas come out on top PERIOD Winners of four games in a row and sporting their highest ranking ever Georgetown is in prime position to upset the No PERIOD 1ranked Terrapins PERIOD
