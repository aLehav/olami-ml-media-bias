The American Association of University Professors AAUP convened yesterday afternoon in the Faculty Club for the first of its fall meetings PERIOD The most discussed issue of the afternoon was also the most controversial unionization of the UW faculty PERIOD

 said Tony Geist the Spanish departments representative at the meeting PERIOD

The AAUP plans to discuss the prospect of unionization at length during next months meeting according to AAUP President James Gregory PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

The AAUP will meet once a month to discuss issues pertinent to the faculty and decide what steps to take in attempting to alleviate faculty grievances with the University administration PERIOD

To this end the AAUP has drafted a  report card that it plans to distribute among University faculty and administrators PERIOD

In the preliminary report the AAUP has given the University low letter grades in the categories of tenure system and salaries PERIOD The document also sets forth the grievances of the AAUP toward the administrations outreach and budget strategies as well toward the policy of adjudication PERIOD

In addition to the discussion of unionizing the AAUPs Executive Committee unanimously approved a motion to officially condemn the USA Patriot Act PERIOD The committee also passed a resolution to endorse and cosponsor an Oct PERIOD  rally with Campus Peace to be held on the second anniversary of the passage of the act PERIOD

The meeting was an intimate gathering mostly comprised of the AAUPs Executive Committee but the agenda discussed may impact the University as a whole PERIOD Key issues addressed read like a list of the UWs budgetary problems tenure and contingent employment salaries and faculty retention PERIOD

Gregory summed up the position the AAUP and University faculty find themselves in when he welcomed the new and returning AAUP members by saying 

The UW chapter of the AAUP has about  members who pay yearly dues and another  who receive the emails the organization puts out PERIOD Membership development which has been ignored in recent years has become an issue at the forefront of the committees agenda PERIOD

 said Dan Luchtel a professor of environmental science PERIOD The main goal for the State of the Faculty report is to make sure that a copy gets to every one of the Universitys  faculty members said Gregory PERIOD
