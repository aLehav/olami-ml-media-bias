7672,1970-01-01,"before the Oregon Legislature ended its session at the end of last month it passed an electoral reform bill that will only help make our state a little more democratic PERIOD State senators who voted for and against the bill acknowledged there are parts of it they would like to change but they are in a better position to keep improving ballot access now that Senate Bill  passed PERIOD Governor Ted Kulongoski should promptly sign it into law PERIOD

The bill does two things PERIOD It repeals a  law that disqualified any person who voted in a primary election from signing a petition to put an unaffiliated candidate on the ballot PERIOD That law needlessly restricted both a voters right to vote for whom they choose and a citizens right to run for public office without being a member of one of two political parties PERIOD

The other piece of the bill allows a limited form of fusion voting a system by which candidates can list the endorsements of multiple parties on the ballot PERIOD

Fusion voting allows a candidate to show that while he is a Republican he has also been endorsed by the Constitution Party for example PERIOD Democrats might also be endorsed by the Green or Working Families parties PERIOD It allows a candidate to show more precisely what kind of a Democrat or Republican she is and lends minor parties a shred of ballot access and influence in political discourse PERIOD

Fusion voting was legal in Oregon and much of the country in the nineteenth century and the Unity Party Oregons branch of the Populist Party often fused with the Democrats in electing populists to office PERIOD The law was later changed and the kind of candidates major parties were endorsing changed with it PERIOD

In  the Supreme Court said states could do away with fusion voting PERIOD Arkansas and South Dakota did just that PERIOD Though its use has waned during the past  years New York state has always used it PERIOD Today Delaware Connecticut South Carolina and Vermont all have some form of fusion voting according to the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call PERIOD

In some of these states candidates get separate lines on the ballot for each party that has endorsed them PERIOD The votes from each line are later added together and given to the same candidate PERIOD In Oregon at least for now each candidate would get only one line with the names of multiple parties PERIOD

State Rep PERIOD Jefferson Smith DPortland told the Oregonian that fusion voting gives minor parties a chance to meaningfully participate without running a candidate who will be labeled a spoiler. democratic Party of Oregon Executive Director Trent Luntz unsurprisingly painted it as a way for small groups of activists at minor party nominating conventions to buttonhole candidates and force concessions on a particular issue PERIOD

The sad part is that Luntz may be right and such tactics may be as yet the most effective method those dedicated individuals have of making a major party hear their concerns PERIOD

There are probably more democratic reforms that could be made from separate ballot lines to instant runoff voting which allows everyone to vote their conscience the first time and political expediency second PERIOD But right now Oregon has progressed enough to be able to protect the worthy components of this baby step toward reform PERIOD The governor should sign the bill and make our election system a little more open than it is now PERIOD
