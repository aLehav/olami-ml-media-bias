Cookes Rachel is a bitter and emotionally withdrawn girl whose cancer visibly advances throughout the film PERIOD She is initially distrustful of Greg but later comes to realize that he truly cares about her and can make her feel better PERIOD Cooke shows Rachels bitterness and pessimism through her facial expressions and blunt and bleak delivery of updates about her illness PERIOD
In one scene Rachel tells Greg that she decided to stop taking her cancer medication PERIOD For the first time in the film Greg shows true emotion and admits that he cares about Rachel.He becomes angry and passionate divulging into a series of broken thoughts and feelings about Rachel and why she selfishly shouldnt choose to end her own life PERIOD
This scene lands especially hard because seeing Mann act and speak so passionately underscores the severity and importance of the scene PERIOD Cooke maintains Rachels apathy and pessimism and pleads to let her make the decision for herself PERIOD The chemistry between the actors feels genuine with emotion and tension slowly building throughout the scene PERIOD
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a comingofage story that combines the quirky and witty characters of Juno with the emotional gravitas of The Fault in Our Stars. greg is similar to Juno as a witty but reserved knowitall thrust into a serious and emotional though ultimately transformative situation PERIOD The relationship between Greg and Rachel is tragic and deep eventually leading to closure similar to Hazels and Augustus relationship in The Fault in Our Stars. as Greg ultimately learns in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl connecting with others even if for a short time is always better than being alone PERIOD
