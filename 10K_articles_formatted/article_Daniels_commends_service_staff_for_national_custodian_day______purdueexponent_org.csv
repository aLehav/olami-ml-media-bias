Purdue President Mitch Daniels released an official statement Wednesday praising custodians for their work on campus in celebration of National Custodians Day PERIOD

Dear Fellow Boilermakers

In honor of National Custodians Day I want to thank all our Purdue custodians for their hard work and dedication PERIOD

I am constantly struck by how clean and well maintained our campus remains and Im not alone PERIOD Visitors to campus including Boilermaker alumni and other guests continuously mention how impressed they are by the care taken to keep our facilities in top shape PERIOD

On this occasion stop and recognize how hard it is to keep our campus looking its best and next time you see your building custodians let them know you appreciate them. daniels statement comes months after he announced a onetime  appreciation payment for West Lafayette campus staffers making less than  a year according a Purdue press release PERIOD
