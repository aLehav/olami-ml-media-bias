Today Dontae Robison and friends will make sure you know who Trayvon Martin was and what happened to him PERIOD

Martin a 17yearold black Florida student was shot and killed Feb PERIOD  by a neighborhood watch captain for appearing suspicious PERIOD Martin was unarmed PERIOD

At  a.m PERIOD today UTA NAACP members and others who want to participate will protest Martins killing by meeting on the Central Library mall where they can make posters and write notes to the slain teens family PERIOD At noon the rally will turn into a march to the University Center PERIOD Robison the groups president said the Martin situation is a personal outrage PERIOD

Were doing this to show that this injustice cant go on because if this didnt happen to Trayvon it would have happened to someone else he said PERIOD

The UTA NAACP rally follows protests across the country and the national conversation on race profiling and discrimination PERIOD It will take more than one rally to affect change Robison noted PERIOD

Its going to take more marches like these and people standing up to show that we will not stand for this injustice he said PERIOD

Watch captain George Zimmermans actions are backed by some calling it self defense and he remains free because of a Stand Your Ground law that decriminalizes murder in self defense PERIOD Such a law allows deadly force to be used when a person believes he or she is in danger PERIOD

Former Florida Gov PERIOD Jeb Bush who spoke on campus Friday as part of the Maverick Speakers Series signed Stand Your Ground legislation into law in  PERIOD During a press conference following a panel discussion on education in the University Center Bush stood by the law saying he supports the law when applied correctly PERIOD

UTA NAACP Justice For Trayvon Hoodie March

Where Central Library march to the University Center

Stand your ground means stand your ground Bush said PERIOD Doesnt mean chase after somebody whos turned their back. bush added that he understands the emotion tied to the case PERIOD

Any time there is an innocent life taken its a tragedy he said PERIOD And the fact that there is a lot of emotion is understandable PERIOD My personal belief is  and again I think any governor has gone through this at different variations  youve got to let the judicial process work and hopefully its done at a pace that is respectful for peoples hurting. fox News host Geraldo Rivera commented that Martins hoodie played a role in his death leading to more controversy PERIOD Rivera said Zimmerman and the hoodie are equally responsible for the killing.jathumbnail off

You have to recognize that this whole stylizing yourself as a gangsta youre going to be a gangstawannabe well people are going to perceive you as a menace Rivera said PERIOD

Robison said Riveras comments contributed to the theme of todays rally PERIOD

Its kind of crazy that someone would be killed because of an article of clothing Robison said PERIOD I think it played a role but it wasnt the main part. robison said he hopes the purpose of the groups demonstration is clear PERIOD

Im hoping that people will understand that this isnt just a march because hes black he said PERIOD Its a march to end injustices. follow Johnathan on Twitter JohnathanSilver
