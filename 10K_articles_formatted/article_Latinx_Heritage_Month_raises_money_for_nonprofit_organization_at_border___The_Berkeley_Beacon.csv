Five resident assistants welcomed students to the third annual Latinx Heritage Month Celebration in the Lions Den on Nov PERIOD  an event put together to raise money for organizations that help those struggling with immigration issues at the border PERIOD

Resident assistant and senior Chantal Encalada said Latinx Heritage Month is an annual event to celebrate heritage and raise awareness about important issues affecting Latin culture PERIOD

One of the biggest things we wanted to do this year is give back to the community Encalada said PERIOD Theres a huge immigration issue at the border right now so were trying to figure out ways that we can help from here. according to Encalada the RAs will donateto RAICES a nonprofit organization that provides free and lowcost legal services to underserved immigrant children families and refugees PERIOD

The organizers said they had hoped to sell raffle tickets to raise money but when they found out that they wouldnt be able to due to state law they decided to offer students the opportunity to donate money food or clothing instead PERIOD

The raffle tickets were still given out at no cost to students PERIOD Encalada said she hoped students who won prizes will donate to the cause PERIOD

During the event attendees were invited to enjoy food catered from local LatinAmerican restaurants while Latinx students performed spoken word song and dance PERIOD Behind them a slideshow played featuring paintings photographs and other works by Latinx artists PERIOD

Latinx Heritage Month takes place from Sept PERIOD  to Oct PERIOD  every yearhowever organizers said they believed the celebration was too important to only be contained within a month PERIOD The event was the third of its kind at Emerson and Encalada said she hopes it will continue to grow PERIOD

My biggest hope for next year is for people to come enjoy our food and know that we make it with so much love so much care and so much passion but also to stay for our words she said PERIOD Especially if youre trying to be an ally for this community know that we are more than just our spices. encalada said that she believes events such as the Latinx Heritage Month Celebration are important because they give students with different identities the opportunity to be heard PERIOD

It does take a lot of work and sometimes you dont have a big crowd but I know that the person who was performing had a platform and thats what matters she said PERIOD I want people of all identities to know that theyre not alone. email emailprotected
