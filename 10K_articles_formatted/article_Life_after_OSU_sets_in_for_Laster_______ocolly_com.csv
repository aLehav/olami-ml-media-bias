Apparently the Bermuda Triangle has sucked redshirt freshman Estell Laster into another dimension PERIOD



This must be the same supernatural phenomenon that pulled Jason Skaer into the netherregions of basketball mediocrity PERIOD



After sitting out a couple of games with knee problems Laster hasnt been heard from until Monday when he officially dropped out of school PERIOD Everyone seems to have a theory on his departure  from problems with playing time to differences in offensive strategies to something about a grassy knoll PERIOD



For the most part Estell played pretty well when hed enter the game PERIOD In most cases Laster and senior Chad Alexander were the first two guys off the bench for the Cowboys PERIOD



If making the starting lineup was important to Laster hed have to improve his play enough to make coach Eddie Sutton sit either sophomore Doug Gottlieb sophomore Joe Adkins or junior Adrian Peterson PERIOD



You can throw out Peterson who is as close to a goto man as Oklahoma State has right now PERIOD



That leaves Gottlieb and Adkins PERIOD



Estells more of a point guard rather than a shooting guard which only leaves Gottlieb as the possible slot for Laster PERIOD



While Gottlieb has struggled lately seven assists per game and the Big 12s top turnovertoassist ratio are hard to sit on the bench PERIOD



Another factor may have been the addition of Glendon Alexander who left Arkansas to come to OSU for more playing time PERIOD



Sure Laster could be the man at Rose State which is the school where one rumor has him checking out  but thats Rose State PERIOD



As in Rose State PERIOD



That would be like us going down to the local YMCA and taking on all the fifth graders we could handle which at this point wouldnt be very many  fewer if any of them are  PERIOD



If Estell is serious about playing division one basketball Oklahoma State is about as good as it gets  whether you want to learn the game or make the pros PERIOD



Our Sports Gimp of the Week goes to Jerry Joneswho received the award by default this week PERIOD



He received the award this week as he still hasnt named which weakwilled gimp gets to be the next cardboard figurehead of the Dallas Cowboys PERIOD Man this guy is the NFLs version of J.R PERIOD Ewing with all the wheeling and dealing and the hring and firings he makes in a day PERIOD



He won the award because no one else did anything note worthy or just plain stupid PERIOD



To the brave soul who piloted the small Piper Cub full to the brim with an OColly writer and four OSU Cowgirls basketballers we give you a salute and one first place vote for the Athlete of the Week award PERIOD



Even with the strong challenge from the pilot of the Piper Cub the third OColly Athlete of the Week goes to Desmond Mason for his performance in the win against the University of Oklahoma and during a dissapointing loss to Texas PERIOD



Mason finished the OU game with  points and shut down AllHype team member Ryan Humphrey PERIOD



Mason continued his strong performances this week with  points on 6of11 shooting from the floor against UT PERIOD
