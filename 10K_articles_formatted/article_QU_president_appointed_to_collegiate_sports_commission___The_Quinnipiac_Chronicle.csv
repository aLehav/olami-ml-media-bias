Quinnipiac University President Judy Olian was named on Feb PERIOD  to The Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics an independent leadership group that seeks to develop and promote reform within the NCAA PERIOD

Formed in  amid a series of highprofile collegiate athletic scandals the Knight Commission strives to spearhead NCAA policy initiatives that strengthen the educational mission of college sports according to the commissions website PERIOD

The Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics was founded on an unwavering commitment to the wellbeing of studentathletes Olian wrote in a March  press release PERIOD Im honored to serve with my fellow commissioners in this pivotal time of transformation in the governance of college sports. the commission comprises current and former college administrators former college athletes and other collegiate athletics experts PERIOD

Olian was appointed alongside former college athletes Kimberly Harmon head football physician at the University of Washington and professor at the University of Washington Medical School and Amy Huchthausen former commissioner of the NCAAs America East Conference PERIOD

The commission also appointed Pamela Bernard vice president and general counsel of Duke University cochair of the body PERIOD

The appointment of these four highly accomplished leaders from higher education and college athletics who bring a variety of expertise is both welcomed and needed said Arne Duncan Knight Commission cochair and former U.S PERIOD secretary of education in a Feb PERIOD  press release PERIOD

The commission has been a key sponsor of the NCAAs efforts to raise the graduation rate among Division I student athletes PERIOD Formed when the sixyear studentathlete graduation rate sat at just  the commissions calls for academic reforms helped boost the federal graduation rate among Division I student athletes to nearly  by  according to the NCAA PERIOD

Although the commission has no official authority over the NCAA the group has influenced several major policy changes since its inception more than three decades ago including the NCAAs adoption of an academic threshold for postseason eligibility in  PERIOD

The academic threshold provision which the Knight Commission first recommended in its  report requires that at least  of a teams players are on track to graduate to qualify for postseason competition PERIOD

However the federal graduation rate calculation does not consider transfer students or athletes who leave an institution in good academic standing prior to graduation PERIOD The NCAA which utilizes a more inclusive calculation to measure graduation rates among student athletes calculated a  graduation success rate among Division I student athletes in  PERIOD

Using the NCAAs adjusted calculation the sixyear graduation rate among Quinnipiac student athletes across all sports was an average  during the  academic year according to the NCAA PERIOD

The Knight Commission is currently pushing to further expand the rights of student athletes to profit from the use of their name image and likeness PERIOD

However the increasing popularity in collegiate athletics of NIL sponsorships has raised questions about gender equity PERIOD

This is the entertainment business Yanity said PERIOD Universities are going to figure out how to protect their athletes when it comes to things like this. drawing the contrast between the monetization of NIL in mens and womens sports Yanity noted that female athletes like Dunne often profit more from their conformity to conventional beauty standards than from their athletic abilities PERIOD

We can look at this as on one hand a great thing she is monetizing this Yanity said PERIOD But on the other hand there are going to be a lot of female athletes that cant capitalize on this. the commissions current initiatives also include several efforts to restructure the NCAA Division I financial model to prioritize transparency independent oversight and gender equity PERIOD

The Knight Commission notes on its website that Olian who previously served as the dean of the UCLA Anderson School of Management has a background in financial management PERIOD

However Olian is poised to succeed the Rev PERIOD James J PERIOD Maher president of Niagara University and current MAAC president as president of the conference on July   PERIOD

I am a staunch believer in the value of collegiate athletics Olian said in a February  press release about her appointment to the vice presidency PERIOD These student athletes become role models to the rest of the student community and a point of pride to the institution. cORRECTION  A previous version of this article said John Morgan associate vice president for public relations declined to comment further on role on the Knight Commission PERIOD
