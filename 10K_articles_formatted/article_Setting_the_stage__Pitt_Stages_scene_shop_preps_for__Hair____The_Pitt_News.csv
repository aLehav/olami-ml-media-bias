The environment of the University of Pittsburgh Stages scene shop is always changing PERIOD

Some days a few people quietly paint listening to music PERIOD Other days they swap headphones for earplugs as their peers cut metal noise echoing throughout the basement of the Cathedral of Learning PERIOD

For the past few weeks the shop has been in constant use as technical director Justin Miller shop foreman Eben Alguire and about  Pitt students weld drill hammer and glue together the set for Pitt Stages production of Hair. officially opening tonight at  p.m. hair will run for the next  days at the Charity Randall Theatre showing every day except Monday and Tuesday of next week PERIOD Other than Sundays  p.m PERIOD matinee showtime is  p.m PERIOD

But last night the Hair cast and crew held a free unofficial preview in the wake of this weeks election results to provide a safe space for those who felt victimized or marginalized according to ensemble member Zack Williams a senior communication major PERIOD He also mentioned the relevancy of Hairs themes to todays social climate adding that many audience members were in tears after the show PERIOD

Were using the show as a protest piece for the ideology that Washington D.C. seems to be going toward Williams said PERIOD

This year Pitt Stages picked shows that deal with themes of diversity and social justice coinciding with Pitts Year of Diversity PERIOD Hair is set in the counterculture movement of the 1960s and addresses war racism and inequality in a way that remains relevant today PERIOD

Thats why set construction is crucial  its the difference between the audience immersing themselves in the tensions of Vietnamera New York City and just feeling like theyre simply watching players act on a stage PERIOD

In the scene shop Miller had just four weeks to build a set that would transform the stage at the Randall Theatre into a something out of the 60s with vibrant colors and set pieces that represent the era PERIOD

The empty stage transformed into a makeshift hippie village with antiwar banners and picnic tables surrounding an abandoned rusting bus PERIOD

My job is to interpret the designers plan into something that the shop can build Miller said PERIOD

Much of the work done by Miller and his crew over the past few weeks has been building the bus and large metal trestles that make up the centerpieces of the design PERIOD

Not only a place for constructing sets the scene shop also serves as a learning environment where students are immersed in the process of stagecraft PERIOD

I want to make sure that the process of building the set is also an educational process Miller said PERIOD I ideally want to work on as little of the set as possible. he tries to lay out plans for the set pieces that he can then hand off to students to complete under his supervision PERIOD

Though Miller wants most of the work in the shop to be done by students he is never seen without a tool in his hands PERIOD

In addition to Miller and Alguire the scene shop has several paid employees working on the set PERIOD Megan Bresser a junior theater arts major has been working in the shop since  PERIOD

Its satisfying to see what you made be up on stage Bresser said PERIOD

Kevin McConville a junior theater arts major has worked on the last five Pitt Stages productions as a shop employee PERIOD

Each show is different PERIOD Hair has a lot of metal work and is lighter on carpentry McConville said PERIOD

The shop employees have experience with theater tech but another  students working in the shop do so for lab credit for Intro to Stagecraft a class Miller teaches PERIOD

Though many of the students working on the set are inexperienced Miller said they all find their strengths during their time working in the shop PERIOD

I have students who have never picked up a hammer Miller said PERIOD Some of them have found out that they really like carpentry or that they like painting more than they thought they would he said PERIOD

With only a few weeks to build the sets work in the shop is fastpaced PERIOD Add the inexperience of many of the students in the shop and safety becomes a concern  one that Miller does not take lightly PERIOD

Communication among the crew members is key to keeping safe PERIOD The crew calls out when they are doing something that could be potentially dangerous PERIOD

Before he cut into a metal bar a process which creates potentially damaging noise levels Sean Gallagher a student in Millers course yelled Cutting. the other crew members responded Thank you to acknowledge that they have proper ear protection PERIOD

Hair will be Millers first musical at Pitt PERIOD

Im excited about working at a place that puts on shows like this he said adding that Pitt has a good base of students who are interested in learning tech. for many involved in the production opening night is only the beginning of their jobs PERIOD But Miller and the students job is to tear down and rebuild over and over again PERIOD Audiences will see their month of hard work for a little over a week then on Nov PERIOD  the crew will demolish it all and get to work on the next set PERIOD
