Theres a new trend in cinema PERIOD The faces sitting in the dark of movie theaters are lit from the soft glow of the newsroom movie playing PERIOD And they watch the excitement of journalists frantically scrambling to write their stories on deadline PERIOD

With films such as Spotlight Truth and Nightcrawler as well as TV shows including The Newsroom and The House people are exposed more frequently to the drama of the journalism industry PERIOD

Whether or not these films offer an accurate representation of the industry is up for debate PERIOD

Every film is different but the side of journalism that we see in these movies can be overdramatized PERIOD

I wouldnt say journalism films areaccurate but sometimes the film industry is about giving people what they want Deanna Williams a freshman studying digital cinema said PERIOD

Amy Merrick a journalism professor at DePaul who worked for the Wall Street Journal and contributed to the New Yorkers Currency blog said that journalism actually can be a dramatic field to enter into PERIOD

A lot of the time in newsrooms you just see people at computers but theyre often talking to people about the most dramatic experience of their life physically or emotionally PERIOD So it can be an extremely dramatic experience Merrick said PERIOD

Opinions on journalists vary as some view them as corrupt and others see them as truthseekers and opinions on recent journalism films have varied as well PERIOD

Truth about the end of Dan Rathers career as a news anchor at CBS received mixed reviews but Spotlight about the Boston Globes work on the Massachusetts Catholic sex abuse scandal has received widespread critical acclaim so far PERIOD

The more people see examples of good journalism being practiced the more people understand and have respect for that field Merrick said PERIOD

While this certainly helps to build up a positive reputation for the journalism industry there are some ways in which certain films can do harm to journalists as well PERIOD

My bigger problem with the representation of journalism in film is the role of women and how they constantly are oversexualized Isabella Jorgensen a sophomore at DePaul with a double major in journalism and media and cinema studies said PERIOD

Its made to seem as if its not their talent or their skill thats getting them to a certain place in their industry but rather how far theyre willing to go in terms of sexual favors and gross misrepresentations of passion and drive. a January article by Marin Cogan from New York Magazine written in January titled Why Cant Hollywood Get Female Journalists Right argues that the misrepresentation of women in journalism has made an indent in peoples perceptions of women in journalism PERIOD

Cogan details how she was talking with two teenage girls about a story she was writing for ESPN about a football player PERIOD The teenagers made the assumption that she was sleeping with this football player in order to profile him for the magazine PERIOD

However Jorgensen doesnt see much of a problem with the newsroom being more dramatized for film and television PERIOD

In the end every journalism film shows a different side of the industry and affects peoples perceptions in a different way PERIOD

A comment on any industry always has potential to be damaging but when the direction of the film is about individual journalists rather than the industry as a whole it becomes a question of stereotypes PERIOD

I think its a great privilege and responsibility to communicate someone elses experience Merrick said PERIOD This helps us all understand the world better make better decisions and increase our bonds as a community. the Student News Site of DePaul University

This movie shows how tough journalism is when youre fighting organized crime and all of the criminals refuse to tell the truth and have followers and supporters everywhere

This is a movie about organized crime featuring the Catholic church the largest organized child rape crime syndicate in the history of the US and in

BRUTAL defiance of Jesus in Matt  where Jesus said childrape was unforgivable PERIOD

The Catholic church is an organized crime syndicate worse than Whitey Bulgers from Black Mass PERIOD  This movie shows how the Catholic church exhibited the

same code of silence that the mafia has without the honor as they were protecting at least  confessedpedopriests in Boston PERIOD

Whitey Bulger killed  adults PERIOD  The creepy pedopriests in the Catholic church raped over  children in Boston alone thanks to  pedophile priests

hidden and protected by hundreds of other priests including Cardinal Law PERIOD  Only  were known at the time of the movie PERIOD  The Catholic church admitted

 substantiated accused pedophile priests in the US in their own John Jay report of  and of course they lied PERIOD  The number is well over  PERIOD

And the Catholic church hid  protected  of their known pedopriests worldwide Matt  PERIOD","Journalism films like 'Spotlight,' 'Truth' dramatize industry - The DePaulia",DePaul University
