UMaines Student Newspaper since  PERIOD

In typical NBA action the beginning of the  season has already delivered several overtime games buzzerbeaters and even a few recordsetting performances PERIOD Through four games the Philadelphia 76ers stand atop the league as the only undefeated squad PERIOD Although four games out of the  in the season may not seem like much the amount of action that can take place within that span can have drastic effects PERIOD

Case in point injuries have already wiped out the leagues greatest threat for the past halfdecade the Golden State Warriors PERIOD Head coach Steve Kerr announced that shooting guard Klay Thompson will be kept on the shelf for this year eyeing a return to the hardwood for the  season PERIOD To make matters worse point guard Steph Curry is out for at least three months after he broke his left hand in Golden States loss to the Phoenix Suns on Thursday Oct PERIOD  PERIOD With a purge of talent in the offseason to clear cap space the Warriors sport only guard DAngelo Russell and center Draymond Green as their true starters with the remainder being unproven bench players PERIOD With the Warriors out of the way the league shakes up quite a bit PERIOD

A rematch of the eastern conference divisionalround game from this past NBA postseason the Boston Celtics played host to the Milwaukee Bucks on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD Boston found themselves down the majority of the game with Bucks stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton scoring  and  points with ease throughout the first  minutes of action PERIOD Boston found their rhythm late in the third quarter though rattling off multiple buckets to turn the tide heading into the fourth PERIOD After being down by  points in the third the Celtics held a fourpoint lead heading into the fourth quarter PERIOD Boston didnt look back continuing to roll on offense to their eventual  victory PERIOD

The Celtics moved to four straight wins after a tough loss to the 76ers in the first game of the regular season and appear to be quite the formidable opponent in the eastern conference PERIOD In this game against the Bucks offseason acquisition and former AllStar point guard Kemba Walker paced Boston on offense with  points PERIOD Both shooting guard Jayson Tatum and small forward Gordon Hayward turned in solid performances of their own scoring  and  points respectively PERIOD If Bostons deep bench can continue to come together under head coach Brad Stevens this squad could be reminiscent of the late 2000s San Antonio Spurs PERIOD

The main event though not everyone was prepared for it came in a showdown between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks on Friday Nov PERIOD  PERIOD Point guard Luka Doncic and power forward Kristaps Porzingis made quick work of the Lakers defensive scheme through the first quarter building a steady lead through  minutes of action PERIOD However the chemistry between power forward LeBron James and center Anthony Davis on the other end of the floor outshined the Mavericks duo PERIOD On the opening play of the night James caught the ball off the tipoff drove to the basket and laid up a beautiful lob for Davis who slammed the ball home for two PERIOD

The Lakers caught up by halftime and the whole second half saw both teams trade the lead consistently PERIOD In the final seconds with the Mavericks up by three James drove to the basket and dished a pass out to shooting guard Danny Green who made the threepoint shot at the sound of the buzzer sending the game into overtime PERIOD In the extra minutes Los Angeles rode their momentum to overpower the young Dallas squad PERIOD James and Doncic each carried their squads finishing with eerily similar stat lines including at least  points and  assists each PERIOD

Across the locker room in Los Angeles the Clippers continue to be a quiet but strong presence in the western conference PERIOD With such a plethora of talent and depth on their bench stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George can take nights off as they trust their team to get the victory PERIOD Dont look for the Clippers to have the best record in the West but look for them to be the team that steamrolls in the playoffs PERIOD James and Doncic may have the capability to carry their squad past the Clippers in the regular season but in a sevengame series Leonard and George will take over PERIOD

With all of that being said this season is still quite young and as Golden State has shown injuries can turn an annual contender into one of the worst teams in the league PERIOD The Clippers resting strategy will leave them the healthiest at the end of the regular season outside of Boston and the two deepest rosters in the league could be the last two standing come next summer PERIOD
