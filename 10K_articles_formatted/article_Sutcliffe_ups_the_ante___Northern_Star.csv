O4512 Christina Sutcliffe

By  Matt HopkinsonJune  

The softball team came within two games of winning a MAC championship title this year PERIOD

Under new head coach Christina Sutcliffe the squad turned in eight more wins than in the previous season including a winning ledger at home and a vastly improved conference record doubling its win total PERIOD

Not only was the change of coaches a positive move for the team but the coaching philosophy and aggressiveness Sutcliffe brought forward paid big dividends for the team PERIOD

Sutcliffe would employ aggressive defensive positioning against slap hitters pulling an outelder into the ineld at times to help reduce the chances of a hit PERIOD

While the credit for coaches may get tossed around too much or too little I think the biggest change was the atmosphere of the team was more positive not only for the players but for the community that surrounds the team PERIOD

Sutcliffe made more efforts for the players to be involved after the games and to open up the eld for younger attendees PERIOD Its about being receptive to all aspects of the sport not pigeonholing on eld performance PERIOD

The team already took a huge step this past season and the right pieces are in place leadershipwise for the team to be a contender PERIOD

Being two games away from a MAC title is a hard feat to back up in year two but I think Sutcliffe brings the right attitude to the game and the right approach to the community that helps the program be seen in a good light either way PERIOD
