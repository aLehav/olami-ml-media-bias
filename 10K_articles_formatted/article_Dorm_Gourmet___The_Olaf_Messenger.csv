8958,2023-11-04,"in kindergarten my teacher had us sample slices of Granny Smith Golden Delicious and Red Delicious apples and note their different qualities PERIOD Was the apple sweet red crunchy I have since expanded my apple palate but it is hard to know what you are missing when you have never tasted a variety of types PERIOD Apples are apples right Wrong PERIOD I used to be satisfied with Red Delicious apples PERIOD Today Red Delicious apples taste like old sponges with tough inedible skin PERIOD

We are incredibly lucky to have a place like Fireside Orchard so close to St PERIOD Olaf supplying us with a variety of fresh tasty fruit PERIOD I think apples taste better when I have to work for them so I go apple picking every fall PERIOD There is something special about pulling fruit right from a tree and eating it in the same place where it was grown PERIOD Apple picking is a great way to kick off the fall with friends PERIOD And make sure to get some cider and homemade doughnuts while visiting the orchard

Apples are one of my favorite fruits to cook and bake with because theyre so versatile and varied with many different flavors PERIOD Still finicky ovens and lackluster dorm kitchens make it difficult to do any intense baking PERIOD So while I would love to say that Im always whipping out apple pies this is sadly not the truth PERIOD

Making your own applesauce on the other hand is a breeze and tastes far better than anything purchased in the store PERIOD Even if you have never touched a stove you cannot ruin this recipe PERIOD Give it a try and enjoy the abundance of apples that fall brings to Minnesota PERIOD

Chunky Homemade Applesauce

Peel and slice  apples PERIOD I use Zestar apples from Fireside feel free to eat some of your slices I always do PERIOD

Cook the apple slices in a covered pot over medium heat PERIOD Add water if necessary PERIOD The apples should release their juices and soften pretty quickly PERIOD

When soft mash the apples with a fork and your sauce is done Add cinnamon and sugar to season as desired and serve hot or cold depending on preference PERIOD
