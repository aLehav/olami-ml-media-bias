Remodeled during William M PERIOD Bulgers tenure as Senate President the room had chandeliers suspended from the high ceiling which added to the golden glow an aura that enveloped those who entered for the first time PERIOD

Not too bad for a UMass Boston grad PERIOD

That UMass Boston grad is current senate president Robert E PERIOD Travaglini a Democrat representing parts of Boston Revere Winthrop and Cambridge PERIOD

It was made official when at a reception at his office several weeks ago UMass Interim President Jack M PERIOD Wilson and Chancellor Jo Ann Gora presented Travaglini with a degree from UMass Boston before various alumni who work at the State House and UMass administrators PERIOD

It was a moving presentation Travaglini said PERIOD It was something that I had no idea they were going to do but I was extremely grateful that they did. travaglini graduated from Boston State College in  eight years before it would merge with the University of Massachusetts PERIOD

People laugh or they dont believe to the degree appropriate that the best times of my life were four years of high school and four years of college he said PERIOD They were memorable. while in high school his father passed away and the familys options were limited financially for college PERIOD And as it turned out for me Boston State was the perfect place for me to continue my education build on my foundation to enhance my friendships and relationships and to prepare myself for the future he said PERIOD

Travaglini a political science major went to school at the time of the Vietnam War a time when there were protests bomb threats and student unrest he says PERIOD A whole host of conditions that arent as prevalent today as they were in the past PERIOD There was a lot of distraction constant disruption PERIOD You tried to stay focused on getting a good education. he remembers the teachers These people were extremely knowledgeable PERIOD They had a true understanding about the real nuts and bolts of politics and elective office and public service. and he remembers the classes International RelationsThat was one of the harder ones. overall it was a wonderful experience for me PERIOD It allowed me to acquire a great appreciation for the whole institution he said PERIOD I never dreamed I was going to become senate president but now that Im here and occasionally I have the opportunity to pause and reflect you think back on people and places and events that were instrumental in the development of your character PERIOD And if you can be helpful to them in return you should be. with alumni Theres constant outreach and communication he said PERIOD You know whats nice I had no idea that so many people graduated from Boston State PERIOD As soon as I became senate president wherever I go whatever event I attend almost three or four times a week somebody would say to me Boston State  Boston State  Boston State  Boston State . when asked what else could be done to reach out to alumni Travaglini responded enthusiastically PERIOD  I love thatthat clip that I saw that night was magnificent he said referring to a tenminute DVD that was shown to the small crowd that had gathered several weeks before PERIOD The piece was narrated by  Boston State grad and current WBZ reporter Dan Rea and featured some of those present that night House Majority Leader Lida Harkins and Travaglini himself as well as other UMass Boston graduates and professors PERIOD

They gotta do more of that he said PERIOD There are so many success stories that you can highlight that people can identify with. his communications director Anne Dufresne interjected saying that Travaglini had long said the UMass story was an untold one PERIOD

Travaglini agreed PERIOD Its a success story that hasnt been packaged properly that hasnt been promoted to the degree necessary. but that might be one of the many things thats now being done differently at UMass Boston PERIOD

Nestled on the second floor of the Quinn Administration building inside the Institutional Advancement offices sits the Office of Alumni Family and Constituent Relations currently headed by Diane Richardson PERIOD An alumna of UMass Boston herself she earned a B.A PERIOD in Psychology in  and returned last November to take over as an assistant vice chancellor PERIOD

What were trying to do is reengage the alumni PERIOD And not just alumni PERIOD Its alumni family and constituentswhich is families of the students retired faculty retired staff she said PERIOD Were trying to really broaden it into three different categories and reengage all of those people back with the university. numerous events are in the planning stages or taking place PERIOD During the first week of school Chancellor Jo Ann Gora will be hosting an alumni breakfast for those who work in the downtown Boston area PERIOD Another breakfast is scheduled for midFebruary targeting those in the medical field PERIOD

We also have in the works a reunion coming upthe first reunion to be held in the new Campus Center the fiftieth reunion of the Class of  of Boston Teachers College she said PERIOD

And thats what we wanted too is to bridge the two different schools yet still honor where they studied Boston State College and Boston Teachers College she said PERIOD By having the reunion at the Campus Center Thats the first step in the right direction. the Campus Center will become the new home not just for other Quinn operations like the bookstore the Registrars Office and the Admissions Office but also for the Office of Alumni Relations in a bid to increase its visibility PERIOD

Richardson has plans for monthly meetandgreets for retired staff and alumni and maybe students as well where they can find out what the alumni association is all about so that when they go to graduate its just a natural step that they want to get involved stay involved with the university. students will also start receiving the UMass Boston alumni magazine published three times a year PERIOD With the help of Computing Services the website has been cleaned up and has a current calendar of events PERIOD The office is in the process of forming an Alumni Board of Directors PERIOD And when the firstyear orientations come around in the summertime the alumni office will be involved in that too PERIOD

Theres so many opportunities so many roads and avenues that we can turn and go down that its just very exciting not only for me but its exciting for the alumni community she said later adding Its a different vision and a much more engaging one PERIOD Its going to involve more alumni and bring them back to the university. back at the State House Senator Travaglini talked of the pride he feels in receiving the degree PERIOD Its a recognition that Im truly part of the UMass family and Im a product of public higher education here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts he said PERIOD And there are hundreds of success stories that you can point to and I just happen to be a small part of that. spring
