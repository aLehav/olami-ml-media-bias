One might think a demure Disney princess and gallant displays of male bravado would characterize Disneys new movie Tangled PERIOD But Tangled at once provides unexpected twists while breaking with traditional gender roles PERIOD

Alan Menken who was responsible for the music in The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast composes the songs in Tangled all of which contribute to a sprightly musical PERIOD Be ready for whimsicality outstanding CG animation and some curveballs this is not a fairy tale youve heard before PERIOD

Based on the classic Grimm fairy tale Tangled retells the story of Rapunzel a girl born with  feet of magical golden hair PERIOD With its power to heal and save this hair stirs envy in Mother Gothel who steals baby Rapunzel so she can exploit her hair for the purpose of remaining eternally young PERIOD Rapunzel remains locked in her tower until a thief Flynn Ryder whisks her from her cloistered world and into a land where adventure awaits PERIOD

Flynn is a thief rather than Prince Charming PERIOD His personality is at once quirky endearing and believable  different from the typical bland onedimensional Prince Charming PERIOD

Perhaps the most striking break from traditional Disney fairy tale plotline in Tangled is its upheaval of the obvious gender roles PERIOD In many Disney movies damsels in distress are to be rescued PERIOD A poignant moment that challenges this ageold notion of masculinity shows the king taking off his crown and shedding a tear PERIOD Also not on par with traditional masculinity is how in many instances Rapunzel actually rescues the prince rather than vice versa PERIOD

Different from many of the more passive Disney princesses Rapunzel is hungry for adventure eager to leave the tower and accompany Flynn PERIOD

Often Rapunzels hair is what salvages the pair leaving Flynn astounded by its curative powers PERIOD Youre being strangely cryptic as you wrap your hair around my injured hand he says PERIOD

The animation is truly outstanding PERIOD When Rapunzel makes her way out of the prison with Flynn she is seeing the world for the first time PERIOD We as viewers embark on that journey with her guided along by the 3D animation vibrant colors and enlivening songs PERIOD There are some parts where the colors are so vivid and there are so many objects popping out at you that you just cant help from reaching out and trying to grab them PERIOD

A particularly striking scene is when Rapunzel and Flynn are sitting in a boat PERIOD A multitude of floating glowing lanterns encircle them PERIOD Magenta sky floods the horizon PERIOD The lanterns seem to envelope the audience making them part of this idyllic occasion PERIOD When we see such lush vivified scenery we almost want to say to ourselves is this more like a pleasant fantasy or is this how Disney wants us to believe the world looks like to someone whos been locked up for so long Are we seeing through the lens of a formerly sheltered girl who now sees everything in Technicolor

Amusing parallels can be drawn between Flynn and Rapunzels fairy tale relationship and modernday dating PERIOD The beginning stages of relationships that IlikeyouandIthinkyoulikemebutImnotsureandevenifyoudowhoknowswhatthatmeans stage are endearingly if predictably touched upon in a campfire scene where the two sit close make eye contact and hold an electric conversation while still feeling too nervous to touch or kiss PERIOD

Every Disney movie needs some comic relief PERIOD Tangled has its share of laughoutloud parts in addition to its more serious ones PERIOD Many of these laughable instances include interactions between Flynn and Rapunzels horse pal who does not like Flynn and often expresses nonverbal annoyance toward the bumbling character PERIOD Much humor can be enjoyed from the horses facial expressions alone during which Flynns sincere attempts to win the horse over result in simply more annoyance on the horses behalf PERIOD

Enter a colorful world of 3D animation and musical elation where  feet of golden hair grants power and autonomy to a modernday heroine PERIOD The music is cheery and the colors are dreamlike but dont let those qualities fool you Tangled is far from unnuanced and unsophisticated PERIOD Instead Tangled is a cinematic conglomeration of humor music female empowerment and characters portrayed as humans interacting candidly rather than caricatures reading scripts PERIOD
