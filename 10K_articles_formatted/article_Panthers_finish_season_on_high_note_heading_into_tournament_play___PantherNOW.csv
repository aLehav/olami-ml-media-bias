On May  FIU closed the regular season on a high note beating FAU  on Senior night PERIOD With the win the Panthers not only won the series but now enter the Sun Belt Tournament with a ton of momentum PERIOD

But before the game started seniors Jenny Alfonso Jenn Gniadek Kelsey Grabiak Ashley McClain and Jenny Welch were honored for their accomplishments as Panthers PERIOD It was a very touching moment for all five seniors but especially so for Pitcher Gniadek and Right Fielder McClain both of which left their imprint in FIU PERIOD

It makes you proud that they are moving on to the next stage in their lives so when they get emotional it makes you feel a little emotional as well Coach Jake Schumann said PERIOD

Both players would end up being the deciding factors for FIUs victory on Saturday PERIOD Gniadek who started the game threw a complete game and struck out an eye popping  batters PERIOD

Gniadeks most stressful inning came in the second when the Owls loaded the bases with two outs but Gniadek got out of the jam with a groundout ending the threat PERIOD
The Panthers had early opportunities to score but could not capitalize PERIOD This was never more true than in the fifth inning when Shelby Graves hit a single and advanced to second on an error PERIOD

A groundout would later move Graves to third but FIU could not bring her home as after a Welch walk Jessy Alfonso grounded out PERIOD

FIU also had an opportunity to score in the fourth when McClain and Brie Rojas both hit back to back infield singles with two outs but could not score PERIOD

But the Panthers made up for that in the sixth frame when Kayla Burri opened things up with a single which was then followed up by a homerun off the bat of McClain putting FIU up  PERIOD That homerun gives McClain  in her career the most in school history PERIOD

Gniadek would close things up in the seventh securing the win and improving her record to  on the year PERIOD
FIU will now head to Boca Raton for the start of the Sun Belt Conference Championship held from May  at FAU stadium PERIOD FIU with the No. seed will take on No. seed Troy at  A.M PERIOD This season FIU lost the series against Troy two games to one PERIOD

Winning the tournament is the only way you get to keep playing for the year and if you dont you go home Schumann said PERIOD But the tournament is suppose to be fun and suppose to be competitive and without a doubt thats whats going to happen. sports
