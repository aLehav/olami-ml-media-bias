This culmination of tension was bred by declining sales for major retailers such as J.Crew Nasty Gal and Ralph Lauren and rather subtle inflections that would prove paramount in terms of relevance and sales social medias influence over buyers activity and its introduction of the newage shopper. while many companies can sigh with relief at surviving some of these recent challenges there is no doubt that the new year will breed other struggles and provide novel insight to ongoing ones PERIOD

In the midst of talks about new style trends  the 80s resurgence billowing bell sleeves and so on  it is imperative that students already working in fashion are keen on other topics of interests that relate to this fields very operation PERIOD

Especially for Atlanta which is consistently moving up in rank as the next major fashion capital in the United States a claim supported by Southern Living in article titled Will Atlanta Be the Souths Next Fashion Capital Retail is experiencing remarkable uncertainty making sustainability is more crucial than ever and social conditions are
forcing businesses to rethink how and to whom they target products PERIOD

All hope is not lost however PERIOD The  Fashion Industry Benchmarking Study by Dr PERIOD Sheng Lu indicates that in regards to the future  percent of participants say that they are optimistic or somewhat optimistic. still with so much restructuring to occur simultaneously it is time to take these issues more seriously PERIOD

These are all the areas that will be of great importance in  to industry rookies and pros alike PERIOD

Social Aspects

Diversity a buzzword that took center stage last year and rightfully so will undoubtedly continue to shape the world of fashion in  PERIOD The previous year points to bringing these issues to the forefront PERIOD Not just to designers but for brands and retailers also PERIOD

Additionally acts of appropriation were forcefully addressed Marc Jacobs dreadlocks fiasco models of color demanded equal opportunity and standards of beauty were boldly challenged such as Maria Borges opting to wear her natural short hair during the Victorias Secret Fashion Show two years in a row PERIOD Efforts did not go unnoticed PERIOD

The Fashion Spots diversity report said that Of the  Fall  shows at NYFW . percent of the models cast were white and . percent were nonwhite. quite impressive as the Spring shows of the same year saw only . percent nonwhite models according to the diversity report PERIOD However there are more strides to be made PERIOD The report also states that no plussize models were featured in the Spring shows and that only two of the  toprequested models were of color PERIOD

Georgia State student models from organizations like Panthers Allure have ample opportunity to approach local agencies while the pressure is still on to add variety to their lineups PERIOD Even with so much cultural variation and aspiring models in Atlanta the more elite fashion shows still lack models of color PERIOD Agencies to consider include Click Factor Chosen and Ursula Wiedmann all of which manage talents well PERIOD

Ethical Sourcing and Sustainability

Going green may have once seemed like just another hipster fad but sustainability has planted its foot into society forcing fashion companies to scale back and become more thoughtful PERIOD All across campus and the city recycling bins and clothing banks are placated proudly for everyone to see and use PERIOD But this year the fixing of these issues will be internally PERIOD

According to the United States Fashion Industry Associations  Benchmarking study increasing sourcing cost is the number two concern for fashion businesses in the country PERIOD Adding to this designers and the stores offering their garbs have been pressured to be familiar with materials sources and to publish their efforts in saving the planet PERIOD

Admirable deeds Yes but there are potential negative effects that directly impact the local economy PERIOD The trends show rising sourcing costs and sustainability strides could increase product prices PERIOD More than ever customers want to know that companies are involved in environmental protection and will provide quality garments at reasonable
costs PERIOD

The issue however is that ethical sourcing and sustainability practices are still in the alphatesting stage PERIOD Therefore stores will have to try various approaches  which may include cutting staff not hiring new employees or reducing the number of individual items purchased in the buying process PERIOD While apparel stores are figuring it out consumers can chip in by taking advantage of clothing recycle options like those available in all HM stores locations PERIOD

Business Strategies

This news is just the latest example of fashion businesses making unfortunate decisions in order to stay afloat PERIOD Implementing modern strategies will top many companies list as consumer behavior continues to change PERIOD The keyword this year is streamline meaning businesses will have to slash significantly in certain areas and systematically enhance others PERIOD

Stores are expected to further develop the online shopping experience making it easier for shoppers to find products and their information PERIOD It will be clean have easy navigation of the site and have checkout options to fit every type of customer PERIOD Of course this puts a dent in the success of brick and mortar versions of a company which can also affect jobs and instore product availability PERIOD But experts predict physical locations will pick sales back up so dont expect Lenox Malls crowd to subside any time soon PERIOD In fact this year businesses can finally figure out how to meet the demands of digital and traditional shoppers PERIOD

Expect to see more brands selling online exclusive offers while instore arrangements become carefully selected and less cluttered PERIOD Fast Company reports that Birchbox CEO Katia Beauchamp said she predicts that in  customers will increasingly visit stores to get curated experiences from shop representatives. in a nutshell Fast fashion will slow down PERIOD Meaning the tasks of stores will be to meet the demand of new age customers who seek personalization PERIOD Shoppers are no longer shopping just to have a full closet PERIOD Instead modern shoppers want shopping to be an experience in which they are buying items that truly speak to who they are PERIOD

It wont be long before stores in the area adopt personal shopping techniques as a part of its customer service PERIOD The bleakness surrounding the fashion industry is not to be overlooked rather viewed as a time to facilitate required changes and replace old methods with creative progressive ones PERIOD Over the next  months optimism and hard work will lead this change PERIOD
