With freshman forwards Moussa Diabate and Caleb Houstan both declaring for the NBA Draft the Michigan mens basketball team faced a lack of depth at the forward position  until now PERIOD

The Wolverines have found a piece to help fill that void PERIOD On Friday Michigan acquired former Duke forward Joey Baker via the transfer portal as reported by Sports Illustrateds Jason Jordan and confirmed by CBS Sports Jon Rothstein PERIOD

After his senior season with the Blue Devils Baker opted to use his additional COVID19 year of eligibility as a graduate transfer PERIOD And three weeks after he announced his decision Baker chose where hed play his final year of basketball at Michigan PERIOD

Last season with Duke the 6foot6 forward averaged . points . rebounds and . assists in . minutes per game PERIOD While the numbers he put up may seem underwhelming his shooting abilities will be key for the Wolverines in the upcoming season PERIOD

As a team Michigan shot  from three in the  season with fifthyear guard Eli Brooks leading the way at . percent PERIOD Bakers . 3point percentage tops that and positions him as a shooting threat for the Wolverines PERIOD

It remains unclear who will fill Diabates and Houstans starting lineup spots or the amount of playing time Baker will see PERIOD Many speculate that risingjunior forward Terrence Williams II will fill one of the voids and incomingfreshman forward Jett Howard will fill the other opening PERIOD

Baker  who started just four games in his four years with the Blue Devils  will likely begin the season on the bench PERIOD Despite that Baker will bring an important presence  whether that comes in a starting role or off the bench  to a frontcourt that currently lacks depth PERIOD

With two forward positions to fill in the starting lineup picking up Baker will seemingly make a significant improvement to a backcourt that remains unestablished PERIOD

In addition to his skills on the court the leadership and experience that Baker brings will be advantageous to a Michigan team that lacks a clear identity at this point in the offseason PERIOD
