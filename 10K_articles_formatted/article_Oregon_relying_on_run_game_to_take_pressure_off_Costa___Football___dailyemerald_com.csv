7675,1970-01-01,"there are no two ways about it the Oregon football team is dinged up and the hits just wont stop coming PERIOD

And as the Ducks prepared for their first road game in over a month there was no telling what the Oregon roster might look like come game time PERIOD



Up to this point the Ducks have been playing without running back LeGarrette Blount defensive backs T.J PERIOD Ward and Walter Thurmond III and this week the Oregon secondary took another hit as senior cornerback Willie Glasper  Thurmonds replacement  went down with a seasonending knee injury PERIOD Yet despite the injuries the Duck pass defense has continued to improve weektoweek PERIOD



We worked hard in the offseason T.J PERIOD Ward said PERIOD I think we just have a lot of hungry guys out there and theyre anxious to make plays. while the defense has been the more injuryprone unit this season the offense and team in general took a major hit with the injury to junior quarterback Jeremiah Masolis right knee PERIOD During the past two games he had turned into the Masoli of old going  of  for  yards and four touchdowns while running  times for  yards and another score PERIOD



USCs had to play two quarterbacks UCLAs had to play two quarterbacks Oregon head coach Chip Kelly said PERIOD Its a deal in this league where if you dont have a backup quarterback youre probably going to be in a little bit of trouble. filling in as the starter will be junior Nate Costa who was actually ahead of Masoli on the depth chart at the beginning of last season before going down with his third knee injury PERIOD

Im completely confident in Nate center Jordan Holmes said PERIOD They battled all through the spring and this fall PERIOD Both are great football players and if they werent they wouldnt be here. costa has seen some playing time the past two weeks and has been able to be consistent and not make mistakes during the time hes given PERIOD Against Cal he went four of seven for  yards and was sacked once then followed that up with a strong performance in the second half last weekend against Washington State PERIOD Costa went seven of nine for  yards and also ran six times for  yards and a touchdown against the Cougars PERIOD



Im feeling pretty good Costa said in practice this week PERIOD I just continue to get better and my passing game is on par. costa will have the help of an offense that has improved every single week which includes the talented redshirt freshman running back LaMichael James who has run for  yards and three touchdowns on  carries over the last two weeks PERIOD



James along with fellow redshirt freshman Kenjon Barner junior Remene Alston and senior Andre Crenshaw have provided a deep and versatile running game which should take some of the pressure off of Costa PERIOD



All four of us right now are doing great things Crenshaw said PERIOD Its fun when all of us get to play because we all want to score touchdowns PERIOD We all love when we get to play. crenshaw the veteran of the running back corps has taken it upon himself to help James with some of the smaller things in practice that will make him a better player on Saturdays PERIOD



I tell LaMichael everyday just go out there and have fun Crenshaw said PERIOD Play football PERIOD Its that simple PERIOD We all know you can do it PERIOD Were behind you and here for you. crenshaw also said part of his job as the veteran is to make sure guys like James are focused as well as helping them out with plays and passing protection PERIOD



They get better each week Kelly concluded PERIOD Theyre young PERIOD They get better each game as they start to see things  its neat to see their development. lclarkdailyemerald.com
