Basement Arts in association with the Graduate Studio Project will present Heather McDonalds  play Dream of a Common Language this Friday at  and  p.m and Saturday at  p.m PERIOD in the Arena Theatre PERIOD

McDonalds play centers around the difficulties of a husband and wife couple and is set in France within the era of the first Impressionist studio PERIOD During a dinner to plan their first exhibit the men exclude the female artists by neglecting them and forcing them to dine in the houses garden PERIOD All of the female artists have similar credentials to their male counterparts but have given up painting for reasons of their own PERIOD Cloise is the wife of Victor but her ambitions are crushed when her husband and male peers ridicule her work during an exhibition PERIOD Victor on the other hand builds his reputation as an artist on nude portraits of his wife PERIOD The tension between the two over love and art the personal and the professional builds barriers that prevent either reaching fulfillment in their relationship PERIOD

This is Director Cara Gabriels fourth production at the University PERIOD What sets this play apart from her other works or even other performances of this play she feels is the university environment PERIOD She and her staff have created a unique method of presentation PERIOD What weve done is weve made the whole stage a canvas so that the play becomes a painting on a canvas Gabriel said PERIOD This is done by laying canvas on the floor and literally framing the audiences perspective PERIOD

Another aspect that separates this play is male and female nudity within the production PERIOD Theres nothing gratuitous nothing graphic about it  you only see their backs said Gabriel PERIOD Gabriel has also made a slight change in character gender PERIOD From a historical point of view Shakespeare cast boy actors as women and now we have a young women cast as a boy its interesting to me to see gender representation because it is a feminist play. gabriel adds that the character is convincing as the son of Victor and Cloise PERIOD

On the other hand Gabriel said I think this play on the negative side has the potential to be seen as a man hater play. but at the same time the man and the woman love each other very much PERIOD The man wants to make the woman happy help her understand and thats why its a common language PERIOD All the characters are struggling to find a way to come together PERIOD Its not about being kept apart she said PERIOD It is about the women not being allowed PERIOD Despite the confrontational start It ends with a coming together and a reaching of this common language PERIOD I want people to leave feeling optimistic. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
