by  Kate NelsonPublished  June  

Life just hasnt been the same since seriousness became so important to us PERIOD Not love Things are getting serious nor work I want to be taken seriously or even truth Im serious this time PERIOD

Case in point Earlier this week I was well knocking Knocked Up. i must admit that despite my appreciation for Will Ferrell Steve Carell and the rest of the gang Wedding Crashers and The 40YearOld Virgin did not make my top10 list PERIOD Or my top100 list for that matter PERIOD

You see Im more a fan of films that leave you feeling enlightened acting with more cultural awareness or at least sobbing like a baby PERIOD So when I first saw the previews for the aforementioned boxoffice hit I was not impressed PERIOD In fact my exact words were something along the lines of What a waste of time money and studio space. much to my chagrin however several of my friends saw the Katherine Heigl hit and have deemed the flick hilarious which at first infuriated me almost as much as did the fact that The New Yorker dedicated more than a paragraph on its precious pages to review the flick PERIOD

Flash over to my current hobby the great American job search PERIOD And I swear Im getting to a point. ive spent many a year and many a tear trying to figure out just what path I need to take to get where I want to go  or more aptly described where I should go PERIOD What field and form of employment can leave me fulfilled help me impact the world around me and allow all this to be done in a way that others respect

Back when there were no immediate ramifications a.k.a PERIOD when I was years away from entering the job force I was determined I would chase seriousness wherever it lead me PERIOD

Now Im not so sure PERIOD

After all Ive got plenty of time ahead of me when Ill have no choice but to be serious so why push it now It seems Ive already allowed it to sneak into numerous areas of my life where it has no right to be and serves no purpose PERIOD

It all comes back to the idea that has been set up in our society that the only option besides seriousness is frivolousness PERIOD And no one wants to live a frivolous life weve been told PERIOD Unfortunately most Americans see this as a dichotomy rather than as a spectrum PERIOD

Despite popular belief frivolousness doesnt deserve any less merit than its counterpart seriousness does PERIOD When and why was the former deemed less important and less capable of making an impact than the latter

There is an appropriate time and place for both PERIOD And each of us will likely lean more toward one end of the spectrum PERIOD But that doesnt mean we should pat the doctors back and not the actors PERIOD

Im doing my best to dispel the seriousfrivolous dichotomy in my mind that has had such jurisdiction over my thoughts and actions and I encourage you to try it on for size PERIOD

I still wont be dishing out the dough to see Knocked Up but why should I give my friends such grief for enjoying it

Maybe they are right Maybe it is seriously hilarious PERIOD
