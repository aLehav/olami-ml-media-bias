The University of Colorado football team  snapped a 14game conference losing streak against Oregon State last week.This weekend the Buffs will travel to UCLA to face the Bruins  in a Pac12 showdown PERIOD

To paraphrase the great Steve Young the monkey is finally off the Buffs backs PERIOD

Despite the outcome Colorado looked stumped for a fair amount of the game PERIOD The passing game declined in its first game without sophomore wide receiver Shay Fields who suffered a high ankle sprain two weeks agoagainst Arizona PERIOD

After throwing for more than  yards in the last two games junior quarterback Sefo Liufau passed for only  yards PERIOD

You lose a little bit of speed but I trust every other receiver that I have Liufau said PERIOD I trust all those guys and I expect them to make plays and expect them to get open. the game plan last weekend required Liufau to do more than throw however PERIOD He also led the team in rushing attempts with  and gained  yards andone touchdown PERIOD

Hes one of those quarterbacks that the other team doesnt like to see run coach Mike MacIntyre said PERIOD You dont see people really wanting to go hit him all the time. the run game against Oregon State was balancedbetweenfive different rushers PERIOD In total the Buffs gained  yards at . yards a carry PERIOD The team totaled  carries helping Colorado control the time of possession  to  PERIOD

Now Colorado sets its sights onNo PERIOD  UCLA PERIOD Last week the Bruins won by  points against Cal PERIOD Freshman quarterback Josh Rosen threw for  yards and three touchdowns withoutan interception PERIOD

Trying to stop Rosen will be a tough job for the Colorado defense PERIOD The freshman is at the helm of a UCLA offense that ranks twenty-fifth in the country in passing with 1969yards this season and  touchdowns.Colorado is giving up . passing yards a game 58thin the country PERIOD

On the ground the Bruins are averaging . yards a game.Thats quite the number PERIOD Its especially daunting considering the Buffs are ranked 110thin rushing defense.If Colorado cant stop UCLAs run game itll be a long day for the defense PERIOD

The defense may be in for some improvement though PERIOD This will be the second game junior linebacker Kenneth Olugbode will play after coming back from his injury against Oregon PERIOD Against Oregon State last weekend he was second on the team with seven tackles while also recording a sack and a pass breakup PERIOD

Coloradosoffense may also be in luck PERIOD UCLA isstruggling against the run this year PERIOD Theyre tied for 104thin the nation in rush defense PERIOD The Buffswill look to utilize the run game much like theydid last week against Oregon State PERIOD

This spooky game will air this Halloween Saturday on the Pac12 Network PERIOD Kickoff is scheduled for  p.m PERIOD MST PERIOD
