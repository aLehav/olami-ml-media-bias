Leah Porath has played at UWO for four years but with this year not counting towards eligibility she will be able to play basketball as a Titan for one last year in the  season PERIOD

Cory Sparks Sports EditorMarch  

Leah Porath is a star point guard on the UW Oshkosh womens basketball team who has made her name known as one of the best Division III players in the country PERIOD But her peers say she is also one of the best people in her community PERIOD

Poraths basketball roots are deep as shes been playing the sport since early elementary school PERIOD She started playing basketball at  before becoming the accomplished DIII hooper she currently is as the leading scorer on a  Titans team PERIOD

Basketball has played an extremely important role in her life PERIOD

Basketball has been more than just a sport to me Porath said PERIOD Basketball brings joy and excitement into my life PERIOD It gave me a reason to set goals and strive for accomplishments. porath came to UWO as a  New London High School graduate and a foursport athlete with four varsity letters in basketball and softball and two in swimming and volleyball PERIOD

As a freshman peers quickly noticed Poraths humble composure and hardworking intellect PERIOD

Leah was very quiet at first but when you got to know her you quickly found out that she wasnt the quiet one at all said fellow teammate and senior Nikki Arneson PERIOD I would best describe Leah as that teammate who is always the hardest worker on the floor PERIOD She is always setting the bar high with her effort and determination. poraths combination of assertive play and constant humility was noticed by her coaching staff and she became a household name in her conference as well as in the country by the time her junior year rolled around PERIOD Her ability to freeze defenders and routinely score in the double digits was on full display throughout her junior season PERIOD

My first impression of her was that this is a player who works extremely hard on her game but does so very quietly said assistant coach Matt Kelliher who has known Porath since her junior season PERIOD She plays very aggressively without arrogance PERIOD Her skills are something that any coach would love to have on their team. porath has come a long way since her basketball debut in second grade as she was named as the  NCAA Division III Public School Womens Basketball Player of the Year by the Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association was named as a  thirdteam all American by D3hoops.com was voted to the allCentral Region first team by D3hoops.com was named the  Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference WIAC Player of the Year was named to the fiveplayer D3hoops.com Womens Basketball Team of the Week in November  and February  and led the WIAC in points per game in  with . pERIOD

Poraths individual success comes so frequently that as this story was being written she scored a schoolrecord  points against UWRiver Falls in the first round of the WIAC tournament on March  PERIOD

Even with all of these individual accolades Porath identifies her biggest accomplishments as ones that she has achieved with her team PERIOD

During my time here at UWO I would say the biggest accomplishments I have been a part of would be winning the WIAC conference tournament twice and making it to the sweet  twice Porath said PERIOD Being a part of those postseason runs is something I will never forget. poraths consistent optimism is something that has also caught the attention of those around her as she always seems to find a way to put a positive spin on every situation PERIOD

When it comes to basketball and liferelated things Leah will always try to look at it from the bright side Arneson said PERIOD You rarely see or hear Leah talk or act in a negative way PERIOD She is always looking on the positive side of things. along with her optimism comes some humor PERIOD Even as a hardworker who takes the process of perfecting her craft seriously its not beyond Porath to make a situation comical PERIOD

Even though shes quiet Leah has got a great sense of humor dry humor Kelliher said PERIOD

Porath said she continues to play and work hard at the game of basketball because of the life lessons that the game offers PERIOD But she also credits her familys support for motivating her to continue to better herself PERIOD

Porath said she appreciates the way that the game of basketball and those around her are able to mold her into a better version of herself PERIOD

I have learned that in order to become your best self you have to set goals and push yourself to achieve them Porath said. my parents have encouraged and pushed me to become the person I am today PERIOD But my support system doesnt end there PERIOD My grandparents aunt and uncles cousins friends teammates and coaches have always been there for me PERIOD I definitely wouldnt be where I am today without them. kelliher has noticed Poraths persistence to improve and he believes that her greatness will extend far beyond the success that she has enjoyed as a collegiate basketball athlete PERIOD

Leah is someone who has the drive and determination to be great at whatever it is she is doing and after her playing days are over she will do more incredible things Kelliher said PERIOD Everyone should know that Leah is much more than a basketball player shes a great person. as a senior Porath is beginning to reflect on the components of college basketball that she will miss most PERIOD Her flashy highscoring talent has made it clear that she will miss those around her more than anything else as her college career comes to a close PERIOD

I will miss the people at UWO the most PERIOD The friendships that I have made these last four years is something that I am truly grateful for Porath said PERIOD

But shes not done yet PERIOD With the  basketball season not counting toward player eligibility UWOs star has unfinished business to attend to PERIOD

I am fortunate to be able to come back and play one more year Porath said PERIOD Hopefully I will be able to cut down a few more nets and be a part of another NCAA postseason run next year. multimedia
