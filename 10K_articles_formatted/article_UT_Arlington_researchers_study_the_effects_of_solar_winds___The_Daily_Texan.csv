5954,2023-07-11,"solar wind significantly alters Earths magnetic field which can affect Earths communication technologies PERIOD

Richard Bonde a physics graduate student at UT Arlington studies space weather and its effects on Earth PERIOD Space weather refers to atmospheric conditions on and generated by the sun and can determine the performance of space and Earth based technological systems PERIOD

According to Bonde the Earths magnetic field blocks out harmful particles emitted by the sun PERIOD

The sun emits particles called solar wind and its always streaming out of the sun at roughly a million miles per hour Bonde said PERIOD The reason we get space weather is that the solar wind is disturbed and carries parts of its own magnetic field to interact with and shape Earths magnetic field Bonde said PERIOD

This interaction is called the interplanetary magnetic field PERIOD

The intensity of solar wind wavers depending on the year and is determined by the suns changing seasons which Bonde said dont match Earths PERIOD

The sun undergoes an 11year cycle which greatly affects space weather PERIOD During a period called solar maximum the sun emits intense solar flares and coronal mass ejections PERIOD Solar flares are bursts of energy from the sun and coronal mass ejections are an eruption of the plasma on the suns surface PERIOD The sun experienced its most recent solar maximum in  PERIOD

The coronal mass ejections that are big will create a shockwave that accelerate the solar winds towards the Earth and its space weather Bonde said PERIOD

GPS and radio signals must avoid or overcome the changes in space weather in order to precisely reach the Earth PERIOD

The solar flares are bursts of energy that can affect radio communication and accelerate harmful particles from the sun Bonde said PERIOD

Bonde said that the GPS signals must travel through the ionosphere a region of the Earths atmosphere that forms a plasma due to electrons and ions PERIOD When the suns radiation comes into contact with the ionosphere the protons and electrons from the signal split apart weakening the GPS signal PERIOD

According to Bonde other GPS signal disturbances can occur when the particles from the signals of GPS satellites in space become trapped in the Earths radiation belts PERIOD If the signals are not properly protected their particles can get embedded in radiation belts resulting in weaker signals PERIOD

A significant change in solar weather can also affect Earths infrastructure according to Bonde PERIOD

Geomagnetically induced currents a really strong storm that compresses our magnetosphere can induce currents in power lines here on Earth blowing out transformers Bonde said PERIOD

Yue Deng UTArlington physics professor is currently developing a computer simulator to monitor and predict changes in space weather PERIOD Bonde uses the simulator for his own research PERIOD Deng said in the future she hopes the computer simulator can serve as a valuable tool for space weather research PERIOD

My biggest goal for the computer simulator is to build a next generation simulation capabilitywhich will be very beneficial for space weather forecast Deng said PERIOD
