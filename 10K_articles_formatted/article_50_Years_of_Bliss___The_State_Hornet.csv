Tradition leads the way this weekend as Sacramento State takes on the U.C PERIOD Davis Aggies Saturday in the fiftieth annual Causeway Classic at Fred Anderson Field PERIOD

The Hornets improved to a record of  this past weekend when they were victorious over the Idaho State Bengals  PERIOD

Sac State quarterback Ryan Leadingham torched the Bengals defense with a schoolrecord six touchdowns to become the alltime leader with  PERIOD

The Hornets are riding a wave of momentum coming in this weekend to face the  Aggies but both teams remember the results of last years game at Hughes Stadium PERIOD

The Aggies toppled the Hornets  in the presence of  fans PERIOD

Some people here on campus wouldnt care if we were  head coach Steve Mooshagian said as long as that one win was against UC Davis PERIOD If you get caught up in one game early in the season you could lose perspective. davis  Most Improved Player quarterback Ryan Flangian threw for  yards and completed two touchdowns PERIOD The Hornets had numerous opportunities to surpass the Aggies but self destructed on drives that had them in position to score PERIOD

With the past behind them the Hornets hope their offensive showcase from Saturday nights game will carry over when the visiting Aggies come to play.Besides the spectacular performance of Leadingham Tyronne Gross showed no compassion for the Idaho States defense PERIOD This was Gross thirdstraight game for  yards or more PERIOD

The quarterbacks of Sac State have been able to find Amey and Smith who have combined for  receiving yards and five touchdowns in the last two games PERIOD The productivity of Amey and Smith has proven to be reliable PERIOD An increase in the receivers statistics looks to be probable if the Aggies defense fails to pressure Leadingham PERIOD

Coming off a bye week the Aggies will be fresh and rested to face the Hornets PERIOD They are a solid fundamentally skilled team that has the ability to wear down teams offensively and defensively PERIOD

I like the Causeway Classic because it is all about the players Davis head coach Bob Biggs said PERIOD I wont remember this game in three years but they will always remember it. in their last game against Texas State quarterback Ryan Flangian passed for  yards and a touchdown in a  loss PERIOD Flangians offensive connections are Nolan deGraaff Daniel Fells and Aaron Pluckett PERIOD The trio totaled  catches for  yards against Texas State PERIOD

This season running backs O.J PERIOD Swangian and Antar Mahasin have mustarded up a total of  carries for  yards and five touchdowns in three games PERIOD Leadingham and the Hornets offensive line will need to be clicking on all cylinders if they want to score against Davis PERIOD Recent opponents of the Aggies have been victims of their devastating defense PERIOD

Davis has forced seven sacks and four fumbles tallied up  tackles and intercepted the ball three times PERIOD Defensive backs A.J PERIOD Avila Derick Daniels and Ejiro Evero will have the task of shadowing Amey Smith Girley and company over the field PERIOD

The senior class has never lossed to Sac State Evero said PERIOD Itll be pretty special I want to go out on a good note. evero forced a pair of fumbles and had one interception against Texas State PERIOD

The Hornet defense allowed the Bengals to total  yards on Saturday but made key third down stops  ISU had to punt six times  denying the Bengals looks at the end zone PERIOD

Top tacklers Jeremy Johnson Park McAllister Kevin Tennerson and Ryan Kroeker will need to continue to contain if they intend to make it  at home PERIOD
