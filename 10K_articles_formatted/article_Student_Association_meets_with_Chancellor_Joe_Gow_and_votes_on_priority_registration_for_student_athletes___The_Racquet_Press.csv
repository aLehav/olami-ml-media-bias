Julia Wille Student Government ReporterOctober  

On Wednesday Oct PERIOD  the University of WisconsinLa Crosse Student Association SA invited two guest speakers including Chancellor Joe Gow PERIOD SA discussed mental health on campus COVID19 restrictions and updates as well as diversity and inclusion at UWL PERIOD Several students came to the open body forum to express their concerns about activities on campus PERIOD SA also discussed the implementation of a policy that allows studentathletes to have priority registration for classes PERIOD

The first student to come forward at the open body forum was UWL student Jake Williams PERIOD Williams came to voice his concern about the response of UWL to the issue of suicide and mental health issues at UWL PERIOD He laid out some action item suggestions for SA to take and try to change the situation PERIOD Williams first asked that UWL and SA should formally state and recognize mental health as a priority PERIOD His second ask was that UWL pushes for the end of normalization of suicide on campus PERIOD This was said in response to the recent email sent out by UWL about the student who committed suicide PERIOD Williams said that more action needs to be taken than just a cookiecutter email. lastly Williams suggested that UWL move to have the Counseling and Testing Center be fully funded PERIOD He said I have heard from students that there are a lot of barriers to the Counseling Center because of a waitlist or not enough hours for urgent meetings. the next student to speak at the open body forum was UWL student Jonathan Idarraga who is the president of the Latin American Student Organization LASO PERIOD He came to discuss the email that was sent out by UWL campus police on October seventh regarding the sexual assault notice PERIOD Idarraga said There was a backlash from the student body for language that perpetuated victim shaming. he said that LASO had talked with Campus Chief of Police Allen Hill and that he was receptive to what was being said and is willing to work with students to rework the language of future emails. hill is looking to bring together an informal panel of diverse voices on campus to brainstorm the best language to use moving forward PERIOD

The third student to speak at the open body forum was UWL student and captain for the UWL swim and dive team Jacob Brehmer PERIOD Brehmer is also the president of the studentathlete advisory council SAAC PERIOD He came to voice student athletes opinions on the passing of a resolution to allow studentathletes to register for classes early PERIOD He said studentathletes struggle every semester to schedule classes around the rigid practice and game schedules. uWL is the only UW school in the WIAC that does not allow studentathletes to register earlier than the rest of the student body PERIOD This resolution was discussed at greater length later in the meeting PERIOD

After the student body open forum SA welcomed UWL Chancellor Joe Gow as the first guest speaker PERIOD Opening his discussion Chancellor Gow wanted to address the concerns about mental health and suicide response on campus PERIOD Chancellor Gow said UWL has dedicated talented and caring people responding to these situations and so I was disappointed to hear the term cookie cutter. he expressed the concern and sadness that he feels to hear that a student of UWL would commit suicide PERIOD He also said I hope everyone is taking care of themselves and that everyone can destress if you can. following the discussion surrounding mental health Chancellor Gow also gave an update on the COVID19 response efforts PERIOD He discussed the concern of a potential rise in cases after Oktoberfest but reported to be no large spike in cases after the festivities and the positive cases reported had decreased PERIOD He also acknowledged the questions being asked by students and outside parties of the campus about when the mask mandate could be lifted PERIOD He said the classroom remains like an airplane and on airplanes people are still constantly wearing masks. chancellor Gow discussed the increased level and risk of exposure while sitting in a classroom for an extended period so this mandate will be staying in place PERIOD He discussed the possibility of less strict regulations in other settings as cases go down PERIOD Chancellor Gow said As we see these numbers of positive go down we will be thinking about how to get back to normal PERIOD I am fairly confident that this can happen in this academic year. chancellor Gow also discussed access to COVID19 booster shots and said that the university will make it as easy and accessible to students as soon as its available PERIOD

Chancellor Gow also discussed his plans to rename two buildings on campus PERIOD He is hoping to rename the Student Union after Lillian B Smith Davenport who was the first black woman to graduate from UWL PERIOD He is also looking to rename the Center for the Arts after Truman Lowe who is a wellknown indigenous artist in the La Crosse community PERIOD He is looking to make this change to try and honor the diversity on campus PERIOD Chancellor Gow said I want to tell the history of this university and make it more inclusive and welcoming. the second guest speaker to visit SA was the Director of REC Sports Jeff Keenan PERIOD He is the new director and has been on campus since July PERIOD Since then he has been working to listen and learn what is important to UWL and its students specifically within the rec but also on campus PERIOD He came to the SA to introduce the changes and goals that are being set in the REC PERIOD By Spring of  there will be a renovated outdoor connections space as well as a new ecommerce area PERIOD Keenan said REC sports can be a player in many different dimensions of wellness. sA also discussed the new campus ecochallenge they are taking part in PERIOD The ecochallenge is a challenge that allows students to cut down on inefficient or harmful consumption for a limited period PERIOD SA is promoting this challenge and the UWL challenge name is Stryke Out Climate Change PERIOD To be a part of this you will have to go to thewebsiteand sign up PERIOD The challenge will run from October  to November  PERIOD

SA also passed a resolution in support of allowing studentathletes to have priority registration for classes PERIOD The resolution would allow studentathletes to have ahead of class registration opportunities to help accommodate their academic and athletic schedules PERIOD According to Athletic Senator Kat Fitzgerald UWL is one of two schools in the UW system that does not have this policy in place PERIOD Senator Kate Lochner said it will have a very small impact on the rest of the student body. she said this referring to the data brought up that studentathletes at UWL only make up  of the student body PERIOD There was a lot of debate on the equality of this policy PERIOD Many senators mentioned concerns about fairness for other groups such as individuals in the arts PERIOD Senator Morgan Hose said band and choir students have the same concern as that being an extracurricular group. in response to this Senator Fitzgerald said that she had originally looked to include these groups of students but when she asked individuals they did not express as much of a need to her PERIOD Senators also discussed the negative impacts that not having this policy could have on UWL PERIOD Senator Lochner brought up an incident where she met with a father and son that was being recruited to play baseball at UWL and they had discussed attending another school because UWL did not already have a policy in place that helped studentathletes balance school and sports PERIOD In response to this story Senator Ryan Sperling said if we are actually losing students because we do not have this this is not only damaging to the current studentathletes but also to the potential future athletes. sA debated this policy at length trying to decide whether to pass the resolution PERIOD In the end the resolution was voted on and passed with contention a majority of senators voting for the resolution with a few voting against it PERIOD The policy still needs to go through at least three more levels of analysis and approval before it can be put in place PERIOD
