3224,2023-11-04,"the Marquette mens soccer team suffered a tough  overtime loss to the Georgetown Hoyas at Valley Fields Saturday night PERIOD

Senior Georgetown defender Ted Helfrich scored the game winner  his first goal of the season  in extra time to give Georgetown the win PERIOD The decisive score was set up by senior forward Steve Neumanns corner kick which Helfrich headed home from about six yards out PERIOD

This loss is the Golden Eagles first in Big East conference play and it also snapped their fivegame winning streak PERIOD They are now in a firstplace tie with Georgetown who has beaten Marquette in each of their last five match ups including a  doubleovertime victory in last years Big East Tournament semifinals PERIOD

Congratulations to Georgetown they came with a good game plan and executed it coach Louis Bennett said PERIOD I still thought we really put our stamps on the game PERIOD Its disappointing but weve put ourselves in a position to at least have a share of the title. although Marquette tallied  shots compared to Georgetowns  the Hoyas put six of their shots on goal while the Golden Eagles could only muster five PERIOD Senior defender Eric Pothast said it was a tale of two halves in terms of each teams scoring chances PERIOD

We didnt play our best soccer in the first half Pothast said PERIOD We wanted to step it up defensively in the second half PERIOD Wanted to have more energy and go after it a little more and as you could see we kind of took over the game more in the second half. the Golden Eagles had plenty of clean looks in the final  minutes but they just could not find the back of the net PERIOD Freshman forward Coco Navarro initiated Marquettes attack when he sent a shot over the crossbar in the seventy-fourth minute but the team kept its foot on the gas PERIOD Unfortunately Lysak had his third shot of the day saved and redshirt sophomore forward C PERIOD Nortey suffered two near misses in the next  minutes PERIOD

Marquette has not scored a goal since Louis Bennett IIs gamewinning score in the seventy-third minute against Providence  days ago PERIOD Following that game the Golden Eagles drew  against Saint Johns before their most recent matchup with the Hoyas PERIOD However Bennett said he is not panicking after his teams most recent setback PERIOD

This loss isnt the last game were going to play so we can learn from it Bennett said PERIOD I think the university has a good group of guys very talented group and a brand of soccer that you can stick behind PERIOD Playing this way were going to win more than we lose. marquette will host Seton Hall Saturday Nov PERIOD  at Valley Fields PERIOD Senior Bryan Ciesiulka said he is excited for the senior night game PERIOD

Im looking forward to getting us back on the winning track Ciesiulka said PERIOD
