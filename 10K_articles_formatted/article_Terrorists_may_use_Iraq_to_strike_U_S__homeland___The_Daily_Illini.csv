By Katherine Shrader July  

WASHINGTON  The terrorist network alQaida will likely leverage its contacts and capabilities in Iraq to mount an attack on U.S PERIOD soil according to a new National Intelligence Estimate on threats to the United States PERIOD

The declassified key findings to be released publicly on Tuesday were obtained in advance by The Associated Press PERIOD

The report lays out a range of dangers  from alQaida to Lebanese Hezbollah to nonMuslim radical groups  that pose a persistent and evolving threat to the country over the next three years PERIOD As expected however the findings focus most of their attention on the gravest terror problem Osama bin Ladens alQaida network PERIOD

The report makes clear that alQaida in Iraq which has not yet posed a direct threat to U.S PERIOD soil could become a problem here PERIOD

Of note the analysts said we assess that alQaida will probably seek to leverage the contacts and capabilities of alQaida in Iraq AQI its most visible and capable affiliate and the only one known to have expressed a desire to attack the homeland. the analysts also found that alQaidas association with its Iraqi affiliate helps the group to energize the broader Sunni Muslim extremist community raise resources and recruit and indoctrinate operatives  including for homeland attacks. national Intelligence Estimates are the most authoritative written judgments of the  spy agencies across the breadth of the U.S PERIOD government PERIOD These agencies reflect the consensus longterm thinking of top intelligence analysts PERIOD

The White House brushed off critics who allege the administration released the intelligence estimate at the same time the Senate is debating Iraq PERIOD White House press secretary Tony Snow pushed back at the critics Tuesday saying they are engaged in a little selective hearing themselves to shape the story in their own political ways. we dont keep it on the shelf and say Lets look for a convenient time Snow said PERIOD

Were trying to remind people is that this is a real threat PERIOD This is not an attempt to divert PERIOD As a matter of fact  we would much rather  one of the things wed like to do is call attention to the successes in the field in Iraq he said PERIOD

Democrats said the report was proof U.S PERIOD antiterrorism efforts were being drained by the Iraq war PERIOD

We must responsibly redeploy our troops out of Iraq handing responsibility for security over to the Iraqis and leaving only those forces required for limited missions said Rep PERIOD Ike Skelton DMo. chairman of the House Armed Services Committee PERIOD This will allow us to concentrate our efforts on Afghanistan and the alQaida terrorists who attacked us on . house Republican leader Rep PERIOD John Boehner of Ohio said the report confirms gains made by Bush and blamed Democrats for being too soft on terrorism PERIOD

Retreat is not a new way forward when the safety and security of future generations of Americans are at stake he said PERIOD

The new report echoed statements made by senior intelligence officials over the last year including the assessment of spy agencies that the country is in a heightened threat environment. it also provided new details on their thinking and concerns PERIOD

For instance the report says that worldwide counterterrorism efforts since  have constrained alQaidas ability to attack the U.S PERIOD again and convinced terror groups that U.S PERIOD soil is a tougher target PERIOD

But the report quickly adds analysts are concerned that this level of international cooperation may wane as  becomes a more distant memory and perceptions of the threat diverge.",Terrorists may use Iraq to strike U.S. homeland - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
