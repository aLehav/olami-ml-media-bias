Economy analysts are blaming the weather for slow job growth in March PERIOD

A recently released report from the Department of Labor shows  jobs were added to the economy in March well below the predicted number of  jobs PERIOD In January and February  and  jobs were added respectively according to revised numbers from the Department of Labor PERIOD

An unseasonably warm March across the U.S PERIOD  which broke daytime heat records in  cities  threw off seasonal adjustment models for job growth for example construction workers hired during the winter were never laid off so they didnt need to be rehired in March PERIOD

Analysts said it could also have been the warm weather that led to relatively high employment gains in previous months this year PERIOD

Former deputy assistant secretary for the Department of Labor Patrick OKeefe said in an editorial for USA Today the economy was still showing economic growth just at a more modest rate

of . percent PERIOD

He said he expects approximately  jobs on average to be added per month for the remainder of the year PERIOD

If the economy continues to steadily post gains in employment at that rate  adding  jobs per month  it will take about  years for . million unemployed Americans to find work bringing the nation back to the prerecession  percent unemployment rate PERIOD

The jobs report also said that the unemployment rate has fallen from . to . percent PERIOD This is purely because more Americans    dropped out of the labor force and stopped looking for work during March PERIOD

There is still an unchanged . million Americans who fall under the longterm unemployed those who have been without jobs for  weeks or more umbrella PERIOD

The lessthanpromising report didnt do anything for the stock market either PERIOD Investors are wary to invest because of the weak job market and concerns about the euro zone  although a  billion bailout package for Greece was announced at the end of February so fears about the European crisis are less imminent PERIOD

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped  points falling below  for the first time in a month and the SP  index saw all  of its industry groups fall after the jobs report was released Friday PERIOD

The jobs report did have some positives PERIOD Average hourly wages increased to . which is  cents higher than last month PERIOD

Also later recalculations of job figures often yield higher numbers than previously announced PERIOD The February jobs report initially said  jobs were added to the economy but when the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised its jobs data finding  jobs were actually added PERIOD
