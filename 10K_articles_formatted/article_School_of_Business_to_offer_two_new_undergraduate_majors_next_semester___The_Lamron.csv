Per the School of Business website The Data Analytics major is a rigorous program that equips students with the skills required to collect organize analyze and model data to draw sound conclusions PERIOD The major aims to train wellrounded data analysts who are not only technically proficient in analyzing data but who also know how to responsibly use data to make decisions think critically and communicate effectively PERIOD The Finance major is based on an integrated core that provides all students with a deep foundation in markets investments and operational corporate finance PERIOD Through the core and an extensive menu of approved electives students acquire a combination of theoretical insights and practical modeling abilities that prepare them for entrylevel positions in banking investment services personal financial planning and corporate financial management. mary Ellen Zuckerman Dean of the School of Business said that the majors were added in response to the number of students interested in pursuing these topics beyond the scope of a minor and to give students extra opportunities to succeed in modern job markets PERIOD

We already have a lot of minors in both of those areas and we knew students wanted to be able to take it as a full major PERIOD I think whatever their major is whether its in the business school or outside the business school its really important to keep students minds open to everything new that theyre hearing and learning in their classes and outside of their classes PERIOD Were in a time of really rapid change and that provides a lot of opportunities PERIOD Theres a lot of career opportunities and job opportunities for students PERIOD and its really a great time to be learning and to be at a place like Geneseo where were really preparing students to go out into that exciting and transformational world she said PERIOD

Zuckerman explained that the process for adding new majors to the Geneseo curriculum was a long and thorough task PERIOD

She said The major must be approved at the level of the entire college PERIOD In order to create new majors the college must create it within the school or department and it must go through our curriculum committee before we approve it then it can go to the college senate curriculum committee PERIOD Of course before we even do that we must make sure that the provost whos the Vice President for all Academic Affairs is supportive of it and approves it then finally the President must sign off on it. according to Zuckerman in addition to being approved at the college level the new majors were approved by SUNY administration and an independent assessment by the New York State Department of Education PERIOD

SUNY administration looks at it and they send out a notice to all the other SUNY schools to say look Geneseo is creating this undergraduate finance major and data analytics major and ask if anybody has any comments PERIOD Then after SUNY approves it it must go to the state education department which all colleges public and private must have programs approved by she said PERIOD One of the requirements is that we have external reviewers come in and look at the program PERIOD Two faculty from other schools who had expertise in these areas came in and they looked at the major they talked to the faculty and to the students and the administration just to make sure that the major is appropriately created and appropriately staffed and supported. in order to make the majors available Zuckerman said that the School of Business had to hire new faculty to teach data analytics courses PERIOD

Last year since we knew we were going to be going forward we hired a new instructor whos teaching this year already PERIOD And since one of our data analytics instructors retired last spring were just finishing up the search for somebody to replace that person she said PERIOD

Zuckerman said that the School of Business was also looking to add a marketing major another minor that students showed interest in exploring as a major PERIOD

Weve just started working on another one and thats a marketing major but it wont be finalized until  because theres a pretty long approval process through the state. geneseos student newspaper since  PERIOD
