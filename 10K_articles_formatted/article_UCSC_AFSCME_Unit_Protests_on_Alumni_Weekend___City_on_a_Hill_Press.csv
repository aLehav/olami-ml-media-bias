981,2012-05-03,"agroup of around  members of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees AFSCME Local  UC Santa Cruzs Skilled Crafts Bargaining Unit demonstrated at the base of campus on Saturday from  a.m PERIOD to noon PERIOD

Campus electrician Gary Riggs said the unit was protesting in response to questionable paycheck practices from UCSC PERIOD

Before our contract was expired in the end of September the university started taking additional pension contributions out of our paychecks and pension contributions are a mandatory subject of bargaining Riggs said as cars driving by honked in support PERIOD The union on behalf of the Skilled Crafts Bargaining Unit filed an unfair labor practice charge against the university for taking these additional pension contributions and not bargaining in good faith. the Public Employment Relations Board PERB which describes itself as a statewide quasijudicial administrative agency filed a complaint against UCSC on March  PERIOD

UCSC failed and refused to bargain in good faith  in violation of Government Code section 3571c according to the issued complaint PERIOD

Riggs said AFSCME Local  is currently in contract negotiation with the university and he hopes for a fairer shake when they meet for mediation on May  PERIOD

Were trying to get job protections right now for the first time in the Skilled Crafts Bargaining Units history Riggs said PERIOD This last year we suffered layoffs PERIOD We had a bunch of people retire and not be replaced PERIOD So were being asked to do more work with less people and were looking for job protections in the form of stronger language in our contracting out article. riggs said that as the contracting article currently reads the university can lay off union employees and give their work to outside contractors with no consequences PERIOD

UCSC director of public information Jim Burns said contract negotiations between AFSCME and the UC happen at a statewide level PERIOD

The parties have been negotiating since last September for a successor agreement and it would be fair to say that reaching agreement over the remaining issues has been challenging Burns said in a email PERIOD Because of that the parties have mutually agreed to meet with a state mediator next week to facilitate what Im sure everyone hopes will be productive dialogue. aFSCME union representative and organizer Rebecca Gilpas said that the unions demands should not be much of a stretch for the university PERIOD

We feel like were not asking for much said Gilpas who has been with Local  for about a month PERIOD Were asking for improvements in health care PERIOD Workers are already putting in enough money out of pocket and we dont want that to stay as is. family Student Housing carpenter Orin Hutchinson said that in the face of budget problems the universitys priorities dont make sense PERIOD

Weve had layoffs in our unions where we did have a fiveperson physical carpentry shop and now theyre down to two people he said PERIOD At the same time the university is adding millions of square feet of new buildings yet theyre actually shrinking the number of employees that maintain and work on those buildings. riggs who held a sign that read Reunion with Recognition and Respect said the demonstrations coincidence with Alumni Weekend was strategic PERIOD

Theres a lot of people coming up here a lot of donors he said and were hoping to have an impact and put a little pressure on the administration to do the right thing at the bargaining table. hutchinson said that although the unit is small  its total membership is   he is hopeful that AFSCME Local  stands a chance of getting what they want PERIOD

We are the only union that this university itself UC Santa Cruz bargains with he said PERIOD Were not a statewide entity PERIOD Were local to this campus and we bargain our own contract with help from a union negotiator PERIOD I think that one person can make a difference. city on a Hill Press is produced by and for UCSC students PERIOD Our primary goal is to report and analyze issues affecting the student population and the Santa Cruz community PERIOD
