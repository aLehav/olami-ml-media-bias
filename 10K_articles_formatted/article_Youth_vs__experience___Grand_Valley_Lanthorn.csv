After ending an exciting  season placing first in the GLIAC Swim and Dive Championship meet last year the Grand Valley State mens swimming and diving team came into the national meet with more confidence than ever before PERIOD

For those who qualified their spring break plans were put on hold as they prepared to compete in the NCAA Division II National Championships PERIOD The National Championships were held Wednesday March  through Saturday March  PERIOD

The mens team managed to place fifth in the meet as their season officially came to an end PERIOD The hard work didnt stop there as team members like MariusMikalauskas found time to continue swimming in meets working diligently in preparation for next season PERIOD

We have a couple of swimmers that went to their home countries and swam in their national championships and did really well said Andy Boyce GVSUs mens swimming and diving head coach PERIOD Marius Mikalauskas was Lithuanian National Champ in the  breaststroke this summer so that was a nice thing for him but so far it sounds like theyve worked pretty hard and theyre ready to go. not only are the Lakers getting ready for another season but the team has also recruited  incoming freshmen allowing the team to become more diverse skillwise PERIOD

Our teams a little bigger this year than what they were last year Boyce said PERIOD We have some real young talent on the team and are excited to see how they are working to our training program and how they can help in the dual meets and in the championship meets as well. gVSU swimmers Jared Gregory and Joe Gucwa have both spent all four years on the GVSU swimming and diving team PERIOD The two are regarded as some of GVSUs best divers as they were rewarded for their leadership with the title of being the teams current diving captains PERIOD

Being on the team as long as these two have has created experiences for both Gregory and Gucwa similar to what every freshman goes through PERIOD Becoming captains of the team has pushed them to have bigger roles in the development of the rest of the team members careers academically and athletically at GVSU PERIOD

Just helping them through and keeping them focused in class and in the pool being able to balance time management and be there for them to talk to as a support system and to push them Gregory said PERIOD

For Gucwa he feels the pressure to perform better than last season PERIOD There is a lot of new talent transitioning on the team and it is pushing this captain to achieve more for the young crew PERIOD

We have a really good incoming class for freshmen divers so its really going to push me to step up my game Gucwa said PERIOD Also just to help them improve as much as they can PERIOD Its about knowing whether to help them or push them when they need it. according to Boyce the team prefers the competition and thrill of racing PERIOD Luckily for them the teams schedule is packed with a variety of different events PERIOD The Lakers will be faced with big challenges this season PERIOD

During a trip to Florida to work on training the Lakers expect to have their firstever meets against Division II teams they wouldnt regularly see PERIOD They are also expecting to have trips that include meets against some of the top  teams that were competing in the National Championship last year PERIOD

The Lakers should anticipate a busy season but not one they cannot handle PERIOD GVSU swimming fans should look forward to another successful meet at the GLIAC Swim and Dive Championship PERIOD

Im super excited just to finish out and just see what the underclassmen can actually do and hopefully propel them in a direction that will keep our streak going in conference Gregory said PERIOD

The Laker mens swimming and diving team starts the beginning of its new season Saturday Oct PERIOD  against Wisconsin Milwaukee PERIOD
