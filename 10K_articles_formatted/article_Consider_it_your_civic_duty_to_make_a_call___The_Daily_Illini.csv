Tuesday nights 4inch snowfall was a lot more than what weve seen in the past few weeks but it was certainly no surprise considering January is known for being one of the snowiest months in Illinois PERIOD While we might have narrowly missed some of the coldest days in ChampaignUrbana during winter break theres no doubt that winter isnt over yet  just take a look outside PERIOD

The snowfall has made walking to class treacherous and traveling Green Street at night a huge hassle and theres no telling when well be out of the woods PERIOD But complaining to your friends about the sidewalks and streets not being plowed shoveled or salted isnt going to change anything PERIOD

The passage of Champaigns snow removal ordinance last year required property owners to clear or apply abrasives to sidewalks around their buildings within  hours of a significant snowfall or risk a bill after the city handled the removal PERIOD

And last year the snow ordinance seemed to be working well PERIOD Lately though weve seen more snowy sidewalks and unsafe walkways and not enough shovels PERIOD However we cant say that the city of Champaign is necessarily at fault its a difficult ordinance to enforce PERIOD In fact if the sidewalk from your apartment to the street isnt cleared and you dont say anything about it you might even be adding to the problem PERIOD

While it is the landlords and property and business owners direct responsibility to clear their sidewalks its your responsibility to make a formal complaint if it doesnt happen  not just walk down the hall to your roommate PERIOD



The relative inconvenience of a phone call is incomparable to slipping and sliding all the way to the Quad for classes PERIOD

So often residents of ChampaignUrbana assume students are not truly a part of the community PERIOD Contributing to a plan meant to help everyone that lives and works here is a small step toward eliminating that perception PERIOD

If you own property in the Campustown or downtown districts its your responsibility to be sure that you make every reasonable effort to clear the walks around your business or building PERIOD

If youre trudging around Campustown when the weather gets nasty surviving the walk can be made easier if every member of the community contributes PERIOD

Think of it as your civic duty to make that phone call or find a way to clear the sidewalk PERIOD Only good can come from everyone contributing rather than just complaining PERIOD",Consider it your civic duty to make a call - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
