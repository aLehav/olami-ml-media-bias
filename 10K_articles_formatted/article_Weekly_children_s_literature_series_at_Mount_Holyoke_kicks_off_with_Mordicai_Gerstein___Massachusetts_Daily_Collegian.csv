I remember the feeling of my fuzzy slippers and my white canopy bed PERIOD I remember the glow of my nightlight PERIOD But the thing I remember the most about getting ready for bed as a child were the bedtime stories PERIOD I always longed to hear just one more fighting heavy eyelids PERIOD

A personal favorite story that stays with me today is Tell Me Something Happy Before I Go to Sleep by Joyce Dunbar PERIOD Many of us hold our favorite memories from childrens books and carry the lessons we learn from them with us PERIOD We remember that sharing is caring stealing is bad and eating our vegetables will make us superheroesIm still waiting on that one PERIOD

Regardless of the message or the specific narrative childrens literature serves an immeasurable purpose in the lives of kids PERIOD

In fact Margaret K PERIOD McElderry a popular childrens book publisher who died just six years ago once stated that she saw childrens books as the foundation of the publishing industry PERIOD If you dont catch them young you wont have any adult readers she said PERIOD

Mount Holyoke College both recognizes and rejoices in this belief during its  Childrens Literature Series which takes place every Thursday at  p.m PERIOD in the Cassani Room in Shattuck Hall PERIOD

This past Thursday I attended the first of five events sponsored by the Margaret Knox McElderry Childrens Literature Fund and the Mount Holyoke College department of English PERIOD It was hosted by Mordicai Gerstein a seasoned childrens book author and illustrator PERIOD

Surrounded by wooden bookcases clothbound books and dusty Persian rugs Gerstein began his talk with a personal anecdote from his childhood about being caught by his mother doodling on the floor after being left alone for a short time PERIOD

Gerstein said although he never dreamed of being a writer ever since that childhood moment his family has joked he started drawing before he could walk and he feels a true connection to that memory

Later Gerstein discussed his creative process points of inspiration and the familiar sense of writers block PERIOD

Gerstein said hes always viewed books as a tangible representation of someones imagination PERIOD Reading a book is like holding someone elses imagination in your hands he said PERIOD

Gerstein noted that when he first began his career he often wrote stories from his childhood embellishing details along the way and filling in gaps in his memory with what he wished happened next PERIOD

Regardless of the particular events in the story Gerstein stressed the importance of a childrens books organization PERIOD Theres a sequential art in picture books he said PERIOD Its like a little theater in your head. valuing his own sense of sequential order during the talk Gerstein broke his creative process down for the audience PERIOD

He explained he often starts with longform his hand acting as a scribe for whatever comes to mind PERIOD He said his original ideas often stem from another book a personal event or a social issue PERIOD

Then comes the clarification process where Gerstein works to remove all the words that dont help to shape the overall picture PERIOD

His third step involves taking the text and breaking it down into single lines so they can be easily illustrated on a page almost like poetry PERIOD

After this he begins doodling the scenes living in his head playing around with the pages to figure out exactly what he wants to represent in his illustrations PERIOD

Gerstein stressed the chosen words and images must have an equally clear impact for the page to be cohesive PERIOD This is important in all literature but even more so for children PERIOD

Once his text is decidedly concise he begins to piece together what he called his dummy book. the dummy book contains a collage of word clippings from previous drafts with slowly developing illustrations PERIOD

Gerstein said his personal rule of thumb is to organize the book in way that makes people want to keep turning PERIOD To do this he puts an unanswered question or unsolved mystery on the right hand page prompting people to flip and continue on with the story PERIOD

A component of drafting the actual book Gerstein said hes always struggled with is deciding what point of view to write the But one thing remains true in all his pieces and that is he writes to find out what he knows and for the general love of storytelling PERIOD

Gerstein used the word mythosphere meaning the whole world is made of stories waiting to be told PERIOD He added that hes particularly drawn to narratives with a human and animal connection and ones with people doing unusual and extraordinary things in the face of some kind of adversity PERIOD

When asked about his expansive career and if hed always planned to create such a large repertoire Gerstein responded I never knew what was going to come next  sometimes I thought nothing ever would. during the QandA after the talk Gerstein was asked who is favorite author was growing up PERIOD He responded with a look of bemusement and said he couldnt choose PERIOD But he added that hed always appreciated the strange and funny tales of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll PERIOD Adding they were like nothing hed read before PERIOD

The discussion was full of candid moments from Gerstein such as when he spoke of the days he used to love using oil paintbefore his wife became allergic that is PERIOD

In his final statements Gerstein added the believed in the importance of childrens literature because as a child your life and its events are terrifically important  perhaps even more so than now. gina Lopez can be reached at emailprotected PERIOD
