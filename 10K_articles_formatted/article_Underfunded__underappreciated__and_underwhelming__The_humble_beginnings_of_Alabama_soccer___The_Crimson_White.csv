7941,2021-03-13,"when Janko Emedi took a job teaching Russian at The University of Alabama in  he pushed for the creation of a soccer program PERIOD

Emedi by all accounts was a renaissance man PERIOD

Having escaped his homeland of Yugoslavia with his family at the age of  he bounced around the U.S. first living in Chicago then finding a home playing soccer at University of AlabamaHuntsville then studying at the University of Indiana PERIOD

It was there in Bloomington that Emedi first found a love for coaching as a soccer coach at a local YMCA PERIOD From there Alabama soccer took root PERIOD

Prior to Title IX in  womens collegiate athletics had been essentially nonexistent but now colleges had no choice but to create teams for them to play on PERIOD

In  one of those teams was soccer PERIOD

Emedi was given just two months to field a team PERIOD In these  days he managed to pull together  players mostly freshmen from the South PERIOD

Emedis squad played a tough schedule in his words which primarily consisted of Division II and III schools from the South PERIOD But Oct PERIOD  marked the biggest game of the year for the Crimson Tide  a trip to Nashville to take on Vanderbilt PERIOD

The Commodores were the only other SEC school with a soccer program having launched one the year before PERIOD

The teams were both severely underfunded and outmatched PERIOD The two teams agreed halfjokingly that the winner of the game would be able to call itself the SEC champion PERIOD

The honor did not go to Alabama as the Commodores defeated the Crimson Tide  PERIOD

After finishing  in year one Alabama turned things around in  PERIOD Despite returning just three players from the previous team the Crimson Tide went  avenging many of the last years losses in the process while playing Vanderbilt to a scoreless draw PERIOD

But an  loss to North Carolina late in the season made it clear that this program still had a lot of work to do PERIOD The Tar Heels were  and still are  the class of college soccer PERIOD Coached by the legendary Anson Dorrance IV North Carolina had won four of the five NCAA championships played up to this point and would capture a fifth this season PERIOD

North Carolina was the gold standard PERIOD In total the Tar Heels would go on to win  of the first  NCAA Championships while being led by icons such as Mia Hamm PERIOD Dorrance is still at the helm to this day as arguably the most decorated coach in the history of sports PERIOD

This Alabama team had a good story but was just wholly unable to compete with a team like the Tar Heels PERIOD

The  season further illustrated this PERIOD

Its really looking good for us Emedi said of the program heading into this third year PERIOD

The Crimson Tide returned most of its players and there was reason to believe the team could take the next step and make an NCAA tournament PERIOD

But following an  season in  punctuated by a  loss to the Commodores athletic director Steve Sloan pulled the plug on the program PERIOD

Soccer at The University of Alabama was no more PERIOD

The school decided it would be better fit giving scholarships and funding to the volleyball team PERIOD

The girls on the  team all either transferred to other programs or stayed enrolled as regular students at the University PERIOD Emedi went on to work teaching English as a second language and coach soccer at Warren Central High School in Kentucky never again returning to the collegiate level PERIOD

For six years soccer was nowhere to be seen at the University PERIOD

Then in late  right before the World Cup athletic director Hootie Ingram the man best known for hiring Gene Stallings reinstated the program PERIOD

The process for launching the program was much more coordinated and drawn out than the first time around PERIOD First Don Staley was hired as head coach in December  giving him a full nine months to recruit and plan for the start of the  season PERIOD

Staley was someone who lived breathed and slept soccer PERIOD

He started playing at the age of  and by his sophomore year of high school when he realized he was not good enough to play college football devoted himself to being a fulltime goalkeeper and played on a partial scholarship at Virginia Wesleyan University before being kicked off the team due to a low GPA PERIOD

Following that his hopes of playing professionally were dashed when he broke his leg in an allstar exhibition game in  PERIOD At this point Staley directed his attention to coaching taking over at Radford University PERIOD

In his nine seasons there Staley simultaneously coached the Highlanders mens and womens teams taking the women to an NCAA Tournament no small feat for a school that small PERIOD He achieved sustained success and not wanting any of his players to go down his path put a high emphasis on academics PERIOD

So in  there really was no debate over who was going to get the job at Alabama PERIOD

Staley also interviewed for the job at Auburn another SEC school that was launching a program but knew he wanted to come to Ttown from day one PERIOD

When I was offered the position it was like a dream come true Staley said PERIOD I was getting to coach and live at a prestigious university in the most prestigious league in the country PERIOD I sought out the Southeastern Conference because I wanted to go to a very competitive school that was adding the sport. also different this time around was the supporting cast PERIOD While Emedi had just one assistant albeit a great one in Philip Dodds Staley had a whole crew around him PERIOD

First there was Karen McGrath a former player at Radford PERIOD

Coach Staley and I had a unique professional relationship McGrath said PERIOD We sort of feed off each other PERIOD On the field I tend to be the coachs right hand PERIOD We work pretty closely together PERIOD Theres nothing I dont do as a coach. joining McGrath on the staff was graduate assistant Laura Topolski and Tim Ramsden a volunteer assistant working primarily with the goalies PERIOD

In addition to the coaching staff the team had a trainer equipment manager promotions director information director and strength and conditioning coach PERIOD

Furthermore ground was broken on the Alabama Soccer Stadium where the team still plays to this day PERIOD It was a true designated facility that could meet all the teams practice needs while providing a great fan atmosphere for home games PERIOD

The University had finally invested in soccer and just through this commitment a message was sent PERIOD

This was not going to be a team fighting for its survival PERIOD Soccer was not at risk of ever being cut from the school again PERIOD Before the team had even played a single game everyone knew that it was here to stay PERIOD

The difference between this squad and the 80s squads was clear immediately PERIOD

First of all the  team boasted players from all over the country decorated high school athletes from everywhere from New Jersey to New Mexico PERIOD

On the field Alabama was elite going  with a  conference record PERIOD

But unfortunately while the Crimson Tide spent six years not playing the Commodores were improving PERIOD

Vanderbilt dominated the  matchup in a  rout of Alabama en route to an SEC Championship PERIOD

The Crimson Tide was good but not great PERIOD

In his  years as head coach Staley established the Crimson Tide as one of the most consistent programs in the SEC winning multiple SEC Coach of the Year awards in the process and becoming just the fifth NCAA soccer coach at the time to win  career games PERIOD

But the fact of the matter still was that the team could not reach that next level PERIOD

In  it all came together PERIOD

After having notched the programs first ever tournament win the year before head coach Wes Harts squad shocked the soccer world by making it to the College Cup losing to eventual champions UCLA in the national semifinals PERIOD

It was a breakthrough for the school and the entire year served as a homecoming of sorts for Crimson Tide soccer alumni who came back to watch the program they had helped build PERIOD

Seeing them come back   years after they finished playing is just insane senior forward Gessica Skorka said of the former players PERIOD It shows just how dedicated they are and how much this meant to them PERIOD Their passion is really exciting. but one persons support in particular meant a little extra PERIOD

He was awesome Hart said of Don Staleys support of Alabama soccer PERIOD Weve had a relationship ever since I took the job here PERIOD We got in touch and we talk a few times a year PERIOD Hes really proud of where the programs come PERIOD Hes a big supporter of us and it means a lot. staley currently serves as the CEO and founder of the Southeastern Network of Athletic Professionals a consulting firm specializing in issues such as Title IX name image and likeness deals and the transfer portal meaning that he is still working with college athletes PERIOD

Its my goal to give back to the industry to which I have dedicated  years of my life by providing innovative solutions to destination marketing organizations sports commissions sporting venues and facilities municipalities and studentathletes to help achieve economic impact and personal goals Staley wrote on his LinkedIn profile PERIOD

Alabama soccers success has carried over into this year PERIOD For the first time in program history the Crimson Tide spent the entire season ranked inside the United Soccer Coaches Top  and earned wins over bigtime opponents PERIOD

Regardless of how the remainder of this season shakes out Alabama soccer is in great hands with Hart at the helm but it would not be possible without Emedi Staley and all the players assistants personnel boosters and fans who supported Alabama soccer in its infancy PERIOD","Underfunded, underappreciated, and underwhelming: The humble beginnings of Alabama soccer â€“ The Crimson White",University of Alabama
