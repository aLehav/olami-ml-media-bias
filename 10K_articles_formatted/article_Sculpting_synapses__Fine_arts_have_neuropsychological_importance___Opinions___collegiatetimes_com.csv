Humanities Week returned from Oct PERIOD  to  with free online and inperson events around Virginia Techs campus PERIOD

Virginia Tech mens soccer fell to No PERIOD  North Carolina Wednesday night in the first round of the ACC tournament  a loss that puts the nail in the coffin on the Hokies season PERIOD

While most of spooky seasons special events have come to pass fall is far from over with plenty of fun festivities still in store for Hokies hoping to embrace all the season has to offer PERIOD Southwest Virginia hosts events and has natural beauty for students to enjoy with family friends or

Adequate funding for public education  and lack thereof  has become a leading issue on the political battleground these past few decades PERIOD The rise of the current administration has imposed a greater sense of urgency upon the matter PERIOD Of the  federal agencies that President Trumps proposed budget would eliminate there is one that is of particular concern the National Endowment for the Arts NEA PERIOD

With a current budget of  million the NEA helps fund and promote fine arts programs across the country PERIOD It was originally created as a part of President Lyndon B PERIOD Johnsons Great Society and recently celebrated  years as a standing agency PERIOD However at this rate the NEA may have very little time left to honor this milestone before it is wiped from existence altogether PERIOD

Of course it is no secret that even at the municipal level fine arts programs are among the most vulnerable to budget cuts especially in comparison to STEM and athletics PERIOD Music and art departments in many school districts are under near constant threat of downsizing and outright elimination PERIOD

I suspect that it is easy to trivialize such a pressing concern when were blinded by a veil of what appears to be fiscal pragmatism  when we convince ourselves that math science and football are all that really matter PERIOD These budget cuts may bolster the linings of the governments pockets but doing so comes at a price whose repercussions far exceed politics PERIOD

Research in the behavioral sciences shows the overwhelming benefits of a fine arts education especially in the formative years which are a critical period for brain development PERIOD Eliminating these programs could take a serious toll on the cognitive enrichment and psychological wellbeing of students PERIOD

The field of neuroaesthetics explores how artistic and aesthetic experiences register in the brain PERIOD Ramon y Cajal the legendary theorist who articulated the neuron doctrine drew intricate visuals of the brain that are on display at a Minnesota museum PERIOD This illustrates the unlikely marriage of the sciences and arts and the integral role it plays in development PERIOD

One of the most profound effects that the arts have on the developing brain is increased activity in the prefrontal cortex which is responsible for higherorder thinking and motor skills PERIOD Studies show that students who have received a comprehensive arts education tend to be better at drawing comparisons forming constructive criticism and analyzing alternative viewpoints PERIOD

Artists and instrumentalists in particular show greater development in the prefrontal cortex they acquire very acute fine motor skills as they develop the precision needed to master controlled tasks  for example being able grasp a paintbrush or maneuver the keys of a piano PERIOD

Brain imaging suggests that students trained in the arts also have more activity in the hippocampus a brain structure involved in memory learning and attention PERIOD This may be linked to overall better longterm academic performance compared to their nonartistically involved peers PERIOD

Artists and musicians also tend to be more skilled at spatialtemporal reasoning which is the ability to understand the relationship between objects in space and time PERIOD This can be seen in the correlation between musical ability and math skills it also corroborates the correlational evidence between fine arts education and higher math scores on standardized tests PERIOD

Another interesting finding is the relationship between the fine arts and language development in young children PERIOD Music art and language share common biological substrates as a matter of fact making art or simply talking about it can foster language skills PERIOD Much like with math skills this might play a part in the correlation between fine arts immersion and higher verbal scores PERIOD

Furthermore cognitive neuroscience research show that fine arts have a lasting impact on emotional and social development PERIOD They affect the limbic system of the brain which is involved in emotional processing and houses the rewards center PERIOD People who are learned in the arts tend to have better communication skills especially in measures of cooperation and empathy PERIOD

All of these structural and functional changes occur because of a phenomenon called neuroplasticity PERIOD This is the brains ability to reorganize synaptic connections of neurons in response to learning and experience PERIOD It is important to note that such changes take place during what we call critical periods these are periods of development in which the effects of experience are especially strong PERIOD

Early and intensive training molds the brain causing it to undergo these extraordinary changes PERIOD However the formative years dont last forever  you might have heard the expression use it or lose it. this is why it is essential that children are exposed to the arts starting in elementary school PERIOD If they are not given the chance to harness and cultivate their artistic skills they may never be able to fully benefit from them PERIOD

If the science is lost on you consider a more humanistic perspective elective courses are often the only thing keeping students in school PERIOD Some students have a need for cognition others a longing for expression PERIOD While there are those who thrive in the classroom there are just as many who better flourish in a studio the intellectual gratification that one student may achieve with projects and essays another gleans only through paintbrush and canvas PERIOD

Schools need fine arts programs PERIOD After all lack of opportunity is perhaps the worst predicament that can be imposed on a person because it so often leads to unfulfilled potential PERIOD And while students from more affluent families may have every chance in the world to visit art museums or take private music lessons the average household cannot afford such luxuries PERIOD A fine arts education within the public school medium is the best chance these kids have PERIOD

If such programs are cut students of the middle and working classes may never get to experience the simple joy that comes from successfully playing a scale on a new instrument or completing a piece of pottery and finally getting to paint it PERIOD They may never have the chance to nurture their capabilities and the world may miss out on the next Mozart or Matisse which is a pretty sad waste of talent PERIOD

Throughout human history the arts have been a welcome escape from the mundane inanities of our day to day lives PERIOD They detract  if only for a few moments  from the romantic woes the financial troubles possibly even the odd existential crisis PERIOD We as people have always turned to music and art to drown our sorrows but also to exalt in our happiness PERIOD It really is a beautiful thing PERIOD

And sure a cellist is not going to cure cancer with a wellarticulated cadenza the hole in the ozone layer certainly wont be filled with the stroke of a paintbrush PERIOD But the purpose of music and art is not to solve such problems PERIOD Rather it is to provide us with both an outlet for creativity and a haven of solace to count on in troubling times PERIOD The fine arts are vital to our physical and mental wellbeing and we must do everything in our power to preserve them PERIOD
