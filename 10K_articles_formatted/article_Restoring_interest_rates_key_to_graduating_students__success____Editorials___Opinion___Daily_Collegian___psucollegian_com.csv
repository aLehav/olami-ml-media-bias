554,1970-01-01,"college students are facing a large problem  and many dont even seem to realize it PERIOD

Mere days ago the federal government moved to double federal student loan interest rates raising the current percentage of . to . an interest rate comparable to that of a home mortgage PERIOD

Though this change wont affect any loans taken out prior to Monday the rates will affect all students looking for federal help in the next year and beyond PERIOD

Many are banking on Congress pledge to restore former interest rates following the July  holiday but if the promise cant be kept students are going to be in for a real financial issue PERIOD

Every year talk of raising interest rates occurs over the summer and for the past few years the rates have remained relatively the same PERIOD

Even though students know this impending problem is going to happen most write it off too assuming it wont be a real issue for them until after graduation when many of the interest rates kick in PERIOD

But with the job market still recovering from the recession and the price of higher education increasing every year students cant afford to pay any more after graduation than they already are PERIOD

According to American Student Assistance the average college graduate owes more than  after four years in school and the number continues to grow each year PERIOD

Doubling the interest rate is not only going to make it harder for students to pay back their loans but its going to increase the pressure students already face to find a job and find one fast PERIOD

While we understand the decision will help the government earn more money on loans its unfair to push the economic problems currently facing the government on the future of this generation PERIOD

Upping the student loan interest rate is also going to push students away from receiving federal financial aid as the increase puts a government loan close or on par with that of a privately owned bank PERIOD And those deals arent that great either PERIOD

Government leaders need to step up and listen to the needs of students PERIOD However theyre going to need some assistance PERIOD

Its time for students to stop sitting back and waiting for announcements like these that will affect their future even if the outcome seems far away PERIOD Graduation will come much faster than anticipated and the bills will be higher than anyone imagined especially if the interest rates stay this high PERIOD

Students need to reach out to local legislators and let their voices be heard not only for those facing one more year of schooling but for those that face four or more for the high schoolers that might not even know about this issue PERIOD

If students want lower interest rates its time to speak up PERIOD
