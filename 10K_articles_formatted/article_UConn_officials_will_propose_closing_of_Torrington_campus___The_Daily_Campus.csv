University of Connecticut officials will recommend closing the Torrington campus at Wednesdays meeting of the board of trustees academic affairs committee according to university spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz PERIOD

The committee will have the option of forwarding the recommendation to the full board of trustees which will have the opportunity to discuss the closure of the branch at its April  meeting PERIOD

The rationale for this difficult decision is based on the combination of significantly reduced financial resources and Torringtons declining enrollment Provost Mun Choi said in an email to UConn Torrington students faculty and staff PERIOD

There are currently only  fulltime students enrolled at Torringtons campus Choi said PERIOD Undergraduate enrollment has decreased by . percent since  and the number of potential applicants from northern Connecticut schools dropped almost eight percent since  according to Reitz PERIOD A third of the branchs students take courses at other UConn campuses or at another institution PERIOD

The insufficient student enrollment at the campus  which reflects regional demographics  prevents it from offering the range and quality of academic programs and student services the university provides on all of its other campuses Reitz said PERIOD

University officials are committed to the maintenance of the Agricultural Extension facility and programs in Torrington and will provide academic advising and counseling to all current UConn Torrington students about next steps for their degree completion according to the provost PERIOD There will also be meetings for students faculty and staff in the coming weeks to provide additional information about the possible transition PERIOD

In the event the proposal to close the Torrington campus is approved by the board of trustees we will communicate that to you immediately and accommodate all enrolled students at other regional campus locations and advise students of all of their options in a timely manner Choi said PERIOD

The academic affairs committee meeting is on Wednesday March  at  a.m PERIOD No decision will be made regarding the official closing of the Torrington campus during this meeting PERIOD
