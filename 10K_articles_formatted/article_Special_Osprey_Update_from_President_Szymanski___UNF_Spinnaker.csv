 days into President David Szymanskis run at UNF he has stated that he has felt energized by an outpouring of support by faculty staff students alums and donors PERIOD In theFriday June 22Osprey Update Syzmanski prefaceshis main message with only positive things about UNF and its community PERIOD

However Szymanksis main part of the update is to share that UNF will not be moving up on the Florida Board of Governors  performancebased metrics PERIOD He stated he does not anticipate being above the bottom three universities PERIOD

Although everyone worked to excel on these measures several factors including changes in State Legislaturemandated criteria Florida Board of Governors scoring formulae one dataentry error in Tallahassee and importantly our inability to sufficiently improve final performance on several of the measures have led to a readjustment in expectations as to our anticipated ranking Szymanski said PERIOD

Szymanski also makes it clear that although this is disappointing he is proud of the many programs and initiatives UNF has in place to attract and retain students as well as to help them in their future careers PERIOD

According to Szymanski the states  metrics are important toUNF because they focus on accountability and UNFs maingoalto provide a phenomenal educational experience for our students at a great value PERIOD

As the new President of the University of North Florida I take this goal seriously and will work with administrators faculty students and the entire staff across campus to bring further excellence to our programs that will be demonstrated in our overall total score Szymanski said.As we create and follow new paths to excellence I am strongly committed to enhancing the educational opportunities we offer our students. for more information or news tips or if you see an error in this story or have any compliments or concerns contactemailprotected PERIOD
