Two members of the activist group Refuse Fascism were arrested for unlawful entry by the Georgetown University Police Department while demonstrating in Red Square on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

Two activists Luna Hernandez and Bo Login entered Georgetown Universitys campus alongside fellow members of Refuse Fascism an organization that advocates for the removal of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence through nonviolent protest PERIOD Hernandez and Login were passing out flyers and speaking to students midafternoon Tuesday about the ongoing presidential impeachment trial and an upcoming related protest PERIOD

GUPD officers asked the pair to stop distributing flyers on campus so they decided to relocate to Red Square which they heard was a free speech zone to talk to students about their upcoming event without handing out flyers according to Hernandez PERIOD

GUPD officers arrived in Red Square and instructed the pair to leave PERIOD After the two activists refused to leave officers handcuffed Login PERIOD He then began shouting drawing passing students attention according to video taken by The Hoya PERIOD

Your police came and attacked us and threw us on these benches Login said according to video taken by The Hoya PERIOD We came on this university and we were having casual conversations with people about getting organized and driving out the TrumpPence regime this Wednesday at the Capitol and your police came and arrested us. after restraining and handcuffing Login the authorities pushed and arrested Hernandez she said PERIOD

They whipped me around they knocked me to the ground they pushed me to the ground and I started yelling in pain because it was painful because he started putting his knee in my back and another police officer came on top of me Hernandez said in an interview with The Hoya PERIOD I was like Youre hurting me Youre hurting me I was trying to get up and even when I was trying to get up they yanked me off the ground and they hurt my arm even more. once Login and Hernandez were removed from Red Square Hernadez then told GUPD officers that she could not feel her hand because the handcuffs were cutting off circulation to her hand she said in an interview with The Hoya PERIOD The officers loosened the handcuffs and then took her and Login into custody where they were held for about three hours according to Hernandez PERIOD

Any member from the Georgetown community may protest as long as the speakers and listeners rights to free speech are not violated according to a university spokesperson PERIOD NonGeorgetown affiliated visitors that have not been invited to protest however are not allowed to do so on Georgetown property PERIOD

In this instance as nonstudents the protestors were informed that they could continue to protest outside of the front gates or elsewhere offcampus the spokesperson wrotesaid in an email to The Hoya PERIOD When they refused they were removed from campus by GUPD and arrested for unlawful entry. the GUPD crime log writes that an unauthorized protester was located in Red Square at  p.m PERIOD after they had been previously escorted off campus with the case closing in arrest PERIOD The log separately lists that an authorized protestor was located in Leo J PERIOD ODonovan Dining Hall at  p.m PERIOD after they had been previously escorted off campus with the subjects being barred from campus PERIOD

GUPD has not responded to The Hoyas request for comment at the time of print PERIOD

Although the GUPD crime log says that Hernandez and Login were escorted off campus before their arrest Raphael Kadaris a representative from the D.C PERIOD team of Refuse Fascism said that they were never instructed to leave before their arrest PERIOD

They were not protesting they were inviting students to a protest this Wednesday at the Capitol Kadaris wrote in an email to The Hoya PERIOD They were never actually told they had to leave before they were arrested PERIOD They had been told they couldnt pass out flyers which they stopped doing. the incident was unsettling to watch according to Leo Rassieur COL  a Georgetown University Student Association Senator who witnessed the event PERIOD

I saw a police officer grab her wrist then she yelled and was pushed to the ground PERIOD She was recording the arrest of the other protestor Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya PERIOD

People and groups not affiliated with the university are barred from flyering on campus according to the universitys Speech and Expression Policy PERIOD Only members of the academic community are allowed to hang posters or hand out handbills or pamphlets the policy reads PERIOD

Open discourse is authorized in specific locations on campus including Red Square according to the policy PERIOD The policy does not specify if people outside the Georgetown community are welcome in those spaced without an invitation those spaces PERIOD

Certain areas of campus shall be considered public squares and shall be available without prior arrangement for individuals and groups during daylight hours for the purpose of exchanging ideas the policy reads PERIOD

Login and Hernandez were arrested despite complying with university policy according to a Refuse Fascism twitter thread chronicling the events of Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

Georgetowns core mission states it is a university with a heart dedicated to social justice and restless inquiry the tweet said PERIOD Yet they brutally arrested activists engaged in nonviolent speech simply inviting students to protest a white supremacist fascist regime

Despite the previous days events members of Refuse Fascism including Hernandez and Login returned to campus Jan PERIOD  PERIOD Hernandez said Georgetown should apologize to her and Login and provide the pair a chance to speak about their experience PERIOD

I think the university should give us an apology Hernandez said PERIOD That was unacceptable that they violently arrested us I think that there should be students and professors inviting us to their classes to talk about what actually happened. bill says

The campus needs to be a place where students faculty and employees all feel safe PERIOD  If they have not been invited someone cannot just decide they want to be on campus for whatever reason PERIOD  We all remember the University of Virginia protestors who also were not students and not invited PERIOD  And the fact that these intruders had been asked multiple times simply to relocate outside the gates made them even more unpredictable and possibly threatening PERIOD Add on top of that after their arrest they returned the following day claiming to be asking for an apology  this simply sounds like stalking PERIOD Dude GU is just not into you PERIOD You just come on too strong and dont follow the rules PERIOD  I am sure you have good intentions but this relationship is not going to work out PERIOD Dont make it awkward or embarrassing for either side PERIOD GU just has other people with whom they want to partner on these very same issues PERIOD I know you think if GU could only get to know you then they would definitely want to be at least friends maybe more  but you dont respect boundaries PERIOD And no means no PERIOD So as a parent of a student I appreciate that GU Police responded to the situation appropriately PERIOD
