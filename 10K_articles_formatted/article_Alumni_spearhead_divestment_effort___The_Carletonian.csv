To pressure the College to divest from fossil fuel companies Divest Carleton a network of alumni are collecting signatures and working with students and faculty to gather support for divestment PERIOD

Last week Brett Smith  a member of Divest Carletons leadership team presented to the Carleton Responsible Investment Committee CRIC a group that makes recommendations to the Board of Trustees on the Colleges investments PERIOD

In a handout Smith stated that approximately . million or . percent of Carletons endowment is directly held in the top  fossil fuel companies PERIOD Divestment from Carletons direct holdings would entail selling nine stocks PERIOD

However  percent of the endowment is in commingled funds and the specifics of these holdings are not public PERIOD Divestment from these would be more difficult PERIOD

Through his presentation Smith wanted to show that divestment of fossil fuel stocks would not be complicated or likely to affect the endowment. the alumni have no plans to go to the Board of Trustees at the next meeting which is in February PERIOD Instead they plan to support CRIC and the Climate Justice Coalition a student group for divestment in their efforts to further divestment PERIOD Kate Olney a parent who runs the Divest Carleton Facebook page said she thinks that alumni along with students and faculty make their official ask for divestment before the end of the school year PERIOD

For the September Board of Trustees meeting Divest Carleton sent the trustees a letter asking them to freeze the Colleges new investments in the top  fossi fuel companies and to divest within five years from direct ownership and comingled funds that include these  companies PERIOD Fourteen people signed the letter PERIOD They never received a response PERIOD

A major effort of Divest Carleton is to gather signatures in support of divestment PERIOD Smith and others in the group have tabled at reunions gath ering hundreds of signatures PERIOD

Alumni are an important constituency of the College and there are lots of talented and committed people in this group Smith said PERIOD The College needs to pay attention to its alums PERIOD This is one of the things that Carleton prides itself on. likewise Olney said Alumni are the folks with the money PERIOD Theyve left school and are working and in a position to donate to their alma mater. carolyn Ham  a member of the Divest Carleton leadership team sees the petitions as important in generating awareness and support PERIOD

It generates discussion about the issue of the morality of investing in fossil fuels on campus she said PERIOD

It proves people who are frustrated with the lack of action by our government with a concrete step that they can push for real change PERIOD It also signals to the College that there are large numbers of people who are concerned with the Colleges continued investment in an industry that appears determined to extract fossil fuels despite the certain suffering it will cause to the planet. ham sees divestment as a powerful political tool PERIOD In her first year at Carleton she participated in protests to get Carleton to divest from South Africa due to Apartheid PERIOD She recognizes like divesting from South Africa divesting from fossil fuels will be a longbut necessaryprocess PERIOD Climate change is the defining issue of our time she said PERIOD We must act quickly and decisively to cut our greenhouse gas emissions PERIOD
