The Cincinnati Bearcats beat the Miami University Redhawks  in the Battle for The Victory Bell football game at Paycor Stadium on Saturday September   PERIOD The Bearcats are currently No PERIOD  in The American Athletic Conference PERIOD

Six games down and six to go the University of Cincinnati UC football team sits tied atop the American Athletic Conference AAC and boasts a record of  PERIOD A bye last week gave the Bearcats some muchneeded rest after three key Bearcats went down in the2824 win over South Florida last Saturday PERIOD

Although wide receivers Chris Scott and Jadon Thompson were able to come back it was not the same story for quarterback Ben Bryant PERIOD The fifthyear Bearcat left the game early in the fourth quarter after a hit to the head while attempting to slide PERIOD

With backtoback road trips slated on the schedule the bye week also gives Luke Fickell a chance to do some inner scouting PERIOD Despite the week one loss the Bearcats still have a realistic shot at returning to a New Years Six Bowl game PERIOD After future Big  member BYU lost to Notre Dame its second loss of the season the path became clearer PERIOD

The Bearcats six remaining games are as follows at Southern Methodist SMU  at Central Florida UCF  Navy  at home East Carolina  at home at Temple  and Tulane  at home PERIOD

At the beginning of the seasonwe predicted these two next gameswould be the gauntlet of the schedule and its looking to be just that PERIOD Despite a  record the SMU offense could give the Bearcats secondary fits as the Mustangs average the second most yards per game in the AAC PERIOD

A trip to the FBC Mortgage Stadium also known as the Bounce House will close out October and will likely be the decider of where the conference championship game is held PERIOD The UCF Knights are a muchimproved team from a year before and will certainly be looking for revenge after last years blowout PERIOD

A home game against Navy will test Cincinnatis patience and depth with the triple option but the Bearcats will prevail for another victory PERIOD Closing out their homestand against veteran lead East Carolina will give the Bearcats plenty of confidence for their final road trip of the season PERIOD

A road win against Temple at Lincoln Financial Field will mark the ninth win of the season before returning home to face Tulane PERIOD The Green Wave bolsters the conferences top defense only allowing . yards per game and  points through six games PERIOD However the Bearcats talent and depth are too strong and Cincinnati will find themselves back in AAC Championship PERIOD

Going undefeated through the conference slate will mean the championship will return to Nippert Stadium for the last time PERIOD Despite the Bearcats struggles against dualthreat quarterbacks this season Cincinnati will come out victorious over the Knights once again PERIOD

An  season will put the Bearcats back in a New Years Six Bowl for the third straight year as they look to win their firstbowl game since  PERIOD
