As I walked into The Spanish Moon on Saturday night the chemistry and amplitude of the Young Rivals musical sound struck me like a whiff of fresh air PERIOD

While certainly carrying a familiar indierock sound in recognition of peers and past innovators Rivals seemed more in control and aware than many of their peers PERIOD The choruseffected guitar was lush but not consuming while the bass and drums werent too low or too high in the mix which helped Aron DAlesios voice become near instrumental PERIOD

Lyrics were lost to the rhythm and crowd full of first time listeners but the uplifting current of each song was more than necessary to carry to completion PERIOD

I specifically enjoyed the vibrancy of Interior Light which is reminiscent of all the good elements of 2000s rock but has a lack of nostalgia for that time simply paraphrasing that energy for effect PERIOD

As Born Ruffians hit the floor girls started freaking out to the main acts sound PERIOD

The combined energy from both parties was en masse songs were played straight and narrow but pushed compassion through the room PERIOD Most verses and choruses were easy going decipherable and poppy  good sounds for the twentysomething crowd either in love or falling out of it PERIOD

Each song was snappy and felt springloaded with crystal clear dynamics readily accessible for passing interest or obsession PERIOD

We made It is an excellent example of simple pop temerity PERIOD Luke Lalonde sings One day Im gonna make it fake it till you make it with a phrasing that sparks determinism in the listeners heart PERIOD

Like magic the band settled down into a brand new slow song during the encore and ended on a faster number because it sat better with the crowd PERIOD

Overall the concert was a mixture of wellplayed rock and roll and good vibes from its audience PERIOD
