Some clouds PERIOD Low 54F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Cal State Fullerton Titans are nearing the fifth week of the fall semester but many students still havent purchased required textbooks PERIOD After all the costs  with bonus features CDs and new editions unused by virtually all students and professors  steadily increase every year PERIOD

As of right now according to the Government Accountability Office American students in fouryear public colleges pay about  per year for books and other materials PERIOD And as most have already recognized big businesses will continue to rob us of whatever money we make between classes and extracurricular activities PERIOD

So knowing all this why do so many students stupidly wait until the last moment to get their required readings

Instead of complaining about high costs evil publishing companies and long lines at Titan Shops or Little Professor Book Center the Daily Titan suggests taking some initiative PERIOD

Book listings for CSUF classes are available on the schools Web site so take advantage of living in a society obsessed with technology PERIOD By taking some time to compare prices at Titan Shops  which also has a Web site  and online specialty stores like Amazon Abebooks or Half students can easily save money PERIOD

In addition the Daily Titan reported in its back to school issue about SwitchTextbooks.com a new ingenious site created to cater to broke college students PERIOD With a small annual fee of about  students switch textbooks and acquire points based on books sent and received PERIOD

Even our own university has begun taking more steps to curb the problem of rising textbook costs PERIOD

Titan Shops just started a program  already used around the Midwest  allowing CSUF students to rent specific textbooks and save up to  percent PERIOD Of course the program is still very limited currently the only courses in its program are Chemistry  and Marketing  PERIOD But the bookstore is thinking of expanding aid PERIOD

Some critics argue about identity theft PERIOD Obviously there never is any definite security  even with safeguards by sites such as Amazon PERIOD But online shopping is rising with good reason PERIOD If students choose to be smart and safe consumers by only going on credible sites and changing passwords every month any fear is rather unwarranted PERIOD

It looks as though everyone is contributing to the solution even professors who opt to use more handouts older editions of hardbacks or paperbacks which are easier to sell PERIOD

Everything in Calif PERIOD is getting more expensive nowadays with gas about  a gallon and even movie tickets costing a pretty penny PERIOD But for every problem there lies a solution  and the cost of textbooks is a nonissue considering all the choices we have to save money PERIOD

Lazy students however are a different story PERIOD
