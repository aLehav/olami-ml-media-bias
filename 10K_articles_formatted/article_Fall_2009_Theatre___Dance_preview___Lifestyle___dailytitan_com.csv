Who among those reading this article would like to see what would happen if Snoopy from Charles Schultzs comic strip Peanuts were to die of rabies leaving the rest of the Peanuts gang to deal with their sexual frustration eating disorders and budding drug and alcohol abuse

I see I only have some of you PERIOD What about if four incredibly prestigious and wealthy couples were to have a dinner party only to find that the host has accidentally shot himself in the earlobe causing deafness hilarity and the deep desire of the politicallyaffiliated guests to keep their name out of the paper How about if a schoolteacher from Mississippi runs from her sexually deviant past by her sister and her sisters verbally and physically abusive husband All of this and much more has been happening only footsteps away from your biology classroom PERIOD

The awardwinning Cal State Fullerton Department of Theater and Dance has begun its fall season headlining with Tony Awardwinning musicals and plays such as Neil Simons Rumors a riproaring comedy about what would happen if the host of a very posh dinner party were to go missing with only the gunshot from his bedroom to tell the story PERIOD

Opening next in CSUFs nearby Grand Central Theatre in Santa Ana are two oneact plays PERIOD Woody Allens critically acclaimed God will have a backtoback run with Andrea Greens For Tiger Lilies Out of Season. woody Allens God spoofs the business of acting writing directing and even being a human being PERIOD The nonsequitur show often steps outside its realm of reality to talk to the audience and the improvisational skills of this cast will make this a show no one should want to miss PERIOD For Tiger Lilies Out of Season follows a woman recently diagnosed with a malignant breast tumor PERIOD The show follows her courage as she experiences the reality of cancer PERIOD These two incredibly contrasting shows will make for a very entertaining and eyeopening night at the theater PERIOD The night of oneact plays begins Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Next on the roster is Anton Chekhovs Ivanov a stunning Russian classic about the brilliant Nikolai Ivanov whose dying wife has caused him to question his friends around him and the world he lives in PERIOD

For me the show is about insecurity said senior BFA acting student Andrew Campbell PERIOD Its a play about characters that put on a front and many of them have a jaded view of reality. the show also features veteran actress Svetlana EfremovaReed an acting professional who regularly teaches acting classes in Los Angeles and heads the acting classes of the more advanced students PERIOD The show is the only one of the season to take place in the Hallberg Theatre the most intimate of CSUFs four theaters PERIOD Ivanov opens on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

A brandnew guest director Jon Lawrence Rivera has been brought in to direct this years main stage musical the Tony Awardwinning Miss Saigon. the show follows the tale of a Vietnamese bar girl who falls in love with an American GI in the heat of a wartorn 1970s Saigon PERIOD

I really want this musical to be seen as much more than singing and dancing PERIOD It affects me really personally and I would love for the audience for one night to see the journey of these characters and to really experience what it was like in the 70s during the war said senior musical theater BFA student Jacqueline Nguyen PERIOD Im really excited though because I get to play my dream role. acclaimed and emotionally staggering this musical is not one to miss PERIOD Miss Saigon will be in the Little Theatre on campus and begins on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

The next show to hit our Grand Central Theatre in Santa Ana is the hilarious Musical of Musicals The Musical which spoofs the tradition of musical theater with five very stylized acts which imitate every major musical composer from Rodgers and Hammerstein to Stephen Sondheim PERIOD

Each act has one very relatable theme in common not being able to pay rent PERIOD Any fan of musical theater or even those who enjoyed the film adaptations of Chicago and Sweeney Todd will be in stitches by the end PERIOD Musical of Musicals The Musical will begin its run on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

The Pulitzer Prizewinning A Streetcar Named Desire will follow Rumors in the Young Theatre in midNovember PERIOD A show that has been called one of the greatest stories in American theater by critics around the world A Streetcar Named Desire follows the tale of disgraced southern bell English teacher Blanche Du Bois to her sisters apartment in New Orleans PERIOD

Blanche has just been thrown into this world said grad student Brian Rickel referring to the gritty world of postwar New Orleans PERIOD

Nikolai Ivanov portrayed by Ben Lambert left is in deep thought about his dying wife while Sasha played by Hannah Parsons professes her love to him in Anton Checkovs Ivanov opening Oct PERIOD  in Cal State Fullerton intimate Hallberg Theatre PERIOD Photo by James Bean PERIOD

The closing show for this falls Grand Central Theatre season is the quaintly titled Dog Sees God Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead directed by the awardwinning Patrick Pearson PERIOD Fans of Charles Schultzs Peanuts may recognize the characters as very similar to those in the comic strip but the clever renaming of the characters has helped this play survive a possible copyright infringement PERIOD

Dog Sees God begins with the funeral of CB Charlie Browns beloved dog PERIOD Themes of budding homosexuality marijuana use and paternal abuse run rampant in this sometimes serious sometimes hilarious play PERIOD Dog Sees God begins its run on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

Finally the fall season ends with a bang as the Fall Dance Theatre begins to wrap up the semester of drama and comedy PERIOD With a theme of the most precious and frail moments of life the Fall Dance Theatre promises to be the best datenight in southern California PERIOD The Fall Dance Theatre will begin on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

This falls season of theater and dance holds two distinct advantages over other forms of entertainment the first being that it is much cheaper than a movie PERIOD The average movie ticket costs between . to . depending on the movie and theater PERIOD The second advantage is a very simple one performances at the theater are truly more memorable PERIOD

I can remember distinctly every show I have seen live and most movies I have seen form into a giant blur in my head PERIOD There is something about watching the living breathing people making the story unfold before my eyes that tops cinema in every way possible PERIOD Tickets can be purchased at the boxoffice near the Nutwood Parking Structure or on www.tickets.com PERIOD
