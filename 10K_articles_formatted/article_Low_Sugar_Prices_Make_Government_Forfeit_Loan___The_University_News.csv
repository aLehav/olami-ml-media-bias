3628,2018-10-10,"wASHINGTON D.C.Care for some sugar The government has plenty on hand now that processors have turned over nearly a million tons rather than try to sell it themselves at a loss PERIOD

The sugar was held as collateral under federal pricesupport loans PERIOD Processors are allowed to forfeit the sugar rather than repay the loans when domestic prices fall below the loans value as they have this year PERIOD

The Agriculture Department said Wednesday that more than  tons worth  million were forfeited to the government this week PERIOD Another  tons were surrendered earlier PERIOD

Since the early 1980s USDA has avoided forfeitures by keeping imports low enough to stabilize domestic prices but prices have been driven down this year because of big increases in U.S PERIOD production and other factors PERIOD

Storing the sugar will cost taxpayers more than  million a month PERIOD But the government could recover the cost of the sugar by waiting for prices to rise and then selling it said Jack Roney chief economist for the American Sugar Alliance PERIOD

It would enable USDA to not only dispose of the sugar but also enable them to make a profit on the entire transaction he said PERIOD
