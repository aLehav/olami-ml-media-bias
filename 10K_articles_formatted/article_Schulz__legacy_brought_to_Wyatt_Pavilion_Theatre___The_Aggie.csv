Charlie Brown Snoopy Sally Woodstock Shroeder Linus and Lucy  do these names revive a feeling of childhood nostalgia Starting tonight Studio  will be giving everyone the chance to revisit those days by performing Youre a Good Man Charlie Brown at the Wyatt Pavilion Theater on Old Davis Road PERIOD

The student theatre company will perform a series of musical vignettes best described as a day in the life of Charlie Brown starring sophomore theater and communication major Matt Escarcega PERIOD

Playing Charlie Brown is only intimidating because he is such a lovable character that everyone grew up with Escarcega said who also does publicity for Studio  PERIOD I want to make sure that I embody the character bring it to life and make it as true as possible PERIOD

Studio  is a registered SPAC organization but behaves like a fullscale production company said president Joe Ferreira a senior dramatic arts major PERIOD

Studio  conducts itself as a club with elected officials planned events fundraising and weekly meetings PERIOD They hold open auditions for the productions that may include people outside of the organization and even nonstudents PERIOD

According to their mission statement Studio  provides an opportunity for handson artistic and administrative experience while supplementing the education of creative art students in a

professional respectful and safe environment PERIOD

Each year members of the club propose productions to put on for the upcoming year PERIOD After a vote one or two productions are chosen PERIOD Director and senior dramatic arts major Stephanie Wilcox proposed the idea for this years musical PERIOD

I felt that one of the greatest advantages of Youre a Good Man Charlie Brown is its simplicity Wilcox said which was great for a group of students working on a budget and learning how to mount a fullstage production PERIOD

There are  cast members  orchestra players and approximately  members of the production team collaborating to make the musical come to life PERIOD Working without the help of a faculty adviser has required tremendous amounts of teamwork and dedication from all people involved with the production PERIOD Monetary support has come from fundraising and the revenue from ticket sales PERIOD

We had the freedom to explore many areas without feeling overwhelmed by the text or story Wilcox said PERIOD

Wilcox said her senior thesis works with exploring the relationship between adolescence and theater which is heavily related to the production she is directing PERIOD

I think that the university can play a huge role in bringing theater not just to the campus but also to the surrounding community and Charlie Brown is a great start PERIOD

This years performance aims toward an audience of all ages and Studio  has made special outreach efforts to students at schools all around Davis PERIOD They will also travel offsite to Families First and Shriners Childrens Hospital in Sacramento to perform PERIOD

The cast and crew of Youre a Good Man Charlie Brown has been rehearsing quite often and a long time coming Ferreira said PERIOD They rehearsed for about five weeks during winter quarter and returned early from spring break to complete construction of the set PERIOD

This year is Studio 301s fourth consecutive season PERIOD Their past productions have included The complete works of Williams Shakespeare Abridged and musicals The Last Five Years Cabaret and Into the Woods PERIOD

I hope that the audience enjoys the show for what it is Escarcega said PERIOD I want them to realize the set we built all the fundraising and hard work all the people put into the show to see what Studio  is PERIOD

Youre a Good Man Charlie Brown opens today at  p.m PERIOD in Wyatt Pavilion Theatre and will be performed through April  PERIOD Tickets are  for students and  for nonstudents and are on sale now at Freeborn Halls ticket office PERIOD For more information go to studio301productions.googlepages.com PERIOD
