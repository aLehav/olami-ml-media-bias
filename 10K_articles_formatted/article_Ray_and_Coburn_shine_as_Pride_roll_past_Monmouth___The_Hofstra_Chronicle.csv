The Hofstra mens basketball team had a strong offensive showing against the Monmouth University Hawks Tuesday Dec PERIOD  at the OceanFirst Bank Center as they went on to win  PERIOD The win pushed the Pride over the . mark this season as they now hold a  record PERIOD

Hofstras  points would not have come without key performances from senior guards Jalen Ray and Tareq Coburn who scored  and  points respectively PERIOD Rays point total marked a new career record while Coburn tied his personal record PERIOD

Jalen has a lot more on his plate now with having to play point guard for us said acting head coach Mike Farrelly PERIOD We know that he is an AllConference guard PERIOD He plays like one of the best in our conference and he is one of the reasons why we are going to be able to compete for a championship this year. it was a close game at halftime as the two teams traded the lead many times in the first half PERIOD The Pride would go into the locker room up by two over the Hawks leading  PERIOD The Prides offense really sparked in the second half with a  run that increased their chance of victory in the late going PERIOD

The Hawks would not go away easily PERIOD Senior guard George Papas had a dominating performance connecting on nine threepointers and tying a 30year old threepoint record for the school PERIOD In total Papas scored  points with three assists shooting over  percent from the field PERIOD

That dude has zero fear said Farrelly PERIOD Hes an awesome shooter who has unlimited range PERIOD When we came into this game our goal was to limit the amount of catchandshoot threes that Papas would get PERIOD We did a poor job in stopping him tonight. while the game was Hofstras fifth of the season it was only Monmouths first PERIOD This game between the Pride and the Hawks was originally supposed to be played on Nov PERIOD  but it was rescheduled due to a COVID19 outbreak within Monmouths team PERIOD Although the Pride had

an advantage in experience thus far this season it was difficult for Farrelly and the Prides coaching staff to put together a game plan to go against a team who hasnt played all season PERIOD

It was definitely hard to prepare against a team who hasnt played yet this year Farrelly laughed PERIOD We had to use all our information that we had from them last year Coach Speedy Claxton and our staff did a great job with our scout team to get us ready PERIOD We told the guys that they would play fast PERIOD When the plays we had worked on that Monmouth used last year broke down it was all about being able to guard and getting the stops defensively. the Pride will look to take their winning momentum to the Reilly Center on Saturday Dec PERIOD  when they face the St PERIOD Bonaventure University Bonnies at  p.m PERIOD
