Reedies who frequent the library for solitude and silence may need to make an adjustment this spring semester PERIOD Beginning winter break of  the library is facing some major changes PERIOD While the majority of the building is sound the south wing extending towards Woodstock Boulevard was built with unreinforced masonry which could potentially be dangerous in the event of an earthquake PERIOD However this construction work allows for an exciting opportunity to remodel and upgrade the south wing PERIOD

One thing that we always get requests for in the library are a few more group study rooms where people can go to chat said Reed College Libraria Dena Hutto PERIOD So well have additional group study rooms on the lower and second levels of this new area. the renovation will also involve the addition of compact shelving singleuser allgender bathrooms on all four levels and the conversion of the south wings third floor into academic space with a  student classroom new faculty offices and a breakroom PERIOD

The construction company doing the library renovation Riemers  Jolivette is closely familiar with Reeds campus PERIOD

Riemers  Jolivette is affectionately known as RJ around campus They have done work at Reed for around forty years said Director of Facilities Services Steve Yeadon PERIOD They did the dining hall renovation the Cross Canyon renovations four years ago and they built the Spanish house. admittedly there is something ironic about a library going through noisy construction work but fortunately the most disruptive part of the process should be completed over winter break PERIOD During that part of the project they are going to bring new steel beams in to support the structure and do a lot of drilling so there will likely be a lot of vibration and loud noise during that time Hutto said PERIOD

Usually a large project like this one would be broken up into phases and completed over a period of years PERIOD But because of the nature of the work required that wont be possible in this case PERIOD Its going to be a particularly interesting project for us because we try not to do this sort of big work in occupied space Yeadon said PERIOD We are going to do our best to work around the programming and the needs of the people using the building. when the renovation was first being planned in the spring of  there were a number of focus groups and discussions with students PERIOD Then the project got pushed off until spring of  for financial reasons PERIOD Not surprisingly the unforeseen events of spring  resulted in more project delays so the start date was pushed back again to winter of  PERIOD

Unfortunately a lot of the students we talked to about this back in  have already graduated so now theres a new group of students who are hearing about this for the first time and we really dont have the luxury of spending time to redo those focus groups at this point Hutto said PERIOD

A majority of the senior thesis desks are located in the south wing of the library and those spaces will be unavailable during construction PERIOD One of the ideas that came out of the focus groups was to have three thesis zones which will be areas that are for the seniors but arent assigned it will be sort of first come first served Hutto said PERIOD In a normal year there are  seats with desks in the library and about  of those would usually get assigned to seniors PERIOD But this year there will be  seats with desks and  of them will be in a thesis zone PERIOD Seniors can use these spots when they need to but when they arent there another senior can come in and use that same spot PERIOD

The project should take about a year and will hopefully be completed by winter break of  PERIOD

Its going to be an interesting space for students to use while the renovation is happening but it really is important work to do for the safety of the building and everyone who uses it so were really excited to get this done Yeadon said PERIOD

Im sorry that the same students who lived through pandemic Reed have to go through this but we will try to make it as painless as possible Hutto said PERIOD And if students have ideas about how to make it more painless as we go along I am certainly open to talking about that.",Library Renovations to Begin Over Winter Break â€“ Quest.,Reed College
