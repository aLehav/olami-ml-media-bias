Professional bisexual Robyn Ochs visited the University on Tuesday to discuss the topic of bisexuality in our culture today PERIOD

Ochs who has been bisexual for  years focused on many different aspects of sexuality discussing the research of Alfred Kinsey Fritz Klein and Michael Storms PERIOD

Someone who may only date women but may find men attractive may label themselves as bisexual PERIOD The problem is that certain stigmas are associated with the labels and in a society where its hard to get past stereotypes its important to recognize that these labels dont have setinstone definitions Eric Nuber  said PERIOD

Kinsey has developed a scale known as the Kinsey scale which rates homosexual and heterosexual tendencies on a scale ranging from  to  PERIOD On the scale a  is considered exclusively heterosexual while a  is exclusively homosexual PERIOD

Ochs referenced this scale throughout her speech and built her own exercise that involved the audience PERIOD On the back of a paper Ochs asked each audience member to rate himself or herself using the scale PERIOD The paper contained various questions such as Where would you put yourself on this scale taking into account your romanticemotional attractions

After the audience completed this survey the surveys were collected and shuffled then passed back out to each of the members of the audience PERIOD Ochs then randomly selected members to come to the front of the room to represent the anonymous paper they had received PERIOD Once the members arranged in order on the scale according to the overall sexual orientation number that was on the paper Ochs asked the people to state which label such as gay or straight was on the paper PERIOD

I think presentations like this especially in todays society where sexual issues have come to the forefront of public attention are extremely important PERIOD People need to realize that sexuality is not a cutanddry issue but a more fluid construct PERIOD I truly believe that talking about these issues will help people understand different sexual identities Nuber said PERIOD

After completing this exercise it was found that the labels varied across the scale and were not always dependent on location PERIOD

At the end of her speech Ochs asked students to state what they learned from the session PERIOD Many students cited the need to be more openminded and some even stated that they better understood the meaning of sexuality including bisexuality PERIOD
