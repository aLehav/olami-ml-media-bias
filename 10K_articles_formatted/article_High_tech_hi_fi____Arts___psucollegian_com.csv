Will the new generation of computers kill the classic record store

One of the nicest things about payday is that after the bills are paid there is a little extra cash left over for a longawaited ecstatic shopping spree PERIOD Its time to cut loose and go a little crazy PERIOD Its time to do some music shopping PERIOD

But after waiting in line at the bank the next stop is not necessarily the local music store PERIOD Instead it may be a trip straight home to the computer to log on the Internet and browse through the various online music retailers PERIOD

Here a music enthusiast can check out advertisements for new stuff read a few artist biographies and maybe even download a few tracks to listen to before deciding what to buy PERIOD

Then when the decision is made all it takes is a click on the  icon and within days the selection will arrive on the doorstep to be listened to and cherished PERIOD

This may sound like a futuristic ad for a telephone company but it may also be the new age of rock n roll retail PERIOD An age when one can read magazines get concert tickets and see street maps to concert venues  all through a computer PERIOD

  

Several companies such as Geffen Records CDNow and SonicNet have already invested in this vision of the future making parts of it a reality right now PERIOD

Roy Hamm one of the directors of Geffens online projects said the effects of online retail are currently minimal but the concept has high potential PERIOD

 Hamm said PERIOD 

But Hamm said it will not alter the function of music stores PERIOD

 Hamm said PERIOD

Jason Olim founder and owner of CDNow an online music superstore does not agree PERIOD Describing what CDNow provides as  he says that interest is shifting away from retail stores PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

The changes Olim forsees however are not as revolutionary or allencompassing as one might think PERIOD

 he said PERIOD Olim said the record label will not disappear as many people may expect because the label is still a bands chief source of profit PERIOD

 Olim said explaining that labels will not be as dependant on distributors as they once were PERIOD

Record companies are also having an easier time discovering new bands to sign on their labels because they do not have to work as hard Olim said mentioning IUMA a company in Indiana that brings material from unsigned bands online and connects them with record labels PERIOD

Another anticipated revolution Olim mentioned but said will probably not be seen in the near future is that of  This concept entails the use of  CDs and CDROM equipment PERIOD

A CDROM is like a CD player in that it reads digital information off a disc but it is hooked up to a computer PERIOD The CDROM allows the computer to use a CD like it would a computer disc but the CD has a much vaster storage space and can hold anything from sound and text to moving images PERIOD

Through the Internet a user can download an entire album directly from the record companies onto a blank CD PERIOD Essentially downloading means a customer can copy a song off an online service onto their computers through the modem a phone line connected to the computer PERIOD

Although this type of technology will not be available for years Olim named Digital Cable Radio as another kind that is an immediate threat to all corners of the music industry PERIOD It is a radio service that  he said PERIOD

Despite the many new developments Olim does not expect the change to music distribution through the Internet to be dramatic but rather a gradual shift to the new outlets PERIOD

 Olim said PERIOD

As far as the local community is concerned area music stores are intrepid about the present and upcoming changes to the music industry PERIOD

 said Ken Kubala manager of City Lights Records  E PERIOD College Ave PERIOD 

Jay Williams assistant manager at Blue Train Compact Discs  E PERIOD College Ave said he does not think consumers are ready for the technology yet because they do not have the equpment or the knowledge PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

Local music consumers have mixed feelings especially regarding the convenience of learning to use the systems PERIOD

 said Angela Warner sophomorehuman development and family studies PERIOD

Mark Dubrovnick of Emmitsburg Md. does not agree PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

Regarding the online services being used on a widespread level he added 

  

 Olim said boasting CDNows large stock PERIOD

The system also provides the All Music Guide  Olim said PERIOD

There are discussion groups in which people confer about musical topics online in real time just like a telephone conversation via the computer PERIOD There are also artists pages which provide graphics bios discographies and sound samples Olim said PERIOD The feedback option takes consumers opinions and remarks and sends them back to the AU Music Guide he said PERIOD

 Olim said PERIOD

CDNow is also connected directly with Internet sites of major record labels including Geffens World Wide Web Warner Bros. JazzOnLine Bellfast and the soontobeadded MCA Records Olim said PERIOD

Internet users can transfer directly from these sites to CDNow if they find a title in the inventory of the record company which they wish to purchase he said PERIOD CDNow claims to provide all available music to or from anywhere in the world Olim said PERIOD

 Olim said PERIOD 

Merchandise is purchased with credit cards and delivered within two to three days he said PERIOD

  

In contrast to CDNow SonicNet is a much smaller more specialized online music service PERIOD It has a program called Action Ready Singles said Judith Keenan director of marketing and promotion PERIOD This a service allows signed and unsigned bands to put up any number of songs to be downloaded PERIOD

The bands set a fee of one to three dollars that the listener has to pay to hear the song but SonicNet receives no profit from this fee Keenan said PERIOD All proceeds are returned to the artist who posted the song PERIOD

 Keenan said PERIOD

Aerosmith through a Geffen project made material available online in this manner with a download time that was  to  minutes  a duration allowing for highquality CD sound PERIOD

But it was costly for people to remain online so long because the modem sends and receives information by telephone lines so the user pays for the time as if it were a phone call Keenan said PERIOD For example this means that a  minute downloading of a song from a Californiabased music service would cost the same as a  minute phone call to the same area PERIOD

SonicNet shortened the downloading time to about twice the length of the song but this produces sound only as good as FM radio PERIOD

 she said PERIOD

For a  monthly fee SonicNet provides a number of services in addition to Action Ready Singles PERIOD  is a service in which Alternative Press reviewer Jim Santo lists and profiles his favorite demos PERIOD

SonicNet also runs a couple of New York clubs as venues for shows booked and produced by SonicNet she said PERIOD

One of the largestscale tours SonicNet has handled was a God Street Wine tour that SonicNet provided ticket sales for on a nationwide level PERIOD

Keenan said the idea has been successful because people can get tickets well before a show PERIOD

However as for as largescale arena tours go Keenan said online services in general have not reached the point that they can be an alternative to Ticketmasters alleged monopoly PERIOD
