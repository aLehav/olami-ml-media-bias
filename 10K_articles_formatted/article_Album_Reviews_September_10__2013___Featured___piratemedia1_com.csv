Grade 

John Mayer

Album Paradise Valley

Released Aug PERIOD 

Paradise Valley the sixth studio album from John Mayer is very much an extension of his  release Born and Raised continuing his musical narrative through time PERIOD Its hard to say whether or not Mayer has evolved through these last two albums but he has undeniably chosen to venture into a new genre entirely PERIOD Paradise Valley illustrates the fusion of Mayers traditional sound with a new southern feel PERIOD

Mayer molds acoustic and electric guitar simple drum lines and of course his crisp and boisterous vocals PERIOD The album lacks complexity and fails to step out of Mayers comfort zone making it overly structured at times PERIOD However theres a collection of illustrious country rock tunes that really concentrate on the lyrics and vocals for what they are  pure and moving PERIOD Wildfire is Mayers most defining country rock ballad that merges catchy instrumentals with playful lyrics PERIOD Dear Marie is a simple acoustically carried song portraying Mayers feelings towards his high school love PERIOD

Writers Picks

Half Moon Run

Album Dark Eyes

Released July 

Ominously tranquil is the best way to label the debut studio album from Canadian indie rock group Half Moon Run PERIOD Resonating minor chords and echoed vocals is the foundation behind most of the tracks on this album PERIOD Half Moon Run incorporates a complex range of instruments from synthesizers to strings that make for one of the most complete indie rock albums I have heard this year PERIOD Songs one to  were meticulously shaped and crafted making every song worth a listen PERIOD

Full Circle the debut single thats appeared in video game trailers as well as the Canadian rockalternative chart is a timpani driven folk tune in which Devon Portielje and Dylan Phillips sing harmoniously together PERIOD Need It is a slower piece concentrating primarily on Portieljes vocal ability and range PERIOD Dark Eyes is an excellent beginning for a band with a bright future PERIOD

Forest Swords

Album Engravings

Released Aug PERIOD 

Its time to venture into the cryptic world of English experimental electronic music to recognize one of the most outstanding artists of the year respectively PERIOD Matthew Barnes who received rave reviews for his debut EP Dagger Paths in  has released his first studio album titled Engravings. the album is inventive intriguing and unlike anything released in the electronic music industry this year PERIOD Engravings features a wide range of orchestral and tribal instruments all consolidated into  fourplus minute long tracks PERIOD

Barnes music was created to evoke feelings and draw reactions from those who listen PERIOD The Weight of Gold is an organic piece that uses a variety of highpitched guitar riffs over ominous autotune chants PERIOD The track is like a painting layered with contrasting sounds to give a full product PERIOD The Plumes follows a very similar formula PERIOD While the album is categorized as electronic it has a very tangible feel PERIOD
