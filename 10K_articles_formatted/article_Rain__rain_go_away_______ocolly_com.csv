These Cowboys dont even have a roof over their heads PERIOD



Oklahoma State coach James Wadleys tennis team lacks what most other teams around the country call essentials PERIOD



Wadley has coached the team for  seasons without indoor courts PERIOD



Lacking such courts makes OSUs practices different from others in the nation PERIOD It changes the teams schedule and budget PERIOD



In January and February the Cowboys travel to Tulsa or Oklahoma City six nights a week to practice indoors PERIOD



Wadley said they usually get the courts at  p.m PERIOD but sometimes its later pushing the teams return to midnight or later PERIOD



 he said PERIOD



Despite the extra time spent driving each practice Wadley said he and the team are counting their blessings PERIOD



 he said PERIOD 



Part of that  comes from the students schedules which can burden their schoolwork but they manage the arrangements Wadley said PERIOD



 he said PERIOD 



Despite obstacles and strains on the players study schedules their GPAs havent suffered significantly Wadley said PERIOD



 he said PERIOD 



Senior Daniel Byrnes said the latenight practices take a small toll on his classes but their difficulties also give the Cowboys an edge over opponents PERIOD



 he said PERIOD 



Nearby opponents such as Tulsa Oklahoma and Baylor have or are building indoor courts PERIOD



While the Cowboys are postponing practices and matches because of rain cold or wind most other schools are continuing practice hidden from the elements PERIOD



Byrnes of Melbourne Australia said indoor courts give other players an advantage the Cowboys dont have PERIOD



 he said PERIOD But indoors you havent got any factors PERIOD I think going indoors is a little easier than coming outdoors every day.We kinda use it as a chip on our shoulder Were gonna beat those rich kids that have everythingthose rich kids.I think what drew me to OSU was just the tradition the people whove been here beforeCoach Wadleys been here 30odd years I knew he had a good program so it was an easy decision.I think were the only team in the Big  who uses cardboard scoreboards nowTheres a lot of wants like that but basically in tennis you need a court and rackets and string and anything else is just a luxury item but wed like to have the luxuries too like the other teams haveWeve been fortunateWeve been able to recruit some good kids and theyve worked hard and weve avoided injuries PERIOD







Wadley said having indoor courts would make it possible for the Cowboys to be regular contenders in the top  or national championships PERIOD



That possibility will be put to the test when a 15million tennis complex will be built as part of OSUs Athletic Village PERIOD The courts are scheduled to be completed in  PERIOD



Wadley said the project will include at least six indoor courts with training rooms meeting rooms and it is hoped coaches offices PERIOD



 he said PERIOD 



Although he said he is grateful for the promised courts Wadley said he wished this teams players had them PERIOD



 he said PERIOD 



Wadley said having to travel to practice indoors is the thing players dislike most about OSUs tennis program PERIOD



 he said PERIOD



Despite knowing he wont get to use the future complex as a Cowboy Byrnes said he is excited for his schools opportunity PERIOD



 he said PERIOD I just think its a good thing PERIOD
