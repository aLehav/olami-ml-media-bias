The universal translator from Star Trek the babelfish from The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and a real human interpreter are a few of the things to which the Skype Translator has been compared PERIOD Released to a limited amount of users in December as a prototype it provides instant audio translation between English and Spanish and text translation between over  other languages according to Skypes Big Blog PERIOD Microsofts newly released technology could become an invaluable tool for eliminating language loss recording the worlds  languages and bringing them to a more equal sociopolitical level PERIOD

Out of the  languages currently spoken around the globe one dies every other week PERIOD Languages spoken by only a few dozen or a few hundred people are quickly losing their relevance in the globalized world PERIOD Linguists cannot record languages fast enough nor realistically protect them but a computer learning a language using input from the speakers could keep that language alive PERIOD

The wonder of the Skype Translator is that the computer program learns PERIOD

Say you teach Skype Translator English  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at the inaugural Code Conference last May PERIOD It learns English PERIOD Then you teach it Mandarin PERIOD It learns Mandarin but it becomes better at English PERIOD And then you teach it Spanish PERIOD It gets good at Spanish but it gets great at both Mandarin and Englishand quite frankly none of us know exactly why. this ability is called deep learning one of two processes the Skype Translator uses to distinguish itself from other technologies like Google Translate which is generally recognized to be inadequate PERIOD

It is more sophisticated than previous technologies in that the user can correct the computer by rewriting any mistakes in the text feature of the translator PERIOD This means that if the computer hears a fake ton instead of affection for example the speaker can type in what she actually said allowing the computer to expand its repertoire of phonetic nuances PERIOD As a result of both of these features the program should become smarter the more it is used potentially becoming fluent in human speech PERIOD

Following Nadellas statement the technology that runs the translator could become advanced enough to record any language PERIOD Minority languages like Native American Nahuatl would then have a database to keep them from becoming lost even in the absence of human speakers PERIOD

Moreover instant translation could eliminate the prejudice that certain languages like English Spanish or Chinese are more useful than others PERIOD The universality of English forces business people around the world to learn it PERIOD Similarly people in India learn Hindi in order to move to major cities PERIOD Instant translation offers the possibility for people to become engaged in the globalized world while still using their native language PERIOD If governing bodies or businesses could conduct meetings in a myriad of languages international cooperation would be infinitely more simple and efficient PERIOD

Language domination forces students learning English as a second language in U.S PERIOD classrooms to fend for themselves in Englishonly classrooms PERIOD Instant translation could break the communication barrier between students and teachers who do not share a language PERIOD

It doesnt eliminate the need to learn new languages Professor of education Suzie Abajian said PERIOD It could be used to highlight key words and get general concepts. occidental students travel the world to conduct research and learn about international cooperation PERIOD Technology like the Skype Translator in its future incarnations would allow them to visit more places and dive even deeper into the cultures they encounter PERIOD
