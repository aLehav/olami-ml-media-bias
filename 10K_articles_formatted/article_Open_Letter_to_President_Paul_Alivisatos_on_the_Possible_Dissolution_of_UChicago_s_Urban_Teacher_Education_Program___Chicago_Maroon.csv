2201,2022-03-16,"educators students and alumni of the Urban Teacher Education Program UTEP at UChicago call upon the University to reconsider disinvestment in teacher preparation PERIOD

By University of Chicago Urban Teacher Education ProgramNovember  

Dear Dr PERIOD Alivisatos

We are educators current students and alumni of the University of Chicagos Urban Teacher Education Program UTEP PERIOD We are writing to voice our strong disappointment at the possible dissolution of the teacher education program that has made a profound impact on our personal and professional growth as teachers and the larger landscape of teacher education in Chicago and beyond PERIOD

Since its inception in  UTEP has graduated nearly  educators who work at over  public private and charter schools across Chicago and other cities such as Boston and Los Angeles PERIOD In its recent Illinois Education Preparation Profile scorecard from the Illinois State Board of Education UTEP exemplary designation overall and on multiple indicators including the number of diverse graduates of the program demonstrated teaching skill retention and placement of graduates in highneeds schools PERIOD

The program has a unique design by Dr PERIOD Kavita Kapadia Matsko Dr PERIOD Marv Hoffman and Dr PERIOD Anthony Bryk past director of the Urban Education Institute PERIOD In the first year of the program cohorts of students engage in classes to examine their own identities participate in fieldwork to gain understanding of local school contexts and tutor students as they learn literacy development PERIOD In their second year or residency year students are placed in two different classrooms and school communities to learn from experienced teachers create and implement curriculum and build relationships with students PERIOD In addition graduates are provided with individual coaching for the first three years of their careers which is a critical time for more support PERIOD

Graduates of UTEP are passionate thoughtful and resilient PERIOD They are advocates for their students and school communities PERIOD They are committed teachers in it for the long haul many of whom become mentor teachers for UTEP or instructional leaders within their schools PERIOD They are recipients of Golden Apple awards Teacher of the Year awards and other accolades PERIOD They become school coaches and administrators nonprofit leaders Ph.D PERIOD candidates activists within their local school communities and writers who document their experience as teachers PERIOD UTEP alumni are committed to being the change by envisioning and working towards a more equitable education system PERIOD

The University of Chicago prides itself on supporting K12 education in Chicago through its investment in communitybased initiatives and programs including urban education PERIOD Disinvesting from teacher preparation a fundamental piece of the education system would be a huge loss to the overall work that the University is doing to transform education PERIOD At a time when there are many policies leading to the nationwide teacher shortage and devaluing of the profession cutting off an important pipeline for wellprepared teachers in Chicago is unwise PERIOD In addition the Universitys possible withdrawal of leadership within teacher education spaces and from the deep connection within communities that UTEP has developed seems antithetical to its goals of more fully engaging and partnering with the surrounding communities and city PERIOD

We request that you commit to a series of conversations with alumni and current and former UTEP staff about the future of UTEP PERIOD We hope that the University decides to invest in UTEP through financial resources and staffing required to maintain the graduatelevel courses and programs in place and eventually grow the program PERIOD We also believe the University can support UTEPs marketing and recruiting efforts to nurture diverse cohorts of future teachers in Chicago PERIOD

We thank you for your consideration and look forward to your response PERIOD
