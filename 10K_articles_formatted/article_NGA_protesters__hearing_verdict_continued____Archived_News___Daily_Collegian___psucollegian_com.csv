After a fourhour hearing yesterday the students who protested at the Osmond Building in July are closer to getting a decision about whether Penn State will formally punish them PERIOD

They wont get a verdict for another week at the earliest PERIOD The hearing started late and exceeded its time limit PERIOD The rest of it is scheduled to begin at  a.m PERIOD Thursday PERIOD

The three students  Justin Leto Robyn Stephens and Michelle Yates  are all charged with violating university rules PERIOD The university has accused them of failing to follow police orders to leave a balcony during a demonstration against the National Governors Association Annual Meeting on July  PERIOD

The students said they were allowed to be on the balcony and the police violated their First Amendment right to hold a peaceful demonstration PERIOD

Police arrested the students in July but criminal charges against them were dismissed several days later PERIOD

Their universitys charges against them are not serious enough to warrant a full review board of Judicial Affairs officers PERIOD Instead one trained judicial affairs volunteer is in charge of the hearing which is the students final level of appeal PERIOD

The most severe punishment the students could face is probation Penn State spokesman Bill Mahon said Wednesday PERIOD

The hearing officer Housing and Food Services Director Fred Fotis said yesterday that he wanted to hear witnesses on the side of the students before he made his decision PERIOD

Before the hearing about  students and faculty signed a petition insisting that they be let into the hearing PERIOD

Judicial Affairs officials told them the hearing room was too small to accommodate them all and declined to move it to another room PERIOD

The hearing was only open to the students academic advisers and five observers including a Daily Collegian reporter the students invited PERIOD

Since July the students have been sharing details of their case with the news media PERIOD

Only a few new items came out of the hearing which dealt mostly with the procedure of applying to hang a sign on the Osmond Building PERIOD

Leto continued to say that he and the protesters had permission as well as a constitutional right to demonstrate at the building on July  PERIOD

But two university witnesses said Letos application to hang a banner on the building was never cleared by the university PERIOD The form was rejected they said in part because Leto tried to reserve space all over the campus to accommodate  demonstrators PERIOD On top of that Leto only filled out the form to include dates through July  the witnesses said PERIOD

The students meanwhile continued to challenge the fairness of the court at times objecting when they were unable to ask questions they wanted witnesses to answer PERIOD

As time began to run out Fotis limited the students to talking only about their specific charges PERIOD

As they have in the past the three students said law enforcement officials were spying on them during the NGA meeting reading their emails and trying to silence their opinions PERIOD
