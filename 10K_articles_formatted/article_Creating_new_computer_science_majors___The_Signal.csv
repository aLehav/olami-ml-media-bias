8826,2023-11-05,"two new degree programs are making their way to Georgia State PERIOD The Admissions and Standards Committee approved major eligibility requirements for Bachelor of Science degrees in data science and game development PERIOD

On Jan PERIOD  the Student Government Association held their first universitywide meeting of the semester where Sen PERIOD John Le Student Services Committee chair announced the committees progress PERIOD

The Academic and Standards Committee are pretty much over everything that happens in the academic catalog or approving new programs Sen PERIOD Le said PERIOD

ShellyAnn Williams director of the College of Arts and Sciences presented the degrees according to Le PERIOD

Both new degree proposals will be coming out of the Creative Media Industries Institute PERIOD

Theyre still under review in the Board of Regents David Cheshier director for Academic Programs at the Creative Media Industries Institute said PERIOD

Major eligibility requirements for both degree programs are similar to the requirements for a bachelors degree in computer science in the undergraduate course catalog PERIOD Students must have a . gPA across three course areas A B and C meaning they must receive a grade of C or higher in each course PERIOD

The bachelors in data science requires Principles of Program for Data Science I DSCI  for Area A PERIOD The bachelors degree in game development requires Programming for Games I CMIS  PERIOD

Area B gives students the choice to take either Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science CSC  or Discrete Mathematics MATH  PERIOD

Area C offers Precalculus MATH  Calculus of One Variable I MATH  Calculus of One Variable II MATH  or Multivariate Calculus MATH  to meet the area requirement PERIOD

The GPA requirement for the course areas are based on a firstattempt basis PERIOD

Withdrawal failings count as an attempt but regular withdrawals before the withdrawal period ends do not count as an attempt PERIOD The university Repeat to Replace policy courses are not counted as first attempts PERIOD

People that transfer into Georgia State that want to go into the bachelors in data science program can use the grades from their transferred courses into GPA calculations or they can attempt them once here Le said PERIOD

Attempts taken at Perimeter College count as first attempts as well PERIOD

I asked the committee about making an academic pathway from an Associate in Science in data science at Perimeter and then transition here for a bachelors degree Le said PERIOD They said at the moment theyre planning on just having students  take computer science courses at Perimeter College instead of data science and then when they come here their courses can just replace data science requirements. according to Le the actual courses for each degree program havent been created yet PERIOD

The degree programs use a different programming language that students must learn to progress in each course PERIOD Computer science uses Java data science uses Python and game development mainly use C and C PERIOD

Currently there is an existing degree program where students can earn a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree in game design and development PERIOD

From what I can discern from this whole conversation with the committee was that they want to separate the game design and development Le said PERIOD Because game development is so coding heavy if you take into account data science and computer science requirements it requires a lot of math because it is a computational science. the list of optional courses for the bachelors degree in game design and development are so wideranging that a student could potentially avoid or ignore the coding side of the degree PERIOD The degree program has the makeup of two degrees in the form of one but the game development side of the program doesnt have a math requirement PERIOD

My assumption is that they want to actually separate the game development side from it so that it can include the math requirements so that people wont just go straight into coding and get lost or go into system levels programming or any of the really rigorous computer science courses and then just get lost Le said PERIOD

The bachelors in game design and development will remain the same PERIOD The bachelors degree in game development is just an additional degree program that gives students more options and a better focus on the coding side of games with better preparation for the math needed to excel in the program PERIOD

I think they just want to add a math requirement to it because it has to have the same rigor as if youre taking data science or computer science Le said PERIOD They want to give more options while also keeping that math rigor because it is very computational overall. the Bachelor of Business Administration degree in computer information systems has also become an option for students interested in computer information to combine technical skills and business skills PERIOD

A lot of the main reasons why they put these kinds of major eligibility requirements for computer science is because a lot of people if they dont go into computer science theyll try to hop into the computer information systems track over on the business side if they dont do that then theres really not much of a choice Le said PERIOD

The computer information systems degree program requires students to take Introduction to Programming CIS  PERIOD According to Le that course can be replaced by Principles of Programming I CSC  for students that either took a programming class early or changed their major from computer science to computer information systems PERIOD

There is also already a Master of Science in data science and analytics in the J PERIOD Mack Robinson College of Business PERIOD

The thing about data science is that its a very quickly growing field because now youre having a lot of people that know how to do all of the technical stuff Le said PERIOD But they dont have the skills to actually relay that to terms that people can easily understand and data science closes that gap between those. the growing need for data science in the business field has introduced the desire to develop a degree program specifically for it according to Le PERIOD
