4136,2014-10-23,"its time for Americans to stop supporting the wholesale of American firepower to the battlefields of the world PERIOD Since  and perhaps before every time American weaponry is poured into a region where there is in unrest open conflict or civil war the conflict worsens more civilians are killed and more refugees created all the while major defense companies and contractors line their pockets with taxpayer money from a country that is already over  trillion in debt PERIOD The results of this flawed foreign policy have never been clearer to see than it is now with the crisis involving the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ISIS which is largely a result of this policy of flooding the Middle East with American weaponry PERIOD

With tens of billions of dollars of military aid and weapons sales to virtually every nation in the region save for Iran its no surprise that ISIS has ended up with billions of dollars of American military hardware including hundreds of Humvees and highpowered artillery as reported by Business Insider PERIOD ISIS was able to acquire all these big guns and armored vehicles with ease when the Iraqi army who we spent tens of billions to train and equip during the last decade turned tail and fled leaving huge stocks of armaments undefended PERIOD Iraqi officials admitted to the Guardian that  Iraqi troops fled in the face of just  ISIS militants who then proceeded to capture Mosul Iraqs second largest city PERIOD The Obama administration and Republicans alike have decided the appropriate action is to provide new American weapons to the Iraqi army to fight ISIS  new American weapons paid for by U.S PERIOD taxpayers PERIOD Starting to see the paradox

Now we have a heavily armed radical militant group brandishing U.S PERIOD weapons controlling territory in Iraq and Syria thats rampaging through towns committing atrocities and threatening the very existence of the country of Iraq PERIOD So how do we respond to this threat By supplying more weapons to more groups of militants of course PERIOD The Obama administration has reacted by also supplying increased amounts of weaponry to the Iraqi government the Kurds in northern Iraq who are actually seeking independence and more recently to the loose coalition of citizen soldiers that identify themselves as the Free Syrian Army FSA to the tune of  million dollars of guaranteed support to the FSA alone PERIOD The FSA Iraqi government the Kurds ISIS and the Syrian government under the dictator Bashar alAssad all have different interests and are essentially each on a separate side in this Mesopotamian shit show in which we have entrenched ourselves PERIOD

So here we have a civil war spanning two countries with no less than five distinguishable separate factions four of which are now armed or being armed with heavy American weaponry while the U.S PERIOD stirs the pot further using its own arsenal to directly bomb targets in Iraq and more recently Syria PERIOD A popular weapon used against ISIS is the Tomahawk Cruise Missile with a hefty . million price tag per item PERIOD The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments reports that nearly a billion has been spent by the U.S PERIOD in the campaign against ISIS as of Sept PERIOD  with much of that money going to weapons manufacturers that provide the ordinance PERIOD Its also noteworthy to mention that many of the popular media figures promoting U.S PERIOD intervention against ISIS on CNN Fox News and MSNBC actually receive money from many of the defense corporations that stand to profit from U.S PERIOD military action in Iraq and Syria PERIOD

While millions flee Iraq and Syria to neighboring Arab nations that lack the infrastructure or resources to take of them the U.S PERIOD is spending billions of dollars to make sure every side of this conflict has quality made in the U.S.A PERIOD firepower PERIOD The amount of money spent to provide food water and shelter to refugees of this humanitarian disaster continues to be limited due to the amount spent to arm most every faction of the conflict itself PERIOD

Perhaps some questions to ask yourself or your congressman do people still do that would be Will funneling more weaponry into these warzones help the situation or the people suffering from it in any way Why isnt more being done to help refugees Only  Syrian refugees have been allowed into the U.S PERIOD since the civil war started there in  as reported by Vox.com PERIOD And why the fuck are we bombing Iraq AGAIN when weve been bombing the impoverished country for  of last  years with nothing but a shittier situation to show for it and at least a million civilian casualties mostly children according to UNICEF and The Lancet medical journal You likely wont get an honest response if you get any at all but if you were to hear the truth from your representatives it would probably mention the tens of millions in lobbying spent by defense companies Raytheon BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin that ensures there is always an open market for their deadly products PERIOD

Its time to think critically about who stands to gain from the latest round of conflict in the Middle East and reject the usual excuses used to arm groups that will invariably turn on the U.S PERIOD like they have so many times before PERIOD Remember the photo of John McCain posing for a picture with suspected ISIS members two years ago Recall Reagan supporting the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq during the 80s As Albert Einstein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results PERIOD

Ultimately its our responsibility as Americans students or not to think critically about the consequences of our military involvements around the world and who truly benefits and who suffers PERIOD

David Jackson is getting sick of this shit PERIOD

Ive got a novel idea PERIOD Lets do nothing PERIOD Let the Muslims deal with their own problems for a change PERIOD Lets let countries like Saudi Arabia Qatar Kuwait with their endless ocean of money and Westernbought armaments figure it out instead PERIOD Surely they  being practitioners of the religion of compassion and peace  will step right up to the plate in our stead PERIOD OK you caught me there PERIOD You knew I was kidding You knew what I know which is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools PERIOD Whatever we do will be discredited and if we do nothingRead more
