The Cadigan Center for Religious and Spiritual Life RSL moved from the building at  Woodside Ave. located across the street from the Octagon and behind the new Lyceum to the basement of Keefe Campus Center in June PERIOD In turn the offices of Community Living  Housing and Operations Residential Engagement and Wellbeing and Community Safety  have all relocated to  Woodside PERIOD

Dean of Students and Chief Student Affairs Officer Angie TissiGassoway spearheaded the move last year and informed all offices involved late last semester according to RSL Director Harrison Blum PERIOD Members of the office advocated for years to relocate the center onto central campus long before Blum assumed the role of director in  he said PERIOD

Since the move Blum has seen a noticeable increase in the number of facetoface interactions with students PERIOD

Ive run into the same student who I have known and worked with in the past but usually only saw when we made appointments to see each other he said PERIOD Ive seen that person four times in passing in the last week PERIOD My access to students has notably increased. marie Lalor director of Housing and Operations said that her office is adjusting well to the move in a statement PERIOD Until the end of last semester her office was operating out of a oneroom office on the first floor of Keefe PERIOD Despite the relocation Lalor said that the office is welcoming students to our new address with the same regularity that we did when we were located in Keefe Campus Center. lalor said that an initial concern her office had was that they would face a similar issue to RSL  that the peripheral location at  Woodside would make it difficult for students to find it PERIOD

Over our first few months at  Woodside that concern has subsided she said PERIOD We are closer to the heart of campus than it looks nestled between the new Aliki Perroti and Seth Frank Lyceum and Newport House. both Blum and Lalor added that the larger space at  Woodside is better suited to the offices of Community Living than it was to the Center of RSL PERIOD

We have so much more space to both spread out and work more effectively now Lalor said PERIOD We had 5plus professional staff and several student staff working out of  Keefe last spring and it was tight PERIOD We are all settling in with more wiggle room and are making good use of the space at  Woodside. apart from a logistical standpoint Blum hopes that having the Center for RSL centrally located on campus will foster a normalization of faith life as part of a full human experience. sometimes in academic institutions or spaces being faithful is  thought to be in conflict with intellectual rigor he said noting that the college had room to grow in terms of embracing faith life as a part of student wellbeing PERIOD Toward that end Im really pleased that RSL can be more centrally located more impactful.",Religious and Spiritiual Life and Community Living Swap Spaces,Amherst College
