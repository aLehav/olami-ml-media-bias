The Military Times ranked Quinnipiac University as third in the nation for active duty and veteran students in its  Best for Vets ranking PERIOD

The publication surveyed  colleges and universities out of the nearly  colleges and universities in the U.S PERIOD Participant institutions had to volunteer to be a part of the survey and submit answers to  questions on services and resources provided to military students PERIOD

Students were not surveyed as a part of the ranking PERIOD Metrics like GPA completion retention numbers and financial aid provided for military students were taken into consideration PERIOD

Executive Director of Veterans and Military Affairs and Assistant Vice President for Student Experience Jason Burke said that there are just over  student veterans at Quinnipiac two percent of the overall student population PERIOD

I was really surprised about the ranking and I felt really honored to support our student veterans Its really a recognition for them Burke said PERIOD

Student Veteran James Magson a junior political science major said that attending Quinnipiac has been one of his most fulfilling experiences second only to serving in the Marine Corps from  PERIOD

We are all very different and contribute to Quinnipiac in different ways but the veteran community has managed to remain unified through academic collaboration personal mentorship and simply being friends Magson wrote in an email to The Chronicle PERIOD Being a part of this community has strengthened my academic performance and personal life as well. in addition Quinnipiac was ranked first in Connecticut for military students by the Military Times PERIOD Only three Connecticut schools participated in the survey Middlesex Community College one hundred and eighty-fifth overall Goodwin University one hundred and thirty-third overall and Quinnipiac PERIOD There are over  colleges and universities in the state PERIOD

This survey aims to account for the wide spectrum of educational models in our country while prioritizing the baseline experiences of militaryconnected students The Military Times wrote in a release Sept. PERIOD We advise readers that the best fit between an individual student and a school can only be gauged by more specific inquiry into the needs of the student and the institutional character of each school. burke a retired naval officer said that the online and print publication is well known among the military community with subsets the Army Times Navy Times Airforce Times and Marine Corps Times PERIOD

Burke said that he started filling out the lengthy surveys around ten years ago when he began at Quinnipiac and has seen the university score in the top 60s 20s and No PERIOD  but never in the top ten PERIOD

Due to an increase in endowed funds from external donors Burke said that military students are being provided with more scholarship opportunities PERIOD

It really shows that our students are missionfocused and careeroriented too to get their degree and move on and catch up to their peers that went into college right after high school when they went into the military Burke said PERIOD

As veteran and activeduty students do not enter college directly after graduating high school Burke said that there is often added anxiety about going to school with different life experiences than their peers PERIOD

So thats where I come in to help them ease their minds let them concentrate on being students and have me along with the other administrative offices on campus take that administrative burden off of them as much as possible Burke said PERIOD

Joseph Coverly a junior international business and computer information systems double major who served in the navy said that his experience as a student veteran at Quinnipiac has been positive PERIOD

Coming to Quinnipiac with such a large number of vets makes me feel right at home Coverly wrote in an email to The Chronicle PERIOD Its hard to explain but there is a bond between veterans PERIOD Even if we do not know each other we are still family. as the treasurer of the Student Veterans Organization Coverly said that he and other student veterans feel supported by Burke and the Office of Veterans and Military Affairs PERIOD

Veterans Affairs along with the SVO hosts events like the Veterans Day flag raising Veteran State Dinner and fundraiserslike a dodgeball tournament and barbeque cookout to bring the universitys military community together Burke said PERIOD

Quinnipiac welcomes our experience and always thanks us for our service Coverly said PERIOD

Burke said that the average age for veteran and activeduty students at Quinnipiac is around  years old and many military students live in the community rather than on campus and have families of their own PERIOD In addition many military students are the first generation to attend college in their family PERIOD

The military community on campus is about two hundred students that are a myriad of life experiences and ethnicities and religions and they all come together as a group that works hard Burke said PERIOD
