UTA also offers an online certificate in Autism Studies which has a large number of students from Africa participating said Smith PERIOD Working with Ilumno Network we modified our courses for them based on what they think they will need PERIOD Were really optimistic that these courses will be met by a good turnout. in many cases the students who will be taking these certifications will be professionals who are already active in their field Smith said PERIOD Getting a certificate from an American university can help them move up in their careers PERIOD

I think this is great said architecture sophomore David Rodriguez PERIOD By giving people a chance to improve themselves through education especially in the developing world UTA can make an important difference in the quality of life for thousands. johnMCrowley
