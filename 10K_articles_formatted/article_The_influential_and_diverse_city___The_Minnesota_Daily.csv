Published  December  

Some language courses offered at the University reflect the uniqueness of the states cultural demographics PERIOD Languages are brought to the University at the request of academic programs or through popular student and community interest PERIOD Some classes already echo the voices of Twin Cities but languages such as Somali are necessary PERIOD

U.S PERIOD Department of Education Title XI which was initiated during the Cold War to train students in languages provides funding for language programs PERIOD

Vietnamese Hindi Urdu and Hmong which itself is a true reflection of the Twin Cities received grants from Title XI after significant community interest PERIOD Swahili and Somali might be next on the list PERIOD The University initiated work on a Swahili program after students in African American studies expressed disappointment that they were offered studies only in colonial languages either French or Arabic but not a study in a nativeAfrican tongue PERIOD On the other side Turkish found its way here through the history departments request to enhance the scholarship of students concentrating on Ottoman history PERIOD

The University invests in other languages such as Ojibwa Dakota and Korean PERIOD The Korean program here is the third largest in the country PERIOD Popularity for Korean sparked for many reasons the most interesting is the number of Korean adoptees living in Minnesota that desired to explore their roots by studying the language PERIOD

Investments in language courses prove to be an asset for the global world we live in but it also provides a chance for many to reclaim their culture PERIOD For students whose families have been here for decades its difficult for one to retain their language PERIOD Instead of allowing youths who present diverse backgrounds to assimilate completely into mainstream society its worthwhile to invest in language courses PERIOD

The fact that we live in a cosmopolitan society with a significant Somali population here conveys the need for the language PERIOD Many Somalis call Minneapolis home but if Somali American youths cannot pick up the language at home studying Somali at the University ought to be an option PERIOD
