7468,2022-03-19,"bitter temperatures arent ideal for baseball but Ohio   MidAmerican Conferencefound a way to stay warm and split its series with Bowling Green   MAC PERIOD

The Bobcats struggled to fend off the Falcons in game one but shifted the weight in game two PERIOD Both games were highscoring as Friday ended in a  loss and Saturday ended with a  win for Ohio PERIOD

Heres how the weekend went for the Bobcats

Friday

Ohios offense flurried like the snow falling on Warren E PERIOD Steller Field PERIOD It came and went but never stuck PERIOD

Edward Kutt IV did not have his best day on the mound PERIOD He allowed six earned runs and four unearned runs in three and twothirds innings of work PERIOD Kutt managed to strike out five of the  batters he faced but that wasnt enough PERIOD The loss was Kutts briefest stint on the mound this season PERIOD

The Falcons piled onto the Bobcats in the fourth inning PERIOD They scored eight runs to extend the lead from two runs to  PERIOD

Ohio had nowhere to turn at that point PERIOD Its offense couldnt connect and Bowling Greens pitchers were dishing out strikeouts PERIOD Ohio only had three hits Friday and only one came after the fourth inning PERIOD

It didnt help that Bowling Green later beat around relievers Zach Weber and Tyler Peck PERIOD The Falcons got one run off Weber and three off Peck PERIOD The only difference between the two was that Webers run was unearned PERIOD

The game ended in seven innings due to the mercy rule PERIOD Bowling Green got its way with Ohio  and its first conference win of the season PERIOD

Saturday

Ohio had an intense fourth inning of its own on Saturday PERIOD It had the upper hand regardless but its offensive explosion in the fourth inning set up its chance to win via the mercy rule PERIOD

The barrage started with a grand slam by Isaiah Peterson  his second home run of the game  and ended with a threeRBI double by Alex Finney PERIOD

However that was not the only time Ohio had a large influx of runs PERIOD The seventh inning followed a similar pattern PERIOD

The Bobcats picked up a run on a solo home run by Mason Minzey and scored again after a twoRBI single by Will Sturek PERIOD An RBI walk and a sacrifice fly gave the Bobcats what they needed to secure a mercy rule victory PERIOD

Brett Manis got his third win of the season after relieving starter Jacob Tate PERIOD Manis struck out five of the  batters he faced Saturday PERIOD After two innings Manis was pulled in favor of Brenden Roder PERIOD Roder allowed two hits but didnt allow a single run scored in his two innings of work PERIOD Roders performance helped boost his conferenceleading ERA PERIOD

Due to the weather game two Saturday and the final game in the series Sunday were canceled PERIOD
