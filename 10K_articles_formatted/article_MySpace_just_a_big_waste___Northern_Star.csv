Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Genevieve DiesingApril  

If a movie were to be made about the daily interaction of much of todays youth that film would most likely feature a large portion of its subjects huddled over laptops impulsively clicking mouses surfing  you guessed it  MySpace PERIOD

Or perhaps the filmmakers would choose not to focus on that aspect PERIOD After all is spending countless hours staring at a computer screen really that glamorous

MySpace has been banned from computers in schools across the country for reasons ranging from risqu content to the page taking up too much bandwidth on computers but perhaps the most common complaint about the addictive site comes from the users themselves With all the time they put into MySpace the less they have dedicated to facetoface interaction PERIOD

Sometimes it prevents me from talking to people and hanging out with them said graduate art history major Emily Barney  who has been a MySpace member since November  PERIOD I like MySpace because it helps me keep in touch with friends but because of that convenience it really prevents me from spending quality time with them. mySpace Americas fourth most popular Web site with more than  million members has become an international breeding ground for the kind of individualized networking that most young people today would rather be within than without PERIOD The site is credited with revolutionizing access to the independent music scene creating an electronic phenomenon of personal expression and making a large portion of facetoface contact between people a good deal less necessary PERIOD Users can create personal profiles post pictures songs and videos and interact with the sites millions of other users in a variety of ways PERIOD

The problems with the online addictions created by such sites as MySpace are similar to complaints that have circulated around excessive television watching PERIOD Kids instead of getting exercise using their imaginations and socializing the oldfashioned way have spent so much time in front of a screen that they lose opportunities to develop interpersonal skills and the kind of social building blocks that will serve them later in life PERIOD A  Ball State University report shows that the average American spends nine hours a day watching television surfing the Internet or talking on their cell phones PERIOD According to Alexa an Internetranking Web site MySpace is just behind search engines Yahoo Google and MSN in popularity PERIOD This means MySpace is getting a lot of daily attention  perhaps too much PERIOD

At the end of the day after all these hours have been logged many MySpace addicts wonder if they are really any better off spending time on their computer than with their friends themselves PERIOD

No one can deny that young Americans crave convenience that sites such as MySpace provide a service that has been capitalized upon for a reason PERIOD It also goes without saying that the opportunity to connect and socialize so efficiently is something that few of us take for granted PERIOD Yet there is only so much intellectual growth and social linkage that can be gleaned from a computer screen PERIOD Perhaps tearing ourselves away from our addictions a little bit can help us better appreciate the kind of convenience that MySpace represents PERIOD

After all we wouldnt want to be considered anything but glamorous in the event we were featured in a movie PERIOD
