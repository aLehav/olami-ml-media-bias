Recently I lost my nine year old chocolate lab Jade and three months ago I lost my cat Luna PERIOD Grieving both the losses of my beloved animals was and still is a difficult process and is never easy especially when it is unexpected PERIOD Whether or not its expected or unexpected losing a pet can change your life in a lot of ways and it shouldnt be taken lightly PERIOD

Many people rely on their pets for emotional security and often form deeper connections with their pets than with other humans in their life PERIOD Usually they form deeper connections with their pets because of distrust in other human beings trauma from past relationships and because animals can be a kind of therapy PERIOD This might be why we see so many pet therapy and service dogs around PERIOD Animals can greatly help humans heal from physical or emotional trauma can boost their happiness etc PERIOD A study showed that around  percent of therapy dogs had an impact on patients admitted to a hospital or who were waiting for a bed in a hospital PERIOD They then brought in therapy dogs to visit the patients and patients reported experiencing less pain anxiety and depression PERIOD Keeping all of this in mind it makes sense that grieving a pet is just as hard as grieving a human being PERIOD

Dogs may not be able to speak to you or communicate with you like a human being can but they are just as important in a persons life PERIOD Oftentimes adults consider pets their children and care for them just the way they would a child PERIOD Children who grow up with pets often consider them like siblings and truly part of the family PERIOD Without them there there is an absence in the home PERIOD Dogs cats and other pets are so much more than just pets PERIOD They offer an unconditional kind of love that sometimes the people in your life cant PERIOD This is why it is so extremely hard to process the grief that you may feel after losing a pet and trying to figure out why it sometimes may hit harder than losing a person PERIOD

Many may consider grieving a pet not as noteworthy or important as losing a person PERIOD This is where theyd be wrong PERIOD Grieving a pet while not exactly like grieving a person can be quite similar PERIOD The feelings and emotions of losing something or someone that you love is never easy and can feel the same whether you lose a person or a pet PERIOD Something people feel very often when letting a pet go is guilt PERIOD If youve ever had to put your pet down via euthanasia that is a very hard process to go through and the decision to do so is also very difficult PERIOD When dealing with this particular way of losing a pet it has been shown that some pet owners feel guilt and are not sure that they are making the right decision PERIOD Pet euthanasia is known as the merciful and more painless death for a beloved pet and while it is difficult to go through it may be the best option PERIOD Regardless it is not ever easy to see a beloved pet suffering much the way it is difficult to watch a human suffer PERIOD These feelings of guilt may be overpowering and some people may not be able to handle that PERIOD This goes along with the grief PERIOD This is also why the loss of a pet is a bit different than the loss of a person PERIOD

Is this grief something you wont ever be able to overcome No PERIOD Losing a pet may not be something you ever forget or feel better about after years but it is something you can live with PERIOD If youve recently lost a pet like me it might be a good idea to take a day to yourself to process your grief PERIOD After I lose a pet I usually take a day off of school or work to process what I am feeling PERIOD In this time find something that grounds you and something that you find relaxing or enjoyable PERIOD Everyone processes losing a loved one and grief very differently so it is important to remember that how you are feeling is very valid PERIOD Some people feel more outwardly emotional and some people may not PERIOD However you are feeling and processing your grief is valid and no one should take away your experience PERIOD If distracting yourself helps do that but remember that it is okay to reach out to someone you love or someone who understands what you are going through PERIOD Just because you did not lose a person does not mean that you are not allowed to grieve PERIOD

If you feel the need to speak to someone counseling services are available on campus at  PERIOD
