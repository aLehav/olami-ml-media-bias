On Thursday March  Jeremy Koo  a Distributed Energy Resources and Electrification Associate at Cadmus Group spoke with energyinterested students about his unique career pathway to technical consultancy PERIOD The talk which took place in the Science Center was part of the Loeb Center for Career Exploration and Developments  AlumniinResidence Program PERIOD

Koos work at Cadmus an international missiondriven strategic and technical consulting firm dedicated to advancing social good focuses heavily on energy PERIOD In his talk which was lauded by student attendees Koo discussed the value of publicprivate partnerships and the power of a liberal arts education among other topics PERIOD

Koo began the presentation by reminiscing on his days at Amherst as a young scholar PERIOD

Hailing from San Diego Koo came to Amherst in September  with a rough plan to go through  departments in his first two years worth of classes and like any San Diegan a reluctant readiness for Massachusetts notorious snowy winters PERIOD It really started with So what the hell do I want to major in when I got to Amherst said Koo PERIOD One of the attractions of Amherst was the open curriculum he said attributing his wellrounded intellectual growth to the freedom to experiment taking classes from different disciplines PERIOD

The only thing that I really knew that I wanted to do was sing a capella when I got here. koo joined The Zumbyes in his first year and maintained his membership for the rest of his time at Amherst PERIOD

In his senior year Koo declared a double major in music and environmental studies and wrote a thesis in music composition before graduating with a careerchoice question So what the hell do I do with my life

Koo said that after a period working as a graduate assistant in the music department and then an assistant director of Amherst College Choral Society he decided to turn towards his other major environmental studies and applied to be an intern at Massachusetts Clean Energy Center PERIOD

Despite how much I admired my professors I would not say that they really got a bead on where the industry was at that time Koo said PERIOD Nonetheless Koo found that my generalist approach to things and my mindset to learn quickly and adapt to different challenges was extremely useful especially once he moved to intern at Northeast Sustainable Energy Association NESEA in  PERIOD

NESEA was a Greenfield nonprofit working to to help coordinate what had  been a nascent niche group of greenhome builders to slowly develop a field of practitioners. at NESEA he eventually became a coordinator facilitating programs on sustainability and the built environment PERIOD After a search of over  companies within the NESEA network Koo moved to Meister a small Bostonbased consulting firm PERIOD The firm was later acquired by Cadmus Group where Koo has continued to work PERIOD

In  Koo became a senior analyst at Cadmus where he now works as an associate PERIOD

While some consultants are a little bit like management consultants where they work  percent on individual longterm projects Koo is on six to eight projects at the same time and manages about half of them PERIOD

Koo commented on the unpredictability of consulting PERIOD Unfortunately consulting is hardly a 40hourwork week  I usually work around 44ish hours Koo said PERIOD You cant really control clients  Sometimes governments will just decide Hey we need to spend all this money by this date PERIOD Please respond to this request by sending in a 20page bid on why we should hire you to develop a strategy by next week

Koo was also surprised by the amount of writing that he had to undertake as a consultant PERIOD He cites his work on reports client communication and presentations as places where an Amherst education came in handy PERIOD

He credited his time at Amherst for introducing him to the idea of working with the public sector through readings and group discussions from his environmental studies class PERIOD I learned that theres either working for or working with the public sector said Koo PERIOD Governments frequently work with the private sector The government doesnt have staff on hand to be able to install solar Koo said PERIOD Governments lack inhouse technical expertise  As a result most governments fill in these capacities using a public procurement process that brings in private energy consulting firms to perform that work and avoid creating permanent positions. koo assured students that their future hardearned liberal arts degree will have practical applications PERIOD

In delivering his analysis of Amhersts role in preparing him for the professional world Koo stated that while the college did not provide him with tangible subjectmatter knowledge and technical skill sets it exposed him to a wide range of environmental issues and gave him diverse perspectives for approaching problems and developing solutions as well as a reasonable writing ability PERIOD Courses at Amherst that emphasized how to frame and approach complex problems from multidisciplinary perspectives have been most valuable for developing strategic approaches to addressing my client needs Koo said PERIOD

Contemplating the energy and utility consulting services industry in the next five years Koo asserted that climate action is at a critical point PERIOD By  well hit a major milestone for many governments engaged in climate action PERIOD There are unlikely to be magic bullets that solve our problems  only complicated answers to a complicated problem PERIOD However the industry is growing with increasing investment and dependency on public and private sector leadership PERIOD It is certain to me that there are a lot more opportunities to grow within the energy and sustainability space. koo concluded his presentation with words of advice on career paths PERIOD I was super anxious about entering the workforce without a clear career trajectory like other of my friends did PERIOD It took a while for me to finally realize it was okay to not know firsthand what you want to do PERIOD The rest of your life is a long time shared Koo PERIOD It is okay to come out of school and just want to explore and try out different sectors and not feel like you have figured out what path in life you want to stay committed to eventually. koo advised students to not limit themselves into any one particular field too soon PERIOD

In his closing remarks Koo emphasized the importance of finding something that gives us enough joy and hassles that we tolerate enough PERIOD It is great that a job can be your passion said Koo PERIOD But a job can also just be a job. in the QA section Sushan Bharratai  asked How equitable do you think the change in serving renewable energy is

In response Koo explained that Theres a lot of issues right now with equity PERIOD For better or for worse were not as far as where we need to be on the point of global energy. koo cited policy in states such as New York whose recent climate legislation sets aside interest revenue from new energy policy for lowincome communities PERIOD I have been working particularly with policymakers and New York staff since  Koo said The question that theyre asking went from How do we get these technologies to How do we get these technologies into homes so people can afford them The questions are shifting. such an insightful presentation by Jeremy Koo said Micah Owino Program Director for Careers in Government and Nonprofits at the Loeb Center PERIOD He successfully illustrated how public and private partnerships can positively impact society.",Jeremy Koo â€™12 Discusses his Path from Amherst to Sustainability Consulting,Amherst College
