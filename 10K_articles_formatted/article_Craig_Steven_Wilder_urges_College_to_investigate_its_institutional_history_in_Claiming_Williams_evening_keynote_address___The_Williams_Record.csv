Craig Steven Wilder author of this years Williams Reads book Ebony and Ivy Race Slavery and the Troubled History of Americas Universities delivered Claiming Williams Days evening keynote address in a Zoom webinar on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD Wilder is a professor of history at M.I.T PERIOD and a former professor of history and Africana studies at the College. he also serves as a senior fellow at the Bard Prison Initiative a Bard College program that provides college educations to people during their incarcerations in the New York State prison system PERIOD

Wilder answered questions from Professor of Humanities Joy James and audience members about his work investigating institutional histories and how he sees such investigations creating change in American colleges and universities PERIOD

When researching for Ebony and Ivy he realized that the history of universities could help the readers understand the centrality of slavery to American institutions of higher education PERIOD If I could show them that no university none survives colonial America without attaching itself somehow to the slave economy I could help readers understand the centrality of slavery to this era he said PERIOD

After the Revolutionary War American universities experienced a revival Wilder said PERIOD American churches used a resurgent slave economy to institutionalize their presences and their claims upon the new nation raising more than a dozen new denominational colleges in the aftermath of the war including Williams PERIOD North Carolina Georgia and Tennessee founded the nations first public universities he said PERIOD

At the same time communities across New York and New Jersey began establishing private academies that produced students to fill these new universities according to Wilder PERIOD Locally organized selfgoverned and funded by tuition and donations academies allow public officials to expand education without imposing taxes without centralizing authority and without aggravating religious and political schisms he said noting that this system advanced communities that already had significant assets PERIOD

To demonstrate how investigating institutional histories can expand understanding of the history of slavery Wilder used Erasmus Hall Academy in Flatbush a neighborhood in Brooklyn N.Y. as a case study PERIOD Reverend John Livingston and Judge John Vanderbilt  who both came from New York slaveholding families  called the academys founding meeting in February  PERIOD

Flatbush actually had no deep academic traditions to build upon Wilder said PERIOD What it had was slaves PERIOD Virtually all the free families in Flatbush owned someone. a  census which was taken shortly before the first meeting of Erasmuss founders reported that Flatbush was the densest slaveholding community in the state with enslaved people making up over  percent of its population PERIOD

Wilder explained that these statistics and the rise of academies in New York state was no coincidence PERIOD

Merchants and  farmers across Long Island actually found great wealth in supplying the West Indies and the South with the food that they needed in order to run slave plantations and maintain them he said PERIOD And those pockets of wealth actually now supported a transitioning educational economy in the eighteenth century. erasmus Hall Academy is just one example of how academies and colleges belonged to the slave economy and American education was accessed through slavery Wilder said PERIOD There was in fact an educational renaissance in the Dutch midAtlantic but that renaissance could extend only as far as slavery extended PERIOD It could survive only as long as slavery lasted and could enlighten only what slavery had not condemned to darkness. after his talk James served as the moderator for the questionandanswer portion of Wilders talk PERIOD James began by asking him what holding institutions accountable may look like as they begin to reconcile with the connection between slavery and higher education PERIOD

Wilder said that this question served as a source of inspiration for him when working on Ebony and Ivy PERIOD Examining race can actually render things that are known untold PERIOD It can keep the known from being told he said PERIOD

Specifically Williams has a very real legacy with slavery Wilder said which he discusses in Ebony and Ivy PERIOD Williams has a very real legacy with Native American dispossession. wilder said that the erasure of race and slavery from institutional histories was an intentional process PERIOD Universities and colleges actually wrote the history of slavery and they wrote slavery out of their stories he said PERIOD It didnt require a conspiracy PERIOD They didnt have to conspire to erase slavery from the narrative PERIOD It only required a consensus that slavery didnt matter. while institutions of higher education are responsible for this pattern Wilder said they can now be responsible for the solution PERIOD The choice to reconcile with these histories he said rests with the people who are engaged with these institutions right now adding that the work of student activists gives him hope for the future PERIOD

Wilder said that he is particularly inspired by student activists in the movements for colleges and universities to divest from fossil fuels and private prisons and to repair predatory relationships between institutions and their surrounding communities PERIOD

The reason we continue to talk about universities colleges and slavery is not that I wrote a book or that anyone else wrote an article Wilder said PERIOD Its actually that undergraduates on campuses across the United States have forced their institutions to reckon with their histories PERIOD They forced their institutions to live up to the rhetorical claims that we so often make when we invite those students onto our campuses and where they find in fact the shock of being disappointed that that rhetoricis actually in conflict with reality. through investigating institutional histories Wilder said he hopes people will come to realize that those of us who have been kept out of these institutions are in many ways the ones who have the greatest ownership of themwe can be here and actually do good work of justice. charlotte Staudenmayer  is a prospective English and environmental studies major from Amherst Mass PERIOD She was previously a section editor for the news..
