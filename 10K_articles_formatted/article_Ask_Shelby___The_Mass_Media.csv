Now that club activation is complete for the semester all new and returning undergraduate and graduate clubs should have updated contact information on their profile page on SAGroups www.clubs.umb.edu PERIOD In Student Activities one of our goals is to make it as easy as possible for students to become involved and connected with cocurricular opportunities PERIOD If a student contacts a club president and does not hear back then I would encourage them to come to the Student Activities Office Campus Center Room  PERIOD We can connect the student with the club advisor and make sure to get them in touch with a member of the club
