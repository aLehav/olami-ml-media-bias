This past weekend I went undercover into the great outdoors and did some investigative This past weekend I went undercover into the great outdoors and did some investigative journalism PERIOD More specifically I explored the worlds of underage drinking and fishing without a license PERIOD

Several college buddies and I went to our friends cabin in central Pennsylvania for the weekend PERIOD Miles away from civilization and with no phone reception or computers we were disconnected from the world PERIOD It was the type of manliness not normally achieved by suburbanites like myself and after years of wondering I know now what it is to be a man PERIOD

But enough of my ruminating the weekend was a lot of fun PERIOD I am not really accustomed to the worlds of swimming in creeks boating fishing and other nonsense and it showed PERIOD I am responsible for sinking the canoe twice in three minutes and for almost killing myself and several others on a rope swing PERIOD Still I am glad I had several of these neardeath experiences because its the only way Ill learn PERIOD

After our weekend was over and we had cleaned up the empty bottles of beer lying all around the house we began our drive back PERIOD We had turned on the radio to get traffic reports when instead we heard a KYW news report PERIOD The report said that parents need to worry more about children in the summer and that playgrounds are potential death traps PERIOD The woman called it summers of trauma and then proceeded to say that emergency rooms are already filling up with children PERIOD

The report didnt seem to bother my friends very much one of whom was sleeping and another was looking out the car window at several girls but I sat bolt upright in the car seat PERIOD My brain quickly kicked into overtime PERIOD I began to wonder why we coddle children so much in this country PERIOD

I thought it was assumed that children are going to find ways of injuring themselves like the little lemmings they are PERIOD And shouldnt these alleged traumatic summers follow from the fact that in the summertime people are more active spend more time outdoors and therefore are more prone to injury

The biggest complaint I have about the news is the sensational aspect of it and summers of trauma demonstrated that PERIOD In the  seconds that the expert was on the air the good doctor provided no facts no statistics and no analysis PERIOD She delivered her big scary monologue and then the station cut to a commercial PERIOD

Her use of the phrase I can already see the emergency room filling up conjures an image of some civil war site with thousands of injured children lying in a field with hackedoff limbs PERIOD You can hear Battle Hymn of the Republic playing patriotically as Timmy age  who fell off the monkey bars and sprained his wrist is wheeled into the emergency room PERIOD

The news report didnt serve to tell parents anything insightful like avoid the monkey bars after a rain but instead served only to create unnecessary panic PERIOD

The reason for this has to be the stiff competition nowadays for the ratings but I dont think it is the news job necessarily to compete PERIOD But today there is very little a news program can maintain in its journalistic integrity when it is pitted against Cribs and ETrue Hollywood story Lindsey Lohan. half of the news this past week was about Tom Cruise and some thing he did on Oprah. the other half of the news is ways that we are in danger PERIOD If you dont believe me look at the fact that the odds of dying in a shark attack are  million and the news breaks into special coverage and plays the theme music from Jaws every time one happens PERIOD

It is also like the situation of that girl who is missing in Aruba PERIOD This is not to say that the case isnt sad but it is such a sensationalized story that many people will now fear going to the Caribbean PERIOD Some frightened mother somewhere will tell her daughter who is Arubabound after graduation Well I dont know  isnt that whole area a little iffy

Perhaps it will still be a long time before we have CareBear News Show with anchorbear Love E PERIOD Heartsalot PERIOD But I think we need to do better than our current Death Hour with Dr PERIOD Kevorkian PERIOD

We need to expect more from our journalists PERIOD Instead of having what amounts to modernday variety shows as our unimpeachable sources of news and knowledge I hope someday to find a good reliable voice in the midst of TV land someone who can resist the temptation to turn an animal attack into CNN presents Shark Week PERIOD

Sam Morey wants to be a news anchor someday but some say he has a girly voice PERIOD Send mail to emailprotected PERIOD
