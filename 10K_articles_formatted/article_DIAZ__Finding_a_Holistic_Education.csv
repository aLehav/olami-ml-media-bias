As a 15yearold Cuban American who had never set foot outside of the United States my desire to live and learn in the Middle East seemed odd or incomprehensible to most PERIOD I was fascinated by the Arabic language and it was my goal to attend Kings Academy a high school in Jordan where I could live with local and international students alike while studying Arabic PERIOD I was certain that studying in Jordan was not only the best way to deepen my knowledge of the Arabic language but also to grow as a whole person PERIOD

After a year of writing and pleading with hundreds of businesses I was unable to obtain the remaining financial assistance I needed PERIOD With less than a few weeks before classes began I launched  decorated glass bottles into the Atlantic Ocean asking for support PERIOD A local newspaper wrote an article about my story and I was flooded with support the same day PERIOD

The three years I spent at Kings Academy were characterized by the love warmth care and support I received from my classmates and teachers PERIOD My school was guided by a mission to ensure an integrated life for its students an emphasis on global citizenship and diversity and a responsibility to serve our local community PERIOD This environment helped me grow and flourish and I knew that I wanted the same from my college experience PERIOD At Georgetown University I found just that PERIOD Georgetown was guided by similar Jesuit values that above all prized educating the whole person service and community in diversity PERIOD Just as I had in Jordan I knew that I could flourish in such a space PERIOD

Georgetown provided a space to balance my identities and interests PERIOD I turned to groups with similar passions and continued taking classes on Arabic language and Arab history and culture PERIOD I found a home in Arab Society as vice president and through cultural performances as part of Turathuna Georgetowns first ever Dabkeh dance troupe PERIOD

Throughout my time at Georgetown I was presented with countless opportunities to give back to the local community PERIOD My freshman year I participated in the Countering Islamophobia alternative break program and for three years served as a tutor for immigrant youth and adults with the D.C PERIOD Schools Project PERIOD As a daughter of immigrants and having witnessed the Islamophobia within my own community these opportunities to serve and learn formed a meaningful part of my Georgetown experience PERIOD

During my junior year I studied abroad in two distinctly different places Doha Qatar and Jerusalem PERIOD The ability to live and learn in these two locations provided me with a more holistic understanding of the Middle East an opportunity few universities offered PERIOD Even at the end of my time at Georgetown the diversity of coursework permitted me to explore my interest in other languages apart from Arabic PERIOD My senior year I chose to continue with Arabic along with a semester of Hindi and gained proficiency in Italian constantly finding connections among these seemingly unrelated languages and cultures PERIOD Together these experiences permitted me to grow and flourish personally and academically PERIOD Georgetowns commitment to a core set of values echoed what I had most appreciated from my time in Jordan PERIOD

My experience at Georgetown was not without its difficulties but through the love and support of my teachers and family I overcame the doubts fears and challenges I faced along the way PERIOD In Jordan I valued the time my teachers dedicated to mentor and guide me PERIOD Throughout my time at Georgetown I was fortunate to also find teachers that sometimes took hours of their time to impart wisdom provide advice and discuss my interests PERIOD With the love and unwavering support of my family I found strength to overcome my fears and continue to thrive at Georgetown PERIOD As graduation approaches and I go on to pursue a masters degree in Arab studies at Georgetown I am overjoyed to know I will extend my time on the Hilltop for just a little longer PERIOD
