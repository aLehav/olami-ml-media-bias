In a campaign season with few candidates the predictable occurred PERIOD The entire Students Voice Party was elected by about  percent of the student body to lead the Student Government in the  school year PERIOD



We congratulate the winners and keep our fingers crossed but our eyes wide open going into the fall PERIOD The members of the Students Voice party have the ability to lead and hopefully will follow through with the ideas and goals they set forth for themselves before the election PERIOD

It will be a young executive board filled with four sophomores and one senior PERIOD Hopefully excitement and drive will overcome some of the experience the group lacks PERIOD Also new student body president Alison Mormino and new student vice president for public affairs Marty Ruhaak should be ready to stand as the experienced part of the group and be able to provide a sense of history PERIOD

And now more than ever student apathy must be addressed PERIOD Only eight people ran for five positions leaving the president and student vice president for student affairs positions without opposition PERIOD Only  students voted in this election PERIOD Those are the biggest obstacles this group of students will have to overcome PERIOD

Every person who was elected is capable of doing their job PERIOD We have confidence in that PERIOD The part that leaves doubt is how well they will be able to do those jobs and expand their reach and the role of their office on a campus where so many dont care PERIOD From a lack of interested applicants to a measly  percent of students voting the job will be enormous PERIOD

Yes voting numbers are up from last year but that is just another sad fact in the sea of apathy that is becoming Eastern PERIOD

Mormino Ruhaak Lisa Flam student vice president for student affairs Ronnie Deedrick student vice president for academic affairs and Amy Leonard student vice president for financial affairs will certainly have a lot of work to do to get students on this campus motivated and interested PERIOD

We wish them the best of luck and continue to support efforts to bring information and interest to Eastern students PERIOD
