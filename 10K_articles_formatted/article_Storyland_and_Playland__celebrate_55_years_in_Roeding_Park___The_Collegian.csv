4040,2021-03-13,"generations of families relish in the simple things they pass down to younger generations PERIOD  Each spring Fresno follows in its own tradition Rotary Storyland and Playland in Roeding Park PERIOD  On Feb PERIOD  the park celebrated  years of business PERIOD

Opening week was the busiest three day weekend we have had since I took this position in  Barry Balke CEO of Storyland and Playland said PERIOD Our guests are what keeps Storyland and Playland alive and we work very hard to make sure their experience is memorable. the colored plastic keys will continue to bring life to many childhood favorites such as trains boats and roller coasters PERIOD Balke said they are hard at work updating many of the attractions PERIOD

We will be working on a remodel of our train depot at Playland Balke said PERIOD  This project comes from a  grant from the Lois Kyle Family who has been a big supporter of the train at Playland for years. the trains name The Willis B PERIOD Kyle Express Train gets its name from Lois Kyles late husband PERIOD In total we have completed over  in new improvements to the parks since  Balke said PERIOD

For this season there are a few new additions to the park PERIOD Last weekend we opened up a more interactive Pirate Ship at Storyland and a brand new exhibit called Mother Goose in California Balke said PERIOD

Fresno State graphic design instructor Doug Hansen is the author of the childrens book Mother Goose in California. hansen was approached by Balke about creating an exhibit based on the theme PERIOD

Its something that I wanted to do for a really long time Hansen said PERIOD  However he was unaware of how soon he would see his book come to life PERIOD

It all happened really fast Hansen said PERIOD  In October he was told a section of the park would be demolished PERIOD  By November construction on the novel exhibit was ready to begin PERIOD

Hansens illustrations are now literally larger than life PERIOD From the hedges to the fences to the tube which children crawl through to the red fence that appears on the cover of the book PERIOD

They took the book to the painter and had him match each color Hansen said PERIOD

When opening day arrived Hansen was on hand to read Mother Goose in California. its like a ripple in the pond PERIOD  It grows and touches other people Hansen said PERIOD  It amazes me how these things can grow. with each appearance the story of mother goose hard by new generations PERIOD

People would come to me and ask me if I wrote the rhymes Hansen said PERIOD  I made an assumption that people would know. hansen said he is very happy to introduce the characters to a new generation PERIOD

The new year has brought numerous events at the park PERIOD  Evening on Memory Lane a fundraiser in March Eggstravaganza an egg hunt in April as well as a few anniversary celebrations in May PERIOD

While some of the attractions may be aimed toward children and families Balke hopes to involve Fresno State students PERIOD

One of our greatest needs is volunteers with artistic ability to help repaint characters and exhibits at Storyland PERIOD  It seems once we get them all painted it is time to start again Balke said PERIOD  If there are any students with some art experience they would be a huge help. heather Heinks community relations manager for the Fresno Parks Department appreciates the parks relationship with its surrounding neighborhood PERIOD

While most Fresno parks are a major destination point in the city Roeding Park is still very much part of the neighborhood and continues to be the bestkept secret in the backyard Heinks said PERIOD

While most people look for forms of cheap family entertainment childrens admission into the Storyland is less than  and family passes are available. the park strives to maintain the attractions while allowing all walks of life to pass through PERIOD  Its motto Celebrating The Past Ensuring The Future conveys just that PERIOD
