ANDRIY PAZUNIAKHerald photo

No bigger than a singlecar garage the inconspicuous building is nothing more than what it looks like an old notsoglorified supply shed for a nearby bike store PERIOD

And though justifiably ignored by passersby walking from Regent Street to University Avenue that same little white warehouse currently lies at the center of one of the University of Wisconsins most significant  and contentious  legal battles PERIOD

 UW Associate Vice Chancellor Alan Fish said of acquiring the property PERIOD 

Insignificant as it might be in its current capacity the warehouse has one vital feature realtors have expounded for generations location PERIOD

Sandwiched between the Harry Harlow Primate Laboratory and the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center the warehouse is coveted by two groups standing on opposite sides of the animal research debate one of Madisons longestrunning controversies PERIOD

Internationally renowned for their contributions to the biological and psychological sciences the Harlow Laboratory and WNPRC are among the reasons why UW is considered one of the top research institutions in the country PERIOD

But their use of animals specifically monkeys to provide those contributions has for years sparked outrage from both local and national animalrights groups including the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals which earlier this year ranked UW the  among the nations research institutions PERIOD

And now because of the little white warehouse on Capitol Court the perpetual controversy once again finds itself in the forefront PERIOD

Both UW and the Madisonbased Alliance for Animals claim to have legally bought the property from Roger Charly the owner Budget Bicycle Center PERIOD

The university standing by its use of animals for medical and scientific research hopes to use the land to expand its primate research facilities PERIOD

The Alliance however which has adamantly opposed any animal research since its inception more than  years ago wants to build a museum on the property exhibiting its findings PERIOD

It is a situation that leaves little room for compromise and while a courts ruling on the land dispute is expected to arrive in a matter of days the larger controversy shows little sign of nearing a conclusion PERIOD

 WNPRC Director Joseph Kemnitz said of finding common ground between the animalresearch advocates and opponents PERIOD 

And whatever the outcome of the court case may be both the university and the alliance expect the decision to only add to the growing chasm between the two sides PERIOD

Inside the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center
The cages lining the white room inside the WNPRC rattle and clang as tiny monkeys take turns scampering across the metal bars PERIOD

Like furry Nerf balls the marmoset monkeys bounce around their pens many jumping and clinging to the thin rods in front of them as two visitors walk inside the room PERIOD

With small dark eyes the monkeys study their guests PERIOD They tilt their heads to either side revealing fluffs of hair died green orange and other vibrant colors for identification PERIOD

As one of the visitors approaches the rows of cages one bouncy marmoset cocks his head to the right and squirts a shot of urine straight through the gate and across the room PERIOD

Donned in attire more appropriate for a doctor heading into surgery than a public information officer Lenon was The Badger Heralds guide on a recent tour of the research center PERIOD

Housing more than  monkeys and more than  scientists studying them the WNPRC is one of eight federally funded primate centers in the nation and the only one in the Midwest PERIOD

And since its foundation the primate center has stood across the street from its research partner at UW the Harry Harlow Primate Laboratory PERIOD

Named after the pioneering UW psychological researcher the laboratory moved from its old building on University Avenue to its current location in the early 1950s PERIOD

Between the two buildings on Capitol Court an array of behavioral and medical science research is conducted using nonhuman primates ranging from observational studies to more intrusive ones such as those investigating HIV and AIDS PERIOD

 Kemnitz said PERIOD 

As part of the experimental procedure for many of the intrusive studies Kemnitz explained monkeys are often infected with the virus or disease being investigated and are studied as they live out the infection to its conclusion PERIOD

The method helps researchers control all the variables of their experiments Kemnitz said such as knowing exactly when and with what version of the virus the monkeys were infected PERIOD

UW professor Eric Sandgren who chairs the AllCampus Animal Care and Use Committee which oversees animal research at UW added that the intrusive HIVAIDS studies are just one example of medical research that is necessary for finding a cure to a human virus but ethically could not be done on people PERIOD

 Sandgren said PERIOD 

Throughout the process however Kemnitz insisted the monkeys are properly taken care of by researchers and staff veterinarians PERIOD

 Kemnitz said PERIOD 

That includes Kemnitz said giving the animals painkillers such as Tylenol if they develop routine muscle soreness or even stronger analgesics after the animals go through surgery PERIOD

There is also an extensive oversight network Kemnitz added at both the university and federal level which evaluates every facet of the primate research center from every project to every researcher to the center itself PERIOD

And the review process begins with the AllCampus Animal Care and Use Committee which must clear every animalresearch project at the primate center PERIOD

 Sandgren said PERIOD

According to Sandgren for each proposed animalresearch project the committee evaluates whether the research investigates  whether animals have to be used for the study as well as the procedures that would be performed during the experiment PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

And about  percent of the protocols get returned to the investigators with a series of questions Sandgren noted which have to be answered before a research project is approved by the committee PERIOD

However despites these efforts there have been incidents at the primate research center where monkeys were harmed during experiments sometimes fatally raising questions about how well monkeys are cared for at the center  and whether animal research should be conducted at all PERIOD

 research

Monkeys have died at Wisconsins research center  that much is fact and wont be argued by either the university or the activists protesting UWs use of animals for research PERIOD

However how those monkeys died and whether they should have been in any laboratory where they might remains a contentious and highly volatile question PERIOD

Both primate center officials and animal rights activists frequently cite two instances where a monkey at the research center died unexpectedly with the university calling them  and the activists claiming negligence PERIOD

The first is the case of primate center researcher Ei Terasawa who came under criticism when it was discovered an unsupervised monkey had died of a suspected heart attack during an experiment PERIOD

Though Kemnitz maintains the monkey simply died of old age rather than as a result of the experiment Terasawa was still suspended for two years because she violated the experiments approved protocol which called for constant surveillance PERIOD

The second incident occurred several summers ago when three monkeys were accidentally left in a cage during a scheduled cleaning and died after going through a mechanism Kemnitz called the 

While university officials usually end the discussion on controversial mishaps with those two incidents animal rights activists frequently cite numerous other cases and research studies revealing what they claim to be the primate research centers 

One is a situation that arose in  when The Capital Times reported that the primate research center had used  at the Henry Vilas Zoo for 

Kemnitz called the case  since the monkeys as well as the buildings they lived in were owned by the university and were always intended to be used for research PERIOD

However according to Rick Bogle a leading member of the Alliance for Animals it does not matter whether the university owned the monkeys and  to use them for research  the incident was immoral he said and scientifically irrelevant regardless PERIOD

 Bogle said PERIOD 

Citing the primate research centers HIVAIDS studies specifically Bogle argued the physical differences between humans and monkeys would prevent any nonhuman primate study from being applicable to people PERIOD

 Bogle said PERIOD 

The future of UW primate research

From behind his desk at the primate research center Kemnitz remains optimistic about the future of primate research at UW and is particularly hopeful that an AIDS vaccine would be discovered at the universitys research center PERIOD

 Kemnitz said PERIOD 

As for the animal research debate no one anticipates it going away any time soon PERIOD

Bogle simply summed it up by saying it would be 

 Bogle said PERIOD 

And neither is the primate research center which is why both sides said the little white warehouse property was so important PERIOD

If UW succeeds in obtaining the property Associate Vice Chancellor Alan Fish said the university could continue its planned expansion of the primate research center and primate research itself could continue to take place uninterrupted PERIOD

However if the property is awarded to the Alliance for Animals and it builds its museum Fish said the entire scope of the animal research debate at Madison could be amplified to an unprecedented degree  forcing UW to respond in a somewhat drastic and costly manner PERIOD

 Fish said PERIOD 

Fish estimates that the move would cost the university  to  million more in overhead PERIOD

But no decision has been made yet allowing for the longstanding controversy to continue simmering PERIOD
