8146,2004-03-23,"unfortunately the Jeffs bowed to the Ephs for the third time this season and I was forced to root against Williams rather than for Amherst in the finals PERIOD I got some but not nearly enough joy from watching the Ephs lose on a lastsecond fadeaway in the finals but it just wasnt the same PERIOD

So instead of writing about the Div PERIOD III tournament I guess Ill have to settle for the Div PERIOD I tournament which has less personal value but many more stories and drama PERIOD Every year people talk about one game that was a real bracket buster an upset of a team that everyone thought would make it deep into the tournament PERIOD Right now after two rounds of play there have been at least six bracket busters PERIOD Dicky V is going crazy this is awesome baby Jay Bilas has thrown his hands up in the air and his microphone to the ground and Billy Packer is talking to other people rather than to himself for a change PERIOD

I like everyone else with a pulse am totally screwed in the brackets I filled out PERIOD Despite filling out multiple read five ESPN Tournament Challenge entries I find myself with very few teams left PERIOD In one entry I am in the . percentile but have only one Final Four team remaining PERIOD In another bracket I am in the . percentile but with all four Final Four teams remaining PERIOD That one has some potential but not much PERIOD To make a long story short my brackets are in rough shape but so are everyone elses PERIOD Shows how little even the basketball experts on ESPN really know about the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

This years tournament has been all about overrated high seeds and underrated low seeds PERIOD Stanford and Gonzaga were seen as overrated teams coming into the tournament and just as expected both fell in the second round PERIOD I was never sold on the Stanford Cardinal even with only one loss on the season and had a feeling theyd be upset early on in the tournament PERIOD The second ranked Zags despite having only two losses and a ratings percentage index RPI of  were hardly expected to contend for the national championship PERIOD In my mind Gonzaga and St PERIOD Josephs are the TCU of the NCAA Tournamentteams with great records from a midmajor conference trying to prove themselves worthy of top rankings PERIOD Look for St PERIOD Josephs to get blown out of the water by Wake Forest on Thursday PERIOD

At the top Duke and UConn look very strong PERIOD The Blue Devils have dismantled their first two opponents by  and  points and seem to be handling their injuries well PERIOD With arguably the most talented lineup and the most experienced point guard in the country Chris Duhon Duke has all the ingredients this season PERIOD UConn also looks like a team on a mission PERIOD No team can match up with the talent of Emeka Okafor Ben Gordon and Taliek Brown PERIOD If Emeka Okafor can avoid more back problems the Huskies should be playing at the Alamodome on April  PERIOD

The team that no one was talking about last week and everyone was talking about this weekend defending champion Syracuse is back at it again in the Sweet Sixteen PERIOD With everyone but Carmelo Anthony back this season the Cuse is battletested and hungry for another shot at the title PERIOD If you saw its first round win over BYU you know what Im talking about PERIOD Gerry McNamara carried the Orangemen on his back scoring  points on  shooting from threepoint range PERIOD I cant remember ever seeing an individual performance quite like McNamaras in all my years of watching the NCAA Tournament PERIOD Unfortunately for the Orangemen redhot UConn looms in Elite Eight PERIOD

With the field down to  its time to make some predictions PERIOD Ive already mentioned my inclination toward UConn in the Phoenix Region even though I wouldnt be shocked to see Syracuse in the Final Four again PERIOD I think Duke will emerge from the Atlanta Region after a tough fight with upsetminded Xavier which has looked very impressive thus far PERIOD In the East Rutherford Region I think Pittsburgh after defeating Wisconsin in the second round has the momentum needed to pull off an upset over Oklahoma State and then defeat either St PERIOD Joes or Wake Forest in the regional finals PERIOD

In the St PERIOD Louis Region anything can happen PERIOD With topseeded Kentucky out of the tournament at the hands of University of AlabamaBirmingham all hell has broken loose PERIOD Kansas a team that no one has really been talking about has a great shot at reaching the Final Four PERIOD The Jayhawks after losing coach Roy Williams to North Carolina were not expected to contend during this transition season but seem to have put themselves right back into the national championship mix PERIOD Kansas best player Wayne Simien is on a mission this season after missing last years tournament because of injury and has been dominant thus far in the teams two victories PERIOD

Its a little premature to make championship predictions so Ill leave it at this and youll just have to wait and see what happens PERIOD If the next three rounds are anything like the first two this years tournament will be one to remember PERIOD","Tourney talk: ""bracket busters""",Amherst College
