8154,2021-09-29,"tim Song is a neuroscience and music double major PERIOD His thesis looks at how Kpop affects mental health and Asian American identity PERIOD His thesis advisor is Professor of Music Jeffers Engelhardt PERIOD

Q What is your thesis about

A My thesis is about how Kpop affects mental health PERIOD Thats my general topic and Im still currently exploring what I want to do with it but it originally stemmed from an idea in terms of how Kpop affects mental health and Asian Americans PERIOD Especially through the recent Korean Wave theres been a lot more Korean media and Kpop in America and the identity of the Asian American has also been a lot more prevalent in social media and in general PERIOD I wanted to see how the prevalence of both of these events  the rise of both the Asian American in society as well as Kpop and Korean music  would affect mental health PERIOD

Q What inspired you to pursue this topic

A Back in my second year I had a pretty rough time with my own mental health PERIOD I had a pretty severe depressive episode in the fall of  and through this time I wasnt really able to rely on anything  I wasnt able to reach out to my friends I wasnt able to reach out to family or at least it didnt feel like I was able to PERIOD But one thing that did help me through this time was my reliance on Kpop both as a genre and as an industry PERIOD Through fandoms and social media and just consuming culture I was able to see myself and find serotonin and little things here and there PERIOD But also the music both in terms of lyrical content and sonical elements  how the melody was structured and the instrumentalization of each piece  helped me to maintain my wellbeing PERIOD

With this personal experience of having gone through a crisis and been helped by Kpop I also began to be more aware of how at large society is affected by Kpop as well PERIOD I often saw accounts on Twitter of different people being like Oh Ive been able to get through soandso situations because of Kpop. i saw a lot of my other friends as well were able to be sustained by Kpop through their own troubles and I thought that this would be a really interesting phenomenon to look at through a more academic lens PERIOD I did my own research while studying for some of my music classes on where that intersectionality lies in terms of Kpop Asian identity American identity and mental health and I found that there was almost no literature done on this topic PERIOD I feel like its important especially with the rise of popular culture in a more global sense that this topic be looked at academically as well PERIOD

Q Who are some of your favorite Korean artists and did they shape your research at all

A Yes and no PERIOD My favorite Korean artist at the time was SEVENTEEN which is a 13member boy group that produces their own music PERIOD I think what initially drew me to them was that they made their own music PERIOD As a music major I was like Wow this is really cool that they do that. in fact in the first music class that I took here my first project was a song analysis of  by SEVENTEEN PERIOD

As I went through my troubles in  SEVENTEEN also released tracks that focused more on health and wellbeing and loving yourself around early  PERIOD It was really interesting to see this shift from Kpop being a genre less about words and meaning to one that focuses on the individual and wellbeing PERIOD I was like This is a shift that Ive never seen before and its something that can be looked at. i think that along with all my other interests helped shape my path PERIOD

Q What is your favorite part of the research process so far

A My favorite part so far has just been being able to bring the artists that I enjoy talking about and listening to as well as my own experiences into a more academic setting PERIOD Combining my nonacademic more musical interests along with what Ive enjoyed doing in terms of the analysis of music has been also a really enjoyable time just being able to integrate all of that PERIOD

Q What are some challenges that youve encountered in your research

A Ill mention two of my biggest issues that Im facing right now PERIOD One would be the fact that there isnt an Asian American studies major on campus PERIOD That really makes things so much harder because I want my thesis to be able to focus on Asian American studies and how mental health has been a theme thats been brought across from America to Asia and Kpop serves as the best vessel in terms of both sending the theme of mental health over to Korea but also bringing it back to America as well PERIOD Its kind of being used to bring awareness to Korea of what mental health is PERIOD Because I dont have any guidance in terms of how to navigate that from an Asian American studies lens its been difficult PERIOD And because of that my second worry is its been hard to find what direction to approach this from whether it be a psychological approach where I look more at how the brain is shaped by music or a more anthropological approach where we look at how culture and music shapes the self PERIOD So because Im stuck at a point where Im not sure how to even start dissecting these arguments I think those are my two big issues PERIOD

Q How have you been working to overcome these challenges

A I really think its just continuing to let it brew talking to a lot of people about it or reaching out to both my advisor and also other people in adjacent fields PERIOD I think thats the best way to get at it honestly PERIOD

Q Who is your thesis advisor and how are they supporting you in this process

A My thesis advisor is Professor of Music Jeffers Engelhardt PERIOD Great man PERIOD I took two courses with him last year  one on methods of musical analysis and one on the anthropology of voice and music PERIOD Both classes prepared me to do the work that Im doing right now in conducting sonical analyses and gathering data and looking at music from an ethnological  no I dont like that word  a more cultural lens PERIOD Its been great hes been very supportive PERIOD Like most thesis students I meet with him once a week to talk and we have fun deadlines PERIOD

Q What is the most rewarding part of your research

A I think the most rewarding part will be seeing all of this come to an end seeing that I was able to come up with a research question that I care a lot about and that I relate to and address it through my analyses and interviews PERIOD

Q Does this thesis relate to what you will pursue in the future

A Thats a great question PERIOD As of now no PERIOD One of the reasons why I wanted to do a thesis was because I felt like I wouldnt have the chance to do an independent project like this about something that Im passionate about within music PERIOD When I first came to Amherst up until sophomore year I was dead set on not doing a thesis because I didnt think Id be able to do independent work like that PERIOD But I think both the push from my advisor in terms of his own passions as well as the passions of those around me who are also doing theses as well as my own growth as a person and as a learner has been able to support me in actually doing this large project PERIOD Its daunting for sure but Im also really excited to see where its gonna go PERIOD

Q What advice would you give to a student whos considering writing a thesis in the future

A This is the same advice that was given to me by other previous alumni who have written theses dont do a thesis just because you want it on your degree and dont do one just because you think itll help for grad school PERIOD I think you should do a thesis because you genuinely genuinely care about what you do and because you enjoy the work that youre doing PERIOD Its definitely a push out of your comfort zone and thats okay as long as you know that you have the drive to continue going PERIOD You dont want to start a thesis and then end up giving up halfway through because you realize you dont care about it anymore PERIOD

Q Do you have any advice on doing a thesis in a subject area like yours that doesnt have much prior literature

A Start early All the advice that my upperclassmen also gave me was start early start in the summer start in the fall semester PERIOD I unfortunately did not follow their advice with the summer because I did not do any thesis work in the summer but I think just starting early in order to get your background research set would be the best advice I can give PERIOD Even now Im thinking about what I originally wanted to do with my thesis and what Im currently going to do and they are a little bit different because of the restrictions that I face with time and resources PERIOD So just getting work done earlier would be my biggest advice PERIOD I know there are a lot of seniors who spent this past summer at Amherst working on their theses and I know that because of that theyve been able to get a head start PERIOD One of my friends has a draft of their first chapter done already PERIOD If you are really passionate I think thats also something you could look into PERIOD",Thoughts on Theses: Tim Song,Amherst College
