Molly McKew a recently hired adjunct professor teaching a course on Russian disinformation campaigns for the School of Foreign Service has faced criticism from colleagues and news outlets for her former status as a foreign lobbyist PERIOD

McKew who holds a masters degree in Russian and PostSoviet Studies and has served as an advisor to political parties in Georgia and Moldova is teaching her first course at Georgetown this semester PERIOD The course entitled Russian Hybrid Warfare focuses on the history of Russian ideology and information warfare PERIOD McKew also currently serves as the CEO of Fianna Strategies a consulting firm PERIOD

Greg Afinogenov an assistant professor of Imperial Russian History at Georgetown criticized the universitys hiring of McKew PERIOD In a series of tweets Afinogenov wrote that McKews history as a foreign lobbyist posed several conflicts of interest to her role as a professor PERIOD

A student who takes her class will not know which of her ideas are truth which are credible suppositions and which are complete fabrications Afinogenov wrote in a Jan PERIOD  tweet PERIOD

McKew has written articles for several publications including Politico and The Washington Post and has also served as a commentator for TV and radio shows such as Frontline PERIOD

McKews writings are not academic in nature and do not qualify her as a scholar or an expert Afinogenov wrote in an email to The Hoya PERIOD

McKew is an example of exactly the kind of journalist whose articles should be corrected by scholars the claims she makes are outlandish escalationist and rooted in a history of working for foreign governments with an interest in influencing public debate in the United States Afinogenov wrote PERIOD

McKew stated that her critics are furthering an effort to discredit her and the threat of Russian hybrid warfare PERIOD Her history as an advisory to political leaders in Moldova and Georgia only made her more qualified for the position at the university she wrote in an email to The Hoya PERIOD

The idea that being a foreign agent disqualifies my experience ignores that what I know about how the Kremlin attacks its opponents comes from working as an advisor to countries under attack McKew wrote PERIOD

McKew is respected by many within her field which is what led to the universitys initial contact with her Vice Dean of the School of Foreign Service Daniel Byman said in an interview with The Hoya PERIOD

She came to us wellrecommended from a number of individuals in the national security committee and that was the kind of basis for reaching out to her Byman said PERIOD

The university hired McKew in response to Russias growing prominence in international relations following its interference in the  U.S PERIOD presidential election according to Byman PERIOD

U.S PERIOD intelligence agencies following have since determined that the Kremlin likely engaged in information warfare to sow distrust and support President Donald Trumps campaign PERIOD

McKew plans to use her work in countries previously attacked by Russian hybrid warfare to explore how the United States can best respond to interference in its elections according to her courses description PERIOD

Criticism for McKew has not stopped with Afinogenovs tweets as other media outlets reported and similarly cast doubt over McKews qualifications for her position at Georgetown PERIOD

Leonid Bershidsky a columnist for Bloomberg also questioned McKews credibility on Russian disinformation campaigns arguing that McKew among many other American experts replaces nuanced arguments with those based on simplified Cold War models PERIOD

Afinogenovs tweets criticizing McKew were referenced in an article on RT a Russian statebacked news outlet charged by the Columbia Journalism Review as acting as a propaganda PERIOD

Afinogenov wrote that he was disappointed to see his tweets on RT PERIOD

This was not my intent I do not endorse propaganda channels like RT and was not invited to comment on the article that quoted my tweets Afinogenov wrote PERIOD

McKew has come under criticism from RT before for antiRussian rhetoric. rT targeting McKew is evidence of the her qualifications Joel Harding a consultant for information operations and cyber warfare wrote in a Jan PERIOD  blog post PERIOD

If RT notices you and writes a smear piece on you that means youve made it Harding wrote PERIOD

Those currently attacking the credentials of McKew who has twice testified in front of Congress on Russian interference in the  election are actually aiding Russian disinformation campaigns Harding wrote PERIOD

None of these socalled experts have the bona fides she does against Russian propaganda and disinformation programs yet they seemingly gleefully contribute to Russias efforts to undermine US counterRussian disinformation efforts by attacking her. vlad says
