On Oct PERIOD  Theo Epstein fled Boston for the Chicago Cubs PERIOD To make matters worse The Boston Globe printed a scathing article on the Red Soxs collapse that same morning

The piece was ripped apart almost instantaneously by pundits who cited the authors many unnamed sources as shady journalism PERIOD Personally the unnamed sources doesnt particularly bother me PERIOD I do however have a problem with the implications of the article PERIOD

The article implies that John Lackey Jon Lester and Josh Beckett are responsible for the Sox collapse due to their frequent ingame clubhouse hangouts which allegedly included beer fried chicken and video games PERIOD

The September struggles of Beckett Lester and Lackey have been well documented as they should be PERIOD

That being said the trio did not start all  September games for Boston PERIOD In fact they started  of them leaving the remaining  starts to Tim Wakefield Kyle Weilland Erik Bedard and Andrew Miller PERIOD

Those  starts went extremely poorly with just three resulting in a win for the Red Sox PERIOD

Ultimately the backend of the rotation was completely unable to log quality innings for the floundering Sox team PERIOD

Here was the extent of the September contributions from Weilland Miller Wakefield and Bedard

Weilland started three games and went  PERIOD

Miller lasted just in an inning and a third in one of his starts and allowed  runs over the span of two games PERIOD

Wakefield pitched respectable for the most part but also allowed at least five runs in all four of his starts PERIOD

Bedards last two starts came against weakhitting Baltimore but somehow managed to throw just six combined innings against the Os PERIOD

What disappoints me about the article is that there are a number of other reasons why the Sox collapsed and none of them include a couple pitchers downing some beers in the clubhouse PERIOD

How about Daniel Bard singlehandedly costing Boston at least three games

How about just terrible luck in general According to The New York Times statistician Nate Silver the events that unfolded in September could only happen once in  million tries PERIOD

Blame the collapse on poor starting pitching a poor bullpen untimely hitting or terrible luck but dont think that the actions of a few misbehaving pitchers cost Boston a playoff spot PERIOD

Lackey was definitely in my opinion the worst of the pitchers excluding Weiland PERIOD Andrew Miller had some respectable starts and may I remind you that mostly in September he didnt even pitch but once PERIOD Wakefield should have been put out of his misery after he won his two hundredth win PERIOD Mostly Lackey and Bedard plus a little help from Bard made the Red Sox lose and the beer evidently didnt help did it for Lester and Beckett did it I rest my case PERIOD",Don’t Blame it on the Alcohol – Massachusetts Daily Collegian,University of Massachusetts Amherst
