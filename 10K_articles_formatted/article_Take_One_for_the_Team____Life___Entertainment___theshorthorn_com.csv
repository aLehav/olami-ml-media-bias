University shouldnt worry about flu shot shortages but should still get vaccinated

Due to last years shortage of flu shots Health Services will administer vaccines to priority groups including children the elderly and health care personnel first PERIOD The university community shouldnt be concerned about vaccine shortages because Health Services is expecting  which is more than it had last year PERIOD

The health center will give vaccinations to atrisk or priority patients beginning Oct PERIOD  PERIOD They have  doses right now and are expecting more PERIOD

The last thing people want is to be bedridden for a week coughing sneezing and experiencing hell PERIOD While it might seem tempting to spread the epidemic so others can feel your pain its better not to PERIOD

The vaccination costs  on campus and the university community should take advantage of this PERIOD If you are not in a priority group and dont wish to wait for your vaccination there are other places in Arlington also administering shots PERIOD The downside is that these places are charging more than what the university is PERIOD

The Albertsons pharmacy on Collins Street it will be administering vaccinations beginning Oct PERIOD  for  dollars with a Preferred Card and  without one PERIOD

Currently Arlington Minor Emergency Clinic CareNow on Cooper Street and the Arlington Memorial Hospital are not administering vaccinations and dont know when they will begin PERIOD

Due to their close proximity with each other those living in residence halls will be at great risk and are likely to spread infection PERIOD With midterms coming up its not the best time for students to get sick PERIOD

If you are past due for one you should find somewhere to get vaccinated so that you dont become sick and spread the flu to others PERIOD
