A resolution urging the University to pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  percent by  passed unanimously in the Student Senate Wednesday PERIOD

The resolution presented by Student Environmental Task Force cochairs Felipe Witchger and Zach Einterz also calls for a longterm commitment to carbon neutrality PERIOD

The Task Force is a volunteer group of club leaders that meets occasionally to discuss ways to make campus more environmentally friendly Einterz said PERIOD

The resolution describes global climate change as one of the most serious challenges facing humanity today and says Notre Dame has a moral obligation to safeguard Creation for future generations. the resolution cites the grade of D received by Notre Dame on the  College Sustainability Report Card as a reason necessitating the resolution PERIOD The data used in the study conducted by the Sustainable Endowments Institute was questioned by University administrators who said that no one from the Institute ever spoke with a University representative and that the information used in the evaluation came only from Notre Dames Web site PERIOD

Einterz credited the University with looking at ways to decrease energy use and increase energy efficiency and said it has expanded its recycling program PERIOD However Notre Dame still lags behind its peers in environmentally sustainable practices he said PERIOD

One of the reasons for that Einterz said is our administrative support hasnt been as strong as we would like. more work can be done by the University Einterz said PERIOD

The purpose of the resolution he said is for the University to publicly say they are committed to dealing with climate change in a concrete and definable way. the resolution acknowledges that Executive Vice President John AffleckGraves created the Energy and Environmental Issues Committee in January  PERIOD The committees Web site says its intent is to broaden energy and environmental awareness report on Notre Dame green initiatives and advise University leadership on ecofriendly opportunities. witchger sits on the committee PERIOD

Witchger said he did not have data on the current levels of greenhouse gases emitted by the campus PERIOD But he said  percent is a feasible goal for the University by  PERIOD Harvard University has reduced its emissions by six percent in the past two years he said PERIOD

Ten percent is a very basic a very small goal Witchger said PERIOD

If the University were more progressive he said it could probably reduce emissions by  percent by  PERIOD

This ten percent would just give a public statement saying the student body wants to take action forward he said PERIOD
