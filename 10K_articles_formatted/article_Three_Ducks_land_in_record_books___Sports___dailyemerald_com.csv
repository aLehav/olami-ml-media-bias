7640,1970-01-01,"in her sixth season at the helm Oregon womens soccer head coach Tara Erickson has accumulated  total wins making her the alltime Ducks leader PERIOD Erickson surpassed former coach Bill Steffen whose  victories was the previous high PERIOD Erickson saw the accomplishment as a testament to her players PERIOD

I think it just shows the level of players that we have here Erickson said PERIOD

Despite outscoring their opponents by a combined six goals over the first half of the schedule the Ducks are  with just one nonconference game to go PERIOD

Erickson became the Ducks alltime wins leader after a  overtime victory against San Diego State at the  Oregon State Nike Invitational in Corvallis PERIOD It was the first overtime win for Oregon in four matches PERIOD Sophomore midfielder Scout Libke netted the goal which ended the match in the fifth minute of the first overtime period PERIOD Erickson saw the framework of the match as one which her Ducks could build on PERIOD

The Aztecs are a very tough team and it gave us a ton of confidence moving forward Erickson said PERIOD

Senior midfielder Kirstie Kuhns forged her way into the record books against Butler contributing four goals in the Ducks  win PERIOD Kuhns mark puts her in a threeway tie atop the Oregon alltime leader board for goals in a single game PERIOD The senior who recorded just one goal last year has been moved from her traditional home on the defense side to aid Oregons strikers up front PERIOD

Kirstie really is a leader on this team Erickson said PERIOD The switch was a tactical move after the first seven games of the season. the game Kuhns had against Butler indicates the rotation might be permanent PERIOD However Kuhns and Erickson were not the only ones to catapult their way into the record book PERIOD

Senior forward Jen Stoltenberg made sure to join the party as she climbed atop the Oregon all time leader board in assists with  PERIOD Stoltenberg remains the Ducks points leader and her  shots are second only to Stanfords Christen Press in the Pac10 PERIOD

Most recently the Ducks suffered a setback at Santa Clara falling to the No PERIOD  Broncos  last Friday PERIOD The loss goes down as just another narrow defeat for the Ducks but Erickson saw a significant upside to the contest PERIOD

I thought we went into the game intimidated Erickson said PERIOD If we played the second  as well as the first  I think that match is a different story. in that match the Ducks trailed by two at halftime and got help from a Stoltenberg goal in the second half but could not overcome the clock as they ran out of time for the comeback PERIOD

The Ducks will need to overcome the nerves they felt at Buck Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara if they hope to pick up a win this weekend PERIOD The team is focused on making a statement against No PERIOD  Portland on Friday PERIOD The Pilots hold a record of  their lone loss coming at the hands of No PERIOD  Stanford last weekend PERIOD The match will be the final primer for the Ducks before the start of Pac10 play PERIOD

Its going to be a fantastic environment under the lights in Portland it doesnt get any better Coach Erickson said PERIOD We want to play these big teams in big games thats why were here. sportsdailyemerald.com
