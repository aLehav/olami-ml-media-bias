5037,2023-11-04,"minnesota began the year with nine straight and was still unbeaten after  games

by  Brett AngelPublished  December  

Minnesota womens hockey players skated slowly toward the bench after concluding Tuesdays practice with a series of grueling ladder workouts and skating drills PERIOD

Several braced themselves on the boards while a few sat down on the bench in exhaustion PERIOD

That was the toughest practice of the season senior defender and alternate captain Winny Brodt said as she grabbed a green Gatorade bottle and squirted water through her face mask PERIOD

After finishing the best first half in team history with a weekend sweep of Minnesota StateMankato and a  record  WCHA you might expect head coach Laura Halldorson to take it easy on her team PERIOD Youd be wrong PERIOD

In terms of our record Im very pleased with where we are Halldorson said PERIOD But one of my philosophies is to never be satisfied PERIOD I want us to keep getting better. despite their physical condition Tuesday afternoon the Gophers have a lot to feel good about heading into their monthlong holiday break PERIOD

Minnesota began the year with nine straight victories and after  games the team remained unbeaten PERIOD The Gophers beat four nationallyranked teams in the month of November alone PERIOD

The team has also witnessed firsthand the emergence well more like the explosion of some of the best young talent in the country PERIOD

Freshman standouts and former Olympians Krissy Wendell and Natalie Darwitz have garnered a total of eight conference awards between them PERIOD The WCHA plaques are being sent so frequently that theyre piling up in the teams media relations office PERIOD Wendell and Darwitz rank in the nations top four in scoring goals and assists PERIOD

Sophomore goalie Jody Horak has developed into one of the best goalies in the country boasting a . save percentage and . gAA PERIOD Horak has started  of the Gophers  games and appears to have beaten out teammate Brenda Reinen for the teams starting spot PERIOD

But for all the positive things that happened in the first half of the season the players will remember those things that didnt go their way PERIOD

Minnesota was unable to earn a point in its twogame series against twotime defending national champion MinnesotaDuluth which was the first team to leave Ridder Arena with a W.

The whole UMD series put a lot of things into perspective for our team Brodt said PERIOD We learned a lot and because of that series were going to be a better team in the end. the Gophers did come back with two victories last weekend to end their December schedule on a winning note but looked tired and uninspired throughout much of the series against lastplace Minnesota StateMankato PERIOD

We have a lot to work on and it showed on the ice sophomore forward Kelly Stephens said PERIOD

Senior captain Ronda Curtin emphasized defense and teamwork as areas where the Gophers need improvement PERIOD

Halldorson blames a tough November schedule and some long traveling weekends for Minnesotas minor letdown but remains confident in her teams ability to continue its success after the break and into the postseason PERIOD

Im not against having bumps in the road Halldorson said PERIOD Sometimes when its too easy and youre coasting you dont go through the challenges and the obstacles that can really help a team in the end. halldorsons point is perfectly illustrated by what happened to Minnesota three years ago PERIOD

December of  was the last time the Gophers were swept at home PERIOD Those two losses like the two against MinnesotaDuluth this year also came in the first weekend of December at the hands of the Bulldogs PERIOD

That Gophers team finished the first semester with five losses  the most in program history PERIOD Perhaps its just coincidence that that team also went on to win the only national championship in Minnesota womens hockey history PERIOD

Sometimes its a blessing in disguise when you cant beat a team said Brodt who played on that  national championship team PERIOD When it comes down to it Id rather win the big game than these games that dont mean as much. brett Angel covers womens hockey and welcomes comments at emailprotected
