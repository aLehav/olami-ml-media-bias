Over the weekend  members of The Daily Eastern News attended the Illinois Collegiate Press Associations annual conference at the Double Tree Hilton Hotel in Chicago PERIOD



We feel fortunate to have attended the conference which featured both useful tips and experiences told by esteemed journalists from around the state and a reminder of the competition we face from other student newspapers across the state PERIOD

Ted Gregory a Pulitzer Prize winning Chicago Tribune reporter and Eastern alumnus was one of many professionals who taught lessons to the students they might not have gotten anywhere else PERIOD Gregory led a session on how to be a better reporter where he shared many techniques hes used in his reporting including always looking for stories wherever you are PERIOD

Mark Konkol a reporter for the Chicago SunTimes who won a Pulitzer Prize for local reporting last year delivered the keynote address in front of everyone at the conference on Friday night PERIOD He was frank with the aspiring journalists and told them if they doubted their desire to put in the work expected of a professional journalist then they should do themselves and everyone vying for one of the few jobs available a favor and quit now PERIOD

Beyond the advice of industry professionals the ICPA conference was a great opportunity to meet our fellow student journalists in the state PERIOD

Besides the keynote address everyone was in the same room at the same time for the awards ceremony on Saturday PERIOD

If merely seeing the hundreds of other collegiate journalists was not enough to remind us the media is inherently rife with rivalry competing against one another definitely was PERIOD

Students competed in a variety of categories including news sports opinions features design and photography PERIOD Because of the large variety in size and type of university in Illinois there were three different groups Nondaily papers with a student population of under  nondaily papers with a population over  and daily papers PERIOD

We are proud of the  awards we took home which you can read about on Page  but the conference was more than that PERIOD

Competing against our peers and learning from the examples set by local professionals was a great reminder of the shortterm college goals and longterm professional goals that unite us as students who want to practice journalism now and in the future PERIOD

Producing a daily newspaper while trying to balance classes and homework can be taxing and its easy to lose sight of the bigger picture in the midst of the constant churning PERIOD

But we do this because we love it and because we believe that our work has value to both the community and to our education as journalists PERIOD

Having that work recognized only pushes us to redouble our efforts in providing quality content to the Eastern community PERIOD
