It happened early in the Penn State womens soccer teams game against Richmond PERIOD

Forward Maya Hayes had been knocked woozy after a shot was deflected off her forehead prompting the coaches to sub her off PERIOD To replace Hayes Nittany Lions coach Erica Walsh shifted freshman Kori Chapic from left back to forward leaving a gap in her back line PERIOD

Without hesitation Walsh turned to another freshman to step in PERIOD

Whitney Church stepped onto the field and slid seamlessly into the left back spot just like she has every other time she has been called upon this season PERIOD

She is so composed as a freshman Walsh said PERIOD Shes come in and played some different spots in that back line she can play centre back PERIOD I have so much faith in Whit. church has appeared in all six of the Nittany Lions games this season playing  minutes but hasnt gotten a start yet PERIOD Its to be expected with so much veteran depth along the defense however and the freshman has simply answered the call when told to warm up PERIOD

This weekend the Lions will travel to Churchs home state of Virginia and the Ashburn native will get to play in front of her friends and family as the Lions take on Central Florida today at  p.m PERIOD and Virginia at  p.m PERIOD Sunday PERIOD Going up against two talented teams that will look to push the pace and run at the Lions Church will be counted on to keep her composure along the back line PERIOD

Shes been really important senior defender Emma Thomson said PERIOD As weve tired during the games we know Whit can just come in and you dont notice the change which is always good PERIOD She comes in with a spark shes comfortable on the ball and she can play it out wide so its good PERIOD We dont notice the change and theres not a drop in our play. topDrawerSoccer.com rated Church as the secondbest defender and tenth overall recruit in the  class PERIOD As a star in both high school and club Church was used to starting games and staying in for the duration but has had to adapt to a role as a sub at Penn State PERIOD

In soccer the back line sees the fewest subs because of the continuity required between the defenders and goalkeeper PERIOD The freshman said she didnt expect to play as much as she has so far but added its been an honor to be on the field and to see the coaches have trust in her PERIOD

I feel like I did pretty well in preseason Church said PERIOD I struggled a little bit in the beginning with the speed of play because its definitely way different than your high school team or your club team because its a faster pace PERIOD Just getting my bearings straight with that was one of my big concerns and big efforts and I think I picked it up pretty well. as a reserve Church has different responsibilities but she recognizes that and has worked to make sure she comes into each game ready PERIOD While the link between defenders is so key Church said the team rotates on the back line in practice and the reps have helped her get a feel for all of her fellow defenders PERIOD

I have to make sure I give my team fresh legs and a fresh start Church said PERIOD I have to put everything out there on the line to help my team out to give us a leg up PERIOD

Playing mostly at outside back Church has to match up with the oppositions quickest players and said speed of the game and reading the play have been the main things shes been working on PERIOD

The only other thing the coaches have been working on is communication PERIOD Walsh said Church is a very good communicator but she just has to get her confidence up to be heard PERIOD She has her teammates trust she needs to be more assertive PERIOD

She can play every spot in the back line she can play holding mid shes going to be a big piece this year and going forward Walsh said PERIOD
