1478,2023-11-04,"the Associated Students Inc PERIOD board of directors ruled that a reelection would be too expensive after the judicial council made the proposal due to grievances candidates filed against one another PERIOD

Candidates filed grievances against one another this past month during the ASI election claiming that their opponents have broken election codes such as campaigning in nondesignated areas using a residential assistant program to bribe students and conducting doortodoor solicitations in the dorms PERIOD

Interim ASI Executive Director Aimee Barnes suggested a new election process after witnessing the complications surrounding the elections and the difficulty candidates are facing due to the grievances they filed against one another PERIOD

The total amount spent on this election added up to   paid by SF State students  and conducting a new election would require the same amount PERIOD The motion for a special reelection failed PERIOD

Barnes believed that these issues resulted from a lastminute decision in February to have an election packet and that inconsistencies in the elections code are now being used as loopholes PERIOD

Ive seen things in this election process that I have never seen before Barnes said PERIOD Ive had colleagues comment about this election process PERIOD Im embarrassed. an ASI board meeting planned to deliberate eight cases on Wednesdays meeting but only tackled two because of differing opinions on how to address the Harvill et al v PERIOD Thomas et al grievance case PERIOD

The case alleges that Jordan Thomas Asia Island Gaby Cerros and Alisar Mustafa used the residential assistant program to bribe students to vote and precluded other candidates from participating according to the grievance filed by JamesHarvill. claimant Jordan JamesHarvill asserted that Thomas and members involved violated Section IX of SF States election code packet which states that candidates shall not direct AS employees staff etc PERIOD to campaign on his or her behalf PERIOD Additionally candidates shall not direct SFSU administrators staff professor teacher assistants faculty members etc PERIOD to campaign on his or her behalf. the defendant Thomas vice president of internal affairs denied the allegations PERIOD

I was in a separate group PERIOD At no point did anybody say hey vote for Stronger Together Thomas said PERIOD

The judicial council voted to dismiss the case in a  two in favor one opposed and one abstained vote concluding that there was no evidence supporting JamesHarvills claims PERIOD

Vice President of External Affairs Celia LoBuono Gonzalez who opposed the suggestion to conduct a new election expressed her disappointment in the councils recommended disposition on the grievance PERIOD

LoBuono Gonzalez claimed that it was unreasonable to conclude that there wasnt enough evidence to support the claims PERIOD

I encourage you all to look at the statements provided by the Justices LoBuono Gonzalez said PERIOD The dismissing opinion stated that there wasnt enough evidence but there was over  pages of evidence submitted that included audio recording testimonies multiple student and candidates statements and photos. loBuono Gonzalez also pointed out the councils blatant disregard for Justice Alfred Alexanders statement corroborating claims in the grievance PERIOD

I was physically there when I saw slate Stronger Together handing out donuts to people who had voted Alexander said PERIOD

Alexander also stated that the councils recommendation to dismiss the case was not the right choice and recommended that the votes following the incidents should not be counted PERIOD

Evan Gothelf who also filed a grievance against Jordan Thomas moved to redact Strong Together votes earned on April  from  p.m PERIOD to April   p.m PERIOD

LoBuono Gonzalez second the motion and the board of directors decided that it wouldnt be fair to eliminate votes for that 24hour period because other factors independent from the allegations contributed to those votes PERIOD

That day on the fifth was when we released our video which had  views and I also talked to organizations that day unofficial president Jacqueline Foley said PERIOD I want to make those things clear because this affects the official election results. foley also clarified that even though she was mentioned in most of the grievances she was not present in any of the described incidences PERIOD Foley along with Gothelf opposed the motion for a reelection due to its potential financial impact PERIOD

LoBuono Gonzalez suggested a special board meeting this week to discuss the next steps the board should take and how to address these issues on the table PERIOD

Think about the bigger financial impact LoBuono Gonzalez said PERIOD We do not have enough legal opinion before making decisions. the Student News Site of San Francisco State University
