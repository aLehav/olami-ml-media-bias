8338,2023-10-25,"in  Donald Rumsfeld sparked international controversy by responding to the widespread looting in Iraq with the words stuff happens. little did he know that English playwright David Hare would write a play about the Bush and Blair administrations decision making that led to the war in Iraq and title it just that Stuff Happens. a production of the play which premiered in  at the National Theatre in London opens tonight at the Meadows School of the Arts PERIOD

Hares Stuff Happens goes beyond what most might believe it to be PERIOD The play is neither political satire nor documentary though it does contain real dialogue from the post Sept PERIOD  days PERIOD

Hare describes his most recognized piece as a history play with very recent history in the spotlight PERIOD

For the actors this presented a daunting task portraying characters that are fresh in the minds of the audience PERIOD

Rhonda Blair director of the Meadows production says she helped her student actors with this task by providing them with information on the run up to the U.S PERIOD invasion of Iraq including pertinent U.N and U.S PERIOD documents recommendations for books such as Bob Woodwards State of Denial Bush at War Part III and Michael Isikoffs and David Corns Hubris the Inside Story of the Spin Scandal and the Selling of the Iraq War biographies of the main characters and videos dating from January  to August . senior theater major Durrell Cooper will play Gen PERIOD Collin Powell PERIOD He says he prepared by reading Powells autobiography and watching videos of him speak PERIOD

Bianca Denis junior acting major who will play Condoleezza Rice took another approach PERIOD Denis was able to briefly speak to Rice over the phone through the help of new SMU Vice President of Student Affairs Dr PERIOD Lori White who is a close friend to Rice PERIOD

Even after researching and studying to play these roles the actors also had to deal with the fact that these characters are still being highly criticized PERIOD Senior theater major Carson Alexander will play President George W PERIOD Bush PERIOD

Through all the preparation the cast has done to play these roles they each hope that the message of the play will move the audience PERIOD

This is an event that is still happening PERIOD So if the audience realizes that they dont agree with the decisions made hopefully this play will inspire them to use their power as an American citizen to let their voices be heard says Cooper PERIOD

Denis feels similarly We as the American people have the inalienable right to voice and show our concerns about things that are happening in this country. alexander adds I want the audience to come in with an open mind PERIOD Its important to remember that President Bush is every Americans president PERIOD I think its easy for people to think that because they didnt vote for him they are somehow exempt or not accountable in part for the state of things PERIOD That kind of thinking in the  election could be dangerous for us. because the theme and message of the play are still an obviously hot topic some may not want to deal with it in a theater PERIOD The play though does not seem to take political sides on the continuing war in Iraq PERIOD

Stuff Happens runs Monday through Saturday at  p.m. with shows at  p.m PERIOD on Saturday and Sunday PERIOD The show is being held in the Margo Jones Theatre in the Owen Fine Arts Center PERIOD Tickets are  for adults  for seniors and  for students faculty and staff PERIOD
