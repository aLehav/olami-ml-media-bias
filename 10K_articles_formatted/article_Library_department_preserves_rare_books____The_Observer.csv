Matt Bramanti  Thursday April  

Notre Dame is a university imbued with the past PERIOD Students note  years of coeducation PERIOD Irish faithful boast of the glories of  football seasons PERIOD Domers celebrate the Universitys 162year history PERIOD

But those times pale in comparison to the history contained in the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections tucked away behind tinted glass doors in the concourse of the Hesburgh Library PERIOD

Ben Panciera the rare books curator said some items in the collection date back to the origins of the written word PERIOD

We have collections that span the history of writing beginning with cuneiform Panciera said PERIOD Cuneiform was a type of writing in ancient Mesopotamia beginning about  years ago PERIOD

Panciera is no stranger to old books PERIOD Before taking his current position he worked in the Universitys Medieval Institute then as a cataloguer in the rare books department PERIOD

The department encompasses about  volumes and  medieval and Renaissance manuscripts PERIOD About  of those volumes were printed before  Panciera said PERIOD

He said simple means are used to preserve the books which are surprisingly resistant to deterioration PERIOD

We have extra monitors and precautions for temperature and humidity he said PERIOD And we ensure a completely lightless environment. he said the type of paper used in early printing is more durable than modern paper PERIOD Early books were printed on rag bond  paper made of cotton linen or other textile materials similar to currency PERIOD Modern paper is made of wood pulp treated with acid which destroys the pages over time PERIOD In addition machinebound books dont hold up as well as handmade books Panciera said PERIOD

A pre1830 book is actually a lot more durable than a post1830 book he explained PERIOD

He said that while the departments antique collections are extensive they can be condensed into several specific areas PERIOD

The emphasis is theology the history of Catholic thought English and Irish literature and Renaissance Italy he said PERIOD

The Italian collection includes a unique assembly of works by Florentine poet Dante Alighieri PERIOD

Weve got almost a complete run of the editions of Dantes Divine Comedy from the advent of printing to the seventeenth century Panciera said PERIOD

Several notable scientific works are also housed in the department including works by Copernicus Galileo and Newton PERIOD One of the most prized is a first edition of Copernicus De Revolutionibus in which the astronomer laid out his conception of the heliocentric universe PERIOD The theory was in direct contravention of sixteenth century Catholic teaching which held that the Earth was the center of the universe PERIOD

Only  copies were printed because of the controversy Panciera said PERIOD

The department even has a page from a Gutenberg Bible the first printed book in history PERIOD Panciera said single pages are more common in collections than entire volumes due to the extreme scarcity of intact books PERIOD

He said the last sale of a complete Gutenberg Bible was in the early 1980s when the University of Texas paid . million PERIOD That would be a bargain today PERIOD

My guess is if you bought it today it would cost about  million Panciera said PERIOD If we had a Gutenberg Bible Id be ecstatic. the department also contains an extensive collection of American sports literature and paraphernalia especially nineteenth and twentieth century boxing and wrestling PERIOD Panciera said the sports collection is becoming increasingly relevant for modern researchers PERIOD

Its the sort of stuff scholars would have had much use for until recently he said PERIOD But now its acknowledged that sports is important to American social history. in addition to combative sports the collection also includes a great deal of baseball material PERIOD

We have very extensive records on the AllAmerican Girls Professional Baseball League Panciera said PERIOD The league operated from  and was featured in the  film A League of Their Own. panciera said the department is expanding some of its collections particularly the Latin American and Irish sections PERIOD

Well focus on Argentine historical materials he said PERIOD And our most recent collection is about  Irish novels from the nineteenth and twentieth century. panciera praised the universitys commitment to maintaining its historical materials PERIOD

Its really a collection of national significance Panciera said PERIOD We get people  who travel here just to use the collection. share This Story
