There are very few shows left to be played Club Laga PERIOD Most people will be griping that they There are very few shows left to be played Club Laga PERIOD Most people will be griping that they wanted to see The Darkness there PERIOD Or Saves the Day PERIOD Or Death Cab for Cutie PERIOD Well folks theres one amazing show coming to town that nearly slipped under everyones radar including my own PERIOD This show features The Distillers The Lot Six and one of my personal favorites The Icarus Line PERIOD

The Distillers features the lovely Brody Dalle who was quite the topic of discussion during the past year or so PERIOD She was married to Tim Armstrong and is thus known around the punk community as Brody Armstrong PERIOD However the two had a messy falling out and as of late Brody has been spotted with Nick Oliveri formerly of Queens of the Stone Age PERIOD

But enough about her love life can she rock A resounding Hell yes as her looks are just as appealing as her vocal bite PERIOD The Distillers have been playing for a number of years and they show no signs of slowing down PERIOD

While Coral Fang received many good reviews their big hit was 2002s Sing Sing Death House PERIOD A brutally honest record about how Brodys life went from disastrous to wonderful it shows the true depth of the band PERIOD

The reason that many of you should be there however is The Icarus Line PERIOD Besides containing a member of the Web zine Buddyhead this band will rock your face off PERIOD When asked to describe the vocal stylings of Joe Cardamone I tell others that he sounds like Dave Grohl on the seminal Foo Fighters hit Enough Space. imagine Grohl screaming as he does on that song only all over the place and with even more intensity PERIOD Thats The Icarus Line PERIOD The band rocks doesnt give you any BS and is full of energy and intensity PERIOD

There have been stories about how the band played a show at The House of Blues out in California and Aaron Icarus North who was also a writer at Buddyhead broke a glass case containing Steve Vais guitar PERIOD He then proceeded to plug it in and jam PERIOD The band was immediately ejected from the club PERIOD Theyve apparently also been banned from other clubs in America PERIOD These guys truly know what it means to rock the hell out PERIOD Not only that but they have also been found defaming The Strokes tour bus by spraypainting a large penis on it PERIOD

Can you get any more rock n roll

The Lot Six will also be on the bill bringing a retro indierockwithapunkhybrid sound which is also quite underrated PERIOD Theres nothing more that should stop you from going to a show that should be selling out in every city PERIOD

The Distillers The Icarus Line and The Lost Six will play Club Laga on Sunday PERIOD Doors open at  p.m PERIOD and tickets are  PERIOD Go for a night of great rock with no strings attached PERIOD
