It is that time of the year again PERIOD

Tournament time brings unchartered territory with the stakes that much higher for the Penn State womens hockey team PERIOD

The Nittany Lions begin postseason play this weekend for the third time as a Division I program PERIOD For the first time they will be hosting a series on their home ice at Pegula Ice Arena PERIOD

As a program the Lions took a major step forward this past season finishing . for the first time PERIOD Winners of only four games all of last year expectations are that much higher going into the College Hockey America conference tournament this time around PERIOD

Accomplishing many firsts this season winning a playoff series would be the next major accomplishment PERIOD Learning how to handle being the higher seed and being the favorite could be a challenge though PERIOD Last year Penn State was swept at the hands of the eventual tournament champion RIT PERIOD

Tournament time is exciting coach Josh Brandwene said PERIOD Its that moment when the reset button gets hit for everybody PERIOD Everybodys record is zero and zero and its all about what you do moving forward PERIOD Were really chomping at the bit to get at it. not only are the Lions are a better hockey club this season but there is also more to play for in this years CHA tournament PERIOD

In early October of  the NCAA announced that for the first time in over a decade the CHA winner would be rewarded with an automatic bid to the national tournament PERIOD Prior to the announcement the CHA was the only conference in the country without an automatic bid PERIOD

I think it says a lot about the league Brandwene said PERIOD

Penn State will go into game one of the bestofthree series Friday night losers of their last five games scoring only four goals during that stretch PERIOD Despite the recent failures the thirdyear coach feels his teams confidence is as high as ever saying they have earned the right to be in the position to host a playoff series PERIOD

This is a group that is resilient a group that is battle tested Brandwene said PERIOD They are just chomping at the bit to get after it Friday night and there is nothing better than that. the Lions will get after it against Lindenwood in game one of the series at  p.m PERIOD Friday at Pegula Ice Arena PERIOD
