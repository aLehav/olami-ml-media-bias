7047,2021-03-13,"once the esteemed companions of Egyptian pharaohs greyhounds deserve better than running for their lives  and dogtrack owners couldnt agree more PERIOD

Iowa is one of only seven states in the nation that hasnt outlawed greyhound racing a ludicrous source of gambling revenue PERIOD I find it promising that a recently proposed amendment to Senate File   the online gambling bill as it has become known  seeks to do just that PERIOD Senate Study Bill  would require that licensed dogracing venues pay an annual dog racetrack licensure fee to the gambling commission to discontinue scheduling performances of live dog races. while that may sound antithetical dog track owners have been asking for this for years In  betting on the hounds raked in nearly  million at Dubuques greyhound track in  that profit had dropped to a mere . million according an October article in the Des Moines Register PERIOD An amendment similar to Study Bill  was rejected last year prompting a lawyer for the casino entertainment giant Harrahs to note that they will definitely be pursuing the elimination of greyhound racing. and according to William Petroski of the Register who has been a longtime proponent of ending the races the owners of Council Bluffs Bluffs Run Greyhound Park offered to pay state officials millions of dollars annually for the right to quit offering greyhound races which are poorly attended and have low levels of betting. this is why the study bill also includes provisions that essentially let the tracks off the hook monetarily speaking PERIOD Starting in January   and for sevenstraight years  the tracks in Dubuque and Pottawattamie County would pay  million and  million respectively to not hold races as opposed to the costly subsidization of the betting pool PERIOD This money would instead be put into an Iowa Greyhound Owners and Kennels Retirement Fund to later be distributed among greyhound adopters and state kennels creating a path to complete abolition PERIOD

The bill additionally allows for the televising of outofstate greyhound races at these casinos but this is where the issue gets tricky PERIOD The Dubuque track is working with the Iowa Greyhound Association to start broadcasting their races to other in and outofstate casinos for betting PERIOD This would cost the dog track some  per year  petty change when compared with paying the state not to host the races at all PERIOD

So what are the chances for this amendment not to mention the online gambling bill to be passed this legislative session It may come down to the level of humanitarian or in this instance caninitarian backlash against racing PERIOD The  states that have outlawed live races did so despite how wellcared for the kennels dogs were PERIOD

After all gambling is not particularly beneficial to society though it may help pad the pocketbooks and for every  retired greyhounds at least one is inevitably euthanized usually because of its inability to adapt to regular life or physical disabilities PERIOD

In what other race are the runners required to wear silly jerseys over their legs muzzles over their mouths leap out of boxes and then sprint around in circles chasing electronically controlled bait While I am cognizant that greyhounds are in fact not people something tells me that prohibiting human runners from training prior to  years old calculating in dog years wouldnt hurt their Olympic chances PERIOD

There are only two dogracing tracks in Iowa both of which have helped the state greyhound industry create  kennels and provide  jobs PERIOD In fact Iowa State Universitys Iowa Horse and Dog Breeding Bureau overseen by the proagribusiness Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Services has benefited immensely from the continuance of greyhound racing in the state PERIOD

But when casinos are offering to pay the state millions out of their own pockets to end greyhound racing this should give lawmakers a pretty clear signal that its time to pack up the race is over PERIOD I can only hope that this year the Iowa Legislature will follow in the footsteps of the majority of the country and end dog racing once and for all PERIOD",When racing goes to the dogs - The Daily Iowan,University of Iowa
