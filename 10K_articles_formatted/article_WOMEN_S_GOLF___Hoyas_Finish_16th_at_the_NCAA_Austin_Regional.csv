Jacquelyn Christina and Alexa traveled to every tournament PERIOD That is an accomplishment in itself and they led the squad throughout the year PERIOD Jacquelyn was our frontrunner PERIOD The key to our success was the depth we had on the roster.The team covered each other and we never got complacent Schanuel wrote in an email to The Hoya PERIOD
