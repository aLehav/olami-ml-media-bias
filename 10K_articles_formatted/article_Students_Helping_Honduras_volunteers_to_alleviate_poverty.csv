A group of Towson University students who are part of the nonprofit organization Students Helping Honduras travelled to Honduras to help build schools during this past winter break PERIOD

Towsons chapter of SHH is part of a larger nonprofit organization in the U.S. with about  chapters PERIOD Alex Laue the former copresident of SHH said the groups main goal is to raise money through bake sales thrift shops and other events around campus to build thousands of schools in Honduras PERIOD

Were trying to raise money right now for  more schools Laue said PERIOD As a collective nonprofit at Towson were trying to raise money just for one specific school PERIOD We have a goal of  for the semester PERIOD We are trying to raise our goal so we can contribute to this larger mission of building a thousand schools to help alleviate extreme poverty and gang violence in the country. amanda Sipes the current copresident of SHH first got involved with the organization when she was a freshman PERIOD

For Sipes her most memorable experience in Honduras as a freshman was meeting Katherine a local kid in the community where they were working at PERIOD

After finishing up at the work site on our way back to the hostel where the volunteers stayed all of the kids just rushed over to us and they were so excited and happy to meet us she said PERIOD They just wanted to play with us and become our friends PERIOD This girl came up to me and she hugged me PERIOD Her name was Katherine PERIOD The entire week we hung out every single day after the work site she would be waiting for me to come out so we could play together. sipes said the experience turned into a lasting bond between her and Katherine PERIOD

It was the most amazing experience that I had just met this girl and we had formed such a close bond Sipes said PERIOD It helps because I speak Spanish we could connect by that but it was just so amazing that we got to spend every single day of the week together PERIOD When I came back the following year she recognized me and that was my favorite part. laura Sullam the groups vice president explained how the trip during winter break was a new experience for her as a trip leader PERIOD Sullam said she has been over to Honduras a total of four times  three during the winter and one during the summer  but that this was the first time she had stayed more than a week PERIOD

It was definitely different because not only was I with Towson people on the week that they were there but I got to trip lead the chapters from other schools and meet a lot of the new volunteers Sullam said PERIOD

Sullam said the main volunteer trip is typically on the work site where the students work for several hours during the day under the hot sun PERIOD

We wake up we have breakfast together and we go to the work site she said PERIOD The work site is different depending on what school you are so typically the school youre raising money for is the work site youll be working on PERIOD Then well eat lunch have the afternoon to work and we have fun activities. after a long days work Sullam said the group gets to consider the days events and unwind with local residents PERIOD

Well do reflections at night she said PERIOD We have a night where we go to the soccer field to play soccer and we always play with the kids in the communities. although this was the set routine for Sullam and the other student volunteers she said each trip is different giving volunteers a unique experience each time PERIOD

Its really different every time you go because you cant predict what will work how the schedule will change and it teaches you to become very flexible and openminded with anything that could be possibly thrown at you she said PERIOD

Sipes and her fellow SHH members agreed that the organization has been progressing every single year PERIOD

Were continuously raising more money were getting more people to come down more people passionate and involved she said PERIOD

As for the future goals of SHH Laue Sipes and Sullam all agreed that they want to bring more awareness to the organization and make their cause known to not only Towson University but the surrounding community and other schools in the area PERIOD

When people that are close to us  like family or friends that we have here  when they see how passionate we are I think its evident that its a great organization and its sustainable Sullam said PERIOD I think spreading awareness is the next step whether it be friends our age or to anybody that could help us spread the word. more information can be found by going to the organizations website SHHKids.org which includes testimonials from participants and how to get involved PERIOD
