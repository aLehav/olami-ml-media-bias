8463,2023-11-05,"p PERIOD While at first glance the Colleges slight slip in the annual U.S PERIOD News and World Report rankings of the nations best universities may seem discouraging there are several areas in which the College improved markedly and the statistics themselves still suggest that the College is highly competitive in relation to other public and private universities PERIOD

p PERIOD While we feel it is not our place to judge the merits of Lehigh and Brandeis Universities  the two schools that replaced the College as the thirty-first best school in the country  we feel that the College remains one of the very top schools in the country and underrated by the criteria used by U.S PERIOD News PERIOD The Colleges particularly strong alumni giving rank  tied with the University of Virginia as one of the highest for a public school  reminds us of the strong ties College students feel with their alma mater PERIOD

p PERIOD Despite receiving an overall rank of    spots lower than U.Va PERIOD  a convincing case can still be made that the College is the most selective doctoralgranting university in Virginia PERIOD The Colleges  percent acceptance rate is five points lower than U.Va.s and its SAT range remains  points higher PERIOD Lower facultytostudent ratios and a strong graduation and retention ranking also place the College at the top of Virginias institutions of higher learning PERIOD

p PERIOD We hope that our readers recognize that while the Colleges rank may be falling the sky certainly isnt PERIOD
