Katie Lou Samuelson played a key role in the teams win over SMU Nicholas HamptonThe Daily Campus

Oh boy the Pro Bowl is this weekend I cant wait to watch it said no one ever PERIOD

Lets face it the Pro Bowl is definitely the worst of the professional allstar games and the NHL AllStar Game isnt much better PERIOD Since both are this weekend there is little or no action in either of their respective leagues this week PERIOD

But fear not as I have a list of basketball games that you will not want to miss in the upcoming days both for college and the NBA PERIOD

By the way if you genuinely enjoy the Pro Bowl andor the NHL AllStar Game Im not judging you but Im kind of judging you PERIOD

NCAAM Arizona Wildcats vs PERIOD USC Trojans

Thursday Jan PERIOD   p.m PERIOD on FS1

This is definitely an undertheradar game as neither team is ranked but you wont find two more evenly matched teams PERIOD

Arizona enters the game in second place in the Pac12 with a  record overall and a  record in conference PERIOD Meanwhile USC is  overall and  in the Pac12 PERIOD Both teams have wins over Cal and Stanford but losses to Oregon PERIOD Both teams are also coming off of wins Arizona over Oregon State and USC over UCLA PERIOD

USC has a slightly better offense averaging  points per game to Arizonas  while Arizonas defense allows just  points per game to USCs  PERIOD

Im looking forward to seeing the top guards for both teams battling it out PERIOD Both Brandon Randolph for Arizona and Jonah Matthews for USC have multiple  point games this season and have the ability to carry their teams if needed PERIOD

This should be an entertaining downtothewire game that will definitely be worth tuning in for PERIOD

NBA Toronto Raptors vs PERIOD Houston Rockets

Friday Jan PERIOD   p.m PERIOD on ESPN

It doesnt get much better than this PERIOD Its the team with the most wins in the league vs PERIOD this seasons MVP James Harden so far and its happening Friday night PERIOD

The Raptors have been unbelievable this season PERIOD Kawhi Leonard has been a beast averaging over  points per game and almost eight rebounds per game PERIOD His presence has allowed Kyle Lowry to become a true point guard and better passer PERIOD He is averaging a career high . assists per game PERIOD Not to mention guys like Serge Ibaka and Pascal Siakam have been fantastic this year PERIOD

The Raptors have a lot going for them but the one thing they dont have is James Harden PERIOD Harden is making a very convincing case for backtoback MVP seasons averaging almost  points eight rebounds and eight assists per game PERIOD The last time he scored under  was way back on Dec PERIOD  when he scored  PERIOD Also dont forget that Clint Capela is a monster on the boards averaging over  per game PERIOD

These teams should match up well and provide us with some mustwatch basketball PERIOD

NCAAM  Kansas Jayhawks vs PERIOD  Kentucky Wildcats

Saturday Jan PERIOD   p.m PERIOD on ESPN

The two winningest Division I mens basketball programs of all time PERIOD  combined NCAA Tournament appearances  combined Final Fours and  combined National Championships PERIOD Dick Vitale must be going nuts about this matchup PERIOD The storylines really write themselves for this one PERIOD

These two teams seem to be great every single year and this season is no different PERIOD Both teams are ranked in the top  with nearly identical  Kansas and  Kentucky records PERIOD John Calipari and Bill Self are two of the best to ever coach and once again theyve put their teams in positions for high seeds in March PERIOD

As far as the players go Dedric Lawson for Kansas and P.J PERIOD Washington for Kentucky are the top players to watch PERIOD They are the leaders of their respective teams and are good allaround players PERIOD

If you love college basketball you have to love this matchup PERIOD If the result on the floor is even half as good as the buildup its going to be a very fun game PERIOD

NCAAW UCF Knights vs PERIOD  UConn Huskies

Sunday Jan PERIOD   p.m PERIOD on ESPN 

I shouldnt have to tell UConn fans to watch a UConn womens basketball game PERIOD It should be a given PERIOD However this game should be better than most PERIOD

UConn has a  record right now which is great but UCF isnt far behind at  PERIOD Both teams are also undefeated in conference play PERIOD

I dont think this will be a runofthemill UConn game where they get out to a 30point halftime lead and cruise to a win PERIOD

Kay Kay Wright is one of the best players in the conference averaging over  points four rebounds and almost four assists per game all of which lead UCF PERIOD Obviously we know plenty about the threeheaded monster of Napheesa Collier Katie Lou Samuelson and Crystal Dangerfield for UConn PERIOD

As far as womens basketball games go you wont find too many better than this one PERIOD
