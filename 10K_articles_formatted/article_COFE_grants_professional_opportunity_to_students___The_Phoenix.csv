8909,2016-09-29,"three current Swarthmore students began the Chamber Orchestra First Editions Sunday Performance at Lang Concert Hall by conducting one of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts pieces PERIOD Although another conductor would orchestrate the other pieces that night the three students Aaron Slepoi  Andrew Kim  and Shira SamuelsShragg  conducted not only an orchestra consisting of professionals and advanced music students but the opening piece of the night PERIOD

The hall was engulfed by murmurs as the last of the spectators of the event shuffled in clutching their pamphlets the ushers handed them on the way in and they hesitantly selected their seats with respect to the space and people around them PERIOD Quickly the sound of instruments tuning up immediately silenced the murmur PERIOD All mouths were shushed and all eyes gazed upon the stage PERIOD

Its hard for me not to have stage fright because I am an anxious person by nature but I was fine PERIOD The only way to get a good performance is to relax and forget the audience  I am not performing at all or doing anything for the audience what I am doing is for the musicians said Slepoi PERIOD

After a brief introduction of the nights events Kim emerged PERIOD At the pedestal his body was symmetrical except for the baton in his hand PERIOD The room was motionless as the audience was in captivation and the players in concentration PERIOD Kim then broke symmetry and began to conduct PERIOD The silence was killed as it had done to its preceding murmur with only the sounds of the music and respiration remaining PERIOD

The Chamber Orchestra First Editions conducted by former Daniel Underhill Professor Emeritus of Music and CoDirector of the Swarthmore Music  Dance Festival James Freeman is a group of composers performers and renowned guest soloists who play pieces by Mozart and current Philadelphiaarea composers PERIOD The orchestra is made up of Philadelphia freelance players and some advanced string players from Swarthmore Haverford and Bryn Mawr PERIOD The concerts are free and open to the public and also offer space for informal interactions between performers and the audience PERIOD

Slepoi Kim and SamuelsShragg each conducted a portion of Serenata Notturna in D K PERIOD  by Mozart PERIOD Kim conducted first the movement titled Marcia Maestoso followed by Shragg conducting Menuetto and Slepoi conducting Rondeau Allegretto PERIOD When finished all three students returned to the stage received a standing ovation with the orchestra by nearly the entire crowd and took their bows PERIOD The concert then proceeded conducted by Freeman with pieces written by Arne Running who unfortunately passed this year and Janice Hamer PERIOD The concert concluded with Marcantonio Barone head of the piano department at the Bryn Mawr Conservatory of Music playing a piano concerto in E flat Major K PERIOD  PERIOD

I learned a great deal from working with them the Chamber Orchestra Kim commented after Sunday nights performance PERIOD Their enthusiastic and friendly attitude towards music allowed me to feel very comfortable and to engage with the music to the fullest. slepoi recalled how he received a letter back in May from Freeman asking if he wished to conduct one of the performances PERIOD Freeman had previously asked Andrew Hauze the director of Swarthmore Colleges College Orchestra and Wind Ensemble for recommendations of conductors for a performance PERIOD Despite the long span between the offer and the opportunity to perform as well as the difficulty to prepare ahead Slepoi immediately took the offer PERIOD

If someone asks you to conduct something you never say no PERIOD Figure out the logistics later opportunity is not a lengthy visitor said Slepoi PERIOD Opportunities exist to conduct professionals but to rehearse with professional musicians is extraordinarily unusual PERIOD To have this program exist at all is an outstanding privilege PERIOD To have this program exist at all is an outstanding privilege. your email address will not be published PERIOD
