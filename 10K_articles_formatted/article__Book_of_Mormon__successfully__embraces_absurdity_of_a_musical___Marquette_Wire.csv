3269,2023-11-04,"in general musicals are larger than life ridiculous and inherently unrealistic PERIOD In the real world people dont break into song and dance PERIOD The magic of the musical pulls people in PERIOD Book of Mormon does this in unparalleledways PERIOD

Book of Mormon follows two missionaries Elder Price Gabe Gibbs and Elder Cunningham Cody Jamison Strandas they embark on their first mission in Uganda PERIOD Price is less than thrilled with his placement and bails after a few short days PERIOD Cunningham is able to grab the attention of the originally unreceptive African people PERIOD However he has a problem with lying and lies about different aspects of his religion PERIOD These lies ultimately lead the people to conversion PERIOD

Later on when church leaders come to congratulate the Elders on their progress they are disgraced with the lies these people have taken as truth PERIOD They tell the missionaries to pack their bags but they decide to stay PERIOD Inthe end they are truly unified with the people of Uganda who accept the lies they were told as metaphors to learn from PERIOD

Throughout the show there are numerousinnuendos and politically incorrect jokes that got the audience laughing PERIOD Going into this show remembering the general absurdity of musicals is important PERIOD Hopefully no rightminded person would repeatthe vast majority of things said in the show PERIOD

Some of these jokes were clever PERIOD There wasan entire songBaptize Me that usedbaptism as a sexual innuendo which was surprisingly well done although quite explicit PERIOD

While the song itself was clever Strand and Candace Quarrels who played Nabulungi each had beautiful and strong voices PERIOD Gibbs showcased his musical gifts in his solo songs as well PERIOD None of the three leads lost their character in their music maintaining the integrity of the performance PERIOD

Elder Price was the epitome of a star student PERIOD He held high expectations for himself and those around him PERIOD His many mood swings from excitement despair to fear and hope were shown in strong facials and tones PERIOD

Elder Cunningham embodied a traditional underdog PERIOD The charactermessedupcountless times but kepthis head high PERIOD Strand created a lovable over the top character with a strong stage presence and deliberate body language PERIOD

Body language was a key factor as Strand danced his way through Man Up. while this showcased the performances quality it was also an incredibly excitingscene Brian MacDevitt.Neon lights made the audience feel like they were at a concert while Elder Cunningham had a rockstar moment PERIOD Disco balls glittered reflective lights across the audience PERIOD

However at times the neon lights against the white costumes became very strong and somewhat painful to look at PERIOD This was brief and did not deter from the quality of the other elements of the show PERIOD

Vibrant lights shone through the set during the whole show PERIOD The proscenium was formedby a modern Mormon temple PERIOD Rays of light glistened in the gaps adding to the moodof each scene whether it took placeSalt Lake City or Hell PERIOD

The set Scott Park overall was impressive and set changes were fluid and nondisruptive PERIOD This contributed to how easy it was to follow the show PERIOD

Costumes Ann Roth were reflective of each character and the amount of work put towardsproperly representing each demographic was obvious PERIOD While costume changes were scarce a large group of Mormon missionaries were able to add pink sequined vests to their ensemble almost instantaneously PERIOD Likely the most stand out costume it added to the creativity and humor of the well choreographed tap dance during Turn it Off. the tap dance was in sync and each dancer had a strong sense of musicality PERIOD Their strong performance translated over to all of the other dance numbers but Turn it Off was easily most impressive PERIOD

Overall Book of Mormon will keep you smilingperhaps make your jawdrop and ruthlessly entertain you in a welltimed and wellexecuted show PERIOD Just be sure to go in with an open mind PERIOD

The show runs through Oct PERIOD  at the Marcus Center for Performing Arts PERIOD
