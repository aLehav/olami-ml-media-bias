9352,2017-09-04,"make sure youre nice and cozy when you sit down to watch Netflixs new original comedy series Disjointed PERIOD With legalization on the rise across the U.S. Disjointed supports the growing normalization of cannabis use in fun and informative ways PERIOD Cocreated by Chuck Lorre responsible The Big Bang Theory and producer David Javerbaum former writer of the Daily Show the 10episode season released on Aug PERIOD twenty-fifth surprisingly feels a lot like a sitcom you would see on network television but with a lot more freedom to use profanity and other language that can catch you off guard at first PERIOD

The series centers on Ruth Whitefeather Feldman played by veteran actress and star of the show Kathy Bates PERIOD Feldman is the owner of the Southern California wellness center Ruths Alternative Caring and runs it alongside her son Travis played by Aaron Moten and other employees at the shop PERIOD Feldman is a former marijuana activist who fought hard for the legalization of the plant for many years and has been in and out of jail as a consequence PERIOD As a result of this Travis feels like his mother has not always been there for him and believes she loves the plant more than her own son PERIOD The two frequently clash heads over how to run the center with Travis viewing it as good business opportunity to expand and Ruth totally appalled by the idea of marijuana industrialization PERIOD

The main characters in the show go through personal issues and face emotional truths which are brought forth and alleviated with the use of cannabis and the comfort of their peers PERIOD The centers security guard Carter played by Tone Bell has recently returned from a military deployment and struggles coping with his PTSD PERIOD Although reluctant to try cannabis at first hes ready to take on the world again after his first use PERIOD Through his mind the show depicts what it feels like to be under the influence through the use of mesmerizing psychedelic animations PERIOD Glimpses into different characters thoughts and imaginations really capture what it feels like to drift off into your mind during just about any situation PERIOD The writers also address small truths and stigmatisms about cannabis in the dialogue between characters while the actors do a wonderful job of portraying stoners making you wonder if they are actually high PERIOD

Throughout most of the series Ruth and her employees are rather elevated influencing the amount of jokes pertaining to the plant PERIOD The humor can be really funny at times but can also come off a little dry and somewhat difficult to understand for people who do not partake in the culture PERIOD Supporting characters like Dank played by Chris Redd and Dabby played by Betsy Sodaro fully play into the pot makes you stupid stereotype in a ridiculous fashion that keeps your glossy eyes glued to the screen PERIOD While the shows Strain O the Day segments put the spotlight on different strains that are available at Ruths dispensary some very real and others laughably fake PERIOD On another note there are a lot of racial stereotypes applied to the AsianAmerican character Jenny Elizabeth Ho more so than any other character

The producers really bring the traditional sitcom feel to Netflix with the use of laugh tracks and amusing little commercials advertising different pot related products the show mimic advertising breaks as you would see on regular network television PERIOD
