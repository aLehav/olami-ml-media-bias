2822,2009-04-02,"a Wisconsin Congressman introduced an alternative federal budget Wednesday in an effort counteract the budget proposal introduced by President Barack Obama PERIOD

According to a report by the Republican Caucus and the Committee on the budget the Republican Budget Alternative introduced by House Budget Committee member Paul Ryan RJanesville would spend . trillion less than the Democratic budget plan borrow . trillion less than proposed by the Obama administration not increase taxes create . million more jobs than the budget proposed by Democrats and increase funding for defense and veterans PERIOD

Republicans must not only act to stop this disastrous course but offer the American people a better choice Ryan said in a statement PERIOD Our budget alternative provides a path out of our current crises  by restoring economic growth and job creation controlling spending and deficits  and by lifting the crushing burden of dent and taxes from future generations. the Republican Party of Wisconsin is also in support of Ryans proposal according to spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski PERIOD

The alternative budget proposed by Congressmen Ryan today keeps the promises that Obama made during his campaign that he has since backtracked on Kukowski said PERIOD

She added the president promised tax cuts and instead provided only more spending and increased deficit that will be passed on for future generations only harming the economy in the long run PERIOD

Democrats and officials in the Obama administration are skeptical of the plan however PERIOD

According to Rob Nabors deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget the bill is unlikely to repeal the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act or stand up in the long run with its continuation of former president George W PERIOD Bush administrations economic policies PERIOD

I dont think that this was designed as a real plan that could be implemented in this country  I think what it is really is a series of talking points that they were hoping no one would actually look behind Nabors said PERIOD

He added the Republican proposal including a measure to turn Medicare into a voucher program would greatly harm the economy by increasing healthcare costs at a time when reducing healthcare costs is the most important way for the federal government to reduce its current deficit PERIOD

Nabors also criticized the Republican proposal for rescinding the  appropriation bills and freezing discretionary spending which would greatly reduce Pell Grants PERIOD

Wisconsin Congressman Ron Kind DLa Crosse agreed with Nabors assessment of the plan PERIOD

The budget proposal offered by House Republicans not only undermines our shortterm recovery but also threatens our longterm prosperity Kind said in an email to The Badger Herald PERIOD Cutting education funding by  billion does not help our economy recover or keep American businesses competitive with China and India. this article was published Apr   at  am and last
