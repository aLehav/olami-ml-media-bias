Halloween is almost here and CapMetro is ready to take you and your friends out for a ghoulish good time PERIOD Before you head to your favorite costume contest or TexasBaylor watch party make sure you know the service schedule that will get you there and home safely PERIOD

On Saturday night MetroRail and MetroRapid will run until midnight PERIOD For the late night vampires hanging downtown for the evening Night Owls will run until about  A.M. and will depart from sixth and Congress PERIOD If youre going back to the campus area or North Lamar take the Night Owl  whereas the Night Owl  serves Riverside PERIOD

Normally Night Owls dont run on Sundays but they will on Halloween night and MetroRapid will also run until about midnight but there wont be MetroRail service PERIOD Dont forget that its a school night and the Cowboys also play that evening PERIOD
