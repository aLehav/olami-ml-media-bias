1961,2023-11-04,"miley Cyrus much discussed VMA performance will soon be remembered as an event on par with other infamous pop music moments PERIOD It was rude crude and not exactly deep PERIOD But one thing is for sure  it has cemented an iconic image of Cyrus in our minds for better or for worse PERIOD

The previously generic long brown hair and forgettable outfits of last years Cyrus have been replaced by the gyrating latex bikiniclad platinum blonde pixie cut in platform sneakers PERIOD This signature outfit will be mocked for years worn as a Halloween costume and inexorably linked with Cyrus  and thats exactly how Cyrus has cracked the code of the pop music game PERIOD

Although some would mourn the current state of the music business it is an inarguable fact that in the pop genre today selling music equates to selling shock value PERIOD It doesnt matter that Cyrus was offkey and danced poorly PERIOD What matters is that Cyrus generated a conversation that lasted weeks PERIOD Now Cyrus has a look that can only be imitated never shared PERIOD Any teenage girl can have long brown hair but now only Miley Cyrus walks on stage with a perpetually stuckout tongue and a teddyprinted onepiece PERIOD

Since the rise of the music video mainstream music has become as much about what the audience sees as what the audience hears PERIOD Madonna was the first chameleonlike performer to master the visual shockvalue strategy that has kept her relevant despite her albums few hits PERIOD

Rihanna has imitated this strategy  first separating herself from her RB peers with a sleek bob haircut in the Umbrella era and continually changing her hair and look in the years since PERIOD

This pop diva caricature is not as simple as a string of evolving haircuts however  Lady Gagas name conjures up images of surreal meat outfits and performance art ensembles PERIOD Katy Perry brings to mind candycolored cupcake bikinis PERIOD Keha is perpetually clad in tornapart shorts and golden glitter PERIOD

These artists each have their own devoted fan bases and carefully cultivated unique images to go along with them PERIOD In a pop music era in which the visual matters as much as the songs do Cyrus is well on her way to carving out her own image for her loyal Smilers fan base whether the rest of the music world likes it or not PERIOD
