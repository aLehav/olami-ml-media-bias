Maxwells which is located at  Wall St PERIOD in downtown Morgantown has been closed since December  PERIOD

To many peoples disappointment Maxwells a restaurant located at  Wall Street in downtown Morgantown has been closed for the two months as landlord and tenant find themselves in a dispute over unpaid rent PERIOD

It all started Dec PERIOD   when Maxwells owner John Lichter arrived at the restaurant to open up for another day of business PERIOD

According to Lichter he was surprised to find the locks switched and he had to keep the restaurant closed for the day PERIOD

Two months later Maxwells remains closed  leaving bills unpaid food to rot and employees without a job to go to PERIOD

Lichter said he didnt want to go into detail about what caused the disagreement pending the outcome of a magistrate court date scheduled for Tuesday but he said hes hopeful the restaurant will reopen shortly PERIOD

So far the consensus seems to be that we were illegally closed Lichter said PERIOD Our goal is to reopen Maxwells as soon as possible for the same reason we bought it in the first place PERIOD We want students to enjoy the experience and great food my wife and I enjoyed when we were students and Maxwells was new. lichter leased the restaurant in summer  and said he invested more than  in his new business PERIOD

BMT the leasing company that owns the building put out an ad on Craigslist Dec PERIOD   looking to sell the restaurant for  PERIOD

According to a man who identified himself as the landlord but refused to give out his name Lichter never paid rent and he claims the eviction was according to protocol PERIOD

I think he owes  or  different vendors money for the work they did on his place and he didnt pay them the landlord said PERIOD

The landlord also said Lichter recently dropped the civil case and he will be moving his things out of therestaurant shortly PERIOD

I have a letter from his attorneys to my attorney that says that everything is done the landlord said PERIOD He just wants to pick a couple of things up and then hes done so there is no court PERIOD He might not have gotten notified yet thats it. lichter said the landlords statement is false and the case is still scheduled to go to court at . p.m PERIOD Tuesday PERIOD

Lichters information was later confirmed by Morgantown Magistrate Court PERIOD

Whether the 37yearold restaurant will ever open its doors again remains uncertain but it seems as if customers looking for answers can expect them within the near future PERIOD
