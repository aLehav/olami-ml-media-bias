Cage the Elephants third LP Melophobia takes us on a journey into the mind of the bands lead singer Matthew Shultz PERIOD Known mainly for their chaotic combinations of punk blues and garage rock their latest album displays many different sides to the band highlighted by experimental combinations of various elements and genres of music PERIOD

Telescope sees Shultz losing the role of lyricist and stepping into the role of storyteller PERIOD The mellow guitar melodies and melancholy vocals paint a picture of a former self and of regret at letting time slip by PERIOD He warns Time is like a leaf in the wind  Its either time well spent or time well wasted  Dont waste it. once the break hits Shultzs lyrics break down as well chanting Im alone  Im alone  Cant you see Unlike past songs most fans are accustomed to Shultz brings down his personal barriers and places himself fully into the song his lyrics connect with the rhythm PERIOD

Its Just Forever featuring Alison Mosshart of The Kills is a departure from Cage the Elephants previous sound PERIOD The song finds the pair singing over hypnotizing guitar and piano melodies and hardbacking drums PERIOD The track begins innocently enough but is filled with darker lyrics as Shultz croons Ill love you til we decompose and the skin falls off our bones. once Mossharts verse comes around the song becomes increasingly twisted as she instantly takes control and sings Give me your heart like a hole in the head over gritty grunge guitar riffs PERIOD Though more cringeworthy the song is a definitely a highlight of the album PERIOD

The standout track of the album is its single Come A Little Closer. here the band completely flips the script of what is expected of a song from Cage the Elephant PERIOD Instead of just another loud track the band takes a minimalistic and slower approach PERIOD Shultzs distorted vocals do exactly what the title suggests pulling the listener in deeper as the song gradually picks up PERIOD Once the chorus hits the track crescendos and Shultz passionately sings Come a little closer then youll see  Things arent always what they seem to be. over moving guitar strums and pounding kickdrums he reflects on hard times and the pain of being misunderstood PERIOD As the song breaks down he chants Time flies by  They all sing along inspiring listeners to chant alongside Shultz PERIOD

Cigarette Daydreams the albums ending track reflects the bands much lighter side and bright future ahead of them PERIOD At the end of an album filled with many opposing genres and styles Cage the Elephant once again mixes things up and chooses to end with an acoustic track PERIOD Powered by carefree guitar melodies Shultzs lyricism comes into full bloom as he sings hopefully We can find a reason  A reason to change  Looking for the answers. embracing the regrets of lost time mentioned in Telescope the track shows that the band still has more to give both sonically and lyrically PERIOD

Melophobia is a step in the right direction for Cage the Elephant and a necessary improvement from 2011s Thank You Happy Birthday. both the band and Matthew Shultz moved out of their comfort zones implementing different genres of music and reframing their sound and lyrical content PERIOD While a couple of the songs on the album were hitormiss due in part to vague lyrics or unrefined sounds Melophobia shows that while the band still has a ways to go they are headed on the right path PERIOD It is definitely an album worth listening to PERIOD
