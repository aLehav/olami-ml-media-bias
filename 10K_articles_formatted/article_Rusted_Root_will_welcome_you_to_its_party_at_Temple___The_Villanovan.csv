The title of Rusted Roots latest album Welcome To My Party offers an inviting and stimulating feeling just as the music offers the same engaging and exhilarating emotion PERIOD The 11track album offers a happy medium between a dance mix and the organic Rusted Root sound said lead singer and songwriter Michael Glabicki PERIOD I got a chance to catch up with Glabicki as we talked about the new album and tour that will hit up Temple University on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Rusted Root kicked off its summer opening for Santana with a 20date tour that ran through Aug PERIOD  PERIOD It was a positive experience for Glabicki who said of the platinumselling artist Hes a very gracious and open person PERIOD Kind of like a teacher and a friend. glabicki also mentions other rock idols that have joined Rusted Roots repertoire of collaborations including his favorite Robert Plant of Led Zepplin because of his humbleness and curiosity for music  thats where a lot of the magic comes from. and you can also count Radioheads Kid A Neil Young and Rust Never Sleeps as personal listening favorites PERIOD

Rusted Root is presently headlining a monthandahalf long trek across America which will have Mike Doughty of Soul Coughing opening PERIOD

The tradition before each show consists of Glabicki going on stage for a few minutes ahead of time checking out the crowd and having a sip of beer so that he can calm his nerves and get a feel for the venue PERIOD

He claims that every crowd it plays for has different energy PERIOD Some are relaxed and close their eyes while others get really excited PERIOD Each night is a new challenge. as he takes a minute to observe the reaction of his fans he notices some crying and others laughing PERIOD I just get tuned into the music and react to it through myself and I take the audience as an extension of myself PERIOD Whatever they feel is fine with me PERIOD Im not trying to make them feel any certain way. after a show the group usually goes to a booth off stage to sign souvenirs and meet with fans PERIOD Most people approach me in a very cool way but I dont worry about it too much. the most bizarre comment he has ever heard came from a girl who asked Can I have your baby

After taking a oneyear hiatus the band worked together to create a combination of harmonious sounds based on unique cultural influences each member brought back from their time off PERIOD However they had a slight problem that most bands would dream of there were too many ideas PERIOD I felt like I had to step in and take a director role and figure out when to say no said Glabicki PERIOD Everybody has such a strong opinion  every decision on where to eat or even sleep becomes a group meeting he joked PERIOD

Glabickis favorite song from the new CD is Hands are Law. he elaborated on a few other songs explaining that they have personal meaning behind them PERIOD The song Artificial Winter has lyrics that make a reference to a man and his child saying A father cries out into the night As his child slips away The door shuts as the boy Reaches that forbidden road. glabicki shared a personal story behind the meaning of the words involving the relationship between him and his father PERIOD The song begins as a process of flushing out the mental projection from his father concerning his disapproval for his sons career in music PERIOD

Glabicki said in a melancholy tone My father did what his father wanted him to do but after he saw me do what I wanted to do against his will he decided to do what he really wanted to do. his father had leukemia the last  years of his life but during the last two he quit his job as a plumber and followed his dream to become a golf instructor PERIOD He died two years ago but they shared a common bond the determination to follow a dream PERIOD

Another new song Blue Diamonds is an emotional song about Glabickis vision of a celestial being. he saw her after being hit by a car at a young age and again when he hurt his arm in a construction project PERIOD He remembered her from the first encounter and said pensively that it was a very comfortable and familiar feeling PERIOD This song is a love song to her. your donation will support the student journalists of The Villanovan with technological needs training etc
