Freshman first baseman Jordan Browers head might bear the scars of an injury from an accident but this is not a story of pain and suffering PERIOD This is a story of recovery PERIOD

The only time I cried in the hospital was because I didnt get to see any of my team Brower said PERIOD

In Cal Polys game against Missouri on Feb PERIOD  Brower was struck in the head with a baseball bat while standing in the dugout hospitalizing him for five days  with two spent in the intensive care unit ICU PERIOD

Since then Brower has been cleared to practice but not play PERIOD His full recovery will involve at the least a stoppage of internal bleeding in the brain a headache free week and a second concussion test PERIOD Although he appears to be two thirds of the way there doctors said Brower is still a couple months from getting back on the field PERIOD

It was a freak accident to say the least PERIOD Freshman first baseman Tim Wise was swinging a bat in the on deck circle during a rain delay in the Mustangs second game of the season PERIOD Wise lost his grip and the bat ricocheted into the dugout  where it hit Brower in the head PERIOD

The team might have stood around in shock after Brower dropped to the ground but their real influence came in the days and weeks following PERIOD

Any time one of our of guys goes down especially in a scary situation were going to try and rally around him junior shortstop Mike Miller said PERIOD Hes just done a great job coming back PERIOD When something like that happens youre concerned not even as a baseball player but just a person PERIOD That could have changed his life completely. from the first moments after the injury the team made a conscious effort to aid his recovery by any means PERIOD That is what meant most to Brower even if he cannot remember it PERIOD

Reed Reilly a freshman pitcher and Browers roommate was away when the incident occurred PERIOD He said he received text messages from Browers brother that appeared to indicate that Brower was in serious condition PERIOD So as a friend and teammate on his way back to San Luis Obispo Reilly stopped by the hospital and sat at Browers bedside to keep him company for five hours PERIOD

Brower would wake up briefly and talk to Reilly for a few fleeting moments then settle back into his pillow before awakening again to ask the same questions and give the same responses PERIOD

I tried to keep it as mellow as possible Reilly said PERIOD So we talked about school and baseball  It was really repetitive. after a few days Brower had recovered enough to be released from the hospital and taken to his home in Newbury Park Calif PERIOD where he remained for nearly three weeks PERIOD

Almost every day Brower would Skype or text a teammate from San Luis Obispo as they checked on his progress like any family would PERIOD A bond that head coach Larry Lee has been impressed with this year PERIOD

Weve had a really good culture in our team the last few years Lee said PERIOD Were very tight knit and its important PERIOD They enjoy being around each other so that part of the equation has been good. and that equation has added up to a steadily recovering Brower who attributes his success in overcoming a fractured skull and nagging headaches to his team PERIOD

However upon returning to Cal Poly Brower was hit by the reality that comes with being a studentathlete PERIOD Finals week was approaching and Browers professors were only somewhat receptive to his pleas for more time PERIOD

One professor he said based his grade  percent on the final exam and his solution to Browers missed time was to find more people to study with PERIOD

So Brower did just that and earned a solid B after missing more than  percent of class PERIOD Another professor gave Brower an additional three weeks into spring quarter to finish a final essay in what he saw as a just extension PERIOD

Yet its not just classes that Brower is back in just six weeks after the accident he is back on the baseball diamond in a limited role PERIOD

Right when I got back I had to wear a helmet in the dugout when I played catch when I hit Brower said PERIOD The doctors were really cautious. recently hes shed the helmet except for when batting and the team has seen his desire to return to life as usual on the field PERIOD

Its been one of those things where hes been trying to get back and the doctors keep telling him Gotta slow down gotta slow down Miller said PERIOD

But with a summertime clearance coming up for Brower hes ready to play ball in Oregon and get back to his normal baseballfilled life PERIOD Gone are the fears that gripped the players in the immediate aftermath replaced with a feeling that all will be better soon PERIOD

It could have been a very tragic story Miller said PERIOD But the way its working out now its going to be a positive recovery and hes going to get a chance to come back out and play the game he loves. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
