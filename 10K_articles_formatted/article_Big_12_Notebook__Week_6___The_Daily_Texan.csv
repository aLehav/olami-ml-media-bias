Officiating in West Virginia vs PERIOD Oklahoma game

One week after flagging Texas  times referee Alan Eck and his crew were at it again during Oklahomas game against West Virginia on Saturday PERIOD The Sooners and Mountaineers combined for  penalties and  yards during Oklahomas  win PERIOD Eck and crew threw even more flags this time around with Oklahoma taking  penalties and West Virginia taking the remaining  PERIOD Of note among the flags however was an illegal wedge call on Oklahoma on a kickoff in the third quarter PERIOD The call which prohibits two or more players lining up shouldertoshoulder to block on a kickoff is a rarely made call PERIOD Still Sooners head coach Bob Stoops wasnt worried about the number of flags from Ecks goal PERIOD
