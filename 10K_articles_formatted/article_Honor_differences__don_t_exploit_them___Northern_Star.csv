Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Gina QuiliciJanuary  

Just when you thought it was safe to read the editorial page again you saw that same familiar mugshot PERIOD Yes its me PERIOD Im back and Im fiesty as ever PERIOD You lovely people get to enjoy another semester of my quick wit and light banter highlighted by a gentle touch of sarcasm PERIOD So if the screams of elation have subsided we will move on to todays lesson PERIOD

As most of you have hopefully noticed we have entered the 1990sa whole new decade lies ahead of us just waiting to be shaped and formed PERIOD But before setting a course for the future in stone we need to take a look at exactly what we as a people have accomplished in the past PERIOD Note the dream sequence beginning. for centuries we battled against the archaic rules of our forefathers that bound us to a dreary existence PERIOD Finally after years of unspeakable torture we emerged victorious from the fight with a whole new list of freedoms to enjoy PERIOD

Each passing year brings us more and more liberties PERIOD We can now belch out loud at parties and not be thought rude PERIOD We can show sexual situations on television without facing censorship PERIOD We journalists can now freely set words like damn and hell into print for all to see and enjoy as well PERIOD

Yes we have learned to accept each others bad habits PERIOD Weve said Hey its OK to pee on my lawn when youre drunk PERIOD As a matter of fact its kind of funny. we have taken offenses that were either morally or legally punishable in the past and turned them into a little slap on the wrist PERIOD After all accepting each others downfalls is what will bring the human race closer together right

Wrong PERIOD Nice try though PERIOD We seem to have accepted things that are within human control and begun punishing people for things that they have no say in PERIOD I recently watched the Rock Hudson Story on TV with some friends and could barely hear the show over the continuous stream of malicious comments against homosexuals PERIOD

When I told others of the incident I faced a second flow of slander PERIOD I am personally extremely content dating men and wouldnt change for the world but that doesnt give me the right to slander gay persons who dont agree with my preferences PERIOD

Lets try another example PERIOD Its a hometown favorite here at NIUpersons of different skin color PERIOD We seem to have a real problem accepting people who dont look like we do PERIOD Why is it so hard to understand that some things are beyond our control PERIOD Do you really think that people choose to be black or white or oriental or gay or whatever just to piss you off Some of you certainly act like it PERIOD

A colleague of mine said issues like these are social problems and social problems are seldom solved PERIOD Why is that Why cant we just accept people for what they are PERIOD In cases like these we certainly cant change them PERIOD This goes out to everyone PERIOD Contrary to popular belief the straight white population isnt the only group to blame PERIOD Everybody has had a hand in it although some like to continuously play the victim PERIOD If everyone wasnt involved the issues wouldnt be this large PERIOD

I know my little peace and brotherly love speech seems like a pipe dream to most of you but if we make a conscious effort who knows PERIOD Five years ago no one would have guessed the Germans would destroy the Berlin Wall and Communism would be in a state of despair PERIOD Think about it PERIOD
