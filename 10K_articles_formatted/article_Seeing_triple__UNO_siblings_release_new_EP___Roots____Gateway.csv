If you go to UNO you may have seen freshmen Sophie Simon and Cooper Clark around campus or even had a class with them PERIOD What you may not know upon first glance however is that these triplets make up a band called Clark  Company PERIOD

The band first started out as a hardrock cover band called Strange Antics PERIOD Sophie singer songwriter and pianist of the group said that it was a good experience and taught the siblings how to be a band but the rock genre definitely wasnt for them PERIOD

It wasnt really clicking for me and I felt like I wasnt writing in the style I wanted to write in she said PERIOD I started writing more acousticpiano music and then I asked my brothers what if we start a band with just piano bass and drums They said okay and thats how Clark  Co PERIOD got started PERIOD It was our sophomore year of high school. when asked if they found it hard to balance school with their music career the triplets said that they only practice about once a week so its not too bad PERIOD They played a lot of gigs this past summer but nowtry to balance it out with school by limiting it to two or three gigs per month PERIOD

Along with Simon on drums and Cooper on bass the band also features UNO freshman Cameron Thelander on tenor saxophone and sophomore Michael Palandri on alto saxophone PERIOD

Their first album Three of Swords was released in January  PERIOD Sophie described it as a singersongwriter soft sound PERIOD This sound contrasts quite a bit with their second album Larger World which was released in November  and has a more blues and jazz vibe PERIOD

They released their new EP Roots on Friday Nov PERIOD  at The Slowdown PERIOD The opening act Dr PERIOD Croon featured Devon Fulton Thelander and twothirds of the Clarks Cooper and Simon PERIOD Sophie said this EP is unique because it plays around with different styles of music PERIOD

I really liked the idea of studying different musical styles and then making them sound modern putting a Clark  Co PERIOD sound to them she said PERIOD

The band has recently been nominated for the  Omaha Entertainment  Arts Awards under the Best Blues category PERIOD

As far as where theyre going from here the siblings said that their sound will definitely be different on their next album PERIOD

For our next project rather than going to someone elses studio for our new album were going to slow it down a bit and record several songs in our own studio Simon said PERIOD We want it to have kind of an ambient sound more like raw recordings PERIOD We want to really be able to take our time with them. click here to hear a sample of their music PERIOD
