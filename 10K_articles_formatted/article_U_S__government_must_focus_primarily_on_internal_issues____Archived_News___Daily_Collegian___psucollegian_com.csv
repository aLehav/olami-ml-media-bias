The . magnitude earthquake that shook Haiti on Tuesday was one of the worst tragedies to ever hit the small country taking many innocent lives PERIOD As Americans we believe humanitarian crises abroad are important but perhaps we should first concern ourselves with the needs of our own suffering citizens PERIOD

The United States immediately pledged relief efforts to Haiti in the form of federal money and rescue workers PERIOD Thats right they are wasting the money we borrowed from foreign countries for things such as bank bailouts but end up spending it on foreign nations PERIOD So we borrowed trillions of dollars and then we turn around and spend it on Haiti which doesnt have any return on investment PERIOD We are in major debt with absolutely no end in sight and we start giving money to a foreign nation while there are U.S PERIOD citizens living in the streets and eating out of the trash PERIOD

Before we start helping out foreign nations and their citizens why dont we get things back in order in our own country PERIOD The U.S PERIOD government needs to start worrying about us instead of putting its nose in foreign affairs and trying to be the Mr PERIOD Nice Guy of the world PERIOD It is not our duty as a nation to help out any nation that asks for help when we cant even take care of ourselves PERIOD Just because we are the top country in the world does not mean we have to help any one out get caught up in foreign affairs or even try to tell foreign nations how to do things PERIOD
