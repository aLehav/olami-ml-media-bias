Dear Readers

My name is Emily Chertow PERIOD I am following my passion in journalism as I grow to be a sophomore at Penn State University PERIOD As I have a love for writing I also have a love for helping others and giving advice PERIOD Im fortunate to have the opportunity to combine these interests in a column for The Daily Collegian PERIOD

In my column I will give advice from my perspective as a young adult PERIOD I am by no means an expert or psychologist but I welcome questions from anyone  students parents teens adults professors siblings etc PERIOD  who are interested in what advice I can offer PERIOD I hope from reading this column that you will learn some things here and there that you can bring into your daily life PERIOD

All the questions that I answer are and will be questions that I have received from others by snail mail or email all being reallife situations PERIOD Do not hesitate to send me questions information on who is asking the questions will be kept confidential PERIOD You can send your questions to me at DearEmilyTDCgmail.com PERIOD

I look forward to hearing from you PERIOD

Dear Emily

What do I do when I just know the relationship is at an end but I feel bad for breaking it off I tried asking her to take a break but she just starts bawling her eyes out and says I cant do that PERIOD

Dear Heartbreaker

As much as it may hurt the both of you to break it off you are only going to hurt her more by not giving the relationship  percent of your full attention PERIOD

If you feel bad then you should be able to realize that you are wasting her valuable time PERIOD While she seems to be obviously still attached and into you it is only right to end it so that she can find the time to move on and potentially find someone else that will make her happy PERIOD The longer you drag it out the more it will hurt her and the more unfair it is to her PERIOD

I hope that you find a way to break up with her respectfully and end things on good terms PERIOD I recommend sitting down with her in person and discussing things and getting both of your feelings out  but before you do this you need to collect your thoughts PERIOD Think about what you are going to share with her and how you want the outcome to be PERIOD If you are going to break up with her then do it in the most chivalrous way because that is the least that she deserves PERIOD

Dear Emily

I am a freshman and I am involved in sorority recruitment PERIOD The process is stressing me out and I am now doubting what I should do PERIOD Do you have any suggestions

Dear freshman

I suggest going through with the recruitment process and see where you end up PERIOD If you have an unsure feeling about it then consider dropping and finding other ways to get involved with a good group of people that share similar interests as you PERIOD Greek life is not for everyone and honestly there is a huge stigma that comes along with it very often PERIOD

Yet the incredible thing with Penn State is that there is something for everyone PERIOD I promise that you will find your niche but it may just take some time and there is nothing wrong with that PERIOD

Freshman year is the time to find and define yourself so let it happen PERIOD Surround yourself with people that lift you up and make you feel happy PERIOD If you arent feeling good about something then take that as a sign that it may not be for you PERIOD You can talk to your friends about what they are getting involved in your RA in what they suggest you getting involved in and even your adviser in what they have to offer that could be related to your major PERIOD

THON is a huge factor at Penn State and regardless of what you get your hands into I highly suggest joining a THON org or THON committee PERIOD Joining one of these you will meet some incredible people that you will make great memories with and it will allow you to build some long lasting relationships with many PERIOD Dont let recruitment stress you out PERIOD Take each day and each visit at the sorority step by step and you will find your way PERIOD

Dear Emily

My husband and I come from China we arrived at PSU just a week ago PERIOD My husband wants to get his PhD degree here PERIOD Could you please introduce me some communities clubs or NGOs that I can participate in as F2 visa Also my English is not good is there some places like study groups that I can prove my English

Dear Eager to Learn

I can only imagine how overwhelming and exciting it is to come to America and especially be in Happy Valley PERIOD While your husband is busy getting his PhD from the best university it gives you the perfect opportunity to broaden your horizons and reach out to different people and organizations within the community PERIOD

Offcampus I would start by joining the local YMCA or a fitness club PERIOD This will allow you to meet men and women your age while also continuing to be healthy PERIOD Often health clubs offer social events for you to meet people in your area and that is how you will build relationships PERIOD

There is also the Chinese Alliance Church that is local and very close to downtown and campus PERIOD That is a great resource to look into because they will give you many options of meeting people and will guide you in expanding your English knowledge PERIOD I also recommend searching the web for more options for adult learning and education PERIOD

Also get involved in hobbies that you are interested in whether it be a running group or reading books in the library youll find people that share similar interests as you and can help you along the way PERIOD
