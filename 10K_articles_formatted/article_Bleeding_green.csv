Ihad a student in my learning community ask me if Ohio Universitys Homecoming was worth staying in Athens for. immediately I answered Yes As a seasoned sophomore I thought How is that even a question

I think Homecoming Weekend at OU is one of the best weekends of the semester and everyone should push themselves to attend at least one of the weekends festivities PERIOD Whether it is the pep rally the parade the football game or the infamous gettogethers beforehand Homecoming is worth staying in Athens for PERIOD

As I was reflecting on my last Homecoming experience I realized that everything seemed to fall into place for me that weekend PERIOD It was the first time I branched out from my high school friends and paved the way for deeper connections and it was also the first time I felt genuinely proud to attend OU PERIOD

For all new students freshmen and transfers alike Homecoming is the first weekend you will see just how thick Bobcat blood is PERIOD I remember sitting in my firstyear seminars listening to my professors preach about alum networks and reiterating Bobcats help Bobcats over and over again for me all were empty promises until Homecoming Weekend PERIOD

Homecoming Weekend attracts hundreds of alums all of whom have the ability to connect you in some way to where you want to go PERIOD Alums will visit past clubs they were in their old sports teams and most definitely be at the Homecoming parade to see the Marching  Alumni Bands performance PERIOD

As cheesy as it may sound Bobcat blood does run thicker PERIOD Bobcats do care for Bobcats PERIOD

In all of my runins with OU alums they were willing to speak with me regarding my future and wanted to help me get there PERIOD During my internship I worked for a large insurance company in Cincinnati PERIOD I knew there wouldnt be a lot of OU alums but there were bound to be some PERIOD Almost all of the Bobcats sought me out to say hello within my first week and I recently had the opportunity to reconnect with some at a career fair last week PERIOD Not all universities are like that PERIOD

I urge everyone to take advantage of the opportunities that Homecoming brings and actually talk to people PERIOD Alums want to talk to you they want to hear about your accomplishments and failures and they want to help you PERIOD

Business aside Homecoming is supposed to be fun PERIOD Have fun this weekend and do something you have never done before PERIOD Attend the parade yell like hell at the pep rally and go to the football game but do not leave Athens during Homecoming Weekend PERIOD

I am proud to call OU my home and I cant wait to welcome home the Bobcats that came before us this weekend PERIOD
