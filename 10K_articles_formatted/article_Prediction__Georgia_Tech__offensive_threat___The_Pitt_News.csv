The last time the Pitt Panthers and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets squared off it took two exemplary scoring plays by Pitt  with less than five minutes of play remaining  to seal a victory PERIOD

Quarterback Nathan Peterman connected with tight end Scott Orndoff who bolted down the field for a 74yard passing touchdown to tie the game at  points PERIOD

Minutes later kicker Chris Blewitt sent a kick ricocheting off the right side of the post and through the uprights just in time for the Panthers  victory PERIOD

This matchup could go a similar way especially considering the Panthers enter Saturdays game against the Yellow Jackets the same way they entered last year  coming off a loss to the Oklahoma State Cowboys PERIOD

This seasons loss to the Cowboys marked Pitts second loss in a row PERIOD Despite dropping those games head coach Pat Narduzzi seems largely unfazed PERIOD

Id like to be here under different circumstances but another tough one as we talked Saturday Narduzzi said in his weekly press conference PERIOD Obviously still disappointed in really how it came out but actually when you watch the tape you dont feel as bad as you did Saturday. regardless of the teams feelings about the previous game the Panthers approach to another electric offensive onslaught is important to the upcoming game PERIOD Georgia Tech quarterback TaQuon Marshall and running back KirVonte Benson will be major playmaking threats PERIOD

Marshall and Benson pose a precarious challenge to the Panthers because of their durability PERIOD Both of the Georgia Tech rushers who have amassed doubledigit carries in each of the Yellow Jackets last two games PERIOD

Pitt has surrendered  yards on the ground in three games this season  a . yards per game average  which isnt bad PERIOD But if the Panthers are going to find success in week their front seven will need to be prepared and committed to stopping Georgia Techs versatile running game PERIOD

The Yellow Jackets specialize in what is known as the spread option or triple option PERIOD After snapping the ball the quarterback will either roll to his left or right and run  if he sees an opening  rather than drop back to pass PERIOD He can also pitch the ball to a running back or wide receiver in motion PERIOD This type of offense leads to astounding rushing states and high scoring games PERIOD

In Georgia Techs two games this season  with their game last week against the University of Central Florida was canceled due to Hurricane Irma  the Yellow Jackets ran the ball  times PERIOD In the process they picked up  yards and eight touchdowns PERIOD Marshall and Benson made up almost  percent of the  carries PERIOD

Georgia Techs ability to run the ball has developed the teams passing attack into an anomaly PERIOD However when Marshall opts to throw the ball the results can be lethal PERIOD

Marshall has only thrown the ball  times over the course of the season PERIOD Of those  attempts  were completed  with three resulting in touchdowns in the teams game against Jacksonville State PERIOD

With these threats in mind Pitt should be cementing its plays and keying in on the optimal players for a win PERIOD

But Narduzzi is still keeping the decision of starting quarterback to himself PERIOD In the Panthers last two games both redshirt sophomore Ben DiNucci and redshirt senior Max Browne have filled the role of quarterback PERIOD

Were going to continue to evaluate the quarterback situation Narduzzi said PERIOD They both do some really good things on tape. while leaving that slot open if junior wide receiver Quadree Henderson and redshirt junior running back Qadree Ollison step up Saturday Pitts offence can still be successful PERIOD

These two have been staples of Pitts offense for the last two seasons PERIOD Look for each of them to remind the FBS that they belong among the best players in the country PERIOD

PREDICTION

If DiNucci does receive his first start at quarterback it will give the Panthers their best opportunity to keep up with the Yellow Jackets offense PERIOD

However the game will ultimately come down to whether or not Pitts defense can force turnovers and hold the Yellow Jackets to field goals in vital situations PERIOD
