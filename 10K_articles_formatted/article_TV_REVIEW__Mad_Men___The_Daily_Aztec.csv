Summer  has finally delivered a new television show worth watching the gripping new series Mad Men. in its firstever scripted television show the channel AMC brings millions of basiccable subscribers this new drama from the writer and producer of The Sopranos that you simply shouldnt miss PERIOD

Mad Men is a stinging drama about Madison Avenue advertisers at the dawn of the 60s a time when bigotry sexism and antiSemitism were all part of a normal day at the office PERIOD The show is tremendously smart sexy and downright addictive PERIOD You can even turn the sound off and just watch the amazing suits unbelievable set design and the topnotch cinematography and youll still become addicted PERIOD

The shows leading adman is Don Draper Jon Hamm the lead creative director at a top advertising company PERIOD Hamm portrays the calm professional Draper in an intensely complex yet subtle way and his performance is easily the shows best PERIOD Another excellent performance comes from Elisabeth Moss who plays Peggy a new secretary in the office PERIOD

While the shows main focus is on the dashing admen the show also sheds light on the struggle women of the time faced working in a place where sexism and sexual harassment were as commonplace as staplers and typewriters PERIOD Moss plays Peggy wonderfully emphasizing her inner strength and character that lies just beneath the polite shy surface PERIOD

The man behind the show is Matthew Weiner who wrote Mad Men seven years ago as a sample for HBO and it got him his job on The Sopranos. weiners excellent writing skills come through in the shows amazing dialogue one of the other great strengths PERIOD

Thanks to shows such as The Sopranos and now Mad Men television is beginning to feel more like movies PERIOD Mad Men has all the complexity production value and technical beauty of a feature film and by the end of the shows hourlong running time you cant wait for next weeks episode PERIOD",TV REVIEW: Mad Men â€“ The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
