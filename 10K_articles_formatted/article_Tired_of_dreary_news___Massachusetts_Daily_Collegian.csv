I have heard college described as a fouryear hiatus from the real world. it has been compared to a blissful bubble of naivety  a safe haven from the troubles outside the microcosmic world on campus PERIOD

With college comes the luxury of being on the outside and looking in  your greatest concern is what to wear to Saturday nights frat party or how many pints of ice cream to buy for allnighters during finals week PERIOD Make the most of these years PERIOD Ive heard it said because youll never get to experience anything quite like them again PERIOD

Now that Im in college I cannot possibly fathom who thought up all that blissful bubble propaganda PERIOD Only a particular kind of student can enjoy such an utterly happy golucky existence PERIOD

In my opinion its the people who party nonstop occasionally mixing in a study session PERIOD Or its the students who during breakfast stare at their omelets instead of the newspaper headlines PERIOD

It is the students who temporarily lose their peripheral vision in the campus center and are blind to the rows of tables protesting the Iraq War or saving Darfur not to mention the MassPIRG volunteers waiting to pounce with some petition to help stop global warming  and I admit it I was one of them last week PERIOD

So I succumbed to the realization that I am disillusioned PERIOD Its impossible to escape the worlds hardships even on a college campus of clich
