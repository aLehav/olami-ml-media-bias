2213,2022-03-16,"i recently found out that the Kyle LeeRyan Kaminski College Council CC incident is still a prominent issue on campus at the U of C PERIOD For those who dont remember the event that sparked the whole scandal was when Kaminski accused Lee of among other things organizing a blood drive that had restrictions on donors constituting inherent structural racism and heterosexism. i wish to add some objective information to that discussion and comment as an outside observer PERIOD First let me comment that I have been a physician since  PERIOD In the past  years I have ordered several thousand blood transfusions for my patients PERIOD I am therefore familiar with the process for obtaining and administering donated blood and blood products PERIOD

I have also performed volunteer surgical work in African nations PERIOD Thus I am familiar with the high incidence of HIV transmission in those countries PERIOD

Thirdly I have cared for many HIVinfected patients here in Chicago and thus I am familiar with the devastation individuals and families face PERIOD It is with these experiences and qualifications that I wish to comment upon the situation of Lee PERIOD

Kaminski suggested in his assault upon the well intentioned blood drive that the prevention of donations of blood from persons who have visited certain African nations constitutes inherent structural racism against those persons PERIOD That contention is ridiculous PERIOD

The American Red Cross ARC guidelines are based on statistical fact PERIOD Among those facts is the clear data that the rate of latent or hidden HIV infection is higher in persons who have recently visited certain African nations PERIOD

Likewise Kaminski attacked Lees planned blood drive with its restrictions upon persons who have engaged in homosexual behavior as heterosexist. this is another absurd attack by Kaminski PERIOD To this date the rate of hidden infection by HIV is higher in persons with a history of homosexual activity PERIOD That very sentence might again make Mr PERIOD Kaminski queasy but it needs to be stated PERIOD

When trying to protect the health of blood product recipients we do not unnecessarily risk lives so that we can save Kaminski from his queasiness PERIOD We dont throw away life just so we can be politically correct PERIOD That is the thing about science and public health policy PERIOD One looks at the facts PERIOD One then acts in the way that keeps people safe period PERIOD

I wholeheartedly believe that there is indeed much work to be done for gay rights in our society PERIOD In fact I would stand shoulder to shoulder with Kaminski to work against for example the militarys Dont Ask Dont Tell policy or against a constitutional ban on gay marriage PERIOD However in the case of Lee Kaminski has it all wrong PERIOD Furthermore the Universitys LGBT community or at least some of its members is shooting at the wrong target PERIOD These misguided activists are demonstrating ignorance about blood donations PERIOD

Homophobia and discrimination certainly are still commonly encountered and it is for that reason that making false charges must be avoided PERIOD Making false charges such as those made against Lee will only weaken efforts against true homophobia and true discrimination PERIOD

Rather than censuring Lee who has apologized for his insensitive email the CC should have considered censuring Kaminski for his outrageous allegations PERIOD He has been wrong from the start and the fact that eight College Council members voted for Lees impeachment makes me wonder if these members are able to think beyond political correctness PERIOD

Perhaps whats best now is for the parties involved to move forward in a manner that does not disrupt the function of the CC PERIOD Also members of your student body should focus on medical facts not emotion when judging public health controversies PERIOD This will be especially necessary when after graduation they encounter health policies that might appear at first glance to be discriminatory PERIOD
