5981,2023-07-11,"when creating glass pipes and other smoking devices GRAV Labs usually aims for practicality PERIOD But they took the plunge to step out of their comfort zone when they forged Goliath the worlds largest water pipe PERIOD

GRAV a company founded in  by David Daily is an Austinbased facility that manufactures smoking appliances out of Pyrex glass PERIOD The companys name is derived from its popular namesake product the Gravitron an allglass gravity smoking device PERIOD

In  GRAV was approached by the TV show Shipping Wars to make the worlds largest water pipe a reality and deliver it from Austin to Denver PERIOD Glassblowers like Stephan Peirce worked on the project at GRAV taking dynamics like centrifugal forges into account PERIOD

Kate Csillagi Chief of Sales at GRAV is a former glassblower and said she respects Peirces ingenuity especially since he took on such a large challenge PERIOD

Stephan Peirce is a mad scientist and a glass genius Csillagi said PERIOD He has broken a lot of unspoken records around glass so he thought about doing the biggest water pipe for a long time. as a result of her own experience Csillagi said she knew the complications that this project involved like annealing the complex process of heating glass PERIOD

To stabilize the glass you have to raise it to a certain temperature and then bring it back down so that the actual molecular structure of the glass is stable and wont just crack on you Csillagi said PERIOD

Originally three giant pipes were made but only one survived the annealing at  feet tall PERIOD Maria Hansen creative director at GRAV said she named the giant water pipe Goliath and saw for herself that it wasnt just meant for display PERIOD

We would go up to the first story roof and then people would try and hit it from there and some were successful  it actually did work Hansen said PERIOD I thought it needed a vacuum to get the smoke up but it turns out you just need strong lungs. originally destined for Denver Colorado the facility where it was going to be held had a 9foot ceiling two feet too short for Goliath PERIOD So the pipe was then sold off to a client in New Orleans for  PERIOD

GRAV once collaborated with a shop in Austin called 420Science on building the tallest STAX pipe a water pipe that stood at  feet tall PERIOD However Csillagi said it doesnt compare to making a solid glass piece that stands on its own like the Goliath PERIOD

In thirteen years GRAV has innovated with products like the STAX pipe which allows clients to mix and match components and customize their pipe to fit their needs PERIOD As an ancillary business brand director Tanya Rosenzweig said GRAV doesnt like to be exclusively associated with the marijuana industry as glass pipes serve various purposes PERIOD Rosenwzweig said GRAV aims to expand as a household brand and educate customers that recreational smoking is a normal thing PERIOD

A lot of people when I tell them what I do they always have this chuckle Rosenzweig said PERIOD Were all adults and there are a lot of people out there that are users so we wanna help shed away some of those stigmas. though events like  draw a lot of attention Hansen said she loves the niche clientele GRAV has attained because the product sells itself PERIOD

I dont have to push anything on anybody  Hansen said PERIOD At the end of the day what were trying to do is supply people with an experience whether its to have fun with friends or for comfort reasons. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",Austin glass blowers go full blown with largest water pipe â€“ The Daily Texan,University of Texas Austin
