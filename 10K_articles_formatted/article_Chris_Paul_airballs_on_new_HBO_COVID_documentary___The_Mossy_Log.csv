Point guard for the Phoenix Suns and eleventime NBA AllStar Chris Paul did not see the pandemic coming PERIOD

The first time I remember hearing the word COVID I was playing in New Orleans Paul said.I remember the shoes I wore that game PERIOD On the outside I wrote pray for Wuhan. just two months later Paul and his thenteammates on the Oklahoma City Thunder were stuck in their locker room PERIOD Their anticipated match against the Utah Jazz had been postponed PERIOD Jazz center Rudy Gobert had tested positive for the coronavirus PERIOD By the end of the night the NBA would suspend the rest of its season PERIOD The NHL MLB MLS and Summer Olympics swiftly followed suit PERIOD

HBO Sports new documentary The Day Sports Stood Still aims to capture the coronavirus sweeping impact on professional sports PERIOD With Paul joining as executive producer the film features interviews with Washington Mystics guard Natasha Cloud LA Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts and countless professional athletes around the world PERIOD

The Day Sports Stood Still is a jampacked  minutes that cannot decide which story it wants to tell about  PERIOD It oscillates between the crushing despair of the pandemic and clever jokes about the NBA bubble PERIOD

The first half unfolds with alarmist graphics a steadily climbing coronavirus death toll and a greyscale map bleeding red out of China PERIOD A few years from now such harrowing depictions might be a sobering history lesson right now they rub salt in the wound PERIOD

Marten de Roon midfielder for the Italian club Atalanta recalls how the pandemic tore through Bergamo a city in Northern Italy PERIOD

The normal thing in Bergamo is the church bells ringing when somebody dies de Roon said PERIOD Because there were so many people dying the church bells were ringing like every half an hour. minnesota Timberwolves center KarlAnthony Towns gives a vulnerable interview about his mother Jacqueline Cruz who passed away from the virus PERIOD In a video originally shared on YouTube he recalls how Cruz went sideways in excruciating detail the 103degree Fahrenheit fever the ventilator and the phone call notifying Towns that his mother did not make it PERIOD

I just wanted to use my story and the things I was going through to make other people understand how serious it is maybe save their family save themselves Towns said PERIOD If I saved one life thats all I ever wanted to do in that video. towns candor about this traumatic life event merits enormous respect especially given that AfroLatino men are so rarely given platforms to express their grief PERIOD Yet when hundreds of Americans continue to succumb to coronavirus every day releasing a film with such graphic depictions of death constitutes poor judgment on HBO Sports part PERIOD

The documentarys second half switches gears addressing the Black Lives Matter movement and the nowiconic boycott in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha Wisconsin PERIOD

Paul who is president of the National Basketball Players Association NBPVA refuses to sit on the sideline PERIOD

We NBA players want to see Blackowned businesses be championed Paul said PERIOD Police reform education historically Black colleges and universities right Start talking about food deserts. the Day Sports Stood Still is arguably at its best when Paul tries to navigate the NBAs bureaucracy deciding alongside fellow players how to use their leverage as a majorityBlack league PERIOD

Sports has changed forever Paul said PERIOD Theres no question about it because the athlete whoever it may be they understand their power. unfortunately the incredible work that Paul and other NBA or WNBA players are doing is diminished alongside possibly performative shots of Black Lives Matter floor paint courtside PERIOD

Somewhere on the cutting room floor of this clumsy documentary there is a provocative movie about Black players white team owners and Pauls efforts to use basketball to protect his children from police brutality PERIOD But The Day Sports Stood Still is not that documentary PERIOD
