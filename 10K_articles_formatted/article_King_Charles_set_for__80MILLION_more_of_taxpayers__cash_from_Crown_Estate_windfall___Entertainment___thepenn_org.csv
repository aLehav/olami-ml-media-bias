Considerable cloudiness PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



King Charles is in line to get  million more of British taxpayers money PERIOD

The monarch  crowned in May alongside his wife Queen Camilla  will receive the cash over two years through a Crown Estate windfall  despite the UK governments plans to slash estate profits given to the royals from  per cent to  per cent PERIOD

Charles . million annual funding from the government will remain flat for a fourth consecutive year next year but is forecast to be boosted by just under  million in both  and  PERIOD

He is going to benefit from a boom in offshore wind farms under a funding formula that pegs the Sovereign Grant to the equivalent of a percentage of the Crown Estate property empires profits PERIOD

The Estate which owns rights to swathes of seabed is expected to see its annual profits in England Wales and Northern Ireland soar from . million in  to  to more than  billion in  to  and  to  thanks to fees paid by offshore wind farm companies PERIOD

So even under changes to the way the taxpayerfunded Sovereign Grant is calculated the king is still set to get almost 40m extra a year in  and  PERIOD

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said The new Sovereign Grant rate reflects the unexpected significant increase in the Crown Estates net profits from offshore wind developments while providing enough funding for official business. the king asked in January for wind farm profits to go to the public good PERIOD

As the reigning monarch he nominally owns the Crown Estate whose assets include Regent Street and other parts of Londons West End PERIOD

In practice it is an independent property company created to make money for the government PERIOD
