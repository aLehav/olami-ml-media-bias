The Tennessee baseball team during game againstMTSUon Feb PERIOD   at Lindsey Nelson Stadium PERIOD

The Tennessee baseball team could not have asked for a better start to the  season posting a  record so far this season PERIOD

While the Vols have been able to put enough runs on the board to win games there is no doubt that they have been led by their pitching staff PERIOD

No matter who is on the mound there is always a good vibe Tennessee pitcher Will Neely said PERIOD We all have faith in each other that each guy is going to go out and get the job done. through the first nine games Tennessee pitchers have combined to put up an . eRA which leads the nation PERIOD The Vols are hoping they can carry that success to their first road trip of the season beginning with the Cox Diamond Invitational in Pensacola Florida this weekend PERIOD

Not only will this be the first time Tennessee will have to play outside of Lindsey Nelson Stadium but it also offers a unique challenge for the Vols that they have not seen yet this season PERIOD Tennessee will play a different opponent each day of the weekend PERIOD

It kind of adds a different flavor to the whole weekend Tennessee coach Tony Vitello said PERIOD You get a new challenge every day and you get a chance to see different faces. not only will Tennessee experience their first road trip of the season but they will also face a couple of teams who are off to pretty good starts themselves PERIOD

We really did not know what the tournament would bring because the field was not filled when we signed up for it Vitello said PERIOD Now you look at three teams who have some success. louisiana Monroe

Tennessee will get the weekend started Friday afternoon when they face Louisiana Monroe at  p.m PERIOD

The Warhawks will head into the weekend with a record of  but they have already had the experience of playing an SEC school when they opened the season against LSU PERIOD Not only does ULM have the experience of playing an SEC school they were able to put up a good fight against the Tigers who are ranked No PERIOD  or No PERIOD  in most of the college baseball polls PERIOD

Against LSU Louisiana Monroe led the game for most of the game early and would not trail until the seventh inning PERIOD

Louisiana Monroe has given LSU a run for their money Vitello said PERIOD They really had the game in the bag but they were just not able to finish the game off. offensively the Warhawks are led by junior firstbaseman Cameron Horton who has a . batting average and is tied for the team lead in doubles PERIOD

North Florida

Tennessee will have a real test when they take on the North Florida Ospreys on Saturday afternoon in its second game of the weekend PERIOD

North Florida will come into the weekend with a record of  while being able to pick up some signature wins along the way PERIOD

Like Louisiana Monroe the Ospreys have already had experience this season playing against the SEC PERIOD However North Florida will head into the weekend with a  record against the SEC to start the year which is undeniably impressive PERIOD

To open the season the Ospreys hosted the Missouri Tigers opening weekend PERIOD By the end of the weekend North Florida was able to pick up two victories in the three game series PERIOD

Just three days after an emotional series win the Ospreys were tasked with taking on the third ranked team in the nation the Florida Gators PERIOD However North Florida again would prove they were not intimidated by taking on a big name SEC opponent PERIOD

In that game North Florida was able to hammer the ball all across the ballpark on its way to hitting three home runs and defeating the Gators  PERIOD The matchup between a Tennessee pitching staff who has been unstoppable versus an Osprey offense who has been able to score some runs will be the matchup to watch Saturday afternoon PERIOD

Western Kentucky

Tennessee will finish the weekend off in Pensacola when they face the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers on Sunday afternoon at  p.m PERIOD

Western Kentucky will come into the weekend with a record of  which includes a sweep of a team that Tennessee has already played this season Northern Kentucky PERIOD

On the offensive side of the ball Western Kentucky is led by freshman Jackson Swiney PERIOD Through his first eight games Swiney has posted a batting average of . which includes three doubles and four RBIs PERIOD

The biggest thing with the matchup with Western Kentucky will be familiarity PERIOD

Western Kentucky is right above us they probably know a lot of the guys on our roster and vice versa Vitello said PERIOD They are going to want to kick our teeth in. log In
