Our first question will be about the presidents position on the Martha Palmer issue Owens said PERIOD The commission is interested in LaTourettes opinion of the firing of Palmer a CHANCE counselor and the several protests which have arisen from the issue PERIOD

Owens said the commission has not addressed the Palmer issue and does not have an opinion about it PERIOD He said the commission members have been asked to formulate their own opinions about the issue PERIOD

The commission also will ask LaTourette what the mission is of NIUs department of Affirmative Action because commission members do not believe the department reacted promptly when Palmer contacted them after she learned of her firing Owens said PERIOD

Palmer who is chairman of the commissions program committee said she has not had time to look over the agenda of todays meeting or to think of any specific questions for LaTourette PERIOD However she said I do have some major concerns that pertain to Mr PERIOD LaTourette. owens said the entire meeting will be devoted to LaTourettes goal outline and questions directed to him PERIOD He said the commission has about  specific questions to ask but additional questions will be accepted from the floor PERIOD
