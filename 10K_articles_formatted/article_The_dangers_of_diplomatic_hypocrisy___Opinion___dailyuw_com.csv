The United States needs to learn a lesson Hypocrisy bites you in the ass PERIOD

Throughout American history many ideals  such as democracy and freedom  have been upheld in the name of the  But these ideals have been contradicted time and again by government actions PERIOD

Take U.S PERIOD policy in Iran PERIOD Or Argentina PERIOD Or Chile Guatemala Iraq Afghanistan and Nicaragua PERIOD This isnt anything to be surprised about unless you only watch mainstream media and dont pay attention in history classes PERIOD

The United States reiterated its support for nuclear nonproliferation read ending nuclear weapons research at the G8 Summit last week PERIOD

But if the United States supports Indias nuclear facilities while condemning Irans and North Koreas programs it could threaten the  its constantly fighting for PERIOD

Nuclear war is something we should be very scared of PERIOD Despite what our parents were taught you cant just hide under your desk when a nuclear bomb is dropped PERIOD These weapons have the potential to create permanent damage for many generations and our government may be helping India do just that PERIOD

In  almost a decade after the Cold War ended India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons for the first time PERIOD The years that followed brought the world closer to nuclear war than it had been since the Cold War was at its hottest PERIOD

Last month the U.S PERIOD House of Representatives created a bill that would exempt India from certain parts of the U.S PERIOD Atomic Energy Act of   in essence supporting Indias nuclear energy facilities an agreement worked out between President Bush and Indias Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in March PERIOD

India has not signed the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty NPT a document that seeks to stop the advancement of nuclear weapons by holding those who sign it to use nuclear technology solely for energy purposes PERIOD The NPT also makes weapons inspections mandatory at the request of the International Atomic Energy Agency or UN Security Council PERIOD

There is little doubt that India will use U.S PERIOD support to continue its nuclear weapons technology PERIOD India is not bound to the standards of the NPT nor is it required to submit to weapons inspectors PERIOD

All this while the United States is subtly threatening military action with Iran over its nuclear facilities and battling North Koreas nuclear advances PERIOD

Hypocrisy Nah PERIOD Stupidity is more like it PERIOD

Unlike Iran and North Korea India is not a threat to the United States or its closest allies but its government is unstable and rampant with corruption PERIOD Transparency International ranks India  of  on the Global Corruption Index one being the least corrupt PERIOD

Money  anyones money  has unlimited power in corrupt nations PERIOD A few years down the road the governments hypocrisy could end up hurting its own citizens PERIOD

What did the United States learn by supporting Osama bin Laden during the Afghan war Apparently not much PERIOD
