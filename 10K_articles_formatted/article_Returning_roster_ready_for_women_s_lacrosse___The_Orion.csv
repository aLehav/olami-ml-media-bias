The  season looks like a bright one for the Chico State womens lacrosse team PERIOD

Many starters will return to show new members how its done as they take on the other teams competing in the Western Womens Lacrosse League PERIOD

They finished last year with an  league record but fell one game short of reaching the championships PERIOD Although plenty of firstyear students have joined the team for the upcoming season the Wildcats will rely on the veterans and continue with what they know best PERIOD

This is our third year in a row we have had our core starting roster playing together said Geneva Desin a junior and attacker for the team PERIOD Three girls on the team made the top  in scores and assists for us and our goalie was ranked high in the WWLL last season. this will allow the team to be more comfortable in their ability to play to their full potential PERIOD

The team will take on schools outside of the California Collegiate Athletic Association conference because lacrosse is a club sport at Chico State PERIOD Instead they will be competing in the WWLL against schools like Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and University of Nevada Las Vegas PERIOD

Rachael Crosby a senior and defender for the Wildcats expressed her hankering to get a crack at UC Berkeley PERIOD

We lost to Cal in our last game last season and that caused us to miss the championships Crosby said PERIOD Definitely looking forward to seeing them again. the Wildcats boast a strong offensive unit and the defense is a force to be reckoned with PERIOD The team will be returning with seasoned players and could become one of the best teams in the WWLL PERIOD

We definitely need to get stronger in that area Desin said PERIOD If were able to keep up with other teams then we will be able to compete at a higher level this season. head coach Niki Collins will lead the Wildcats as she tries to get the team into the championship tournament it missed last season PERIOD However this might be a stranger year than the past in terms of rules and how the game is played PERIOD

They changed the rules for us and we are changing the way we start games Crosby said PERIOD There will be a different amount of people the referees allow in the draw. the Wildcats despite rule changes and rookie additions will have the upper hand on the competition in the WWLL thanks to the continuity of the roster PERIOD The team will get on the road Feb PERIOD  to take on University of Southern California PERIOD
