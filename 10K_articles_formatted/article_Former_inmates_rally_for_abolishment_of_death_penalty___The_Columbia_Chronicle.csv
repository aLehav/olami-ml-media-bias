The death penalty does nothing to deter crime said Marlene Martin board member of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty PERIOD It is a barbaric practice carried out in the secrecy of night pumping poison into people who are too poor to afford their

own lawyers. the Illinois Senate joined the House of Representatives on Jan PERIOD  in a  vote to repeal the states death penalty PERIOD Quinn will make the final decision to abolish capital punishment in Illinois though he has yet to confirm his support for the bill PERIOD Passing the bill would make Illinois the sixteenth state without the death penalty PERIOD Quinn could not be reached to comment PERIOD

According to Fields he and the other exonerated men would like to speak with Quinn before he finalizes a decision PERIOD

We were the victims and we think its only fair the governor hear from us firsthand so he can know what we went through Fields said PERIOD

The Campaign to End the Death Penalty is asking Quinn to release the  prisoners currently on death row PERIOD There has not been an execution in Illinois since  according to the Death Penalty Information Center PERIOD The campaign would like the number to stay at zero PERIOD

Marvin Reeves a Burge torture victim spent  years on death row and said he wants the current prisoners up for capital punishment to be granted a new hearing PERIOD

If the death penalty is to be repealed then no one should have that sentence Martin said PERIOD So we are also asking the governor to commute all of the sentences. at the rally other exonerated men told similar stories of decades spent in prison for crimes they were innocent of PERIOD

Darby Tillis one of Illinois first exonerated death row prisoners said although he was released more than  years ago he is not free of the systems effects PERIOD

I spent nine years one month and  days on death row waiting to die for a crime I did not commit Tillis said PERIOD

Illinois has the second highest number of exonerated individuals in the U.S. according to the Death Penalty Information Center PERIOD

Since  the state acquitted  prisoners from death row which to Fields means there have been  near fatal statesanctioned mistakes in the criminal

justice system PERIOD

The wrongfully accused Gary Gaugers time on death row for the murder of his parents in  was shorter then most of the other exonerees PERIOD

However he emphasized the suffering he endured is irreversible PERIOD

We want him to know the scars that have been left on us Fields said PERIOD

According to Gauger most of the other exonerated men suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder PERIOD During his nine months on death row he said there were four prisoners killed by other prisoners and five executions PERIOD

I would like to see a general restructuring of the prison system to emphasize rehabilitation Gauger said PERIOD

The Campaign to End the Death Penalty stressed the effects the system has on family members as well PERIOD

Fields said he wants Quinn to know and understand the pain and suffering families go through PERIOD

I watched my daughter grow up from death row Fields said PERIOD I never had the chance to carry her on my back or hold her in my arms as a newborn child. he hopes Quinn will hear these stories and it will encourage him to repeal the bill PERIOD

We as Americans believe in justice so now is the time for us to step up Reeves said PERIOD
