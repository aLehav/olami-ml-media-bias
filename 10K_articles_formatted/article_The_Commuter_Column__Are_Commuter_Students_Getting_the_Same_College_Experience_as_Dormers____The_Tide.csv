We all remember our senior year of high school and when we had to make the decision of what college we would attend. all of my friends except for me went away to school but ironically half of them ended up coming back to Long Island for school PERIOD For undisclosed reasons I stayed home although I would have given my soul to go away to school just for the sole reason of being on my own and meeting different people PERIOD Then again I could do it at a school on the Island PERIOD But for you commuter students what do you think Do you feel you made the right decision by staying home or do you feel you should have gone away

I met up with a couple of commuters and was surprised by the results PERIOD Junior broadcasting major Nicholas Vento said I guess I dont spend much time on campus but I dont mind commuting PERIOD I didnt want to go away PERIOD If I really want that dorming experience Ill go visit my friends who go away to school. sophomore broadcasting major Alyssa Clarkin said I do spend a lot of time on campus because Im on the dance team PERIOD I feel like if you know your major when you go to class you see the same people every day and can connect with them since youre all going to school for the same thing. freshman undeclared Alex Dimiris disagreed saying I would definitely rather dorm at a school PERIOD You dont need to wake up early and drive PERIOD Its nice to have a roommate and make new friends PERIOD I know if I stay around Post for next year Im going to dorm just for the college experience. while I can agree with these students one of the main reasons I stayed home was to work and to be near my family PERIOD My little sister was going through high school and I couldnt abandon her during the four worst years of her life PERIOD I also got to work to help my parents pay for my tuition at school since they are already paying for another college tuition PERIOD Whatever your decision of commuting or dorming was it is possible to get the college experience you desire its what you make of it so make new friends and go out to local bars PERIOD Sometimes its nice to show the dormers the way around the Island PERIOD
