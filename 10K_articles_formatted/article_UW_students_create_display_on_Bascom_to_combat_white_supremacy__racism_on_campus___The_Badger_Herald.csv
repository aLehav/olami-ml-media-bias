University of Wisconsin student Caitlin Attaway the main organizer of the display said Bascom Hill was the perfect spot for the display because its location is central to campus and allows for a significant amount of people to view the display PERIOD The other group members included Falicia Elenberg Erika Hartzheim Karen Wong and Charlotte London PERIOD

Myself and the other members of my group  we feel like this is a prevalent issue and we need to combat this norm Attaway said PERIOD We were assigned to go out and expose the real instances of white supremacy in our lives. attaway and the other group members used quotes and anecdotes from UW students to cover the signs placed on Bascom PERIOD Many of the quotes describe microaggressions individual students have experienced while on the UW campus PERIOD

Women feel extra pressure to prove themselves in maledominated majorsFor University of Wisconsin freshman Angela Houghtaling being one of few girls in her engineering classes is nothing out of Read

Some signs on the hill read This is not your country go back to Mexico Are you here legally and Why does everything have to be about race

Attaway said nothing specifically prompted the display but that the lack of conversation around the topic is the reason a display like this is necessary PERIOD

We felt the discussion two years ago has not been completed Attaway said referring to the hashtag TheRealUW that spread across campus to bring attention to the experiences of students of color and other historically marginalized groups on campus PERIOD

Monica Styles a UW graduate student and TA viewed the display as an artistic political statement made to start the conversation PERIOD

From my experience being quiet is not the solution Styles said PERIOD You may make enemies but addressing these hard truths is necessary  even if makes other uncomfortable. courtesy of Caitlin Attaway

Despite the importance of sharing student experiences Attaway said she and her group were expecting some backlash PERIOD

We want people to criticize it and start a conversation Attaway said PERIOD

Styles said she faced tough conversations with her students Monday PERIOD Many in the classroom expressed their belief that blaming whiteness is problematic PERIOD

In an attempt to open the discussion Styles said she tries to provide examples from different points of view and get them to question views they have readily accepted PERIOD

As an instructor I feel limited in how much I can express of my own opinions in class because I dont want to alienate my students Styles said PERIOD Its hard to know how to confront white people about racism but ignoring the issue or being silent are not options either. courtesy of Caitlin Attaway

Attaway said there are three things she believes people can do to combat this issue on campus starting with simply becoming aware of what a microaggression is PERIOD

Confronting TheRealUW Marginalized students reveal experiences of an unwelcoming campusLauna Owens a 19yearold black freshman at University of Wisconsin woke up slightly late for class Thursday morning in her Read

As a part of the display multiple signs on the hill displayed the definition  intentionalnonintentional negative messages directed towards a subjugated group  for all to see PERIOD

People need to be cognizant and willing to take criticism because words and phrases do have meaning Attaway said PERIOD

Being willing to correct or rephrase a comment in a more respectful manner is important she said PERIOD

Attaway said continuing conversations with friend groups and going out and making a change arethe remaining two of the three actions people can take to combat the issue PERIOD Sheencourages students and staff to continue the conversation online by posting with the hashtags RealUW and BreakingWhiteSupremacy PERIOD
