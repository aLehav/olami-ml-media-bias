Updated November     pm



By no means is this column meant to be all inclusive because theres much more wrong with America than I have the time or the energy to discuss but this is at least the issues most pressing in my mind PERIOD

American citizens no longer respect our military PERIOD Every year I work with the American Legion which for those of you who dont know is an organization for any member of the military who served in any period defined as war PERIOD  their motto says yet their country doesnt stand for them PERIOD We must work to protect our veterans and we as citizens must respect them PERIOD The next time you watch the news and see President Bush talking about his wiretapping programs or the PATRIOT Act and you scream out  why dont you first thank the people who earned those rights for you PERIOD Whether you agree with the war whether you dont like fighting and blood and killing it matters not those soldiers fought for you PERIOD They did the things that you should never have to do and saw the things you should never have to see PERIOD Thank them PERIOD Until we get back to the basics of respecting our military and those who fight for us our country will continue to falter PERIOD

American citizens no longer respect our flag PERIOD For five consecutive years the House of Representatives has passed with a  majority vote a call for an amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America preventing flag desecration and the Senate has yet to pass it PERIOD Ever since the Supreme Court errantly ruled in Texas v PERIOD Johnson  you are allowed to burn the flag of the United States in protest as an extension of your free speech PERIOD I go back to respect for our military PERIOD Many of my friends who are members of the American Legion served in Korea Vietnam and even one in World War II and when we sit down around the table and talk and the old war stories come out one remains the same PERIOD They tell me how they yearned to see the American flag flying while they were overseas but they couldnt PERIOD Protect our flag PERIOD

The American judiciary no longer respects its citizens PERIOD Time after time the Supreme Court has ruled in a manner which is contrary to one of the most basic principles of our country majority rule PERIOD Now while we must always protect the minority and ensure that they have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness within our country we cannot let the minority decide how our countrys laws should be shaped PERIOD Every day we face threats from a minority but most of those come in our governments references to God PERIOD All it takes is one person to make a complaint and one lawyer to pick up the case and God could be stripped from everything that is in our government PERIOD Now while Im not the most religious of people I recognize that the majority of America is and I respect that PERIOD Our way of life has hung in the balance with nine lawyers having the ability to do whatever they want PERIOD

Citizens of other nations no longer respect the laws of our nation PERIOD An estimated  million immigrants are in this country illegally and yet we as citizens dont seem to care PERIOD Where are our rallies against breaking the law Im glad that America is so great a country that people are willing to risk their life to sneak in and live here PERIOD Im glad I was born an American and I can understand why people want to come here but you have to follow the laws of our country PERIOD The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that . million Americans are without jobs while the Bureau of the Census says that an estimated  million people are in the country illegally PERIOD If those  million immigrants came to this country to work and make money to better the lives of their families why cant the . million unemployed find jobs America is the land of opportunity but its not everybody land its our land PERIOD We as American citizens should be outraged by the  million illegal immigrants in this country breaking our law and yet living off our tax dollars PERIOD Its time we fixed it PERIOD Put troops on the border with Mexico as a start to securing it PERIOD Build a wall and increase the number of Border Security agents so that we may pull those troops back but more importantly make laws to protect our people PERIOD Make it a felony to employ an illegal immigrant in any kind of work PERIOD This isnt hate this is protection PERIOD In no way am I saying these  million people cant come to America but Im saying they need to get in line PERIOD If we allow a  for  million people here illegally were rewarding their actions PERIOD Were saying  Its not okay PERIOD While it would be very costly and extremely difficult to deport  million people that is the only action the government can take that is right PERIOD

American citizens have forgotten about Sept PERIOD   PERIOD While were screaming about our rights and what we want and what we need we forget about the  people who died that day PERIOD We forget that this attack was an act of war PERIOD We forget that this is a new kind of war one where you cant identify the enemy by a different colored uniform PERIOD History is destined to repeat itself unless we remember it and prevent it from happening again PERIOD Now that  is getting farther and farther back in our minds we are losing our resolve to win PERIOD The War on Terror will be a neverending struggle between what is American and what is not PERIOD Terrorist fight against our very way of life they wish to attack the very fiber of our Americanism PERIOD Until we as a country unite again under a common purpose we are inviting terror back into our lives PERIOD Im a Republican you may be a Democrat or Libertarian or an apathetic but we are all Americans PERIOD

In closing I leave you with the words of a man who I consider the greatest American to ever live PERIOD Ronald Reagan said  I dont plan on telling my children and my childrens children what it was like to be free I plan on letting them experience it for themselves PERIOD
