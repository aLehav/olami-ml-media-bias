I said my safe word over and over again but nobody turned off the movie PERIOD Fifty Shades is back for a third round of uncomfortable sex scenes and melodrama to propel its problematic narrative PERIOD

Christian Jamie Dornan and Anastasia Dakota Johnson are now married and continue their luxurious lifestyle PERIOD Ana becomes the fiction editor of Christians publishing company which he purchased after its former editor Jack Eric Johnson began harassing Ana PERIOD Christian fired Jack who hatches his plot for revenge while the Greys continue to navigate the twists and turns of their troublesome relationship PERIOD

Director James Foley keeps the acting flat and absurdly unconvincing while various contrivances emerge in a futile attempt to hold the viewers interest for the films overstretched two hours PERIOD

In that time Freed too often misses the glaring point of what this entire series has been about sexual fantasy PERIOD Sure the sex still happens PERIOD A couple trips are made to the red room and some interesting things happen to a pint of Ben  Jerrys but those going to see the latest Fifty Shades will also be slapped with a lengthy subplot that deals inextortion and kidnapping

While its true the movie is adapted from the book plot development is an element this franchise could have sharpened on both fronts PERIOD If youre going to sell steamy sex with rich white guys sell steamy sex with rich white guys PERIOD At least give the audience their junk food on a silver platter PERIOD Kidnappings and car chases serve only to distract from the relationship at the trilogys centera relationship which again offers a harmful take on love. a rich and powerful man exploits a womans fantasies and desires while controlling as much of her life as he possibly can shutting her out whenever she objects PERIOD Of course they eventually talk things out and come to solutions that prove temporary when he inevitably reverts back to his overbearing tendencies PERIOD

In a society that is finally recognizing the toxic cycle in these relationships and its horrible impact Fifty Shades says Stay with that guy who doesnt let you talk to other guys PERIOD Stay with that guy who keeps you away from your friends PERIOD Stay with that guy who cringes at the thought of you having a life beyond him PERIOD Stay with that guy who continues to hurt you every time you think hes changed PERIOD Youre what he needs and you can fix him PERIOD He is trying after all. um no thanks PERIOD

Freed ties up the trilogy in predictably poor fashion even with uncompromising commitment from Dakota Johnson and a few glances of selfawareness PERIOD So long Fifty Shades PERIOD Dont feel compelled to return PERIOD
