8800,2023-10-05,"fiGli and IDEAS Center come together to start the Were First initative on campus

Jen Rodriguez Features EditorSeptember  

As young adults enter college some think back to the outrageous or gratuitous stories their parents have told over dinner tables or casual barbeques of the classes friends and activities they participated in reminiscing on the good ole days PERIOD Others will contemplate what is actually in store for them at college and how exactly they can pay for their own experience and for many who do come to college with no previous knowledge acquired from parents or relatives they usually dont find the help they need PERIOD

At Allegheny the First Generation andor LowIncome is the guiding hand for students who are the first in their family to enter a four year degree program or come from an lowincome family PERIOD FiGLI aims to help firstgeneration or lowincome students in navigating college and being a platform to help connect students with faculty staff and alumni who have had similar experiences PERIOD

FiGLI held their first lunch meeting Aug PERIOD   at the Tippie Alumni Center introducing the founder and copresident of FiGLI Winly Mai  and copresident Robyn Katona19 and faculty and staff that were first generations students themselves PERIOD They also introduced the Were First Initiative which aims to show there are firstgeneration students staff and faculty at Allegheny PERIOD FiGLI and the Inclusion Diversity Equity Access and Social Justice Center included yellow elastic wristbands with Allegheny College Were First at the meeting but they are also available on the third floor of the campus center at the Inclusion Diversity Equity Access and Social Justice Center PERIOD

A point of this meeting was to have the incoming firstgeneration or lowincome freshmen and returning students appear and know that they are not alone at college PERIOD Allegheny itself has many students faculty and staff that are firstgeneration students or came from a lowincome family PERIOD

The Administrative Executive Committee includes more than fifty percent of people who had been first generation. said justin adkins associate dean of the IDEAS Center PERIOD

Eileen Petula executive vice president and chief operating officer of Allegheny College gave her own advice to the group of students and staff gathered PERIOD Petula was a firstgeneration student as well from a family of eleven who didnt believe college was something she would undertake PERIOD However through the persistence of a guidance counselor she was accepted into college and began her journey as a firstgeneration student PERIOD

Dont be afraid to dream big PERIOD Dont be afraid to advocate for yourself said Petula PERIOD

Its not widely spoken about on campus or in regular conversation that people are firstgeneration students but FiGLI aims to change that PERIOD Its obvious through the meeting that a goal of FiGLI and the IDEAS Center is to help shed light on the difficulties that firstgeneration students deal with and the solutions for them PERIOD

With the assistance of faculty and staff FiGLI hopes to provide support and mentorship to the firstgeneration students of Allegheny and to help them navigate their way through college and its inner workings according to CoPresident Winly Mai  PERIOD

Most of all FiGLI and the staff hope to learn from each other in a way that mentorship goes both ways learning from both mentee and mentor PERIOD In their words everyone has some specific knowledge that another might not have and learning from each other helps them connect to one another in unique ways PERIOD
