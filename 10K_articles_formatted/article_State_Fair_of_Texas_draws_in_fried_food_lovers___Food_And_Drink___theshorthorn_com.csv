The Deep Fried Jambalaya at the Big Tex Choice awards won Best Taste PERIOD

If you dont get a turkey leg at the state fair its like going to Disneyland and not meeting Mickey Mouse said fairgoer Yami Furlong PERIOD

The State Fair of Texas claimed its fame with many successes Its the largest fair in the nation is home to the 212foot Texas Star ferris wheel and has its own mascot Big Tex just to name a few PERIOD

One of its biggest draws however is the food PERIOD

With options from fried everything funnel cakes Oreos ice cream margarita balls  you name it theyll fry it everyone has an opinion to what the best fair food really is PERIOD

Candi Easley a huge fan of the Fletchers Corny dog said she likes the fried food just not the fried sweets PERIOD

Im just not a big fan of that she said PERIOD Its okay if you get it and a bunch of people split it but to eat the whole thing no. gracie Martinez who has been visiting the fair since childhood said she prefers the candy apples and funnel cakes as well as the corn dog and fried beer PERIOD

If anyone has the final decision its the Big Tex Choice Award the fairs annual food contest PERIOD

Although it is not a contest for fried food every winning dish from  through  was fried siadSue Gooding vice president of public relations and community relations for the fair PERIOD

Its a contest for something new she said PERIOD We give an award for the most creative and the best tasting food. why though is the food at the state fair such a huge deal

Its just I dont know Easley said struggling for the words to explain why the Fletchers Corny Dog at the fair is so delicious PERIOD Part of it is just the atmosphere that makes it better. one things for sure everything tastes better at the State Fair of Texas PERIOD So grab your stretchy pants and head over before it closes Oct PERIOD  PERIOD
