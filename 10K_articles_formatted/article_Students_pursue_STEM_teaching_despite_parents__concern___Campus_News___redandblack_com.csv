University of Georgia researchers published their first sunflower genome research in the journal Nature PERIOD The team will now move to the second part of the research to identify the genes that make the sunflowers more adaptable under environmental stress PERIOD

Thao Nguyen a freshman at the University of Georgia aspires to become a high school mathematics teacher but her parents are not as enthusiastic about her future career as she is PERIOD

My parents support me in my pursuit in the math field but they dont want me to be a teacher because it doesnt pay a lot Nguyen said PERIOD They heard from other people who keep telling them its really tough and most teachers quit within a few years. this goes in line with the results of an American Society for Quality survey conducted by The Harris Poll PERIOD

Among the  parents that polled  percent said they would encourage their children to pursue a career in a STEM science technology engineering and math field yet  percent said they would be concerned if their children pursue a career as a K12 STEM teacher PERIOD

Many parents polled said they worried their children would not make enough money as a STEM teacher that they might not be compensated enough for heavy workloads that they might not have many career advancement opportunities and that their career might not be worth the cost of a college degree PERIOD

K.C PERIOD Das professor of the College of Engineering said he believed ultimately parents did not want their children to pursue a K12 STEM teaching career because those who worked in STEM fields could get paid significantly higher than teachers PERIOD

To encourage more people to pursue any K12 teaching career Das said America would need a system where teachers were rewarded and respected more than they were now PERIOD

If we increase their salaries it will attract the best people keep them motivated and evolve the teaching styles to really cuttingedge he said PERIOD Also in certain countries there is a significant social respect for teachers that we dont have in this country as much as we could. das said he could have become a K12 teacher had he not gotten a university teaching post right out of graduate school PERIOD He said he found teaching more rewarding and less monotonous than working in the private sector in general PERIOD

Teaching is a lot of fun because you get to motivate people Das said PERIOD It doesnt happen every day but occasionally you run into a student who comes to you with a lack of interest in a subject and leaves you excited about it PERIOD If you manage to catch that its very rewarding. chassity Wilkerson senior middle grades Math and English education major shares a similar passion for teaching PERIOD

A big incentive for becoming a teacher is knowing that youre impacting a person Wilkerson said PERIOD Youre not just getting a check in the mail PERIOD Youre not just doing your job PERIOD Youre helping kids reach goals that they might not expect to meet. wilkerson said she had not experienced the financial difficulty of working as a teacher yet but said she was not too worried about it PERIOD

The financial thing might be an issue but at the end of the day Ill be doing something Ive always wanted to do fulfilling my purpose in life she said PERIOD

Trevor Talmadge freshman biochemistry major considered becoming a K12 educator but changed his mind PERIOD He aspires to become a STEM professor now PERIOD

I could so see myself fulfilled by being a K12 educator but I felt that I would be a little weary of stopping my education after four years because I really enjoy learning things Talmadge said PERIOD Now itd be better for me to become a research professor because I am more interested in exploring topics. amy Peacock the K12 Science Content Coach for theClarke County School District said there is a great need for STEM teachers because STEM fields are high in demand PERIOD

We need STEM teachers who have strong STEM backgrounds that allow them to engage students and develop within them a love for science she said PERIOD

Peacock said American society could encourage more people to become K12 STEM teachers by exposing more science majors to the teaching field PERIOD For instance Clarke County School District has a partnership with UGA called Project FOCUS to bring science undergraduates into elementary science classrooms she said PERIOD

Das said its important to encourage people to go into STEM fields because the most significant growth in any economy comes from creating new things PERIOD

Its very sad that people dont want their kids to be STEM teachers because ultimately you think education is one of the important foundations for a healthy society PERIOD If we dont send our best to go become teachers we are compromising future generations abilities Das said PERIOD

Nguyen said she understands the importance of teachers in shaping students future PERIOD

I love working with high school students because high school is the trial and error period where you experience things and you want someone to be there and guide you through it she said PERIOD

Nguyen said she seeks to make a difference by encouraging more girls to enter STEM fields PERIOD

I want to be there and encourage them because if they can learn to love the subject maybe they will consider going into that major more she said PERIOD

Nguyen said she is not too worried about her parents reactions to her pursuit of a STEM teaching career PERIOD

My stepdad helped my mom understand that this is something I want to do so they can put in their opinion but they cant force me to do what I dont want to do she said PERIOD They are still not happy with my decision of course but its fine PERIOD They will learn to love it or get along with it eventually. the Georgia House of Representatives passed a billHouse Bill  on Feb PERIOD  which will give students who take rigorous science technology engineering and mathematics STEM courses a halfpoint boost to their final grade in STEM courses if they get a B C or D PERIOD The bill now moves to the Senate PERIOD
