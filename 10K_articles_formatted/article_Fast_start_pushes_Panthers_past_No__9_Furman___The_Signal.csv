 Wednesday night at home PERIOD

Head coach Brett Surrency said We believe in what we do PERIOD Furmans having a great year but we have a bunch of good young players PERIOD Consistency has been our problem this year but I thought we played really well for two halves. the Panthers  got out to a quick start scoring their first goal  minutes into the first half PERIOD

Freshman forward Amiri Abraham scored on a long assist from midfielder Stephen McGill PERIOD Abraham scooted around Furman goalkeeper Sven Lissek after handling the long pass to score PERIOD

Abraham was not finished PERIOD He scored the Panthers only other goal giving himself a total of five goals on the season and making him the team leader in goals PERIOD

His second goal of the game came in the  minute all but sealing the deal for the Panthers in only their fifth home game of the season PERIOD

Abraham said It always feels good to get a couple goals but I think it was a great team effort honestly. abraham got the pass from Andrew Weber and scored the header with heavy pressure from the Paladin defense PERIOD

Abraham said the team focused on controlling the game coming in and this first shutout is a great stepping stone for the team PERIOD

Panther goalkeeper CJ Cochran finished with one save on four shots while Furmans Lissek had three saves on ten shots PERIOD

The Panthers ended the match with four corner kicks and six shots on goal while Furman ended with one corner kick and three shots on goal PERIOD

Georgia States defense was strong throughout and had possession for much of the game PERIOD Furman was not given many opportunities to score PERIOD

It was a very organized defense from Michael Nwiloh and Conor Acheson Abraham said PERIOD I really think theyre two big time leaders in the back that control our defense and let us know where we need to be. the win brings Georgia State to  at home on the season PERIOD

With four out of the five remaining games at home Surrency and the Panthers are looking to finish out the season strong PERIOD

Now well have four or five games at home and the guys get up for playing here PERIOD Were excited Surrency said PERIOD Hopefully the rest of the games can be as positive as tonight was. copyright    Georgia State Signal  By Daniel Varitek",Fast start pushes Panthers past No. 9 Furman - The Signal,Georgia State University
