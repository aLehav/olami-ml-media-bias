Internships during the school year are an integral part of the student experience at Georgetown preparing students for the working world and allowing them to try out different career options before graduation PERIOD One of Georgetowns major draws for prospective students is its proximity to internships in a wide variety of industries from government internships to privatesector internships PERIOD In light of the fact that a large portion of the student body participates in unpaid or underpaid internships during the school year  students averaged . internships by graduation in the  academic year  administrators should offer more academic credits to better recognize students who seek to learn outside the classroom PERIOD

Currently the four undergraduate schools handle course credit for internships very differently PERIOD The School of Nursing and Health Studies mandates that three of its four majors include a sizable and competitive internship as a component for their graduation requirements PERIOD Meanwhile Georgetown College and the McDonough School of Business offer a handful of internshipbased threecredit courses such as Public Policy Internship and Seminar Media Techniques or Internship in Business. in addition the College offers a onecredit course to supplement an internship in the public sector PERIOD The School of Foreign Service does not offer academic credit for internships unless a student gets a Deans permission to sit in one of the MSBs or Colleges internship courses PERIOD So for the majority of students who are not in the NHS there is no concrete way to translate the applicable skills learned in an internship into course credits beyond these meager course offerings PERIOD

A significant number of internships both paid and unpaid require proof of credit to hire a student PERIOD Georgetowns stipulations which often prevent students from receiving credit make students uncompetitive in relation to its Georgetowns peer institutions PERIOD Additionally internship classes that require additional coursework increase students workload in a manner that is not consistent to credit hours earned and further disincentives students from procuring internships PERIOD

Georgetown students need a stronger and better system on campus to concretely reward them for their internships PERIOD Easing the entry requirements in the Colleges onecredit course or partnering with more firms to offer threecredit internship courses would be innovative ways to tangibly demonstrate the importance of internships in the daily lives of students PERIOD Georgetown should recognize that part of educating the whole person should also be reinforcing through course credit the professional knowledge built in the realworld experiences that internships provide PERIOD
