TCU students put on yellow and purple headphones Saturday night for a dance party that could possibly change the future of theEnd events PERIOD

TheEnd program known for bringing comedians such as Demetri Martin and musicians such as Mary Lambert brought Headphone Disco to campus this weekend PERIOD

In the BrownLupton University Union Ballroom students danced the night away to an average of  songs PERIOD They danced to songs like Bailando by Enrique Iglesias  by Beyonc and ballads like Sias Chandelier. they danced with the help of headphones and two DJs PERIOD

I think its genuinely fun where you can just come out and look like an idiot and have fun with your friends and not worry about what people think of you Sabrina Harb secondyear biology major said PERIOD

Everyone received a pair of headphones that had the ability to switch between the two channels the DJs were playing on PERIOD

With the headphones on students could only hear the music of the channel PERIOD However without headphones loud stomps of dancing feet and students singing along with each other were the only things to be heard PERIOD

I dont think its been on TCUs campus at all Jesus Contreras a junior theatre major and director of membership for theEnd said PERIOD Its a different experience that makes people want to come out and enjoy it. fall 2014sNeon Paint Partyis the only event similar to Headphone Disco PERIOD

It is a really fun event Kellie Mossler a senior early childhood education major and director of theEnd said PERIOD Its kind of a new sort of deal and it encourages kids to try different and new things. mossler said turnout is very important for the success of this event but students completing surveys emailed to them afterwards determines future possibilities PERIOD

Through the feedback we get through our surveys we can decide whether dance parties are more popular concerts or comedians Mossler said PERIOD We take surveys very seriously and we really want to listen to the students. next up for theEnd will be Echosmith known for their tune Cool Kids. echosmith will perform at  p.m PERIOD on Friday Feb PERIOD  at the BLUU Ballroom PERIOD",TCU students dance in silence at Headphone Disco | TCU 360,Texas Christian University
