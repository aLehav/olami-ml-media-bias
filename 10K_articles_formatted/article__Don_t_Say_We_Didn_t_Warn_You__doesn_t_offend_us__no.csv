The funky monkeys is coming screams a sample on the first single The Monkeys Are Coming from Dont Say We Didnt Warn You and it doesnt get any more normal from there PERIOD Ranging from house to alternative sometimes even in the same song the dancepunk outfit Does It Offend You Yeah plays with a fervency that feels like a caffeinefueled freakout punctuated by episodes of calmness PERIOD Sometimes sweet sometimes intense and sometimes downright weird Dont Say We Didnt Warn You always finds ways to surprise and entertain PERIOD

Dont Say We Didnt Warn YouCooking Vinyl

Without a doubt Dont Says greatest attribute is its reckless and rewarding tracklist PERIOD For instance the wonderfully excessive John Hurt goes big with booming drums and heavy riffs as singer James Rushent screams Get out of my fucking way However immediately after Pull Out My Insides is almost tender in its vulnerabilit and is more than accessible enough to make noise on the Top  PERIOD

The variety doesnt stop there On Wondering British rapper Trip overlays a vibrant synthesizer with lines like I keep seeing Bill Hickss ghost  he says World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones. the opening track We Are the Dead begins with a soft charming indie guitar but morphs into a fistpumping house beat PERIOD

The British natives break out to show their ability most in the more alternativeoriented tracks PERIOD While Pull Out My Insides could be the best song on the album the concluding Broken Arms is forlorn but soothingly beautiful PERIOD It culminates the record with solemn reflection PERIOD And while it might clash with other tracks it is nonetheless powerfully emotive PERIOD

Though the record boldly touches upon an almost innumerable amount of genres it never feels like its spread too thin PERIOD Rushents voice is distinguishable enough to tie together the tracks that contain it while certain guitar and synthesizer notes repeat throughout the album giving it a sense of unity PERIOD

Admittedly Dont Say does bow slightly at its center  probably because of its core of house music  but its at this point where Does It Offend You Yeah shows off its immense creativity PERIOD Though the string of songs isnt easy listening by any means it seems like material typical of the clubs where young Britons go for abundant drugs and the latenight strangeness that follows PERIOD For instance while its not exactly singleworthy The Monkeys Are Coming actually makes a beat out of what would otherwise sound like a Barrel of Monkeys commercial and happens to sample a popular Internet meme in the process PERIOD

With its sophomore release Does It Offend You Yeah proves that the popularity of 2008s You Have No Idea What Youre Getting Yourself Into was entirely deserved PERIOD The band is clearly on an upward trend  their first U.S PERIOD headline tour was completely soldout  and their newfound fame has accumulated opportunities to tour with the likes of Linkin Park and The Prodigy among others PERIOD With their unique adeptness in a breadth of genres Does It Offend You Yeah has many plausible paths from here all of which are bright with potential PERIOD
