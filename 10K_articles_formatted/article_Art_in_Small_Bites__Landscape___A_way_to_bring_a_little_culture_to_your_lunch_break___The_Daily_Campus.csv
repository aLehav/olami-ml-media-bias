This weeks edition of Art in Small Bites was lead by tour guide Nancy Silander PERIOD She introduced landscape through two paintings from the nineteenth century Boston Navy Yard and Low tide by the artists Dwight W PERIOD Tryon and Ernest Lawson respectively PERIOD

Silander made the tour incredibly interactive keeping it centered mainly on participants questions and observations PERIOD

What you see on a painting is an artists conversation with the viewer Silander said PERIOD

Every person on the tour noticed different things about the painting PERIOD With Silander providing background on the time period artists and painting techniques the two paintings were analyzed pretty thoroughly PERIOD

Tryon was a selftaught American painter at the time that he made this painting in  who painted largely tonalist paintings PERIOD Boston Navy Yard was painted in mainly muted colors which gave it the impression of an early foggy morning PERIOD It consisted of a largely empty version of the Boston Navy Yard with only two people in view in the entire painting PERIOD Silander pointed out that Tryon probably felt that people were unimportant in landscape she also explained that Tryon likely sketched the painting by the water but then returned to his home to actually paint it PERIOD This meant that the painting turned out as a more idealized landscape in which Tryon omitted certain aspects of the Boston Navy Yard so he could focus more on technique PERIOD His largest focus in this painting was playing with light and reflection on the water PERIOD His style of painting was very smooth with all of the colors thoroughly blended to bring about a more realistic appearance PERIOD

Lawsons painting was very different PERIOD He had trained under postimpressionists and impressionists in Paris so his landscape embraced the strokes of his paint brush with no attempt to blend the colors PERIOD Unlike Tryon tubes of oil paint had been begun to be manufactured by the time of Low Tide in  so Lawson was able to paint it on scene PERIOD This meant that the colors used in the painting were much more true to the landscape than in Tryons PERIOD Despite this his use of impasto laying out the paint thickly to give the picture a more textured appearance as well as the way he makes the buildings in the background into simple geometric shapes makes the painting far less realistic PERIOD Lawsons goal in his painting was to capture nature before it became destroyed by industrialization PERIOD This is shown in Low Tide in how he made the marsh take up threefourths of the painting with the city likely New York just an entity creeping up in the background PERIOD

I think I liked the more impressionist painting just because the use of colors Alyssa Pagan a secondsemester political science major said PERIOD I think its really interesting and to not have it be so realist kinda gives you a more abstract idea of what they were looking at. you dont need to be an art major to go to the Benton its open to all and willing to introduce art to anyone willing to learn PERIOD

Learned some technical stuff Harry Zehner a secondsemester political science major said PERIOD I dont come to the Benton that often so its cool to come here and see the art that UConn has. pagan agreed wholeheartedly PERIOD

I think its nice to go to galleries and talk to people who give tours just because you learn more of the technical side of things and how they did the paintings and where they got their education Pagan said PERIOD I think thats really interesting. the Benton holds Art in Small Bites every Wednesday from  a.m PERIOD to  a.m. so make sure to check it out before summer break
