If next weeks inauguration extravaganza goes off without a hitch the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority will be the unsung hero PERIOD But I doubt the fourday celebration of our forty-fourth president will go entirely as anticipated PERIOD

Transportation planners are projecting crowds of about two million and the task of moving these masses in and out of the same milelong stretch in downtown Washington seems to have caught WMATA off guard PERIOD With main roads and bridges into Washington closed to car traffic tourists and other inauguration watchers will be forced onto overcrowded buses and trains PERIOD

The Washington Post is reporting possible delays of up to eight hours and Metro is telling visitors staying within a twomile radius of the inauguration site that walking will be faster than riding PERIOD For fans of gallows humor check out a recent Washington Post inauguration blog post titled Poll Suggests Wave of Humanity Will Crush D.C PERIOD to Rubble. perhaps the doomsayers who predicted that Obamas election would bring Armageddon were on to something PERIOD

Public transit meltdowns occur in cities across the nation PERIOD On Oct PERIOD  hundreds of thousands of people were stranded in Philadelphia after the regional rail service was overwhelmed by crowds celebrating the Phillies World Series win PERIOD Philadelphias transit system was barely able to operate at about  percent over its daily capacity of one million Washington is being asked to move millions of people when peak ridership is just over  in one day and capacity is  people per hour PERIOD

If nothing else the coverage of the inauguration provides a chance to discuss perhaps the most unglamorous aspect of urban living  transportation PERIOD Not many people give much thought to the mundane business of getting from point A to point B PERIOD Schools policing parks gentrification  these are the policy issues on most peoples minds PERIOD

Transportation and infrastructure are just expected to work traffic lights subways electricity and faucets are just not in the same category as crime and education PERIOD But perhaps we need to change our way of thinking when our bridges are collapsing and your average Metro commuter can expect delays. americas love affair with the automobile is no secret PERIOD Ever since General Motors bought up all the streetcar companies in the 1950s and began tearing up tracks we Americans have been guzzling gas and paving paradise PERIOD Now half a century later in the middle of a bad breakup due to erratic gas prices and impending environmental calamity public transportation is everyones favorite rebound PERIOD Oh how they come crawling back PERIOD

Ridership has increased in transit systems across the country PERIOD Metros numbers were up  percent between July and October  and up  percent in November PERIOD

But while increasing ridership is as good for the environment as it is for commuters pocketbooks we have yet to make transportation policy a priority PERIOD That means increased demand but decreasing quality of service outdated transportation infrastructure and overburdened transit systems PERIOD While roads and highways have dedicated funding sources on local state and federal levels transit projects languish for years without securing funding PERIOD The Washington areas two premier transit projects the proposed Metro Silver line to Dulles Airport in Virginia and the Purple line lightrail proposal in suburban Maryland have been in the planning stages for decades their fortunes rising and falling with government balance sheets PERIOD Meanwhile congestion on area roads has only increased PERIOD

A centerpiece of Presidentelect Obamas economic recovery plan is creating jobs and reducing our energy dependence by retrofitting and modernizing old bridges roads and public buildings PERIOD But what our nation needs is not merely a revamping of existing infrastructure but the creation of new more environmentally and economically sound ways of getting around PERIOD That means finding the money to construct and operate the many transit projects that are currently backlogged  among them the Silver line the Purple line and the Corridor Cities Transitway in northern Montgomery County PERIOD

It also means supporting highspeed intercity passenger rail as a viable alternative to our national highway system as well as more robust funding and major upgrades for our existing public transit infrastructure especially for those systems where revenues cannot keep pace with rising operating costs PERIOD

While all of this may seem too expensive against the backdrop our economic realities every dollar of public money invested in mass transit yields up to  in benefits PERIOD We need to take this opportunity to make public transportation a more efficient attractive and viable alternative PERIOD
