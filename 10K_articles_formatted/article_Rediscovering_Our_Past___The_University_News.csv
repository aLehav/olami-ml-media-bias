A friend and fellow journalist gave me some professional advice this summer PERIOD One of his more profound tips was encouragement to travel abroad and see the world PERIOD Luckily I had the opportunity to do that this summer PERIOD In a months period I sailed from Okinawa to Subic Bay in the Philippines and finally reached Pattaya Beach in Thailand PERIOD

I toured Okinawa at night in the cramped confines of a small Japanese minivan along with seven other people and their luggage as we were driving from the airport to where our ship was docked PERIOD Several days later we arrived in the Philippines PERIOD Subic Bay was an improvement over Okinawa PERIOD After almost a century of American influence and military presence the Filipino government managed to convince the U.S PERIOD to pack up its bags and move out of country PERIOD Being part of the largest contingent of Americans to visit the Philippines since the withdrawal in the 1990s we were welcomed warmly by the Filipinos PERIOD

The Subic Bay area with its restaurants and luxury hotels has slowly transformed into a resort area that often attracts visiting ships and wealthier citizens PERIOD Buildings left unmaintained however were a stark contrast compared to the larger and wellkept churches PERIOD

My third destination was Pattaya Thailand and by far the best of the three locations PERIOD The Thai people had a friendly attitude toward our visit PERIOD The Thai food drinks and sights take the prize and are well worth the trip overseas PERIOD It might sound as though these places are similar to one another or to the United States but when I returned to the United States and had the best beer I had drank in a month I noticed the difference between our country and the places I had visited PERIOD

I felt important while overseas PERIOD People wanted me PERIOD Well they wanted my money but they had to win me over to get it PERIOD Storekeepers tried to sell me their wares PERIOD After a purchase they would comfort me or offer me something to drink PERIOD They did this to complete the experience in order for us to tell our friends about the place PERIOD Tailors would offer to make you a suit for  PERIOD If you were to be leaving the next day they would make you the suit that night so you could pick it up before leaving PERIOD Women would grab your arms and pull you into bars PERIOD Taxi drivers called for you rather than you having to call for them PERIOD The people wanted and needed your business and would do almost anything to get it PERIOD

All three destinations were fascinating PERIOD As a political science major and history buff the trip was great PERIOD For others the opportunity was not as fulfilling PERIOD

These were the people who lacked an appreciation for the history around them PERIOD I had to deal with this issue with a shipmate PERIOD

We were anchored off the shore of the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines PERIOD Off the ships starboard side I could see the island of Corregidor and a manmade fort that had been built in the middle of the channel connected by a tunnel under the water between it and Corregidor PERIOD

A guy asked me about the island and its significance PERIOD I explained to him what I knew of the island PERIOD

Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec PERIOD   the Japanese attacked and captured the Philippines and most of the U.S PERIOD military stationed there PERIOD Of the U.S PERIOD strongholds Corregidor held out the longest before having to surrender PERIOD In what would later be called the Bataan Death March captured Americans from Corregidor and Bataan were forced to march from the peninsula to Manila PERIOD Many of them died of starvation and disease PERIOD

I soon realized that the man had little knowledge of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor or that Japan at the time of the attack was a major military and industrial power PERIOD This was not a stupid man PERIOD He was very thorough in his work but did not know the history of the places that he was visiting PERIOD

I can understand that not everyone can or wants to appreciate history or the significance behind places and events but being ignorant is something that I cannot understand or condone PERIOD
