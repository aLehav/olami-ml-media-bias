Its been growing said captain Tristan Van De Moortele PERIOD Overseas its growing like in Europe and Japan PERIOD And while it started here those other regions around the world are definitely exploding. this past week final roster decisions were made for the Grey Ducks PERIOD The new recruits have a lot to live up to as the team seeks to qualify for nationals after several players from last years team graduated out PERIOD Current cocaptains Saurav Dubey Sam Kaminsky and Van De Moortele say the team looks promising PERIOD

All three noted that while the team lost key players it was a roster that had potential PERIOD Theyre not only optimistic about the team but also the growth the sport has seen over the years  a growth that has been hard to ignore PERIOD

I started playing when I was in seventh grade Kaminsky said PERIOD Ive seen it go from a few teams to now Minneapolis being one of the biggest youth scenes in the country for ultimate frisbee. according to USA Ultimate the United States national governing body for the sport of ultimate Minnesota ranks third in the country for participants PERIOD With more and more participation ultimate has been gaining attention and respect as a sport PERIOD



The Grey Ducks play at TCF Bank Stadium as spectators are drawn to the sport that combines the nonstop movement of soccer with the passing skills of football PERIOD Like football and soccer before it theres a professional ultimate scene growing PERIOD

Even past college theres a pro scene thats starting to grow in the American Ultimate Disc League Dubey said PERIOD Now there are ESPN contracts PERIOD They just showed a game on ESPN2. the three captains admitted that while the professional scene has been garnering more attention theres still a long journey that ultimate has to make if it ever wants to reach the same status as other more established sports PERIOD From funding to player participation ultimate is facing an uphill battle but its a battle they believe they can eventually win PERIOD

Itll take time Dubey said PERIOD
