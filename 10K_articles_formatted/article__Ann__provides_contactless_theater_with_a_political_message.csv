Feisty sharp ballsy and vulgar  these are the words audience members at Richmonds Firehouse Theatre use to describe the late politician Ann Richards PERIOD

As the first female Democratic governor of Texas from  Richards advocated for womens rights supported the prochoice movement and encouraged civic engagement for everyone PERIOD Written by Holland Taylor Ann is a biographic look into Richards personal and professional lives PERIOD

The show began its fourmonth Broadway run in  at the Lincoln Centers Vivian Beaumont Theater PERIOD Ann came to Firehouse Theatre as the third show of its  season and started its run on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

She was known for her devotion to people of all stripes and colors and sizes and she created a government in Texas that was representative of the people said actress Jacqueline Jones who stars in the titular role PERIOD She hired all walks of life to be part of her government and the people really admired her and loved her for that. in order to comply with social distancing measures Firehouse Theatre limited the number of audience members permitted to attend each show PERIOD The maximum capacity grew from two to eight people as dates progressed PERIOD To accommodate tickets quickly selling out the theater also offers livestreamed performances on select nights PERIOD

The main idea of our contactless performance is stay away from everyone producing artistic director Joel Bassin said in his preshow announcements PERIOD

Stage manager Grace Brown said the theater also takes audience temperatures before entry sanitizes the building everyday requires masks to be worn at all times and limits the production crews size PERIOD

Additionally audience members are socially distanced and can preorder contactless drinks PERIOD

Everybody has a number Jones said PERIOD Your number is your seat your number is your bathroom and your number is your little slice of space on the bar. brown said the onewoman show was an ideal fit because of social distancing requirements and its political message during an election year PERIOD

With a minimal audience size Brown and Jones cited a noticeable difference in energy levels compared to full house shows of the past PERIOD Despite this both said the reduced crowd brought some advantages PERIOD

Its a lot easier to know when everybody has arrived or just having a good idea of where everybody is and whats going on Brown said PERIOD

The limited capacity gave Jones the ability to create a more intimate experience for her audience PERIOD

Its kind of nice because I can address individuals more specifically Jones said PERIOD Thats kind of exciting to feel like I can connect more on a personal level. director Billy Christoper Maupin of Firehouse Theatre approached Jones in  with the idea of producing Ann. in his directors note Maupin wrote that after watching a production of Ann on PBS for the first time he wanted to produce the play himself and had Jones in mind for the lead role PERIOD

The show runs for approximately one hour and  minutes with a brief intermission at the onehour mark PERIOD Except for dialogue with the offstage voice of Richards secretary Nancy Kohler  played by VCU voice and speech instructor Erica Hughes  Jones delivers a fastpaced monologue with little rest for the full duration of the show PERIOD

Her mind goes a million miles a minute and the script is actually written like that with personal selfinterruptions Jones said PERIOD You see how fast she thinks. jones said performing the breathless script is exciting. she prepared for the role by reading Richards autobiography watching interviews and speeches that Richards gave and working with Hughes as a dialect coach PERIOD

The play highlights Richards vulgar humor and sharp wit PERIOD Despite the small attendance size each joke was met with resounding laughter PERIOD

The show draws to its conclusion with a passionate message about the importance of participating in government PERIOD The moment involves Jones pacing the stage as she directly addresses the audience and stresses the value of an individuals right to vote  a message that is especially potent leading up to the Nov PERIOD  election PERIOD

We have to quit whining and start participating Jones said during the show as Richards PERIOD

The final performance of Ann will be livestreamed Oct PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD For more information visit the Firehouse Theatres website at firehousetheatre.organn PERIOD
