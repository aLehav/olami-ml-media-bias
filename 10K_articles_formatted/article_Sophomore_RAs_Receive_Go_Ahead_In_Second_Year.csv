We knew that we would need a larger staff this year with the addition of the Southwest Quadrangle Harris said PERIOD Therefore it made sense to offer the position to sophomores. being a sophomore RA could get trickier in residence halls such as Kennedy Reynolds or McCarthy however where younger RAs could have to regulate members of their own class and juniors and seniors PERIOD
I think that it would be much harder to enforce upperclassmen Navarro who is an RA only to freshmen said PERIOD All freshman RAs deal with GERMings freshmen try new things out make new friends and have more roommate problems but theyre more likely to talk to the RA PERIOD There are huge differences between being a freshman and an upperclassman RA. despite this Kennedy RA Shermica Farquhar MSB  has had no problems PERIOD
I have a great floor she said PERIOD It may be hard for others but I have had no discipline issues PERIOD The thing is you have to be mature to be picked to be an RA so class year doesnt really matter she said PERIOD
Farquhar has had to write up classmates as well as juniors and seniors PERIOD
I did have an encounter with a person I had class with but you have to do your job PERIOD As a sophomore I know a lot of people in this dorm but you have to keep your job separate she said PERIOD If people are being stupid you have to write them up and if theyre your friends theyll respect you anyway. so far class year hasnt seemed to make any negative difference in the effectiveness of the RA PERIOD
We will continue to offer the position to sophomores at least through next year Harris said PERIOD There is no talk about changing that decision in the foreseeable future PERIOD To my knowledge there have not been any problems with sophomore RAs regulating upperclass students. kennedy Hall Director Brenda Nimoh Rogers sees no difference between sophomore RAs and upperclassmen RAs PERIOD
I dont think it is more or less difficult to be a sophomore RA she said PERIOD We look for the same qualities in all RAs regardless of their year maturity leadership community builder a sense of integrity and a wellrounded individual who is open to diversity. stephanie Navarro SFS  has kids lots of them PERIOD Raucous and rowdy many of them drink need help with their classes vomit have their stuff stolen break things and rarely clean their rooms PERIOD
