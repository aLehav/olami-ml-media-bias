I found the results of the Academy Awards Berry satisfying PERIOD I was rooting for Halle Berry to win best actress Oscar from the beginning PERIOD Her performance in Monsters Ball unveiled an amazing repertoire of acting ability shed never displayed before PERIOD Possibly this stemmed from the types of roles she had been saddled with previously PERIOD

Berrys performance ranged through a full palette of emotional hues sullen despair anguish sorrow hysteria denial rage disbelief depression confused inebriation lust tenderness and finally resigned acceptance PERIOD I found her work electrifying PERIOD I tuned into the televised awards something I seldom do principally in hope I would witness her victory PERIOD The wise money had been on Sissy Spacek for In the Bedroom one of the few nominated movies I didnt see so I cant make a comparison PERIOD But I found it hard to believe anyone could top Berrys work in this role PERIOD Billy Bob Thornton provided the perfect backboard for Berry to rebound from so he deserves some of the credit PERIOD

Yes I like many felt a tear creep into my eye after I saw her almost shocked reaction when she heard her name announced PERIOD Her emotion rang real PERIOD That alone endeared her to me as compared with the boring and predictable reactions of most of the winners with their feigned enthusiasm PERIOD

Berry drew criticism for her acceptance speech but the woman obviously dealt with intense feelings PERIOD Really now her speech was timed for only three minutes surely not excessive in view of the significance of the moment the first ever black woman ever to win the best actress Oscar PERIOD The fact that in her excitement she mentioned her lawyer twice drew criticism in morningafter critiques PERIOD That seemed to me a niggling comment PERIOD Even as she stepped away from the lectern her obvious excitement and disbelief radiated itself to viewers in a singularly genuine way a genuine emotion too often lacking in these awards programs PERIOD

As for the male actor I found satisfaction there too PERIOD From the beginning Entertainment Weekly magazine saw this as a twoman race between Denzel Washington for Training Day and Russell Crowe for A Beautiful Mind. i didnt see Training Day but Washington has produced a body of distinguished work and has rated for a long time as one of the industrys outstanding actors PERIOD His victory in the voting may have reflected to some degree the Academy memberships distaste for the posturing and antics of Crowe PERIOD

Unfortunately after Berry and Washington collected their awards the media began speculating as to the significance of the victory of two black actors PERIOD For some reason there has to become a search for meaning. the Oregonian dramatized this phony issue in its Pie Fight feature PERIOD Readers were asked to select from the following choices After Denzel Washingtons and Halle Berrys Oscar triumphs has a door to diversity in movies really been blasted open or will Hollywood revert to business as usual The obvious answer Hollywood will always do business as usual PERIOD Whether black actors will now win more awards will depend on the roles they get PERIOD Until recently they havent gotten the roles that win the top awards PERIOD If Hollywood sees potential boxoffice in giving them these more important roles or if some producer is burning to present a film with those roles theyll get them PERIOD If not they wont PERIOD We cant forget that Monsters Ball was considered a little film not a blockbuster PERIOD And Training Day certainly didnt compare with Lord or Moulin for boxoffice PERIOD So there is hope PERIOD

As we might have expected the black film director Spike Lee chimed in with a cynical response concerning blacks as award winners PERIOD He hinted that Hollywood was merely patting itself on the back to say Oh that should satisfy them black people that should keep them quiet for awhile. i dont believe the victories of Berry and Washington amounted to the tokenism that Lee suggested PERIOD Reuben Cannon who in  became the first black casting director for a large movie studio sounded a realistic note PERIOD He said you have to be mindful that the only way Hollywood will change is if we permanently change the way business is done in Hollywood. not a good sign PERIOD

I did appreciate the fact that Berry did not use the term African American in her acceptance speech PERIOD Rather she chose to honor every nameless faceless woman of color who now has a chance because the door tonight has been opened. i find the term woman of color imperfect but distinctly preferable to the fad euphemism African American PERIOD Berrys choice of words echoed previous statements by the shows emcee Whoopi Goldberg who has stated publicly she does not want to be called African American PERIOD

The outcome of the Oscars leaves me with the confidence of a prediction PERIOD This represented no trend nor was it tokenism PERIOD It did make a significant statement PERIOD If black actors Asian actors and Hispanic actors can get standout parts they will win PERIOD It must have taken some courage to produce Monsters Ball. let us hope a similar courage will spread through the entire industry PERIOD But with the bottom line accountants in charge its too early to count on it PERIOD
