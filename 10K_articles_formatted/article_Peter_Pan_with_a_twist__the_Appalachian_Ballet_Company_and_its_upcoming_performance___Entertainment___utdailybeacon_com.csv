The Van Metre School of Dance will bring the classic tale of Peter Pan to the live stage in a fulllength ballet as part of their forty-seventh season this March PERIOD

Next weekend the Appalachian Ballet Company based in Maryville at the Van Metre School of Dance will bring the classic tale of Peter Pan to the live stage in a fulllength ballet as part of their forty-seventh season PERIOD

The nonprofit company puts on several shows a year A contemporary performance in the fall the Nutcracker in the winter and usually a more childfriendly ballet in the spring PERIOD This years spring choice Peter Pan is principal ballerina Kylie Morton Berrys favorite of the companys spring productions PERIOD

Berry has danced for  years PERIOD In addition to holding the position of principal ballerina of the Company she is a choreographer rehearsal mistress and dance instructor and she says that she loves every minute of it PERIOD

Its not easy to make this your career so it was something that Ive definitely had a joy for from a young age Berry said PERIOD But now dance is my life PERIOD Theres not much else that I would have wanted to do with my career PERIOD I love to dance PERIOD I love the art. berry is the daughter of the companys artistic director Amy Morton Vaughn PERIOD Berry grew up training in Knoxville at her mothers school and eventually began dancing professionally in North Carolina PERIOD After suffering an injury Berry moved back to the Knoxville area and decided to remain at the Appalachian Ballet Company with her mother PERIOD

I love the family aspect of it the most Berry said PERIOD The dancers are together all the time and Ive seen this growing up as a dancer in the company and Im now seeing it as an instructor PERIOD Ive kind of gotten to be on both sides now and we really are just a big family. rehearsals for Peter Pan began in December just after the Company finished performing the Nutcracker PERIOD This production will be the third time that the Appalachian Ballet Company has performed the show but this years performance will feature more than just ballet Not only will Berry appear as a flying Peter Pan but the show will also be accompanied musically by a local flutist and local men and women performing in a live drum circle PERIOD

Even if people have seen our Peter Pan before each time they see it I make changes Ive added some new costumes and some new elements Vaughn said PERIOD

The Appalachian Ballet Companys production of Peter Pan has been growing evolving and changing since its conception PERIOD Vaughn transformed what originally began as a recital for the Van Metre School into a 45minutelong ballet in  PERIOD The ballerinas were to perform in the newlybuilt Clayton Center for the Arts so Vaughn wanted to put on a memorable production to represent the Centers opening PERIOD

I started thinking wow wouldnt it be wonderful to fly Peter Pan in our new theatre as sort of an inaugural event so I took it and sort of got it to the next level Vaughn said PERIOD

The elements added for the  performance of Peter Pan have morphed the production into a unique show that includes other aspects of the Knoxville community PERIOD In recent years the company has collaborated with the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra and other local artists PERIOD This interaction between the local community and the company is valuable to Berry PERIOD

I would love to see more collaborative efforts between us and our community said Berry PERIOD I feel thats a great exposure for both audiences whether its the Appalachian audience or its the KSO audience or whomever to see something that they enjoy mixed with something that maybe they didnt know about PERIOD So its really great exposure and its fun its exciting. vaughn also views this public collaboration as a chance to excite the public about the companys art PERIOD Anything I can to get people turned on to enjoying ballet thats what Im gonna do said Vaughn PERIOD

The company will perform Peter Pan on March  starting at  p.m. and March  starting at 300p.m. at the Clayton Center for the Arts PERIOD
