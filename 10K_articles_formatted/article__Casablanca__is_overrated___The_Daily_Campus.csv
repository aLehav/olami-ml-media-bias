Whenever the phrase its a classic is used to describe movies films like Casablanca are usually brought up PERIOD Yet this Best Picture Oscar winner is far from a classic PERIOD

Directed by Michael Curtiz Casablanca follows a saloon owner named Rick Blaine Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca Morocco during World War II PERIOD One night an old friend of his named Ilsa Lund Ingrid Bergman comes to the saloon with her husband Victor Paul Henreid to see if Rick can help them get immigration papers to leave Casablanca PERIOD

Bogart is considered to be one of the greatest actors in the history of Hollywood however his performance in Casablanca was mediocre PERIOD He seemed flat and bored whenever he interacted with patrons in the saloon PERIOD When it came time to be romantic with Bergman however Bogart was able to capture the pain of meeting a former lover perfectly PERIOD While Bogart avoided being melodramatic and pretentious his melancholic tone throughout  percent of the film hindered his potential to be anything more than average PERIOD

Bergman on the other hand did a terrific job playing Ilsa PERIOD She was able to portray Ilsa as a wise and tired soul who is trying to heal a relationship tainted by her absence PERIOD Ilsa should have been the main character of Casablanca. her backstory of escaping wartorn Europe would be a great story and if given more screen time Bergman would have made the film more interesting PERIOD

The direction from Curtiz was good but not awardwinning like his Best Director Oscar suggests PERIOD What he lacks in shot creativity or framing he makes up for with clever camera movements and the use of flashbacks PERIOD

My main issue with Casablanca is not with the film itself but rather with its legacy PERIOD It is held as an alltime great film but in reality the movie is no better than your average drama PERIOD The romantic dynamic between Bergman and Bogart is cliche and the horrors of the Nazis are not displayed at the level they should be PERIOD

In comparison Gaslight a film that was released two years after Casablanca has a much more detailed and interesting storyline about a woman going through an abusive relationship and how she gets out of it PERIOD Unlike Casablanca Gaslight plays with expectations instead of catering to them PERIOD

There is nothing wrong with claiming that Casablanca is a masterpiece PERIOD In my opinion however there are far better films that explore the deterioration of romance PERIOD Movies like American Beauty or Brokeback Mountain highlight relationships that sour while also providing sweet direction and amazing storytelling PERIOD

If a studio were to remake Casablanca there should be more of a focus on the geopolitical climate during World War II and less on a zombified saloon owner PERIOD Have an arthouse filmmaker write and direct the feature and you have what could be an enhanced version of a socalled classic movie PERIOD
