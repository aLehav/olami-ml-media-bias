I think the University and the Institute of Technology could do more to both recruit women for the faculty and retain them she said PERIOD But theres been some increase in awareness of the problem. burger said colleges across the nation play a crucial part in welcoming more women to engineering PERIOD

I dont want to say you dont need money she said PERIOD You need money but you also need the will and the willingness of the institution to sponsor promote and institutionalize those programs. burger said she sees a new promise for engineering in todays techsavvy girls and hopes this generation will at last accelerate advancement of women in the field PERIOD
