AES short for Academic English Studies is an intensive English program whose mission is not only to provide rigorous academic language training but also to foster an attitude of analytical evaluative and critical thinking about issues that confront humans as global beings. aES formally began in  as the Institute for the Study of American Language and Culture ISALC PERIOD In  ISALC transitioned to a more departmentaltype program and became AES PERIOD

Today AES sponsors many events on campus such as the recent activities surrounding the twentieth anniversary of the Rwandan genocide and the Romeo Dallaire Scholarship a scholarship that brings a Rwandan student to study at AES for one year PERIOD AES also runs the Community Friends program incorporates community service into its curriculum and has numerous workstudy positions PERIOD In fall  enrollment at AES reached an alltime high with  students PERIOD

Every morning before class I enter Albany take the first left and proceed down a flight of stairs to a place many people probably dont know exists PERIOD It would be tempting to call it a dungeon but for the bright lights multilingual welcome sign and colorful decorations PERIOD This is where AES headquarters are where I work and where nearly  international students taking English courses at LC come to meet with their teachers deliver assignments or chat with Susan at admissions PERIOD

The hidden yet lively alcove of the AES office is an apt metaphor for the program as a whole PERIOD When I tell people I work for AES their typical response is Whats AES After two years of working for the program Im still surprised at the regularity with which this question arises PERIOD AES students use the same classrooms as undergraduates they can audit the same courses they participate in the same athletics clubs and musical ensembles and many live in the dorms PERIOD They are not hard to spot among our predominantly white and lately sunburned student body PERIOD AES students make up a large percentage of LCs espoused diversity and have ever since the programs beginnings in the early 70s PERIOD

Yet the same question was being asked then PERIOD The question Whats AES represents a divide that has always existed between AES and CAS students PERIOD Its not necessarily a problemno one is hurt by the lack of engagement between the two groupsbut the possibilities for and benefits from bridging the divide are at our fingertips PERIOD

Amal Mansour an AES student from  and history graduate of LC in  told me that when she was in school most undergraduates didnt know about AES unless they were rooming with an international student or volunteering with the program PERIOD Haruka Mori a current AES student on exchange from Waseda University in Japan provided similar insight albeit over  years hence PERIOD People in Akinpeople who are around international studentsknow what AES is PERIOD But most people dont. is the irony of the situation becoming evident

For a college committed to diversity and inclusion narrowing the gap between AES and CAS is one way to uphold the ideals we so eagerly champion PERIOD This starts with awareness PERIOD

If we are what the LC webpage says we arethe next generation of global thinkers and leaderswe are missing out on an opportunity that is right under our noses PERIOD This year students from thirteen different countries attended AES PERIOD These students who like you and me congregate at DSAs and eat at the Bon represent the untapped potential AES brings to LC for a mutually beneficial relationship PERIOD Spending a semester abroad is not the easiest way to gain some global perspective PERIOD

And the benefit is mutual PERIOD Both Amal and Haruka when asked about the best part of their study abroad experience speak of the deep connections and lasting friendships they made at LCfriendships that bridged the divide between AES and CAS friendships made with LC students despite cultural and lingual barriers PERIOD More than the high level of English they achieved at AES their stories attest to the possibility when realized for relationships built not on words but on the understanding that difference is only superficial PERIOD

In the words of AES director Joanne Geddes Whats important are the relationships established the ongoing understanding that we live in a global society and we have a lot to learn from peopleThats the kind of international relations and diplomacy that starts at this levelfuture diplomacy is beginning right here. editorinChief reflects on four years of service
