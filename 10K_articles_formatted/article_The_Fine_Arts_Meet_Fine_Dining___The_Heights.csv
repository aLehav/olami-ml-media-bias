A MultiPalated Taste Of TV

Food has taken the nation by storm in the last five years as evidenced by the slew of food programming that dominates TV today PERIOD Last night Bravos Emmy winning Top Chef wrapped up its AllStar season in which the cheftestants were put through grueling challenges like cooking conch caught in the ocean by hand on the very same beach that they snorkeled for the shells PERIOD Host Padma Lakshmi takes weekly glee in demolishing contestants self esteemwhen she delightfully utters It was a little dry watch contestants faces crumble into a million pieces PERIOD

Chef is far from the only program on TV exploiting a nations obsession with food and cooking PERIOD Paula Deen and Sandra Lee are the face of a growing everlarger generation substituting butter or booturr as the scrumptious Deen pronounces it for margarine PERIOD It isnt just their food that has swept up a nation howeverDeen herself buttermilks her burgeoning celebrity for all its worth with recent gutbusting appearances on The Today Show and a blog devoted purely to her riding things PERIOD The best submission to date is of course Deen straddling a giant stick of butter PERIOD

Today Americans like to envision themselves as foodies and critics alike offering up sage words of wisdom on contestants dishes on shows like Chef and the new Americas Next Great Restaurant without having tasted anything in real life PERIOD Andrew Zimmern has instructed us on the weird and wacky on his grossout Bizarre Foods PERIOD Persnickety Brit Gordon Ramsay was foodtelevisions answer to Simon Cowell a cynical jerk who took great pride in smashing peoples culinary dreams He even popped up on last weeks American Idol in one of the series most cynical moments to date. food has completely taken over pop culture in and of itself mutating into the newest creative outlets for artists to explore and experiment PERIOD Liquid nitrogen and alginates that morph liquids to gels with a quick stir have become part of the everyday vernacular PERIOD Today it is considered unimpressive to serve a dish like a hamburger with cheesenot without the flash fried cube of chipotle mayonnaise on top foodies might adamantly proclaim

Something is certainly to be said for the newlyemerging slowcooking movement that has been silently sweeping the nation PERIOD Starting as iconic chef Alice Waters response to a generation that traded family meals for fast food slow cooking is in a way a return to the good old days in which food was something to be celebrated not dissected and gobbled PERIOD It offers a healthy alternative to the chocolate hotdogs yes these are absolutely real and sixpound burgers loaded with disco fries as topping fetishized by shows like Man v PERIOD Food and Diners Driveins and Dives PERIOD

The movement has in a subtle way begun to influence the way television producers think about food programming PERIOD On NBCs surprisingly adept Americas Next Great Restaurant contestants are encouraged to think about the big picture of their restaurants PERIOD Here food regains a sense of integrity in a world in which it has been desecrated with oil and sugar PERIOD Participants learn the importance of organic and healthy options and the difficulties that come attached to their inclusion in chain restaurants PERIOD The show has thus far barely made a blip in the ratings PERIOD Perhaps Americas viewing audience is simply hungrily waiting for the new season of Top Chef Just Desserts PERIOD

Take A Bite Out Of Blogging

Although the food scene at college usually leaves me longing for my kitchen at home the world of food blogs  and there is quite a large universe of them  is always a delicious distraction although a dangerously taunting one PERIOD Topping off the realm of simply torturous sites is the aptly named Food Porn Daily where there are thousands of artistically arranged plates and delicacies PERIOD However this blog is pure temptation because there are no recipes for the dishes and no other comments PERIOD It is a worship of food pure and simple PERIOD

While I occasionally submit to this masochistic site the real time sinks in the food blogosphere are the endless recipe websites that not only display melting creations of wonder but also teach how to make them PERIOD Of course the chances of accurately duplicating the culinary feats are slim but you can get very unslim and satisfied trying PERIOD Among the best head chef instructors I have ever had but never met are Smitten Kitchen Tim Mazurek of Lottie  Doof and Helen Dujardin of Tartlette PERIOD These gods and goddesses of food all sport incredibly clean blogs that are easy to navigate and willingly share their delicacies in step by step recipes PERIOD

Posting with impressive regularity these sites are a scrumptious distraction and arguably the best way to find recipes PERIOD Cookbooks are all well and good and still make a great house warming present but food blogs update complex recipes or invent new dishes and publish with a regularity that printed books cannot match PERIOD Plus the unique flair and focus of each blog makes it a more personal collection granted that you can only be so personal over the Internet PERIOD Even the media at large has recognized this trend with Julie and Julia which was more about the personal struggles of Julie than about the food although the latter was still drool worthy PERIOD

But not everyone can take on the culinary mastery of Julia Child PERIOD And there is a blog for you too PERIOD For a glorious relaxation check out Stresscake with its tagline Exploring the bake and release theory. focusing on simpler creations Stresscake puts as many humorous food posts as it does delicious ones with satirical comments by the bloggers about his life PERIOD A recent favorite was the ingenious and simple Guinness Stout Float posted in honor of St PERIOD Pattys Day with hilarious anecdotes about the crazy adventures of the day PERIOD Bake or Break a selflabeled adventure for the amateur baker is another website focused on the process rather than the professionalism of the final product PERIOD Focusing on simplifying recipes from professionals like Fat Witch Bakery or Martha Stewart this site is almost entirely desert based and is pure heaven for chocoholics PERIOD

However there is also an entire other side to the food blog consortium the amateur restaurant critic PERIOD No one needs credentials now to air their opinions on restaurants and chefs or give recommendations for local eats PERIOD The College Critic and Serious Eats are two of these unofficial but so accurate that they should be official food sites that are fantastic resources for anyone in search of great eats in an unfamiliar place PERIOD Of course some sites are actually very well credentialed like Gale Greenes Insatiable Critic PERIOD The first female restaurant critic for New York Magazine Greene has gone completely online for her victual evaluations with blogs and tweets instead of print PERIOD
