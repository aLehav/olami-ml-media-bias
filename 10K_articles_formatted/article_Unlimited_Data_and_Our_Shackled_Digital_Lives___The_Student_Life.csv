When
I sat down this evening to write my column I had presumed that I would write a
review of my new smartphone the Samsung Galaxy Note  PERIOD How could I not My praise for
this new phone of mine would undoubtedly exceed the greatest paean any
marketing executive could ever hope to write and I wouldnt even be getting
paid for it My disdain for dispersing
free advertising however was not what made me change course PERIOD As I began to list the things I loved about
the Note 3the larger screen the greater access to content the more powerful
processor that allowed me to watch all the flash videos and download all
the few games I wantI began to see that there was a common thread to my experience
with this phone that were it not available to me would have radically altered
how I interact with the device PERIOD

You
see I have an unlimited data plan with Verizon PERIOD Which is to say I ampersona non grata in
the eyes of Big Red PERIOD I am the customer whom
the two largest cell carriers in the United States want to stamp out like a bus
beneath Godzillas foot PERIOD Why Because I use
that unlimited data to its full potential PERIOD For  a month plus additional fees for talk and text I have access to
highspeed internet wherever I want whenever I want and on whatever device I
want PERIOD Stop for a second and consider
just how powerful a statement that is anytime anywhere with anything PERIOD

While
it would be false advertising to say that the experience is perfect or
consistent Im looking at you Crumpler North Carolina the ability to
access highspeed internet anywhere you go expands the way you relate to
the world PERIOD Gone are fretting little
things like forgetting to print out directions not knowing how to spell onomatopoeia and any fear that youll miss any TV show that you can
stream PERIOD Gone also are bigger fears like
missing a deadline or a submission having to plan where you stay around the
nearest WiFi access point and not being able to get in touch with loved ones
or coworkers during a crisis PERIOD Especially when you add in the ability to connect a laptop a game
console or any other internetenabled device to your phones 4G data link via
a process called tethering unlimited data not only makes life easier to
live it makes life significantly more productive and connected PERIOD

However
for all its benefits the two largest carriers in the US are currently doing
everything they can to make sure that none of us have access to this
worldviewexpanding service PERIOD The
original strategy was to charge for data by the gigabyte for individual
devices but the model has progressed to charging users one flat fee for a pool
of data shared across all devices PERIOD Five gigabytes for you your iPad your sons phone your daughters laptop your spouses Kindle and the list goes on PERIOD If
I had purchased my Galaxy Note  under the terms of a tiered or shared data
plan I can almost guarantee that my focus would necessarily have shifted to
one of constant worry about what I could and couldnt afford to do given an
actions approximate data drain PERIOD A
Netflix movie I might remind you is on the order of two gigabytes PERIOD In other words a Netflix movie can drain
in one sitting all available data for an entrylevel plan PERIOD

The
carriers excuse for the tiered data policy is a simple one money PERIOD The common virtue of all capitalist
enterprises is alive and well as far as access to data plans are concerned and
the business model reflects the phone industrys obstinate refusal of
change PERIOD Thirty years ago the same model
applied to longdistance calling which is now a staple of all phone communication PERIOD Twenty years ago the same limited model applied
to all calls placed on a cell phone which again is now unthinkable given how much we as a population love to yammer on the go PERIOD When you consider the tiered data approach critically moreover it
makes no longterm sense either As both standard and enterprise consumers
continue to move to cloudbased storage and streaming decentralized access to
content it will become harder and harder in the coming years to do anything without connecting to the
internet in one way or another PERIOD If
consumers dont have access to enough bandwidth to take advantage of the cloud
everyone from major corporations to indie startups will suffer as will the
service providers who will lose business as a result PERIOD

Thus
my longwinded point is that if you have unlimited data right now fight to keep
it PERIOD If not dont go with a carrier that
would force you on a tiered data plan PERIOD Despite the fact that TMobile and Sprint both have significantly worse
networks than Verizon or ATT it will still be worth it to exercise your
right to access whatever you want whenever you want on whatever device you
want PERIOD The future will thank you PERIOD
