In a  interview with The Telegraph published shortly after the release of her widely acclaimed record Born to Die Lana Del Rey shared the significance her contention with mortality has had on her life When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father and everyone I knew was going to die one day and myself too PERIOD I had a sort of a philosophical crisis PERIOD I couldnt believe that we were mortal. over ten years later Del Rey continues to discuss death in her songs and explores this topic along with familial anecdotes on her newest album Did you know that theres a tunnel under Ocean Blvd DYKTTATUOB in a manner that feels deeply personal when compared to her previous work PERIOD

From the albums opening track The Grants Del Rey  known originally as Elizabeth Woolridge Grant  employs her familys surname in the title to establish their importance within the record immediately PERIOD She continues her struggle with mortality and memory by singing My grandmothers last smile Ah  Im gonna take that too with me in the songs bridge to show how she keeps memories of the deceased alive PERIOD The singer wishes to make it clear from the beginning that family has an important role in her life and the tracks gospel tones begin the series of various nods to Del Reys spirituality throughout the album PERIOD

No track is a more direct representation of the singers faith than Judah Smith Interlude a fourminute and 36second excerpt from a sermon of the megachurch preacher that also includes Justin Bieber in his congregates PERIOD For many listeners of Del Reys work references to religion are nothing new and add a further layer of complexity to her art PERIOD In the song just before the interlude AW Del Rey is singing about being the other woman another common topic in her songs PERIOD At first glance the artists songs are a walking contradiction to the life dominated with lust Smith is preaching against in his recorded excerpt PERIOD However this track sequence can serve as yet another example of the dialectical nature of the singers work and public image that illustrates her ability to place her songs in conversation with one another PERIOD Perhaps by arranging puritanical messaging in proximity with its antithesis Del Rey is highlighting one of the many reasons that make her music so appealing her ability to expose the ideological contradictions within herself PERIOD

The singers recent release comes after a period of relative silence last year which was a sharp contrast to her publishing of two albums in  Chemtrails Over The Country Club and Blue Banisters. while these works undoubtedly carry gems what makes DYKTTATUOB stand apart from her previous works is that it can hold its own amongst her discography whilst retaining the themes and elements central to her sound as well as writing PERIOD It hasnt been since Norman Fcking Rockwell NFR that Del Rey has released a collection of songs that feel polished and distinct PERIOD In fact the singer almost seems to acknowledge this with her inclusion of samples and a remix in her newest album from NFR PERIOD

Her sampling of the beat from the song named after her  album in the latter half of AW serves as a recall for fans not only in terms of melody but also ideas PERIOD She sings over the sample Your mom called I told her youre fcking up big time revealing she is still dealing with the man child she sang about nearly four years ago PERIOD The last few minutes of the album are dedicated to a trap remix of one of NFRs most popular songs Venice Btch. in addition to giving listeners greater insight into her religious views the singer is extremely candid about personal events and relationships PERIOD The albums focus on death and family reaches its apex in Fingertips when Lana mentions how she nearly drowned in her teenage years alluding to a suicide attempt while simultaneously referencing the death of her uncle I wanted to go out like you swim with the fishes  That he caught on Rhode Island beaches  But sometimes its just not your time. the intimacy of the album is further strengthened by one of the final tracks Margaret which presents as a dedication to the fiance ofone of the albums producers and Del Reys longtime friend Jack Antonoff PERIOD The track features Antonoff and the lyrics When you know you know make it easy to imagine the song playing at the couples wedding in the near future PERIOD Del Rey once again takes us into her life and the lives of the people closest to her PERIOD

There are many crosscatalog tributes throughout the record but one of the most noteworthy within the album is the call back to the midalbum track Kintsugi in the song Let The Light In near the works end PERIOD Throughout the chorus of Kintsugi the phrase Thats how the light shines in is repeated PERIOD Beyond its title the chorus of Let The Light In asks the people in the song to do exactly that PERIOD Kintsugi is a Japanese practice of putting broken pottery pieces together with gold a metaphor for how these tracks work together to tell the story of how Del Rey progresses in healing throughout the record PERIOD Kintsugi introduces us to the idea of the singer working on finding the beauty in putting the pieces back together and Let The Light In shows us that shes trying  offering a realistic and empowering message for handling setbacks in ones life PERIOD

Beyond its connection to an earlier track Let The Light In brings brightness into the later portion of the album whether that be in the subject matter or tempo of the songs PERIOD Known for her slowpaced ballads Del Rey never fails to stun fans when she dabbles in heavier basslines and higher BPMs from time to time PERIOD Fishtail Peppers feat PERIOD Tommy Genesis and Taco Truck x VB can be seen as the singers response to the fans that continue to demand that she infuse elements of hiphop in her songs PERIOD

DYKTTATUOB with its  tracks provides something for everyone PERIOD Topics the artist has sung about for over the past decade continue to be fleshed out and new ones are uncovered PERIOD The record serves as a testament to Del Reys ability to be at her artistic best when singing about herself at her worst PERIOD
