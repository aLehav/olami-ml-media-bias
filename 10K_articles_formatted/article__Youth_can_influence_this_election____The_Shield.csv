However the junior political science major said she finds people in the United States to be highly under informed PERIOD

There are a lot of people who dont feel the importance of their vote or dont think they need to be involved she said PERIOD

However Tanner Milazzo said this generation will have a higher voter turnout than ever before PERIOD

This generation is more aware of the happenings of the world and are more informed than generations in the past he said PERIOD The more people are informed the more active they will be. mixed media

To stay informed Milazzo said he keeps up with the news daily despite a distaste for the current coverage PERIOD

He said the media coverage is hot garbage for everyone beside Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders PERIOD

Senior Aaron Gottman said he thinks the media coverage right now is unfair PERIOD

He said the uniformed public eats up posts on Facebook that may not even show a glimpse of the truth PERIOD

Gottman a member of USIs Activities Planning Board said students often think their votes dont matter PERIOD

College kids are also too uninformed he said PERIOD They just dont care enough to find the information that actually matters to the election. mcCormick said social media is a huge outlet for her when it comes to keeping herself informed PERIOD She said it is the main place people discuss their thoughts on issues PERIOD

Despite finding media a useful tool McCormick stressed direct information PERIOD

I feel like watching the debates is really important PERIOD A lot of people can read the highlights CNN gives but thats really not right she said PERIOD Thats not really hearing what the candidate is saying and the way they are supporting their platform. eyeing the issues

McCormick said she pays attention to where candidates fall on issues involving human rights PERIOD

I look a lot at the way their morals are viewed she said PERIOD Not just their morals but the way they view people and their view of human nature. milazzo prioritizes liberty and free speech in candidates campaigns PERIOD

Those issues are the foundation of a healthy society he said PERIOD Owning property puts more power into the common mans hands PERIOD You have the right to a weapon to protect that property PERIOD You have the right to free speech so you can speak out against those that would take that property away from you. keegan Roembke who identifies as an independent voter said economic policy is his biggest concern PERIOD

According to the Pew Research Center partisan affiliation in recent years has changed PERIOD Based on more than  interviews conducted in   percent of the public identities as independent PERIOD  percent identify as democrat and  percent identify as republican PERIOD

Were at a really important time where we can either turn it around or its just going to keep getting worse the Student Government Association member said PERIOD Its probably one of the most important elections weve had in awhile. his concerns lie with the nearly  trillion debt the U.S PERIOD acquired PERIOD According to Pew in January   percent of Democrats said reducing the budget deficit should be a top priority PERIOD Seventytwo percent of Republicans agreed PERIOD

The percentages have dropped since  PERIOD

The freshman economics major said unless the country elects a president who is prepared to pay the debt and cut back on spending it will only get worse PERIOD

Roembke said in order for college students to care they need to see how important the election is for the future PERIOD

I think students that are interested in politics have certain issues that theyre passionate about he said PERIOD For me its the economy but some people are really passionate about abortion or gay marriage or the environment. choosing the right candidate

Roembke said people are interested in Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders because they dont fit the normal requirements for politicians. people are pessimistic right now and I think that shows with who is winning the primaries he said PERIOD I think people are angry about it so theyre voting for people that dont typically win. junior Aubrey Franklin said she will vote for either Clinton or Sanders but she thinks its possible for Trump to be elected PERIOD

Trump fuels his votes out of anger the Black Student Union member said PERIOD He is true enough to his feelings but he plays off of the reaction of American citizens. dakota Richardt is rooting for Trump and against Bernie Sanders PERIOD

Richardt said he thinks Trump is the frontrunner and will ultimately win the presidency PERIOD

He said he believes Trump speaks to student issues and he identifies the most with him because his healthcare policy will give students more financial security PERIOD

I believe the current mood of the country is that we need change Richardt said PERIOD For this reason I believe a Republican candidate will be elected. but for Teddi Rausch the idea of Trump as president is a rude awakening for the U.S PERIOD

Trump just won in New Hampshire and hes gaining speed from Americans who are still stuck in the 60s both policy and lifestylewise she said PERIOD

She said the current Republican candidates cant voice how they will fix current issues like the economy or foreign relations PERIOD They have also attacked organizations she supports like Planned Parenthood PERIOD

The USI College Democrats President said its saddening to see many young people disinterested in the election or easily affected by an older generation PERIOD

People would rather follow their parents ideals than find something theyd fight for she said PERIOD Its a downright shame. the future leaders

Franklin said it is critical that students vote in the election PERIOD

All students should know what is happening Franklin said PERIOD Colleges should take the opportunity to host mock elections have polling tables and create places for registration hosted by unbiased parties so students can be more aware. rausch said she often brings up being informed to her sorority sisters and classmates and wants them to be informed PERIOD

People want change but there wont be change unless voters turn out she said PERIOD

Richardt said the impact students and youth have on the election is up to them PERIOD

I do think that youth can influence this election he said PERIOD After all the youth are the future leaders of this country. mcCormick said not voting might be alright for college students but eventually students will be real adults with life insurance and taxes they have to worry about PERIOD

Youre going to care about the way the government regulates that eventually she said PERIOD

She constantly urges friends to vote she said PERIOD

If friends tell me that they arent registered I will send them the link to register McCormick said PERIOD Its really easy PERIOD You just have to take a few minutes and do it. damien Burge Matthew Sims Maddie West Sean Adams and Taylor ONeill Hall from an online journalism course contributed to this article PERIOD
