Considerable cloudiness PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm





Penn Wood High School in the William Penn School District PERIOD Landsdowne Pennsylvania on June   PERIOD Amanda Berg for the CapitalStar

Leaders in Pennsylvania school districts large and small are forced to make unthinkable decisions as they work within crumbling buildings triage educational resources and improvise a social safety net state officials heard this week PERIOD

Educators public school advocates a student and an economist laid bare the depth and breadth of the commonwealths school funding shortfall as a panel of  legislators and deputies from Gov PERIOD Josh Shapiros administration began the work of finding solutions PERIOD

The states Basic Education Funding Commission is reviewing Pennsylvanias public school funding scheme for the first time in eight years PERIOD This time it has a mandate to correct unconstitutional discrepancies in the educational opportunities afforded to children in the states poorest and wealthiest districts PERIOD

The takeaway from more than nine hours of testimony at hearings Tuesday in Allentown Wednesday in Harrisburg and Thursday in Philadelphia are that the funding shortfall is about  billion larger than previously thought PERIOD And simply putting more money into the system wont fix the problem lawmakers said PERIOD

What were recognizing is that there needs to be a combination of changes if there is going to be transformational reform state Rep PERIOD Jesse Topper RBedford told the CapitalStar PERIOD

Established by the General Assembly in  the commission is charged with convening every five years to review the states public education funding scheme and make recommendations on the distribution of core educational funding PERIOD

Funding the  A landmark school funding case put K12 spending on trial



It last met in  when it developed the fair funding formula used to distribute new public education money but meetings that should have taken place in  were postponed because of the pandemic PERIOD

The state has long relied on property taxes to raise a substantial portion of public education funding PERIOD But in February nearly a decade of litigation by parents and school districts over inequities created by the funding system culminated in a Commonwealth Court ruling which found that the system violates the state Constitutions guarantee of a thorough and efficient education for every child PERIOD

Ultimately despite knowing that all children can learn our system has failed to sufficiently prepare many of them for success in life Dan UrevickAckelsberg senior attorney at nonprofit firm The Public Interest Law Center testified on Wednesday PERIOD The systems failures are particularly placed upon the shoulders of low income children and children of color. matthew Kelly a Penn State professor who analyzed the states school funding system testified that the shortfall is about . billion or about  of what the state currently spends each year PERIOD

Although Kelly had testified in the school funding trial which resulted in the Commonwealth Court decision  that the funding gap was about . billion he told the commission that estimate was based on a  definition of adequate funding PERIOD That outdated definition did not include special education costs or other factors such as a higher percentage of students from lowincome families PERIOD

And so the estimates that I shared at the time were very conservative because of that Kelly said PERIOD

Much of the testimony the commission heard last week tracked what the court heard during the funding lawsuit PERIOD UrevickAckelsberg said its important for members of the commission to hear in practical terms what underfunding means in communities across the commonwealth adding that they may not have had the opportunity to closely read and digest the courts 800page opinion PERIOD

Six school districts sued the state in  in the lawsuit that led to the Commonwealth Courts decision PERIOD They include the Panther Valley School District in Carbon County where Superintendent David McAndrews said the local economy never recovered from the decline of the anthracite coal industry decades ago PERIOD

GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX

As a result Panther Valley School District is unable to raise sufficient funds even with one of the highest property tax rates in the state and struggles to hire teachers because it cant offer competitive salaries McAndrews said PERIOD And despite class sizes approaching  students and a desperate need for more classroom space the district is unable to upgrade its 60yearold elementary school that has no air conditioning and a leaky roof PERIOD

Our local taxpayers try hard to support our schools because our community is not wealthy PERIOD It is not enough PERIOD Not even close PERIOD There is nowhere else for us to turn PERIOD All this is why Im here to help you understand what the court understood that our kids deserve much more McAndrews said PERIOD

Superintendent Brian Costello described draconian measures to bring costs in line with revenue in the WilkesBarre Area School District where a quarter of the population lives in poverty and  of the students are economically disadvantaged PERIOD

With an  million annual deficit in the years after the  great recession the district cut all K8 art classes family consumer sciences and industrial arts PERIOD It also laid off every librarian  teachers and  paraprofessionals PERIOD

But districts like mine without local wealth to draw from are forced to choose between unacceptable options every school year Costello said PERIOD

Although the district has a new high school that replaced two structurally unsound buildings the bond the district issued to pay for the project brought an additional . million in costs that required the furlough of another  teachers PERIOD

The new school has a STEM science technology engineering and math academy with specialized scientific equipment that prepares students for college and indemand careers PERIOD

But when we only have three teachers to staff it we regularly have to turn away qualified students Costello said PERIOD

The commission also heard that the funding shortfall means a lack of resources in areas beyond the traditional role of educating children PERIOD With rising community violence and social pressures affecting students mental health the need for school counselors is greater than ever but inadequate funding means theyre in short supply PERIOD

Trauma is so constant that it becomes regarded as normal PERIOD Trauma is not normal PERIOD

 Ashley Cooca Philadelphia school counselor

Ashley Cooca a counselor in the Philadelphia School District recalled the Jan PERIOD   fire in the citys Fairmount section that killed  people including nine children PERIOD The tragedy struck BacheMartin Elementary Schools  children hard and Coocas colleagues and community counseling resources responded to care for her and her students PERIOD

But Cooca said that degree of trauma is an outlier in Philadelphia where a more subtle and nuanced trauma from gun violence drug abuse poverty domestic violence homelessness and abuse is the backdrop of students daily life PERIOD

Trauma is so constant that it becomes regarded as normal PERIOD Trauma is not normal Cooca said PERIOD

Children everywhere have the right to highquality mental health care Cooca said but as the only counselor for  students she cant see everything that her students experience PERIOD

Students need intentional preventative and responsive care PERIOD And we simply dont have enough school counselors she said PERIOD

Rep PERIOD Peter Schweyer DLehigh who is chairperson of the House Education Committee said the testimony reinforced the Commonwealth Courts findings PERIOD

What we learned was what  candidly  advocates like me have been saying for a long time is that we have been shortchanging our families weve been shortchanging our kids Schweyer said PERIOD
