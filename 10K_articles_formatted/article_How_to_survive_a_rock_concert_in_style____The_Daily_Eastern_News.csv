As a concert veteran Ive collected a bagful tricks of the trade along the way PERIOD From Stone Temple Pilots at the  Illinois State Fair to A Perfect Circle at the Peoria Civic Center Wednesday I know what to do to ensure a good time at a show PERIOD Now you can follow these simple tips to rocking out at any venue you choose PERIOD



Clothing

For me going to concerts is comparable to going to church service for religious types PERIOD My Sunday ok Saturday night best consists of a skirt and a Tshirt PERIOD Guys should probably forgo the skirt for jeans unless you have exceptionally nice legs and your goal for the night is to get beaten up by drunken homophobes PERIOD The more obscure the band on the Tshirt the better the shirt PERIOD Do not I repeat NEVER wear the Tshirt of the band you are going to see PERIOD That is laaame PERIOD Its also helpful to dress in layers PERIOD A crowded smoky bar or auditorium plus dancing equals high sweat factor PERIOD Another concert asset Ive found is a pair of bigass boots PERIOD Mine are black kneehigh and chunkysoled PERIOD These come in handy when the swaying pit is so crowded I cant find a spot to put my feet PERIOD The boots create instant standing room even if it happens to be on some ones shoes PERIOD

Beverages

Booze at venues is expensive I recommend throwing a few back before you leave for the show PERIOD This is if and only if you are of legal drinking age and will not be driving to or from the show PERIOD Depending on your tolerance this method can save you enough money to buy a cheap CD or an overpriced commemorative concert Tshirt at the show PERIOD Ladies can probably score free drinks all night PERIOD Which reminds me guys you should bring extra money for drinks PERIOD

Getting there

Make sure everyone has their tickets and dont forget directions if you need them PERIOD Also make sure the driver is sober and can maneuver under pressure in crazy traffic PERIOD This is a good time to draw straws for whos driving back PERIOD No one will want to get behind the wheel when the time comes I promise PERIOD

Using the rest room before you leave can save you from missing your favorite song standing in line for half an hour and scary bar bathrooms PERIOD However some places have nice rest rooms PERIOD I particularly enjoy the facilities at the House of Blues in Chicago PERIOD

Parking etc..

Highpriced parking is available at almost every venue PERIOD If youre feeling poor remember  isnt much compared to the cost of parking in the wrong part of town PERIOD When I went to see Primus last month our driver had three City of Chicago parking tickets tucked under his windshield wiper after the show PERIOD Another guy I talked to who attended the same concert had his driverside window shattered by a thief who took only the face of his car stereo PERIOD

Beware of No Parking signs They hide behind tree limbs and other obstructions PERIOD

Getting in

Many shows are not all ages PERIOD In this case some would say faux identification is the answer for underage fans PERIOD When using a fake ID these lawbreakers would say be sure to memorize all the information on it down to zip code and blood type especially if you are a guy PERIOD Also you can practice looking like the person on the ID PERIOD It helps say the aforementioned people not me mind you PERIOD

Just a note if youre feeling sneaky and want to smuggle in a camera flask or other concert accessories PERIOD They never search girls as well as guys PERIOD Do it at your own risk

In my case limping three blocks with a disposable camera shoved in my boot was well worth the pictures of Clutch and System of a Down PERIOD

Youre in

Maybe you can get there early enough to catch the opening acts PERIOD Most awesome bands do start as openers PERIOD If theyre not so hot you can pass the time by making fun of them PERIOD They deserve it after all because they bite PERIOD Ive met some really cool people by starting discussions on how bad the opening band sucks PERIOD Jawbox Veruca Salt and Mindless Self Indulgence come to mind. perhaps your constructive criticism will help the openers improve their technique PERIOD

This is also strategic positioning time which leads us to

Where to be

This is when you must really gauge your opinion of the band in question PERIOD If youre not a diehard fan scope out a standing spot or balcony seat and get there now because around the front of the stage many will eventually pack in and later smell like sardines PERIOD

If you stand toward the front chances increase youll appear in photos and video footage of the show PERIOD The claim to fame of a guy from my hometown is his photo on the back of the Woodstock II CD case PERIOD Other benefits include

Recognition You may get noticed by the band for your enthusiasm if you stick to the front PERIOD The singer could award you with a chance to sing or scream in the microphone PERIOD Which reminds me thank you very much Phil Anselmo of Superjoint Ritual PERIOD That made my night PERIOD

Freebies An up front spot gives you a better chance of scoring free fun concert memorabilia PERIOD This seems to happen to me at every show I attend PERIOD I have set lists from bands like Six Feet Under to Primus as well as Down guitarist Pepper Keenans guitar pick and a box full of drumsticks to show for it PERIOD If I ever get old and dont value this stuff anymore I can always sell it on Ebay.com PERIOD

Caution

Dont stand up front if you are short claustrophobic or cannot stand communal sweat PERIOD It is RISKY PERIOD I will never forget the time I realized I could actually die because of my positioning at a show PERIOD It was between Hatebreed and Slayer at the Madison Theater in Peoria PERIOD The drunkest 500pound metalhead proceeded to pass out in the pit smashing the terrified people packed around the stage PERIOD It took four huge security guys to haul his halfconscious girth from the area PERIOD Twenty minutes later I saw the same dude with a fresh beer swaggering in my direction PERIOD I promptly made a beeline for the safety of the balcony PERIOD

Beware PERIOD The perilous pit is where music lovers get agitated and evil PERIOD Moshing and crowd surfing can be fun PERIOD Its all fun and games until someone loses an eye PERIOD Or breaks a rib PERIOD Or a crowdsurfer kicks you in the head causing a bloody nose or concussion PERIOD If you decide to brave it brace yourself PERIOD Keep your arms down elbows out and both feet on the floor this is where the boots come in PERIOD

If you hang out in back to take it all in you can always dance around PERIOD Dancing is contagious PERIOD If no one around you is dancing its fun to see how many people you can influence to do it PERIOD Bob your head swing your hips and in no time youll notice the people surrounding you doing the same PERIOD

Provided you make it through the showCongratulations

Now wasnt that fun I know you cant hear me because your ears are ringing but the goofy exhausted smile on your face is answer enough PERIOD

Now you can purchase a Tshirt or CD PERIOD Youll want to save this for last so it doesnt get lost or stolen and you dont drunkenly set it somewhere and walk away PERIOD

If youre feeling up to it the band may be signing autographs in the back of the venue PERIOD At Pops Nightclub in Sauget near St PERIOD Louis a lot bands hang out in the parking lot after the show and talk to people PERIOD My drummer friend Aaron got to meet his idols Sammy Duet exAcidbath and Ben Faulgaust Soilent Green there PERIOD He has the pictures and hourlong story to prove it PERIOD

Let me know if you hear of any good shows coming to the area PERIOD I would be happy to go through this with you in person PERIOD
