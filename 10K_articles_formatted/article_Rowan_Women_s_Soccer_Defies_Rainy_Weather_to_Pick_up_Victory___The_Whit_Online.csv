7127,2023-11-04,"it was a cold and rainy night but that didnt stop the Rowan womens soccer team as they defeated New Jersey Athletic Conference NJAC opponent RutgersNewark and mother nature with a dominating  win on Tuesday Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

The first half started with a slight mist some cold winds and little offense from either side but as the second half loomed a storm started to brew and the Profs came out firing PERIOD

We know it wasnt the best of our ability freshman forward Olivia Giordano said PERIOD At half time we cooped up together talked about it knew what we had to do knew our strengths and we just settled down overall. the Profs got on the board early in the second PERIOD After a missed opportunity three minutes in freshman midfielder Ava Morales netted her first goal of the season to give the Profs a  lead with  remaining PERIOD

About  minutes later as the rain came down at its hardest Giordano netted her teamleading sixth goal of the season to give the Profs some insurance and a  lead PERIOD

Its obviously not conditions that wed like Giordano said PERIOD I could have had personally like three more goals but we needed to put one up to settle us down gain confidence again after that we just took it to them. the win improved the Profs record to  and  NJAC which is exactly where they wanted to be at this point in the season but is also just a stepping stone PERIOD

The whole plan was to go  in the conference Giordano said PERIOD Thats been what weve been focused on this whole year we just want to go    and just keep it going. on the defensive end the Profs were lights out only allowing one shot on goal the entire game and pitching their third consecutive NJAC shutout and fifth consecutive shutout overall PERIOD

They always say if you have a good defense you can win games Head Coach Scott Leacott said PERIOD Our defenders are just tough PERIOD Tough as nails and they like contact. leacott went on to praise his teams defense and credited their effort and excitement to play the game they love for their success PERIOD

Playing defense you have to be smart but its just hard work Coach Leacott said PERIOD Weve got hardworking kids out there who just love to play and thats part of it  Like tonight theyre like I cant wait to play they were all excited to play and thats a defenders mentality. the team will be back at it again on Saturday Oct PERIOD  for a huge matchup against their NJAC rival the undefeated Montclair State   NJAC PERIOD
