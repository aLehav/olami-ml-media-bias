It was a beautiful breezy evening as the sun set behind the stage of director Dan Gatelys production of Twelfth Night or What You Will or as most students and Turlockers know it Shakespeare Under the Stars PERIOD

Hundreds of show goers of all ages entered the University Amphitheatre and spread out their blankets and chairs to take in the classic comedy PERIOD

The preshow began with light 1920s music playing over the speakers but the entertainment lied in the actors and actresses making their rounds PERIOD

Dressed in their 20s garb they strutted up and down the aisles in character as they ushered in audience members PERIOD One actress was particularly inviting as she coyly welcomed patrons to join the party. as show time grew closer there was an energetic hum in the amphitheatre PERIOD Our anticipation was soon rewarded as the play opened with a lively tango PERIOD

This was not the only musical number of the night Gately promised a lot of music and he certainly delivered PERIOD

Sprinkled throughout the entire play were songs from various genres spanning multiple decades of music PERIOD The show was reminiscent of Baz Luhrmanns movies as it conflated modern music with a Renaissance play  but in this case it did not work PERIOD The music though it fit the themes of the play loosely distracted from the 1920s setting PERIOD

What was really disappointing however was Gatelys unnecessary change of Shakespeares original character Antonio to Antonia PERIOD Though Gately most likely did this to play up the romantic undertones of Antonios affections for Sebastian it completely changed Sebastians character to have him return Antonias feelings making him the sleazeball who led Antonia on only to abandon her when a prettier woman came along PERIOD

Not to mention the fact that it leaves Antonia as a loose end at the end of the play where originally Malvolio was the only character who was left without a happy ending PERIOD

As a whole the production was exceedingly entertaining and some of the special effects the backdrops projected onto the walls of the set for example were almost as significant to the story as the dialogue PERIOD

However it was the cast of energetic actors who stole the show PERIOD They could have been acting in front of a plain black curtain and they still would have had the crowd roaring with laughter PERIOD In particular Sir Andrew Aguecheek played by Kenny Roderick and Sir Toby Belch played by Paul Romero were a comical sensation PERIOD Their scenes with Malvolio Colton Dennis Mariah Murri Royal Brown Maria Paige Jenkins Fabian Michael Souto and Feste Ethan Hennes were crowd favorites PERIOD

Out of the lovers Laura DickinsonTurners Viola was a brilliant beacon on stage growing brighter with each comical and dramatic line PERIOD At times she outshone Duke Orsino her opposite played by Joel Bond  who spent much of the play dressed like Hugh Hefner in red satin pajamas and a blue smoking jacket PERIOD

Katherine Brokaws role as Olivia was a nostalgic reminder of silent movie starlets with her graceful dramatic movements about the stage PERIOD Her opposite Sebastian Luke Gonzales also gave a memorable performance as Violas longlost twin brother PERIOD His exchange with his sister upon reuniting with her was especially touching evoking several awws from audience members around me PERIOD

All in all I could not look away  at least I didnt want to PERIOD It was a sacrifice to deprive myself of even the few seconds it took for me to look down and make my notes during the play PERIOD

If this is the caliber of productions to come in the University Amphitheatre I look forward to returning to next years production of Shakespeare Under the Stars PERIOD
