9879,2022-09-14,"the Country Music Association CMA struck a chord and announced the nominees for the  CMA Awards which will take place this November PERIOD The hosts for this year are country music star Luke Bryan and retired football quarterback Peyton Manning both from the south and country music enthusiasts PERIOD

With  awards to give and dozens of nominees vying for a prize it can be hard to know where each award will go so back page editor and country music enthusiast Kayla Ross is here to break down the major categories and provide expert predictions on who will take home a win PERIOD

Entertainer of the Year

Luke Combs is anticipated to win this one PERIOD His current tour has been sold out everywhere and fans rave about the energy and kindness exuded at his concerts PERIOD Luke Combs is surely a fan favorite and is described as electric by fans who have seen him live PERIOD

Female Vocalist of the Year

The nominees for Female Vocalist of the Year are Miranda Lambert Ashley McBryde Carly Pearce Carrie Underwood and Lainey Wilson PERIOD Carly Pearce is thought to have a good chance at this one as her album  was very successful PERIOD Pearce is a fresher face than Lambert or Underwood and is debatably more popular than McBryde or Wilson PERIOD

Male Vocalist of the Year

Morgan Wallen will likely take the award for this category PERIOD After his recently released singles such as Flower Shops with Ernest and You Proof Wallen has certainly proved his vocal abilities and popularity even after public controversies over Wallen using racial slurs PERIOD

Vocal Group of the Year

The nominees for Vocal Group of the Year are Lady A Little Big Town Midland Old Dominion and Zac Brown Band PERIOD This award will likely go to Zac Brown Band considering they have the most recent release of music with the wellreceived  release of their album The Comeback PERIOD

Vocal Duo of the Year

The winning duo will likely be either Dan  Shay or Maddie  Tae as they have been heavily rotated on country radio within the last year PERIOD Brothers Osborne and Brooks  Dunn have both been around for quite some time leading some to believe this award will not go to either of these duos PERIOD

New Artist of the Year

Nominated for New Artist of the Year are HARDY Walker Hayes Cody Johnson Parker McCollum and Lainey Wilson PERIOD Lainey Wilsons music is critically acclaimed especially after touring with Morgan Wallen so this award is expected to go to her PERIOD

Album of the Year

Miranda Lambert has been nominated for this award five times and won it twice PERIOD Lambert will potentially win this award for the third time in her music career with Palomino PERIOD

Song of the Year

Notably nominated for song of the year You Should Probably Leave is the second released single off of Stapletons album Starting Over PERIOD This sultry song did well on country radio and is one of Stapletons top five streamed songs on Spotify so it may take home the win for the night PERIOD

Musical Event of the Year

Never Wanted To Be That Girl is a popular song and has been repeatedly compared to Does He Love You by Reba McEntire and Linda Davis PERIOD Never Wanted To Be That Girl praised as a powerful timeless female duet is a favorite to win PERIOD

Music Video of the Year

Nominated for Best Music Video of the Year is I Bet You Think About Me Taylors Version From The Vault by Taylor Swift ft PERIOD Chris Stapleton PERIOD There are four other nominees but seeing as this is Swifts first CMA nomination since  this music video is projected to win PERIOD This video was praised for Blake Livelys artful directions and lavish scenes of Taylor Swift in a red ball gown as she traipses around an exs wedding PERIOD

The winners of the  CMA Awards will be revealed at the awards ceremony on November  airing at  p.m PERIOD EST on ABC PERIOD
