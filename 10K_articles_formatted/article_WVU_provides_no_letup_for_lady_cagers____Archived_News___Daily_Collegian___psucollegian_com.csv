WVU provides no letup for lady cagers

From the frying pan into the fire PERIOD

The No PERIOD  womens basketball team   in the Atlantic  won a big game when it beat Tennessee  last Sunday at Rec Hall PERIOD Now the Lady Lions must play an even more important game when they face Atlantic  rival West Virginia at  p.m PERIOD tomorrow at Rec Hall PERIOD

While Tennessee was a name school that Penn State was never able to beat until last Sunday West Virginia is  against the Lady Lions PERIOD West Virginia has been improving right along with Penn State and should pose quite a challenge to the Lady Lions record 14game winning streak at Rec Hall PERIOD

 Penn State Head Coach Rene Portland said PERIOD 

The Lady Mountaineers   in the Atlantic  are not ranked but they arent much below that level PERIOD Three of their losses were at Tennessee by two at No PERIOD  Kentucky by seven and at No PERIOD  Mississippi by  PERIOD Penn State Head Coach Rene Portland hopes that West Virginia will lose to No PERIOD  also PERIOD

 Portland said PERIOD 

This particular game certainly would be a good one to think about PERIOD West Virginia is one of the top rebounding teams in the country and that is Penn States biggest weakness PERIOD And the Lady Mountaineers have good outside shooters to complement that inside presence PERIOD

 Portland said PERIOD 

This past week the Penn State bench has been somewhat depleted because of the physical Tennessee game and a virus that is making the rounds PERIOD Even worse news for Portland is that junior shooting guard Joanie OBrien reinjured her right knee in practice Wednesday PERIOD OBrien seemed to have finally completely recovered from a stretched ligament in the knee when she scored  points against Tennessee but now she seems certain to miss at least the West Virginia game and perhaps also the Pittsburgh game on Monday PERIOD

Junior  Lorraine McGirt is one Lady Lion who has avoided the flu PERIOD She has played West Virginia many times before but this is the first time she has faced the Lady Mountaineers since moving to small forward PERIOD

 McGirt said 

Thats good because the fireis worse than the frying pan PERIOD
