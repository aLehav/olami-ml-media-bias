4133,2013-01-18,"a worldview is effectively a set of beliefs and assumptions through which someone interprets the world around them PERIOD Whether or not a philosophy qualifies as a worldview is really a matter of how pervasive that ideology is to them PERIOD Since its a leap from the mainstream to call yourself an atheist crossing that threshold means that its probably a lens that you lay over other things too PERIOD

In a denotative sense atheism is a direct refutation of faith in all its fashions but doesnt that just sound shitty We all take it our own way to whatever extent we like yet there are inherent qualities to atheism that generalize it enough to be considered a worldview PERIOD

For example the atheist and scientific communities are so intertwined that belief in evolution can be considered one of our defaults too PERIOD Religious worldviews tend to resist evolution because it diminishes the special place humanity has on the world stage but talk about being wrong for the right reasons Once you ditch the idea of humanity as a theistic trustfund baby were actually a pretty cool ragstorichestoworldsupremacy narrative PERIOD Its hard to imagine a species with limited sensory function and almost no defense mechanisms thriving but weve really made the best out of a couple of thumbs and a bit of teamwork PERIOD

Overall atheisms lack of formal organization conceals how positively we view the world PERIOD The most famous atheists often reach that level through highlyexposed confrontations with other groups but that is one thing that maintains them as peers in lieu of leaders PERIOD The media exposure they get sometimes leads to misunderstandings of our demeanor as people but atheism wouldnt be a worthy way of life with party politics involved PERIOD Thats why people ask us whether or not wed vote for an openly atheist presidential candidate and we say No because that doesnt make them good at everything else. atheism as a worldview presents a paradox PERIOD On the one hand identifying with the idea has definite influence on the way one perceives the world around them PERIOD However free thought is so imperative to who and what we are that its difficult to generalize exactly what that means PERIOD It means different things to different people but its definitely an important part of those lives PERIOD

When one claims that heshe is an atheist a whole barrage of luggage comes with that label one which can either be positive or negative depending on your point of view PERIOD To some it means an unreasonably angry person who has nothing better to do than stand around and hate God PERIOD To another it might mean someone who is intelligent sensible and good at debating PERIOD And still to others it could simply mean the person sitting next to you on the morning bus PERIOD

Atheism at its core only means one thing the lack of belief in a God PERIOD A means without and theism has to do with God or gods. that is atheism in a nutshell PERIOD A few religions like Buddhism and Jainism actually do not advocate a belief in a god PERIOD Thus as contradicting as it may seem it allows an atheist to actually be religious in this sense PERIOD Of course some problems might arise with being spiritual and at the same time not believing in a god but there is no direct contradiction PERIOD

However this is not the concept of an atheist that many hold PERIOD Atheism seems to have evolved to imply many other things like an appreciation of science a sense of skepticism toward claims that arent supported by evidence and a criticism of religious institutions PERIOD Of course these arent requirements for one to become an atheist PERIOD Unlike many religious or political movements there isnt any ceremony no fees to pay and no test to take to become a cardcarrying atheist. despite many peoples misconceptions we dont gather in dark robes and sacrifice goats to initiate a new member PERIOD Simply ask yourself Do I believe in a god If your answer is no bingo You may now call yourself an atheist Ill go get the goats PERIOD

So is atheism a worldview I believe it is more of a product of another worldview a constant asking of why and a requirement for evidence PERIOD Of course it doesnt have to be but more often than not you will probably find that atheists have a wellthoughtout supported case regarding why they hold certain beliefs and disbeliefs PERIOD Being at one time a believer in God I can say that atheism has definitely changed my view of the world and for the better PERIOD

Absolutely not PERIOD Atheism is absolutely not a worldview PERIOD The lack of belief in deities does not equate to any ideology or worldview PERIOD

No PERIOD Just like off isnt a TV channel atheism isnt a world view PERIOD

Secular humanism naturalism scienceism I made that one up physicalism nihilism etc  those can be world views that are often overlapping with atheism

But no  atheism by itself is not a world view PERIOD

Sounds pretty similar to scientism PERIOD

Atheism isnt a world view no PERIOD Nor is there any real uniformity in atheist beliefs PERIOD The only thing that all atheists have in common is a rejection of God claims PERIOD While it is true that many atheists reject other supernatural claims for the same reason they reject claims of God this is not a universal rule PERIOD

Many world view incorporate atheism in their make up but atheism on its own is not world view PERIOD It has no doctrines no requirements no structure of any kind that would make it one PERIOD It is simply a lack of belief in Gods PERIOD

Atheism no but mydis belief in Bigfoot is a world view PERIOD

Rationalism is the worldview most commonly associated with atheism today PERIOD Sadly this can be pretty crude and usually involves rejecting not just religion but all mythologies and works of the imagination as unreal. realityunreality here is supposedly based on sense experience but lacks the radical subjectivity and nuance of empiricism PERIOD

Not all atheists fit this stereotype the great Scottish philosopher and atheist Hume was an empiricist as was Einstein PERIOD

Atheism constitutes a worldview to the exactly the same degree that not collecting stamps constitutes a hobby PERIOD

To be a theist or to hold any belief whatsoever you are asserting a proposal PERIOD
The prefix A simply means without. calling yourself an atheist indicates that you abstain from the proposals of theism or any assertion thereof PERIOD
That is the full and complete implication of the word atheism. it offers no counter proposals or world views or any view at all PERIOD  The word atheism wouldnt exist had the word theism never been invented PERIOD

Each persons worldview is made up of all of the beliefs that person has PERIOD One belief alone is only part of a persons world view PERIOD My belief in the validity of the Bible is part of my world view PERIOD Someones atheism is part of their world view PERIOD Two different Christians may have very different world views PERIOD Two different atheists may have very different world views PERIOD In each case the pair of persons would have at least one thing in common in their world views PERIOD One can speak of the Christian world view but even there you could find different ChristiansRead more 

False again.Atheism is not a worldview.it is simply an answer to one question.do you believe in a god or gods.if the answer is noyour an atheist

this has nothing to do with any other questionswhether you believe in a afterlife ghosts fairies evolution or so on

To Andy may I say that perhaps that might work if you were to replace atheism with agnosticism PERIOD  Atheism clearly is a proposal PERIOD  It says There is no God. it is a very well defined belief PERIOD
Agnosticism says I dont know if there is a God or perhaps better put We cannot know if there is a God. though the second is more of a proposal than the first PERIOD

Incorrect  Atheism doesnt say there is no god Atheism is the lack of belief in godsthat is I dont believe

This is not a absolute positionMost atheists are agnostic commonly referred to as agnostic atheists 

that is we dont know there is a godthere might besurehowever I dont believe there is because there isnt sufficient evidence to make this claim plausible enough to believe

simple

well I believe in God because the alternative is even less believeable PERIOD Consider that both Christianity and secular naturalism believe that the universe began in a state of chaos PERIOD Christianity teaches that the universe as we know it was formed by a thinking supreme being who made choices and formed the universe into the reality that is around us today PERIOD Naturalism teaches that the universe as it is came from that chaos by chance PERIOD Oh I know there was some kind of determinism at work there natural laws that caused galaxies and solar systems to form planets to form someRead more 

Sloppy PERIOD The universe does not require an alpha male to govern itself PERIOD Inventing one to cover your human idea of chaos and order is merely more projections PERIOD So is seeing the universe in terms of chaos and order btw PERIOD

Atheism is the refutation of the belief in god due to the lack of empirical evidence PERIOD

It is not shitty PERIOD

I also refute the value of Taylor Swift though there is evidence of her existence PERIOD Is that shitty too

I really like this format bit in this case the question is just one of definition and by any inclusive definition atheism includes any person who doesnt hold a belief in any deity PERIOD I have seen other definitions used especially in earlier days when theism was legally required but today enough people who selfidentify as atheists claim only a lack of belief in any deity for any other definition to be unreasonable PERIOD I have met atheists who believe a bunch of nonsense like conspiracy theories and that basically all science since Faraday is wrong PERIOD I know some atheists who areRead more
