We are a medium of communication Sowa said PERIOD

Corporate video use depends on experience and perceptions of how it used he said PERIOD It is at a critical turning point with the blooming of technology Sowa said PERIOD

Corporate video has become so successful because it meets different needs for different types of content and may facilitate communication in a variety of mediums PERIOD

Intentions and motivations guide content selection and use patterns he said PERIOD

Success also depends on actual integration into organizational routines PERIOD

Individuals may use media for a number of reasons Sowa said PERIOD

Sowa emphasized that people use corporate video since because society is so fascinated with television media and the need for organizational communication PERIOD

It may be very accessible to your desktop computer in the near future with improved bandwidth and increased affordability Sowa said PERIOD We live in an increasingly visual culture with videos and the Internet. email may contribute to performance but may also detract performance as well he said PERIOD

Sowa also stated that communication and increased dialogue among users is helpful PERIOD

The blooming of technology may lead to higher levels of task orientation in the workplace he said PERIOD

While corporate video use may be influenced by communication norms accessibility is still an issue PERIOD

It isnt taken seriously by many employees Sowa said PERIOD Positive orientation of this material is helpful. sowas research concluded employees often perceive higher levels of entertainment material PERIOD However designing desirable programming and the variety of programming that workers want is still limited PERIOD

This is only the beginning and we have a long way to go Sowa said PERIOD The uses and gratifications of corporate video is still very complex and there are many variations. he recommended that a largescale study across several organizations will provide a clearer picture of communication PERIOD

Students will see more of this type of content in the marketplace in the twenty-first century Sowa said PERIOD
