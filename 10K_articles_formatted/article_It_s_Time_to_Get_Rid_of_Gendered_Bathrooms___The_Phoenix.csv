8917,2019-09-12,"i am a cis woman so I have never had to give much thought to my choice of bathroom PERIOD In fact it wasnt until I got to Swarthmore three years ago that I even encountered the idea of genderinclusive restrooms which are bathrooms that are not separated by gender PERIOD

My first year hall in Wharton originally had gendered bathrooms and then transitioned to genderinclusive PERIOD When my thenRA asked the residents what we preferred I distinctly remember looking at him and shrugging as if to say Whats the difference really Looking back I see the privilege I had in giving that answer because I had never before had to think about my bathroom choice PERIOD Today I am a firm believer in the idea that we have to do away with gendered bathrooms and switch them all out for genderinclusive ones PERIOD

Gendered bathrooms provide a difficulty for nonbinary and trans individuals PERIOD Whether its because they feel compelled to use a bathroom others might expect them to use or because they pick a bathroom they might be able to blend into more it forces individuals to make a decision they might not feel completely comfortable with PERIOD On top of that it may force people to choose a bathroom that does not align with their identity and after making a decision they can still face discrimination for their careful choice PERIOD While trans and nonbinary individuals may identify in a certain way in their daily life they might feel the expectations of those around them force their hand when it comes to choosing a bathroom PERIOD Sometimes if an individual wants a genderinclusive bathroom they may be forced to go very far out of their way in order to find it thereby cutting into the time they might have to do other things PERIOD

Gender neutral bathrooms give more individuals a chance to feel comfortable when using bathrooms and stop imposing gendered and superficial expectations of what a certain gender might look like PERIOD Neutralizing bathrooms would allow for a safer experience for trans and nonbinary people when using bathrooms and ultimately allow for more equality within our society PERIOD Bathrooms should also be gender neutral because femaleidentifying people should not be forced to wait for an absurd amount of time to use the bathroom while the maleidentifying people are in and out in five minutes tops PERIOD Just because I and many others identify as women does not mean that we should be forced to waste hours over the course of our lifetimes waiting for access to a toilet PERIOD

One night this summer when I was leaving a concert with my family all four of us decided to run to the bathroom before heading home PERIOD My family consists of three women and a man and we split off accordingly PERIOD While the female lane snaked out into the hallway the male line was about three people long PERIOD By the time my dad was finished my mom sister and I had moved up about a foot in line PERIOD By the time I was actually able to get to a stall at least fifteen minutes had passed and in that time my dad had managed to do about two full laps of the stadium floor we were on PERIOD This was immensely frustrating not only because it was late at night but also because I was wasting my time in a line that maleidentifying people were able to completely evade PERIOD

A study at Ghent University found that male bathrooms tend to have more toilet options and that men generally take less time to use the bathroom PERIOD Due to this male lines are much shorter than female lines PERIOD And over the course of a lifetime those precious minutes add up for female identifying people PERIOD Interestingly the study then tried to come up with a solution for this disparity and found that the most sensible solution was implementing gender neutral bathrooms PERIOD Although men would still have an advantage in unisex bathrooms due to urinals the average wait time would decrease by  percent PERIOD

While this study has clearly illustrated that gender neutral bathrooms would drastically reduce the disparity in wait time between sexed bathrooms it still advantages men PERIOD In order to create a more fair and balanced society we have to remove gendered bathrooms completely and make every bathroom genderinclusive PERIOD This is the only way we can increase inclusivity while also creating a more equitable society across the board PERIOD Not only would neutralizing bathrooms even out time spent waiting on bathroom lines but it would also allow for trans and nonbinary individuals to feel more at ease when choosing which bathroom to use PERIOD It would actively create a society that is more fair and just for all people no matter how they identify in terms of their gender PERIOD

My journey through Swarthmore has certainly taught me that if one of us is suffering in any way then we are all as a community suffering PERIOD The oppression of one person deeply impacts us all and its important that we move forward as a community to ease such systematic oppression PERIOD If we are to work and live as a community when one person is harmed in any way we are all harmed and impacted by that pain PERIOD We cannot hope to move forward and achieve the peak happiness and success within our community if individuals within that community are harmed PERIOD And gendered bathrooms are one of the most blatant ways we as individuals in the same community are oppressed PERIOD

Bathrooms today are sexist and oppressive and in order to have real equality across the board we cannot keep our bathrooms gendered PERIOD Not only that but they also create an exclusive and often uncomfortable space for transgender and nonbinary people when trying to use a bathroom PERIOD Creating a world that is accessible and welcoming to all people includes changing habits weve built up over the course of our whole lives and it definitely means we need to start replacing gendered bathrooms to genderinclusive bathrooms PERIOD As a femaleidentifying person I refuse to waste more time than necessary in order to use the bathroom while maleidentifying people are able to use the bathroom quickly PERIOD And as a human being I refuse to keep living quietly in a society that is actively ignoring the changes we should be making in order to let all people be more comfortable in bathrooms PERIOD Genderexclusive bathrooms have created an uncertain uncomfortable and often unsafe space for trans and nonbinary people and they thrust an unnecessary burden upon them to change the conversation PERIOD Right now bathrooms are just another exclusive space for people who are privileged enough to be comfortable with the gender the door shows them yet for some reason they arent an area where we are willing to make real changes PERIOD Its time to take down gendered bathrooms  if not for common human decency then for the fact that we should all have to wait the same amount of time to reach a toilet PERIOD
