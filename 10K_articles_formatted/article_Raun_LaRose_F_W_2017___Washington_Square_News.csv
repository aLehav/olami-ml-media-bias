PVC neoprene vinyl and lam gave new structure and feel to familiar silhouettes PERIOD Wide leg pants held their columnar shape rather than flowing PERIOD Turtle necks stood tall PERIOD Coats kept to clean lines PERIOD

The strongest looks were monochromatic  black navy or white PERIOD Each singletoned ensemble was comprised of various finishes like PVC details invisible mesh and laminated garments that highlighted points of interest PERIOD

The combination of matte and sheen throughout gave even more dimension to the structural collection PERIOD Volumeplay in the shape of quilted bubble coats also added variety in silhouette PERIOD

While most of the collection had a modern aesthetic a few looks went on a more traditional approach for fall incorporating brown tweed PERIOD
