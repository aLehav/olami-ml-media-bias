Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD was an inspirational man who stood up to decades of bigotry for the civil rights movement PERIOD People across the country joined him in that spirited movement for racial equality PERIOD They followed him respected him and made him a leader because he promoted progressive democratic ideals PERIOD He succeeded because he didnt just fight for a few policies  he stood and died for an issue bigger than himself.That same support should be brewing right now PERIOD The two Democratic frontrunners are making history because neither of them is a white man.Once again there is a bigger issue at stake than Americans are conscious of PERIOD We the voters have the power to vote a woman into the White House ultimately shattering the heritable glass ceiling that has encaged women throughout U.S PERIOD history.Womens hardships in the workplace are too often overlooked by male ignorance PERIOD Whether men understand the imbalance of treatment  its there PERIOD Women on average receive around  cents for every dollar a man makes are less likely to attain a job promotion and more likely to be harassed PERIOD Sexual harassment in the workplace wasnt even recognized by law until the mid 70s.The more a woman tries to climb the corporate ladder the more wounds she obtains from bumping her head on the glass ceiling PERIOD There cant be progress in womens rights unless a different step is taken to produce a dramatic change.Presidency is that necessary transcendent step PERIOD What greater milestone could there be for an American woman to overcomeMultiple campaigns have said that Americans should vote a particular candidate into office because hell implement change PERIOD The truth is that we have the chance to make a historic change simply by voting for a woman president.Hillary Clintons presidency would improve social standing workplace opportunity confidence and selfrespect among American women.If Clinton is elected president it wouldnt only be a triumph for her  it would be a triumph for all American women.Its shameful that it took women so long for one to get this far in her political career PERIOD Its been almost  years since the nineteenth Amendment was ratified and only a handful of women have been influential enough to gain sufficient publicity to throw their hat in the ring PERIOD But all their stories have the same unsuccessful ending.I will never forget how I cried tears of happiness last year when Nancy Pelosi became the first woman speaker of the House PERIOD I finally felt progress PERIOD I finally felt an encouraging change in direction PERIOD A woman is third in line in the U.S PERIOD government PERIOD So close yet still so far.My fellow ladies isnt it inspirational to know you could look back on this election and know that you voted for the first U.S PERIOD woman president Even the realization that there could be a First Gentleman should make you smile.Knowing a female presidential candidate is as close as Clinton  this is how it feels for a country to obtain progress PERIOD This is what happens when all Americans become equal PERIOD And every woman should be passionate about escalating womens rights.Feminism comes in many forms and so does activism PERIOD To show support for progression you dont need to join a feminist organization you dont need to hold up signs you dont need to subscribe to feminist newsletters  all you need to do is vote for the only woman who has a chance PERIOD She has an outstanding chance.All women should demand equality in their lifetime and for the women who follow PERIOD To obtain change we must act and elect Clinton as our next president.We climbed our way up and now we must vote for the candidate who has the tools to break the glass ceiling PERIOD
