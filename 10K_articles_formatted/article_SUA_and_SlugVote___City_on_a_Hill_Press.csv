969,2012-04-29,"uC Santa Cruz is No PERIOD  in voter registration at  percent falling right behind UC Santa Barbara at  percent said Student Union Assembly SUA vote coordinator Barry Jakob PERIOD

Jakob wants to change that with a new SUA initiative SlugVOTE PERIOD

Ideally Id like to see the numbers go up to  or  percent of the student body Jakob said PERIOD I want us to be number one in the UC system. slugVOTE is a planned SUA voter registration initiative conducted by Jakob and several other students PERIOD The goals of SlugVOTE Jakob said include being a constant presence on campus PERIOD

SlugVOTE is an organization that acts all year every year he said PERIOD Its not just an implied power that only acts a month in advance of election season. slugVOTE isnt like CalPIRG or other Quarry Plaza staples Jakob said but there will be a Quarry Plaza presence PERIOD

We want to outreach in a way thats different from the way voter registration has been done here before Jakob said PERIOD We want people to come to us PERIOD Well have a table with a fivegallon water cooler candy things like that. jakob and SUA communications director Shaz Umer said the central hope behind SlugVOTE is that it will outlast the presence of its current coordinators PERIOD Plans are underway for the initiative to be institutionalized within the infrastructure of SUA PERIOD

Its also being incorporated in the position of SUA external vice chancellor currently held by Nelson Cortez PERIOD SlugVote will be one of the responsibilities of the office of the EVC Umer said PERIOD

Most students are probably familiar with the packets received on movein day complete with a voter registration form PERIOD Jakob thinks that method is too passive and intends to go door to door among the dorms knocking and asking people to register to vote PERIOD

Campus movein day is going to look a lot different PERIOD Youll see a voter registration presence there Jakob said PERIOD We want it become a cultural core feature of UCSC civic engagement PERIOD We want it to last for future generations. umer and Jakob also hope the initiative can be interwoven with other campus events PERIOD

We would like to make SlugVOTE services available to all student organizations on campus and we would like to be able to table at those events Jakob said PERIOD
