At the end of the firstfloor hallway on the right side in the theatre arts wing of the Doudna Fine Arts Center there is a room filled with clothes costumes and props PERIOD



The people who work in this room make alternate and create the costumes and some of the props seen on stage through the different productions over the semester PERIOD

The costume shop is a series of room filled with costumes fabrics boxes of pins and threads PERIOD

The director of the Costume Shop is Karen Eisenhour a theatre arts professor PERIOD

She said her and the students who work in the shop build costumes from scratch reuse previous costumes or make alterations PERIOD

Eisenhour said the process of creating the costumes starts with the scripts for the production PERIOD

She said she will read it and take notes about the time place and characteristic of the characters PERIOD

My basic checklist is what do they say about themselves what do others say about them and get a really good sense of who they are as individuals Eisenhour said PERIOD

She said after the notes the design team meets to build the wardrobe PERIOD

Eisenhour does not do the designs herself because the costumes would come out differently PERIOD

We have to create an unified world on stage so that itll be believable to the audience Eisenhour said PERIOD If I went and did something one way and the other designers went another way it wouldnt look like a unit. the team develops a concept and then starts the process of making the costumes for the show PERIOD

They will see what they have in the vault that they use and make what other costumes they need PERIOD

Grace Munoz a sophomore theatre arts major said she likes seeing the work she did and see it on stage in the show PERIOD

I like to create things especially things Ill get to see later Munoz said PERIOD I like how we get to take nothing most of the time and create a whole new costume for a specific character. eisenhour said they are currently making costumes for the performance of A Christmas Carol. there are  people in there and each of them has at least one costume she said PERIOD So when you start adding up numbers it starts to be a lot. on top of creating the basic costumes for the productions the people in the shop try to build in little surprises for the audience to enjoy PERIOD

Our Christmas future is going to have a really nice surprise to him so people will have to come and see Eisenhour said PERIOD

Gianni Adorno a senior theatre arts major said he can express his creativity in the shop PERIOD

Its my passion its something that Im good at and Im not limited with my creativity when I work here Adorno said PERIOD It keeps me busy and keeps me the hard working person that I am. eisenhour said the Costume Shop is not just a place where they build the costumes audience see on stage PERIOD

She said there are a lot of different types of students in the shop some who have sewn for a while and other who have never done it before PERIOD

Its not just working the shop to build the show though we have to have the done its also how can we teach as we go Eisenhour said PERIOD

Sophia Welsh a sophomore communication disorders and sciences major said she like the shop because she is not a theatre major PERIOD

I get to see the behind the scenes of all the plays before they come out and even though I work here its still a learning experience Welsh said PERIOD

Eisenhour said she is a teacher a designer and a seamstress PERIOD

Its a revolving door and I wear many hats at once Eisenhour said PERIOD Sometimes my worlds stay very separate and sometimes they create an interesting colleague of who I am all at once. she said the shop does not often get recognized but that is OK PERIOD

She added that the costumes are supposed to help transform the characters and give an element to the show not take it over PERIOD

If I do my job correctly the audience doesnt know Ive done my job Eisenhour said PERIOD Often times if you are excluded from a review though it is nice to be acknowledged and mentions it means youve done your job well because you havent done anything to take over the show. welsh said she has made so many friends in the shop PERIOD

Everyone is super friendly here its a little family Welsh said PERIOD

Eisenhour said the shop is there for anyone PERIOD

This is our world Eisenhour said PERIOD
