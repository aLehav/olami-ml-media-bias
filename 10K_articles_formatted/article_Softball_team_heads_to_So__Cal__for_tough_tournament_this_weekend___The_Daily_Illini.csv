2344,2023-10-26,"while most Illinois students will be bundled up this weekend the softball team wont be PERIOD

For the third straight weekend the Illini will play in a road tournament this time in the Mary Nutter Colegiate Classic in Palm Springs Calif PERIOD Theyll face four teams that have all been ranked at some point in the season PERIOD

Its exciting to go to all these different parts of the country senior pitcher Pepper Gay said PERIOD Not many people can say they do that so we take full advantage of the opportunities we have and we love playing on the road. illinois schedule for the weekend is by no means a breeze PERIOD The Illini will play No PERIOD  Washington and Oregon State on Friday before facing No PERIOD  California on Saturday and Georgia Tech on Sunday PERIOD

Everyone knows our philosophy we play the best and were not looking for any cupcake schedule head coach Terri Sullivan said PERIOD Our young players we say we throw them right to the fire its great competition quality competition  and each weekend weve opened up against a topfive team and have had an opportunity to do something special PERIOD Every time theres a challenge theres an opportunity and this weekend we want to grab some of those opportunities. the team will play three night games in as many days which Sullivan says has the Illini excited PERIOD

All players love night games Sullivan said PERIOD Pitchers feel like they throw a little bit harder and its fun playing under the lights but the bottom line is winners win PERIOD They win when they play at  in the morning which we do and they win when they play at  at night which we do they win in rain sleet sun whatever matters winners win. the Illini were up and down in their last tournament finishing the weekend  with wins against instate rival DePaul and Houston and two losses to No PERIOD  Texas PERIOD

I really like how we responded toward the end of the weekend PERIOD At this level you have to be able to give punches and take punches and I thought we did that especially in the final game on Sunday PERIOD We were really tested last weekend and we came up short a couple times and now we just need to close things out and really get that consistency going in the third tournament of the year which will be a huge challenge with tremendous competition. to be more consistent Illinois has been taking as many reps as possible in its practices this week PERIOD

Its really a coach cliche to say but the way you play has a lot to do with the way you practice Sullivan said PERIOD We want quality reps and at this level  taking care of the ball is so big PERIOD We always say playing a high level of catch is the foundation of a good defense and some drops or poor throws have put our back against the wall a couple times this season and against the competition PERIOD We play if we give them too many opportunities to have second chances that can hurt you PERIOD Again its practicing hard and focusing and playing in the moment and the simple fundamentals of softball. the Illini continue to finetune all aspects of the game to improve every week PERIOD

We want to make those routine plays Sullivan said PERIOD Throw the ball catch the ball we want our pitchers to throw strikes PERIOD When they throw strikes the best of the best arent hitting them and we want to execute our offensive game plan. illinois has also been trying to jell as a team PERIOD

Were really just working on coming together sophomore Jess Perkins said PERIOD Finding our chemistry and going out strong PERIOD We have to trust each other know that we all have each others backs and if we do that well win this weekend. nicholas can be reached at emailprotected and IlliniSportsGuy PERIOD",Softball team heads to So.
