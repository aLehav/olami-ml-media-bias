Benjamin Padanilam  Wednesday May  

Playing in its secondtolast midweek game of the season Notre Dame hit four home runs and scored  runs against Western Michigan to cruise to a  win Tuesday night at Frank Eck Stadium PERIOD

The Irish   ACC jumped out to an early lead in the bottom of the first inning when junior second baseman Nick Podkul and junior center fielder Matt Vierling hit backtoback home runs with two outs to give the Irish a quick  lead over the Broncos1819  MAC PERIOD That lead was quickly extended in the bottom of the second inning when freshman third baseman Niko Kavadas led off the inning with a solo shot of his own to put Notre Dame up  PERIOD And although the Irish would go scoreless in the third inning and the Broncos would add a run of their own in the top of the fourth the Irish benefitted from yet another home run in the bottom of the fourth when junior right fielder Eric Gilgenbach followed up a Kavadas single with a tworun shot to left field to put Notre Dame up  PERIOD

Irish head coach Mik Aoki said the early power display provided a muchneeded boost for the team in the game as the Irish took advantage of a wind blowing out to left field and gave themselves a cushion they would not relinquish in the game PERIOD

It was good PERIOD Obviously the conditions were conducive to it with the wind blowing out some  but it was good Aoki said PERIOD Its always good to score first  kind of loosens it up a little bit lets us play from in front a little bit PERIOD Im not sure that theres a sport in existence that its not better to be playing from in front than behind. and the Irish would continue to extend the gap by which they were out front scoring two runs in the sixth inning four runs in the seventh and three more runs in the eighth to round out its 14run outing PERIOD The Irish scored those runs on  hits  with Podkul Vierling and Kavadas each notching at least two knocks  and a patient approach at the plate that netted eight walks drawn by Irish hitters PERIOD

But the performances on the mound were nearly as strong as the ones at the plate PERIOD Freshman southpaw Tommy Sheehan started the game for the Irish and threw four innings in which he allowed just four hits and one run  the result of backtoback twoout doubles by the Broncos in the top of the fourth inning  with two strikeouts in  pitches PERIOD

That might have been one of Tommys better performances Aoki said PERIOD I thought he was in the strike zone PERIOD He had the one atbat against Broncos freshman right fielder Blake Dunn that went  or  pitches  counts on probably three or four of those  I think earlier in the year he loses that guy and he made him put it in play and recorded the out PERIOD I thought that was really good PERIOD I thought the compete factor there was much better than we had seen earlier in the year PERIOD

Then sophomore righthander Zack Martin came in for four innings of relief and picked up the win allowing four hits and no runs on an efficient  pitches PERIOD

Zack for me kind of got back to who Zack is  kind of in the strike zone and making people beat him Aoki said PERIOD The past couple of outings with Boston College and Virginia Tech the weekend before some of the innings that got to him where theres a walk and a hit batter or something like that  thats to me really not who and what Zack is as a pitcher PERIOD So I think seeing him get back to who he was was good to see. the Broncos would score three of their four runs in the top of the ninth off of Irish sophomore righthander Anthony Holubecki but that proved to be far too little far too late to get them back in the contest as Notre Dame eventually recorded the final out for the  win PERIOD

The efficiency with which Sheehan and Martin made their way through eight innings was especially important for Aoki as he said he plans to have the two in the fold for Sundays game against Pittsburgh as the Irish will prepare for their final home series of the season starting Friday and lasting through Sunday PERIOD Looking to keep the momentum going with just seven games left on the schedule Aoki said pitching will be a major factor this weekend against the Panthers   ACC with graduate student southpaw Scott Tully set to lead things off Friday when Notre Dame and Pittsburgh square off for the first game of the weekend at  p.m PERIOD

Hopefully Tully can create some momentum for us off the mound Friday Aoki said PERIOD When we go in there  obviously with seven games left all of the games are really important to put us in a position to accomplish some of the things that we wanted to at the outset of the season PERIOD So Tuesday night was step one and hopefully we can continue to play going in through the weekend and come out with some good results against Pittsburgh. share This Story
