Virginia Tech mens soccer fell to No PERIOD  North Carolina Wednesday night in the first round of the ACC tournament  a loss that puts the nail in the coffin on the Hokies season PERIOD

While most of spooky seasons special events have come to pass fall is far from over with plenty of fun festivities still in store for Hokies hoping to embrace all the season has to offer PERIOD Southwest Virginia hosts events and has natural beauty for students to enjoy with family friends or 

An open letter to President Sands

Search salaries of employees from Virginia Tech and other universities dating back to  PERIOD

It is assured that former New Mexico Gov PERIOD Gary Johnson will not win this years presidential election but the Libertarians of the United States have a new goal to receive campaign funding for  PERIOD

Many conservatives see Johnson and Libertarians as just another spoiler ignoring the fact they display their own ideology as well PERIOD The Libertarians goal is to become a prominent third political party in the United States and a viable alternative to the twoparty system this country has employed since its beginning PERIOD

I have found myself resenting both President Barack Obama and Gov PERIOD Mitt Romney during this election PERIOD However one of these men is going to be our next CommanderinChief PERIOD

I know there are many people who do not feel either of these candidates would help the country progress PERIOD Sadly the twoparty system has made people resort to holding their noses at the polls and voting for a candidate that does not fit their views PERIOD

Over the years we have been tricked into believing that if we vote for a thirdparty candidate our vote does not matter PERIOD I am here to say every vote matters no matter what candidate you vote for on Election Day PERIOD

The main point of a democracy is that everyone has a say PERIOD That means if you want to vote for Virgil Goode the Constitution Party candidate or Rocky Anderson the Justice Party candidate then you have every right to do so PERIOD Do not submit to the people who state you are wasting your vote PERIOD

In this election I will be voting for Johnson because under most issues I lean libertarian PERIOD This is the candidate I want to win the election so I am casting my ballot for him to be elected ignoring the criticism associated with it PERIOD

Even if Johnson does not win the election I still know in my heart I was true to my own ideals and voted for a cause that I believe in PERIOD Of course the Libertarian ideology is not for everyone but it is an alternative to the only two prominently featured in the media PERIOD

Not agreeing with Obama or Romney does not make you foolish ignorant or unintelligent in any sense PERIOD It just means you have a difference in opinion from many other Americans PERIOD This also shows you are attempting to take the next step to change the status quo of the twoparty system PERIOD

For many years third parties have made herculean efforts to turn the corner into national reverence PERIOD Never have they been given the same privileges candidates of the standard two parties enjoy PERIOD However they continue to fight on hoping one day Americans will see there is not just two ways to think about the wellbeing of the nation PERIOD

Tomorrow could be a big step for thirdparties everywhere as both the Libertarian and Green parties have a fighting chance to reach the elusive  percent of the popular vote needed to receive campaign funds from the government in the next election PERIOD If you are still on the fence on whether or not to vote for either Romney or Obama maybe you should question if you should vote for them at all PERIOD
