Updated November     pm

October is Domestic Violence Awareness month and for years UNC Charlotte has played a role in making students aware of the significant impacts of violence PERIOD

The Clothesline Project plus many other events on campus have said it all PERIOD Students should shout out against abuse PERIOD

Recently I had the opportunity to discover a little more than just the basics about relationship violence PERIOD Relationship Violence occurs when one partner uses abusive behavior to assert power and control over the other PERIOD

Violence comes in all forms whether it is verbal emotional or sexual PERIOD

Wednesday Oct PERIOD  UNC Charlotte held an event entitled Are You Seeing Red Green Or Somewhere in Between in the Student Union movie theater PERIOD

Many different organizations on campus involved in relationship violence awareness were in charge of the event PERIOD Jenny Cook health education specialist from the Center for Wellness Promotion ran the entire show in a way that kept the audience engaged PERIOD

Melissa Siegel with the Teen Dating Violence Prevention Speakers Bureau and Princess King assistant director of Minority Student Support Services and the Womens Program of the Dean of Students Office also assisted Cook with the event PERIOD

The organizations involved had put out a table with sunglasses pens flyers purple ribbon pins and plastic cups at the theater entrance PERIOD There were even slap bracelets decorated with the quote I slap my bracelet not my partner. the idea of providing these particular slap bracelets was an effective way to make college students realize that relationship violence is a prevalent matter and that abuse can be seen in many different ways PERIOD

Some of the volunteers were reading the quote giving their thoughts and interpretations of what it meant to them PERIOD

The audience consisted of around  students who participated in the movie night experiment PERIOD

Cook played over  movie clips and music videos PERIOD Jersey Shore The Notebook The O.C. and Greys Anatomy all flashed up on the screen PERIOD Love the Way You Lie by Eminem and We Found Love by Rihanna were two popular music hits shown during the event PERIOD

After each clip was viewed the audience role playing as relationship experts had to put up a red flag if the relationship was seen as unhealthy PERIOD

Contrastingly if the relationship was healthy and cordial students were asked to raise the green flag PERIOD

The students in the audience were told to give their honest feedback about why they chose green red or in between PERIOD The entire experiment was highly interactive as just about everyone had something to say about the clips PERIOD

It was difficult for me to choose which clips from which films to use PERIOD I wanted to make sure I highlighted a variety of different kind of relationships ranging from excessively violent to happy and healthy said Cook PERIOD

Towards the end of the movie night experiment the students had a chance to express their opinions on how the media could have an impact on relationships PERIOD

Many lyrics and images in contemporary music and film can affect interpersonal relationships PERIOD

Often times gender is looked at closely in terms of male versus female there is the debate of whether or not a violent act carries the same meaning when it is committed by a female PERIOD

We have a number of resources on campus and off campus for students to reach out to if need be said Cook PERIOD

Cook emphasized that if anyone knows a friend in an abusive or unhealthy relationship they need to help him or her notify someone expose the violence issue at hand and receive direct assistance PERIOD
