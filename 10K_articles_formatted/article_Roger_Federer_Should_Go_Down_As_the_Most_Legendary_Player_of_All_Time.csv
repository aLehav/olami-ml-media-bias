He might not be the greatest player ever but Roger Federer undoubtedly retired as the most legendary player in tennis PERIOD

In the July  Rolex commercial Numbers Dont Matter the narrator declares whatever the scoreboard says his legend can only grow because in time Roger Federers legacy will prove more perpetual than any number. the ad sparked controversy on Twitter in  as many tennis fans pointed out the arrogant and delusional nature of the eloquently phrased tribute to Rolexs brand ambassador PERIOD After all numbers are the only objective metric to measure success in sports PERIOD However Federer would prefer to ignore that as his two greatest rivals Nadal and Djokovic erase more of his records with each passing year PERIOD

The minutelong montage however never called Federer the greatest player simply arguing that the numbers dont do justice to Federers elegance before during and after his matches PERIOD

To this point there is little dispute among fans players or any observer privileged to have witnessed Federers skill effortless athleticism and tactical brilliance blend together on the court PERIOD There are no words that do justice to Federer in the same sense that a description of a magic trick will never evoke the same feelings of disbelief as an inperson magic performance PERIOD

As David Foster Wallace described in a  New York Times article  perhaps the closest a journalistic piece comes to encapsulating the Swiss Maestro  Federer has shattered every physical limit on his way to becoming an unprecedented superstar PERIOD He so often creates these jawdropping moments by finding the most mindblowing angles never before thought possible PERIOD

Growing up in the Federer era I will never doubt his iconic presence PERIOD As a child just getting into tennis I was enthralled by his aura along with a whole new generation of young tennis players including Carlos Alcaraz who were inspired by a man revolutionizing a game with an extraordinary playing style PERIOD However Roger Federers blistering onehanded backhands and flawless forehand technique were only a fraction of his appeal PERIOD

The 20time Grand Slam champion glided around the court like Michael Jackson moonwalking on a dancefloor and he did so while looking like a royal prince on Wimbledon Centre Court in his golden Nike vest and bandana PERIOD Federer was the epitome of beauty in every aspect PERIOD He could compete for hours and seemingly not break a sweat always appearing poised and unfazed PERIOD

That unparalleled skill helped him amass a record of  during his prime from  record the most consecutive weeks ranked No PERIOD   and reach all four Grand Slam finals in a single season three times in his career PERIOD

But once a match concluded viewers witnessed the real Federer  someone who was down to earth gracious in defeat and victory and courageous enough to display his emotions to the world PERIOD

The only critique one could dare to place on the most beloved man in Switzerland is his inability to win some of the most pivotal matches of his career PERIOD Federer has lost over  matches in which he held a match point including his final doubles match at the Laver Cup Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Most notable of those chokes was the  Wimbledon final against Novak Djokovic PERIOD The fourhour 57minute affair which came down to a fifthset tiebreak after Federer squandered two championship points on his serve was a fairytaleturnednightmare for Federer on Centre Court PERIOD

That year Federer remembered how he held back tears during the trophy ceremony before finally breaking down in the locker room PERIOD We have seen Federer in tears numerous times as he has cried both out of joy and anguish after countless Grand Slam finals PERIOD Federers vulnerability and frequent letdowns remind us of his humanity and in turn paint him as a more embraceable idol PERIOD

For as long as I can remember Federer has been a staple of the tennis world and someone who has helped me grow into a better player and human being PERIOD

Although he is finally hanging up his racket Roger Federers legacy will forever live on PERIOD Tennis fans should remember him as the most legendary player to ever step on the court PERIOD
