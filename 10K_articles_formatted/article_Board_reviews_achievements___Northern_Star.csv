By  Dina PaluzziApril  

While a bill calling for a separate governing board for NIU awaits a hearing in the Illinois Senate a review of the contributions of the Board of Regents NIUs current governing body reveals several accomplishments of the Regents PERIOD

While governed by the Board of Regents NIU has added several schools and programs to make it a good standing university with a reputation for quality PERIOD

Regents Chancellor Roderick Groves said These are programs or actions or efforts that the Board of Regents and the university worked very closely on PERIOD Its not to suggest that this is a oneway street. nIU Illinois State University in Normal and Sangamon State University in Springfield formed the Regency system in  PERIOD

NIU Regency Professor William Monat said that during the period he served as NIU president and Regents chancellor the Regents backed most of NIUs major initiatives PERIOD The Board of Regents was very supportive he said PERIOD

Since  the Regents have been instrumental in or supported many programs and two schools at NIU according to a Regents press release prepared by Cheryl Peck Groves assistant PERIOD The College of Engineering and Engineering Technology and College of Law both were added after NIU became a Regency school PERIOD

The Regents were instrumental in lining up support for the law school and supported all major decisions during the acquisition process according to the release PERIOD The Regents also allotted . million for construction and remodeling of the NIU law school PERIOD

Groves said the Regents led a major legislative campaign and fought some major hurdles in establishing the law school PERIOD Organizing the NIU engineering school also was a difficult difficult undertaking Groves said PERIOD

Monat who was Regents chancellor at the time worked very hard to ensure the engineering schools establishment Groves said PERIOD

NIU Student Regent Nick Valadez said the establishment of the engineering and law schools are not necessarily achievements of the Regents PERIOD Those achievements could have been made by any governing board he said PERIOD

He said however that the Regents have been instrumental in many other issues PERIOD The Regents have been successful in gaining attention of the IBHE and the General Assembly he said PERIOD

Gov PERIOD James Thompsons fiscal year  budget recommendations include  million more funding for the Regency system than it received in FY89 PERIOD Valadez credited a possible funding increase to the efforts of the Regents in securing a percentage increase from the Illinois General Assembly for the Regency schools. regent Brewster Parker said the Regents do a lot for NIU and the other Regency schools PERIOD We do more lobbying than anyone has any knowledge of he said PERIOD

Board members constantly lobby their district legislators to convince them of the need for increased higher education funding Parker said PERIOD Groves and the Regents staff also lobby with the IBHE and state legislators for increased funding for the Regency system he said PERIOD

Now we cant fund the things weve done because of a lack of state funding Parker said PERIOD The NIU law school is financially stable but the engineering school needs more support he said PERIOD

Several doctorate degrees including a doctorate in biology have been added to NIUs curriculum the Regents release states PERIOD The Regents supported the degree even though ISU and three other state schools already offered the degree the release states PERIOD

A cooperative program between NIU and ISU was developed for a doctorate degree in special education PERIOD The Regents persuaded ISU to enter the program even though ISU already had requested the degree PERIOD The Regents also cooperated with the IBHE to receive recognition of an NIU mission in the sciences and establish a geology doctorate PERIOD

As recently as last year the Regents increased faculty salaries to make them equivalent to national salaries PERIOD The . percent increase awarded to NIU faculty was the highest increase in Illinois PERIOD Valadez said the Regents worked hard to get the increases but the argument for faculty salaries speaks for itself. the Regents and their staff also have helped NIU expand academic programming in Rockford and DuPage County PERIOD The Regents have supported this even though funding for the project has been limited PERIOD

Groves said the Regents have gained additional facilities for NIU in a rather imaginative fashion PERIOD This system has been more creative and more energetic in getting additional space than most of the other systems in the state. nIU facilities built or purchased during this period include

the Student Recreation Center

the Art Annex Facility to provide studio space for the College of Visual and Performing Arts

a temporary Engineering Building

the School of Nursing

the Social Science Research Institute in downtown DeKalb

Faraday II a laboratory science building and
