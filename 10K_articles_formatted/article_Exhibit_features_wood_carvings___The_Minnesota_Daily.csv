The man is  years old and he still has an incredibly steady hand for cutting wood blocks she said PERIOD The imagination he uses combines with his flawless technique and I think its the best stuff hes ever done. patty Martinson administrative assistant in the paintings department at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts said these exhibits represent a wonderful change for Larkin PERIOD
The works are just brilliant Martinson said PERIOD They are beautiful and very compelling. the series takes its name from Samuel Butlers novel Erewhon written in  PERIOD Larkin titled each piece in this exhibit after some arbitrary aspect of Butlers work PERIOD
Larkin used a variety of plant and tree forms to represent aspects of the human characters in Butlers novel PERIOD The figures although they are not human form seem to take on human personalities he said PERIOD
In his other series Larkin has retitled and reworked  earlier pieces into an exhibit which is based on William Blakes poem Songs of Innocence and Experience. this exhibit titled The Blade Series is also mostly made up of imaginary plant and tree forms PERIOD Larkin said that he chose Blake because he likes his work and he hoped his carvings would take on some of the poems characteristics PERIOD
They seem to have some of the feelings that come from Blakes poems Larkin said PERIOD They can be said to be very closely related. stacy Hegg an undergraduate student majoring in art history at St PERIOD Thomas said that after seeing the Erewhon series she is very interested in the literature for which these pieces are named PERIOD
If you read the book Im sure you would find parallels Hegg said PERIOD It is something that I would definitely look into reading. in addition to being an accomplished artist with works on display all over the world Larkin has been a teacher of design and art history for nearly a halfcentury PERIOD He has also published a book on design PERIOD
