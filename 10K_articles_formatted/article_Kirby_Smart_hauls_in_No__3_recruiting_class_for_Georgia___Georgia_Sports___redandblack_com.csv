Its been  days since Kirby Smart was hired to be the head coach of the Georgia Bulldogs PERIOD

After he led the Bulldogs to an underwhelming  record in his first season he delivered perhaps the biggest victory in his young headcoaching career on National Signing Day PERIOD

At the conclusion of signing day Georgia is ranked as the No PERIOD  recruiting class in the nation behind Alabama and Ohio State according to 247Sports ESPN and Rivals PERIOD

Exciting uneventful day if there is such a thing as one Smart said Wednesday PERIOD To bring these new guys into the program is really exciting for us as a staff. this class is now tied with the  recruits as the best haul in Georgias recruiting history since statistics have been kept PERIOD  featured players such as Matthew Stafford Knowshon Moreno and Akeem Dent who were integral parts in the Sugar Bowl victory in  PERIOD

 recruits and six early enrollees make up the  class for Georgia highlighted by fivestar players Richard LeCounte III and Isaiah Wilson PERIOD On top of that Georgia added the most fourstar recruits in the schools history with  total players PERIOD Thats three more fourstar recruits than back in  PERIOD

Smart recognized the effort his players had in recruiting and the difference that was made whether they be early enrollees or upperclassmen PERIOD

I had to put the reins on Richard LeCounte III and some of those guys because I think they thought they could recruit everybody in the country Smart said PERIOD Weve got a limited number of spots PERIOD Those guys are pretty aggressive. another factor that also helped give Smart an edge on the recruiting trail this year was time PERIOD

In comparison to  recruiting class Smart had to scramble to keep former Mark Richt administration recruits after the longtime head coach was fired PERIOD Smart was coming off a national championship with Alabama in the College Football Playoff and was hired on Dec PERIOD   PERIOD

He didnt have to worry about that this year PERIOD

I remember being at the national championship game and during the time I got to recruit I was on the phone with a lot of these guys Smart said PERIOD The target was were going to go after these guys and get a really good class the full cycle PERIOD It paid off this year. now with a full year under his belt one thing has become quite clear PERIOD This is Smarts recruiting class for better or for worse PERIOD

Many Georgia players recruits and early enrollees were buzzing on twitter as new commitments were coming in for the  class PERIOD
