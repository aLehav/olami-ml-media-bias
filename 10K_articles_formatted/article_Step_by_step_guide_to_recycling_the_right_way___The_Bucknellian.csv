One of the most overlooked conundrums of modern society is the topic of recycling PERIOD I for one have made the crucial mistake of putting waste in recycling bins and recyclables in waste bins PERIOD And to be frank until I joined the sustainability committee I did not think anything of it PERIOD

It is common for society to neglect problems such as these since they do not directly impact our everyday lives PERIOD However after taking the time to research the impacts of tossing waste in recycling bins I was shocked that I was willingly contributing to one of societys most pressing issues PERIOD

It was foolish of me to completely disregard a problem that I thought to be negligible given the vast repercussions that are associated with the issue at hand PERIOD It is true that placing recyclable items in a trashcan is not a pressing topic PERIOD In most cases our trash either is sent to wastetoenergy facilities or landfills which protect our environment from contaminants PERIOD Thus if recyclable items accidentally end up in landfills they can still be converted into energy proving that this is not the problem where we should be directing our attention PERIOD

The real problem lies in the waste that ends up in recycling bins PERIOD Not only does this waste contaminate the real recyclables that are meant to better the environment but it also creates issues at the plants that process the recyclables PERIOD

Hoses plastic bags and string lights that make their way to the plants can severely damage equipment and require tens of thousands of dollars to repair PERIOD On top of this misplaced shards of glass can put the wellbeing of workers at risk as oftentimes these workers need to handpick items out of piles PERIOD

Though the issue of contamination does not lead to broken machines or injured plant workers it can negatively impact recyclables that have already been processed PERIOD One toxin mixed in with a load of hundreds of processed recyclables is enough to spoil the entire batch PERIOD Unwanted pests create unclean conditions PERIOD The most commonly recycled products are greasy pizza boxes and jars caked with peanut butter PERIOD

While boxes and jars are classified as recyclables in theory most people do not ensure that these items are wiped clean before they are tossed into a recycling bin PERIOD A recyclable immediately becomes waste the instant it comes in contact with food PERIOD Under no circumstances should the remnants of food ever make their way into a recycling bin as the percentage of true recyclables will dwindle PERIOD

We must stop disregarding the pressing issues that are plaguing the world around us PERIOD Just because an issue does not directly affect us does not mean that we should continue to preserve the very actions that are causing them PERIOD

Every item correctly recycled is a repair job prevented a plant worker assisted and a sustainability goal met PERIOD Join me in turning selfishness into selflessness by making sure that recycling is carried out in the very way it was designed PERIOD Conduct the proper research and contribute to a healthier environment one step at a time PERIOD
