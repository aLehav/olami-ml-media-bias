3157,2023-11-04,"moral victories are hard to find in a close loss to a Top  team PERIOD

Just ask the mens soccer team PERIOD

The Golden Eagles fell to the 10thranked St PERIOD Johns Red Storm  Sunday after opening Big East play with a  tie against the Syracuse Orange on Friday PERIOD

Despite a gritty defensive effort Marquette could not hold off a Red Storm team that has never lost a home game during the regular season PERIOD

 head coach Steve Adlard said PERIOD

That lapse occurred in the sixty-eighth minute when a nice defensive stop turned into a mad scramble deep in Golden Eagles territory PERIOD

Junior midfielder Rob Walton stole the ball from a St PERIOD Johns forward and quickly turned to make a pass to sophomore defender Mike Carlson PERIOD

However the ball never made it to Carlson as another St PERIOD Johns striker intercepted the pass and proceeded down the left sideline PERIOD

The ball was crossed to the center of the field where Red Storm forward Gary Lewis drilled a shot into a sliding Nathan Sabich PERIOD

Sabich a junior defender could only watch from the ground as Lewis collected the ball off the ricochet and launched a shot past sophomore goalkeeper Andy Kroll PERIOD

 Sabich said PERIOD  

According to the box score the Golden Eagles recorded no shots on goal and only three shots total throughout the entire match PERIOD

Statistics did not account for the string of strong attacks Marquette ran on the Red Storm as the game clock wound down PERIOD

On one raid inside St PERIOD Johns box three Golden Eagles tried to force the ball into the net to no avail PERIOD

 Adlard said PERIOD  

No matter how close the match no matter how talented the foe the Golden Eagles take no solace in losing to any opponent PERIOD

 Carlson said of claiming moral victories PERIOD  

That record now  took a slight hit this weekend though the Golden Eagles felt confident coming off a  tie with Syracuse PERIOD

Marquette played tentatively to start its first game in a new conference PERIOD

 said freshman forward Duncan SilvertNoftle PERIOD 

After allowing a goal in the twentieth minute by Orange forward Pete Rowley the Golden Eagles defense put the clamps down on Syracuses offense PERIOD

For the rest of the match it was Marquette putting the squeeze on the Orange PERIOD

Late in the second half Sabich onetouched a pass to senior midfielder Blair Kohlmeyer PERIOD

Kohlmeyer was fouled but quickly got up and shot a low bending ball to a charging SilvertNoftle PERIOD

SilvertNoftle redirected the ball toward the far post beyond the reach of Syracuse goalkeeper Robert Cavicchia PERIOD

The score remained  at the end of regulation but the Golden Eagles kept charging in overtime PERIOD

Freshman midfielder Jamie Zarse led a Marquette attack that outshot the Orange  in extended play PERIOD

Zarse hit the crossbar on a shot attempt marking the Golden Eagles best chance to put the game away PERIOD

 Adlard said PERIOD  Syracuse 

While the Big East did not role out a welcome mat for the Golden Eagles the mens soccer team now knows they have what it takes to compete in their new conference PERIOD

 Sabich said PERIOD
