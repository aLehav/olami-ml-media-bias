The promotion of critical thinking and scientific understanding is something that is gravely lacking in our country PERIOD I also believe it is one of the primary reasons we are relinquishing our place in the world as a superpower PERIOD Apparently Im not alone PERIOD

This summer I got to cover The Amazing Meeting the countrys largest annual conference focused on science and skepticism PERIOD

Currently in its ninth year TAM is hosted by the James Randi Educational Foundation a group founded in  by James The Amazing Randi a magician who has spent much of his life working to debunk and discredit all things paranormal and pseudoscientific PERIOD

This years conference TAM  from Outer Space was held in Las Vegas on July  PERIOD It focused mainly on human exploration and advancements in science PERIOD

Many of the presenters were some of the worlds top scientists and critical thinkers but one of the most powerful talks came from astronomer and Southern Illinois University professor Pamela Gay PERIOD

Gays address was meant to motivate the crowd at TAM to take a more active role in advocating future science research and exploration or more specifically to make sure funding goes through for the James Webb Space Telescope PERIOD

Science is something that inspires it creates technologies it makes lives better Gay said in an interview PERIOD

However the bad economy is shifting our priorities It is very hard today to fight to advance science PERIOD This is why youve heard me fighting not to cut it she said PERIOD

The JWST is in some ways the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope which has been in orbit since  but it is a much more impressive and important observation tool for outer space research PERIOD

Unlike the Hubble the JWST sees infrared wavelengths PERIOD This will allow it to see the most distant objects of the universe including stars approximately  million years older than what can be seen now with Hubble PERIOD

There are numerous reasons this new technology is so important PERIOD The JWST could teach us about the beginnings of our universe and help us predict the future of our planet PERIOD It is also designed to make constant service missionsfive were necessary for Hubblea thing of the past PERIOD

NASA has already spent . billion on the JWST and recently said it expects the ultimate price tag of the project to reach . billion PERIOD This bill is supposed to be paid by the agencys science division which has a  budget of  billion PERIOD While the division has taken care of all costs up until now it has asked NASA to pitch in with money from other departments to split the remaining expenses PERIOD

This new proposal is currently waiting at the White Houses Office of Management and Budget PERIOD If it denies this plan it is likely the JWST will never receive the funding it needs to get off the ground and into orbit PERIOD

It is true that there are already plans for more advanced telescopes and on May   the European Space Agency launched the Herschel Space Observatory which can see even longer wavelengths than the JWST PERIOD But these are not excuses to let the JWST fall off the radar PERIOD

In fact they add to the importance of keeping plans for the JWST on track PERIOD As a country one of our biggest faults is letting ourselves fall behind in scientific discovery PERIOD Some might say this is because so much has already been discovered PERIOD But if you consider how long humans have been on this planet and how much of our understanding has come in the last century you begin to grasp how much is left for us to know PERIOD The JWST is the next step PERIOD

The OMB must accept the recent budget proposal for the JWST and our nation must stand behind all future funding for this project PERIOD

We are about to get a fairly rude awakening as a nation Gay said PERIOD This year China became No PERIOD  in the world for science and math education PERIOD India is catching up quickly PERIOD As they begin to surpass us as they begin to call in the debt the only way our country is going to drag itself back into a position of prominence is through science and technology. if we begin to deny the importance of research science like observing the farthest corners of our universe we may be closer to an apocalyptic ending than my fellow skeptics would like to believe PERIOD

Space is an expansive beast and weve just begun to understand our own surroundings PERIOD The JWST is the future of space research and the advancement of space research is the future of our species and possibly our only hope PERIOD
