by  Brian DeutschPublished  February  

Although she plays under the radar on the Minnesota womens hockey team Dagney Willey leads the team when it comes to making contributions off the ice PERIOD

The sophomore spends what little free time she has working with the Big Brothers Big Sisters program PERIOD

The defenseman volunteers with 12year old Kelsey Theriot a Hurricane Katrina survivor who came to Minnesota with her mother and two siblings PERIOD

Kelseys family is originally from St PERIOD Bernard Parish La. but moved to Golden Valley after Katrina destroyed their home PERIOD

We rode it out in our apartment until the levees broke and the water started coming in said Cindy Weinmann Kelseys mom PERIOD We ended up in Baton Rouge and then about a week and a half later we made it up here. katrina devastated St PERIOD Bernard Parish which is in the New Orleans metropolitan area with as much as  feet of flooding during the storm PERIOD

The hurricane damaged almost every building in the parish including the apartment building the family lived in PERIOD

The family made its way to Minnesota where it stayed with Kelseys greataunt before finding a place of its own PERIOD

A short while later a friend suggested the Big Brothers Big Sisters program to Kelseys mom PERIOD

Kelsey and her sister Macy  both joined the program PERIOD Macy works with a fellow Katrina survivor while Kelsey was paired up with Willey PERIOD

Willey said she had thought about volunteering in a program like Big Brothers Big Sisters since she was in high school but her first real volunteering experience came during her freshman year at the University when she joined Athletes Committed to Educating Students with teammate Andrea Nichols PERIOD

ACES is a Minneapolisbased mentoring program that promotes education and healthy life choices for innercity youths PERIOD

That same year Willey also earned the Gophers Ridder Award which is given to the player who is the most active within the community PERIOD

From there Willey looked into the Big Brothers Big Sisters program PERIOD She said she thought about it for about a week before deciding it was the program for her PERIOD

After applying and going through the interview process Willey was matched up with Kelsey in June  PERIOD

During their first meeting the duo played volleyball and Frisbee while getting to know each other PERIOD

Kelsey is kind of quiet around people that she doesnt know Weinmann said PERIOD But she is really into sports and games. since then the pair has made many trips to Minnesota Twins games the driving range and even a football game at Willeys high school PERIOD

The twosome found a common interest in sports where both said they consider themselves tomboys PERIOD

Its funny because she is a lot similar to me when I was a kid Willey said PERIOD

While Willey played boys hockey for  years Kelsey prefers the basketball court over the ice PERIOD

Willey said one of her most rewarding moments was when she watched one of Kelseys basketball games PERIOD

It was the first time she had done an organized sport and her coaches said how much she has improved and how she works so hard Willey said PERIOD I just remember the way she beamed up when I came to the game. kelsey said she was excited when Willey came to her basketball game and she said her trips to Ridder Arena for Gophers games are always a fun experience PERIOD

Earlier this year Kelsey and her family watched as Willey and the Gophers picked up a win against Ohio State in a game where Willey notched an assist PERIOD

Although Kelsey said hanging out with Willey is always fun the  year old is still unsure of whether she likes Minnesotas cold climate PERIOD

But with Willeys help Kelsey has been able to weather the storm PERIOD
