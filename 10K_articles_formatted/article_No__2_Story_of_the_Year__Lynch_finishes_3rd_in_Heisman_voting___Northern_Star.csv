Redshirt senior quarterback Jordan Lynch carries the ball against Purdue Sep PERIOD  in West Lafayette Ind PERIOD Lynch threw for  yards and  touchdowns and rushed for  yards and  touchdowns in his Heisman campaign PERIOD

By  Brian EarleApril  

After a recordbreaking season quarterback Jordan Lynch became the first player in NIU to be nominated for the Heisman Trophy finishing in third place PERIOD

It wasnt the first season in which Lynch gained national recognition PERIOD As a redshirt junior in  Lynch finished No PERIOD  in the Heisman voting PERIOD

In his senior season Lynch upped the ante with a historical No PERIOD  finish in the Heisman voting taking a trip to New York with six finalists PERIOD Lynch finished No PERIOD  behind quarterbacks Jameis Winston who won the Heisman and AJ McCarron PERIOD He received  votes and placed on  firstplace ballots despite playing in the MAC which is considered to be a lesser conference by many of the Heisman voters PERIOD

Lynchs finish tied him for the highest finish by a nonBCS player since Hawaii quarterback Colt Brennan finished third in  PERIOD

Lynch now sits atop the MAC with the greatest finish in Heisman history ahead of Marshall wide receiver Randy Moss who finished fourth in  PERIOD Lynch was the MACs first Heisman finalist since Marshall quarterback Chad Pennington in  PERIOD Those three are the only MAC Heisman finalists in history PERIOD

Lynch started to gain more attention after he broke the record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game and then broke his own record later in the season PERIOD He started to gain much more national recognition once the Huskies started playing their midweek televised games on ESPN  in November PERIOD

Coach Rod Carey lobbied for his quarterback as a Heisman finalist PERIOD

If Jordan isnt in the conversation for the Heisman I dont know what people are watching Carey said according to a Nov PERIOD  Northern Star article PERIOD They obviously were asleep PERIOD In my estimation that trophy goes to the best player in the nation OK.
