Brad Thompson associate professor of mass communication has just asked a question of the sports journalism symposium panel PERIOD

Chris Ballard senior writer for Sports Illustrated leans forward to the microphone and says You have to tell a story go into depth PERIOD Just start in the moment PERIOD If you take us into the narrative the reader cant stop reading. the question he had just answered centered on keeping your articles current and relevant and entertaining in a world where attentions spans are measured in seconds PERIOD

Lindsey Schnell a writer for Sports Illustrated provided her own input PERIOD

Its really hard PERIOD As you are writing a breaking news story you have to think Whats the big picture here What are the longterm effects You have to think like a reader and Im not good at that sometimes she said PERIOD

Linfield provides students with many opportunities to educate themselves not only inclass but also outside of it and the first ever sports journalism symposium Feb PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD was a perfect example of that PERIOD

Ballard Schnell and Scott Brosius Linfield baseball head coach presented on the panel drawing on their wisdom from the sides of the journalists and athletes PERIOD

A large part of the panel focused on interviewing athletes who didnt want to be interviewed such as Marshawn Lynch of the Seattle Seahawks who has repeatedly used the phrase Im only here so I wont get fined when asked questions by the media PERIOD

The way I did it was to approach him as a human being PERIOD You want to tell their story and you want to tell it empathetically Ballard said PERIOD

He pointed out how it made interviews go a lot easier when the journalist approached as a human being first and then as a journalist PERIOD

On the other side of it Brosius pointed out that sometimes you wont get the interview you wanted PERIOD

Pick your time and choose when to have certain questions PERIOD You may not get the story when you wanted to Brosius said PERIOD

He discussed his own experience as an athlete where one of the flashier articles written about him had the headline Struggling Brosius is atrocious. he shared this experience with the media in order for both journalism and sports students to get a perspective on this PERIOD He did disagreed with some of what the journalist wrote and brought this up to him the next time they met PERIOD

We ended up in a shouting match and when its all said and done what did that really accomplish

Schnell pointed out that as a journalist you have to be aware that you may be burning bridges and you need to decide if that story youre going to write is worth that PERIOD

Its important for me to have a good relationship with people PERIOD Your obligation is to your readers Schnell said PERIOD

Ballard brought up the point that no matter what you write and how you write it someone is going to find fault with it PERIOD

To end the panel Thompson asked a question he encourages any journalist to ask at the end of any interview Is there anything you would like to say that you havent been asked about

The panelists focused on finding success in a world of constant competition PERIOD

Schnell brought up a thought she had mentioned earlier PERIOD

You have to believe you are good enough to be hired Schnell said PERIOD

We have these aspirations to get to the top and it just doesnt happen PERIOD What separates the people that get there and the people that dont is hard work Brosius said PERIOD

And Ballad ended the panel by telling students to ask themselves Why not whenever an opportunity was offered because it is through those opportunities that they make it to where they want to be PERIOD
