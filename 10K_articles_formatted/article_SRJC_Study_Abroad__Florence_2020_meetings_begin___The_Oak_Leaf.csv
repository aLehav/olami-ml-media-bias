Allison Khadoo Staff WriterSeptember  

Santa Rosa Junior College Professor Jeanette Ben Farhat held the first study abroad meeting for students interested in the Spring  trip to Florence Italy on Aug PERIOD  PERIOD

Ben Farhat painted the vibrant life of Florence by discussing cultural activities and architecture only found in Florence PERIOD A few highlights mentioned were the Duomo Cathedral and varying artworkfrom Michelangelos David to local street art PERIOD

According to Ben Farhat the greatest benefit of studying abroad is the opportunity to immerse yourself in a different culture not as a tourist but as a temporary resident PERIOD

Living abroad allows you to experience a different way of life and to view your own society from a different perspective PERIOD In an interconnected world developing a global perspective is an important life and career skill Ben Farhat said PERIOD

After receiving ample information on the study abroad program many students at the meeting seemed convinced PERIOD

I want to study abroad because I feel like its the best way to learn and appreciate another culture said SRJC nursing major Jillian Raiger PERIOD In the meeting honestly I learned that you can become friends with people in an hour and that if you are open minded you can create longlasting friendships. the meeting also covered fees and types of courses offered PERIOD

The fee is  per person with options for a meal plan and transportation package PERIOD

The fee of nearly  includes apartment accommodations in the center of Florence a student orientation covering safety transportation and cultural differences a half day guided walking tour of Florence and a welcome reception PERIOD A study center with 24hour emergency services a weekly culture class guided day trips to the Tuscan towns of Siena and San Gimignano free WiFi and a mandatory police registration are also included PERIOD

The program despite seeming like a vacation is still very academically centered PERIOD

One important thing to know before studying abroad is that you actually have to study. the semester is compressed into  weeks and it moves quickly so you cant spend all of your time traveling Ben Farhat said PERIOD

Classes are offered not only through Santa Rosa Junior College but also through three other community collegesContra Costa Los Rios and San Mateo PERIOD These colleges offer a similar program and have students that travel alongside the SRJC PERIOD Introductory courses in English sociology anthropology and political science are some of the courses offered PERIOD

The program departs for Florence on Feb PERIOD   and ends May   PERIOD

The deadline to apply is Sept PERIOD  for priority and Nov PERIOD  for the general application PERIOD
