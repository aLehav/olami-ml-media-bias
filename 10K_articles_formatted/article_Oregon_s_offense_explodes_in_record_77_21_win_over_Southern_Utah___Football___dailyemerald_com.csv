Head coach Willie Taggart could not have asked for a better start from his offense in his first career game at Oregon PERIOD

The Ducks scored the most points in a game in  years breaking the Autzen Stadium record which stood at  PERIOD

On a hot and smoky Saturday in Eugene Oregons offense scored  points in each of the first three quarters generated  yards of total offense and defeated Southern Utah  to open the  season at Autzen Stadium PERIOD The rush game totaled  yards while sophomore quarterback Justin Herbert went 17for21 for  yards and one touchdown PERIOD

I thought our guys were ready to play Taggart said PERIOD I felt that way all week PERIOD Our guys went out and performed the way they should have PERIOD It wasnt as pretty as we would like for it to be but there was a lot of things we can correct PERIOD But I thought our guys really took care of business. tony BrooksJames erupted for a 100yard kick return to start the game and the Ducks didnt step off the gas pedal PERIOD

After Southern Utah tied the game on a nine play 70yard drive the Ducks went on a 35point streak which included two touchdowns each from running backs Royce Freeman and Kani Benoit PERIOD Freeman finished with four touchdowns and  yards while Benoit had  yards in seven carries PERIOD

It was just getting them the ball and letting them do what they do best Taggart said PERIOD

Oregons run game was always going to be important and it was stressed throughout fall camp PERIOD The Ducks scored nine rushing touchdowns the most in a single game in the programs history PERIOD

Oregon running back Royce Freeman  tumbles into the endzone during the third quarter PERIOD The Oregon Ducks start their season playing against the Southern Utah Thunderbirds at Autzen Stadium in Eugene Ore PERIOD on September   PERIOD Theo MechainEmerald

The offensive line which returns a plethora of players with experience under their belts was able to get the job done PERIOD

I thought they did what they were supposed to Taggart said PERIOD Overall it starts there and those guys open those doors for Royce and Kani and Tony PERIOD They did a good job of protecting Justin PERIOD I thought they did well enough. even as the game became unreachable for the Thunderbirds the Ducks did not stop PERIOD

Herbert got comfortable in the pocket finding Charles Nelson Jacob Breeland and even freshman Johnny Johnson III for a 37yard catch PERIOD A 50yard find of Nelson set the Ducks up inside the five PERIOD

Theyve done a really great job Herbert said PERIOD Guys like Johnny Johnson and Dillon Mitchell stepped up big time PERIOD Johnny had a heck of a catch and I trust those guys completely. herbert was able to rely heavily on his running backs but when he decided to launch some throws downfield he was quite accurate PERIOD

I told him after the game I was proud of him Taggart said PERIOD We have a football team thats willing to play for him and I think whenever you get that as a quarterback theres a lot of good things that can happen. follow Shawn Medow on Twitter ShawnMedow
