5437,2015-07-05,"keys for a United States win

Convert chances Throughout the World Cup the United States has done a good job of creating scoring opportunities but has failed to score many goals off of them PERIOD The team has averaged about  shots per game but only managed to have  of those on target PERIOD If the U.S PERIOD can convert most of itschances it could end up scoring at least two or three goals which would be an ideal amount PERIOD

Prevent counterattacks If it doesnt contain Japan the U.S PERIOD could end up conceding several easy goals something that could end up making a huge difference in a close game PERIOD One way to prevent counterattacks is to hold onto the ball by making the right passes PERIOD If the U.S PERIOD can do that Japan will have trouble getting into open space PERIOD

Set pieces The U.S PERIOD has to take what Japan gives PERIOD In this case it is a favorable size advantage that could make a difference with free kicks and corners PERIOD If the U.S PERIOD doesnt take advantage Japan will scorch the team with its superior speed and quickness PERIOD

Get key players involved Alex Morgan has been nonexistent this World Cup PERIOD Part of this could be due to the fact that Carli Lloyd has been put in more of an attacking role PERIOD Lloyd has been superb in that role but Japan should be all over her after seeing scouting reports PERIOD That gives players like Alex Morgan who have underperformed a chance to make a real difference PERIOD

Keys for a Japan win

Forcing mistakes Japan relies on its quickness and speed so if it can force turnovers and get on the counterattack the team will be tough to stop PERIOD Counterattacks can often be momentumshifting so they are absolutely vital for Japan PERIOD

Possession If Japan holds onto the ball the team will be able to control the tempo of the game and at the same time keep a very dangerous U.S PERIOD attack at bay PERIOD Over the first six games of the World Cup Japan has managed to concede only three goals by consistently winning the possession battle PERIOD A lack of possession on the other hand would make Japan extremely tired PERIOD Like the previous World Cup final this game could end up being evenly matched and thus extend for a long time PERIOD In situations like that fitness is absolutely vital so Japan must make sure thatitdoesnt get fatigued PERIOD

Confidence It has been a rough World Cup for Japan and the team hasnt been in its best form PERIOD In fact most would say that Japan is lucky to even be competing for the title PERIOD If it werent for a questionable penalty call and an unfortunate own goal it could have lost to England in the semifinal PERIOD Regardless Japan must get back into good form if itwants a chance to win PERIOD

Spreading the wealth Japan needs to get all of its players involved PERIOD Throughout the World Cup a total team effort is what has gotten Japan to an undefeated record PERIOD In fact seven Japanese players have scored a total of eight goals PERIOD Other than the brilliant Aya Miyama there is no other star on the Japanese team PERIOD The teamwins by getting everyone involved PERIOD

Players to watch

Carli Lloyd USA She has arguably been one of the best players for the United States PERIOD She not only leads the team in scoring with three goals thus far in the competition but is also an absolute rock in the midfield and controls that area of the pitch PERIOD

Aya Miyama JPN She was a differencemaker for the Japanese back in  and she still is now in  PERIOD In fact she leads the team in both goals and assists with two of each PERIOD

Prediction

Even though Japan has advantages in both its technical ability and quickness the United States hasbeen on a roll after impressive wins against China and Germany PERIOD In both games the U.S PERIOD conceded no goals as it shut down the opposition PERIOD If the U.S were to lose on Sunday it would take a miraculous comeback like the one Japan constructed in the previous final PERIOD If that doesnt happen the U.S should win comfortably considering the team isplaying with a lot at stake PERIOD
United States  Japan

Nearly four years ago the Japanese national team pulled off one of the most improbable victories in Womens World Cup history PERIOD

Trailing by a goal two different times during the match and with their chances of claiming the title evaporating by the second the Japanese were able to eliminateU.S PERIOD leads and tie up the game both at the end of regulation and overtime PERIOD Finally after a nervewracking shootout the team was able to escape with the win PERIOD It was a monumental and wellfought victory for the Japanese who were at the time trying to rebound from the treacherous tsunami and earthquake that shocked their nation a few months before PERIOD

But for the Americans July   is a day that will forever haunt them PERIOD That is unless they can bring back the cup on Sunday PERIOD

It hurts to think about it and talk about it U.S PERIOD captain Carli Lloyd recently told USA Today PERIOD There is nothing I want more than the chance to put it right. leaving Vancouver with this win is not just important for the teams morale but for the country as a whole PERIOD The United States hasnt been able to win a World Cup title since its historical run in  PERIOD Each time since the team has been among the favorites but has fallen short PERIOD And just when it seemed like  would be its year the United States hopes were crushed PERIOD The team has reached the same spot against the same team and once again has a chance at making history PERIOD

Veterans including Abby Wambach Hope Solo Alex Morgan and Lloyd are trying to rewrite the script PERIOD Wambach has been through the most turmoil failing to win a single World Cup in her three appearances so far PERIOD The loss to Japan seems to have been by far the worst for her PERIOD And its her last chance to avenge it PERIOD

Its been a constant reminder since July   she told Newsday before Sundays match PERIOD Its been that thing that fuels our fire that motivates us to do that extra sprint to make that extra fight to extend and to search for that ball PERIOD Its always there PERIOD Thats what happens with heartbreak PERIOD Heartbreak never goes away. this year the United States came into the tournament ranked second in the world just behind Germany while the Japanese were ranked fourth PERIOD Like in  the Japanese are again heavy underdogs given only a  percent chance of victory according to WSPI and have only beaten the United States once in the31 matches between the two teams  that one time being the  World Cup finals PERIOD But as witnessed four years ago even the unthinkable is possible for Japan PERIOD

Yes a United States vs PERIOD Germany matchup is what the soccer fans wanted but a victory against Japan would mean so much more to the players and the country PERIOD And in a country where soccer is growing at a fast pace a World Cup title may possibly ignite a soccer craze or at least inspire young soccer athletes PERIOD

Japan deserved the victory last time around PERIOD But after  years of pain and misery America rightfully deserves its third cup PERIOD Defeating Japan would be a true storybook ending PERIOD
