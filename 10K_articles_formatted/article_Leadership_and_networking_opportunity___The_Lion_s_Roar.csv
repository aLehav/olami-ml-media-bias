Being a Division for Student Affairs Leadership Ambassador offers opportunities for networking leadership skills personal development and camaraderie PERIOD

I have become very fascinated with DSA said senior political science and communication major Eugene Davis PERIOD It has allowed me to be able to connect with other students on campus in a way that I havent before I joined and Ive learned a lot as a student PERIOD Ive learned a lot as a leader and Im still growing. the ambassadors help with recruitment development of leadership education and promotion of school spirit PERIOD

The DSA Leadership Ambassadors volunteer their time to plan out different events for leadership development such as the Lions LEAD Retreat and we also share our experiences with incoming college students said sophomore kinesiology major OLivia Shaw PERIOD We help service our campus as well as our community and were always supporting Southeastern and making our school known. sophomore early childhood education grades PreK3 major Rebecca Armanini became interested in being an ambassador after attending a retreat last year PERIOD

It helped me to move forwards so I can now speak in front of people and tell them about myself said Shrestha PERIOD And then I can just talk freely right now PERIOD It helped me so that I could go in front of everyone PERIOD Even in a crowd I could go in front and just talk. shrestha shared why he became an ambassador PERIOD

I chose to join it so that I could help others also so that I could help teach others help them to learn the leadership skills said Shrestha PERIOD

According to Armanini networking and getting to know campus organizations is an advantage of the position PERIOD

Anybody whos interested in being involved on campus but maybe they dont want to start off at SGA like a high position this would be a good place to start cause you can work with a lot of other organizations through DSA and kinda learn and get a feel for the campus itself said Armanini PERIOD So maybe youre Oh I wanna stick with DSA this year but once you learn about the other organizations you can be like Wow I like this one a lot more PERIOD I think Ill do both next year. and then kinda build your leadership and just everything else you wanna do through that. armanini cited the people she works with as her favorite part of being an ambassador PERIOD

We have four or five meetings a week trying to make decisions said Varnado PERIOD So it would be me and TyronE at one point PERIOD Then it would be us and our committee at another point and then it would be us and the higher ups kind of deciding over different things PERIOD And then also all the ambassadors together so thats a bunch of things. armanini described other challenges she has faced beyond preparing for the retreat PERIOD

We faced some budget cuts through SGA this year so that means we as DSA face them as well said Armanini PERIOD So we dont have as much money for the retreat this year but its gonna work out thankfully. the ambassadors can also be found on Instagram at the Office for Student Engagements official page SoutheaternOSE PERIOD Anyone interested in becoming an ambassador is encouraged to attend the Lions LEAD Retreat scheduled for March  PERIOD
