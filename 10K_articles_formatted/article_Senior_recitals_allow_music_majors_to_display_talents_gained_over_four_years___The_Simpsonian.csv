As finals week approaches most seniors are just looking to get through their last semester of college while maintaining their sanity PERIOD But for seniors in the Simpson College music department however they still have one more obstacle to overcome  their senior recitals PERIOD

The senior recital is the last step in a series of proficiencies that music and performance majors must complete in order to graduate from the programs PERIOD

Throughout the first three years students are required to pass a music proficiency exam a multitude of music proficiency performances weekly recitals and performances in studio classes PERIOD

Their senior recital then consists of an hour recital of music varying in language genre artistic settings and musical compositions PERIOD

Most seniors say that preparing for a senior recital is a matter of time management PERIOD Aside from the necessary practicing students also receive voice lessons with instructions to better understand compositions and their interpretations PERIOD

They then work with an accompanist and their instructor often times scheduling their practices in their free time and mutual schedule openings throughout the day PERIOD

Senior Shannon Prickett says she has had to put together a tight knit schedule in order to deal with the stress PERIOD

My preparation could always be better she said PERIOD You really learn to manage time well PERIOD Its a lot of work. prickett is also juggling work and a  credit hour schedule PERIOD

I would definitely say the hardest part was putting a life together in between  large opera roles  graduate school auditions and my school work she said PERIOD I had to put in tons of extra effort its a lot of stuff that could easily be put off. prickett will be performing  pieces in her program in Italian German English and French PERIOD She also finalized a grad school submission to Indiana University and will be studying with Professor of Music Carol Vaness a renowned soprano artist PERIOD

For some it wasnt the graduate auditions and all the credit hours but more about getting the entire program put together that was difficult PERIOD

Ive put a lot of work into it and its been a lot of work getting coachings in with my voice teacher and my accompanist senior Jesse Stock said PERIOD I spent a lot of time learning exactly what I was saying and a lot of time practicing you cant ever practice enough. although a good portion of senior music students do go on to graduate school others go straight on to work PERIOD

Im not really heading to graduate school at the moment senior Adam Skog said PERIOD I dont feel musically ready for that PERIOD I am currently wrapping up a student teaching job and hopefully will take a teaching job after the summer. skogs recital was a program filled with  pieces with an Italian set and pieces in German French and English PERIOD He also performed a French aria PERIOD

When youre involved in school activities it becomes even harder to put on a recital like that he said PERIOD Im doing Madrigal and choir and its more work than youd think it was onehundred and some pieces to memorize for Madrigal. while most of the work lies in the actual performance theres additional performance factors that keep listeners involved PERIOD

Its all about how to make your music come alive once youve learned it Prickett said PERIOD You cant just say all these words in a foreign language to people and expect them to stay interested PERIOD You have to find ways to communicate with your audience try to make them see what youre saying. prickett and Stock both have senior recital dates quickly approaching PERIOD Pricketts recital will be held on Wednesday April  at  p.m PERIOD in Lekberg Hall PERIOD Stocks recital will be held on Friday April  at  p.m PERIOD in Lekberg Hall PERIOD
