Vegetarian PERIOD  Vegan PERIOD  Freegan

Most people are familiar with the idea behind vegetarianism and veganism PERIOD  But what is freeganism

According to freegan.info Freegans are people who employ alternative strategies for living based on limited participation in the conventional economy and minimal consumption of resources PERIOD Freegans embrace community generosity social concern freedom cooperation and sharing in opposition to a society based on materialism moral apathy competition conformity and greed. however those familiar with freeganism summarize it much more succinctly PERIOD  Strict freegans are people who dont pay for food or anything else PERIOD

I am capable of eating roadkill or sloppy garbage said freegan Theodore Schmidkonz PERIOD  Ive seem many people here in America go into wet sloppy garbage and throw it in a bucket and light a fire under it and eat it  and these guys have been doing it for  or  years. schmidkonz isnt the only one who will eat food of questionable integrity PERIOD  One source from Santa Cruz who wished to remain anonymous said he cooks up roadkill as a source of protein PERIOD  He and his friends often eat fish they catch themselves and he routinely enters UCSC campus dining halls illegally for free meals PERIOD

While Santa Cruz is home to of a number of freegans the freegan lifestyle isnt just a Santa Cruz phenomenon PERIOD

Schmidkonz a professional nurse lives in a freegan community in Mount Laguna CA PERIOD  The community consists mainly of leanto shelters and yurts and a couple of trailers he said PERIOD

About  people stop by the collection of shelters each day to trade and barter for food PERIOD  The last thing we do is use money Schmidkonz said PERIOD  Some would say its anarchistic PERIOD  Perhaps it is to a degree. while some choose the freegan lifestyle for political reasons others like Schmikonz choose it for financial reasons PERIOD  Were scraping by individually on several hundred dollars apiece and the only way we can do it is being freegan Schmidkonz said PERIOD

His community is one of a very small number of similarly freegan communities across the country PERIOD  According to Schmidkonz Were focused on benevolent activities recycling clean living and mutual survival and coexistence PERIOD  We try to be as independent as we possibly can. for freegans part of this independence also means growing some of their own food PERIOD  Schmidkonzs community which covers about a third of an acre has a plum tree an apple tree and a fig tree PERIOD  They also had a yearround organic garden but the upkeep became too strenuous for Schmidkonz alone to maintain PERIOD

Much of the food that freegans eat is salvaged from dumpsters behind bakeries or places like Safeway Trader Joes and New Leaf PERIOD  This method of reclaiming food called dumpster diving is difficult in Santa Cruz where most dumpsters are locked up or are inaccessible PERIOD  However this doesnt seem to prevent freegans and others from accessing the trash PERIOD

Trader Joes is really good said Eric Pellissier a freegan who attended UCSC last year before transferring to community college PERIOD  I found ridiculous amounts of stuff there PERIOD  I found  of steak that was still frozen  the latest thing we found was  cheesecakes. eleanor Wasserman a freegan and student at UCSC also testified to the quality of food found in dumpsters PERIOD  Ive been to New Leaf and scored a bunch of vegetables she said PERIOD  The vegetables are totally fine  if they werent we wouldnt take them PERIOD  Why waste it

Though sometimes some freegans draw the line PERIOD  D PERIOD Scott Newton a freegan from Monterey Bay stays away from food with flies on it food with rotting parts he said PERIOD Meat Id be cautious about but I think a crock pot might handle any marginal contamination. newton has been a freegan for three months and still considers himself a newcomer to the lifestyle he only eats two meals a week as a freegan PERIOD

I was invited to eat a freefood meal with some folks and was surprised at how good it was Newton said PERIOD  Then I couldnt help but notice dumpsters full of good food behind certain restaurants and stores. it may sound too good to be true but dumpster diving is still illegal so it requires careful planning PERIOD Theres only a certain number of dumpsters and certain windows of time theyre available Schmidkonz said PERIOD

Schmidkonz bikes around to a variety of places where hes had good luck before PERIOD  Most of the food we gather is done on the weekend at nights PERIOD  Ive got a route of places that are about  or  minutes from here. schmidkonz proudly enumerated the variety of food hes gathered from dumpsters PERIOD  This last Sunday I went out and I did my routine and I came back with a little utility trailer filled with those prepared packaged salads that you usually pay five or six bucks a pop for PERIOD  I had two of them for lunch. he also found organic bananas raspberries blueberries and strawberries out of which he made smoothies PERIOD

According to Wasserman being freegan is what you make of it. while a traditional stricter freegan will not pay for any food there are a broad range of lifestyles that fall under the freegan category PERIOD  Some people who consider themselves freegan pay for vegetables and only eat meat if its next stop is the trashcan PERIOD  Some freegans who are just starting out will eat several meals a week as a freegan using only food that would have been wasted otherwise PERIOD

Wasserman described a freegan as someone who is conscious of the capitalistic way animals are treated PERIOD  Im against that. wasserman buys nonanimal products and eats animal products only if they will be thrown out otherwise PERIOD  I definitely buy a lot of vegetables  I try to make sure its local and seasonal she said PERIOD  Wasserman summarizes her lifestyle as vegan but said she will eat meat to eliminate food waste PERIOD  This is a fairly common practice for many freegans eating food even if its animalbased with the intent of reducing waste is better than knowing it will end up in a landfill PERIOD

Wasserman gave an example PERIOD  It was my birthday and my friend made me these really nice cookies with eggs in them so I took them PERIOD  I try to be as vegan as possible but I do have a sweet tooth. for some diet is not the only aspect of a freegan lifestyle PERIOD  Politics and other types of purchases also factor into freeganism PERIOD

Right now I dont really buy anything said Pellissier who attended UCSC for a year and now attends a community college PERIOD  I never buy clothes  I still buy gas because I have to get to college. some freegans believe that spending money only contributes to a capitalist society PERIOD  Freegan.info explains the logic behind the lifestyle Freeganism is a total boycott of an economic system  instead of avoiding the purchase of products from one bad company only to support another we avoid buying anything to the greatest degree we are able. some have other reasons PERIOD  I think in a general sort of way Im an anarchist Schmidkonz said PERIOD  Im into selfsufficiency and individual survival PERIOD  I think that the prevailing system here in the United States is beyond destructive  Theres no such thing as selfdetermination or democracy PERIOD  Its ridiculous PERIOD  Its nonsense. yet for Newton This isnt political PERIOD  Well maybe a tiny bit of anticonsumerism. pellissier also doesnt feel his lifestyle choice reflects a political opinion PERIOD  Politics dont really relate that much to not buying a sandwich at Subway he said PERIOD Its not that political. due to the controversial nature and questionable legality of the freegan lifestyle many critics have come forward PERIOD

One member of the forum veganpresent.com is vehemently against the freegan lifestyle and expressed this opinion on the forum PERIOD  By associating yourself with veganism when youll eat anything as long as you dont buy it yourself  doesnt make you freegan it makes you cheap. jessica Walker a Santa Cruz resident and Cabrillo College student finds a moral contradiction in the freegan lifestyle PERIOD  She defined a freegan as a vegan who justifies using products derived from animals as long as the person isnt the primary consumer. if youre not doing everything you can to work against animal exploitation then youre not being a good vegan Walker said PERIOD To have an extreme lifestyle and then say Its okay to break these rules  it seems like a very convenient loophole. freegans are well aware of their opponents viewpoints PERIOD You hear all these deprecating comments about parasitism and to a degree some of its true Schmidkonz said PERIOD  But people in urban environments dont have access to the land and thats the key PERIOD  They dont have access to a source of production. many freegans have trouble telling their friends about their lifestyle PERIOD  Some are against the choice to be freegan even if they are considered liberallyminded PERIOD

Also freegans tend to want to keep their lifestyles from becoming public knowledge PERIOD  Often once businesses and organizations get wind that their dumpsters are being raided they tend to lock their dumpsters or put up fences PERIOD

But while they may not be wellknown and they may not be popular freegans have found an underground niche in the Santa Cruz community PERIOD

I think people who pick up those kinds of lifestyles are on the right track to a progressive lifestyle Walker said PERIOD  Its just funny to live your life in such an extreme way. city on a Hill Press is produced by and for UCSC students PERIOD Our primary goal is to report and analyze issues affecting the student population and the Santa Cruz community PERIOD
