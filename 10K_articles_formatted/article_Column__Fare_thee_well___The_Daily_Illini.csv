As you all know by now Im laming it up here this summer PERIOD That means my graduation party wont be until August which suits me just fine PERIOD Its not that Im too cool to hang out with my family or that I dont enjoy being handed large sums of money PERIOD Im just sick of people asking me So what are you going to do now Next time this happens Im just going to pretend to think on it for a minute and say I think I might get bangs. at least no one can say I havent done anything to start my writing career PERIOD The Daily Illini has finally given me something to put on my resume PERIOD I also have a plump portfolio filled with hilarious yet thought provoking articles which are bound to keep me warm when Im living on the streets PERIOD The trick is to crumple them up and put them in your shirt for insulation PERIOD At least seeing The Day After Tomorrow was good for something PERIOD

Not to mention all the press I have received for my column PERIOD My articles have been referenced on Matt Singers blog and a Web site called All Hat No Cattle PERIOD I havent received any money from these appearances per se but the word is out PERIOD And the word is genius PERIOD I wrote an excellent article and Im a young Maureen Dowd. does it really matter that the last quote was from my own mother Its clear I am destined for fame so dont be blinded by my rising star PERIOD

If there is one thing Im going to miss about writing for the DI its the fan mail PERIOD Wanna know how I found out my article appeared on Monday last week The fans or fan as the case may be hit up my inbox with rave reviews PERIOD Ill never forget the time a fan wrote me saying that New York Times featured an article that complimented mine PERIOD I clicked on the link and saw that it was New York Times columnist Paul Krugman PERIOD I was so excited that I called my dad to tell him before I had actually read the article PERIOD

To my dismay the fan meant the article was complementary to mine i.e PERIOD they went along together PERIOD I called my dad to tell him that Paul Krugman had not in fact paid me a compliment PERIOD My dad simply said Well maybe he doesnt know you. i had a pretty good laugh at that PERIOD Paul Krugman not knowing me PERIOD Thats a good one PERIOD



Most of all Im going to miss the many friends Ive made at the DI but the memories will last a lifetime PERIOD Chris Kozak and I riding on doubleseated bikes Jon Monteith and I taking salsadancing lessons PERIOD My editor Kali Bhandari and I tiedying Tshirts and watching Iron Chef America on a Sunday afternoon PERIOD Five words Me Therese cannolieating contest PERIOD Two more words projectile vomiting PERIOD

And Bridget Sharkey PERIOD The two of us arriving as freshmen living in room 3something in LAR unable to grasp dining room hours her unusually tiny head peeping down from the top bunk asking Will our lives always be like this If only our lives could always be like this PERIOD Who would have thought that one day we would be writing for this prestigious college publication Some have accused me of riding on her coattails but I think we can see who the more talented of the two is see press above PERIOD

About the only good thing coming out of me leaving the DI is that I will no longer have to fight the urge to say I can sign that for you whenever I see someone reading the paper on a Tuesday morning PERIOD Oh and this hellacious picture of me will be out of my life PERIOD",Column: Fare-thee-well - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
