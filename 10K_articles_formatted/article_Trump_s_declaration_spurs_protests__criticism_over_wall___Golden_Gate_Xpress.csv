1482,2023-11-04,"protesters swarmed around the San Francisco Federal Building Monday to denounce President Donald Trumps declaration of a national emergency to fund his proposed wall on the U.S.Mexico border PERIOD

The rally was cohosted by Move On and Indivisible SF two social justice organizations that encouraged attendees to write to Congress to end what they are calling a fake national emergency according to Steve Rapport a member of Indivisible SFs steering committee PERIOD

Its quite clear that there is no national emergency at the border Rapport said PERIOD Its also quite clear that the people of the United States voted in November in massive numbers that we didnt want a wall the Congress voted not to fund the wall. rapport said the democratic process does not involve the president making authoritative decisions onhis own PERIOD

Since Trumps election Not My Presidents Day became the new name for Presidents Day at these gatherings according to Rapport PERIOD

Rapport said he hoped people left the protest feeling empowered to pressure members of Congress to pass legislation to override the presidents Jan  PERIOD declaration PERIOD

Many protestors carried signs decrying the wall and some wore pink cateared hats reminiscent of the first postTrump Womens March in  PERIOD

Among them was Neal Allen newly engaged to Anne Lamott New York Times bestselling author and political activist PERIOD

Were getting married in two months so obviously we have other things to do Allen said PERIOD Nothing is more important than democracy. lamott said attending rallies gives her hope PERIOD She attends them out of love for the misrepresented and the environment in protest of the laws that seek to destroy them PERIOD

We just have to take some action Lamott said PERIOD Its not helpful to stay at home and watch TV and be infuriated and grieve. lamott said its important to rile the masses and include all ages PERIOD She said all she wants for her 9yearold grandson is clean air democracy and an upheld
Constitution PERIOD

Kerianne Steele brought her 4yearold boy to the rally to teach him the importance of speaking up for the underrepresented PERIOD

I am concerned that the president is declaring a false state of emergency to continue to stoke the flames of racism Steele said PERIOD

Steele said this was the beginning of a fascist state that eerily resembles Nazi Germany which is why she said it was important
to be alert now PERIOD

Barry Thornton representing the organization Refuse Fascism handed out literature under a giant banner that read Trump and Pence Must Go. thornton said the Trump administration and a large portion of the Supreme Court make up a fascist regime PERIOD He said the administration is trying to consolidate power and millions need to mobilize before they succeed PERIOD

The state of emergency itself is very ominous Thornton said PERIOD

This is how fascist regimes have consolidated power through states of emergency. thornton was glad to see hundreds of people out but said there needs to be thousands PERIOD

Magick Altman closed the protest and said Trump is not the problem but the system that allows him to have power is PERIOD

Mother nature has no borders and no walls Altman said PERIOD
