Heres an old joke What do you call someone who only speaks one language Answer American. like most jokes it has some truth but is terribly reductive PERIOD The more accurate answer is a nativeEnglish speaker. in reality the U.K. Ireland the U.S PERIOD and Australia all have low levels of bilingualism compared to continental Europe additionally whats the most commonly learned secondlanguage in continental Europe English PERIOD

Of course this learning of English is not due to some great desire to learn another tongue  its fueled by necessity as English is the worlds lingua franca from science to technology business diplomacy and popular culture PERIOD Of course the people who look to disparage the U.S PERIOD never point to this fact PERIOD They simply want to create the image of the enlightened European against the ignorant American PERIOD Any educated person knows that ignorance exists within all cultures and that any story or comparison largely relies on where the writer decides to shine their flashlight PERIOD

While there are many cognitive benefits of being bilingual I dont think its a necessary stepping stone in a liberal education PERIOD In fact recent studies show that bilingualism has both benefits and some minor detriments e.g PERIOD worse assessment of performance PERIOD These results are far from definitive since this research area is still inchoate still its gaining increased attention and provides food for thought PERIOD



However as we all know foreign language was either a requirement in high school or is a requirement in college PERIOD For many doctorate programs proficiency in a foreign language is required PERIOD If youre lucky you started taking Spanish in elementary school and were able to develop a strong foundation at a young age PERIOD But that doesnt matter for many doctorate programs that require proficiency in Latin Greek French or German PERIOD Hopefully learning one foreign language will make the acquisition of a second foreign language more intuitive PERIOD Count your blessings if you had educated parents who enrolled you in afterschool French lessons because they knew it would come in handy should you pursue an academic career PERIOD

But why is proficiency in a second language considered more valuable than mastery in a single language Of course some people have a knack for languages PERIOD Folks who specialize in linguistics or philology and translate texts have a mastery of multiple languages PERIOD But is this necessary throughout the social sciences and humanities Is this not akin to requiring one to be proficient in at least one musical instrument While multiple talents are certainly impressive I dont believe that an excellent historian statistician or sociologist needs to display fluency in a second language to fully achieve their academic goals PERIOD

Im not arguing for philistinism or ignorance studying the etymology of English words often points the learner to other languages PERIOD Studying another culture in depth certainly should be a prerequisite for a wellrounded education but I dont think fluency in another language is a fair standard for everyone especially when so many people forget the foreign language theyve learned once theyve finished school PERIOD

A better approach is to make foreign language an option in a dualtrack sequence PERIOD For example a student could choose between either studying the French language or French culture history and norms PERIOD There would of course be some intermingling due to the necessity of understanding one to learn the other PERIOD However the first track would be the same as it currently is focusing on speaking listening reading and writing skills with a bit of culture mixed in while the second would focus on the societys culture history and norms and how these influence its social structure and values in government education familylife etc. with a bit of language mixed in PERIOD

This system would allow students to better explore their interests PERIOD While it may be tough for an English speaker to find the motivation to become fluent in another language when English is so ubiquitous any liberally educated person should be able to find the motivation to learn about how another culture ticks PERIOD Sure fluency is required if one hopes to live and breathe another culture assuming complete fluency is possible without growing up in multiple cultures but this desire shouldnt be forced PERIOD Expanding options makes education more inclusive and doesnt discriminate against students who are only offered the chance to take a foreign language later in life PERIOD
