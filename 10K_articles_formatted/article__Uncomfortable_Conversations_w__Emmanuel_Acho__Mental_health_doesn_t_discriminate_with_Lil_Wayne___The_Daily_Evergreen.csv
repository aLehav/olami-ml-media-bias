On Jan PERIOD  WSU hosted a seminar and workshop for the MLK Programs screening of Uncomfortable Conversations w Emmanuel Acho Mental Health doesnt discriminate w Lil Wayne. after the viewing attendees actively discussed their thoughts on mental health and how to destigmatize getting help PERIOD

When Lil Wayne was around tenyears old his mental health issues started to take shape PERIOD Wayne said he realized it was serious when his thoughts got radical. at the age of  he felt frustrated with not being listened to by his mother PERIOD As a result Wayne told Acho he lacked a place to vent and adequate support to pursue his dreams PERIOD

How I knew I had mental health problems was I pulled the trigger Wayne said PERIOD

Wayne said he ended up in the hospital with a selfinflicted gunshot wound to the chest saved by one police officer who Wayne called Uncle Bob PERIOD

When he got to the top of the steps and saw me there he refused to even step over me Wayne said PERIOD

Officers scoured the apartment while Wayne remained on the floor severely injured PERIOD As he lay there Wayne heard one of the officers yell about finding drugs PERIOD

Thats when Uncle Bob went crazy Wayne said PERIOD and he was like I dont give a fuck about no drugs PERIOD Do you not see the baby on the ground

Uncle Bob ushered other officers to help him get Wayne to the hospital reassuring him that he wasnt going to die PERIOD On the way Wayne repeatedly told Uncle Bob that he wasnt a baby PERIOD

I met him years later Wayne said. but he was like I dont want nothing I just want to say Im happy to see that I saved a life that mattered. yadira Paredes Director of the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation found it interesting and also concerning that mental health was already affecting such a young child PERIOD

It was cute that he was trying to fight him saying he wasnt a baby but they are Paredes said PERIOD They really are These kids are so little and to know that things like that can start that young. moderator Charles Allen Ross opened the Zoomworkshop for comments participation flooded in PERIOD Dozens of attendees from across the WSU system chimed in to add to the discussion allowing the workshop to be an open and honest conversation on mental health PERIOD

The more that we can normalize the idea that is going to therapy or going to seek a doctor about something that your health is suffering from said Chris Cordodor Customer Relationship ManagementTechnology project manager.The more that that stigma can go away. various people spoke on their own mental health and why changing the image of therapy or assistance is important PERIOD

Paredes said she thinks its up to us to break those stigmas to break those chains to break those tales and those myths PERIOD

Waynes mental health is doing much betteraccording to the video his mental health issues did not go away but simply changed due to his maturity PERIOD He said they hit differently hit harder but being real about struggles that are going on and being honest about feelings are the first steps to working coping mechanisms that actually help PERIOD
