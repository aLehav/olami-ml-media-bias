As an avid television viewer I get a little too attached to my shows and therefore TV networks always have the ability to break my heart PERIOD For instance ABC canceled three of my favorite shows in the same news release and I havent really gotten over it yet PERIOD And I do not even work in the industry PERIOD So I cannot even imagine how Conan OBrien feels PERIOD

Most of you have heard about the ConanLeno controversy but heres a quick recap PERIOD In  NBC decided that Conan would take over The Tonight Show in  when Jay Leno would retire PERIOD But  rolled around and Leno had changed his mind PERIOD NBC gave Leno the  p.m PERIOD time slot to host The Jay Leno Show five nights a week instead of five hours of NBCs primetime programming PERIOD This plan did not work out too well PERIOD Although Lenos new show was fairly inexpensive to produce it got terrible ratings and no one was watching the  p.m PERIOD news on NBC PERIOD Not that The Tonight Show was doing much better in the ratings PERIOD Still The Jay Leno Show was recently canceled PERIOD

The original plan was to put Leno back on at  p.m PERIOD and Conan on at  a.m PERIOD The Tonight Show however has been on at  since its inception PERIOD And since OBrien has a respect for its history he refused to push The Tonight Show back a half hour PERIOD Once Conan rejected their plan NBC essentially forced Conan off the air after seven months without giving his new show a chance PERIOD

Conans show has been extremely funny since this whole controversy began PERIOD Conan kept silent for a long time after the news about Leno broke but opened up to his viewers with the greeting Hi Im Conan OBrien and I soon may be available for childrens birthday parties. conan lost his NBC home PERIOD It would be like if my parents kicked me out of the house because they wanted to convert my room into a home office PERIOD Conan has been on NBC for longer than Ive been alive so the metaphor sort of works PERIOD I would be pretty bitter about it too but unlike Conan I wouldnt be able to convert my anger into scathing humor PERIOD

The last Tonight Show with Conan OBrien aired on Friday and in the last two nights Conan pulled out all the stops to make the funniest show possible PERIOD Until the end of the week he was on NBCs dime and made some crazy purchases like the rights to The Rolling Stones Satisfaction Kentucky Derby winner Mine That Bird and an original Picasso PERIOD None of these purchases was real surprisingly but they were pretty funny to watch PERIOD He also cut together some highlights from the past seven months asked to be played in a movie by lookalike Tilda Swinton and joked about the possible better uses for his soontobe empty studio most notably to leave the studio cold and empty and rename it The Worlds Largest Metaphor for NBC Programming. the final show included appearances by Steve Carell Tom Hanks and Neil Young but the real highlight occurred near the end of the hour PERIOD Conan strangely enough took the time to thank NBC for all the opportunities they have given him PERIOD He also thanked his fans for all the support they have given to turn the terrible situation into something joyous and inspirational. warning young people against cynicism he asks his viewers not to give up hope and to follow their dreams just like he did to get to The Tonight Show in the first place PERIOD Finishing out the show by jamming on an electric guitar with Will Ferrell Max Weinberg and the rest of the Tonight Show Band it was joyous incredibly sincere and just sweet PERIOD I for one really hope Conan can find a new home on latenight extremely soon PERIOD
