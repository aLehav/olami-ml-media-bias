Backpedaling past midcourt with eight minutes to play in the second half Mike Walker and Ben Luber looked at each other and smiled as a whistle blew for a Northwestern timeout PERIOD

Luber had just fed Walker for a 3pointer for the second time in  seconds and Penn States guards had just extended the Nittany Lions lead to  which would prove more than enough to tame the Wildcats on Saturday PERIOD

Penn States three guards  Luber Walker and David Jackson  combined for  points and  assists in the  win over the Wildcats PERIOD The trio was able to exploit Northwesterns  zone shooting  from the field and  from beyond the arc PERIOD

The performance was extra meaningful for Luber who could use the confidence booster after making a poor decision at the end of Wednesdays loss at Indiana PERIOD

 teammate Travis Parker said PERIOD 

Luber enjoyed success against the Wildcats on Jan PERIOD  when he tallied  points  in the second half PERIOD The junior finished Saturday with nine points and five assists PERIOD

Penn State is  when Luber records eight points or more PERIOD

 Northwestern coach Bill Carmody said PERIOD 

The point guard was even able to convert on a fast break layup attempt something that has proven much easier said than done for Luber this season PERIOD

 Penn State coach Ed DeChellis said PERIOD 

Jackson who turned his ankle midway through the second half against Northwestern is averaging nine points over the past three games PERIOD The Lions are  when Jackson scores at least nine PERIOD

Walker who has attempted only  2point shots this year also converted on a fast break layup with  to go PERIOD Making the play more impressive was that Walker grabbed the rebound on defense to start the break was fouled on the attempt and then sank the free throw PERIOD

The Lions will need their guards to continue playing well if the team is to make a run in the Big Ten tournament late next week PERIOD

While the backcourt normally does not produce many points for Penn State an understanding of how to share and protect the ball has contributed to the teams success in recent weeks PERIOD

The guards need not take over the game for Penn State to find success  thats what Parker and Geary Claxton are there for PERIOD

 Carmody said of the Lions PERIOD
