Im sure that any student that has attended Southeastern recently knows of the various religious groups that set up shop in the War Memorial Student union area PERIOD They are allowed to proclaim their ideals and beliefs through the freedom of speech given by the First Amendment PERIOD

As a veteran of our Nations great military and a proud supporter of free speech I do not wish for the removal of such persons because of their particular views or belief systems PERIOD However since the Student Union is a War Memorial the area surrounding our U.S PERIOD flag should be a place of peace and not the stage for controversial and heated debates concerning who or what is right or wrong PERIOD It is utterly disrespectful towards those who have lost loved ones or served in wars past and present PERIOD On behalf of the majority of SLU students I sincerely request a change of location to be offered to those individuals and groups that wish to visit our campus for the purpose of religious debate PERIOD
