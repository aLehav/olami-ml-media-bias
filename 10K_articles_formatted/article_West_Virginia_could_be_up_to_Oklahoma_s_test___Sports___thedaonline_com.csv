It wasnt pretty but after West Virginia managed to prove itself again Saturday the momentum gained each week has given fans a reason to be confident entering Week  of the season PERIOD

Though the next opponent for WVU will bring challenges they havent had to face yet in No PERIOD  Oklahoma PERIOD While it will be a tough test West Virginia will certainly have a chance to knock off the visiting Sooners PERIOD

I say this for two key reasons PERIOD

One reason Clint Trickett PERIOD The redshirt senior quarterback has been phenomenal this season to say the least PERIOD

In all three of the Mountaineers games this season Trickett has put up at least  yards on at least  completions per game and is currently third in the nation in overall passing yards through the first three games PERIOD

In addition to that hes coming off a careerhigh  yard passing game the second most in WVU history and thats a statistic that only former Mountaineer and current New York Jets quarterback Geno Smith who threw  yards during a game in  PERIOD

The doubts I had with Trickett leading West Virginia to any sort of success this season prior to Week  were numerous PERIOD

Between his offseason shoulder surgery and not being hit one single time before the ChickfilA Kickoff Game to his lack of overall leadership in  I had little confidence in his abilities heading into this year PERIOD

He has ended up proving me wrong on nearly every level with only suffering a couple of somewhat bad hits thus far PERIOD He is playing like a quarterback that has been able to demonstrate extensive leadership both on and off the field PERIOD

My second key entering Week  for West Virginia is the running game PERIOD

There have been moments when its not just Pitt transfer Rushel Shell and Wendell Smallwood lighting it up from the back field but also Andrew Buie Dustin Garrison and Dreamius Smith who are also contributing to the Mountaineer offensive game as the quintuple have collectively racked up  yards over the first three games PERIOD

However there are times when the potential that I know is there for this running group simply comes up short and has really become a huge difference maker on some of WVUs  plays this season PERIOD

As the Mountaineers will be going up against a Sooner defense that is averaging giving up  points per game and a total of  rushing yards against them this season utilizing the running game to the fullest in connection with Trickett and his options in the passing game will be huge in order for WVU to have any shot at a victory Saturday PERIOD

Just a few practices remain until we will all once again see just how far this team can be stretched PERIOD

However if West Virginia can stay somewhat consistent against one of the top teams in the nation as they did with thenNo PERIOD  Alabama in Week  then Mountaineer Nation may be in for yet another good ball game under the lights at Milan Puskar Stadium Saturday PERIOD
