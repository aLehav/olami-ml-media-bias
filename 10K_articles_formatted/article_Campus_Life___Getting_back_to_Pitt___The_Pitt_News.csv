Coming to Pitt after a nice relaxing summer is both exciting and nerve wracking PERIOD If you took the summer to relax and travel coming back to school with the thought of doing work and going to class is not the best feeling PERIOD There are so many things to do around Pittsburgh and even in your dorm or apartment that can help with that uneasy feeling and make it a smoother transition PERIOD

As a junior I think I have a routine down that effectively works for me.The first thing I did when I moved back onto campus was make sure my apartment was clean and decorated to how I wanted it PERIOD Since I was not on campus all summer my apartment needed to be vacuumed and dusted as soon as possible so that was the first thing I took care of PERIOD Also because this is a new school year I wanted to change things up around my room so I decided to take my roommates help and rearrange my room and put up new decorations around the apartment PERIOD I havent seen my roommate all summer so this was a great way to bond again and catch up on our summers PERIOD We realized how much of each others lives we missed out on and could not wait to make more memories this year PERIOD

One thing I really wanted to do before this semester started was find a new study spot PERIOD My favorite places are Hillman and Cathy but I realized I needed a new place PERIOD I walked around campus for a bit after we got situated and found good spots in Posvar and Mervis PERIOD Both areas had nice desks and were quiet which is how I am the most productive PERIOD

My roommate and I went grocery shopping the day we got back so that we were stocked up on meals and snacks for the next few weeks PERIOD We did this right away because we knew that once classes started we would not have the time to go grocery shopping and properly clean the apartment during the week PERIOD Our favorite places to get groceries are Trader Joes on Penn Avenue which is only a short bus ride away and Whole Foods also on Penn Avenue PERIOD

Another thing I love doing is catching up with friends that I have not seen all summer PERIOD I was able to see a few of my friends this past summer since they live close to me but the majority of them were in Pittsburgh working PERIOD Seeing everyone after a long  months was exactly what I needed while moving back in because it felt like home again PERIOD We all made sure to grab dinner and catch up that day which was an amazing feeling PERIOD

Since this is a new semester and my schedule is very different from last year I had to establish a new routine for myself PERIOD Last semester I would wake up and go straight to the gym to get a workout in PERIOD However this semester I decided to schedule my classes earlier in the day so that my afternoon and evening would be more free for studying and hanging out with friends PERIOD I no longer have the time to go to the gym super early in the morning unless I wake up around  a.m. but that would leave me feeling exhausted for the rest of the day PERIOD I decided it might be a better idea to start going before dinner time around  p.m PERIOD This also worked out for my roommate and we both now go together around that time PERIOD We then come home and make dinner together while watching a show on Netflix PERIOD This routine has already helped us both so much in being productive and motivated as it is only the second week of this semester PERIOD

Since I moved back onto campus a few days before classes started I had a lot of time to get situated in the apartment PERIOD I also made sure to mentally prepare myself for classes and bought the textbooks I needed for them PERIOD Once I was comfortable in Oakland again my roommate and I went to our favorite sunset spot which is in Schenley Park and ate dinner there one night PERIOD We used to do this during our freshman and sophomore years here and it brought back so many memories PERIOD This helped us destress before classes and we felt much more relaxed before classes started PERIOD

Overall transitioning to college after a long summer is sometimes hard and frustrating but Pittsburgh has so many things you can do that can help with the moving process PERIOD
