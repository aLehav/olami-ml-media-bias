Over the course of this year  as the vaccine has become readily available in the United States to those who want it and daily cases and deaths resulting from COVID19 have sharply declined  the national conversation has largely centered on what the new normal might look like PERIOD Some want to immediately return to life exactly as it was before the pandemic while others believe that we must continue to take the virus into consideration until a greater percentage of the population gets vaccinated PERIOD In light of this contentious issue many shows have incorporated their visions of postoutbreak life PERIOD

That said the portrayal of the new normal presented by Curb Your Enthusiasm seems very familiar PERIOD The season  premiere of Larry Davids classic series features the same wellcrafted comedic story structure that fans of the series know and love as multiple threads all come together by the end of the 40minute run time PERIOD

Larry Larry David Saturday Night Live wakes up in the middle of the night to find a dead man in his swimming pool PERIOD The next day he and his manager Jeff Jeff Garlin The Goldbergs successfully pitch a TV show loosely based on Larrys young adulthood aptly titled Young Larry to Netflix PERIOD However the dead mans brother Marcos Marques Ray Brews Brothers extorts Larry threatening to pursue a legal battle unless Larry hires his talentless daughter Maria Sofia Keyla Monterroso Mejia On My Block on Young Larry. other intertwining plot lines include the aliveandwell Albert Brooks The Simpsons hosting his own funeral and a financial quarrel between Larry and Dennis John Pirruccello Godzilla vs PERIOD Kong a rude man with earlyonset dementia PERIOD

This episode of Curb succeeds on multiple fronts PERIOD The impressive selection of guest stars including Brooks Pirruccello Jon Hamm Mad Men and Lucy Liu Elementary all shine demonstrating the eagerness of actors to perform alongside the legendary Larry David PERIOD The season arc of Young Larry is promising and reminiscent of the Seinfeld season four showwithinashow arc which David devised with Jerry Seinfeld nearly  years ago PERIOD However the blackmail situation is hard to believe why would anyone succumb to such absurd extortion

Nevertheless with a clear season arc in place as well as all the other elements of a typical Curb episode there is one factor that is conspicuously lacking references to COVID19 PERIOD There is no presentation or even discussion of life during the pandemic and very little to indicate a distinctly postpandemic state there are no masks in sight and no social distancing PERIOD Larry David has made a concerted effort to ignore the subject of COVID19 altogether PERIOD

We dont see any gags about Larry enjoying his time away from society during the lockdown but we do see him struggle to win back his girlfriend Liu after he bangs his head into a glass door causing her to lose her attraction to him PERIOD There are no conflicts between Jeff and his shorttempered wife Susie Susie Essman Bless This Mess after being stuck alone together for months but he does secretly confide in Larry that he was correct in an argument with Susie PERIOD

The only joke related to COVID19 in the entire episode is when Larry discovers that Albert Brooks is a COVID hoarder promptly causing every guest to curse out Brooks and storm out PERIOD What point is David trying to make about people here What does it say about them if they would happily indulge a man who is so egotistical that he wants to hear people praise him at his own funeral but instantly hate him upon learning that he purchased too many sanitary supplies during the pandemic

Davids intention was probably not to put forth some grand revelation about American behavior or attitudes PERIOD That has never been his style PERIOD However we can safely assume that he is pushing back against the idea that COVID19 must always be the center of discussion the endallbeall issue PERIOD He utilized a similar comedic strategy to address the controversial Donald Trump in 2020s season  premiere PERIOD None of the jokes in the episode dealt with politics but instead made light of the M.A.G.A PERIOD hat as a social deterrent PERIOD

Just like Trump did throughout his presidency the pandemic has dominated headlines and the media for over a year and a half PERIOD No matter where you stand on any of the numerous debates surrounding COVID19 you are sure to get triggered after a twominute scroll through Twitter PERIOD We could all use a break PERIOD David is happy to indulge us PERIOD
