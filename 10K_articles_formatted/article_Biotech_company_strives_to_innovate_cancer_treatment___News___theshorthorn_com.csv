AbeXXa Biologics employee Rachel Medal examines six different types of cancer cell lines on a plate June  at the Shimadzu Institute for Research Technologies in theNanofab Center.Medal said she ensures the cancer cell lines are healthy enough to be harvested PERIOD

AbeXXa Biologics is now ranked among the  Best University Startups  PERIOD

The list was compiled by the National Council of Entrepreneurial Tech Transfer which searches for university startups created by students faculty staff and alumni PERIOD AbeXXa Biologics ranking recognizes the startups effort to create something new said Jon Weidanz company cofounder and chief scientist PERIOD

AbeXXa has actually developed the capabilities to identify targets on cancer cells that we then build drugs against he said PERIOD

The exact targets are something he could not discuss because provisional patents are still being filed he said PERIOD

With three other university startups under his belt Weidanz is a trained immunologist a biology professor and the associate vice president for research at UTA PERIOD Though he is not currently teaching Weidanz said he has administrative duties for the research program which take up much of his time PERIOD

Now the challenge is how do I keep my academic professor lab going because I still enjoy doing that he said PERIOD Its getting harder because the administrative role takes time and the company takes time. to maintain the company a staff of Ph.D.level scientists work on the research alongside professionals who help with accounting and financial duties he said PERIOD Also graduates from UTMD Anderson Cancer Center UTSouthwestern and Baylor University are involved with the company PERIOD

I cant lose sight of the fact that I cant spend that much time on the company he said PERIOD Thats why I hired all these good scientists PERIOD Scientists who are leaders who can run teams and report to me in the evenings or on the weekends. the company recently opened a research lab called LabCentral near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge Massachusetts Weidanz said PERIOD AbeXXa leases out the space but after winning an award the startup earned a golden ticket to be rentfree for a year PERIOD

They say thats the most soughtout zip code in the U.S PERIOD if youre a biotech company he said PERIOD

Many local companies vied for the space so a Texas company making it in the northeast is special Weidanz said.Not only does its exposure to the area help UTA but it also allows Weidanz to meet with groups who could be interested in the universitys research including drug companies and other biotech companies PERIOD

Its not just AbeXXa he said PERIOD I also wear my UTA hat too PERIOD Its kind of fun PERIOD Im sort of a scout in that regard. susanne Gimlin AbeXXas vice president of operations started working with the company through her friend of  years cofounder Debra Weidanz PERIOD They worked together at another small company on campus Resonant Sensors doing research and building up the companys commercial products she said PERIOD

Gimlin said working at both Resonant Sensors and AbeXXa is fun because their work is complementary PERIOD

The goal for AbeXXa is more of a longterm mission she said PERIOD

My main goal is to see a drug therapeutic candidate or an antibody therapeutic candidate all the way through to the market she said PERIOD

To make that dream a reality Gimlin manages the logistics ensuring scientists have the laboratory space and necessary equipment they need while maintaining good relationships with vendors PERIOD

She said her work with small companies has shown her how much is involved on the business side such as employee benefits insurance policies and payroll PERIOD

The possibilities for AbeXXaare exciting she said PERIOD

What were doing here in the long run is going to benefit so many people Gimlin said PERIOD Its something that could be very lifechanging for individuals were developing therapeutics for. before working for AbeXXa principal scientist Hemanta Baruah worked for a company that specializes in discovering antibodies for human therapeutic purposes he said PERIOD

After his postdoctoral training at MIT Baruah worked for eight years in New Hampshire before moving to Texas to work for AbeXXa.He said speaking with Jon Weidanz encouraged the move because he could see the companys potential PERIOD

I thought I could make a difference here he said PERIOD Thats why I came here. in the biologics field Baruah said developing antibodies for serious diseases like cancer is a popular practice PERIOD

Its a hot field Baruah said PERIOD Its a proven technology right now. abeXXas ability to target one thing gives it an advantage over other drugs he said.With a specific target AbeXXa can reduce the bodys toxicity a technology seldomly used in the industry PERIOD

For example Baruah said chemotherapy doesnt have a specific target so it not only kills cancerous cells but healthy ones too PERIOD

If we are successful in the targets and were seeing positive results right now thatll be a very niche field for us he said PERIOD It will make AbeXXa very very valuable. chanelsassoon
