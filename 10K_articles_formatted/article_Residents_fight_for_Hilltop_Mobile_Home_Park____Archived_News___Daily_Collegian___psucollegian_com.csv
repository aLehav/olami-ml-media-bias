Living in the Hilltop Mobile Home Park for  years is one of the only constants Ronald Young has ever known PERIOD

But in less than three months Young along with the other residents of Hilltop could be forced to leave his home behind PERIOD

Matthew Rooke a spokesperson for the Hilltop Residence Association said residents must leave by February  after the owners of the park chose to sell it to developers PERIOD

Because of this community members spoke at the College Township council meeting last night to ask the council to give their support that the land remain zoned as a mobile home park PERIOD

College Township council member Daniel Klees said the Hilltop Mobile Home Parks area is currently zoned for mobile home parks and said the developers who purchased the land want to rezone it PERIOD

 Rooke said PERIOD 

Klees said community members and residents from the park wrote in letters to the council asking them to vote against the rezoning of the area PERIOD

Klees said many peoples letters focused on the nonrezoning as well as asking what the council could do to give the tenants more time to give a counter offer for the land in lieu of the other company PERIOD

He said in other states there are examples of a cooperative purchase by the owners of the mobile homes so it becomes a tenant owned property and said this is probably the model many letterwriters were following PERIOD

However Klees said the closing of this park has also highlighted the need for affordable housing in the Centre County region PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

Klees said there is competition between student renters and the local worker renters and said realtors are probably able to charge students more than someone who works at a lower income job PERIOD

Robert Morris a resident of College Township said he wrote in a letter to the council regarding the closing of the park PERIOD

He said he had a friend who lived in the park and said he hopes the town will be able to come together to find a solution for the residents PERIOD

 Morris said PERIOD
