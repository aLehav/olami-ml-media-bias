Peter Salk knows the last step to eradicating polio teamwork PERIOD

His father Jonas Salk the inventor of the injected polio vaccine began imagining an institute dedicated to investigating experimental medicine in  two years after the creation of the first

polio vaccine in  PERIOD Jonas founded the Jonas Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California in  PERIOD

But according to the younger Salk his father knew more than research would be necessary to eradicate the virus PERIOD

Cooperation brings us results PERIOD But he knew we have to deal with the issues that arise from mans relationship to man Salk said PERIOD

Salk spoke to  students medical professionals and Pittsburghers about achieving polio eradication as part of the series Food for Thought a talk the University of Pittsburghs Graduate School of Public Health sponsored Wednesday evening PERIOD

According to Caitlin McCullough events coordinator for Student Affairs the series provides reallife application of theories that students in Pitts medical school learn in class by providing historical context to relevant issues of public health PERIOD

The eradication of polio is still a goal of ours as a society and planet McCullough said PERIOD Although its not as prevalent the plight of one disease is relevant no matter what. during the event Salk presented the plight and prevalence of poliovirus ending with the challenges that keep eradication a goal rather than a reality such as lack of education and cultural barriers PERIOD

Weve muddled through using two imperfect vaccines in harmony to reach near eradication Salk said PERIOD Whats missing now is the political religious cultural dimension that will allow us to accomplish eradication in a smooth fashion. cindy Bryce associate dean of Student Affairs said Peter Salk spoke as a visiting professor in the department of infectious diseases and microbiology at Pitt PERIOD Salk currently works in San Diego as president of the Jonas Salk Legacy Foundation PERIOD

We wanted to bring him back to talk about disease that is still important which we take for granted as cured but isnt Bryce said PERIOD

Peoples desire to eradicate lost momentum the year the vaccine came into use after the Cutter Incident in which more than  US children received a incompletely inactivated polio vaccine PERIOD The injected polio vaccine is produced from naturally occurring poliovirus strains killed by formalin a mixture of formaldehyde and water PERIOD Two hundred children were paralyzed in varying degrees PERIOD

Pushback continued into the turn of the century and spread globally to areas opposed to Westernization and medical intervention PERIOD

The consequences of denying vaccines to certain populations are widespread PERIOD One fifth of the worlds polio cases in  occurred in the Shigal District of Afghanistan which has a population of  people PERIOD According to Salk from these unvaccinated areas the virus spread through sewage to Israel PERIOD

We are dealing with a world that has a great deal of complexity and misunderstanding of vaccines Salk said PERIOD

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention polio was eradicated in the United States in  PERIOD As of the end of last year only  cases remain worldwide PERIOD

Margaret Matthews an epidemiology graduate student in the school of public health who grew up in Rochester New York and received her undergraduate degree from Mercyhurst University in Erie Pennsylvania wasnt born the last time polio was prevalent in the United States PERIOD

I didnt realize the polio virus research started in Pittsburgh or that first trials happened here Matthews said at the lecture PERIOD It makes it really relatable. according to Salk eradicating polio requires transition from the oral vaccine back to the injected vaccine which has  percent effectiveness after three doses PERIOD Albert Sabin created the oral polio vaccine in  PERIOD The treatment contains weakened poliovirus not the inactivated virus like the injectable vaccine PERIOD

Beyond transitioning from the viral makeup of the vaccine is the transition in medical technology PERIOD At the end of the lecture Peter Salk introduced a less painful patch of microneedles that replace the need for a vile of vaccination and syringe PERIOD

This new medical technology contains the vaccine in a solid form which is left on for a few minutes and dissolves into the skin Salk said PERIOD

Bryce said having Peter Salk talk at the University about his firsthand experience with the disease  from witnessing the invention of the vaccine to the research he is doing now  was a rare and insightful experience PERIOD

We learn about this from textbooks and he tells us as part of his life Bryce said PERIOD Students are better able to understand and appreciate history when they can put faces to names. created by our advertising software OpenX PERIOD
