Midway through an interview with David Yost after practice last week my phone rang twice PERIOD It was the Philadelphia Eagles media relations team with Chase Daniel Yosts former quarterback at Missouri PERIOD

Yost asked if it was Daniel on the line and if he could catch up with him briefly PERIOD I threw the phone on speaker and listened in PERIOD

Chase PERIOD Its Yost Oregons quarterback coach said enthusiastically PERIOD

The two talked for about a minute and it was almost as if theywere back on the field at Missouri talking about small things with an instant rapport PERIOD Daniel later texted him that he was surprised to talk with Yost randomly after a Thursday practice PERIOD

Yost who the Ducks hired in January has been instrumental in helping Oregons true freshman quarterback Justin Herbert develop at the Division I level PERIOD Yost brings a wealth of experience and the ability to develop offensive leaders something Daniel said dates back to their time together PERIOD

He coaches to your strengths said Daniel a Heisman Trophy finalist at Missouri PERIOD Not a lot of quarterback coaches are willing to do that PERIOD Theyre stuck in their ways PERIOD He has so many ways he can do it and motivate guys. oregon head coach Mark Helfrich said hes picked up on Yosts ability to connect with former players be it Daniel or others PERIOD

Guys are always keeping in contact with him from a long way back he said PERIOD Its been the Blaine Gabberts the Brad Smiths as much as its been the guy from Akron from way back when PERIOD All of those relationships are important. oregon quarterbacks coach David Yost speaks at a media availability outside the HatfieldDowlin Complex in Eugene Oregon on Sept PERIOD   PERIOD Adam EberhardtEmerald

His track record with quarterbacks runs deep PERIOD He tutored Brad Smith who became the first quarterback to throw for  yards and run for  in college PERIOD Smith went on to play wide receiver in the NFL for nine seasons PERIOD Yost also worked closely with Blaine Gabbert who started this season for the San Francisco 49ers PERIOD

Yost  escaped the spotlight after  years at Missouri taking a job under Mike Leach at Washington State as the inside receivers coach PERIOD He moved to Pullman Washington in search of a respite from feeling burned out PERIOD He spent three years at WSU but those closest to him knew he had an inkling to coach quarterbacks again PERIOD

He had a good experience with Leach former Missouri coach Gary Pinkel said in a March interview with The RegisterGuard but I knew Dave could not just coach wide receivers PERIOD Theres nothing wrong with that but his passion is coaching quarterbacks. now in Eugene Yost feels like hes found the perfect fit PERIOD With newcomer Justin Herbert the two are working to take Oregon football back into the national conversation PERIOD Yost has arguably one of the nations top young quarterbacks in Herbert who Yost said has an it factor on the field PERIOD

Away from the job hes found the right worklife balance PERIOD Oregons weekly schedule allows him to pick up his kids from school on Thursdays and Fridays PERIOD Hes always home for breakfast too PERIOD At some points this season he said hes had enough time on Saturday mornings before games to hang shelves in his garage PERIOD

Although he feels fortunate for a flexible schedule at Oregon Yost said he enjoysa new challenge in working with the Ducks PERIOD

When this opportunity opened up it was really exciting that I would get to coach the quarterbacks at a school like Oregon Yost said PERIOD

Hes brought some traditions to Oregon that he adopted from Missouri PERIOD Since  the Ducks have established a doughnut Friday tradition but Yost has added his own touch for his players PERIOD Each Friday he brings chocolate chip cookies his wife Carrie and three children make for the Ducks quarterbacks and holders PERIOD Its not uncommon for the cookies to come with personalized messages from Yosts kids such as Go Ducks or Good luck Lockie. at Missouri he brought pizza for Thursday walkthroughs and bags of candy on Friday evenings PERIOD Daniel has fond memories of his favorite candy from his days at Missouri Jolly Rancher chews PERIOD

Its the little things with him Daniel said PERIOD Hes so prepared that theres so many things that could stand out. those around him say he brings the same preparedness to the field PERIOD Offensive line coach Steve Greatwood who has been on Oregons staff for  years said hes never had a quarterbacks coach who spends as much time reviewing protections PERIOD

Hes a real detailed guy in that regard Greatwood said PERIOD I appreciate that because we want to make sure that were on the right page PERIOD  I think its great any time you can bring someone in that has been indoctrinated in other systems. oregon quarterbacks coach David Yost watches as the quarterbacks warm up before the game PERIOD The Oregon Ducks play the Washington State Cougars at Martin Stadium in Pullman Washington on Oct PERIOD   PERIOD Adam EberhardtEmerald

When Ducks quarterback Jeff Lockie first heard of Yosts imminent hire he turned to Google PERIOD He first found David Yost the actor and producer PERIOD But after modifying his search Lockie realized his new position coach boasted long blonde locks which Yost said hes had for years PERIOD He stands out on the recruiting trail with ease and Daniel agreed PERIOD He said Yosts hair first caught his eye when he visited his Dallasarea house on a recruiting trip more than a decade ago PERIOD

Its pretty much a running joke Lockie said PERIOD You can give him a hard time about his hair whenever you want. aside from his eccentric hairstyle Yost has been praised for his attention to detail PERIOD He puts an emphasis on practice video and says Oregons quarterbacks can learn from every snap whether it was productive or not PERIOD

We watch every snap from practice video after every practice Yost said PERIOD Sometimes you have to get through it fast for the time you have but still theres something you can learn from it. between the unconventional hair style knack for recruiting and credentials mentoring quarterbacks Yost stands out in the crowded Division I coaching field PERIOD

I think he constantly sees positive Daniel said PERIOD Thats one thing in this day in age that you dont see a lot of PERIOD  Hes always building you up. follow Jonathan Hawthorne on Twitter JonHawthorne
