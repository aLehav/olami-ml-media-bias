Makayla Hoppe Editor In ChiefJune  

When Who Framed Roger Rabbit was released in  it earned accolades in the world of animation PERIOD Including animation in liveaction footage was undoubtedly not a new concept but including the toons as living breathing characters that could tangibly interact with the natural world had not been successfully done before PERIOD Robert Zemeckis mysterycomedy film changed all that PERIOD

Artists drew directly on the film cells PERIOD They looked at the shadows and light in the liveaction world and applied them to all the animated toons PERIOD For years animated characters floated through the real world never really looking like they belonged PERIOD Roger Rabbit animators made every toons eyeline match with the actors ensuring that the animations were as lifelike as could be PERIOD

Roger Rabbit successfully blended Disney and Looney Tunes characters PERIOD It entertained audiences and left a lasting impression that is still featured in Hollywood PERIOD Some films like SpiderMan No Way Home blew audiences away with their multiverse of franchises while other films like Space Jam A New Legacy left audiences cringing at the number of IPs included PERIOD

Many have said that Who Framed Roger Rabbit should not have a true sequel and while there have been some whispers of it in Hollywood nothing has been done PERIOD Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers may not be that direct sequel but it is certainly an homage PERIOD And it is a welldone entertaining homage PERIOD

A Chip n Dale movie based on their 90s Disney Channel cartoon seems like an odd decision just from a filmmaking perspective PERIOD Its a 30yearold kids cartoon why should this be a feature film However Chip N Dale has again blended toon franchises to the same entertaining effect that Roger Rabbit established PERIOD

The  film is a love letter to Millennials PERIOD It references 90s films and television and todays memes and internetfamous faces PERIOD Remember the ugly uncannyvalley Sonic the Hedgehog from  that the internet collectively chastised Hes a major supporting character PERIOD Disney has somehow accumulated properties from dozens of studios and franchises PERIOD There is even a brief South Park cameo PERIOD Randy Marsh is in a Disney movie PERIOD What timeline are we in

The writing tries a little too hard to give the story a heart and it feels forced toward the end of the film PERIOD However the humor is on point PERIOD The film will leave you laughing with hilarious gags character reveals and witty dialogue PERIOD It is a little surprising seeing as how the trailer didnt do the upcoming film any good PERIOD Once the film was released on Disneys streaming service the internet noticed and word spread quickly The film is funny check it out PERIOD

Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers respects the legacy that Roger Rabbit set before it by including a few little references PERIOD The film is selfaware and does not take itself too seriously PERIOD It may not be as emotionally moving as a Pixar film even though it tries but sometimes all we need is a few hours of fun stupid humor PERIOD As Roger Rabbit himself said But Im a toon PERIOD Toons are supposed to make people laugh. your donation will support the student journalists of Grossmont College PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
