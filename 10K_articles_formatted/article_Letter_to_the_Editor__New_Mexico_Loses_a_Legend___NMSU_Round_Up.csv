William Fulginiti Executive Director New Mexico Municipal League  COURTESY PHOTO

New Mexico lost a giant in public service this week PERIOD Bill Fulginiti director of the Municipal League for more than  years was a big guy whose presence was felt every time he entered a room PERIOD But more significantly his absence will be felt throughout the state PERIOD

Fulginiti who died Wednesday was a recipient of the Governors Distinguished Public Service Award New Mexico Distinguished Public Administration Award Outstanding Young Man of America and New Mexico Library Amigo Award among other honors PERIOD He served two terms on the board of the National League of Cities directed the New Mexico Tax Research Institute was vice chair of the New Mexico Finance Authority and Water Trust Board and served on too many task forces to list PERIOD

He helped launch the New Mexico Self Insurers Fund and the National League of Cities Mutual Insurance Company where he later served as chair and initiated the first bond pool for New Mexico cities to allow them to accessnational bond markets and save money on interest rates PERIOD His more recent work on the state capital outlay process greatly helped reduce the number of idle projects PERIOD

He was according to others who walk the corridors of the Roundhouse a force to be reckoned with whose endorsement or dismissal of a bill could make or break legislation PERIOD But he was also known for his honesty and integrity his willingness to work with newbies to help them understand the process and the policy and the hundreds of meatball subs he and his wife Pat made for legislative staff every session PERIOD

Before Fulginiti New Mexicos municipalities were a quiet voice in the legislative process PERIOD After Fulginiti took over the Municipal League that voice grew to include statutory membership on numerous state boards PERIOD Since  his name has appeared in more than  news articles in theSanta Fe New Mexicanarchives PERIOD

He was to say the least committed not just to the cities and towns he represented but to the people of New Mexico and to public service in general PERIOD Fulginiti recognized that being part of the process mattered whether the participant was an influential organization or an individual PERIOD He advised all New Mexicans to participate good advice no matter who you are or what issues are important to you PERIOD

Go to city hall he once said PERIOD Go to the city council meetings and participate PERIOD You know governance is not just those people sitting on that city council PERIOD Governance is the people working with them together to make it work for their cities. representative Patricia Lundstrom executive director of the Greater Gallup Economic Development Corporation has served in the New Mexico Legislature representing McKinley and San Juan counties since January  PERIOD She is chairwoman of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee and vice chairwoman of the Legislative Finance Committee PERIOD She is also a member of the House Transportation Public Works and Capital Improvements Committee PERIOD
