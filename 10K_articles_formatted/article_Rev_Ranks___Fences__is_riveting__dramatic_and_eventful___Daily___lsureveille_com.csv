The film Fences based on the August Wilson play of the same name has received rave reviews since coming to theaters in December PERIOD

STARS . directed by Denzel Washington and starring Viola Davis and Washington himself the film and its cast have been nominated for a plethora of awards PERIOD Sunday night Viola Davis was awarded a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress following her December Critics Choice Award win PERIOD

Set in 1950s Pittsburg this film tells the story of the fictional Troy Maxson Denzel Washington and the ups and downs of his family life and career PERIOD

Married to Rose Viola Davis and father to Corey Jovan Adepo and Lyons Russell Hornsby Troy was a poor black man who made a little over  a week as a garbage collector PERIOD Maxson once dreamed of becoming a professional baseball player but was fencedout of the league due to his old age PERIOD

Though he was told this was because of his age he believes it was because of the color of his skin PERIOD Bitter and resentful he took out his anger on Corey who dreamed of being in the NFL PERIOD Because of this he and Corey butt heads throughout the film and the audience is able to see Troys true colors PERIOD

The New York Times stated What is most remarkable about this film is how thoroughly  how painfully how honestly how beautifully  it answers the question What about my life

There was one scene in the movie that truly touched me when Corey asked his father why he doesnt like him PERIOD Instead of the orthodox answer one would expect from a parent along the lines of I do like you or I dont just like you but I love you Troys baffling response is the complete opposite PERIOD

He tells Corey he doesnt have to like him that he gave him his life and liking him wasnt a part of the deal PERIOD

Though long winded I would rate the film . stars PERIOD I found Fences to be riveting dramatic and eventful and I would definitely recommend that everyone see it PERIOD

Illumination fell short with its newest film PERIOD
