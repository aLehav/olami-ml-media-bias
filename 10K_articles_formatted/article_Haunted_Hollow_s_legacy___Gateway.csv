Haunted attractions across Omaha have been roping in scare enthusiasts throughout the entire course of this years Halloween season PERIOD

As the season enters its final week Haunted Hollow is going strong through Oct  PERIOD Located in La Vista this haunted theme park is packing itself to the brim with actors adorned in ghoulish makeup to keep the scares coming PERIOD

The park has been keeping up the tradition of scares fit for everyone since  when Jill and Mike McCormick opened a haunted attraction on their property right next to their house PERIOD Originally with the help of their two sons they continued to grow to the now  acres of area the park now spans across PERIOD

Haunted Hollow is new every year PERIOD We are always adding new attractions and expanding Mike said PERIOD

One of the latest addition to the park is the circus area that has come into fruition this past year PERIOD

The circus draws inspiration from intimidating clowns and overall mysterious feel of a rundown amusement park PERIOD Within the circus section is a variety of separate attractions including carnival games and a freak show. its fun to see your friends get scared said Michael Rogers an actor and makeup artist at Haunted Hollow PERIOD

Rogers works every night of operation to ensure that makeup gets done for the up to  to  actors that will be skulking around the premises PERIOD

Im mainly one of the demented clowns that running around outside Rogers said When Im not doing that I play a psycho character that typically screams and yells at people. one of the several roles Rogers takes on is that of a chain saw wieldera staple in the haunted industry and of Haunted Hollows scare arsenal PERIOD

The park also has more toned down attractions for those seeking a moment of piece amidst the fast pace chaos that surrounds all haunted attractions PERIOD With tarot card readings and games at booths guests are able to take a moment to relax PERIOD

A unique feature of Haunted Hollow is its efforts to give back and participate in the community PERIOD This year the park has taken school groups such as drama groups and show choirs into its ranks of acting volunteers PERIOD

The opportunity not only gives the young actors to take a swing at a new method of interactive acting but also yield rewards for those who participate PERIOD

They bring a certain amount of actors every night for a week and we make a huge donation to their club Mike said PERIOD

Jill and Mike both say that the biggest issue facing haunted attractions in the region is a lack of scares PERIOD By bringing in young thespians from the surrounding schools they have found a solution while also helping the community in return PERIOD

They can do this instead of car washes and bake sales Jill said PERIOD

Haunted Hollow is open every day of week starting a  p.m PERIOD through Oct  PERIOD Those who are interested in participating the haunted theme park can contact Haunted Hollow for more information PERIOD
