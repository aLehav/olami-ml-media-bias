The golf team tees up on Sunday and Monday during the fourth and final tournament the Binghamton Fall Invitational PERIOD

The Broncs have not found great success on the course this season finishing almost at the bottom of the previous three tournaments PERIOD

Head Coach Bob Whartenby believes that playing in different weather conditions has been an issue for the team the entire season PERIOD

I think we just need to play a little bit better and grind it out a little bit better in bad weather Whartenby said PERIOD It seems like were fairweather golfers right now and unfortunately golfing is not like that. junior captain James Buttermark witnessed the team struggle on the course firsthand PERIOD

Weve had our ups and downs this year Buttermark said PERIOD We would have a couple good rounds as a team in a tournament and then a bad round PERIOD We just couldnt find any consistency. whartenby  used to play the Binghamton Invitational at Hiawatha Landing golf course when he played for Rider as a student athlete PERIOD He expects his golfers to encounter the same challenges he faced when playing on the course PERIOD

We used to play it in the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference Whartenby said PERIOD I expect the scores to be high PERIOD This course is very difficult PERIOD Its long and going to be cold PERIOD It is a very tough golf course. for the last tournament of the season Buttermark has two things he is working on specifically to help improve his overall skills PERIOD

Its my short game and my putting and thats whats hurt me this fall so far Buttermark said PERIOD If I could make a couple more putts here and there I could be in contention in a lot more tournaments. just the consistency is whats bothered me the most. whartenby agreed with his team captain and believes that the entire team needs to practice their game around the greens PERIOD

Unfortunately short game and putting is exactly what it is Whartenby said PERIOD Its getting the ball up by the green and not getting it up and down or threeputting or just not hitting it close PERIOD These guys have worked a little harder this week on putting versus going out there and playing so hopefully the practice will pay off this weekend. the Broncs recently placed thirteenth out of  teams at the Cornell Invitational but Whartenby is hoping for a stronger performance from his team at Binghamton PERIOD

There are  teams in the field and I would like to be in the top six he said PERIOD I think it will show what these guys can do if their short games are a little better.",Bronc golfers driving for top six finish  â€“ The Rider News,Rider University
