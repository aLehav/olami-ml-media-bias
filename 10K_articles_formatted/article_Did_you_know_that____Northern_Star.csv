Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Stephanie CrombieApril  

The drinking age in England is  but you can only drink until  p.m PERIOD Most pubs have last call between  and  p.m PERIOD Some dance clubs are licsenced to serve alcohol until  a.m PERIOD but you have to pay and arm and a leg to get in and then another arm and leg to get a drink PERIOD

Most movie cinemas in England will show at least  minutes worth of commercials and previews before the actual movie starts PERIOD

Theres no university bookstore PERIOD Getting books in London means obtaining the list of books you need and then finding them on your own PERIOD This includes going to almost every bookstore in the entire London area and at times waiting for up to six weeks before receiving your order PERIOD

Pedestrians dont have the right of way at crosswalks in London PERIOD Drivers in London dont have to slow down or stop just because youre in the middle of crossing the road PERIOD The only time pedestrians have the right of way is when the crosswalk pole at their intersection has its orange light on PERIOD However these poles are usually only found in heavy shopping districts PERIOD

Everyone in England lines up for things even at the bus stop PERIOD There can be  people at one stop but they will all be standing in a single file line and get on the bus accordingly PERIOD

Buying theater or show tickets in London is simple PERIOD You call the ticket office and buy them over the phone PERIOD If you decide to not go all you have to do is call the ticket office and return them PERIOD If the show is sold out before you got the chance to buy tickets all you have to do is arrive early and wait in a line outside the theater PERIOD Chances are you can get lucky and pick up a returned ticket from someone who called in to cancel PERIOD
