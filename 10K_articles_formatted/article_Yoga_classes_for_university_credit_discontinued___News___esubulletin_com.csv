As of Tuesday Thompson had  students enrolled in one class and  in another PERIOD Thompson said in the past she has offered to teach a third class to accommodate the overflow but has been denied PERIOD

In her time at ESU Thompson has taught yoga to more than  students PERIOD

Now I wont be able to reach those people to help them because my class is a whole lifestyle Thompson said PERIOD

The reason behind discontinuing the class for institutional credit is due to the HPER department wanting to try out other activity classes said Shawna Shane chair of the health physical education and recreation department PERIOD

We just try to change things up every once in awhile Shane said PERIOD

Cessalie Wood junior nursing major said she disagrees with the universitys decision to discontinue Thompsons yoga classes PERIOD Wood took yoga with Thompson last fall and this spring and said she is an asset on campus because everyone knows her PERIOD

If her classes are always full and even over the limit sometimes then obviously people enjoy the class and the results that they get from it Wood said PERIOD
