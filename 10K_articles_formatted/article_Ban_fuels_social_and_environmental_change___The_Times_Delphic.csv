Between the free blue water bottles each student received the filtration machines and the lack of disposable plastic water bottles its clear that the water bottle ban is in effect PERIOD But has the LEAD capstones efforts made an impact The TimesDelphic sat down with Thomas Westbrook the chair of the interdisciplinary undergraduate concentration in leadership education and development PERIOD

TD What was your role in the class and the students

TW I facilitated the capstone course last fall that the students initiated that as the class product PERIOD The class project in the capstone LEAD program is one that requires students to bring some value to an organization through some change initiative to create positive social improvement PERIOD

TD What was the first step in reducing bottled waters presence on the Drake University campus

TW Sodexo was the start in many respects PERIOD The students met with Sodexo General Manager Danny Cronzier and he was absolutely encouraging indicating that Sodexo had worked with other campuses in this initiative PERIOD He had some alternatives PERIOD He made some suggestions and he suggested how the students could move forward PERIOD They have been absolutely a strong strong advocate of this initiative the best the best advocate youd want PERIOD

TD Do you feel the program is a success

TW Yeah three things happened PERIOD We restricted sale of the plastic water bottles   so you dont see those on campus PERIOD A lot more hydration stations that was the second success PERIOD Every new student was to get a refillable plastic water bottle which I understand they have PERIOD Even prospective students in admissions get plastic water bottles PERIOD So absolutely its having a real good initial success PERIOD

TD What are students using as an alternative to the Drake water bottles

TW All catered events no longer include plastic water bottles PERIOD Thats a huge success and a major credit to Sodexo PERIOD Some of the meetings Ive been in I have seen plastic cups PERIOD All students not just LEAD students an initiaitive might be to encourage Sodexo to use paper cups that are recyclable instead of plastic PERIOD That would be a nice next step but again that would be a student initiative because the class is over PERIOD

TD In tangible terms what has changed on campus as a result of the ban

TWYeah some people are bringing their own I see people carrying them around PERIOD But three things happened PERIOD We restricted sale of the plastic water bottles so you dont see those on campus PERIOD A lot more hydration stations that was the second success PERIOD There were a lot more installed over the summer PERIOD Three every new student was to get a refillable plastic water bottle which I understand they have PERIOD Even prospective students in admissions get plastic water bottles PERIOD So absolutely its having a real good initial success PERIOD

TD Obviously there is still Smart Water do you feel that it has effected the success of the program

TWThe restricted ban on the sale of plastic water and plastic bottles was not to include two things PERIOD First right now the sale of water bottles at athletic events PERIOD That has to be as the president indicated phased out over a certain period of time PERIOD And the second one which the class wrestled with is enhanced bottled water where there are vitamins added PERIOD In essence its more valuable or more nutritional water than you would get out of the tap PERIOD So the restriction was just simply on the sale of water regular water in plastic bottles PERIOD Thats not to say it shouldnt be extended but that was what it was PERIOD

TDHow do you see this program developing

TWI think its going to be up to the students PERIOD I think the students themselves will need to make some decisions around the future of that PERIOD When I say students I dont just mean LEAD students I mean Drake students PERIOD So hopefully the students will get behind efforts to expand it on campus and off campus that would be my hope PERIOD But as the first capstone class project it did achieve what it set out to do PERIOD Leadership is measured by results and I think we had some excellent results PERIOD
