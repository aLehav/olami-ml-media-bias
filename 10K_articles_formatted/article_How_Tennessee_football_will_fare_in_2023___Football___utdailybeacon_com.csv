Thousands of Tennessee fans rushed ShieldsWatkins Field in a avalanche of celebration moments after Tennessee took down Alabama on Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

Year three in the Josh Heupel era has arrived in Knoxville PERIOD Following  wins in   the highest count for Tennessee since   expectations have surged nationwide for the Vols this year PERIOD Despite having to replace multiple AllSEC performers like Hendon Hooker and Jalin Hyatt the mission for Tennessee is to win an SEC championship and potentially more PERIOD A new yet familiar starting quarterback named Joe Milton III coupled with several new and returning players at wide receiver will significantly influence the degree of success Tennessee achieves against a challenging gauntlet of opponents PERIOD

Heres a look at the  schedule PERIOD

Virginia neutral site

The season opener marks the first time the Vols have begun a season in Nashville since  as they will play a pseudohome game in Nissan Stadium against Virginia PERIOD Secondyear Virginia coach Tony Elliott led the Cavs to a  record in  in a season cut short by an oncampus shooting that claimed the lives of two Virginia players PERIOD

The Cavs would be thrilled to make a bowl game in  and are picked to finish near the bottom in the ACC by many publications PERIOD Tennessee is a significant favorite in this game and is expected to win by multiple touchdowns PERIOD

Austin Peay

Tennessee opens the  home slate on Sept PERIOD  against Austin Peay PERIOD After a  campaign under the leadership of head coach Scotty Walden the Governors will aim to achieve what would be considered a miraculous upset against their instate neighbors from Knoxville PERIOD

Fans eager to catch a glimpse of star freshman quarterback Nico Iamaleava will likely see their wish fulfilled before this game ends PERIOD The Vols are expected to send the Governors back to Clarksville with a loss PERIOD

 Florida

The Vols will kick off SEC play under the lights in The Swamp against Florida PERIOD The Gators embark on this season with a secondyear head coach Billy Napier who still has a significant amount to prove to Gator fans following a  finish in  PERIOD Anthony Richardson a topfive pick who troubled the Vols last year has departed and Wisconsin transfer Graham Mertz has assumed his position at quarterback PERIOD

Expectations for Florida are modest this year and Tennessee is already a sevenpoint favorite on the road PERIOD However Tennessee has not secured a win in Gainesville since  PERIOD

UTSA

This is no typical cupcake home game for Tennessee PERIOD UTSA returns nine starters on offense from a team that went  a season ago PERIOD Among those returning is star quarterback Frank Harris who is among the best players in the American Athletic Conference PERIOD

The Vols must do their best not to overlook the Roadrunners who may be ranked in the top  when they travel to Knoxville on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD If Tennessees defense does not come to play this game could turn into a shootout PERIOD The longer UTSA is in the game the more dangerous it becomes for Tennessee PERIOD

South Carolina

Before Nov PERIOD   not many people had this game circled as one of the most important of the  season PERIOD But after Tennessees playoff hopes were destroyed by the Gamecocks last year fans of both teams have had their eyes set on this rematch PERIOD

South Carolina quarterback Spencer Rattler will look to follow up his unbelievable performance from last year and try to lead his team to another upset PERIOD Tennessee will attempt to defend its home field in a stadium that South Carolina has not won in since  PERIOD

Texas AM

After a bye week Tennessee hosts Texas AM in a fullcapacity Neyland Stadium for the first time ever PERIOD They played in a partially full stadium during the  COVID19 season PERIOD The Aggies are coming off a disappointing  season that they started ranked in the top  PERIOD

The Vols will be wellrested heading into this matchup and will need a complete effort to contain this talented AM roster PERIOD The progression of sophomore quarterback Connor Weigman up to this point in the season will go a long way in determining the outcome of this one PERIOD

 Alabama

The  edition of the third Saturday in October rivalry was one for the history books PERIOD Tennessee defeated Alabama in one of the most highprofile games of the year and changed the outlook of their season and football program PERIOD Alabama will be seeking revenge and will be led by a new quarterback and coordinators on the offensive and defensive side PERIOD

The ability of Nick Saban to integrate his new coordinators and players will go a long way in determining who wins this game PERIOD Alabama has only lost five home games since  and has not lost in BryantDenny Stadium since Joe Burrow and LSU conquered the Crimson Tide in  PERIOD To win this game Tennessee will need their best performance of the season PERIOD

 Kentucky

Tennessee is  against Kentucky dating back to  PERIOD In  Tennessee destroyed the Wildcats  in front of a soldout Neyland Stadium PERIOD This year the rivalry travels back to Lexington in what will be one of the biggest games of the year for both teams PERIOD

Transfer quarterback Devin Leary from NC State will be a large factor in the success Kentucky has this year PERIOD The pairing of Leary with Kentuckys offensive coordinator Liam Coen has Wildcat fans dreaming of what could be this season in Lexington PERIOD The Vols will have to fight hard to win this one PERIOD

UConn

After the hiring of head coach Jim Mora UConn has steadily improved from being one of the worst football programs in the FBS PERIOD Mora led the Huskies to a bowl game last season and finished with a record of  PERIOD This remarkable turnaround for the Huskies has revived Moras career and he is looking to continue to build on that success in  PERIOD

After four conference games in a row the Vols will have a small break from the SEC grind when they host the Huskies in Neyland Stadium for homecoming PERIOD Whatever happens in the earlier part of UTs schedule the Vols will still be heavy favorites over UConn in this game PERIOD

 Missouri

Tennessee has scored at least  points in two straight wins against the Missouri Tigers PERIOD The Tigers will have to keep the Vols well under that mark this time to have a chance to win this game PERIOD Led by quarterback Brady Cook Mizzous offense has struggled at times in the past to move the ball and put points on the board PERIOD

Missouri head coach Eli Drinkwitz has garnered a reputation for being an offensiveminded coach PERIOD But with his offenses failing to produce up to an elite standard year after year the pressure is on him to deliver in  PERIOD The Vols have also had no trouble winning in Columbia PERIOD

Georgia

In what may be the toughest game on Georgias schedule the twotime defending national champions travel to Knoxville in the Vols penultimate game of the regular season PERIOD It will likely be the only game in Neyland Stadium this year that Tennessee is not favored in PERIOD

Georgia will have to replace reliable starting quarterback Stetson Bennett with unknown sophomore Carson Beck PERIOD Beck has played sparingly as a backup the last two years and now will be relied upon to lead the offense PERIOD Georgias defense will again be among the best in the country as is the calling card for head coach Kirby Smart PERIOD Tennessee will need a nearperfect performance on both sides of the ball to pull off this shocker of an upset PERIOD

Vanderbilt

The Commodores of Vanderbilt saw significant improvement in head coach Clark Leas second season going from  in  to  in  PERIOD Those five wins included backtoback victories over Kentucky and Florida PERIOD However their bowl chances were dashed by a  drubbing at the hands of Tennessee in Nashville PERIOD

In what will be senior night for many important players on Tennessees roster expect the Vols to come out inspired in this rivalry game PERIOD Vanderbilt has not won in Neyland Stadium since  and has not been able to handle Heupels offense yet in the two previous matchups the Commodores have had with Tennessee PERIOD
