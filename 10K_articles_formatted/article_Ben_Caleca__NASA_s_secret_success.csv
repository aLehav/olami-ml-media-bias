Early in his campaign Barack Obama introduced a plan to fund education  by partly delaying funds for Constellation NASAs shuttle replacement program PERIOD He justified the plan by saying that the U.S PERIOD wont have engineers and scientists if we dont have kids who are able to read write and compute. due to the current financial crisis budget cuts in many governmental sectors are inevitable PERIOD But the fact that politicians are quick to call out NASA as a waste of federal funds is  sad because NASA isnt just about science fiction or pointless exploration PERIOD NASA is about investment in new technology PERIOD Its a surprisingly efficient means of jumpstarting techdriven industry and making useful discoveries something that most people just dont realize PERIOD

What has a lot of scientists and engineers scratching their heads is that Obama later seemed to counter his own education funding plan PERIOD He directly contradicted his earlier statements when addressing crowds in Florida and Texas where NASA creates thousands of jobs for engineers technicians and service workers PERIOD Obama talked about how the space program needs funding PERIOD In order to implement the Constellation program which is meant to carry astronauts into space starting in the next seven years PERIOD While it may have been political pandering it now appears NASA will continue to receive a high level of funding PERIOD

The arguments against NASA often come from the idea that the space program is a gigantic waste of money which isnt true at all PERIOD Strictly looking at the cost side its actually just a drop in the bucket of the U.S PERIOD budget PERIOD Its . billion budget is less than one percent of the overall budget and has never exceeded four percent even at the height of the space race PERIOD Yet in polling the average American believes a quarter of all taxes go to NASA programs PERIOD

But no matter the cost NASAs projects are worth it PERIOD For every dollar put into NASA the technology has developed returns several times over in new products in fields ranging from medicine to sportswear PERIOD And the average American gets to enjoy the benefits PERIOD The sensor systems developed for the overbudget Hubble Space Telescope are what allow you to document your night on the town with your digital camera PERIOD The expensive corrections made to the Hubble when it was found to be flawed turned out to be a boon for medical imaging systems giving doctors the ability to detect cancers extremely early and saving countless lives a year PERIOD

Of course there are two big questions that always end up being asked why not directly invest in medicine and why not let the private sector handle space flight The truth is that investing in one specific science doesnt always give you the right answers PERIOD We fund medicine we fund other fields but its in the crosssection of these innovations that the most creative solutions to our problems are found PERIOD Diversity of thought and experience generates more overall knowledge and valuable lessons are learned even when the projects fail PERIOD

Private industry cant be counted on to invest in things that wont turn an immediate profit PERIOD While companies like SpaceX that make space flight a private business venture are great for the field raising capital for an industry with as much risk as space flight is difficult at best PERIOD Some investors in private space flight such as Paul Allen are only doing so because of their personal love of the field PERIOD NASA and other programs like it worldwide need funding to cover the hard science from which only governments can realize a tangible benefit PERIOD

Its partly true that NASA has some issues with the Space Shuttle being a prime example PERIOD It was meant to be reusable cheaper and safer than traditional rockets but repeated use has proven its anything but that PERIOD Both government and public support keeps the program going while replacements such as the VentureStar program were canned for being a waste of resources PERIOD

Our space programs problems stem from equal parts funding and oversight PERIOD Instead of lavishing funds on highprofile projects and cutting corners on smaller ones that only seem to make headlines if they fail NASA needs better review of projects and proper funding to make sure projects get it right the first time as much as possible PERIOD Smarter leadership has led to the decision to make the Constellation program one based on reliable proven technologies that save lives and money PERIOD With better accountability and a focused vision for realistic goals NASA funding will remain a wise investment for the Obama administration PERIOD
