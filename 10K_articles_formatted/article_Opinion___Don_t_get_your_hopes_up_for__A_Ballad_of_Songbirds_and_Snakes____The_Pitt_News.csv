By  Jameson Keebler For The Pitt News September  

Now that the kids who grew up during the Hunger Games craze are all grown up it is time for Suzanne Collins to get some more cash out of the property PERIOD The film adaptation of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes the prequel to the Hunger Games series is set to come out in  and while the cast is stacked with young stars the movie is not going to be a meaningful addition to the series PERIOD

The choice to focus an entire novel and film on President Snow hurts the powerful metaphor that exists in the center of the story PERIOD Breaking down the villain that is supposed to be a standin for an entire political system only waters down the allegory PERIOD

The Hunger Games is written as a glimpse into the dark future of America PERIOD Collins doesnt hide this as she has revealed that the idea for the novels came from channelsurfing and switching channels between reality TV and news footage from the Iraq war PERIOD The series is also meant to represent the televised shootings especially of children that occur in America every day PERIOD

With this fact in mind it is easy for anyone to put together the reality TV elements that come from the flashy and flamboyant Capital and the majority of people who live in the districts and die for the entertainment PERIOD The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes abandons this concept PERIOD This novel attempts to humanize the Capital which was previously interpreted as a representation of the worst urges of humanity PERIOD

It follows Coriolanus  President Snow before he is given that title  as he works as a mentor in the tenth Hunger Games PERIOD He is a poor orphan by Capital standards so this is depicted as an important career opportunity for him but he also shows a natural talent for the games and enjoyment in the more violent aspects PERIOD

In the novel he has to mentor Lucy Gray a quirky and outgoing teenage girl from District  PERIOD At the beginning of their partnership it is solely professional PERIOD His motivation for keeping her alive is solely the social and political advances that it would bring him PERIOD This shifts once he falls in love with her PERIOD

The original series follows Katniss a poor teenager who is forced into a life of violence and death in order to represent a movement that she never wanted to have responsibility for PERIOD In contrast Coriolanus only comes off as narcissistic as he whines in his penthouse PERIOD He is poor but he is Capital poor not District poor PERIOD His inherited penthouse is underfurnished but he is not Gale putting his name into the reaping forty times in order to buy supplies to keep his family alive PERIOD

This story attempts to give background on key pieces of symbolism from the original series but the development of these symbols weakens their effect PERIOD It feels like she is screaming Remember when this happened before Wasnt that book great

The most obvious example of this is the obnoxious use of roses PERIOD In the original stories Snow sends Katniss roses as a veiled threat PERIOD It is a reminder of his ultimate control and that he will always be watching her even in her home PERIOD In the prequel roses are everywhere PERIOD Coriolanus is constantly being gifted roses and giving them to others with no acknowledgment of the emotional weight that they held in the original series PERIOD If someone only read this novel they would probably only think Wow this guy really likes roses

Another moment of damaging context came at the climax of the novel PERIOD It is revealed that Lucy Gray the District  tribute that Coriolanus fell in love with wrote The Hanging Tree Katnisss signature ballad which is used to rally the people PERIOD Throughout the original series the song is interpreted as a chilling description of a murder and the darkness of life in the districts PERIOD It is assumed to be passed down through District  an eerie reminder of those they have lost to the capital PERIOD

This prequel explains that Lucy wrote the song word for word after her own experience PERIOD The song loses its status as folklore and instead it becomes a cheap retelling of a scene that is played out right before us PERIOD Now we know that when President Snow heard the song he wasnt thinking about the war that he caused but the girl that he dated for a few months PERIOD

The character of President Snow was not something that required elaboration PERIOD His villain arc is satisfyingly tied up within the original series PERIOD The audience sees him as the cruel dictator but we also meet his granddaughter a polite young girl who is enamored with Katniss to the point of wearing her hair in a braid PERIOD We see Snows discomfort at seeing these traits in someone that he loves PERIOD

Later in the series when he is captured and set to be executed by Katniss she instead kills Coin and Snow is trampled by the people of District  PERIOD This is an acknowledgment that all power is not held within people PERIOD Those people eventually succumbed to the corrupt system that kept them in place PERIOD

Writing a 517page novel diving into Snows character and over explaining every aspect of his personality undermines the ending that the original series built up to PERIOD

It is hard not to read this as either a dumbing simplification or a response to the political climate of when this novel was released in  PERIOD It seemed like a weak call for unity as it is no longer the rebels against the rulers but everyone together  although anyone below the highest of elites who lived through  could say that is not true PERIOD The rich were able to stay safe from the pandemic and continue to get richer while minimum wage workers put their health on the line because their labor was deemed essential PERIOD

As someone who saw herself as Katniss when reading for the first time I was confused on what was expected of me as the reader PERIOD It seems as though Collins no longer expects the reader to look up to Katniss but to Coriolanus the young adult uppermiddleclass social climber who has just enough trauma to make up for his bad parts PERIOD

This novel was a disappointment and you can not expect more from the upcoming film adaptation PERIOD The Hunger Games is just another property that has fallen into our current entertainment cycle of constant remakes and prequels that hardly evoke the spirit of the originals PERIOD
