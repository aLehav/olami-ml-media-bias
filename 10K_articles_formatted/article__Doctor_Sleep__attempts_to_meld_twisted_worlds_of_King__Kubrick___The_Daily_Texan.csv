Doctor Sleep directed by Mike Flanagan is both the film adaptation of Stephen Kings novel of the same name and sequel to Stanley Kubricks classic horror epic The Shining. in Doctor Sleep familiar character Danny Torrance is now grown but continues to grapple with his familys tragic legacy alcoholism and strange mindbending gift known as the shine PERIOD When a young girl named Abra with similar abilities reaches out to Danny he becomes aware of a terrifying cult that feeds off the life steam of those who shine PERIOD

Ewan McGregor assumes the titular role of adult Danny PERIOD Tasked with emoting the effects of a traumatic childhood and a perilous fight with alcoholism McGregor has a lot on his plate PERIOD He puts on a calm yet strong performance as Danny mirroring the sensitive and observant child audiences met in the original film PERIOD Dannys character arc serves as the backbone of the film emphasizing the theme of locking away past demons and moving forward PERIOD

Rebecca Ferguson steals the show as the menacing Rose the Hat PERIOD As leader of the infamous True Knot cult Ferguson consistently straddles the line between intimidating and charming PERIOD For most of the film she projects an uncomfortable amount of stability refusing to show any weakness PERIOD As her character emerges as the antagonist of the film Ferguson appropriately dials up the evil and unpredictability PERIOD

The cinematography and set design are phenomenal PERIOD Flanagan and his team miraculously conjure visual elements from Kubricks original classic PERIOD The sets of the film are identical to those featured in the 1980s classic with Flanagan using the original blueprints from Warner Bros. storage PERIOD During recreations of moments from the previous film the camera movement is much more calculated and calmly dynamic PERIOD Additionally the camerawork pays direct homage to iconic shots such as the notorious overhead view of a car winding its way up a mountain PERIOD

While Doctor Sleep is aesthetically pleasing and wellexecuted the film struggles to succeed in its overall narrative PERIOD Dannys metaphorical and literal journey against his past demons is effectively conveyed through familiar locales moments and characters PERIOD Overall Dannys character arc is genuinely
cathartic and mesmerizing for longtime fans of the character PERIOD

When it comes to the absurdity that is Abras constant battle against the malicious True Knot gang things go off the rails PERIOD

Doctor Sleep completely throws all subtleties from the original movie out the window by introducing an endless amount of powers that apparently come packaged with the shine PERIOD In the film people with this gift are able to possess others falsely project themselves into reality use invisible gusts of wind and track others simply by holding an object theyve touched PERIOD In Flanagans defense many of these elements are present in the novel but they come off as overly extravagant when translated to the screen PERIOD

Doctor Sleep was an impossible feat from the beginning PERIOD To effectively combine the worlds established by Kings original novel and Kubricks iconic interpretation is unheard of PERIOD Flanagan genuinely succeeds in several aspects of this task but the absurdity of Kings novel muddles the effectiveness of Kubricks established narrative PERIOD
