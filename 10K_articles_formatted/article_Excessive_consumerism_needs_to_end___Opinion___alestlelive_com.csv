Humans have a problem PERIOD Consumerism has taken over and were depleting our planet of not only its resources but of its integrity PERIOD

We need to shift our society away from consumerism PERIOD We invest too much money in products that only benefit big businesses PERIOD

Companies have figured out how to lure consumers in at unfathomable rates everyday we see ads and commercials encouraging us to buy something new PERIOD

Companies sell us the idea that with each new product they offer  clothing electronics cars etc PERIOD  our lives will become more luxurious while in reality theyre simply looking for a way to bring in more cash PERIOD

Too many big businesses only care about one thing profit PERIOD Not only are we giving it to them but we are also ignoring the process they take to provide us with quick products at a cheap price PERIOD

At surface level this can seem minuscule  so we like to shop and we dont want to go broke doing it whats the big deal

Well what if I told you this success you feel after creating a new wardrobe for a cheap price is actually extremely costly and this is just another way to help our capitalist rulers of society thrive This problem is in all industries but the fashion industry in particular is wreaking irrevocable havoc on our planet and it has literally killed hundreds of people PERIOD Companies are making their goods overseas paying the laborers the bare minimum while paying no mind to their terrible working conditions and then selling them at rates that make them billions PERIOD

Sweatshops are a terrible reality of inexpensive clothing but we tend to ignore the consequences behind purchasing products for an unreasonably cheap price PERIOD Not only do employees in these clothing factories barely make enough to survive they are also working in extremely hazardous environments PERIOD

I recommend watching The True Cost on Netflix to gain a better understanding of this nightmare we are facing PERIOD After watching I instantly took a look at everything I was inadvertently buying into PERIOD Everything that had been out of sight was suddenly running through my mind and I was sickened to realize how guilty I was of contributing to such a harmful marketplace PERIOD

A company that has taken big strides into fair labor is Patagonia PERIOD They now use their website to not only sell clothing but to provide a platform for activists to promote fair trade and many other environmental movements PERIOD

We no longer buy items to use for a long time instead we use them up and then throw them out PERIOD On their blog The Cleanest Line Patagonia wrote Owners are empowered to take responsibility for their purchasesfrom proper cleaning to repairing reusing and sharing PERIOD Consumers take make dispose and repeata pattern that is driving us towards ecological bankruptcy. take some time to check out Fair Trade Certified to see what products are ethically made and educate yourself on how to help add equity to everyone involved in production PERIOD

Its expensive and as college students we most likely wont be able to make sure every single product we own has a fair trade label but we need to do our best PERIOD

We can all start by using what we have shopping at consignment shops as much as possible and doing our best to only purchase items that are fair trade PERIOD
