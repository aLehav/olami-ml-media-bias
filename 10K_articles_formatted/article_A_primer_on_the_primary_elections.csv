Welcome or welcome back Towson PERIOD In case you havent noticed were in presidential election season  though with all the bombast that Donald Trump has been spewing I think itd be pretty tough not to notice PERIOD

But yes PERIOD The election cycle is in fullswing  the Republicans have already had their first debate  even though the general election is at the time of writing Aug PERIOD    days away PERIOD In Maryland the primary election isnt even until April  . and yet every day youll find a headline about Hillary Clinton D and Donald Trump R PERIOD

The stories about the candidates over the next year will continue to explore and exploit every possible angle about every single candidate because election cycles are great for news organizations PERIOD Theres a lot at stake and therefore a lot of interest in even the most minute stories PERIOD

In case youre curious which yes you should be but maybe not quite yet there are currently five declared candidates from the Democratic Party and  declared candidates from the Republican Party that have been featured in five or more major independent nationwide polls PERIOD Vying for the nomination from the Democratic Party are Lincoln Chafee former governor of Rhode Island Hillary Clinton former secretary of state Martin OMalley former governor of Maryland Bernie Sanders a senator from Vermont who has identified as an independent in the senate and former Virginia senator Jim Webb PERIOD Vice President Joe Biden has publically expressed interest in running but has not declared anything PERIOD

According to the latest polling data from Real Clear Politics the top  contenders for the Republican nomination are businessman Donald Trump former governor of Florida Jeb Bush former director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Ben Carson governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker Senator Marco Rubio from Florida Senator Ted Cruz from Texas Carly Fiorina the former CEO of HewlettPackard Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky John Kasich governor of Ohio and Mike Huckabee former governor of Arkansas PERIOD

Those are of course not all of the candidates the Green and Libertarian parties for example will have candidates as well and more will likely join the ranks before dropping out after primary elections and caucuses start to happen PERIOD It should be noted that in Maryland New Jersey and Delaware primary elections are closed and voters can only cast a ballot within the party that they are registered PERIOD

As the election cycle trudges on coverage will continue daily in print online and on TV PERIOD This column however will be holding back until things get closer PERIOD



As things get closer will we also get closer to more journalistic styles of writing By that I mean unbiased coverage on both parties PERIOD I fully understand T.U PERIOD is a predominately leftleaning University like most but it would be nice for someone who is more independent like myself to get some straight forward articles to look forward too Hope thats the plan keep on keepin on PERIOD
