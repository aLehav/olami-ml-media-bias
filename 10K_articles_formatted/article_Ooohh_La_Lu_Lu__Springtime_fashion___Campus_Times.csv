Even though in Rochester the beginning of spring seems to be quite delayed this year there is no reason for us to match the grey sky PERIOD While we wait for the weather to become warmer and the sun to come out I have compiled a short list of must have items and where to find them so you can be prepared when the flowers spring up PERIOD

Try a midi skirt for a fun retro feel on those days that are still cool and windy PERIOD My suggestion Topshops Texture Gathered Knee Midi Skirt in pale blue PERIOD Find it at www.topshop.com PERIOD

Get your hands on a pair of colorful sunglasses like the Light Brown Color Block Retro Sunglasses of River Island  fashionable functional and the company provides free shipping every day PERIOD Find them at www.us.riverisland.com

Two great options for tops are Zaras Crossover Poplin Top and River Islands Silver Metallic Jacquard Wrap Over Top PERIOD Find them at www.zara.com and www.us.riverisland.com respectively PERIOD

Last but not least if you are looking to spice up your undergarments I recommend Elle Macphersons Golden Feather Bra and Bikini Brief you can find these items on www.asos.com or locally at Devil May Care on Park Avenue PERIOD

One outfit I would highly recommend trying out is a pair of skinny jeans with an asymmetrical top a pair of high heel sandals and a leather jacket PERIOD These are sure to keep you warm and fashionable during these chilly spring days PERIOD

Happy Spring and happy shopping
