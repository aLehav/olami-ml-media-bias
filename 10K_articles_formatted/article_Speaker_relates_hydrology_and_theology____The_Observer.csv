Most people do notassociate fresh water scarcity and religion but visiting speaker Dr PERIOD Christiana Peppard suggested a definite correlation in her lecture What does Hydrology have to do with Theology on Tuesday night at Saint Marys PERIOD

Peppard said the United Nations and the Vatican have demonstrated a link between the two concepts establishing that the accessibility ofwater exists is also a life issue PERIOD

Water should be regarded primarily as a human right and not as an economic commodity Peppard said PERIOD It is a good of creation intended for all now and in the future. she said although water is a fundamental right many still cannot access it but people who use this resource every day may grow used to it and dismiss its importance PERIOD

Water becomes invisible because its clean we dont need to think about it and we take it for granted Peppard said PERIOD It cannot be substituted or replaced by anything else PERIOD Because it is nonsubstitutable it is something that fits in uncomfortable ways with economic logic. disparity in accessibility to water serves as a major ethical issue according to Peppard PERIOD

The invisibility of water in our lives is a privilege Peppard said PERIOD Many people in the world dont share that privilege PERIOD Many people in the world spend parts of their days wondering whether or not the water will be available today in the faucets or in a town pump and if its available how long it will run for and if it runs for a while whether it will be clean PERIOD Still others lack any kind of water infrastructure at all. peppard said a relationship between hydrology and theology can be traced back to the book of Genesis in the Bible as water existed even before humans and animals did PERIOD

Before there was life there was water Peppard said PERIOD Human survival has always been linked to the availability of sufficient quantities of fresh water. she said scholars of religion and ecology discovered connections between these two studies through a detailed analysis of where water appears both in Bible passages and in religious traditions PERIOD

The landscape is in the text in a certain way Peppard said PERIOD You could also think of rituals and practices PERIOD Baptism is the foundational sacrament for the Christian community of course PERIOD What do we learn about waters theological or ethical significance through that sacrament

People share a global responsibility to make the world a better place through understanding the moral significance of water she said PERIOD

The fact of the matter is that access to water is a condition for any kind of life and it is vital Peppard said PERIOD The absence of clean fresh water in so many places is what has brought this issue to the attention of the U.N. the Vatican and numerous environmental and social justice organizations. according to Peppard the omnipresence of water makes it an elaborate issue but that does not mean people should not attempt to understand its complexity PERIOD

No matter what stage of your education you are in there are questions all of us can ask Peppard said PERIOD Your career choices are also ethical choices PERIOD Where you put your energy and actions are ethical choices not just pragmatic choices based on your degree. share This Story
