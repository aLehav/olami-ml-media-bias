This week a University professor unfoldedthe colorful history of the Golden Age of Hollywoodfor this weeks Senior Session hosted by the Spencer Museum of Art PERIOD

Delbert Unruh a theater professor at the University talked about the  and the Barnum and Bailey of musical revues.About  seniors saw the artwork as Unruh displayed his collection of costume designs that were made to celebrate the American girl from  PERIOD

The reason for these designs is still unknown and many of these designers have been lost to history Unruh said PERIOD There was very little respect for the art then and with the hit of the Depression costume design became somewhat less of a priority. ranging from pen and ink drafts to intricately detailed water colors Unruh presented work by dozens of artists and many of them are unknown today PERIOD

We dont even know what productions these designs were made for Unruh said PERIOD The designs were typically seen as the property of the producers of the show rather than of the designers themselves and many were treated poorly. unruh showed a watercolor with painstakingly realistic details marred by notes and chicken scratch that shopkeepers and producers scribbled beside on and around the art PERIOD Unruh in the process of writing a book himself about the era of the Follies said that he even found a costume design with a large boot print on it PERIOD

I was most struck by the beauty of the design drawings and the fact that they were not prized in their own time often scribbled upon and discarded said Nancy Hernandez the coordinator of the Senior Session program PERIOD

Unruh also explained the evolution of the Follies which really took off during the golden age of reckless spending PERIOD

Ziegfeld would spare no expense when it came to his shows once using several hundred yards of gold lam inone group costume Unruh said PERIOD The purpose was to display beautiful women and The Follies quickly became the most popular thing on Broadway. unruh described how lax regulations in the theater led to a race to nudity as designers began dressing the woman in very little and sometimes nothing at all PERIOD

There was a performance where a young beautiful lady actually bathed in a tub full of champagne Unruh said PERIOD She was completely nude and given that the audience was primarily men we can kind of understand how that happened. the Spencer Art Museum along with the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute holds weekly Senior Sessions from  a.m PERIOD to  a.m PERIOD each Thursday and all ages are welcome to enjoy an hour or free entertaining education Hernandez said PERIOD
