Desks in a classroom in the Huey P PERIOD Long Field House on February   PERIOD

LSU students will soon return to campus for inperson virtual and hybrid classes in order to minimize risk of COVID19 outbreak PERIOD One former student though is pushing for students to be able to opt for virtualonly classes PERIOD

LSU alumna Nalo Zidan posted a petition on Aug PERIOD  titled STUDENTS  FACULTY FOR MOVING LSU FALL  SEMESTER ONLINE. the petition expresses concern over the University not offering an onlineonly option for the fall semester PERIOD In the petition Zidan said the University hosts a significant number of immunocompromised students and faculty and the University is irresponsible for gathering these individuals into one place for the fall semester PERIOD

As of Aug PERIOD  the petition on change.org had  signatures out of the  signature goal PERIOD

Hybridmodel classes a style of learning that places students into groups that dictate what days they attend inperson and what days they attend virtually has become the alternative for most courses on campus PERIOD Zidan however called these hybridmodel classes dangerous and unacceptable. sports administration senior Austin Ash said he recognizes the problem with hybridmodel courses and will not return to inperson classes until either a vaccine is developed or students can follow the simple guidelines properly. construction management junior Nicole Armanini on the other hand disagrees with Zidan about the dangers regarding the hybridmodel classes PERIOD

I completely understand and agree with why they are going with a hybridstyle teaching Armanini said whose classes are all virtual this semester PERIOD But I wish we had more of a choice for our classes. according to biological sciences junior Tina Vu this option would be very beneficial to outofstate students who are moving away from home just to attend class one day per week PERIOD

They are wasting thousands of dollars just to come back to Baton Rouge for that one class Vu said PERIOD

The University released an updated roadmap for the upcoming fall  semester on July  PERIOD
