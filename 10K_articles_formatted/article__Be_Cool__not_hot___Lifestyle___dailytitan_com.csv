Updated November     pm



Be Cool the sequel to Get Shorty is being released  years after the original came out in theaters PERIOD While Get Shorty was an instant hit the same cant be assumed about this movie PERIOD

Based on the novel of the same name by Elmore Leonard Be Cool is about Chili Palmers John Travolta transition from movie producer to music producer PERIOD Frustrated with the movie industry Chili decides to partner himself up with his friends wife Uma Thurman on their indie record label PERIOD Having discovered a singer he believes has talent Chili sets out to promote her and make her a success PERIOD

But first he has to contend with the Russian mafia a rival music producer Cedric the Entertainer and her manager Vince Vaughn who refuses to let her out of her contract PERIOD

John Travolta has fun with the role and plays it to the full effect PERIOD He plays the role with a lot of charm and charisma and is able to capture your attention to what is happening on screen with Chili PERIOD

Although Christina Milians role is minimal she does what she can with the character she was given to play PERIOD Her screen time consists mostly of her singing PERIOD If she has any acting potential the movie didnt let her show it here PERIOD

Uma Thurman is excellent in her role as the cofounder of the indie label PERIOD Her and her character fit together She comedic ability comes naturally and isnt forced PERIOD

Additionally Uma Thurman and John Travolta display the natural chemistry they seem to have between the two of them PERIOD In a scene in a nightclub they both revisit the dance scene from Pulp Fiction and both seem to not have lost that magic PERIOD It didnt hurt that the Black Eyed Peas provided the music PERIOD

Also the Rock turns in a hilarious performance as a gay bodyguard who wants to make it into the movies PERIOD

Hes shown in his past films as he does here that given the right role he can definitely act PERIOD While this movie is a sequel you do not need to have seen the first movie to understand anything or who anyone is to enjoy this movie on its own PERIOD You wont feel as if you are missing out on anything PERIOD Judging by their laughter they really enjoyed themselves PERIOD In short it is a good movie that will entertain and not disappoint anyone who likes a good laugh PERIOD
