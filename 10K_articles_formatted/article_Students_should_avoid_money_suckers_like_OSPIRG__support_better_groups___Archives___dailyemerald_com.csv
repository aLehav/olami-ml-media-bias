7651,1970-01-01,"in response to Jesse Houghs letter to the editor Student groups soliciting on campus shouldnt be passed by in the Sept PERIOD  Emerald

This is an FYI to every student at the University PERIOD We need you to walk by those tables faster We represent every student at the University of Oregon who pays incidental fees to support offcampus interest groups like OSPIRG in other words all of you PERIOD We agree that extracurricular activities add to students well being but we encourage students not to participate in the unethical management that is perpetrated year in and year out by groups like those listed by Hough PERIOD There is a reason why OSPIRG was defunded by popular vote a few years ago because it sends our money your money to a statewide organization PIRG that uses it for its own political agenda PERIOD The Multicultural Center on the other hand is a tyrannical program that attempts to monopolize the voice of minorities on campus by labeling everyone and their grandmother racist PERIOD And as far as joining the College Democrats thats as worthless as joining the College Republicans PERIOD

There are plenty of things to do in Eugene that dont involve parasitic dogmatic interest groups PERIOD For example you could play a club sport go on a hike with the Outdoor Program or make yourself a sweet cereal bowl in the Craft Center PERIOD Whatever you do remember you are an individual with the capacity for free and independent thought PERIOD The University has a long history of herding sheeple into irrationally acting factions PERIOD Just make sure you participate in oncampus organizations because you want to be part of a solution and not part of an agenda PERIOD In the words of the knight at the end of Last Crusade choose wisely. ossie Bladine
