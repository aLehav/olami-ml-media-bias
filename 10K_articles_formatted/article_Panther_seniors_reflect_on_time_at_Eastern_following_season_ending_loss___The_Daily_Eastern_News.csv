Autumn Schulz Assistant Sports EditorMarch  

EVANSVILLE IND PERIOD  The Eastern womens basketball teams  loss in the first round of the OVC Tournament to Tennessee State was the last time that its three seniors stepped on the court sporting a Panthers uniform PERIOD

Seniors Kira Arthofer and Abby Wahl closed out their basketball careers with ten points each PERIOD Arthofer was 4of5 from the field with eight steals and five assists while Wahl added nine rebounds PERIOD Jordyn Hughes had seven points six assists and three steals to add to the contest PERIOD

Head coach Matt Bollant said the group helped change the program with their work both on and off the court and that he is very proud of what they have accomplished these past four years PERIOD

They came in and Eastern was three hundred and forty-sixth RPI the season before they came in and yesterday in the net ranking we were  thats one hundred and fifty spots jumping Bollant said PERIOD It may not seem like a big deal but that is there are good programs in Division I and you know when we recruited them we said help us change this program and obviously when we said change we were envisioning being at the top but to go from last to fourth is a big jump PERIOD I am really proud of what they have done in the classroom they are pretty much straight a students . and we raised thirteen thousand six hundred dollars for families in our community PERIOD These guys have been nearly perfect off the court and that culture has changed in our program and these three were a big part of that. the veteran players will walk away from Eastern knowing that they are in the history books PERIOD Arthofer is on two of Easterns top10 lists her  career steals earned her the sixth place in program history while her  career assists put her in seventh place PERIOD

Wahl became the twenty-sixth player to achieve the 1000point mark for her career back in December and then in February became the tenth player in program history to reach  points and  rebounds PERIOD Hughes was one of the programs top shooters throughout her time as a Panther PERIOD She ended the regular season shooting . percent from the threepoint range the fourth best in the conference PERIOD

Losing any player that adds stability in scoring is extremely hard but it is especially hard when you lose three at one time PERIOD Bollant said that he is not too worried about it because the group he has coming in gives him confidence in the team going forward PERIOD

Obviously we got some holes to fill and these guys have meant a lot to us and done a lot and Im not going to worry about that today Bollant said PERIOD Obviously we got four kids coming in but today is about these guys and making sure that they are okay and ready to handle the adversity of not finishing well today. walking away from a program that they have spent four years of their life with is going to be hard for the three seniors PERIOD However Wahl said that she could not have asked for a better place to spend these last four years of her life PERIOD

Its meant everything PERIOD We all came in as freshmen and were all going out together which is rare for a Division I basketball team Wahl said PERIOD Just the friendships and the sisterhood that our team has is amazing and I couldnt have asked for a better place to be with the girls that I had and we made the most of it and no regrets we played our hearts out PERIOD Its been a good four years. hughes is thankful for the life lessons that have come out of these last four years PERIOD

The friendships we made like Abby said but also the resiliency PERIOD Its hard we had a lot of adversity over the four years PERIOD So I am thankful that I learned those life lessons and I am stronger because of it. arthofer said that she feels that the group is leaving the program in a spot that puts the up incoming players in an excellent position to achieve great things PERIOD

I think that we are leaving this program in a spot that we didnt come into and I think thats a big step and these girls coming for the next couple of years they are good players Arthofer said PERIOD They are going to do just great things and I cant wait to watch them and see what they can do. autumn Schulz can be reached at  or emailprotected PERIOD
