By Lucy Bridges Staff Writer October  

The indie band Arctic Monkeys released a funky new album titled The Car on Friday PERIOD Consisting of  songs the bands seventh studio album is short in comparison to others of its kind but each track is packed full of unique lyrics and unparalleled instrumentation allowing for The Car to truly stand out to indie music fans PERIOD

The Arctic Monkeys have been singing writing and performing together since  PERIOD The bands dynamic meshes well together allowing them to continue creating meaningful and popular music for fans PERIOD The band consists of lead singer Alex Turner lead guitarist Jamie Cook drummer Matt Helder and bassist Nick OMalley PERIOD

Other than the release of their live concert album Live at the Royal Albert Hall in  The Car is the Arctic Monkeys first studio album since  when they released Tranquility Based Hotel  Casino. despite having taken a four year hiatus from releasing music the band still accumulates . million monthly listeners on Spotify PERIOD Easing fans back into their music the Arctic Monkeys released the single Thered Better Be A Mirrorball in August creating anticipation for the impending album release PERIOD

The Car inhabits a jazzy vibe that carries soul through the tracks PERIOD Turners voice imitates an old schoolesque sound that adds a retro element to the album PERIOD Making the tracks on this album more unique Turner brings a soft and calm vocal dynamic avoiding overpowering the song with unnecessary intensity PERIOD

The song that is the namesake of the album The Car is unique in the sense that the lyrics make up the timeline of a story PERIOD Alex Turner poses as the storyteller for this track in particular PERIOD Turner sings in an almost narrative style soft but direct adding phrases together such as But it aint a holiday until  you go to fetch something in my car  a travel size champagne cork pops in order to create a specific memory PERIOD



The single I Aint Quite Where I Think I Am released on October  has generated traction among indie fans PERIOD Turner carries his soulful vocals into this single but adds a tinge of 70s retro twang to his voice PERIOD I Aint Quite Where I Think I Am is one of the more energetic songs on the album and Turner pushes more power from his diaphragm generating a forceful high vocal range sound PERIOD The lyrics of the single match precisely with the title and persona of the song as Turner sings The disco strobes in the stumbling blocks and Formation displays of affection fly over  Eyes roll back. there is a purposeful sense of confusion that is portrayed through the single adding to the cool relaxed and muted tone of the song PERIOD

Although the lyrics are interesting and unique the instrumentation on each track sets the album apart from other indie albums PERIOD The soft beat that Helder carries on the drums throughout each track amplifies the jazz subtleties which add up to create a soothing portfolio of rich blueslike music PERIOD

As the album hops from track to track the instrumentation style changes with each song pushing soulful jazz in one and groovy guitar humming in another PERIOD Although the style changes throughout the album there are consistent elements of soothing guitar and steady drum rhythm that create cohesiveness throughout the music PERIOD

The Arctic Monkeys have stepped back into their comfort music style after waiting to release the new album PERIOD Indie fans will be able to listen to The Car which is full of lazy day calming and funky music that reincorporates The Arctic Monkeys into their playlists PERIOD
