Weve always been pretty successful when weve had lots of guys scoring in double figures senior Mike Wilkinson said PERIOD Today it just showed how well we shared the ball PERIOD We got some looks and guys knocked them down. the Badgers jumped on the Wildcats right from the opening tipoff as they built an early  lead scoring on five of their first six possessions PERIOD Clayton Hanson got Wisconsin off and running with a quick  on the Badgers first possession PERIOD While Davor Duvancic scored an inside bucket Wisconsin rattled off the next nine points to give the Badgers a lead they would never relinquish PERIOD

Northwestern was able to right the ship a bit after that eventually cutting the Badgers lead to four after a Duvancic layup made it  PERIOD

After finding the going tough on the inside freshman Brian Butch stepped outside and knocked down a pair of big 3point shots as the Badgers fended off the Wildcats rally midway through the half PERIOD He seemed to feed off the two treys as he was able to get inside and score as well as pull down a teamhigh five boards PERIOD Butch was able to score eight of his careerhigh  points in the first half including the 3pointers PERIOD

I think for any player it gets a lot easier when that first shot goes down Butch said PERIOD Im getting better every game my confidence is coming and I just keep on playing hard. wisconsin then went on its decisive run late in the first half as it outscored Northwestern  over the final eight minutes of the half to head to the locker room with a  advantage PERIOD

Taylor padded his stats during the run dropping in three 3pointers as well as a baseline jumper as he led Wisconsin with  firsthalf points PERIOD

When he knocks down shots hes awful hard to guard Northwestern head coach Bill Carmody said of Taylor PERIOD You get up on him and hes very fast and very strong and very hard to contain. the Badgers looked like they came out a little bit on cruise control in the second half as they did not have the same offensive flow they had displayed at the end of the first half PERIOD Wisconsin hit just three field goals during the first  minutes of the second half but stayed in the game by knocking down  free throws during that stretch PERIOD For the game Wisconsin was  from the line compared to Northwestern which shot a paltry  PERIOD

However by the  mark of the second half Northwestern had cut the lead to seven at  PERIOD It looked as though the Wildcats were ready to push the Badgers all the way to the finish PERIOD However Northwesterns top player Vedran Vukusic had already fouled out with only nine points leaving them shorthanded as they made the final push PERIOD Vukusic who averages . points per game was saddled with foul trouble early and was never a major factor in the game PERIOD Without Vukusic the Wildcats rally never amounted to anything substantial PERIOD

Im glad we came back and we did something and played hard but we never quite threatened Carmody said PERIOD If we could have hit a  or something and cut it to four we could have bothered them. wisconsin responded to Northwesterns run rattling off an  run to push the lead back to  PERIOD Despite trading baskets with the Wildcats during the final two minutes the Badgers final margin of victory remained at  PERIOD

We took that blow PERIOD We took that run that they made and got some good shots you know some wideopen ones and got to the rim a couple times and then got to the freethrow line Badgers head coach Bo Ryan said of the way his team responded to the Wildcats run PERIOD We needed that down the stretch. senior Sharif Chambliss led the late charge bracketing a Hanson jumper with a 3pointer and a driving layup on his way to scoring eight of his  points in the second half PERIOD

He took advantage of some opportunities and got to the rim a couple times had that wide open  that went down Ryan said of Chambliss PERIOD Hes a guy who understands the moment PERIOD He doesnt get too low doesnt get too high PERIOD With that experience he was able to understand the situation and make some pretty good decisions PERIOD When the ball goes in those are some real good decisions. along with Taylor Butch and Chambliss Wilkinson and Hanson each added  points giving the Badgers five players in double digits PERIOD Zach Morley contributed a teamhigh five rebounds as well as two steals PERIOD

Northwestern was led by Mohamed Hachad who was the only Wildcat player in double digits scoring  points PERIOD
