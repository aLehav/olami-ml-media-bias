Remember Me



From the left came a parade of wheel chairs walkers and wet suits PERIOD From the right a collection of ablebodied Stony Brook students PERIOD Both sides existed to achieve minor miracles. next came laughter splashing shrieks of joy and more splashing PERIOD The pool deck flooded with enthusiasm PERIOD While under close supervision a synergy was taking place between the participants and the instructors in training PERIOD

The Adapted Aquatics program at Stony Brook University is a highly specialized training program PERIOD It is designed to teach university students to adapt aquatic and therapeutic skills to the needs of people with severe physical and multiple disabilities through handson interaction PERIOD

Peter Angelos persistence to develop this program into an academic course that allows students to receive a variety of credentials licenses and certifications while doing hands on coursework is what makes this program an ongoing success PERIOD The progress of the disabled participants and the blossoming of the university students fire his passion to continue to direct this program even after  years PERIOD



If I lose my enthusiasm it is time to hang up my bathing suit said Angelo the director of Adapted Aquatics and Emergency Response Programs PERIOD

The program began as a pilot program in  for the Suffolk County Red Cross and was meant to determine the feasibility of creating an Adapted Aquatics program in a university setting PERIOD This attempt occurred in universities all over the country Stony Brook University was the only program to succeed PERIOD

The swimming department at Stony Brook needed a driving force to pull this program together and Angelo had just graduated from the university PERIOD

Angelo was in training to become a distance swimmer in the U.S PERIOD Olympics when he was yanked into the Adapted Aquatics program immediately after graduating with a bachelors in biology and psychology PERIOD He was asked if he would be willing to develop a curriculum for the program and excitedly accepted the offer PERIOD

I was thinking of doing some give back Angelo said PERIOD

He still remembers hearing stories of his grandmother who had a massive stroke and was forced to live in a wheel chair for  years of her life PERIOD He explained that if there had been a program like this for his grandmother her life would have been improved tremendously PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Angelo is doing Gods work said Sam Ramos whose 11yearold son Zach is a cancer survivor with nerve damage PERIOD According to Ramos Zach will never be a track star but after seeing the way he can move in the pool he doesnt set limits for himself PERIOD

Participants students and fellow faculty members are grateful for their interaction with this program and the driving force behind it Angelo said PERIOD

Trudi Torn and Keri Novothy have both been bringing their children Nick and Heather to Adapted Aquatics since they were six years old PERIOD Both of them have cerebral palsy and are wheel chair bound PERIOD Now they are in their 20s and still participate in the program every Thursday night at  p.m PERIOD

It is the best thing I do all week long for my kid Novothy said PERIOD

The program is not the work of just Angelo PERIOD Physical therapists and veteran teaching assistants also advise the Adapted Aquatics program PERIOD All of the program advisors are volunteers none of them receive a salary PERIOD They are simply giving back PERIOD

Rob Belizar is a volunteer physical therapist and Stony Brook graduate PERIOD He has been involved in the program since he was a freshman in  PERIOD Adapted Aquatics encouraged him to pursue his dreams to become physical therapist PERIOD

His job as a volunteer is to help college students adjust to working with the disabled PERIOD He gives them participants background information which is stored in case files starting from their first day in the program PERIOD There are many familiar faces because participants feel comfortable returning PERIOD Belizar is not a medical advisor but he ensures the safety on deck and helps set reasonable goals for the participants PERIOD

Not only do the participants learn to increase their mobility in the water but students learn how to work with people with disabilities PERIOD The program provides specialized therapy free of charge to amputee participants and those with disabilities such as muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy PERIOD

Colin Bedell is a former volunteer and adaptive aquatics minor PERIOD He was introduced to the program in the first semester of his sophomore year and since then he has developed a strong connection with participants in the pool PERIOD

His work in this program is extraordinary Bedell said of Angelo PERIOD He is an amazing man with outstanding accomplishments. in order for the program to maintain its current standard of excellence Angelo has fought an uphill battle with the university PERIOD

After receiving his graduate degree in English Angelo was given full charge of the program in the late 1970s PERIOD Its curriculum was part of the Stony Brook physical education department but like many other programs it struggled to stay afloat PERIOD

My theory was that the best marriage would be between my program and physical therapy Angelo said PERIOD And I got my wish. with the help of former university president Dr PERIOD Shirley Strum Kenny Angelo was able to attach the Adapted Aquatics program to the School of Health Technology and Management or SHTM in  PERIOD

I busted my rearend for that entire year to make sure we were solid Angelo said PERIOD

When Adapted Aquatics attached itself to the SHTM the budget for the year became  PERIOD This meant that the budget per semester is  before paying for faculty members equipment mail paper phones and other necessities PERIOD

The department had to decide the price for a participant in the Adapted Aquatics program PERIOD In the end it was decided that the program would be free of charge because the university students needed to learn from the participants as much as the participants needed the therapy PERIOD

We are running this thing on peanuts Angelo said PERIOD When asked if he was going to start charging he said that would be a last resort PERIOD He says he is happy to do what he can to improve the lives of the disabled PERIOD

Paulie Piotti is a 10yearold with Down syndrome and hearing impairment who has been attending Adapted Aquatics since he was 17monthsold PERIOD According to his mother he loves swimming at Stony Brook so much that he carries his bathing suit and swim bag around the house all week long PERIOD The program has improved his muscle movement and his teachers tell him he is the strongest child with Down syndrome they have ever seen PERIOD

Angelo is humbled by the compliments he receives PERIOD

Take the geometric progression of how many people I taught and how many people my students have taught we are talking in the hundreds of thousands of people that either learned how to swim or been saved from dying while swimming by something that we did said Angelo when asked about the impact he has had PERIOD

Angelo and his team strive to achieve what they call minor miracles PERIOD

A big miracle would be to get someone who was in a wheel chair to walk again Angelo said PERIOD But the minor miracle is to get the person in the wheel chair to have hope. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
