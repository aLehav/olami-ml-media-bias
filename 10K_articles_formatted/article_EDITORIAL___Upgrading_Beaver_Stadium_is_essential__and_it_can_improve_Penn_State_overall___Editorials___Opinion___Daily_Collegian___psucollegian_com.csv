Attendance reached  fans in Beaver Stadium for Penn State footballs White Out game against Auburn on Saturday Sept PERIOD   in University Park Pa PERIOD The Nittany Lions beat the Tigers  PERIOD

From THON to the Lion Shrine Penn State is an institution rooted in tradition PERIOD

But no tradition better exemplifies the Penn State experience than football games in Beaver Stadium PERIOD Whether it be the White Out or Zombie Nation Beaver Stadium has found ways to create memorable experiences for the  who have flooded the stands since  PERIOD

Beaver Stadium serves as more than just a venue  its a source of recruiting PERIOD Not just 5star recruits but future students and fans of the program PERIOD

A football game at Beaver Stadium is a spectacle and serves as a way of creating future Penn Staters PERIOD And just as James Franklin said Penn State needs to improve upon its athletic facilities it must also revamp Beaver Stadium to compete against other programs PERIOD

As a part of the universitys Facilities Master Plan announced in  Penn State Athletics is asking for input from select participants on how to best renovate Beaver Stadium following a stadium concept study that began in May  PERIOD

Because Penn State is based around traditions and Beaver Stadium is a staple for State College there may be some push back from alumni and Penn State lifers who may not want to see any change in Athletics and the stadium PERIOD

But just as Beaver Stadium saw its own change in  when the original stadium was disassembled it will need to modernize in order to enhance the experience for fans and student athletes alike PERIOD And in turn this will benefit the rest of the university PERIOD

One of the biggest possible changes is the decrease in total seating PERIOD While the idea of 107K Strong is yet another staple of Penn State fans must weigh whats more important capacity or comfort

Theres no need for expensive seats since students typically stand for the majority of the game but some are unstable and could use chair backs PERIOD While it may take away from Franklins montra making Beaver Stadium a more welcoming and safe venue will help improve the recruiting process PERIOD

There also needs to be an emphasis on improving sustainability efforts PERIOD Stadium clean up following games is flawed and groups of students shouldnt have to wake up at  a.m PERIOD on the day after a game to clean up the mess of others PERIOD

Something as simple as adding extra trash and recycling bins can help create a more sustainable stadium and community PERIOD But the onus remains on attendees to make the right choices with their trash PERIOD

Beaver Stadium must adapt and evolve as these renovations can lead to a more enjoyable experience for all who enter PERIOD Not only does it need to be more comfortable but visually appealing as well PERIOD

The aesthetic of the stadium is lacking compared to other venues around the Big Ten PERIOD The inside is welcoming but the same cannot be said about the exterior as well as underneath the stadium which is more industrial PERIOD

By putting more emphasis on the spectacle of the game like the University of Alabamas program itll show Penn States interest in bringing in more fans from all degrees of interest in football PERIOD Whether that be improving on the lighting or opting for a wider HD scoreboard bettering the quality of experience for fans can maximize profits PERIOD

To increase earnings Penn State should also consider selling alcohol at Beaver Stadium PERIOD It wouldnt be the first Big Ten stadium to offer this at concession stands and with students and fans already tailgating prior to the game it seems inevitable that alcohol sales will be permitted PERIOD But just like at other venues alcohol sales need to be heavily regulated to make sure attendees dont become too rowdy PERIOD

While Penn State might not be the first university to sell alcohol it can still stand out with other renovations PERIOD One way of doing that offering free and efficient WiFi PERIOD

This is a rare find at collegiatelevel stadiums  the University of Oklahoma led a movement for fast WiFi in   but that doesnt mean its not achievable PERIOD Penn State has the money to make this happen which will set itself apart from many other universities PERIOD

Depending on the success of this survey Penn State should consider utilizing this format to see what other forms of infrastructure around campus can be improved upon PERIOD This could see a high amount of responses coupled with educational insight on how to improve the quality of life on campus PERIOD

Facilities all around Penn State are lacking in quality PERIOD While the first impressions of the university may revolve around football the popularity of programs like wrestling cannot be emphasized enough PERIOD

If wrestling is going to remain in Rec Hall then some changes are needed PERIOD People will come no matter what but that doesnt mean the experience cant be better PERIOD And considering other sports play there theres no reason why it shouldnt be spectacular PERIOD

On Wednesday Sandy Barbour announced her retirement  leaving  years left in the Master Plan originally created in  for the next athletic director to take on PERIOD They should follow Barbours vision and continue to upgrade the facilities across campus with the money brought in by the revamped Beaver Stadium PERIOD
