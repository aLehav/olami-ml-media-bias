Florida Southern College held its second annual Frank Lloyd Wright Mental Health Day FLW Day on April  which included food games and mental health programming throughout the day PERIOD

The Student Government Association SGA wanted to continue last years FLW Day tradition of having no class so students can enjoy the day off and have a mental break PERIOD However SGA was informed by the school that this years FLW Day could not be a day off of classes PERIOD

Instead SGA planned a fun day of events sunrise yoga intramural water balloon toss stuffaplush Sophie yard games at Roux Library and FLW Kickoff PERIOD There were supposed to be hot air balloons on Mr PERIOD Georges Green but due to wind it was rescheduled for another date PERIOD

There were over a dozen food trucks ranging from Mexican Thai and dessert foods PERIOD There were giveaways from the FSC Marketing Team and multiple vendors spread across campus HTeaO Ritas Ices and Rooted Lakeland PERIOD

In the evening there was a softball game a performance of The Diary of Anne Frank and a drivein movie in the Branscomb Auditorium parking lot PERIOD

Everyone seemed to have a great time there was plenty to do the timing for everything went smoothly from a students perspective and the food offered was great freshman Kamryn Potteiger said PERIOD

Overall the day was a huge success for SGA and the FSC community PERIOD So many people enjoyed all the activities throughout the day and it was nice seeing everyone happy smiling and stressfree PERIOD

There were students who wished that SGA could have canceled classes like last school year because students have been so burnt out lately PERIOD But all the planned events were more fun than a day off anyway PERIOD

Despite not having an official day off some professors still decided to cancel their sessions anyway PERIOD Many students disregarded their classes that werent canceled and attended the events on campus instead PERIOD

I liked how much they had going on and I appreciated that they spread it out all over campus sophomore Kelsey Lugannani said PERIOD What I didnt like was the fact that because we didnt have the whole day off it felt like there wasnt enough time to do everything. there was a large turnout for the events and free offerings so materials did run out which left people disappointed PERIOD The Sophie stuffaplus station and the free coffee and refreshers Rooted Lakeland was offering both ran out very quickly PERIOD

However there was a limited supply of things for the event and it shows how many people were actually out celebrating FLW Day PERIOD

For future Frank Lloyd Wright Days SGA should definitely continue hosting a day of events whether the school will allow a day off of classes or not PERIOD

It gives students the chance to get on campus and have fun with one another and its a great stressreliever if students participate PERIOD

I think the events on campus were better than a day off because everyone had the option to stay in or participate on campus Potteiger said PERIOD
