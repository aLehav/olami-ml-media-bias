In New Orleans the majority of porches are occupied by  a.m PERIOD People sit in wicker lounge chairs chatting with others seated in wooden rocking chairs while ceiling fans lazily turn in the breeze PERIOD Late morning in New Orleans epitomizes the Southern stereotype of relaxed laidback living PERIOD

But the city has much to offer beyond that easy southern stereotype PERIOD

Sightseeing in New Orleans involves walking around the Garden District PERIOD In this historic neighborhood enormous colonialera mansions compete for visitors attention each one outdoing the previous in grandeur in a sharp contrast to New Orleans crumbling infrastructure PERIOD

In the city exposed tree roots bulge over sidewalk seams often breaking through the cement PERIOD Twoblocklong puddles randomly line the streets even if it has not rained in days PERIOD Walking driving and biking become a slalom race through sinkholes cracks loose blocks and the occasional fountain spurting from the sewers PERIOD

New Orleans is an amazing city even though its corrupt PERIOD Theres not much money for public works even though there are city taxes said local resident Alex Payne PERIOD The thing about New Orleans is that its part of another time PERIOD Thats its appeal PERIOD You come here and its a different pace things work differently so people have a different type of social interaction. for residents and tourists alike the evening hours are often the beginning rather than end of the day PERIOD The city has a neverending list of musical events which are great opportunities for socializing PERIOD The music scene is legendary because of its wideranging styles and venues PERIOD Jazz concerts play in the French Quarter nightly impromptu brass bands perform at Hornets games and a cappella quartets sing on street corners PERIOD
