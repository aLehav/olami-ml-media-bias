Lady Gagas documentary Gaga Five Foot Two gave audiences unprecedented access into the chaotic uplifting and painful moments of being one of the biggest singers in the world PERIOD

The film premiered Sept PERIOD  on Netflix where audiences witnessed Gaga going through different experiences from recording the Joanne album to balancing a relationship to doctors visits for chronic pain treatments PERIOD Gaga holds nothing back PERIOD Whether someone is a longtime Little Monster or not her vulnerability and sincerity as she manages her professional successes and personal failures resonate with everyone PERIOD

Danielle Stanheim a freshman in political science at FIU said I think its definitely important to not pretend youre perfect PERIOD To me Lady Gaga seemed like an average pop star PERIOD I didnt follow her career much PERIOD I watched the documentary and was shocked by how intelligent and talented she was PERIOD It was difficult seeing her cope with her troubles but I was able to relate to her more because of it. it seems unexpected that a pop icon known for her polarizing fashion choices and performances could connect with the average person however she manages to break the illusion that made her famous and show us a human who is searching for what we also seek love acceptance and support from her loved ones PERIOD

Gaga shows that no matter our wealth and fame we are all the same at our core PERIOD She shows audiences her frustration with being alone and her desire for her familys support on her album PERIOD We see her in her element recording music and out of it having to get her makeup done while at the doctors office PERIOD The film does a great job at illustrating the dichotomy of fame from the mundane nomakeup moments at home to performing at Tony Bennetts birthday party PERIOD

One of the most poignant moments in the film was when Gaga went to visit her grandmother to play the completed song Joanne named after her grandmothers late daughter PERIOD Gaga was understandably nervous and I held my breath as Gagas grandmother listened to the song PERIOD Her grandmother loved it and the loving tribute to Joanne finally had her stamp of approval PERIOD

Of course not all moments were heavy and dramatic PERIOD Its still Gaga after all PERIOD We see her have a slight fender bender on her way to record a song get distracted dancing before the Superbowl halftime show and purchase copies of her own album at Walmart PERIOD

It was clear that with this new album Gaga was ready to show another side of her music PERIOD A tribute to her fathers late sister Joanne is probably her most intimate album so far PERIOD But she wasnt completely sure how her fans would receive it PERIOD Before shooting the Perfect Illusion music video we see her question whether her early fans will be disappointed seeing her dressed in a simple look rather than her signature avantgarde style PERIOD

Javi Gmez a senior in business administration said It just made me love Gaga more PERIOD Ive always been a fan and seeing her evolve as an artist and showing her talent in a new way is very exciting. while we see Gaga in a variety of roles throughout the film she is continually affected by her chronic pain PERIOD Although the film was created months ago Gaga is still struggling with the health issues she displayed in the documentary PERIOD She has become outspoken about her fibromyalgiachronic pain on her social media connecting with others who share the same condition PERIOD

According to the Mayo Clinics website fibromyalgia is defined as a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue sleep memory and mood issues. unfortunately there is no definitive cure for it PERIOD Earlier this month Lady Gaga had to reschedule the 8week European leg of her Joanne World Tour citing health issues PERIOD

What makes Gaga Five Foot Two such a landmark event for Gagas career is her willingness to share what it really took to make Lady Gaga the icon shes become PERIOD Shes hardworking and obsessive about her work not allowing pain or lack of preparation get in her way PERIOD

Gagas willingness to give us a fuller image of the life of an artist is something that will be appreciated for years to come PERIOD Sure an artist can write a memoir reflecting on their career PERIOD But having cameras follow Gaga during her journey writing Joanne coping with personal difficulties and finding the strength to make her album a success is something that words alone cant capture PERIOD
