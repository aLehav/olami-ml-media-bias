Spring break vacations are a funny thing PERIOD

They are not typical vacations like those you have taken in the past where you feel it is your duty to hit a museum or two PERIOD Nor do you feel a need to soak up the local culture  you would rather rape and pillage the society and sun and contribute to their tourism industry PERIOD

By the end of the trip you are convinced that not only is braiding your entire head a good idea but that putting 151proof rum in your coke is fantastic too and you cant live without getting a big ol straw basket PERIOD

Yes this would definitely describe my spring break vacation in the Bahamas PERIOD It all began with a flight to Fort Lauderdale Fla PERIOD in order to leave on a cruise to the island that left the next morning around  a.m PERIOD

When the alarm went off at our extremely budget  dare I go so far as to call it ghetto  hotel around  a.m. the last thing I could think about was sipping Bahama Mamas around the pool PERIOD

My friend decided that she wanted to take the first shower and I happily obliged her PERIOD

I had just delved back into the land of slumber when I heard screaming like I have never heard before PERIOD Not only was I now awake but I was extremely grumpy PERIOD I was more irritable when I realized that the reason she was wailing like a banshee was because of a lone cockroach PERIOD

Granted they are not my favorite things to encounter first thing in the morning while brushing your teeth but that early few things get me too excited PERIOD

On the ride over to the dock to catch the cruise our driver advised us to drink a lot and have as much sex as possible PERIOD Orgies were also seriously encouraged PERIOD Not necessarily bad advice but still a little strange at  in the morning PERIOD

We finally got on our ship and began drinking at  a.m PERIOD

Yes kids it was like DDay but more drunken and with better looking people PERIOD Keep in mind I said the people were only better looking not smarter PERIOD

Some girl even thought she was sober enough to do a tumbling routine PERIOD When she fell on her head and scraped open her nose she seemed to feel differently but at least the host of the contest she was in bought her yet another drink PERIOD

The Bahamas have a friendly culture and more men hit on you than you can shake a stick at PERIOD It doesnt matter what you look like or even if you speak English all girls are fair game PERIOD

One guy when we tried to turn him away told us that he was married and just wanted to know if we were having a good time PERIOD When my friend asked why he wore no ring he got offended and pointed wildly towards the corner explaining that his sisterinlaw was watching us PERIOD

He was only one of many PERIOD I managed to get extremely sunburned on the cruise  I looked like a Ronald McDonald reject PERIOD As a way to hit on me one guy actually walked up to me touched my skin watched me turn hypercolor and informed me that I was burned PERIOD Nice try PERIOD Another popular way to try to get a piece of a drunken girl seemed to be the offer of water contact PERIOD Not only was I asked to skinny dip but one guy even requested a shower PERIOD

The guys werent the only questionable ones PERIOD We were so stupid at times that when one of my friends fell over drunkenly it actually took six individuals  also drunk  to circle around her and figure how to help her up PERIOD Not exactly brain surgery PERIOD

The strangest part of this spring break phenomenon however is that you dont really understand what has happened until you get back to school PERIOD You know that youve had one hell of a vacation but you only remember about  percent of your trip PERIOD Even after viewing photos of your debacles you still only remember  percent PERIOD

Was it a fun trip Hell yeah PERIOD Would I do it again In a second PERIOD",Spring break shenanigans - Campus Times,University of Rochester
