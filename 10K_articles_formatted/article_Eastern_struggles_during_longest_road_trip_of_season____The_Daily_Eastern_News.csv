The Panther baseball team traveled south to Mississippi and Alabama as their seasonlong 13game road trip continued during spring break PERIOD Unfortunately for the Panthers its record went south as well PERIOD



Eastern dropped its first five games on the trip as the Panthers lost three to Southern Mississippi and two more to South Alabama PERIOD

Prior to the threegame series against 18thranked Southern Mississippi Panthers head coach Jim Schmitz noted the Golden Eagles were a really good team and just one game away from going to the Super Regionals in last years College World Series PERIOD After a three game sweep by the Golden Eagles in which the Panthers were nohit scored just three runs and were shut out twice Schmitzs statement proved true PERIOD

In game one on March  Southern Miss PERIOD jumped out to an early lead off Eastern starter Kyle Widegren and coasted to a  victory PERIOD Widegren a junior college transfer from Parkland lasted five innings but surrendered  hits and seven runs as his record fell to  on the season PERIOD

Saturdays afternoon tilt went down in history as the Golden Eagles Cliff Russum pitched the third nineinning nohitter in school history as Southern Mississippi rolled over the Panthers  PERIOD Russum struck out  of the  Panther batters he faced and walked just three hitters as the righthander improved to  overall PERIOD

He Russum controlled the game throughout and hes been pretty good every time on the mound this season Golden Eagles coach Corky Palmer said PERIOD Hes a real tough guy and it was a great effort. the Panthers best chance to push across a run came in the third inning when Marcus Jackson led off with a walk and then stole second base PERIOD Jackson advanced to third with two outs but was stranded 90feet from the plate when Jeff Cammann struck out to end the inning PERIOD

Eastern went down in order six of the nine innings and other then Jackson no Panther advanced past first base PERIOD

The Panther bats remained cold as Southern Miss PERIOD swepted the series with an  victory on March  PERIOD Freshman Patrick Ezell went eight innings giving up six hits walking none and striking out  to get the victory PERIOD

Patrick did a good job for us today Palmer said PERIOD I feel better about the next few weeks now that Patrick is pitching well for us. eastern used seven pitchers during the game with only freshman Brian Long going more than an inning PERIOD Junior righthander Anthony Billups took the loss for Eastern when he gave up three runs in the first inning PERIOD

Eastern faired little better in the series opener against South Alabama March  PERIOD Jaguar pitchers Bryan Adams and Bert Heath combined to onehit the Panthers as Eastern was held without a run for the third straight game and dropped the contest  PERIOD Marcus Jackson prevented Easterns second nohitter in three games with a twoout double in the fourth inning PERIOD

I thought our pitching and defense were good South Alabama coach Steve Kittrell said PERIOD Adams had good velocity on his ball and threw a good breaking ball PERIOD He walked a few too many five but had a pretty good outing. the loss spoiled a solid performance from Easterns freshman hurler Erik Huber who made his first collegiate start and went six innings giving up six hits and three earned runs PERIOD

Eastern made up for their offensive futility with  runs in the series finale against South Alabama however the Panther pitching staff could not hold an eight run lead in the seventh inning and lost a wild contest  PERIOD

Eastern ended its 28inning scoreless streak with two runs in the first off Jaguar starter Daniel Roberts PERIOD The Panthers quickly lost the lead as South Alabama struck back for nine runs in the first two innings PERIOD Easterns Matt Hall gave up seven runs five earned in   innings to take most of the damage from the Jaguars PERIOD

Eastern scored six runs in the fourth and seven in the sixth to open up an  lead after six innings but the bullpen of Alex Chapple Mike Manns and Andy Kuntz surrendered  runs in the seventh inning as South Alabama regained the lead  PERIOD

But the Panthers fought back in the top of the ninth with six runs to regain the lead  PERIOD Eastern brought in Jeff Cammann to close the game but the former third baseman could not end the teams nine game losing streak PERIOD Cammann was wild as he hit a batter to lead off the inning and then gave up a double and hit another batter to load the bases PERIOD Senior Brian Long entered in relief and enticed a Jaguar batter to hit a fly ball to center but Marcus Jackson dropped his second fly ball of the game to allow the tying runs to score PERIOD South Alabama won the game two batters later with a sacrifice fly from Brad Gordon PERIOD

Easterns  runs tie as the sixth highest total in NCAA history by a losing team and the  combined runs set a new Stanky Field record PERIOD
