There was a time over the last decade where romantic comedies were going through a Jennifer Lopez phase  she was Americas sweetheart and a boxoffice queen PERIOD

Now  are going through a different sort of obsession  the baby and marriage plot  and Lopez decided to hop on board with  a predictable and mostly forgettable new movie that adds nothing to this overdone fad PERIOD

The film stars Lopez as Zoe a pet store owner who after years of trying to find  decides to move on with her life by inseminating herself with a sperm donor PERIOD The day she goes through with the procedure however she shares a cab with Stan Alex OLoughlin and starts to reevaluate her plans PERIOD

Problem is just as the two start heating up she finds out shes pregnant and Stan must decide if raising kids with a woman he just met is worth it PERIOD

The movies plot is cute enough and if written correctly it might have been a fun alternative to the other baby movies made recently PERIOD Instead the flick stumbles over every pregnancy clich in the book PERIOD Theres a sloppy homebirth scene that freaks Zoe out about her own upcoming labor and traumatizes her male counterpart PERIOD Water breaks at inappropriate times while Zoe spends her pregnancy eating and feeling hypersexual PERIOD And when she looks into the camera takes a deep breath and says shes pregnant are viewers supposed to be shocked shes talking to the mirror not Stan

The movie also has a few uncomfortable scenes involving a singlemother support group Zoe joins PERIOD The women are all either unattractive earthy or stereotypically gay and they say weird and uncomfortable things to the pretty and  newcomer PERIOD When Zoe reveals to them that she may be involved with a man and would like some guidance the mothers obviously cant help her because they are weird and single and the possibility of love doesnt compute for them PERIOD

Its moments like this that make  so predictable and unfunny PERIOD There arent any fresh lines or laughoutloud moments that fulfill the comedy portion of this romcom PERIOD

Neither is there much romance PERIOD OLaughlin is an OK choice for the lead in a scruffy way but he comes off as bland PERIOD He doesnt connect well with Lopezs largerthanlife personality and their lack of chemistry and screen interaction makes one wonder whether their relationship is worth all this hassle PERIOD Theres nothing to suggest that this guy would want to go through all this trouble for a girl he just met and the viewer is never really sure that he should PERIOD If he walked away he wouldnt be at fault and that hovers over the movies entire midsection PERIOD

Lopez however is surprisingly likeable PERIOD Its been years since shes played this kind of role and it was hard going in to see her as anything but diva J.Lo PERIOD But her character is sweet and relatable one youd want to root for PERIOD This downtoearth persona is what made her a movie star to begin with PERIOD Perhaps her own recent experience as an older mother of twins has made her especially perfect for this role and shes preferable to the Katherine Heigls and Jennifer Anistons of the genre PERIOD

Despite Lopezs breathoffreshair presence and some adorable scenes involving her handicapped dog  should only be your Plan C when heading to the movies this weekend PERIOD
