VATICAN CITY  Pope John Paul II developed a high fever Thursday because of a urinary tract infection and was being treated with antibiotics at the Vatican his spokesman said PERIOD The latest health setback for the 84yearold pontiff came one day after he began receiving nutrition through a feeding tube PERIOD
The Holy Father today was struck by a highfever caused by a confirmed infection of the urinary tract spokesman Joaquin NavarroValls told The Associated Press by telephone PERIOD
The pope was receiving antibiotics at the Vatican NavarroValls said PERIOD
The medical situation is being strictly controlled by the Vatican medical team that is taking care of him he said PERIOD
Italian media said there were unconfirmed reports John Paul had received the sacrament of the sick and dying  what used to be called the last rites or extreme unction  but Vatican officials could not be reached for comment PERIOD The sacrament was renamed to reflect that it could be received by the sick as well as the dying PERIOD
At the Gemelli Polyclinic where the pope has been treated before an emergency room chief said there were no plans to admit John Paul at the moment the Italian news agency ANSA said PERIOD
Lights in the papal apartment above St PERIOD Peters Square were on until about  p.m. generally well past the papal bedtime PERIOD
Police cars and other vehicles were seen going in and out of the Vatican gates as the evening wore on and a small crowd of Italians who were following news on television began gathering at the edge of the square PERIOD
Earlier ANSA and another Italian news agency Apcom said the pope had suffered an alarming drop in blood pressure Thursday evening PERIOD
A urinary infection can produce fever and a drop in blood pressure as reported in the pope said Dr PERIOD Marc Siegel a specialist in internal medicine at the New York University Medical Center PERIOD
The popes risk of such an infection is heightened because he is elderly  which suggests his prostate is probably enlarged  debilitated and run down from the illness that recently sent him to the hospital Siegel said PERIOD
Urinary infections tend to respond well to antibiotics given either as pills or intravenously and I would suspect theres a very good chance hes going to recover well Siegel said PERIOD
Hospitalized twice last month following two breathing crises and with a tube placed in his throat to help him breathe John Paul has become a picture of suffering PERIOD When he appeared at his apartment window Wednesday to bless pilgrims in St PERIOD Peters Square he managed to utter only a rasp PERIOD
Later that day the Vatican announced he had been fitted with a feeding tube in his nose to help boost his nutritional intake PERIOD
The use of the feeding tube illustrates a key point of Roman Catholic policy John Paul has proclaimed It is morally necessary to give patients food and water no matter their condition PERIOD
As Parkinsons disease and other ailments have left him increasingly frail the pope has been emphasizing that the chronically ill prisoners of their condition  retain their human dignity in all its fullness. the Vaticans attitude to the chronically ill has been apparent in its bitter condemnation of a judges order two weeks ago to remove a feeding tube from Terri Schiavo the severely braindamaged American woman who died Thursday PERIOD
Vatican Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins reacting to Schiavos death denounced the removal of her feeding tube as an attack against God. while John Paul is fully alert some see parallels in the two cases PERIOD
Under John Paul Vatican teaching on the final stages of life includes a firm rejection of euthanasia insistence on treatments that help people bear ailments with dignity and encouragement of research to enhance and prolong life PERIOD
A  Vatican document makes the distinction between proportionate and disproportionate means of prolonging life PERIOD While it gives room for refusal of some forms of aggressive medical intervention for terminally ill patients it insists that normal care must not be interrupted PERIOD
John Paul set down exactly what that meant in a speech last year to an international conference on treatments for patients in a socalled persistent vegetative state PERIOD
I should like particularly to underline how the administration of water and food even when provided by artificial means always represents a natural means of preserving life not a medical act PERIOD Its use furthermore should be considered in principle ordinary and proportionate and as such morally obligatory. john Pauls 26year papacy has been marked by its call to value the aged and to respect the sick subjects the pope has turned to as he battles Parkinsons disease and crippling knee and hip ailments PERIOD
The Rev PERIOD Thomas Williams a Romebased theologian said there are parallels between Schiavo and John Paul based on the church teaching that such feeding is required PERIOD In that sense there is a great similarity he said PERIOD
But he pointed out that the pope has been fully conscious and running the church PERIOD Courtappointed doctors had determined that Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state with no hope of recovery before her death PERIOD Schiavos parents had argued that she could get better and that she would never have wanted to be cut off from food and water PERIOD
It is not clear who would be empowered to make medical decisions for an unconscious pope PERIOD The pope has no close relatives but the Vatican has officially declined to comment whether John Paul has left written instructions PERIOD
