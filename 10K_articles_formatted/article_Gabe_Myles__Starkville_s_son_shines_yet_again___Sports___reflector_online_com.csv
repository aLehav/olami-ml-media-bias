Who is Gabe Myles Is he a receiver a student or maybe even a hometown hero Is he all of the above Well to start Gabe Myles is classified as a redshirt freshman wide receiver for Mississippi State PERIOD However when you look beyond that you begin to see a story PERIOD The story of someone who grew up in Starkville and is getting the chance to live out his dream on the field PERIOD

Myles graduated from Starkville High School and has played all over field in his football career PERIOD At Starkville High Myles was the starting quarterback and played corner as well PERIOD He earned many accolades in high school he was a ClarionLedger Dandy Dozen and played in the MississippiAlabama AllStar game PERIOD The biggest accolade of all could be a scholarship from Mississippi State the school of his dreams PERIOD

To come and play at home that was my dream from the get go Myles said quite emotionally PERIOD I grew up watching Mississippi State football and it was the team I always wanted to be a part of PERIOD It is a surreal feeling I grew up watching it and now being able to actually do it you cant put it into words. not many of us get to completely fulfill our childhood dreams PERIOD We grow up wanting to play in the NFL or be Americas Next Top Model but Myles lives his every day PERIOD His father Eddie Myles played for MSU as well PERIOD Myles has worn Maroon and White as a fan long before he ever got the chance to do so as a player PERIOD He worked every day for the dream of donning the MState logo on the side of his helmet and he lives out that dream every Saturday on the field as a football player for Mississippi State PERIOD

It was a long journey recruited as a defensive back Myles redshirted his freshman year before switching to wide receiver PERIOD Last season when star receiver Jameon Lewis went down after the LSU game Myles was asked to fill in for MSUs leading receiver PERIOD

Last season while filling in for Lewis Myles showed flashes of the versatile and explosive weapon he could become PERIOD Totaling close to  yards he ran the ball caught screens and even got in an eleven yard pass PERIOD

Offensive Coordinator and Wide Receiver coach Billy Gonzales said Hes an extremely blessed player talentlevel wise PERIOD Last year he kindof broke in we threw him in as a redshirt freshman PERIOD But he got that playing time he got that experience. though Myles did not get enough time throughout the year to make a huge impact he played enough for everyone to see the bright future the young talent had PERIOD

This season Myles is not a replacement for someone else PERIOD He is stepping up and taking a role in the offense for his own PERIOD However the stigma of never scoring a touchdown is something that stuck with him PERIOD The first touchdown is something every player dreams of when they first don the Maroon and White PERIOD Well last Saturday that moment came PERIOD

With a minute and  seconds into the game Myles crossed the goal line for the first time PERIOD

Gabe Myles said I just wanted to get that touchdown monkey off of my back PERIOD I had envisioned it so many times PERIOD I had pictured it so many times when it finally happened it was just straight excitement. in a day that saw MSUs offense break the single game record for yards it was all started by that 49yard touchdown reception by Myles PERIOD In doing so Myles brought back memories of the explosive offense everyone remembers from last season PERIOD It did not take him long to score again Myles would find the end zone on a six yard run with eight minutes and  seconds left in the second quarter PERIOD

I think he has the career record for getting tackled at the one yard line head coach Dan Mullen joked after the game Saturday PERIOD Everyone was so excited because everyone jokes with him for not getting in the end zone I was just like dont trip dont trip. myles is a player living his dream and is an inspiration for others PERIOD He will be back in action this Saturday as MSU takes on Auburn PERIOD The game will be broadcasted on ESPN2 at  PERIOD
