Updated November     pm



























Early Thursday March  many woke up to the unfortunate news that the roof of the South Gym in the Marga Hosaeus Fitness Center had collapsed overnight PERIOD The Bozeman Fire Department was first to the scene responding to a call at  a.m PERIOD

The gym was originally built in  and was not part of any of the renovations that took place in  PERIOD Engineers estimated that the roof on the North Gym would also collapse which happened as predicted around  p.m PERIOD on Saturday March  PERIOD All classes and activities in the fitness center have been cancelled until March  when the situation will be reevaluated PERIOD The structure of the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse has been announced as sound and all events scheduled there will continue as planned PERIOD

The collapsed roofs were relatively flat in structure with only a small pitch and while experts are unsure of the exact cause of failure extreme temperatures and snowfall are likely to blame PERIOD Over  other buildings on campus with similar structures examined for safety PERIOD Anna Jurovich a junior nursing student who visits the gym regularly and is a member of different intramural teams explained that she was shocked to hear the news PERIOD Im just glad no one was hurt Jurovich said PERIOD I was really looking forward to the free GX classes this week but I guess theyll have to wait Jurovich humored PERIOD

Snow is being removed from the roofs of buildings that could pose a concern PERIOD As MSU heads into the future procedures for buildings and snow safety are being reevaluated PERIOD
