By  Jen BlandOctober  

Uh huh huh were like trickortreating or something PERIOD

If two metal heads with no handle on the English language show up at your door asking for candy dont be alarmed theyre harmless products of the MTV generation PERIOD

Or if an annoying musical purple dinosaur and his green crony show up at your door shove a candy bar in their mouths before they break out in song PERIOD I love you you love me  

You may even receive a visit from a genie promising to grant you three wishes PERIOD Dont believe it hand him a Snickers bar and wish him gone PERIOD When an Arabian boy and his monkey bang down your door be generous PERIOD

These are just a few of the characters that will be roaming the streets of DeKalb on Sunday night PERIOD Be sure to treat the children who visit your house or you may be tricked PERIOD

Some of the tricks played on stingy candygrubbing adults include smashed pumpkins egged cars and houses soapy windows and trees decorated with your favorite brand of toilet paper according to DeKalb Police Det PERIOD Bruce Borders PERIOD

But on a serious note Halloween too often turns dangerous for careless children and their parents PERIOD To help parents know what things to be wary of on old Hallows Eve the DeKalb Police Department has released a list of some safety tips PERIOD

These tips include a warning for drivers to be alert for excited trickortreaters who may run out into the street PERIOD

Also avoid flowing costumes that may catch fire look for flameretardant costumes wearing safe shoes carry a light rod or wearing reflective tape be careful with pointed toy weapons know the route your children are taking and who they will be with and especially childrenDO NOT EAT ANY CANDY BEFORE ITS CHECKED PERIOD

Kishwaukee Community Hospital wont be xraying candy but if parents suspect their childrens candy has been tampered with Borders said parents should call the police PERIOD

Cases of property damage seem to increase on Halloween but there wont be any extra police officers patrolling the streets Borders said PERIOD

Borders said there are no set times for children to go trickortreating but he would encourage everyone to finish by  p.m PERIOD

Another option open to eager Halloween aficionados is that the hospital will be having a Halloween Party from  p.m PERIOD Friday PERIOD

Colleen Paulsen a member of the committee sponsoring the party said there will be games refreshments a costume parade with prizes door prizes and a haunted house PERIOD

The parade procession will visit various floors of the hospital and prizes will be awarded to parade participants with the scariest cutest safest and best TV character costume PERIOD

The party is totally free but children must be accompanied by an adult PERIOD Paulsen said this is the seventh annual party sponsored by the hospital and attendance is increasing steadily PERIOD

Last year we had  childrenalmost one hundred more than the year before she said PERIOD This year were prepared to accommodate  children. paulsen said the party is healthy fun warm dry and safe. advertisement
