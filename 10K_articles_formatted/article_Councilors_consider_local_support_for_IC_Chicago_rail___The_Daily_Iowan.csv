7043,2021-03-13,"following Gov PERIOD Terry Branstads decision  to not allocate state funds at this time for an Iowa CityChicago passenger rail service Iowa City will likely need to come up with roughly  to make it happen PERIOD

Last week the Department of Transportation asked the City Council to authorize a letter to the Governors Office agreeing to consider local support for the operational costs of the railroad PERIOD

At Mondays City Council work session all the councilors supported the idea of looking into finding local financial support for the rail but they did not commit themselves to any set amount PERIOD

John Yapp a city transportation planner said Branstads office ordered the DOT to find local interest in supporting the plan PERIOD Iowa Citys projected  to  contribution is reasonable he said PERIOD

Thats actually a very good number compared with what it could have been Yapp said PERIOD

Though the rail service wouldnt be built for the next five to six years Councilor Connie Champion said she thinks the letter is a good idea PERIOD

Any letter that you write that encourages them to continue this would be great Champion told the DOT representatives PERIOD

The cost of the rail service is projected to be  million between Iowa and Illinois PERIOD Iowas cost is split among the state government the federal government and the local government PERIOD Illinois isnt planning on imposing costs on local governments for the rail PERIOD

This is typically a cost of the state said City Manager Tom Markus PERIOD However the governor has made it clear that its difficult to support the rail without local support. councilor Mike Wright also said he wants Iowa City to get the train and he supports looking into paying costs PERIOD

All the subsidies we give to cars and gas I wouldnt mind a little going to trains he said PERIOD

Iowa City as a host city for the rail would foot the bill for such operational costs as fuel and service depot fees PERIOD Communities the rail travels through would also contribute Yapp said PERIOD

The letter demonstrating local support is due at the DOT in March said Brad Neumann an assistant city transportation planner PERIOD

Markus said he supports the development of the rail because it will be a substantial investment in Iowa Citys downtown and to the university PERIOD

I think the return of this investment is substantially greater for our community and our general area he said PERIOD

According to the Iowa Connections fact sheet potential public and economic benefits of the rail range from job creation to pollution reduction to increased business activity PERIOD

The existing rail line only carries freight trains but with passenger train enhancements the train would travel at  mph possibly increasing to  mph in the future PERIOD

As a measure of austerity Branstad wants us to participate Markus said PERIOD",Councilors consider local support for IC-Chicago rail - The Daily Iowan,University of Iowa
