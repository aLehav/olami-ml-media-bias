It is also important to note that relief efforts across the campus are not exclusive to coalition members PERIOD Many clubs and groups have been organizing their own relief efforts PERIOD
While the service groups on campus universally desired to aid tsunami victims the idea for a coalition originated with CALPIRG the public interest and environmental student volunteer organization PERIOD
Jamie Dow the CALPIRG coordinator of the tsunami coalition explained the goals of the coalition PERIOD
The goal was just to provide communication between all the clubs that were working together and allow clubs access to resources they might not have by themselves Dow said PERIOD

The wavelength may still be kilometers when the wave hits the shore Primeau said PERIOD
Sadiq briefly summarized the role that politics will play for the region in the relief effort PERIOD In particular he highlighted the problems in divided areas like Aceh in Indonesia PERIOD
If you need a military to escort and distribute clothes and food youre going to have a logistical problem Sadiq said PERIOD Plus people see the guards behind the relief and become wary. furthermore Sadiq claimed that relief efforts can be sabotaged by government corruption PERIOD
If you give a billion dollars only  to  percent will reach the stricken areas he said PERIOD
After the panel students and professors moved outside for the vigil PERIOD Phung Pham vice president of UNICEF at UCI gave a short speech addressing students often competing responsibilities to their work and the world PERIOD
Were students encased in our own little bubbles too busy to pay attention to the problems that exist far far away from us problems that are too remote for us to give a second thought Pham said PERIOD But it is not until a tragedy of great magnitude comes along that we put things on hold and we pause to think seriously and carefully about this world. after a moment of silence the audiences attention was turned to a performance of a traditional South Indian dance known as Bharatanatyam performed by four UCI students Indu Kannan Nayani Vivekaandamorthy Henna Zaidi and Pallavi Devaraj PERIOD
The four have practiced the form for nine years and felt their performance would help students understand the cultural context of those afflicted by the tsunami PERIOD
