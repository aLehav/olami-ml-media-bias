Orioles manager Sam Perlozzo ends an argument with an umpire PERIOD Perlozzo was fired on Monday PERIOD Duane Burleson The Associated Press

By David Ginsburg June  

BALTIMORE  Four men have tried PERIOD No one has succeeded PERIOD Is anyone out there capable of having a winning season as manager of the Baltimore Orioles

Sam Perlozzo was fired by the Orioles on Monday the result of his inability to bring lastplace Baltimore out of a lengthy funk culminated by an eightgame losing streak PERIOD

We felt Sam was prepared we felt the club was prepared to do battle every night executive vice president Mike Flanagan said in a news conference PERIOD For whatever reason it just wasnt working. bullpen coach Dave Trembley will be the interim manager when the Orioles begin a sixgame trip in San Diego on Tuesday PERIOD One of the leading candidates to fill the position on a fulltime basis is Joe Girardi voted NL Manager of the Year in  with the Florida Marlins after he was fired in a dispute with ownership PERIOD

On another front the Orioles are negotiating with former Chicago Cubs president Andy MacPhail about becoming chief operating officer a job left vacant since Joe Foss resigned earlier this year PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

Since Davey Johnson guided the Orioles to a firstplace finish in  no one has been able to win in Baltimore PERIOD Ray Miller Mike Hargrove Lee Mazzilli and Perlozzo all failed and unless the Orioles pull off a surprising turnaround the teams franchiserecord run of losing seasons will reach  in  PERIOD

I dont know what the future holds for me with regard to my career Perlozzo said but I certainly hope to stay in the game that I have been a part of for so long.",Last-place Baltimore fires manager - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
