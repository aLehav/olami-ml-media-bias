I started playing music shortly after I started listening to music said Seth Hanson  PERIOD This singersongwriter and radio host has taken an independent direction in the development of his musical abilities PERIOD

Hanson started playing piano as a child PERIOD Since then he has developed his skills on the trombone and guitar PERIOD

Currently Hanson plays trombone for the Grinnell orchestra and hosts a radio show on KDIC PERIOD He also sings plays guitar and writes his own folk music PERIOD Hanson says he enjoys playing music that reflects his personal tastes on his radio show PERIOD

Ive got this vinyl collection and I like to sit down and play as many records as I can PERIOD Its nothing more than just me playing music that I like he said PERIOD Its a very broad range of music. hanson lists Grinnell and the experiences hes had here as one of the main influences on his music citing his sociology and philosophy classes as particularly influential PERIOD The most important aspect of his musical pursuits is writing his own folk music which he does under the name The Additional Six PERIOD Hanson sees creating music as an integral part of his personality PERIOD

Its just a part of me he said PERIOD Writing music just comes naturally to me PERIOD I dont know how I could take so much in and not be releasing something else. hanson finds the guitar a natural instrument to write music on due to its versatility PERIOD One of his main focuses when he writes is his lyrics which he usually crafts before his chords PERIOD He maintains that he always tries to push himself lyrically to uphold his own high standards lyrical goals he sets for himself PERIOD His favorite lyrics are generally complex PERIOD

I try not to write songs with singular meaning Hanson said PERIOD I try to avoid that unless its something I really care about PERIOD Part of why folk is appealing to me is that it allows the real focus to be on the lyrics. hanson performs at Freesound events open mics and for KDIC PERIOD In particular he enjoys playing at open mics because of the active Grinnell audience PERIOD

I like to catch peoples attention PERIOD Open mics are very well attended and wellrespected PERIOD Here at Grinnell people really listen PERIOD I put a lot of effort into the lyrics PERIOD I put a lot of effort into writing these things PERIOD When people listen its wonderful. future plans in the works for Hanson include a new album of songs written over the summer PERIOD The album focuses on positive themes such as bliss which Hanson says is a focus of the album PERIOD One of the songs on the upcoming album Whispered Tale is among his favorite original songs PERIOD He says that the song is significant to him and holds a personal meaning PERIOD His new album goes in a new direction for him and is more thematic than his previous music PERIOD The easy nature of folk music is one of the things he enjoys most about it PERIOD

I think its natural for one dude with a guitar to be playing folk music Hanson said PERIOD I like the simplicity of folk music. the Student News Site of Grinnell College
