Israels Genocidal War in Gaza What You Need to Know

Open Letter to former Macalester President Brian Rosenberg

As we seniors drag our collective knuckles towards graduation we are forced to wrap up the loose ends of our collegiate lives PERIOD The Honor Projects must be completed the major requirements must be fulfilled and the incriminating photos on Facebook must be erased before future employers see them PERIOD

One particularly stressful aspect of senior departure is that of the relationship PERIOD You love this person dearly and appreciate the unfathomable heights of ecstasy they bring to your genitals but sadly youre heading for Bangladesh to study international banking while heshe is headed to Canada to save those dumb dumb beavers PERIOD

So what to do Prove that love exists and remain together while separated by an entire ocean Or should you cherish the last moments of a glorious union with the knowledge that it is better to have loved than never at all

The answer dear friends is NEITHER Drop that sorry sack of organs and bones you call a significant other and get to fornicating

Just think about it You only have six weeks left to be a college student OH GOD THIS COULD BE YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO NAIL SOMEONE HOT JESUSHELL THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE TO DO

DONT YOU WANT TO HARPOON THE SALTY GERMAN TO ENVELOP THE FLESH BATON TO ORGIFY THE STUDENT BODY IN AN ORGYLIKE ORGY OF

Whew Got a little too excited there PERIOD No use wasting bodily fluids on myself when there are so many other people to do it on

Many of you in relationships are probably scoffing at my proposal right now PERIOD Scoff scoff PERIOD Well Mr PERIOD and Mrs PERIOD Scoffington I dare ask is your relationship really that well off Do you never fantasize about breaking up with your special manwomantranssexual and using your emotional distress to seduce that same manwomantranssexuals much hotter friend

The fact is youre in a relationship only because you have no excuse not to be PERIOD In a recent study of Minnesota college students in monogamous relationships  percent of those surveyed reported that theyve considered cheating on their partner  percent said theyd tried to break up with their partners at least once and a whopping  percent said they would if convinced they could get away with it murder their partners cash in their life insurance and use it to attract someone more attractive PERIOD

Just imagine a Macalester where everyone is single No sickening displays of public affection no depression once you discover your crush is already involved and best of all no regrets about drunken hookups lest they be with the ugly or diseaseridden

In the interest of full disclosure I must note I have a vested incentive in seeing my utopia come to fruition me being a single lonely shell of a human being and all PERIOD But do I not speak for the silent majority

Men Are you not tired of societys stranglehold on your sexual promiscuity Are you not tired of the world always telling you that you can only have sex one partner at a time

Heterosexual women Are you not frustrated that every attractive male is either taken gay or an egotistical prick who writes offensive articles in the student paper

With the end so close my fellow seniors I humbly ask Is your soul mate worth more than the sixweek orgasmswap that is the remainder of your collegiate life

I think the answer is pretty obvious PERIOD Oh dear God is it obvious
