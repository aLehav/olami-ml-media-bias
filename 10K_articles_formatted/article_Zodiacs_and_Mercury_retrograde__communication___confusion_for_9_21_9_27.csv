Hi everyone Andy here with the semesters third weekly horoscope This section gives general information for all signs such as the dates of each event PERIOD For the fullest reading experience please read this section first before skipping down to your sign PERIOD To learn how I write these horoscopes check out my explanatory column here PERIOD

On Sept PERIOD  the sun enters Libra PERIOD This time is known as Libra season and it stretches for the whole time that the sun is in Libra about one month PERIOD This is a great time to socialize meet new people and deepen your existing relationships PERIOD You may also feel more creatively inspired at this time PERIOD The most unique characteristics of Libra season are peace and harmony PERIOD Libra season brings compromise and conflict resolution as we are more inclined to examine perspectives other than our own PERIOD However this same perspective shift is also Libra seasons biggest challenge because we can become very indecisive PERIOD Libras seek fairness but not every issue has a clear and just solution PERIOD Libra season can also force us to yield our own desires just to restore peace PERIOD

At the very end of the week Mercury begins its retrograde period PERIOD A planetary retrograde is an optical illusion in which a planet looks as if it is moving backward PERIOD In the astrological sense planets each rule over an aspect of someones personality PERIOD When a planet is in a retrograde cycle their associated personality aspects may become more difficult to navigate PERIOD Mercury rules over communication and intelligence so the most notable effects of Mercury retrograde are forgetfulness misunderstandings and unclear communication PERIOD While this is generally a time of misfortune it pushes us to be more understanding of one another and put conscious effort into the clarity of our words PERIOD

Since both Mercury and the sun are in Libra these astrological events occur in the same houses for each sign PERIOD Because the suns ingress when a planet changes signs is typically positive and Mercury retrograde is usually negative this means they will push and pull at each other PERIOD It may be disorienting to feel incredibly disorganized and indecisive one day and extremely sociable and clear the next but at least its better than being unable to communicate PERIOD
