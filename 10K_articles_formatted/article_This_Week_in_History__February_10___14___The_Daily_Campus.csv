Nicknamed Claudius the Cruel the emperor was hated by his people specifically those living in the city of Rome PERIOD Hungry for war Claudius demanded that all ablebodied men serve in his army PERIOD Not wanting to risk their lives for a leader they had no faith in Roman men married and had children earlier to prevent being sent off to the frontlines PERIOD In response the emperor banned all new marriages and engagements within Rome a decree that did not go over well with the Roman people as you can imagine PERIOD

Valentine a holy priestof the newly formed Roman Catholic Church saw this injustice and defied the emperor by continuing to perform wedding ceremonies for young couples in secret thus beginning his connection to love and romance PERIOD When the emperor learned of his transgressions Valentine was imprisoned and sentenced to death by clubbing and decapitation PERIOD Legend has it before his execution on Feb PERIOD  he sent a farewell note to the prison guards daughter signing the card From Your Valentine. in  AD Pope Gelasius declared Feb PERIOD  as St PERIOD Valentines Day in honor of the saints tragic and untimely death PERIOD It is also believed however that Gelasius created the feast day of St PERIOD Valentine to stop the celebration of the pagan holiday Lupercalia PERIOD In Roman times the Feast of Lupercalia was the festival of love where all eligible bachelors and bachelorettes would pick a name from a box and celebrate the evening with whoever the lottery chose for them PERIOD Disgusted by this tradition Gelasius hoped the observance of a saints brutal murder would put an end to excessive love and affection on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD Wouldnt he be proud to see what his holiday has become today

Fast forward  years from St PERIOD Valentines execution another historic event occurred on Feb PERIOD  in  in Chicago TheSt PERIOD Valentines Day Massacre PERIOD In keeping with our theme of love and romance this brutal assault which resulted in the fatal shooting of seven people is the reason why America loves gangster movies and why everybody knows the name Al Capone PERIOD In 1920s Chicago organized crime ran rampant with the rise of bootlegging in Prohibitionera America PERIOD Crime bosses like Al Capone fought for control over the alcohol markets in major U.S PERIOD cities usually by murdering their rivals PERIOD

On Valentines Day  Capone disguised his henchmen as Chicago police officers to stop the whiskey deliveries of his archenemy George Bugs Moran PERIOD Capones men made Morans thugs stand against the wall in a line and proceeded to shower the alley with hundreds of bullets leaving sevenof Morans army dead in the street PERIOD Even though all of Chicago knew this was the work of Al Capone the police could not find enough evidence to convict him PERIOD Capone would go to jail two years later not on charge of murder or violating Prohibition but rather on tax evasion PERIOD Capone and the gangster lifestyle would become part of American culture when Hollywood got ahold of his story resulting in three movies based on his life in the1930s and the success of gangster films in the 1970s and beyond with The Godfather and Goodfellas to name a few PERIOD
