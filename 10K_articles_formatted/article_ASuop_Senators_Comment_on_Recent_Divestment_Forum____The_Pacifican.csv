Students Serving Students its an empowering statement PERIOD At ASuop everything we do is organized around this goal PERIOD We while being students ourselves work diligently to advocate for and support our constituents and our peers PERIOD For us Senators Marissa GandolfoGillaspy and Lorenzo Spaccarelli climate change and climate action are a key component of that support PERIOD As one of the most pressing global issues climate change threatens our collective future as young adults in  we live at the exact right time to witness the wanton destruction of our atmosphere and to see the consequences of those actions impact our lives in ever more devastating ways PERIOD Both of us believe that we cannot in good conscience claim to support students while overlooking this key issue PERIOD To that end we have advocated relentlessly for the university to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industries that are impacting us PERIOD

The story of this move towards divestment begins with Senator Emeritus Arshita Sandhiparthi  PERIOD During the  academic year Sandhiparthi pushed for the Sustainability Committee to take an active role in advocating for divestment and led the Committee through everything from meetings with the Regents to analyses of the universitys endowment PERIOD We learned that tens of millions of dollars are invested in fossil fuels supporting companies that are damaging the environment and risking our collective future PERIOD However all of this work was behind the scenes PERIOD This year Lorenzo and I made the decision to bring the issue to the attention of students in a big way PERIOD

While the Regents we spoke to always engaged in conversation and were willing to consider divesting they had not and still have not made a commitment to a divestment timeline PERIOD Lorenzo and I decided that perhaps the Regents would feel a greater sense of urgency and purpose if they realized that students truly believed in the critical importance of this issue PERIOD We concluded that the best way to engage with our peers on this issue would be if we hosted an event to inform students about the issue and demonstrate that the student body believed that action on this issue was critical PERIOD So on November fourth at 6pm we hosted a divestment forum for students to discuss divesting our university endowment from our sizable portfolio of fossil fuel companies PERIOD

Said forum was a collaboration between ourselves the Environmental Conservation Club ECC and Sustaining Pacific PERIOD The ECC is a student club organized around the protection of the environment both locally and broadly PERIOD Sustaining Pacific on the other hand is a university department dedicated to increasing the sustainability of what we do at Pacific PERIOD Representing the widely held belief among the student body that climate change is impacting and will have ever greater negative impacts on their future all three organizations believe that divestment by the university is a crucial first step to reducing said impacts PERIOD

The event was a remarkable success PERIOD The turnout was about thirty students a profound statement of interest in the part of the student body PERIOD Students spoke who represented such diverse groups as the Student Investment Fund and the ECC with our VP of Student Life also engaged in the conversation PERIOD We were even fortunate enough to have a guest speaker Miriam Eide a representative from Fossil Free California an organization dedicated to divesting the pension fund for California state employees from fossil fuel PERIOD We in ASuop are grateful to all of our speakers and especially to the students who showed up for the event PERIOD

ASuops work to push for divestment is just beginning PERIOD The Senate Sustainability Committee will maintain pressure on university leadership and the Board of Regents to make a commitment to moving forward on the issue PERIOD If the situation sees significant developments Lorenzo or I will communicate that to you as quickly as we can PERIOD However we can promise the student body this we will strive for a public divestment timeline by the end of the academic year PERIOD

The discussion about divestment and sustainability does not end here PERIOD We would love to hear from you as to your thoughts on this issue or on any sustainabilityrelated topic PERIOD Please feel free to contact me at mgandolfogillapsyu.pacific.edu or Lorenzo at lspaccarelliu.pacific.edu
