Protests and riots rocked the country last week after a grand jury refused to indict Darren Wilson the officer who shot Mike Brown in Ferguson Missouri PERIOD Continuing the disturbing trend of police violence this year an Ohio cop shot and killed 12yearold Tamir Rice PERIOD Apparently they believed the toy gun the boy had was a real one even though the  dispatcher told them it was probably a fake weapon PERIOD

Make no mistake police brutality and excessive use of force is becoming a serious systemic problem in our society and something must be done about it PERIOD

One of the best ways to combat this social illness is in both my estimation and the estimation of Mike Browns family to issue every officer a body camera which must be on and recording the entire time theyre on duty and cant be turned off or removed PERIOD

With this method every interaction between officers and the public is easily viewable by an officers superiors and if necessary a courtroom PERIOD It also encourages officers to be on their best behavior while dealing with everyday citizens PERIOD This isnt just my guessing because its been observed to work PERIOD

In California officers have started wearing cameras and the number of reports of abuse by officers has gone down along with incidents of force being used by officers PERIOD

Our police force right here in Harrisonburg is already asking for an increase in their budget in order to get cameras for their uniforms PERIOD

Cops recognize that these cameras dont just protect citizens they protect the cops themselves PERIOD

In the event that a person fabricates a report of police brutality the cameras footage can be used to exonerate the officer PERIOD

If we know this can work then we need to start implementing this on every police force in the country PERIOD Overt police brutality and violence needs to stop and stop now PERIOD We cant keep allowing people to kill without any accountability at all PERIOD We need change and it cant come soon enough PERIOD
