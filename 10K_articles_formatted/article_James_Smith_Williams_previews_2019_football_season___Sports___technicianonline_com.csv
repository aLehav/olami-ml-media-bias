During ACC Football Media Day at the Westin Hotel in Charlotte graduate defensive end James SmithWilliams sat down with the media to talk about the upcoming season his journey through the program his role as a leader and much more PERIOD Here are some of the highlights from his interviews

On recent legislation allowing alcohol sales at CarterFinley

I cant say too much about it because Ill be playing while theyre drinking but I think it will help us have a rowdier crowd and we love that as players PERIOD Im excited for it. on his relationship with redshirt senior defensive lineman Larrell Murchison

I love him PERIOD Hes a great football player hes a great guy PERIOD Weve grown very close PERIOD I would say that every day he does something new Ill do something new PERIOD Were trying to copy each other or teach something that we learned PERIOD Its helped us both grow PERIOD He pushes me to get better and I push him to do the same PERIOD At the end of the day we love each other PERIOD Hes my brother and I know no matter what happens he has my back and I have his so Im excited PERIOD Im excited to play with him. on being chosen to wear the coveted number one jersey

Its really exciting PERIOD When you look at the guys that wore number one before me the Jaylen Samuels Steph Louises those are guys that are really respected in the program so its kind of a blessing to be seen the same way they were. on his position changes and positional flexibility

I actually played safety entering NC State I played nickel PERIOD I think I can do everything on the field PERIOD I have the speed to play everything else PERIOD I think where it really comes in handy is Ive played every position group on the field so I know what the secondary sees I know what the linebackers see PERIOD That translates over to me playing defensive end because I know what to expect I know what to see. on former NC State players he feels a comparison to

Ill say a hybrid a lighter Kentavious Street and Bradley Chubb is a comparison Ive been drawing pretty often just because the nature of the positions weve been playing is the same. on balancing his passion for professional life off the field with football

I think one enhances the other PERIOD I dont think its a battle between Am I going to work at IBM or am I going to play football I want to play football thats what I want to do PERIOD I think you should put yourself in a position to succeed no matter what it is PERIOD Thats why I pushed for an internship at IBM why I pushed to do well when I worked there and why I love the job offer because it gives you other options if football doesnt work out PERIOD But in the same breath things from football roll over the traits the hard work the dedication that goes into work and then in the same breath working there teaches me things on the field like new ways to approach things PERIOD So I think it goes handinhand. on head coach Dave Doerens impact on himself

I think coach Doeren has a standard and that standard is raised every day PERIOD He set the bar high PERIOD Hes shown us also what its like to be a man handle your business PERIOD I think thats reflected on the field as well  He sat me down when I was a freshman and you know I was a freshman I didnt make the most sound decisions in the world and he said Hey what are your goals Write them down PERIOD What do you want to accomplish What do you want to do here And what I wrote down is what Im trying to live out now PERIOD Those things that I wrote down are what matter most to me. on whether this season is a rebuilding or reloading year

I think our take now is that we reload at NC State PERIOD I dont think there is ever a rebuilding year PERIOD Weve been getting guys from recruiting classes that are great guys that you guys havent seen yet but Ive practiced with so I know what they can do PERIOD I see a lot of the traits roll over like former wide receiver Kelvin Harmon does this well now Im seeing junior wide receiver Emeka Emezie do it PERIOD From top to bottom everyone just keeps growing and keeps building PERIOD
