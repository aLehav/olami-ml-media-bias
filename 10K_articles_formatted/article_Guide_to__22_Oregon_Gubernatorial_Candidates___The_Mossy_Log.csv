The  gubernatorial election is being held on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD In addition to congressional candidates statewide offices judges of various bodies and a handful of measures there will be three competitive mayoral candidates PERIOD

Betsy Johnson is an independent candidate unaffiliated with any party and an alum of the Lewis  Clark Law School PERIOD Her primary goals are managing Portlands homeless and public safety crisis improving public schools making Oregon more affordable legislatively supporting jobs and job creators more holding the government accountable and ending state COVID19 mandates for businesses schools and government workers PERIOD

She is very critical of Governor Kate Brown Mayor Ted Wheeler and opponent Tina Koteks performances PERIOD

Oregon is headed in the wrong direction Johnson said PERIOD We have turned the southern part of the state into cartelrun drug land. johnson the best funded candidate in the race has served in the Oregon State Legislature for more than  years her most recent position being Joint Ways and Means Committee Chair PERIOD

Johnson takes her independence from being an advocate for bipartisanship and said that it does not matter whether you voted for Joe Biden or Donald Trump her only allegiance is to the state of Oregon PERIOD

Johnson said that the burden of fighting against global warming should not fall on rural Oregon PERIOD She has an A rating with National Rifle Association NRA PERIOD With the help of some Portlanders she turned an abandoned jail into housing for unhoused people and plans to continue this crusade PERIOD She is willing to expand developable land for housing and commerce but she is not willing to take forest or farmland PERIOD Lastly she thinks it is important for the future of the state of Oregon that it is recognized that mentally ill and drugaddicted people do not make good decisions for themselves PERIOD

Christine Drazen the Republican candidate began her portion of the  gubernatorial debate with a question PERIOD

Are you happy with the way that things are going Drazen said PERIOD Is your family better off is your community better off today than it was four years ago or eight years ago Now that you have heard from my opponents on the stage they are the status quo. drazen favors a new direction stronger schools crime reduction and affordable housing PERIOD Similarly to Johnson she has an A rating with the NRA PERIOD

Drazen says that Oregon should declare a homelessness state of emergency and that climate protection should not be prioritized when housing is a necessity PERIOD Two years earlier Tina Kotek proposed that the same measure be instated PERIOD

Drazens plan for the housing crisis is connected to her plan for increased policing and recriminalizing drugs PERIOD She is in support of building more structures but is in favor of loosening regulations on developers to do so PERIOD

Drazen claimed that due to Governor Kate Browns vote to close schools during the pandemic children suffered the most PERIOD She says that state politics are different from national politics and has not sought President Donald Trumps support of her campaign but was against his impeachment PERIOD She is prolife but believes in equal pay and says that companies should be liable to prove it PERIOD

Drazen was elected to the Oregon State House of Representatives in  and served as the minority leader from  to  PERIOD During her tenure and well before it Tina Kotek was the house speaker the first out lesbian in her position PERIOD She started in  and stepped down similarly in  to run for governor PERIOD

A lot of Oregonians are struggling right now and we have real challenges facing us Kotek said PERIOD We have a housing and homelessness crisis an addiction and overdose epidemic threats to our very democracy here in our state. homelessness is a significant issue for the state and each candidate has been able to recognize it PERIOD Similarly to Johnson Koteks focus is on building more housing PERIOD She has already brought . billion to increased housing in the past  years PERIOD Kotek also hopes to protect those on the brink of homelessness and make race a less predictive indicator of homelessness PERIOD

In contrast to the other candidates she mentions an upward trend in gun violence and how she has lobbied for expanded background checks safe storage laws and commonsense gun legislation PERIOD On Aug PERIOD  Donald Ray Surrett Jr PERIOD and Glen Edward Bennett were killed in a Bend Safeway parking lot by a  yearold shooter who then took his own life PERIOD Kotek cites this incident during the gubernatorial debate and suggests a change in purchasing age from  to  PERIOD

Koteks additional priorities include curbing climate change supporting veterans protecting Oregon from wildfires supporting racial justice improving education and childcare and supporting mentally ill people PERIOD She would like to reform campaign finance so that less money can come from a single source PERIOD Kotek would also like to provide economic opportunity to working families and protect womens reproductive rights PERIOD

All three candidates fit pretty cleanly with the morals of their platforms of their party but defining candidates by party spares the voter from investigating further PERIOD This can be a harmful philosophy as most want those voting differently to do just that PERIOD

Additionally despite the clear party lines this is not a typical race by historical standards as all three candidates are women PERIOD Oregon politics are no longer a boys club and this election is ensuring that PERIOD Lastly in the majority of polls Christine Drazen is leading by a slim margin PERIOD Although the accuracy of preelection polls is questionable she could become the first Republican Governor of Oregon since Vic Atiyeh in the 1980s PERIOD
