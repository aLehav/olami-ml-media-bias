8887,2016-12-01,"sitting in the Starbucks a mile away from campus in Springfield on a Saturday afternoon I sit enjoying my coffee as I think of how much work I am getting done and take mental notes of what I still have left to do PERIOD In a matter of a few hours of being separated from the stress of Swarthmore I have already finished my lab report and can begin writing my research paper before the sun sets and I head back to campus PERIOD I am in my element in work mode and nothing can stop me from finishing my homework now PERIOD
That is the case until a man who has been sitting in the chair next to me for the last few hours interrupts me to ask if he can share an outlet PERIOD Of course I move over so that he can plug in his phone but the conversation doesnt end there PERIOD He begins asking me questions about the Swarthmore area and how long I have been in the Philadelphia region PERIOD It becomes evident to me that he has no idea that Swarthmore College even exists let alone how selective and intensive its education is PERIOD 
Somehow and I have no idea how we begin conversing about his life and how he just moved to Swarthmore to live with his sister after leaving behind gangs drugs and discrimination in Chester PERIOD I learn how he is in the process of turning his life around after involvement in some serious drug crimes which have been difficult for him to escape PERIOD He explains in great detail his encounters with the police and how it would be impossible for him to ever return home PERIOD He claims Chester was not for him and he would never want to return PERIOD 
As I mostly listen and nod during his stories Im not sure if I should feel uncomfortable or if I should feel guilty for feeling uncomfortable PERIOD Despite my slight distress when I glance at the time on my laptop I notice that I have spent almost two hours engrossed in this mans life stories PERIOD Before it gets too dark I close my laptop with the barely started research paper I had hoped to make progress on and dismiss myself from the conversation PERIOD 
Despite my unfinished paper and my unease I have no regrets as I walk away from the discussion reminded of the world outside Swarthmore that is more than just academics or writing papers PERIOD I am reminded that Swarthmore is a beautiful ivory tower of knowledge that it is truly educating us with the hope of molding us into change agents PERIOD However it is still a college of the elite and that means that it alone cannot provide the resources necessary for understanding and effectively changing the world around us PERIOD 
Walking back to campus I think of the many other instances that I have been overwhelmed by the Swat bubble not only how real it is but also how dangerous it can be PERIOD I think of the time my friends and I took an Uber back to campus and the driver from Delaware seemed awestruck that people actually lived in such a scene of nature PERIOD I think of how wedding parties come to get their pictures taken in front of the bell tower implying a surreal and magical quality of the campus that we have grown accustomed to and easily take for granted PERIOD 
Perhaps most disheartening I think of how some students have never even been into Philly and how many of us dont leave campus more than a few times a semester much less engage with the real world on a regular basis PERIOD Suddenly I am saddened PERIOD As a student body by separating ourselves from the real world we are allowing ourselves to forget the privilege of even attending college much less an institution as rigorous as Swarthmore PERIOD Yet more dangerous is the fact that we are also creating an illusion of society based on readings rather than actually engaging with the real world PERIOD Through interpreting the world based solely on readings news articles and our daily experiences at Swarthmore we as students are failing to immerse ourselves in understanding and interacting with the communities that we are hoping to impact PERIOD As a result we are setting ourselves up to remain separated from the reality of problems in society and to implement mediocre solutions based on theory instead of knowledge and experience PERIOD
Dont get me wrong PERIOD I am grateful that Swarthmore provides an inclusive environment that is determined to nurture students and that provides a safe haven from some of the very real hardships within society it allows our academics to be so successful as we are able to focus solely on feeding our minds rather than dealing with problems that could impair us PERIOD 
However if we are ever truly going to implement successful solutions to the problems of society we as students need to branch out of the serenity of the Swat bubble every once in awhile and expose ourselves to communities and the very real conflicts that many people face PERIOD As students it is our job to embrace the whole world around us beyond just academic perfection in order to remember our potential to make a difference and form successful solutions to world problems both now and in the future PERIOD Even in our world of academic perfection we need to remember that despite our ivory tower we are not just students we are still members of society with a social responsibility PERIOD
