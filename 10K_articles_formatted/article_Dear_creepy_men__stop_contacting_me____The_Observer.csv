Ashton Weber  Tuesday October  

You look great on CNN. i am a lawyer and winery owner just so you have some idea of the person who writes you out of the blue not sure if it gives my name on the message I sent PERIOD Insert Name. two Fridays ago I was interviewed on CNN PERIOD A few minutes before the hit time I hid my phone to avoid distraction and as soon as I signed off of the streaming platform I retrieved my phone from its hiding place baffled to see it blowing up PERIOD I quickly clicked on one of the incoming notifications and started to understand what was happening PERIOD

I had been found PERIOD I guess there arent many Ashton Webers in the world and Im a pretty vocal one on the internet PERIOD After seeing me speak on TV for less than  seconds over  people tried to add me on Facebook Instagram and Twitter PERIOD Some of them appeared to be kind and congratulatory but most of them were older men who accompanied their follow requests with messages that sexualized me and established their relative positions of power see some of the messages above PERIOD

To say I was freaked out is an understatement PERIOD Although Ive received creepy messages on the internet before its never happened to this magnitude and its never been from people who had previously seen me most of the strangers who try to follow me on social media are sugar daddy bots PERIOD So even though this wasnt an unfamiliar occurrence it was an incredibly uncomfortable one made distinct by the fact that these people not only saw and decided to find me but that they then concluded it would be appropriate to contact me and comment on my appearance PERIOD

This isnt to say that no one should ever contact me on social media again PERIOD Ive loved previous responses to columns and its been touching to see that my words resonate with people PERIOD Im rarely able to respond to emails that people send me but I still appreciate them deeply especially those that thoughtfully respond to the things Im saying PERIOD Theres nothing cooler than knowing that people are engaging with the things youve worked hard to tell them PERIOD

Perhaps thats why this whole occurrence bothered me so much PERIOD Its not just that random men tried to follow me and wanted me to know they think Im attractive PERIOD Its also that my argument wasnt given respect and was instead reduced to a reflection of my image PERIOD

In my introduction to gender studies course this semester weve been discussing a concept called the mythical norm PERIOD Originally coined by Audre Lorde it essentially means that theres a perceived normal in each society and those who fit it wield the most privilege over those who dont PERIOD In the United States the mythical norm is widely recognized as white cisgender heterosexual male Christian and financially stable PERIOD Those who dont fit this norm are marked as other and their value is determined by how useful they are to those who are mythically normal PERIOD

Cool Ashton but how does this have anything to do with your being perceived by random men Upon first glance I appear to be mythically normal except for my femaleness PERIOD In say a threeminute CNN clip theres not much you can understand about a person beyond things you might ascertain from a first glance PERIOD This means that right off the bat I was marked by femaleness PERIOD A majority of the responses I received came from men who appeared to match the mythical norm and referenced superficial things like my physical appearance or composure PERIOD As I mentioned earlier they also sent me information that established a weird power dynamic PERIOD Thank you for thinking I sound smart but why do I need to know what you do for a living Why do I need to know where you live and work Honestly why would I even need to know that you think I looked composed and sounded eloquent If your reflections have little to do with what Im saying and more to do with how I said it why do you feel the need to relay them to me

I shared my creepedoutedness with a few friends who have also made public comments and they remarked that they had also received random messages and follow requests PERIOD I started to wonder how often this same phenomenon happens PERIOD The news cycle runs  and people are interviewed all the time so how many other women have received a you looked amazing on CNN message and hundreds of friend requests

Beyond just the news how does this same occurrence play out in other scenarios How many times a day do women or people who defy the mythical norm in other ways give statements on things they care about only to be told they sound surprisingly intelligent or that they look hot How much worse do the messages and objectification get when someone is mythically abnormal in multiple ways

I think the biggest thing I want to say in this column is that its important to think more intentionally about the ways were interacting with others PERIOD There have been multiple times when Ive reduced people to superficial characteristics instead of listening to what theyre saying in the fullest PERIOD On several occasions Ive considered myself first when responding to others instead of giving full attention to what theyre saying PERIOD I would invite everyone to join me in thinking about the positions of privilege we find ourselves in and actively considering how they shape our interactions with other people PERIOD I also want to say Please stop responding superficially to people especially people who are working and thinking long and hard about how to say important things PERIOD We dont care if you think we sound intelligent or if you own a winery PERIOD We only care that youre actually hearing what we have to say PERIOD
