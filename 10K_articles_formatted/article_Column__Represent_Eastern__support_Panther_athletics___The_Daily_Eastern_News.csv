This column originally was printed in the Monday Dec PERIOD  edition of The Daily Eastern News
As a senior its hard to believe that my time with The Daily Eastern News is over PERIOD Ive had a great time covering several of the universitys teams especially during this years football season PERIOD But as I reflect on those memories the more I realize that not everything reached my expectations especially on November  when Eastern hosted No PERIOD  ranked Jacksonville State PERIOD

It was a battle of two unbeaten Ohio Valley Conference teams but the attendance failed to indicate the games importance PERIOD The Panthers took the field in front of a crowd of over  in the 10000seat OBrien Field PERIOD Even with the history the program has  former and current NFL players and five conference championships since  theyve not been able to attract attention like a winning team should PERIOD Parking lot tailgaters seem to outnumber those that actually go into the stadium to watch the games PERIOD But how is it that FCS teams like North Dakota State and Montana are able to attract more fans to their games

Its simple there arent many teams to compete with for viewership PERIOD Montana led the nation in attendance last year with  because there is only one other Division  college football team in the state their rivals Montana State PERIOD Add that and the fact that the Grizzlies have played in seven national championships and won two of them its obvious that their success has attracted a large following of fans PERIOD North Dakota State which is honestly in the middle of nowhere continues to have a national championship caliber team every year PERIOD That and the fact that the Bisons play inside a dome a rare site for college football garners interest for the program PERIOD

While Eastern has been solid on the gridiron and produced NFL talent the fan base throughout the area remains mostly vested in FBS programs which have their games televised every weekend PERIOD Not many FCS teams can say that PERIOD The only way to follow them weektoweek is to watch the games streaming online which isnt legal in some places or listen on the radio PERIOD Eastern has been fortunate enough to have all games shown on the OVC Digital Network but attendance has not been big enough for an annually good team PERIOD OBrien is not the largest stadium in the FCS but the fact that they cant get at least  fans for a game especially one against the No PERIOD  team in the country is embarrassing PERIOD

But maybe the state of the facility does not garner enough interest PERIOD As I covered the team this year a couple of players mentioned throughout the year that they liked playing at OBrien but would like it to be bigger PERIOD One suggested that they could add bleachers surrounding the entire stadium PERIOD OBrien last went through renovations in  which added an expanded weight room coaches offices and new locker rooms PERIOD You only need to look at how the states financial crises is affecting the university to know that most likely wont happen in the near future PERIOD There is only one way to promote Eastern football and its the same method that schools through the country use history lessons PERIOD

Remind everybody about all the professional players that played on that field especially Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo PERIOD How many other FCS schools can say that a former player has started for an NFL team in the last  years Theres also coaches that have become part of Eastern lore PERIOD Former head coach Bob Spoo won  games in  years and was inducted into the OVC Hall of Fame following his retirement in  PERIOD His successor Dino Babers recently named head coach at Syracuse won a pair of OVC titles in his two years with the Panthers which were led by Walter Payton Award winner quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo PERIOD We were proud that year and it resulted in ESPN feature the university on its weekly programs PERIOD That shows that our support means something PERIOD

Every fall Saturday when I walk past the entrance to OBrien I always look up at the pictures of the EIU greats that excelled in the pros PERIOD My family always reminds me how lucky I am of a few things every week going to a great university being part of a national recognized collegiate newspaper and being part of a small school thats produced professional talent including both athletics and academics PERIOD My sister who attended the University of Illinois even admits our programs compete harder than the Fighting Illini in some sports PERIOD Now as I go into my final week Im spreading that same message PERIOD

Be proud of your Panthers and all that they accomplish because most of the country does not notice them PERIOD Every home game lead them to victory with your passion and support PERIOD Show the nation not just the OVC and the area that what makes us different is ourselves PERIOD When the television sets show Eastern athletics and its community at its greatest the nation will finally know PERIOD The size of your facilities and campus does not define your school the people who represent it do PERIOD On a fall Saturday or a basketball game against Murray State Belmont or Southeast Missouri let it be known that this is what we call home PERIOD Its in Charleston PERIOD
