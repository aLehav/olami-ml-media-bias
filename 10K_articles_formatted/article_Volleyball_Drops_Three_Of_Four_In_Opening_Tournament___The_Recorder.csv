Central Connecticuts volleyball team did not get the results they were looking for in the Jack Kaiser Volleyball Classic over the weekend losing in three of their four games PERIOD

In their first match of the season the opposing Eastern Michigan Eagles were able to defeat the Blue Devils in straight sets securing a  victory PERIOD The Eagles took over from the start of the match putting up an early  lead PERIOD Central went on a late run to bring it to 1814before Eastern Michigan would close out the set  PERIOD

The second set would prove to be more of the same as the Eagles opened up with a  run and would end the set with a  run to take a  win PERIOD

The matchs third set started off unlike the rest with back and forth scoring between the teams until the Eagles could go on yet another run that ultimately led to a  win of the set and sweep of the match PERIOD

Last years breakout star for Central junior Madelyn Kaprelyan showcased more of her skills in this match posting a teamhigh seven kills to go along with senior Katelyn Kushmans twelve digs which also led the team PERIOD

In the second game of the day the Blue Devils looked to bounce back against the St PERIOD Johns Red Storm the host of the tournament PERIOD

The Red Storm overcame Central in the first set winning  in quick fashion PERIOD The Blue Devils would retaliate during the second set and go on a quick  run before sophomore outside hitter Emma Henderson would score on an ace to seal a Central win  PERIOD

The Blue Devils showcased more dominance in the third set taking an early  lead and finishing the set with a  victory after another kill by Kaprelyan PERIOD

The fourth set in the match proved to be an exciting one as the teams battled closely throughout PERIOD Central was able to tie the matchup at  a piece but the Red Storm stayed alive by just barely taking the set  PERIOD

The fifth and final set went in similar fashion to the fourth a barn burner by both sides PERIOD After a kill by Kaprelyan Central was only trailing  PERIOD The Red Storm would close the gap on to straight scores to win the final set and match of the day  PERIOD

Senior outside hitter Rachel Quirarte shined for the Blue Devils in the toughfought match adding in  kills and  digs PERIOD Sophomore Ashlyn Eisenga led the team with  digs while junior Erin McDermott held an impressive teamhigh  assists PERIOD

For the second day of the tournament Central looked to erase the memories of the day prior against opponents Manhattan and Fordham PERIOD

Central opened up Saturday with afire ignited in them from their two losses on Friday PERIOD They were able to break a  tie late in the first set after another clutch kill by Kaprelyan that started a  run that led to the victory PERIOD

The second set was more of the same from Central who led throughout the set and won in an easy  fashion PERIOD

Struggles during the third set left Central trailing  to Manhattan early PERIOD The Blue Devils rallied to tie the game at  by way of a Kushman kill PERIOD Central never looked back after tying the game sitting in the lead until backtoback blocks won the set and match  securing the first win of the Blue Devils season PERIOD

Central looked for similar results in their second game against the Fordham Rams PERIOD Blue Devils volleyball would take the first set after multiple errors by the Rams and finish the game with  PERIOD Despite holding a late  lead during the second set Fordham would score four straight to take the second set PERIOD

After a quick third set that saw Fordham win  a crucial fourth set for the Blue Devils turned back a quick game of back and forth PERIOD A Kaprelyan kill would tie the game at  but Central could not answer following two straight scores from the Rams dropping the closelycontested set  and lost the match  PERIOD

Central will look to improve from their tournament weekend with a match at Hartford on Aug PERIOD  PERIOD
