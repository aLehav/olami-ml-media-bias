Atypical college quad is filled with students proudly donning sweatshirts and baseball caps with the schools name and colors PERIOD This isnt the case at NYU where our quad is a public park and most students wouldnt be caught wearing NYU apparel to class PERIOD Recently the NYU bookstore set out tochange this PERIOD

Located at  Broadway the store is both central to campus and receives heavy tourist traffic PERIOD The store attracts alumni tourists and of course current students PERIOD Rochelle Kemp Buyer of Apparel at the NYU Bookstore has been with the store for over  months PERIOD In that time sales have increased by almost  PERIOD Clearly there is a market and students are a part of the target audience PERIOD So why dont we see more violet on campus

Many students have expressed concerns regarding the price points of the NYU bookstore PERIOD However the NYU bookstore understands the economic burdens of students and has been making efforts to offer lower cost items that are still top quality PERIOD

I definitely want to take away the perception that everything in this store is expensive PERIOD Since Ive gotten here I have tailored the buying process to the good better best strategy PERIOD We have shirts from . up to  and I dont water down the . shirt Kemp said PERIOD

Regardless of the bookstores efforts to make products more affordable there is still an apparent lack of students sporting NYU gear around campus PERIOD It seems many students who do own the apparel wear it exclusively when they are not in Manhattan PERIOD At NYU students strive to be in and of the city rather than to stand out in their purple letters PERIOD

Outside NYC Im bragging to say Im an NYU student PERIOD In the city Im demoting myself from being a real New Yorker LS sophomore Whitt Van Tassell said PERIOD

Some students reserve their NYU attire for exercise PERIOD

I wear NYU gear to go to yoga and work out in PERIOD I am the type of person where I like to dress up to class or to work so the only time I would ever really wear a tshirt with NYU on it would be to break a sweat CAS junior Emily Harris said PERIOD

Just as you will never see a student wearing leggings as pants or Uggs for shoes you will not see students in their spirit wear because NYU students pride themselves on their personal sartorial choices PERIOD It is not that NYU students dont have school pride PERIOD Instead they embrace the schools spirit of individuality by creating their own sense of style as
New Yorkers PERIOD

The NYU Bookstore has made significant strides to elevate its look hoping to attract the students who want to uphold a certain level of style and dont want to wear the typical college gear PERIOD Woolly Threads and League are two brands that offer vintage collegiate designs PERIOD Other new styles offer subtle NYU logos hidden on various parts of the garment PERIOD

This style upgrade can be attributed to the collaborative buying process PERIOD Kemp said she feels it is very important to have a youthful eye weighing in and to ask students for their opinions PERIOD The bookstore also recently brought in nonNYU branded products such as Happy Socks and Fjallraven backpacks in hopes of attracting more student customers with products that arent stamped with the NYU logo PERIOD

Perhaps the NYU Bookstores more affordable prices and upgrade in style will get more NYU students to deck themselves out in spirit wear PERIOD Regardless of the stores success NYU students dont necessarily have to wear their pride on their sleeve to know they have it PERIOD
