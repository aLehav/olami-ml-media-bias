Three years have passed since the Universitys Public Safety Department first acquired its current radio system PERIOD It is the same system that has been the target of complaints from officers since it was adapted PERIOD

Problems with the current system include an inability to report to police dispatch and deadspots throughout both campuses including areas around the Ernest Graham Center and Primera Casa building at the Modesto Maidique Campus along with areas around the Wolfe University Center and the Library at the Biscayne Bay Campus PERIOD

We did surveys and tests around the campus and we found that there are dead spots within our University with the county radio PERIOD Now and again youll find spots where your frequency isnt picked up as clearly said University Chief of Police Bill King PERIOD

King says that improvements have been and are continuing to be made PERIOD

He said that the most recent issue the radio system faced came last month after lightning struck one of the repeaters PERIOD

We did lose coverage North at Biscayne Bay PERIOD That repeater was then replaced and we havent had any more issues with that PERIOD Now and again we do have some issues with disruptions but again I feel that those are not anything uncommon that a number of departments and agencies have with radio systems King said PERIOD

In a  interview with The Beacon King explained that coverage on campus had been made better by adjusting repeaters and the antennas for the system PERIOD He also acknowledged that there were still dead spots in the system PERIOD

The system we have is an adequate system PERIOD Is it the best system Absolutely not PERIOD Is it the worst Absolutely not PERIOD Do we have problems with it now and again Yes PERIOD Will we continue to have problems with it now and again I would say fewer and fewer as time goes by PERIOD Every time we have something that occurs we end up addressing that as an issue King said in a recent interview PERIOD

The system manufactured by Motorola Radios is an ultrahigh frequency system strictly for University use replacing an older state communications system PERIOD It is not the traditional countywide radio system which most law enforcement departments use PERIOD

King also went on to say that the department has purchased several handheld county radios allowing both the dispatch center and officer to keep track of the county system and allowing them to communicate with them if needed PERIOD

The current system is still unreliable said Brenan Coyle of the Dade County Police Benevolent Association

Coyle is staff counsel for the Dade County PBA which has been receiving complaints from officers about the radio system since  PERIOD

According to Coyle he has been receiving emails about the issue and has gotten complaints as recently as within the last month PERIOD

The improvements have been marginal at best Coyle said in a recent interview with The Beacon PERIOD

In  when discussions were held to determine which system the department would adopt there were three leading options adopting the county radio system upgrading the state communications system or reverting to the UHF system and buying new radios PERIOD

Initial estimates for the cost of converting to the UHF system were  PERIOD  The department spent  on the system as of December  including hiring firms such as Code  Technology and Rapid Wireless of Florida to help improve the system PERIOD

The countywide radio system was projected to cost over  at the time though later estimates claimed that the system would have cost  PERIOD

The Union endorses and still endorses the county system which is the best system for the University and its officers Coyle said PERIOD

At the time this article was published King has not replied to multiple contact attempts from Student Media regarding this issue PERIOD

Officer safety and the safety of the University community has not be jeopardized by our current radio system nor will it be because we do have some redundancy in our communications system King said PERIOD
