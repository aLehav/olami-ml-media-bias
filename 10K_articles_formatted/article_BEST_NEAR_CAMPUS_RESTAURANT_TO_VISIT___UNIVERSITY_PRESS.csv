By all accounts Campus Bistro should be the quintessential FAU sandwich shop PERIOD Their scrumptious greasesoaked Philly steak and cheese is called a Graduate. a grilled chicken with melted provolone sub is labeled an Undergrad. the penne pasta smothered in marinara and shaved Parmesan is surprisingly dubbed an Exchange Student. but ironically this lunch hideaway isnt a campus staple at all PERIOD In fact its a clear halfmile north of the Boca campus unassumingly tucked away inside the heart of FAUs Research and Development Park PERIOD

Yet despite being a prime location for ravenous corporate businesspeople the store manager is set on luring back the college crowd PERIOD Campus Bistros first order of business cheaper eats PERIOD FAU students now get a dollar off any  or more purchase PERIOD

We recommend healthsavvy students first zero in on the Tuscan Salad . roast chicken over a bed of romaine lettuce mixed greens and hearty steamed veggies PERIOD If that wets your whistle drop by the following day for a Freshman . a grilled beef burger sub blackened welldone and crowned with mounds of portobello mushrooms onions cheese and bacon PERIOD

We take it back  Campus Bistro is the quintessential sandwich shop PERIOD
