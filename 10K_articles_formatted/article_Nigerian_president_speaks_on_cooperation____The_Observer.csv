Meghan Martin  Monday September  

African television stations broadcast live Sunday evening from the Joyce Center for Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo keynote speech for the Institute for Church Lifes A Call to Solidarity with Africa conference PERIOD

The president who entered the Joyce Center on a red carpet followed by an entourage of bodyguards and U PERIOD S PERIOD Secret Service agents discussed current economic and political conditions in Africa and called upon the United States and its western allies to keep the issues of his continent at the forefront of international conversation PERIOD

This weeks conference which has brought together scholars relief workers students and religious groups from all over the world is a step toward achieving that goal he said PERIOD

These are difficult days for Africa he said PERIOD Thus whenever an opportunity like this presents itself  we try not to let it slip through our fingers PERIOD We wholeheartedly support the efforts of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops the University of Notre Dame  and all the people who have made this conference happen PERIOD  It marks the historic moment of the Catholic Church in the United States working together with its counterparts in Nigeria. the document of the same name issued in  by the U.S PERIOD Conference of Catholic Bishops sparked the idea for this weeks conference Obasanjo said and referred directly to the issue of slavery and its role in building the United States PERIOD He quoted the documents claim that the United States has a clear moral duty on the matter and took the bishops claim a step further PERIOD

While the evil institution of slavery  played a significant role in the development of the United States it played a significant role in the undevelopment of the continent of Africa  thus making the United States obligation a double one he said PERIOD

While he held the United States partially responsible for the current situation in Africa Obasanjo said that the continents leaders have become particularly invested in reshaping Africa from the inside out PERIOD

We are determined to be the actors of our own fortune he said PERIOD For instance the majority of African countries have chosen the democratic institution PERIOD  In the last three months we have firmly said no to military institutions  in Liberia and GuineaBissau PERIOD  Various African countries have embarked on  policies that will generally raise the standard of life. the union of leaders from across Africa has been key to the continents success thus far he said PERIOD

We plan to turn the continent around by positioning Africa  in the global world he said PERIOD We believe that rather than spending too much time on the Book of Lamentations we would do well to rather move on to the Book of Revelation PERIOD We conceded that it was imperative for Africa to strive in a shared vision to rescue our continent from the edge of oblivion. while its leaders work from the inside Obasanjo said it is equally as important for the global community to see and accept the work that he and other African leaders have set out to do PERIOD

So far we have been heartened by the response of the rest of the world he said PERIOD

Nigeria which gained independence from Great Britain in  but endured years of shortlived democracies political coups detat and military rule instituted its most recent regime with the democratic election of Obasanjo in May of  and then again four years later PERIOD

When we look back at what we have been through as a people we can say in the words of St PERIOD Paul We have proved to be more than conquerors he said PERIOD Despite our pain and suffering the continent has been known as a continent of joy and life. the best way to pull Nigeria firmly into the international spectrum Obasanjo said is to involve it economically in the global market PERIOD He spoke of programs implemented by his government to bring our economy out of the woods and asked that his audience the University and the United States invest in the Nigerian economy and encourage other international interests to do so PERIOD

All of Africa pays attention to his countrys actions and mediating the continents conflicts has become a major part of Nigerias role as the most populous nation in Africa Obasanjo said PERIOD

Firstly try to keep Africa on the discussion table he said PERIOD Do not write us off or put our success stories in the background PERIOD Try to take us seriously PERIOD  Join us in advocating for debt relief in African countries. share This Story
