Womens History Month established just in the past few decades initially began as a week of celebration in  to recognize important and influential American women PERIOD In the following decade moves in Congress eventually established the entire month of March as a time to honor the historic women in American history PERIOD

As Womens History Month steadily gains more awareness with each coming year it is important that we continually use this month to celebrate women of many different demographics rather than focusing solely on uplifting women who are white American cisgender or all three PERIOD Of course it is important to recognize the women who happen to fit these demographics but it is also critical that Womens History Month is inclusive of all women PERIOD

If we are commemorating Womens History Month with an intersectional approach We must honor women such as Kimberl Crenshaw and Angela Davis PERIOD Crenshaw coined the term intersectionality in  to describe the idea that people who belong to multiple disadvantaged demographics experience inequality in a unique and more complex way where the inequality they experience cannot be attributed to just a single factor such as race or gender PERIOD

Women experience disadvantages in our society however a woman who is poor a part of the LGBT community or not white experiences these disadvantages in a way that is unique compared to a cisgender white woman from a high socioeconomic status PERIOD The struggles of poverty racism or discrimination due to being a part of the LGBT community work in conjunction with the patriarchy to create disadvantages that an economically stable white woman would otherwise not face PERIOD

It is important that our feminism recognizes that women of different demographics are affected differently by our society  and that our feminism fights for and celebrates women of all backgrounds PERIOD

While Crenshaw coined the term intersectionality Angela Davis explored similar ideas in her novel Women Race and Class in the early 80s PERIOD If you are new to the world of intersectional feminism Davis novel provides a perspective that will challenge the correlation between your feminism and white supremacy leaving you with a more inclusive way of approaching feminism PERIOD

Womens History Month enables us to not only celebrate women like Crenshaw and Davis who were pivotal figures for advancing womens rights but also an opportunity to pay attention and shed light on issues that are making a massive impact around the world PERIOD

Especially in the United States it is imperative our celebration of women during this month includes uplifting Black transgender women PERIOD Unfortunately our society disproportionately affects and targets this specific demographic. a Black trans womans experience in America is one with many hardships including targeted unemployment violent attacks and hate crimes PERIOD

So how can we help to create a safer environment for Black trans women and other marginalized groups of women The two most important things we can do are to listen to marginalized groups and also use our own privileges to uplift these women PERIOD

Listening to marginalized groups is crucial as we cannot create effective solutions with our own limited view PERIOD As a cisgender or white person it is crucial that your voice does not overshadow the voices of the people who are actually experiencing these struggles because we do not see the entire picture from our outside perspective PERIOD Trying to pave the way to a solution without consulting the actual group that is being affected can actually lead to more harm PERIOD

By listening to marginalized groups experiences we are able to better identify the behavior  subtle and calculated  that causes harm PERIOD This ability to identify harmful behavior allows us to recognize when other people are being harmful but also enhances our ability to recognize our own faults PERIOD Being aware of issues does not mean that we are immune from also negatively contributing to these issues so it is important that we consistently are evaluating our own behavior as well as the behavior of other people PERIOD

Just being aware of the challenges that marginalized women face is not enough PERIOD We must also use our white or cisgender privilege to keep the perpetrators of this behavior in check as well PERIOD Whenever we encounter people acting in a way that harms a certain group of women we need to use our power and actively fight against this behavior PERIOD

Harmful behavior cannot go unnoticed PERIOD

Change will not occur if we just sit at the sidelines and point out an issue PERIOD We must be the active force that challenges these harmful behaviors if we want to see improvements PERIOD

Aside from paying close attention to the issues in our country we need to keep conversations going surrounding issues that women around the world are facing PERIOD Whether it be the femicide epidemic of Mxico the struggle of Polish women to retain their reproductive rights or the everincreasing cases of sexual violence against women in India we must make sure that we are doing all we can to raise awareness PERIOD In this way we can use Womens History Month as a platform to further expand the rights for all women PERIOD

Of course we cannot change the systemic issues that women face with ease PERIOD However listening to the experiences of women of all backgrounds will provide an experience for others to become more aware which in turn allows people to change their behavior as well as stand up against others who are upholding this system of oppression PERIOD
