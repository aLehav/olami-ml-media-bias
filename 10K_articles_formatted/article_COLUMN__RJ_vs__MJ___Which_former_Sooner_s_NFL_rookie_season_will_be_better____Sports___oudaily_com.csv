4978,1970-01-01,"rJ says Sam Bradford

Is there any doubt that Sam Bradford will be the most impactful Sooner taken in this years NFL draft

Wait there is Allow me PERIOD

Of the  players picked in the draft this year Bradford was the first overall selection and  as of this moment  is the highest paid rookie in NFL history PERIOD Hes the  Heisman Trophy winner and unlike Reggie Bushs Heisman Bradfords trophy is going to stay in his living room PERIOD

In the preseason he completed  passes for a  percent completion rate tossed for  yards and has yet to throw an interception in an NFL uniform PERIOD The really complex and sometimes irritating passer rating formula puts him at . pERIOD Not too shabby PERIOD

Although the process was sped up a little when A.J PERIOD Feeley was injured in the preseason Bradford was named the starting quarterback last week as rookie PERIOD It would have happened by Week  anyway PERIOD

To put that fact in perspective the Pittsburgh Steelers had four veteran quarterbacks at training camp and currently on their 53man roster PERIOD They chose Dennis Dixon to start three days after the Rams tapped Bradford and only because their first string quarterback is suspended for the first four games of the season and their second string quarterback tweaked an already dodgy ankle during the preseason PERIOD

St PERIOD Louis head coach Steve Spagnuolo is giving Bradford the keys to the Rams offense PERIOD Hell have a top5 running back to keep defenses honest in play action a dynamic rookie wide receiver in Marty Gilyard as a deep threat and an offensive line that though it can be suspect at times wants to protect him see him succeed PERIOD All of this works in Bradfords favor PERIOD

Barring his shoulder going the way of a fragmentation grenade for a second straight year in the opening game of the season Bradford will have the most successful season of any Sooner in the  NFL Draft class PERIOD

M.J PERIOD says Jermaine Gresham

Its a simple equation When your tight ends couldnt catch a disease in Atlantic City or they block like a kicker especially in a highpowered offense head coaches tend to continually try to find that missing piece in free agency or the draft PERIOD

For the first time since taking over the job Cincinnati Bengals coach Marvin Lewis can say hes found that missing piece former OU standout Jermaine Gresham PERIOD

Gresham was drafted to be the tight end of the future in Cincinnati and Lewis is wasting no time PERIOD As quickly as early August Lewis had already confirmed Gresham as the starting tight end for their opening game against the Patriots Sunday PERIOD

On June  Palmer said Gresham possesses no weaknesses and the sky is the limit for him PERIOD

He will be slotted into an offense full of secondchance talent including narcissistic receivers Chad Ochocinco and Terrell Owens outspoken Cedric Benson and the injurypronebutgreatwhenhealthy quarterback Carson Palmer PERIOD

This offense will absolutely be one of the top scoring units in the league and will target Gresham early and often PERIOD

Not only is Gresham a wide receiver in a tight ends body but he will be a monstrous threat in redzone opportunities where the Bengals needed improvement PERIOD

As for other former Sooners Rams quarterback Sam Bradford will undoubtedly be making a splash but most likely a negative one as he adjusts at the professional level PERIOD

Trent Williams will be a crucial part of the Redskins offense blocking for Clinton Portis but one would be a fool to say Williams will be the most recognized of the bunch PERIOD

Gerald McCoy is a major candidate for defensive rookie of the year but the play of Lions lineman Ndamakong Suh will overshadow McCoy PERIOD

Not only would Jermaine Gresham arguably make the biggest splash in a swimming pool out of the firstyear Sooners in the NFL but he will make the biggest splash on the field too PERIOD
