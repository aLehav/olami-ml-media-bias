8930,2012-02-02,"overcoming the limitations of the traditional classroom environment and enabling students to actively participate with their peers in the emerging global learning community has long been a goal for modern higher education PERIOD Reenvisioning Diasporas a collaborative and interdisciplinary seminarstyle course established this year between Swarthmore College and Asheshi University in Ghana aims to accomplish just this PERIOD

Swarthmore faculty members Sunka Simon associate professor of German and film and media studies and Carina Yervasi associate professor of French developed the course together and coteach the curriculum in conjunction with Professor Mikelle Antoine of Ashesi University located near Accra Ghana PERIOD

The project was funded by grants from the SUNY Center for Online International Collaborative Learning and the TriCollege Digital Humanities Initiative a teaching and research collaboration that seeks to understand the expertise students and faculty need as citizens and professionals in a networked world PERIOD

The course is being offered by the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures with enrollment at seven students from Swarthmore and  from Ghana PERIOD

The centerpiece of the classs meeting this past Tuesday was a group Skype session with their Ashesi counterparts via a large projection screen PERIOD

Individuals in both classes addressed their peers before the camera and seemed very eager to share their observations and opinions with participants on both sides queuing and competing for speaking time PERIOD

While students offered many interesting perspectives the discussion format remained rooted in individual monologue making conversational exchange and response to individual points difficult PERIOD

Issues touched on in the discussion included the authority that ones voice possesses with many students in both classes drawing on their personal experiences as members of linguistic minorities and polyglot communities PERIOD

The primary themes explored by the course include globalization nationality and the nature of ones identity as a member of a diaspora PERIOD Students examine the experiences of communities that have been separated from their homelands as well as the ways in which these groups are represented through historical visual aural and literary sources from Turkey Latin America and West Africa PERIOD

Simon hopes the course will provide students with firsthand experience in international and crosscultural communications through the means of Skype blogging and other interactive forms of cooperative learning with their fellow participating students in Ghana PERIOD We hope the students learn professional lifeskills appreciating the difficulties and rewards inherent in committed crosscultural communication prodding them to take up careers in international cooperations NGOS and others bringing with them a sensitivity and experiencebase outshining some of their less tested competitors Simon said PERIOD At the same time students will have worked with several technological tools including the production and editing of sound files still images and film thus providing them with additional handson experience to list on their resumes. katie Schultz  describes a typical class as including a  to  minute Skype session with students from both schools discussing the assigned readings and media with each other. from time to time class structure develops a collaborative or groupfocused orientation in which a Swarthmore student might discuss class material with several Ghanaian peers via blogging or voicerecording PERIOD This approach has helped me gain a lot of insight into how their points of view differ from mine Schultz said PERIOD

Professor Simon notes that technological difficulties and disparities between the classes are not uncommon regarding this as another vital aspect of the classs overall experience PERIOD Students are already discovering the perpetual nonsimultaneity of new media even as that new media promises to overcome the obstacles of time differences and space Simon said adding that the frequent malfunctioning of electricity or technology has led to the adoption of minding and living with the gap and a NoFrustration policy as course mottoes PERIOD

The unique opportunities for crosscultural interaction and learning through multimedia provided by this class were major selling points for current students enrolled in the course PERIOD

Kara Stoever  a biology and English double major stated that she couldnt turn down the opportunity to join the course PERIOD Though Swarthmore is diverse in many ways to discuss diasporic movements with students in Ghana who identify as part of diasporas has been incredibly meaningful she said PERIOD

Swarthmore graduate Patrick Awuah  established Ashesi in  PERIOD The school was the first liberal arts institution established in the West African state of Ghana PERIOD Ashesi has previously collaborated with Swarthmore the University of California Berkeley and the University of Washington in designing its academic programs PERIOD
