Brad Stone logged on only to see his work had once again been deleted.It wasnt good enough for one of Wikipedias other editors and was flagged as biased undoing his modifications to an entry in the online encyclopedia PERIOD

Stone an EMT from Cambridge Mass. was in an edit war. such edit wars happen every day on Wikipedia the online usergenerated encyclopedia Stone helps to edit along with about  others PERIOD The encyclopedias first . million entries were crafted through more than  million edits according to a HewlettPackard Labs report PERIOD

The online resource has grown to more than  million entries in  languages since its inception in  PERIOD

The digital knowledge base would span  volumes if it were printed in 10inchtallby2inchthick books but whether those volumes of information would be considered acceptable for academic research is a debated topic PERIOD

Many point to the daily edit wars as a safeguard that ensures the sites information is accurate and uptodate PERIOD

Critics however such as the publishers of Encyclopedia Britannica point to the grassroots editing as a sign of instability and say only experts should contribute to true reference materials PERIOD

As a result the Web sites usage in academic research has been limited recently by some university faculty across the country PERIOD Some have opted to ban the site as a citable source others dont even want the tool on the research radar PERIOD

The sites popularity has grown significantly over the years PERIOD Once below the  mark in Internet traffic rankings Wikipedia is now the eighth most visited site on the World Wide Web according to Alexa an Internet traffic ranking service PERIOD

Professors React

Mark Bloom an instructor in the Department of Biology said students likely gravitate to the site because its easy to use PERIOD

Its becoming this cult thing now and people are using it like crazy Bloom said PERIOD They think everything on the Internet is true and they dont go to the original source. many professors arent as fond though PERIOD

Bloom said the site can provide a quick fix of information but doesnt always elaborate on the nuance of an issue or can misrepresent a complicated issue PERIOD

You get two paragraphs of something that gives you the nuts and bolts of something so its easy to get the big points of something that way Bloom said PERIOD

Jeff Coffer chair of the Department of Chemistry agreed PERIOD

The issues are so complex its easy to get a narrower view or just a snapshot of whats going on Coffer said PERIOD So I think one has to be careful PERIOD I think thats the downside to the information age. thats why he said even if Wikipedia was acceptable as a springboard for student research its definitely unacceptable for higherlevel academic research PERIOD

I certainly wouldnt use it for detailed scholarly activities Coffer said PERIOD

The online source can be especially problematic in the sciences said Gary Evans professor of electrical engineering at Southern Methodist University and president of SMUs faculty senate PERIOD

Ive seen textbooks that have major conceptual errors too so its not just Wikipedia Evans said PERIOD Maybe its just the fact that humans are doing it and there are always errors and biases when humans are involved. ralph Carter chair of the Department of Political Science said for some areas of research bias can creep into an entry PERIOD Thats why he said he wont immediately discard research that includes Wikipedia but said it sends up a red flag to see Wikipedia in a bibliography PERIOD

Any online source is less subjected to the peer review process than any print source Carter said PERIOD They shouldnt fail to use Internet sources if theyre an appropriate source but they need to know what those appropriate sources are. don Coerver associate dean of the AddRan College of Humanities and Social Sciences agreed PERIOD

You can put a spin on it and thats worse than being wrong said Coerver who teaches history of Latin America and U.S PERIOD business PERIOD You can point to most of the facts as being correct but that doesnt mean it wouldnt be better to find another source. thats why peerreviewed sources such as academic journals are superior to Wikipedia said Richard Enos a professor in the English Department who used to edit Advances in the History of Rhetoric a research publication from the American Society for the History of Rhetoric PERIOD

The most important feature of journals that are peerreviewed is that they really adjudicate the research process Enos said PERIOD The researcher has to present the research and make a good argument to people who are judges in the field. that process Enos said is absent from the Wikipedia editing process PERIOD

When you get things that arent adjudicated you dont get that opposition for evaluation Enos said PERIOD

He said the discussion that goes on before an article is published in a peerreviewed environment is essential even on subjects that may seem more straightforward PERIOD

Even science is a rhetorical activity in that you have to persuade your audience of the saliency of not just your observations but how you argue them Enos said PERIOD

Reliability

Some studies however have refuted the allegations against the site PERIOD

A  study by Nature a weekly scientific journal found Wikipedias collaborative content to be almost as accurate as that of Encyclopedia Britannica which is also free online PERIOD

For the study the magazine clipped  corresponding entries from each publication and put them up for review by what Nature deemed relevant experts PERIOD

The entries cumulatively had eight egregious errors in the texts  four in Wikipedia four in Britannica PERIOD

Britannica has disputed the study however PERIOD

Almost everything about the journals investigation from the criteria for identifying inaccuracies to the discrepancy between the article text and its headline was wrong and misleading according to a report from Britannica refuting the study PERIOD

Wikipedia stands by its ability however to aggregate factual information into an encyclopediatype text PERIOD

Wikipedia articles are living drafts that are continually being updated and improved upon according to a statement from the Wikimedia Foundation which owns Wikipedia PERIOD

And as traditional encyclopedia authors rely on a handful of writers and researchers Wikipedia continues to open its content for revision  a problem to critics but the organizations selfproclaimed strong suit PERIOD

A  study by the Information Dynamics Laboratory at HewlettPackard Labs found the Wikipedia mentality to be an effective approach at least in the online realm PERIOD

The highquality articles are distinguished by a marked increase in number of edits number of editors and intensity of cooperative behavior as compared to other articles of similar visibility and age according to the labs report Assessing the Value of Cooperation and Quality in Wikipedia PERIOD

Still Not Good Enough

Despite Natures or the Information Dynamics Laboratorys findings even some Wikipedia editors like Stone doubt the sites utility as an academic research tool PERIOD

I think Wikipedia works and its a fantastic idea and its going to improve our ability to get access to modern updated information Stone said PERIOD But the problem is because there are so many people editing it the possibility of running into some small piece of information thats incorrect embedded in the article is very high. stone said the larger concepts within articles are almost always accurate as the Britannica study found because everything on the site must be attributed to credible sources PERIOD

While that gets articles to the point of being factually accurate and rounds out the larger points Stone said it often could omit nuance or result in bias PERIOD

Jeff Bond a science librarian at the Mary Couts Burnett Library said thats why he often uses Wikipedia as a springboard for his research PERIOD

Some of the articles do have a reference list at the end and those references can be a good spring point toward other research Bond said PERIOD

He said the site just cant match other Internet resources most of which are easily accessible to students when it comes to undergraduate research PERIOD

At that level of research every source youd want to use would have to be some type of scholarly peerreviewed type of material Bond said PERIOD",Academics debate reliability of site | TCU 360,Texas Christian University
