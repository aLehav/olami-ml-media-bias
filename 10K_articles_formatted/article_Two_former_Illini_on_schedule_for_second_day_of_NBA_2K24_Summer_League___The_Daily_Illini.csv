2315,2023-11-04,"after a somewhat disappointing first day of the NBA 2K24 Summer League that saw just two of five potential former Illini touch the floor there will hopefully feature a much higher hit rate for day two PERIOD

Malcolm Hill and Alan Griffin are the lone former Illini on the schedule and there is a solid chance their respective teams will have no choice but to let them on the floor PERIOD Hill being an NBAfamiliar guard would offer important relief when  firstround pick Anthony Black requires rest while Griffins squad could use his fresh legs for the second part of a backtoback PERIOD

The longesttenured former Illini at Summer League Hill spent four seasons with the Illini from  before bouncing around international leagues for a couple years PERIOD For stretches of the  and  NBA seasons Hill hopped around the NBA system and spent time with the Atlanta Hawks Chicago Bulls and Windy City Bulls G League affiliate of the Chicago Bulls PERIOD As of now Hill is on the Birmingham Squadrons roster G League affiliate of the New Orleans Pelicans and has yet another chance to showcase his abilities at the NBA level in the Summer League PERIOD

Griffin tied for the secondlongest active Illini at Summer League was mysteriously benched for the entirety of the Milwaukee Bucks game one victory over the Denver Nuggets PERIOD Although head coach Adrian Griffins stance against nepotism is commendable his sons absence may change in game two as many of the Bucks top players expended heavy minutes  hours prior PERIOD

Illinois fans can tune into Hill and the Orlando Magic take on the Detroit Pistons at  p.m PERIOD CT on ESPN before Griffin and the Milwaukee Bucks meet the Phoenix Suns at  p.m PERIOD CT on NBA TV PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD
