The University of Minnesota School of Dentistry administration hosted an online town hall on Oct PERIOD  where they discussed the schools response to COVID19 PERIOD

The town hall came amid ongoing dental students concerns about having required inperson exams limited safe spaces to study and eat as well as an overall lack of student involvement in decisionmaking PERIOD

Students said they had to buy their own personal protective equipment for labs or PPE and had no choice but to cluster together in enclosed spaces in order to watch lab demonstrations closely PERIOD

Though the town hall meeting answered student questions and introduced new initiatives to address COVID19 concerns administrators are working to implement solutions to lower risks for contracting COVID19 PERIOD

We recognize that for our students this academic year is presenting unique and unprecedented challenges said School of Dentistry spokesperson Maureen Lovestrand in an email PERIOD As students have questions or concerns the Schools Office of Student and Resident Affairs is a resource for academic and career counseling academic support or tutoring understanding policies and procedures and helping connect students with student groups as well as mental health resources. ongoing student concerns

The School of Dentistry gave first and secondyear dental students five disposable masks for the fall semester labs to save the PPE for the upper class dental students who take care of patients at the Universitys dental clinic PERIOD

First and secondyear students said faculty members told them to wear the five masks until they were ripped or soiled according to a secondyear dental student who wanted to remain anonymous due to fear of academic retaliation PERIOD A spokesperson for the dental school said students were provided additional masks over the course of the semester PERIOD

While many dental students said it was important to prioritize available PPE to the dental students working with patients and health care workers there was still a need among first and secondyear students PERIOD

I bought facial shields because you could find them anywhere now  all these places are selling them the student said PERIOD But the school keeps claiming they dont have the money to get them for us after they increased our tuition  I dont understand where this money is going. instate tuition at the School of Dentistry increased by  for the  school year PERIOD Since  the instate and outofstate tuition has continued to increase for dental students PERIOD

Keith Mays the School of Dentistrys interim dean sent an email on Oct. to dental students about several reports of students not wearing masks or social distancing in nonclinical areas of Moos Tower like common spaces and hallways PERIOD

The email also addressed reports of some dental students being dismissive to staff and faculty when asked to put on their masks PERIOD

Your actions reflect you your fellow classmates your school and our profession PERIOD This is a time for us to lead by example and demonstrate our commitment to our campus patients and school read the email from the interim dean PERIOD

But some dental students said these incidents were likely a result of having limited safe and socially distanced spaces to eat PERIOD Class scheduling gives students a long break in between labs and many dental students stay on campus to eat study and watch lectures instead of going home PERIOD

First and secondyear dental students are separated into smaller lab groups to avoid large gatherings PERIOD For example on certain days of the week students in groups A and B attend lab from  a.m PERIOD to  a.m PERIOD then take a threehour break before returning to lab from  p.m PERIOD until  p.m PERIOD

Some dental students said their classmates who are commuters or studentparents have trouble staying on campus all day PERIOD During these breaks some dental students said they saw a staff member taking pictures of students without permission when they were eating in the hallways PERIOD

As winter approaches many dental students worry that safe and socially distanced spaces will become even more limited PERIOD

Another secondyear dental student who wanted to remain anonymous due to fear of academic retaliation said he could have been one of the students reported for not wearing a mask PERIOD While sitting in a lecture hall in between lab sections he and three other students ate with their masks down while being socially distanced PERIOD

Even though we followed the official policy by social distancing and avoiding large gatherings sitting in a room that was supposed to be reserved for us and making sure we were sufficiently apart before deciding to take off our mask to eat a single out of context glance may have contributed to the sending of Dr PERIOD Mays email the student said in an email PERIOD

Two secondyear dental students Lauren Moe and Riley Schulz worked together to resolve the class scheduling issues with the School of Dentistrys administration PERIOD Before the fall class schedules were released they raised concerns and provided alternatives PERIOD

I had similar concerns that the schedule was resulting in people having weird chunks of time on campus where they had to be here if they commuted more than  minutes and a lot of interaction between groups when they were intentionally trying to separate us PERIOD So those things were concerning to me so I brought that up to administration Moe said PERIOD

Moe and Schulz shared the two alternative fall schedules to secondyear students so they could vote on what they preferred PERIOD The majority of secondyear students voted to have a different fall schedule PERIOD However the School of Dentistry did not implement these alternative fall schedules PERIOD

We did present these ideas to the administration before our schedule was finalized and in some cases we either heard responses of Oh Im going to direct you to this person instead of me or we just didnt hear responses which was many times the case Schulz said PERIOD

For the upcoming spring semester Moe and Schulz said the School of Dentistry has been more receptive to hearing student feedback about the class scheduling PERIOD

As far as the administration I do think that theyre trying to remedy that now but theyre doing it in time for spring semester when were still kind of left hanging as we go into winter now in this fall semester where were spending it indoors time with classmates Schulz said PERIOD

Responses from School of Dentistry

In  the School of Dentistry experienced a budget crisis including a deficit of . million PERIOD

 was a pretty significant time for us PERIOD We were no longer able to do certain things like overhead and hiring PERIOD  And we at the end of the day did not close any programs and we were able to clean some things up and get back on track Mays said PERIOD

At the town hall meeting Mays introduced a new tuition plan called a pseudo cohort tuition model in an effort to stabilize tuition because of the pandemic PERIOD The model would allow an increase in tuition specifically for first and secondyear dental students and freeze tuition for third and fourthyear dental students PERIOD Currently the model needs to be approved by the University and Board of Regents PERIOD

Along with the new tuition model Mays introduced other COVID19 initiatives at the School of Dentistry PERIOD SvenUlrik Gorr interim associate dean for academic affairs for the dental school is leading a COVID19 Fatigue Workgroup to review recommendations on the wellbeing of the SOD community. additionally a space committee had adapted to identify safe spaces available for students to have lunch and study while socially distanced PERIOD

In the last  minutes of the town hall meeting Mays and Gorr answered questions from the dental students PERIOD One student asked if Mays felt there was a tension between students and the administration PERIOD

I think that theres a lot of tension and concern for people and by people Mays said PERIOD I think when you put all of us together in this kind of tense time its just tense PERIOD But I dont think its about students versus administration. correction A previous version of this article contained several errors PERIOD

The article incorrectly stated the School of Dentistrys past deficit amount and the tuition increase amount for the  school year PERIOD The article also incorrectly stated that the school was projecting a deficit for next year PERIOD The story and the headline incorrectly conveyed reason the dental school hosted the student town hall PERIOD A previous version of this article also mischaracterized the approval process for and intent of the pseudo cohort model PERIOD

The story has been updated with comment from the School of Dentistry on distributing masks to students PERIOD
