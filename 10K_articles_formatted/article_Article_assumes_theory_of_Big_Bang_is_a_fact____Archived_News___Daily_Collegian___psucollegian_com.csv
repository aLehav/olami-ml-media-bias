The article  April  about how a Penn State professor has been trying to figure out how the Big Bang happened with the aid of supercomputers was somewhat humorous PERIOD The article speaks of evolution and the Big Bang theory as fact when it is not PERIOD The mere thought of a  happening and leading to something as complex as the universe and living beings is ridiculous PERIOD These scientists should retake some of their undergraduate science classes to learn that their theories do not obey basic scientific laws PERIOD

Our world is one of conservation not innovation PERIOD Creating or taking account for ones own existence goes against the First Law of Thermodynamics PERIOD Isnt that what they are trying to say happened

Then the Second Law of Thermodynamics PERIOD I thought any system left to itself tends toward disorder not evolving into more complex order PERIOD So if this law is true then the Big Bang along with the rest of evolution is relying on billions of years of violation of the Second Law PERIOD Maybe its just me but I do not see how the  that was made in the  could evolve into a universe with life without breaking this law PERIOD So to you scientists it seems you are breaking two of the most reliable laws of science .. PERIOD Ill save you a seat in class tomorrow PERIOD
