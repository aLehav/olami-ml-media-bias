The MAP testing side is located on the west side of campus at McArthur Court on University Street PERIOD After previously only testing asymptomatic individuals the UO Monitoring and Assessment Program testing site now allows those with mild coldlike symptoms to also get tested for COVID19 PERIOD Mary GrosswendtEmerald

At the University of Oregon the demand for COVID19 tests has grown in recent weeks as over  members of the community have contracted the virus since returning for winter term PERIOD

As the highly transmissible Omicron variant prompts a spike in COVID19 cases across the United States testing centers are overwhelmed with patients and rapid test kits seem to be wiped from the shelves of many drug stores PERIOD

In Oregon alone more than  people are taking tests on average each day PERIOD Roughly  of those tests are coming back positive as of Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

However despite an unparalleled amount of cases and mass shortages of coronavirus tests in other parts of the country UO is making efforts to offer accessible testing amid what is the largest surge to date PERIOD

MAP has expanded testing to meet increased demand from our campus community UO spokesperson Saul Hubbard said PERIOD He said UO made over  testing slots available to Lane County residents during the week PERIOD

UO announced plans to provide COVID19 tests to members of the community and Lane County residents experiencing mild symptoms on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD Originally UOs Monitoring and Testing Program only provided tests to asymptomatic individuals PERIOD

The need for additional testing options in our community at this time is clear MAP Executive Director Brian Fox said in the announcement PERIOD Throughout the pandemic our programs mission has been to expand access to free highly accurate PCR testing to both UO students and employees and other Lane County residents PERIOD This expansion is another step towards that goal. in addition to MAP students can access COVID19 tests through University Health Services if they are experiencing symptoms and would benefit from a medical assessment PERIOD However athome test kits are no longer available PERIOD

Reflecting on the UOs response to an influx of COVID19 cases firstyear student Elliot Nopp said I feel like in terms of offering tests theyre doing pretty good. after break Nopp went to get tested through MAP at McArthur Court PERIOD While he was unable to book an appointment due to slots being full he said that he was able to sign up at the entrance and take a walkin test PERIOD Nopp said he received his results the next morning PERIOD

I feel like its really accessible  certainly more accessible than when I went home for winter break Nopp said PERIOD I had no idea where to go for a test or how long it would take. thirdyear student Sally Thompson however said that she recently attempted to take a test but turned around after encountering a long line PERIOD

It was just kind of a test for peace of mind Thompson said so I felt like I didnt really need it especially after seeing that line. thompson said she feels optimistic about UOs testing processes especially after having smooth experience last term but understands that members of the community are now trying to access tests in larger numbers PERIOD

Nopp said that he thinks its difficult to determine whether students will follow through with a test especially if they are experiencing mild to no symptoms as a result of Omicron PERIOD

I feel like its really hard to say Nopp said PERIOD When I look at the case tracking I kind of expect that its underreported of the actual case count just because there probably are many students who have COVID but dont know they do. for those who are hesitant to get tested for the coronavirus Thompson said that it is important and integral to being a member of the community PERIOD

Youre responsible for yourself she said and so by getting tested and making sure that you arent COVID positive and passing it on to other people youre making sure that youre holding up your end. the Daily Emerald is the news division of Emerald Media Group University of Oregons independent student media organization PERIOD
