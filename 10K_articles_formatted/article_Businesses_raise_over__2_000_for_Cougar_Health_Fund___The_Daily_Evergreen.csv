JAYCE CARRAL Evergreen reporterOctober  

A partnership between ASWSU and several downtown businesses called  Weeks of Pullman resulted in  in donations for the Cougar Health Fund to support mental health and sexual assault prevention PERIOD

From Sept PERIOD  to Sept PERIOD  nine business in Pullman and one in Moscow donated between  and  percent of their revenue to the Cougar Health Fund PERIOD Keegan Otter ASWSU director of Community Affairs was in charge of the event PERIOD

The Coug Health fund is a nonprofit Otter said PERIOD It provides additional mental health resources and sexual assault prevention resources. the businesses involved had the ability to choose how much revenue to contribute Otter said based on how much traction they gained due to the event PERIOD

Students checked out shops and offices and in return the businesses were to invest back into a fund that is for students he said PERIOD

Otter said  Weeks of Pullman encouraged WSU students to involve themselves with the entirety of Pullman not just the WSU campus PERIOD

Students get to explore downtown explore what Pullman has to offer and get their sense of home Otter said PERIOD Theyre going to be here for four maybe five years PERIOD This event brings awareness and exposure. this event replaced a similar one called  Days of Pullman which took place two years before PERIOD Otter said that event did not result in much involvement PERIOD Rather than donations to the school he said contributing businesses gave students small discounts on select items sold PERIOD

The event which garnered support from BL Bicycles was scheduled to intersect with Palouse Bike Week and a WSU home football game in effort to boost sales PERIOD

The hype of having a home football game helped Otter said PERIOD Especially when it came to the dinner and bar scene. one of the largest contributors he said was Paradise Creek Brewery PERIOD The business donated over  to the Cougar Health Fund PERIOD

This event tied the community and the university together Otter said PERIOD The more students that show up to the businesses the more money thats donated to the fund. otter said because most students live on campus it is rare for them to involve themselves in other areas of Pullman PERIOD

WSU is built to have all of its resources on campus he said PERIOD Its really hard to get college students to come downtown and see what it has to offer. otter said he hoped  Weeks of Pullman would expand to a full collaboration between Pullman and Moscow where several businesses from both towns would be involved PERIOD

The event was advertised to WSU students he said PERIOD Two press releases were sent out by Megan Juran WSU senior and director of Community Affairs PR specialist PERIOD

For the next year Otter said he hopes to double the amount of donations made and increase the number of businesses involved PERIOD

Now that we know how much we can raise in the first year we know how much we can build off of for next year Otter said PERIOD It was a successful event in my eyes PERIOD Look for it again this time next year. jayce is a senior multimedia journalism major PERIOD They were research and deputy news editor for fall  copy chief for spring  and news editor from..
