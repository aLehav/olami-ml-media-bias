COURTESY OF IT ENDS WITH US

Characters in this novel show the suffering of being in love with your abuser and the strength of being a survivor PERIOD

SAMANTHA RADCLIFFE Evergreen columnistSeptember  

Like everyone else I am mindlessly scrolling through TikTok any chance I get PERIOD There I happened to stumble across a book recommendation for a novel by Colleen Hoover PERIOD

If you have been on Book TikTok also known as BookTok before you know that every avid reader raves about Hoovers novels such as November  and Ugly Love. after reading the novels blurb I dove into the book expecting a lighthearted story about an adult love triangle PERIOD That was my first mistake PERIOD

The young adult novel It Ends with Us is a riveting drama packed with painful truths about the devastations of domestic violence PERIOD

The novel follows an edgy but cute couple Lily Bloom an owner of a contemporary flower shop and Ryle Kincaid a charming surgeon who never wants to get married or have children PERIOD They meet on a rooftop of an apartment complex after Ryle loses a patient and Lily returns home from her abusive fathers funeral PERIOD

One of the best qualities about Hoovers writing is her ability to weave in foreshadowing throughout the book subtly PERIOD For example despite Ryles sister Rose warning Lily about dating Ryle at the beginning of the novel it takes me completely off guard when Ryle hits Lily for the first time after months of a seemingly healthy relationship PERIOD

Like many other readers I thought Roses warning was just about Ryles inability to commit to relationships but that was my second mistake PERIOD

Fifteen seconds PERIOD Thats all it takes to completely change everything about a person PERIOD Fifteen seconds that well never get back Hoover wrote to illustrate Lilys inner dialogue about that haunting night when Ryle first hit Lily PERIOD

Days after the incident Atlas Corrigan Lilys first love from childhood enters the picture when Lily and Ryle bump into him at his restaurant PERIOD Atlas begs Lily to break up with Ryle but Lily refuses to acknowledge the similarities between hers and her mothers abusive relationships which is exceptionally heartbreaking PERIOD

Regardless of her refusal to acknowledge the obvious Lily is the most admirable heroine out of all the romance books that I have read PERIOD She portrays the independence conviction and strength that I want every woman to aspire to be PERIOD

The most upsetting aspect of this novel is that Hoover based the incidents between Lily and Ryle on her parents abusive relationship PERIOD

In the Note from the Author Hoover explains the first incident of abuse between Lily and Ryle is based on the first time Hoovers father ever hit her mother which makes the whole scene depicted in the novel extraordinarily raw and emotional PERIOD

This novel delivers so much more than just a simple story of a love triangle PERIOD Instead it illustrates a story of a domestic abuse survivor finding the strength to make the right choice in the most complicated situation PERIOD

It stops here PERIOD With me and you PERIOD It ends with us is the most powerful statement found at the end of the novel PERIOD But you have to read it to understand the lines significance and its relation to the strength of domestic abuse survivors PERIOD
