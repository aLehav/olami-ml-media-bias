Whats Mounirmeh about this week

. studying at Langsam

This might trigger some UC students  and all of my friends that hate me for this opinion  but the truth is there really are better places to study on campus PERIOD Finding a study room is essentially impossible and there is always that one student who decides that they need an entire study room for themselves PERIOD

There is also a high probability that youll run in to that friend from your freshman chemistry lab at Langsam PERIOD You havent seen them in forever and you really need to know what theyve been up to PERIOD All of a sudden you only have  minutes to finish your online homework before the deadline PERIOD The amount of people at this library is a distraction itself PERIOD

Langsam has the Triceracopter the massive number of printers the majority of the oncampus books and is definitely conveniently located PERIOD Nevertheless studying at Langsam is meh PERIOD

. birthday cakeflavored anything

From ice cream to granola bars and from coffee to vodka birthday cake flavors are becoming more popular and honestly Im not excited about it PERIOD This flavor infiltrates your taste buds with sweetness and artificial vanilla with each bite or shot of vodka I guess PERIOD

After days of research on the nature of this flavor I learned that the food world has decided that birthday cake is supposed to be a mixture of vanilla and sprinkles PERIOD To me a birthday cake doesnt always have to be vanilla and I personally have never seen sprinkles on a cake PERIOD Why do these food companies get to decide what a birthday cake tastes like

To me a birthday cake is whatever cake you prefer PERIOD For this reason birthday cakeflavored anything makes the list PERIOD

. chili Cookoffs

It seems like everyones job or school club has a chili cookoff and I never really understood it PERIOD Im not from Cincinnati so the great Skyline versus Gold Star debate has been irrelevant to me before coming to UC PERIOD For the most part chili cookoffs have been my only personal encounters with chili PERIOD

These cookoffs tend to be for charity which is always great but I just think that there could be better foods to hold contests for PERIOD Who wants to eat dozens of types of chili in one sitting

. crosley Tower

The grand obelisk of UC that is Crosley Tower definitely makes the list PERIOD The building sticks out like a sore thumb on campus and its not just because of its height PERIOD On the inside it seems empty void and a little bit creepy PERIOD However at a university that is becoming more and more modern Crosley serves as a relic of the past PERIOD

According to UC Magazine Crosley was poured as one single piece of concrete and the fact that it is still standing is really cool PERIOD UC Magazine also debunked the myth that Crosley is leaning or sliding downhill PERIOD Sorry everyone we do not have a leaning tower of UC which is super disappointing PERIOD For these reasons Crosley isnt bad isnt good  just meh PERIOD

 PERIOD Engagement photo shoots

Isnt a marriage proposal supposed to be some kind of surprise When you pay a professional photographer to catch the moment of proposal in a series of photos you effectively ruin the charm and magic of sealing the deal on your relationship PERIOD If I took my significant other to a corn field with a photographer and some random pieces of furniture she would probably freak out and run for her life PERIOD

The photos can look great for sure PERIOD However because I think the photos ruin the charm behind engagement it makes the list PERIOD To each their own though I guess PERIOD
