2857,2003-02-04,"state legislators have announced they will introduce legislation to upgrade 911service to cellular phones PERIOD

The bill will be in compliance with the Federal Communications Commissions  Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act and will make it possible for 911response centers to utilize global positioning technology to track a cell phone users location to within  meters PERIOD

Sen PERIOD Scott Fitzgerald RJuneau Sen PERIOD Joe Liebham RSheboygan Rep PERIOD Scott Jensen RWaukesha and Rep PERIOD Phil Montgomery RAshwaubenon announced last Wednesday they would propose the legislation in a press conference PERIOD In a summary of the bill the legislators cited a case of a Beloit area woman last year who was repeatedly assaulted even after reaching a 911response center on her cell phone because her assailant prevented her from revealing her location PERIOD

Its become a necessity in that our wireless calls now surpass our wireline calls and actually have surpassed wireline calls for about a year and a half Duke Ellingson Operations Manager of Dane County Public Safety Communications told The Badger Herald in December PERIOD

Even if theres an emergency at my apartment my address wouldnt come up said Erin Droese a junior at the University of Wisconsin who uses her cell phone exclusively PERIOD

Fitzgerald said people who move frequently like college students might never establish a permanent wireline because of affordable cellular plans with few charges for services such as long distance PERIOD

People have cell phones with different area codes how do you track that Droese wondered PERIOD I would want my Madison address to show up because its pretty much my permanent residence. ellingson said on a wireline call a callers name phone number and address show up on a  dispatchers screen as soon as the call comes in but precious response time is lost when dispatchers spend minutes determining a callers location PERIOD

The technology is coming along and it basically allows any cell phone to incorporate a GPS Fitzgerald said in December PERIOD Based on the testimony weve had it happens a lot that people really dont know where they are and this technology can locate them to within  meters. the FCCs guidelines were originally meant to be in place by  but after wireless companies complained and asked for more time the commission rolled back the deadline for implementation to Dec PERIOD   PERIOD

The bill being proposed would put the enhancement under the jurisdiction of Wisconsins Public Service Commission PERIOD

Given the states fiscal condition we did not want to create more bureaucracy or unnecessarily increase the cost of this worthwhile program the legislators said in their summary PERIOD

The bill would also place clear limits on the PSC allowing them to gather only the necessary customer information for the program PERIOD
