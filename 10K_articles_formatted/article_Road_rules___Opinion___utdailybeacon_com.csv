Weve got a question for all the drivers on Tennessee roads How many of us

actually pick up a Tennessee drivers handbook and study the rules of the

road anytime after we get that coveted longawaited drivers

license

Not too many apparently PERIOD

In fact wed venture to say very few if any PERIOD

For example When you hear an emergency vehicle police fire truck

ambulance what should you do

Answer You get out of the way immediately as far to the right as

possible and stop until the emergency vehicle has passed PERIOD

But how many people do that

In two separate and probably unrelated incidents last Tuesday Jan PERIOD 

we saw examples of people not following the rules they pledged to follow

when they finally got their licenses PERIOD Both times when a fire truck came

wailing down the road people stopped all right  right in their lanes

which the fire trucks needed in order to get to the fire PERIOD

Way too many people out on the roads arent following state motor

vehicle laws and the consequences can be deadly .. PERIOD and not just for the

drivers involved PERIOD

Some driving laws such as driving on the right side of the road in the

U.S PERIOD anyway are commonsense laws PERIOD If you drive on the left side of the

road on a twolane street youll get hit PERIOD Enough said PERIOD

Other laws are likely going to be ignored as long as we have vehicles PERIOD

Following the speed limit is a great example of this PERIOD Obviously were

always going to have people who are late or just feel like speeding on our

roads and highways PERIOD The police cant catch everyone but they can catch

some and can make it financially disadvantageous to speed PERIOD But we do it

anyway PERIOD

Its absolutely amazing how much we forget when it comes to driving rules PERIOD

For example how many of us remember that wearing a seat belt  for both

passengers and driver  is actually a state law In the Tennessee Code

Annotated books laws  and  say that  This is also common sense because we

stand less chance of losing a battle with the windshield when we have an

accident PERIOD

Turning on headlights  minutes before sunset and during inclement weather

when the windshield wipers are also in use is another littleknown rule PERIOD

Tennessee law T.C.A PERIOD  states that car headlights must be turned

on  And  means lowbeam lights

not highbeam or just parking or fog lights PERIOD Yet drivers are still driving

in the rain with either parking lights only or no lights at all PERIOD Headlights

help other drivers see us when rain fog or night lower visibility PERIOD

Speaking of headlights Tennessee also specifies T.C.A PERIOD  that all

vehicles must have at least two headlights one on either side of the

vehicles front PERIOD Yet how many people still drive with only one headlight

or worse with their lights on high beam so it will light the road like

they have two headlights

And does anyone know that hitchhiking is supposed to be illegal in

Tennessee Yup T.C.A PERIOD  says that no person may stand in a road to

solicit a ride or employment from the driver of a vehicle PERIOD

Yielding road space to an emergency vehicle by getting out of the way

T.C.A PERIOD  is especially important because someones home could be

burning PERIOD A child could be trapped inside that fire or maybe a cherished

pet PERIOD Someones relative might be having a massive heart attack or stroke

and need to get to a hospital PERIOD Or maybe the police have finally tracked

down the person responsible for that neighborhood shooting and are chasing

that persons car PERIOD

Maybe its your home burning or your relative having the medical

emergency PERIOD Wouldnt you want everyone to get out of the way so the

emergency vehicles can get through and save your house or loved one

Of course you would PERIOD So would the drivers around you PERIOD

And to the outofstaters just coming to the university for four years or

five  not only is brushing up on your new states driver handbook a good

idea it could just save your life PERIOD You dont have to take the written test

if your other license is still valid but perusing a copy of the state

driving handbook is still smart PERIOD

True were all breaking driving laws everyday some intentionally some

unknowingly PERIOD But if theres one rule of the road you should remember

it should be to get out of the way of emergency vehicles PERIOD You or someone

you know might be thankful you did PERIOD
