2209,2022-03-16,"students will soon receive their federally subsidized loans directly from the government rather than through banks and credit unions according to a University press release Monday PERIOD

The University will move to the Federal Direct Student Loan Program FDSLP for loans this summer as many private lenders pull out of the Federal Family Education

Loan Program FFELP that the University has used in the past PERIOD Interest rates for students receiving federally subsidized Stafford loans will not change and interest rates for PLUS loans will go down according to the press release PERIOD

This will mean a guaranteed stable source of loan funds for the foreseeable future said Scott Sudduth a congressional lobbyist for the University PERIOD One of the problems with the recession is that private lenders are getting out of the business of providing student loans. sudduth said that under FDSLP some of the roles that private lenders now play in advising students would fall to University financial aid offices PERIOD There are extensive personnel and expertise devoted to financial aid to begin with Sudduth said PERIOD I dont think this will be a tremendously different burden on administrators. banks credit unions and other private lenders have backed out of the FFELP in recent years due to the credit crisis including Bank of America and U.S PERIOD Bank in December PERIOD Students receiving loans from these banks have had to scramble to find a new source of funding PERIOD

The University currently participates in FFELP the largest university loan program in the country in which the federal government partially subsidizes private lenders to issue loans to students and guarantees repayment to lenders if students default on the loans PERIOD Sudduth said University students currently receive  million annually in federal financial aid most of which comes in the form of subsidized loans through private lenders PERIOD

The FDSLP issues Stafford and PLUS loans directly to students without a federally subsidized private intermediary PERIOD Students cannot participate in FDSLP if they attend a University that uses FFELP PERIOD

Once the University makes the transition students already receiving FFELP loans will have to sign new master promissory notes through their Office of College Aid but the change will not affect the terms of their loans PERIOD

Congress is considering legislation that would end federal subsidies to private lenders this summer effectively making direct federal loans the only option for students and universities PERIOD In April President Obama proposed allowing FFELP to expire and using the subsidy money to fund more Pell grants and expand the FDSLP PERIOD FDSLP supporters argue that using thirdparty private lenders leads to higher administrative costs and greater risk to students PERIOD

Congress was sending strong signals to the higher education community that they werent going to renew that guarantee Sudduth said referring to the financial backing of private lenders under the FFELP PERIOD The federal government has been encouraging institutions to prepare to move to direct lending. critics of the change have argued that the costs associated with private lenders include individual financial counseling to students and that without such support students might be more likely to default on loans PERIOD

But Sudduth pointed out that administrators in the Office of Financial Aid will provide support to students PERIOD The level of counseling and assistance that they receive will not change he said PERIOD
