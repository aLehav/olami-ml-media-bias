The Emory softball team won two of three games against DePauw University Ind. to claim their first series win of the season on March  PERIOD

DePauw came out of the gate swinging scoring seven runs in the first inning PERIOD Emory responded in the bottom half of the inning with a twoRBI single from sophomore third baseman Natalie Arreguin to cut the lead to  PERIOD

After a disappointing first inning senior pitcher Madeline Maday pitched six straight shutout innings to limit the Tigers to a final tally of seven runs PERIOD However the first inning provided all the offense DePauw needed as Emorys three runs in the last three innings were insufficient PERIOD Depauw prevailed  PERIOD

The Eagles bounced back in the second game of the series with an impressive offensive display that produced a seasonhigh of nine runs PERIOD

Senior shortstop Cassie Baca had a huge game at the plate producing three RBIs on three extrabase hits PERIOD Sophomore designated hitter Meghan Murphy added an RBI and a pair of runs PERIOD Senior center fielder Jenna Wilson also stole multiple bases and scored all three times she was on base PERIOD

Senior pitcher Toko Miller remained stalwart through six innings limiting DePauw to four runs PERIOD Junior pitcher Sami Feller shut down any possibility of a Tigers comeback in the seventh inning allowing Emory to pick up their first win of the season  PERIOD

Baca was proud of the Eagles response in the second game of the series after starting the season with an  record PERIOD

We had two options Baca said PERIOD We could have let the slow start continue or we could bounce back PERIOD The second game proved the team has some fight. the series rubber match fittingly proved the closest of the three games PERIOD

A comparatively lowscoring game saw DePauw take a narrow  lead entering the bottom of the fifth inning PERIOD Sophomore pitcher Madison Schaefer had a strong outing allowing only four hits and one earned run but DePauw contained Emorys offense similarly up until this point PERIOD

In the bottom of the fifth Emory took a commanding  lead thanks to a fourrun inning led by a twoRBI double from junior second baseman Sarah Katz PERIOD In the top of the sixth DePauw answered with two runs to make it a onerun game PERIOD An Emory insurance run in the bottom half of the sixth sent Miller to the mound in the seventh with a  lead PERIOD

Miller blanked the Tigers in the last inning earning a save and securing the series win for the Eagles PERIOD

Although the last two victories proved exciting for the team Head Coach Adrianna Baggetta remains more concerned with the teams growth than with their results at this stage in the season PERIOD

Our focus is to continue to grow Baggetta said PERIOD Softball is a repetition sport and we want to get into a good rhythm. emory goes on the road next week to face Maryville College Tenn. for a March  doubleheader before hosting the Emory Invitational from March  to  PERIOD
