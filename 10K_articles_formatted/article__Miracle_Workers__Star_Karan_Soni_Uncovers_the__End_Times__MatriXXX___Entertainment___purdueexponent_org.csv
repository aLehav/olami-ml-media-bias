This interview was conducted prior to the SAGAFTRA strike authorization. warning The below contains MAJOR spoilers for Miracle Workers Season  Episode  The MatriXXX. miracle Workers continues its dystopian comedy tour in the latest episode The MatriXXX in which married couple Sid Daniel Radcliffe and Freya Geraldine Viswanathan try to bring a little spice back into their relationship with the help of killbot TI90 Karan Soni a.k.a PERIOD Tai PERIOD

Together they agree to enter the MatriXXX a big void filled with various sex toys where they are asked to unlock an array of fantasies from their minds in order to reignite the missing spark PERIOD At the helm of it all is Tai who dons Laurence Fishburnes actual Matrix jacket according to Soni PERIOD

Credit TBS

The actor excitedly reveals that most of the wild toys seen in this void were actually real PERIOD It was just so crazy PERIOD And there were things I have never seen that were on there PERIOD The props people just went to Hollywood Boulevard to one of those sex shops and just bought all the stuff and built that wall Soni explains PERIOD

As for the jacket its Fishburne origins make a bit of sense as Soni points out Thats why its a little bit too big on me PERIOD It was from the second Matrix movie PERIOD The lining had his name on it cause its from the Warner Brothers costume house so that was really cool. decked out in the gear Tai tries to get Sid and Freya to break out of their shells PERIOD

Hes rather disappointed when they bond best over an imagined date out with live music and appetizers rather than one of their more twisted fantasies which range from electrocution to a strange attraction to boulders PERIOD While the experiment works for the couple Tai continues to see how wellsuited to suburbia Sid and Freya are PERIOD

Will that cause concern Only time will tell PERIOD For now Soni is reveling in his Matrix moment PERIOD I love The Matrix PERIOD And there was a weird thing where I put on the jacket and it just kind of felt like a second skin PERIOD It was very fun. see Soni and his costars have even more postapocalyptic fun as Miracle Workers continues on TBS PERIOD

Miracle Workers Season  Mondays 109c TBS
