His desk is covered with stacks of paper PERIOD A master plan of Moorpark College covers his office wall displaying buildings he had a part in erecting PERIOD For Vice President of Business Services Ray Di Guilio the buildings are like badges of honor PERIOD In his threedecadecareer with Ventura Countys community colleges Di Guilio has had many responsibilities and has worn many proverbial hats PERIOD He has both hired and fired people PERIOD He closed a cafeteria and has overseen the opening of several academic buildings PERIOD In the middle of his career he ran for and was elected the Mayor of the City of Ventura PERIOD

After an illustrious 30year career with the Ventura County Community College District Di Guilio is retiring PERIOD He first was employed at Ventura College in the 1970s and worked there for  years PERIOD Then he was transferred to Moorpark College with the help of thenPresident James Walker PERIOD At Moorpark Di Guilio became the V.P PERIOD of Business Services a position that Di Guilio said was under a couple of different names over the years PERIOD In the meantime he also worked at the district office in Ventura PERIOD

A few years later in  he was transferred again to Oxnard College in the same position PERIOD However he soon decided to take a step into politics and was elected to Venturas City Council in  PERIOD He soon was elected again as mayor of his hometown and found that being both an elected official and V.P PERIOD at OC was too much.The work load became overwhelming said Di Guilio PERIOD

Di Guilio decided in  to temporarily retire from the district or in his words was on a leave of absence to allow more time to serve as Venturas Mayor.A sense of deja vu came to Di Guilio when he decided to not seek a third term for Mayor and instead came back to Moorpark College as the V.P PERIOD of Business Services in .Di Guilio considered his greatest accomplishment to be among other things to engage in stabilizing the colleges finances and to be involved with college construction projects.I am pleased to be involved with the college facilities. di Guilio considers the toughest aspects of his job to be dealing with budget cuts and having to give employees a pink slip PERIOD He cited the temporary closure and laying off of employees at the MC Cafeteria in  to be one of the hardest decisions he had to make PERIOD However he said that later he was able to rehire some of the laid off employees for the bookstore PERIOD
