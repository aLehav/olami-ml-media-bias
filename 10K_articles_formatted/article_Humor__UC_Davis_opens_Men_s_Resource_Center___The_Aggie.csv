Just when you thought the Silo was the best renovation



Among the many things UC Davis is currently renovating the university decided last week to follow its series of innovative and necessary changes by opening a Mens Resource Center PERIOD Though many female faculty seemed opposed to the idea its clear that they really dont know whats best for them and should know that things like this just kind of happen PERIOD

It was later mansplained to these women that the UC Davis Womens Resources and Research Center will be torn down in order to make room for the incoming Mens Resource Center PERIOD

We dont really understand how irony works said Eli The Misogynist the leader of the construction project and an allaround awful person PERIOD So Im okay with this. female students seemed concerned about the renovation too but The Misogynist was sure to address their worries by detailing what the project is really about PERIOD

Men are a minority which is targeted every day PERIOD We need resources available to us on campus to remind women that not everything is about them PERIOD It is really selfcentered to have a center dedicated to your gender. other male students agree with Misogynist and added their unsolicited opinions to the conversation PERIOD

Men go through a lot of struggles PERIOD For example a woman will never understand the pain of being separated from the boyz or being called sexist for catcalling women PERIOD These things hurt and we need coping mechanisms claimed an anonymous student who doesnt think women are people PERIOD

There really is no arguing with that logic PERIOD If women are actually equal to men then why do they keep demanding equality Also why did they fight so hard in the early 1900s to keep suffering It just doesnt add up PERIOD Maybe because women cant do math or because they dont have boyfriends or husbands to teach them PERIOD Luckily with the added resources for men women might finally have a chance to learn PERIOD
