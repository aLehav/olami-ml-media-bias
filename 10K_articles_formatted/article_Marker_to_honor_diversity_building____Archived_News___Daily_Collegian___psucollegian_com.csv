The Paul Robeson Cultural Center hosted a dedication ceremony and reception Friday to reveal a newly placed historical marker at the former site of the Walnut Building in honor of its role as the center of minority student social cultural and political life at Penn State from  to  PERIOD

In the summer of  the Walnut Building was demolished to make room for the current Chemistry Building said Darryl Daisey Class of  and the creator of the Penn State African American Chronicles . in  Daisey said a former army surplus building was transferred from a base in Lebanon Pa. to the Shortlidge Road site PERIOD It later served as the Temporary Union Building or the TUB for students in the 1940s and 1950s while the Hetzel Union Building or HUB was under initial construction PERIOD

After the HUB opened in  the TUB was renamed the Walnut Building PERIOD The Division of Student Affairs and later the Department of Anthropology used it before it became home to the studentrun Black Cultural Center and in the early 1970s the Paul Robeson Cultural Center he said PERIOD

The Walnut Building was the center of Black and Hispanic cultural and social diversity while I was at Penn State he said PERIOD It may of not have been the biggest or most glamorous building on campus but it was ours  it was our home. the Penn State Black History Project  which aims to chronicle and recognize black students staff faculty organizations and alumni at Penn State  submitted a proposal for the historical marker in the summer of  Daisey said PERIOD

Until Friday there was only one campus marker to chronicle an important event in Penn States Black History  a visit by Martin Luther King Jr. which is why the marker for the Walnut Building is so important Daisey said PERIOD

The African American community has been at Penn State for over  years he said PERIOD We contributed a lot to this University and we should be recognized. several speakers also participated in the ceremony including former Black Caucus President Marvin Johnson Class of  PERIOD Johnson said black students only comprised a small percentage of the student population during his time on campus so the Walnut Building was considered to be a social haven for many minority students PERIOD
