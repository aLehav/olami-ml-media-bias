OU coach Lincoln Riley after winning the Big  Championship game against Baylor Dec PERIOD   PERIOD

East Carolina offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Donnie Kirkpatrick still remembers having to leave the room PERIOD

Before national signing day in  the theninside receivers coach and recruiting coordinator at ECU made a livingroom visit to a threestar running back recruit in Charlotte North Carolina along with thenoffensive coordinator Lincoln Riley PERIOD Kirkpatrick has had a lot of recruiting success at ECU but in a July interview with The Daily he insists with a laugh I remember the ones that we didnt win more than the ones we did win. that is why seven years later Kirkpatrick still remembers the recruit whom he wouldnt name and his mother who Kirkpatrick recalls wanted nothing to do with her son playing for the Pirates PERIOD

She thought he should go to the SEC or at least the ACC and she just about disrupted the entire visit Kirkpatrick said PERIOD She just wouldnt listen to it PERIOD It got frustrating. eventually as it seemed the visit wasnt going anywhere Kirkpatrick and thenrunning backs coach Kirk Doll left the room PERIOD But Riley stayed behind and listened to everything the mother had to say PERIOD

She had her concerns and rightfully so PERIOD With an air raid offense the concern of her son getting enough meaningful touches of the football loomed with how Rileys success at Texas Tech with throwing the ball turned out PERIOD Another concern was academics PERIOD The recruit wanted a degree in architectural design and thought there were better options out there for him PERIOD

Riley came prepared PERIOD He presented her with statistics from past running backs at Texas Tech  where Riley was an offensive assistant for seven years  who not only found success in rushing yards but receiving yards too saying running backs have more NFL Draft success with developed receiving skills PERIOD

As for the concern of academics Riley gave her a list of contacts for professors at ECU mentors in the major and graduates with an architectural degree PERIOD Riley did everything to not deliver empty promises and wanted her to know he had a plan for her son PERIOD

When you talk about things youre not just flying on the seat of your pants and recruiting somebody because somebody else is recruiting them Doll said PERIOD Youre recruiting him because you know truly he can help your program and he can benefit from being in your program. kirkpatrick has a lot of fond memories while coaching alongside Riley PERIOD They had a lot of success with Rileys version of the air raid offense and had their fair share of recruiting success as well having garnered signatures from the likes of nowAtlanta Falcons wide receiver Justin Hardy and nowOakland Raiders wide receiver Zay Jones PERIOD Both are in the top  of the NCAAs alltime receiving yards list PERIOD

On Wednesday Dec PERIOD  now seven years later Riley is bringing in a  class ranked No PERIOD  on Rivals.com which includes  fourstar recruits PERIOD In his three seasons at the helm of the Sooners Riley has landed recruiting classes that have ranked No PERIOD   and No PERIOD   PERIOD

But the story of Riley giving everything he had to try and get the threestar running back in  still stays with Kirkpatrick years later PERIOD Rileys efforts may not have worked on the mother but it certainly made an impact on the recruit PERIOD

The kid came and walked us to the car and the kid broke into tears Kirkpatrick said and said I really want to come play for you guys at East Carolina but my moms not gonna let me do it PERIOD I gotta listen to my mom. we didnt get the kid PERIOD He went to a different school. rileys recruiting approach that day is the same manner he currently uses at Oklahoma and it led to him assisting Reggie Grimes and his plan for his son Reggie Grimes II PERIOD

Before Reggie  a fourstar defensive end from Antioch Tennessee ranked the No PERIOD  recruit on Rivals.com and No PERIOD  at his position  made a commitment Reggies dad wanted to make sure the school he chose saw him as more than a football player PERIOD

Reggie wants to get a degree in mechanical engineering and Reggies dad made sure to let the programs pursuing his son knew that PERIOD Which is why a few weeks after Reggie made his official visit to Norman for OUs match against West Virginia on Oct PERIOD  Grimes emailed Riley and asked the thirdyear head coach for a plan outlining Reggies academic career to ensure he gets a degree from Oklahoma PERIOD

The next day Reggies dad received an email from an OU professor with details on the mechanical engineering track along with contacts to talk to those involved in the field PERIOD

Riley said it was certainly a track that it could be done in conjunction with football that he doesnt have to choose engineering over football in this case Reggies dad said PERIOD It means everything PERIOD That goes a long way in us feeling comfortable with him attending school some  miles away PERIOD Obviously he just cant come and go home as regularly PERIOD We wont be able to put our hands on him or lay eyes on him as regularly as we have all his life PERIOD

So for Riley to be able to get back to us and show us that he supports that it goes a long way in us feeling comfortable about the decision. reggie made his verbal commitment to the Sooners shortly after on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD Hes the nineteenth verbal commit for the OUs class of  and is one of  four stars in the class PERIOD The defensive end garnered  other offers besides Oklahoma  a list of schools that includes Alabama Clemson Ohio State and local Tennessee PERIOD His first time meeting Riley was on his official visit and the family stayed in close contact with the program since PERIOD

This season with the Sooners last regular season game running a week later than past seasons Riley has been crunching two weeks of home visits into one PERIOD On Wednesday Dec PERIOD  just a few days after the Sooners won their fifthstraight Big  Championship and clinched their fourth College Football Playoff berth in five years seeing Reggie was just one of many destinations for Riley and his staff PERIOD

Riley and defensive line coach Calvin Thibodeaux ate dinner at Reggies uncles house alongside his closest family and friends PERIOD

Probably the biggest thing that stood out was the culture kind of the laid back atmosphere PERIOD While everything was obviously serious business it was probably a little bit more of a family feel Reggies dad said PERIOD Obviously it does hold weight that he took time out of his busy schedule and preparing for a championship he was in a bit of a pretty busy stretch PERIOD

Its really just more of just getting to the family him getting to know the family us getting to know him better because were going to be tied to this thing for the next four five years. when Riley entered the house his tactics were the same as they were back when he coached at ECU PERIOD Along with getting to know the family he and Thibodeaux wanted to know what Reggies needs were PERIOD

I think they wanted to learn more about us Reggies dad said PERIOD We wanted to learn more about them PERIOD It was just kind of informal PERIOD It wasnt anything formal set up PERIOD We ate a little dinner and we were able to talk. when Riley enters a household hes bringing with him an aura of five conference championships a  coaching record and two Heisman Trophy winners produced under his guidance PERIOD In less than two weeks hell be competing in the College Football Playoff in the Peach Bowl but to those who have coached with him and have been recruited by him hes there for one reason to connect with the family of recruit he thinks can help the program PERIOD

Its led to Riley being considered one of most dominant recruiters in the nation PERIOD

When he enters a room its not like hes better than them said Doll who is now a senior defensive analyst at East Carolina PERIOD Hes at their level and hes very easy to communicate with and he does a great job in terms of knowing the importance of each persons needs whether it be academics or how to develop them into a better person or a better player or what not. with rumors continuing to grow about Riley potentially jumping to the NFL the common consensus is whats holding him back is his love for recruiting and developing young athletes PERIOD From his multiple home visits with Riley Doll wouldnt be surprised if Riley stays at the college level a while longer even though the NFL rumors are there PERIOD

Right now he loves what hes doing Doll said PERIOD Theyve had so much success at Oklahoma in recruiting  which you should at Oklahoma PERIOD He pretty much has elevated it to another level pretty much. and from the looks of whats to come Wednesday Riley has shown no signs of slowing down PERIOD
