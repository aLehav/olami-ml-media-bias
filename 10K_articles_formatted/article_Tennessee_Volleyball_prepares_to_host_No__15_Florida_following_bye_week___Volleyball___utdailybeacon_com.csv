Tennessee looks to move to   on the year as they host No PERIOD  Florida on Wednesday in ThompsonBoling Arena PERIOD

Both Florida and Tennessee are coming off bye weeks ahead of their matchup PERIOD Head Coach Eve Rackham Watt is happy with the teams progress over the time off PERIOD

We had a very specific plan for that week and a half of what we wanted to get better at and improve at PERIOD That was really our blocking and floor defense Rackham Watt said PERIOD We spent an enormous amount of practice time on it everyday and its gotten a little better everyday PERIOD The biggest thing is doing it against somebody whos not us and so I think thats what were looking forward to seeing is what shows up on Wednesday. florida comes into the match ranked No PERIOD  and boasting a   record PERIOD Florida is coming off a tough fiveset loss to South Carolina which ended their seven game win streak PERIOD Rackham Watt says the Gators will be a tough test for Tennessee PERIOD

Theyre experienced they have a great outside hitter  the transfer that came in from Syracuse Rackham Watt said PERIOD Theyre big in the middle they have an experienced Libero PERIOD Their freshman setter is doing a great job PERIOD Theyre really good at every position and theyre pretty experienced at every position PERIOD So theyre a tough battle. as a team Florida is hitting . and has  kills PERIOD Syracuse transfer Marina Markova has  kills for Florida which is second on the team PERIOD The 6foot5 outside hitter is hitting . on the year PERIOD Sophomore Merritt Beason leads the Gators with  kills on the year PERIOD She is swinging . for Florida PERIOD

Rackham Watt believes as long as Tennessee controls the match and keeps Floridas middle blockers at bay the Lady Vols will find success PERIOD

The biggest thing for us will be the servepass Rackham Watt said PERIOD I know thats pretty much always the answer but were going to have to win the serving and passing battle. offensively Tennessee is led by senior Morgahn Fingall and sophomore Erykah Lovett PERIOD Fingall is swinging . for the Lady Vols with  kills PERIOD Lovett has  kills hitting . pERIOD

On top of continuing their offensive dominance Rackham Watt is looking for Tennessees defense to step up against Florida PERIOD

I think for us weve been working on our block defense Rackham Watt said PERIOD Were hoping that shows up Wednesday PERIOD Weve got two young middle blockers so trying to get them up to speed as much as we possibly can and kind of tie that into our floor defense as well. sophomore Ashllyn King has replaced Paola Laborda as libero recently for the Lady Vols PERIOD King averages . digs per set and has  digs on the year PERIOD Oregon transfer Kylie Robinson is averaging . digs per set and has  on the year PERIOD She also has  assists and averages . assists per set putting her at third on the team PERIOD
