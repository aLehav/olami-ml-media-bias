3251,2021-08-05,"marquette simply doesnt lose at home PERIOD Dating back to  when the Golden Eagles won their first American Division title they are  at Valley Fields PERIOD

Of course Marquette is  overall during that time but holding a strong home field advantage is one way to guarantee postseason success PERIOD

Should the Golden Eagles win their next five games it would guarantee a bye in the first round of the Big East Tournament and host a second round matchup PERIOD

A win there would put them at  overall and would virtually ensure hosting an NCAA Tournament game for the third straight year PERIOD

Its challenging and mentally demanding being on the road but theres nothing like playing at home in front of fans and family junior defender Emily Jacobson said PERIOD

Marquette knocked off Louisville and Cincinnati this past weekend by a combined score of70 and has not been scored upon in its last five matches PERIOD

During their sixgame winning streak the Golden Eagles are outscoring opponents  PERIOD

Were becoming a real tight unit and were a little more consistent overall lately coach Markus Roeders said PERIOD We dont give up a whole lot of goals so those are all positives. marquette has demolished Big East opponents over the last three years going  against the competition with a lone loss coming at West Virginia last year PERIOD

In Big East regular season play the Golden Eagles havent lost at home since Oct PERIOD   dropping a  decision to Rutgers PERIOD

As expected the Louisville match was the more difficult game last weekend as the Golden Eagles took  minutes to break into the scoring column before adding an insurance goal on a long free kick from Jacobson with just eight minutes to play PERIOD

That goal was huge Jacobson said of her goal PERIOD Its important to get a second goal because it takes a ton of pressure off of us on defense and can open up the game a little more. the Bearcats didnt give Marquette much of a challenge with the first goal in the tenth minute from junior forward Maegan Kelly PERIOD

Sheadded two more goals later in the game to increase her total to five for the year PERIOD It was a relief for Kelly who scored  goals last year and seven as a freshman PERIOD

I always come into a game with the goal of scoring and today that definitely happened Kelly said PERIOD

The junior has contributed in other areas this year leading the team with six assists PERIOD

Junior midfielder Kate Reigle has had a breakout season so far this year off the bench scoring five times and tallying five assists PERIOD Reigle matched her goal total from her previous two seasons on Sunday to pad Marquettes lead to  in the first half PERIOD

My goal coming into the year was to beat my goal total from last year which Ive done already Reigle said PERIOD Its good to fly under the radar a little bit coming off the bench because it gives us another weapon on offense. while the Golden Eagles have had undeniable success in Milwaukee this weekend will be different as Marquette travels to Providence and Connecticut PERIOD

The Friars and Huskies are a combined  in Big East play and are  at home PERIOD Both teams are also in Marquettes division and could make a run at the top of the standings by upsetting the Golden Eagles this weekend PERIOD

The Friars boast a win over Syracuse which is five points behind Marquette in second place in the American Division PERIOD In games against Georgetown and Notre Dame however the Friars are  PERIOD

The Hoyas and Irish are tied for first place in the National Division and vying for a No PERIOD  seed in the Big East Tournament PERIOD

Connecticut meanwhile has played a difficult schedule playing North Carolina and hosting UCLA in a match that was eventually canceled due to rain PERIOD

As long as we keep winning well be fine the venue doesnt really matter Kelly said PERIOD
