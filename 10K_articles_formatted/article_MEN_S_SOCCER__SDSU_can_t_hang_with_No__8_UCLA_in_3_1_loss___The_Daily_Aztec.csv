On Saturday afternoon the SDSU Sports Deck was packed with lively UCLA and San Diego State fans as the eighthranked Bruins defeated SDSU  on Senior Day PERIOD While the Aztecs   Pac10 concluded their season with a loss five seniors were celebrated for their efforts PERIOD

Goalkeeper Brad Byrns midfielder Khadim Diouf defender Falke Verwer and forwards Raymundo Reza and Michael Rocha all played their last regular season game for SDSU PERIOD

We will definitely miss the seniors assistant coach Matt Hall said PERIOD We are proud of the game they played today. in the first half the Bruins   Pac10  took control of the match as Andy Rose scored the first goal just six  minutes into the game off of a penalty kick PERIOD The ball just barely flew  past Byrns fingertips and sank into the net PERIOD

Bruin goalie Brian Rowe had two saves leading up to halftime while Byrns had none PERIOD

Their  keeper made great saves Hall said PERIOD We could have improved there PERIOD We  have to get sharper in the defensive third and attacking third that is  where games are won or lost. in the second half the Aztecs came  out energized and increased their shot attempts from five during the  first half to  PERIOD Still UCLA fought back and sophomore forward Chandler  Hoffman scored the second goal of the game during the sixty-first minute off of an assist by Eder Arreola and Victor Chavez PERIOD

Finally in the seventy-second minute freshman forward Miles Byass scored the lone goal for SDSU after taking a pass from midfielder Casey Meuser PERIOD

I thought the second half goal would get us back in the game but it didnt Byass said PERIOD Its a bittersweet feeling to lose like this especially on Senior Day. as  the remaining minutes of the game clock ran down the Aztecs poured on  the pressure taking more shots and making an effort at better defense PERIOD  However it was not enough as UCLA forward Reed Williams scored the  third and final goal of the game during the seventy-ninth minute PERIOD SDSU clearly outshot the Bruins  to  but only Byass shot was successful PERIOD

I think that todays game sums up our season PERIOD We didnt get the win but we outplayed the team Byass said PERIOD We outplayed UCLA today and we deserved to win but didnt get it.",MEN’S SOCCER: SDSU can’t hang with No. 8 UCLA in 3-1 loss – The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
