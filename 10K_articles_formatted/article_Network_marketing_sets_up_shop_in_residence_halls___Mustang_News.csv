Network marketing might sound like 1950s Tupperware parties that gave housewives an opportunity to make some money after World War II PERIOD During these parties the hostess or consultant would invite friends and family over to sell Tupperware quite different from the traditional sales environment PERIOD

Though these parties began more than  years ago social media allowed them to make their way from suburban homes to residence halls PERIOD

Network marketing  also known as multilevel marketing directsales marketing or referral marketing is a business model where revenue is gained by not only the amount of products the salesperson sells but also how many people they recruit to their network PERIOD Many companies like Mary Kay Arbonne Aloette doTerra and Amway use network marketing to promote their brand PERIOD

Industrial technology and packaging freshman Noelle Laird is a consultant for Arbonne and has worked for the company for a month PERIOD Arbonne gives their consultants cash bonuses  to  percent of retail profit and a life insurance program among other benefits PERIOD Arbonne has a sevenlevel chain of command from consultants at the very bottom to national vice presidents at the top PERIOD Consultants make an average monthly income between  and  while national vice presidents can make over  PERIOD

Once employees move up from consultants they make commission off the products they sell as well as the products the employees under them sell PERIOD For Laird to move up to district manager she is growing her network by inviting her friends to host residence hall parties with Arbonne products PERIOD

Arbonne is a business you build for yourself Laird said PERIOD It helps me with time management PERIOD I was spreading myself across three or four different jobs  I work at Blast downtown I babysit I tutor PERIOD Its my own business but Im working with a bunch of different people PERIOD Holding those parties  Im really just trying to share about the business PERIOD If they sign up then I can build my business off of them too. according to Laird during these parties hosts  usually a friend of the consultant  invites friends living in the residence hall to try the companys products PERIOD The host provides snacks and guests play games to win prizes PERIOD Prizes include samples of Arbonnes dietary supplements and fizz sticks their most popular products PERIOD Attendees are also encouraged to try Arbonnes makeup products PERIOD During this time the consultant and district manager will talk to the guests about their experience with the company to encourage recruiting PERIOD

Were not putting money into famous people were putting money back into our business Laird said PERIOD The product goes straight from the manufacturer to the customer so theres all this extra money that they give back to the consultants PERIOD No extra money for the inbetweens. similar to Arbonne Aloette is a skincare company that uses network marketing PERIOD Kristen Jones is the owner of an Aloette franchise president of Aloette of Central Coast California and worked in network marketing for  years PERIOD Recently Jones was invited to speak at a Cal Poly Women in Business Association meeting about her experience as a small business owner PERIOD Jones gave away more than  of free product vouchers to winners of a raffle and invited the winners to her house to try Aloettes products PERIOD For each friend a raffle winner brought  they got  worth of free product PERIOD According to Jones this kind of network marketing is becoming popular because of social media PERIOD

I think that network marketing is becoming more popular because its a way for people to make supplemental or fulltime income with flexibility she said PERIOD Many people these days have a lot going on and with social media and the way were able to network with people literally all over the world more people are drawn to the supplemental income the flexibility the lifestyle. thats what network marketing for many companies like Aloette and Arbonne is a lifestyle PERIOD For people like Jones and Laird its sharing products of a company they believe in and are passionate about PERIOD

Really its not about me trying to sell the product its me sharing the lifestyle that Arbonne has Laird said PERIOD Im not preaching something I dont believe in  I used it before I became a consultant PERIOD I believe in the product its all botanically based its Swiss heritage PERIOD I dont necessarily see myself as a saleswoman I dont get upset if someone doesnt buy my product Im just happy that I at least put it in someones head that this is a lifestyle. for Jones a mother of three and a yoga teacher running her Aloette franchise is a way to make additional revenue while being able to spend time with her family PERIOD

The great part of having a business like Aloette or Arbonne is that when youre busy and you have a family or a fulltime career you still have a reorder business she said PERIOD I love the flexibility I personally wouldnt be able to sit at a desk from  to . for college students like Laird working for a network marketing company like Arbonne can be a step forward professionally too PERIOD

I want to have a comfortable lifestyle and I think having a job like this will give me the opportunity to do that Laird said PERIOD I definitely see myself building my business in the next four years and even after that too PERIOD If I can get to one of the top level where Im making  or more a month then it could possibly be my fulltime job. according to the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations network marketing is a  billion industry in the United States PERIOD This number is larger than global sales in the video gaming movie and natural foods industries PERIOD Arbonne and Aloette parties might just be replacing the Tupperware party PERIOD
