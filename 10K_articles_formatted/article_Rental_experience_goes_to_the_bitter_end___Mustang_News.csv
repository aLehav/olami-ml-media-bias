Cal Poly San Luis Obispos News Source

Last spring I published an article detailing my struggles with my previous realestate management company McNamara Realty PERIOD I received an overwhelming amount of support and as I suspected I was not alone in my struggle PERIOD At the time my piece was published many things regarding my rental situation were unknown and pending PERIOD Nearly nine months later however McNamara is finally out of my life and I thought it might be pertinent to share how my experience turned out PERIOD



Upon moving out of our rental which was secured through McNamara my roommates and I secured alternative housing in a house we love a wonderful change PERIOD But our problems with McNamara did not end there PERIOD

Our first issue came from a disagreement concerning our leasetermination day with McNamara PERIOD When McNamara initially offered to end our lease early they did not specify any conditions i.e PERIOD a notice of seven days etc PERIOD Thus my roommates and I accepted this unconditional offer and moved out as soon as possible PERIOD

We had paid in full for the entire month rent was due on the first and moved out five days early PERIOD Due to the circumstances surrounding our moveout my roommate and I believed we were owed a prorated sum for the time we had paid for but would not use PERIOD

McNamara did not see things this way  the realty group was doing us a favor by allowing us to move out early PERIOD And many visits and phone calls did nothing in the way of resolving this issue PERIOD

Additionally upon vacating the property my roommate and I returned our keys and parking permits and we were sure to receive documentation proving so PERIOD We also took in a written letter detailing the time and date of our moveout as well as asserting that we were allocating  days as determined by California law for the return of our security deposit and the prorated rent PERIOD If  days passed with no response we informed McNamara that we would proceed to litigation PERIOD

Unfortunately McNamara failed to respond PERIOD My roommate Annie Schiowitz and I then filed a claim with the San Luis Obispo small claims department for a sum of more than  PERIOD About a week later we received our court date for late August and then had nothing to do but wait PERIOD

In the meantime McNamara returned our security deposits claiming they were late because we had not provided a forwarding address PERIOD Note receiving most of our deposits back lessened our claim to the  range PERIOD Included with the deposits were lists detailing deductions incurred during our residency PERIOD These ranged from carpet cleaning to soot in the fireplace to dust on the windowsills to failure to return parking permits PERIOD With the exception of carpet cleaning all deductions were fabricated PERIOD

On Aug PERIOD   Schiowitz and I met at the Veterans Hall in San Luis Obispo to present our claim PERIOD The small claims system in San Luis Obispo emphasizes mediation over litigation and we were encouraged to meet with the McNamara representatives first to try to resolve our problems on our own PERIOD

Unsurprisingly we were unable to resolve our matter with mediation  McNamara did not agree we were entitled to much of anything PERIOD Thus we presented our case to the judge and were rewarded compensation for our security deductions prorated rent and were granted a lump sum resulting from the neglect McNamara bestowed on us during our tenancy primarily with regards to the mold problem which totaled  PERIOD

I am sharing this story not to boast that we won against McNamara Realty PERIOD Rather I am sharing this story to illustrate that students have rights when it comes to renting PERIOD California tenant law covers a lot of ground and students are entitled to much more than they may be aware PERIOD

Cal Poly has a lawyer that comes to campus every other week to meet with students for free and to discuss legal proceedings and answer related questions PERIOD Cal Poly also has a multitude of professors and instructors with legal backgrounds that are willing to help PERIOD Christopher Perello a business professor at Cal Poly was a godsend for me PERIOD He met with me whenever he could to spell out my rights and assist in the process of getting to court PERIOD

The only way to change your situation is to be proactive and to educate yourself PERIOD If you think you are being mistreated and abused by your landlord dont be afraid to speak up PERIOD Always try to resolve things on your own if possible I wish we had been able to but dont shy away from legal action if you cannot find an adequate resolution PERIOD

I hope no one else goes through the hell we did with McNamara Realty though I fear we will not be the last PERIOD If you do however I hope I can motivate you to act PERIOD
