2772,2007-10-25,"with the NFL college football and the World Series all playing simultaneously the NBA might be the last thing on sports fans minds right now PERIOD But to many of the one billionplus inhabitants of China basketball is the biggest deal in town all the time PERIOD

This was certainly the case last week when two NBA preseason games between the Orlando Magic and Cleveland Cavaliers took place in the cities of Shanghai and Macao PERIOD When watching the first of the two games on ESPN I got the sense that Chinese fans were genuinely excited to watch an exhibition match between two mediocre Eastern Conference teams PERIOD

Just like in America LeBron James was the big draw for the crowd PERIOD Every time he touched the ball regardless of what he did with it cheers would erupt from the stands PERIOD And they didnt seem to choose sides either PERIOD Whenever a point was scored fans could be heard applauding politely even if it was a role player like Ira Newble or Donyell Marshall PERIOD It wasnt important who won PERIOD It was just important that the NBA had made its way to China PERIOD

Obviously the Chinese arent completely unfamiliar with the sport PERIOD They have had professional teams for years and now call one of the NBAs biggest stars their own PERIOD With Yao Mings success in America and the Milwaukee Bucks recently drafting Yi Jianlian China may become as big in the NBA as the NBA is in China PERIOD

I had the wonderful opportunity to visit the country for three weeks this summer and I was amazed at the extent to which the NBA in particular and basketball in general has permeated the Chinese culture PERIOD In the capital city of Beijing which will play host to next years Olympics American advertisements could be found everywhere with basketball as a common selling point PERIOD

One Adidas ad on a major Beijing street featured the Wizards Gilbert Arenas and a Nike billboard featured several Chinese teens dribbling the rock PERIOD In Shanghai the host of the CavsMagic game one shopping mall had entire Adidas and Nike stores with jerseys and shoes of NBAers Kevin Garnett and Tracy McGrady PERIOD Maybe its because he looks like a 7foot6 Frankenstein but Yao Ming surprisingly didnt have the star appeal to sell in his native land PERIOD

A basketball court in downtown Beijing also carried the Nike swoosh all over PERIOD Players pay their money to secure a court for a certain amount of time and then play the game they love amidst the backdrop of Garnett and Dwyane Wade looking on from a Gatorade poster PERIOD Gotta love commercialism PERIOD

At schools and universities in Chinas larger cities many students favor basketball over any other sport opting to hit the blacktop over the soccer pitch PERIOD I had the chance to play a pickup game with several Chinese kids and they could definitely ball PERIOD They all had their favorite player Tim Duncan and TMac were shockingly more popular choices than Yao and emulated their styles in our friendly scrimmage PERIOD

One of the kids even went so far in his NBA fandom as to memorize information about certain players including what team they play for and what year they were drafted PERIOD Just to test his knowledge I asked about a few obscure players PERIOD I was definitely surprised when the student knew exactly who LaPhonso Ellis played for and when Rashad McCants was drafted PERIOD

It was at this point that I realized the NBA had arrived in the Peoples Republic and wont be leaving anytime soon PERIOD

For the Chinese nation there is a greater meaning associated with sports than the mere fun and game of it PERIOD As a nation that has been behind the rest of the world in nearly every imaginable aspect China has taken great pride in finally catching up in the athletic arena PERIOD

Nothing exemplifies this quite like the upcoming  Olympic Games PERIOD In the United States most citizens take it for granted when our country plays host to one of the most prestigious global sporting events PERIOD In the past  years the U.S PERIOD has housed four Olympics PERIOD When the torch reaches Beijing in  it will be the communist countrys first PERIOD

In the host city you cannot turn your head without seeing some hint that the Olympics are quickly approaching PERIOD In the modern parts of town entire stores sell Olympic memorabilia to tourists and natives alike PERIOD Signs and ads for the games are everywhere and clocks count down the days and hours until the opening ceremony PERIOD Even in the rural parts of Beijing you will find Chinese people excited and proud to have the Olympics coming to their city PERIOD

With the increased popularity of basketball in China plans are in the works to expand the NBAs presence there according to ESPN.com in what commissioner David Stern called the second NBA the NBA of China. this new Chinese subsidiary will not only increase the business of Sterns league but will continue to spread the basketball gospel to millions of Chinese ballers PERIOD

So basketball fans be prepared to see a lot more players like Yao and Yi in the NBA as the league continues to gain influence overseas PERIOD

And you might want to start brushing up on your Mandarin PERIOD

Tyler is a junior majoring in journalism PERIOD If you want some tutoring in Chinese he only took one semester but he can try to help with the basics if you contact him at emailprotected PERIOD
