OSU center Kassidy De Lapp  and forward Natasha Mack  celebrate during the Oklahoma State vs PERIOD Kansas womens basketball game on Saturday Jan PERIOD   at GallagherIba Arena in Stillwater PERIOD

Playing in a competitive Division I conference such as the Big  is no easy task PERIOD What might be even more difficult than playing in it though is not physically being able to PERIOD

Kassidy De Lapp a 6foot3 sophomore from El Dorado Hills Calif. has missed six conference games due to a wrist injury PERIOD Her last performance before her injury was against Iowa State on Jan PERIOD  a game in which she posted career highs of  points  minutes and eight field goals made PERIOD

Coach Jim Littell said even though De Lapp isnt perfectly healthy just having her presence on the court again will help the Cowgirls PERIOD

Shes smart about our scouts and understands what were trying to do at all times Littell said PERIOD

Despite not being able to play De Lapp has kept a positive mindset and found hope in her teams willingness to compete PERIOD

The Cowgirls first game without De Lapp was a twopoint victory on the road against nationallyranked West Virginia PERIOD

That was them solidifying that our team is deeper than I think we expected De Lapp said PERIOD For me I was just proud to see it PERIOD I was happy that they fought as much as they could and I think theyre still fighting. in addition to helping her through physical recovery the Cowgirls mentality and effort are still motivating De Lapp PERIOD

Now that Im back I feel like I have to prove to them that since they fought for me I can fight for them through pain and just keep grinding she said PERIOD

De Lapp although not  recovered has been practicing and preparing to face TCU on Sunday PERIOD The first matchup between the Cowgirls and Horned Frogs resulted in a fourpoint loss for an OSU team that played without De Lapp and Natasha Mack PERIOD

I appreciate that shes trying to play through it Littell said PERIOD But you know playing with one hand sometimes is a little difficult in this game. sundays competition against TCU will have more than just a physical aspect to it for De Lapp as she is mentally prepared for any challenge that comes her way PERIOD

I played them last year but theyre a different team now De Lapp said PERIOD Theyre smaller so I have to be ready bend my knees be able to slide and just step up when my team needs me to PERIOD I dont think Im starting but Ill be ready when they call me off the bench. sports.edocolly.com
