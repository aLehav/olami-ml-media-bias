The  swim season began Saturday at the Ute Natatorium and things could not have gone better for the Utes PERIOD

Both the men and women dominated their portions of the meet in convincing fashion as the U men outswam their Denver Pioneer counterparts by a  margin PERIOD The women also won in convincing fashion beating the womens side of the Denver team .. PERIOD The victory also means the women successfully avenged their only blemish of the previous season PERIOD

Standouts on the womens side would be Kelsey Patterson PERIOD Adrienne Coburn and Amber Walter and Allie McInturff said U head coach Mike Litzinger PERIOD

All four women won two events against Denver on Saturday PERIOD

The Utes were led by a cast of usual suspects in a meet where the Utes finished first in all but four swimming events PERIOD Andrew Cole cleaned up in the mens backstroke events finishing first in both the  and  races PERIOD David Maasberg also swept the freestyle sprint events by winning both the  and  races PERIOD

Theres not too many events that we didnt winI guess thats the point for us PERIOD Those times are solid for right now but now we need to gear up Litzinger said PERIOD

The men opened the season especially strong as they failed to finish first in only one swimming event PERIOD The men also finished first and second in almost half of their  races including two topthree sweeps in the  freestyle and  butterfly events PERIOD The Ute men also came within . of a second from sweeping the  backstroke as well PERIOD

The most telling sign of the mens dominance came in the  freestyle medley PERIOD The U mens A team won the race comfortably but it was the mens B team that came within . of a second from giving the men a surprising onetwo finish in the only relay event of the day for them PERIOD

The men also got strong efforts from a few new faces to the team PERIOD Seamus Alger and Adam Oliver showed why Litzinger thinks this is one of the deepest mens teams he has ever seen PERIOD Alger who is a freshman took home first place in the  IM and butterfly events PERIOD Oliver who is in his sophomore year finished first in the marathon races which were the  and  freestyle races PERIOD

Diving was the only event at which the men did not thoroughly handle Denver PERIOD The Ute divers did not come close to making Cody Stambauch or Aaron Freight sweat as the Pioneer stars took the mens 1meter and 3meter events respectively PERIOD

These meets are stepping stones to see where we are in our training Litzinger said PERIOD Were real pleased about where we are in our training right now. the womens swim team won the MWC title Feb PERIOD  in Provo PERIOD The women won five relays in the Beehive classic in Provo this weekend PERIOD
