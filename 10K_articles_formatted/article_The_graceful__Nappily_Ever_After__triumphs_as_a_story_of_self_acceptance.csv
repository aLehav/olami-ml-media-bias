Our culture is one saturated by antiquated sexist and Eurocentric perceptions of female beauty PERIOD Intertwined with this conception of physical perfection is hair more specifically straight hair which has prompted generations of AfricanAmerican women to alter their unique frizz and curl patterns to fit the mold of silky locks PERIOD With its wellconstructed protagonist engaging character relationships and profound relevant reflections about skewed societal guidelines for beauty Nappily Ever After simply cannot be passed off as just another chickflick even though it abides by many of the romcom genre conventions PERIOD

When Violet Sanaa Lathan Love  Basketball was a little girl she quickly learned that the only path to perfection was through straight hair PERIOD And she never forgot it PERIOD As an adult with a thriving career a doting and sexy boyfriend and long relaxed hair Violets life is nothing short of perfect PERIOD However when an eagerly anticipated proposal from her hunky beau Clint Ricky Whittle Austenland turns out to be a false alarm and leads to a messy breakup rainclouds begin to form over Violets flawless and straightlaced world PERIOD Struggling to get back into the dating pool and navigate lingering feelings for her ex Violetin a drunken craze makes a hasty and emotionallycharged decision to shave her head PERIOD At first regretful of her rash choice Violets definition of beauty begins to reshape itself when a trip to the salon to salvage her hairtroubles leads to an unexpected friendship with the sassy yet sweet Zoe Daria Johns Animator and a tentative romance with Zoes downtoearth father Will Lyriq Bent Shes Gotta Have It PERIOD

Part of what allows Nappily Ever After to find success is its ability to balance heftier topics with lighthearted moments PERIOD At the surface level Violets search for the right man can be passed off as akin to any female leads journey to love in any other romantic film PERIOD However what sets Nappily Ever After apart is its dissection of the impact of the male gaze on womens choices regarding their appearances PERIOD All her life Violet was taught both by the beauty industry and her mother that men only want women with long flowing tresses not afros and dreadlocks PERIOD Thus she styled her hair straight altering herself with the end goal of presenting herself the way she thought men found desirable PERIOD Through her dramatic hair transformation and healthy blossoming relationship with Will Violet finally starts to grasp the notion that a real man or at least any man worth her time will see her for who she is regardless of what does or doesnt grow out of her head PERIOD

Violets transformation by the end of the film is clear PERIOD Once insecure about her natural hair and allegiant to the flat iron Violet is no longer the same woman by the end of the film PERIOD For so many years water was Violets enemy as it had the power to ruin her painstakingly pressed locks within seconds PERIOD Newly empowered and unchained from anyones standards Violet lets it all go through her symbolic leap into a swimming pool literally drowning out years of lies that she has been told about her frizz her curls and her texture not being beautiful enough PERIOD

On its own straight hair isnt the problem PERIOD As is emphasized in the final moments of the film it is not that women should feel guilty or wrong for wanting to switch up their natural hair but rather that all women should feel confident in their choices to alter their looks with the knowledge that they are worthy of love and respect no matter what PERIOD
