Artist Paul Mullins has a fine eye for trailer trash and has explored this subject in various conditionsi.e. wrestling partying and other curious poses PERIOD

Currently at the Ambrosino Gallery in North Miami his new show Come an Git Yer Love is a peculiar drawing and ink study of humananimal relations PERIOD

Notwithstanding the shock value that it conveys one can look past the explicitness of the images and fathom how the artist delves into some unspoken impetuous instincts that lay deep in the murky abyss of our unconsciousobviously these arent necessarily urges to take part of sexual interactions with animals but rather impulses we may have that are brutish and animalistic our brash often erratic capriciousness PERIOD

Here  his Longhorn Me and You Baby left and Bite Roll on Blue Skies right are finely drawn and inked to display the primal emotion that must accompany them PERIOD  As a sensible viewer its wise not to take these images literally PERIOD They are pieces of art and are just the vision of one artist PERIOD

Call the gallery at  for more info PERIOD
