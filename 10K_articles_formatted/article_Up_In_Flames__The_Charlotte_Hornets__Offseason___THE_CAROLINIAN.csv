It seems like just a few moments ago reports were circulating that Kemba Walker was willing to take less than a maximum offer in order to remain in Charlotte PERIOD Now that Walker has departed by way of Boston the Hornets franchise was left scrambling to pick up the pieces from years of mismanagement and the results so far have not been very pretty PERIOD

In an ESPN article ranking the future of all  NBA teams the Hornets found themselves ranked at the very bottom PERIOD The team holds the shameful distinction of owning  of the last  last place finishes PERIOD

In spite of the franchises extremely bleak state Kemba never demanded a trade or give any indication that he wished to be moved PERIOD In fact when asked about the topic Walker has always said that he wished to remain with the team PERIOD For example when asked about potentially moving to a big market in a  interview Walker said These guys believed in me. he continued by saying I couldnt care less about big markets PERIOD Thats not who I am PERIOD I want to make this place big PERIOD I want to be in the playoffs every year PERIOD I want to make Charlotte pop. as free agency began to loom the Hornets were still considered the favorites for Walker PERIOD However that all changed when the front office only offered their AllStar point guard a fiveyear deal worth around  million dollars PERIOD Not only is that number  million shy of the maximum that Charlotte could have offered it is also worth around three million dollars less annualy than the deal Walker signed with the Celtics PERIOD

The front office justified its offer to Walker by stating that team owner Michael Jordan was unwilling to go into the luxury tax for a team that has failed to make the playoffs for the past three seasons which is understandable PERIOD However if this was the Hornets rationale all along then it makes no sense for the team to have not traded Kemba while he was still on arguably the most tradable contract in the league with a cap hit of only  million PERIOD A team like the Lakers in  would have loved to trade for Walker as they still would have owned the cap space to acquire LeBron James and another star PERIOD In fact a deal involving Walker in exchange for Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball was actually briefly discussed PERIOD

Instead the Hornets acquired Terry Rozier in a signandtrade deal with Boston involving Walker and a future second round pick for the Hornets PERIOD Rozier is coming off a poor season in Boston after failing to adjust to a bench role following his breakout in the  Playoffs filling in for the injured Kyrie Irving but still does offer some much needed help in the backcourt PERIOD

There is just one problem however Rozier was signed to a completely inexplicable threeyear58million dollar contract PERIOD Despite his amazing run as a starter Rozier has yet to produce a season of shooting above  percent from the field in any of his first four seasons PERIOD He was a reserve in his first two seasons and struggled mightily adopting back to a bench role in his last season PERIOD Paying players well above market value is the type of thing that leads the Hornets back to bottom of the Future Rankings year after year PERIOD No other competent team in the league would have given Terry Rozier that contract based on his body of work  PERIOD

Also departing from the team is second leading scorer Jeremy Lamb who signed a threeyeardeal with the Indiana Pacers and backup guard Tony Parker who decided to retire PERIOD

Rookie big man PJ Washignton will likely have trouble getting minutes at the four with Michael Kidd Gilchrist Marvin Wiiliams and Miles Bridges all needing minutes there PERIOD

In summary this offseason was about as close to a worstcase scenario as possible PERIOD The Hornets are projected by Vegas to be the worst team in theAssociation next season with an overunder of  wins PERIOD With no highend talent on the rosters as well as a lack of young players with star potential Charlotte is entering year one of it appears to be a monumental rebuild PERIOD
