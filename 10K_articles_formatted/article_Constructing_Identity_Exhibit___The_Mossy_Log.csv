After witnessing the first month of  it was made brutally obvious that this year and the years to come will focus on issues of identity PERIOD From the historic postinaugural Womens March to the shocking Muslim ban identities are being questioned and redefined like never before PERIOD The Portland Art Museum has chosen to address this issue head on the first exhibit opened this year is entitled Constructing Identity a collection of African American art from the Petrucci Family Foundation PERIOD This exhibition opened Jan PERIOD  and will remain open until Jun PERIOD  PERIOD

The exhibits diverse content was shocking PERIOD Pieces are incorporated from as early as  PERIOD More than  African American artists work is showcased and mediums vary from standard oil on canvas to bottlecaps and recycled materials PERIOD You could say this exhibit is a bit different from the repetitive Andy Warhol exhibit that had occupied the space previouslynot to mention the predominantly European Italian Renaissanceinspired exhibit across the hall PERIOD

This exhibits pieces have been categorized into six central themes abstraction community faces gender spirit and the land. as it is nearly impossible for me to review each piece in addition to that ruining all the fun I have decided to pick the piece I found most striking in each category to provide a snapshot of the gallery as a whole PERIOD

The museum defined abstraction as a series of songs without words or in another sense pieces showing the essence of African American culture PERIOD I found Marita Dinguss Blue Quilt the most captivating in this category PERIOD While I struggled to relate some abstraction pieces to African American culture the quilt demonstrated a key aspect of it along with its aesthetic appeal PERIOD

Next community focused on defining identity and how African Americans shaped  and were shaped  by America. when focusing on this theme I was torn between an ironic piece and a more sentimental one so I decided to include them both PERIOD One is entitled Afro Abe by Sonya Clark a mere five dollar bill with an afro drawn on it do with that what you will and Mattoon  by Debra Priestly consistenting of images of the artists own family in mason jars PERIOD

Moving on the faces theme strives to show the defining elements of African American faces in a culture where they are often deemed inferior PERIOD Nelson Stevens defies these cultural boundaries in his piece Spirit Sister using silkscreen to print vivid color on an African American womans face PERIOD

The works of the gender category were some of my favorite resisting stereotypical representations of Afican American woman in popular culture PERIOD Arvie Smiths Trapeze Artist is one of the exhibits defining pieces PERIOD Smith used his firsthand experience in the Jim Crow South to show the beautiful imperfections of an African American woman in vibrant oil colors PERIOD

The museum defines the spirit category as pieces that manifest in the openness to the ecstatic potency of being. interestingly these pieces focused less on making a social statement and more on entertainment PERIOD The deceased Gregory Warmarcks Guitar for example is made out of bottle caps and other recycled materials giving it a sort of bedazzled effect and making it one of the exhibits standout pieces PERIOD

The final category the land focuses on nature home and sense of place PERIOD Mickalene Thomass Landscape Majestic was the first piece to genuinely captivate me in the Museum PERIOD Thomas used a mix of woodblock silkscreen and digital print to collage images of nature and objects of symmetry together PERIOD In addition to the themed pieces Constructing Identity includes an educational community gallery entitled The Art is Ours. by partnering with Museum of Impact MOI the museum was able to create an interactive element for museumgoers there are more than  African American art history books and a community artistic response wall PERIOD Since the exhibit had just opened the exhibit was sparse at the time of attendance PERIOD I would however be interested to see what pieces fill it in the months to come PERIOD

The museum is working hard to include the community in this exhibit by whatever means possible PERIOD On Feb PERIOD  the event Constructing Identity Conversations of African American Art  Culture is being a held a twopart program bringing the collections curator and many featured artists together for panel discussions and gallery talks PERIOD In the context of  I believe this event could not be more relevant for LC PERIOD students and the Portland community as a whole PERIOD
