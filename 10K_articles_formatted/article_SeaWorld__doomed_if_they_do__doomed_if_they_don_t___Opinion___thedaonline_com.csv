Last week I wrote about the recent SeaWorld scandal PERIOD I couldnt help but notice the strong reaction the column received PERIOD While I am glad to be able to bring awareness to an issue Im passionate about I do feel responsible to address one concern brought to my attention PERIOD

Several readers expressed SeaWorld would never be forgiven by the public until it sets all of the orcas free and no longer has whales in captivity PERIOD

While I agree whales can only thrive in their natural environment people seem to forget there are hundreds of zoos currently holding wild animals in captivity as well PERIOD The captivity is not what should particularly enrage you PERIOD It is SeaWorlds mistreatment of these animals PERIOD

While the documentary Blackfish brings to light all of the reasons why whales should not be in captivity it also explains why SeaWorld could never free the whales as much as we all wish they would PERIOD

Orcas are family oriented creatures PERIOD They hunt together travel together and calves remain by their mothers side even though adulthood PERIOD As the film noted each pod has its own unique culture PERIOD Aside from exhibiting different languages each family develops a different diet and a killer whale never eats anything that it is not specifically taught to eat proving why these whales would never kill a human in the wild PERIOD

These orcas were caught at a very young age and many were born at the parks PERIOD These whales were stripped of any natural instinct they had PERIOD Even if they were set free these whales would not be able to survive on their own PERIOD They have been handfed their entire lives and were never taught how to hunt PERIOD

Keiko the star of Free Willey was set free in  returning to his native environment in the Atlantic Ocean after spending  years in captivity PERIOD Scientists tracked Keikos journey and although the whale had shown he could adjust to his new life for some time he died nearly a year after his release PERIOD

To put it into perspective imagine setting your family pet free PERIOD Fido would not stand a chance on the streets mainly because he would not know how to hunt for his own food PERIOD And why would he

The same goes for these whales PERIOD They have become SeaWorlds pets and the corporation is ultimately doomed if they set the whales free and doomed if they dont PERIOD It is sad but true PERIOD

Former SeaWorld trainer Samantha Berg suggested in the film that these whales should be released to live out the remainder of their lives in an open ocean pen and I completely agree PERIOD The open ocean pen is a great compromise because it would allow the whales to live in their natural environment while not jeopardizing their lives PERIOD

If you are truly advocating for the wellbeing of these animals setting the whales free is not a realistic solution PERIOD The public needs to begin focusing its energy on an alternative way to provide these creatures the lives they deserve to live PERIOD
