The No PERIOD  Massachusetts womens lacrosse team successfully became Atlantic  champions after dominating Saint Josephs  Sunday PERIOD

UMass   A10 earned itself an automatic qualifier to the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

Kelly Marra commenced the scoring for the Minutewomen scoring three goals PERIOD Marra has a total of  goals for the season PERIOD

I think once we started moving more offball and had some nice assisted goals I think thats when we started to find our rhythm a lot more head coach Angela McMahon said postgame PERIOD This is key for us because it involves a lot more people in the offense and when we come together and everyone is involved we are hard to stop. todays game would not have been as successful if it werent for a draw specialist Caitlyn Petro PERIOD The ability to gain possession and emerge from the draw came at ease for UMass PERIOD Petro contributed  of the  successful draw controls the Minutewomen had today having another historic type of performance PERIOD Petro had the help of Stephanie Croke and together led the Hawks  in draw controls PERIOD

UMass collectively was more confident on offense than it had been in Fridays game against Davidson PERIOD In the first half Olivia Muscella Kaitlyn Cerasi Croke Haley Connaughton and Marra supplied six goals in the span of just five and a half minutes PERIOD The Minutewomen had the ability to find the openings on net and place the ball for a  lead closing out the half PERIOD

Cerasi is so steady for us even when we are struggling or not shooting well she is just a consistent presence specifically in terms of her physical game but she also rubs off on others with her leadership skills McMahon said of Cerasis efforts PERIOD The type of passion she puts out there rubs off on the team and helps us get momentum. with under  minutes left in the second half UMass commanded a 10point lead over SJU PERIOD The Minutewomen were in mercy rule territory and the clock ran continuously for the last  minutes PERIOD

I think its confidence in the preparation you know its all the days and the practices and film sessions and lifts and all of that is where the confidence comes from McMahon said of UMass increased confidence in todays game PERIOD It is about how we prepare but I think we prepared well PERIOD Obviously there have been some obstacles this year but I think that we did not let that derail or distract us from the ultimate goal which is to win. the Minutewomen are the powerhouse of the A10 and ended with a perfect home record PERIOD Six of the players were recognized as the AllChampionship team Muscella Connaughton Petro Croke Lauren Hiller and Cerasi PERIOD

This upcoming Sunday the NCAA womens lacrosse bracket will be released and UMass will continue its season PERIOD
