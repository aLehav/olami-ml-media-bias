When looking for an internship it is important to find one that teaches multiple skills PERIOD At ESMS I have learned event planning social media business writing and more in addition to the typical marketing internship networking advertising etc PERIOD One thing that drew me to ESMS was the close relationship they have with West Chester University PERIOD Since the program began in  ten of the  interns have been from WCU PERIOD Cynthia Ericson the owner of Ericson Strategic Marketing Solutions wants us specifically and is actively on West Chester Universitys campus presenting to various organizations about her company as well as business and professional tips PERIOD

There are some questions you have to ask yourself when deciding on an internship PERIOD Are you looking to receive course credit for your participation Or simply personal experience I am at ESMS for personal experience but the option to work for course credit is available PERIOD You also have to ask yourself if you are willing to intern without monetary compensation PERIOD Fortunately more and more companies are offering internships that do pay PERIOD Here at ESMS it is all about the timing of your application PERIOD Generally there are two to three interns and one is a paid position PERIOD While ESMS is a revenue based company about  percent of the work we do here is for non profit work PERIOD That is also something to consider when deciding on an internship PERIOD Does the company only focus on profit or do they give back to the community Social responsibility is extremely important to me so I was willing to take the unpaid internship for a semester if it meant the community as a whole was benefiting from it PERIOD
