4989,2023-11-04,"the researchers reviews were published in a special biodiversity edition of the academic journal Nature PERIOD

by  Sydney BaumHainesPublished  June  

About  years ago David Tilman began to explore biodiversitys importance PERIOD

Working with the University of Minnesotas Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve Tillman and other researchers first thought they would find some significance but underestimated just how important it is PERIOD

Biodiversity matters immensely much more than we ever imagined he said PERIOD

Today Tilman reviews how human growth has historically affected biodiversity PERIOD With that data he predicted a bleak future for Africas mammals and birds PERIOD His review published in the June  biodiversity issue of the scientific journal Nature PERIOD

Its now common knowledge to researchers that biodiversity is important in ecosystems PERIOD Diverse species essentially let ecosystems work better on every level  they become more productive and resistant to invasive species PERIOD

An ecosystem is comparable to human society Tilman said who is now a University Regents professor in the Department of Ecology Evolution and Behavior PERIOD Each species has a certain role akin to people with specific jobs Tillman said PERIOD

When ecosystems lose diversity theyre basically losing these longterm evolved professions  and therefore with those they dont perform as well Tilman said PERIOD

His review for Naturepredicted a population explosion  in Africa and continued poor agricultural practices which puts several species facetoface with high risks of extinction PERIOD

Tilman worked with Craig Packer director of the Universitys Lion Research Center on the review PERIOD

Packer said most research focuses on past and present issues in biodiversity PERIOD

What we wanted to point out is that theres a pressing need to anticipate and deal with the expected growth in human populations especially in Africa he said PERIOD

Weighing human costs

The population boom in Africa will mean more mouths to feed Tillman said and more land cleared for farming PERIOD

Clearing land is the main way humans cause species extinction PERIOD

But protecting land without addressing why people use it is immoral he said PERIOD

With conservation you really do have to keep in mind whats going on with the people who live there as well Packer said PERIOD

Tilmans main solution to this issue is to increase efficiency of farmland PERIOD With farming practices like using better seed and fertilizer populations can keep land usage low for their food production PERIOD

However the countries where this is needed most lack the funding and education to properly institute these changes he said PERIOD

Those practices can increase the food production so much that most African nations would never need to clear any land even though they might have three or four or five times their current food demand he said PERIOD

Tilman and Packer suggested other ways to tackle this problem could be made through societal diet changes or by changing how countries trade crops PERIOD

If a developed country like the U.S PERIOD were to cut its consumption of animal products like meat and eggs it would open the door to export more crops to underdeveloped countries Tillman said PERIOD

Certain areas of the world are better for growing certain crops Tillman said PERIOD

If these highyield countries exported to lowyield countries whose existing cropland could be used for bettersuited crops they think it could decrease the amount of land needed to feed the worlds population he said PERIOD

Biodiversitys complex human connection

Alongside Tilmans review in Nature Forest Isbell associate director of the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve published a review of how humans benefit from biodiversity even as their practices harm it PERIOD

Human practices like nutrient pollution overharvesting animal populations and introducing invasive species can all harm biodiversity  along with humans role in climate change Isbell said PERIOD

Isbell said biodiversity aids humans by contributing to what scientists call ecosystem services like the production of wood crops and fish PERIOD

Economically this means humans can invest financially into conserving biodiversity and see returns from the increased productivity of these services he said PERIOD

Its quite clear that human activities are undermining our ability to continue receiving these benefits from nature said Isbell who is also a professor in the Department of Ecology Evolution and Behavior PERIOD

Isbells review found the benefits of preserving land are greater than the benefits of turning land into cropland economically PERIOD

Preserved land slows the effects of climate change better than cropland he said PERIOD

The adverse effects of climate change include rising sea levels and disruption of fisheries  both of which are more costly than they are worth he said PERIOD

A hopeful future

Both Isbell and Tilmans reviews glanced into the future and found some hope PERIOD

Isbell said there is a long delay between when a habitat is disturbed and when the last individual of a species dies PERIOD

Tilmans review noted that if the efficiency of farming practices across the world improve there would be enough food to feed a global population of  billion without massive damage to biodiversity PERIOD

We can act over the next few decades and restore ecosystems increase the abundances of these species and give them a good chance of persisting Isbell said PERIOD
