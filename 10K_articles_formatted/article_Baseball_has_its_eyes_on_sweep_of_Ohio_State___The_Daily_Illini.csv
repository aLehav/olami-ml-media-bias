2320,2023-10-26,"i suppose I should put some pants on Justin Parr said peeking his head out from behind the brick wall of Illinois clubhouse PERIOD

The Illini baseballs star outfielder laughed his way back into the locker room to retrieve pants to pull over his compression shorts before addressing the media Wednesday at Illinois Field delaying the inevitable questions regarding his careerbest hitting streak which extended to  games in Illinois  mercyrule win against Illinois State PERIOD

The Illinois baseball team is loose as evident by Parrs actions and confident in its play as of late particularly at the plate PERIOD Every starter recorded a hit in Tuesdays win  Illinois fourth straight overall with it notching double figures in hits in each of those wins PERIOD

The Illini   Big Ten will look to carry the success from their win over the Redbirds and recent sweep of Purdue into this weekends threegame series against Ohio State   PERIOD

We feel pretty confident with where were at Parr said PERIOD Offensively we arent striking out which is something we struggled with at the beginning of the year PERIOD We put a lot of pressure on the defense. illinois has its eyes on a sweep after dropping games it feels it should have won earlier in the season PERIOD But the Buckeyes pose a greater challenge than the Redbirds who ranked sixth in the Missouri Valley Conference and Purdue which entered last weekend last in the Big Ten in ERA PERIOD

The Buckeyes rotation features a flurry of powerpitching righthanders that rank second in the conference with a . team ERA PERIOD Ohio State is also tied for second in the Big Ten in opposing batting average holding opponents to . on the season PERIOD

Looking to equalize the Buckeyes will be Kevin Johnson Illinois No PERIOD  starter and owner of a  record and . eRA PERIOD Johnson struggled in his last outing against Purdue allowing five runs in uncharacteristic five innings and will look to rebound in what the statistics suggest should be a pitchers duel Friday PERIOD

I like playing better teams than the ones going into the weekend youre going to beat Johnson said PERIOD You got to be perfect basically PERIOD Thats not putting pressure on ourselves its just doing what we do. johnson is   innings away from setting Illinois career inningspitched record PERIOD He will look to do so in a rematch of last years Friday night matchup against Jaron Long  . who will once again take the mound for Purdue PERIOD Johnson got the win last year on the way to the Illinis  series win PERIOD

Illinois will supersede the Buckeyes for fifth place in the conference standings with a sweep PERIOD That would put the Illinis winning streak at seven games with perhaps Parr extending his hitting streak to   just one game shy of tying Ryan Snowdens schoolrecord streak of  set in  PERIOD

In other words an accomplishment almost worthy of wearing pants PERIOD
