In  at the age of  my mother emigrated to America from Poland PERIOD Knowing neither how to read nor write in English she was fortunate enough to obtain a job as a seamstress in a factory in New York City as was also true for my father who emigrated to America from Lithuania years earlier PERIOD

Being employed in the garment industry during the time its workers were members of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union they were able to provide decent food clothing shelter and even offer a college education to their four sons PERIOD Prior to the time that the ILGWU won its longstanding battle to engage in collective bargaining with owners and management in the garment industry its factories were known for exploitation of workers in the forms of low wages unsafe working conditions and sexual harassment PERIOD

In  the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire in NYC caused the deaths of  women girls and  men from the fire itself smoke inhalation or jumping to their death PERIOD It demonstrated to the world that without employees having a strong voice to represent their best interests in the workplace similar tragedies would occur spurring the growth of the ILGWU PERIOD

In  Addie Wyatt a leader in the United States Labor movement and a civil rights activist known for being the first AfricanAmerican woman elected international vice president of a major labor union under the leadership of President Mike Alexandroff was awarded an honorary degree PERIOD By doing so Columbia affirmed its longstanding commitment to all who work within its walls to be respected treated fairly and afforded fair and equitable remuneration for services rendered to the college PERIOD

In early February President and CEO KwangWu Kim informed the college community I appreciate the commitment of our faculty and staff to staying true to our mission  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD we have continued delivering a vibrant educational experience for our students PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD As part of recognizing these efforts the college is issuing a onetime discretionary bonus to fulltime faculty and NonUnion fulltime faculty and NonUnion parttime staff  PERIOD  PERIOD . true to our mission. certainly not to the mission of Columbia to deliver a vibrant educational experience for our students when a college president is awarded a compensation package of  and denies awarding a bonus to ALL Columbia employees union as well as nonunion integral to the colleges being an institution of HIGHER education PERIOD By doing so it is teaching students a kind of vibrancy where greed is good and joining together with others in pursuit of the common good will not be tolerated by the powersthatbe and each person looking out for ones own interests is the road to walk on PERIOD

True to our mission Certainly not to one of the basic aspects of the mission that Columbia was founded upon   PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD affording its student body the opportunity to reach out beyond self familial societal and cultural limitations and barriers in the pursuit of finding ones own voice and JOINING with others to be the authors of ones time. true to our mission. by excluding union faculty and staff from receiving an equitable bonus for the services they render unto to college is nothing less than a blatant attempt by the Administration to instruct the Columbia community the lesson if you join a union you will be punished as well as being another step taken by the present college Administration to break the union and for the college to become more and more of an autocracy PERIOD

When honored by Columbia Addie Wyatt told those present Each of us is a link in this great union chain that stretches around the world PERIOD I will try every day to keep my link united active and strong. if Addie Wyatt were alive today she would say to President and CEO KwangWu Kim Shame on you PERIOD You are breaking the chain that ties Columbia together PERIOD
