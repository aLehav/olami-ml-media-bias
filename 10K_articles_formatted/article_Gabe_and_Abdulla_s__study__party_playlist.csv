5266,2016-03-09,"in the words of supreme orator and learned philosopher YG I just wanna party Unfortunately these dreams of letting loose are becoming increasingly hard to realize in the face of final projects and exams PERIOD Heres a playlist for your homework party for when youre desperately trying to finish a problem set by the  p.m PERIOD deadline for when youre trying to cram  weeks of Physics EM into two days for when youre hitting the gym hard the morning of your exam to feel some semblance of control over your own fate PERIOD

The playlist httpswww.youtube.complaylistlistPLE0vOSM3Jhf8fbfh1gZ8vhDfSzRs73eh

Make sure to open the playlist in its own separate window so it autoplays PERIOD We realize YouTube playlists kinda suck but there isnt any one streaming service that consistently has all the songs we want to include PERIOD

Know Ya  Ty Dolla ign feat PERIOD Trey Songz

Heeeeey Ty its Gabe and Abdulla again PERIOD After an extended introduction from a presumably fictional neglected angry lover who identifies herself as Precious Know Ya thumps thumps thumps in characteristic MetroBoominproduced fashion PERIOD Much like Precious herself we really feel that this song has been overlooked PERIOD Featuring Trey Songz Know Ya certainly has the potential to become this summers anthem PERIOD

Hard For  Kevin Gates

Hard For well goes hard PERIOD Seeminglyhollow and frankly misogynistic lyrics aside Kevin Gates  holder of a masters degree in Psychology and a score of  on the ACT  certainly takes a more raw wild approach to his music than do many of his contemporaries PERIOD Despite his perpetuation of overused rap themes like mistrust misogyny and hustling Gates forcefully sheds many of the other rules that typically shackle contemporary rappers even fixing a guitar instrumental over the thumping rhythm of Hard For. personal Jesus  Depeche Mode

Though Kanye will always be our personal Jesus Depeche Modes  wildwest hit Personal Jesuss unforgiving bluesy guitar riffs and catchy drum lines will take you to church PERIOD Personal Jesus fittingly comes just after the clonking guitardriven Hard For and just before Rihannas urban cowboy Desperado see below PERIOD

I dont even really understand what a saloon is but after listening to this song Im pretty sure I want to go to one PERIOD

Desperado  Rihanna

Rihanna stumbles  perhaps inadvertently  upon a new edgy wildwest sound with Desperado. its not hard to imagine darker rapper Travi Scott mancrush of Gabe and new boyfriend of Rihanna having a hand in the sultry confident Desperado. the songs producer Mike Schultz sums up the style of the song perfectly If you listen to the record its got an alternative vibe but still has urban undertones but its guitar and dirty live bass. in many ways edgy selfassured Desperado perfectly mirrors the way in which Rihannas latest album ANTI was confidently released with little of the hype or warning that typically precedes releases from bigname artists PERIOD

Off the Chair  Pham feat PERIOD Mayowa

Off the Chair masterfully blends the deep housetrap aesthetic with flowing unafraid rapvocals PERIOD There is very little information available on the internet about Pham PERIOD We know hes a producer out of Poland PERIOD We know this is one song off of his recent EP Movements and that this song features Nigerian rapper Mayowa who we note sounds eerily like a more confident even angry Drake PERIOD And we know that Pham boldlyyetthoughtfully combines and an orgasmic house beat with strong bars from Yung Fusion and that we like it PERIOD

One Touch  Bauuer feat PERIOD Rae Sremmurd and Alunageorge

No hype playlist is complete without the dirtysouth influence of Rae Sremmurd the rowdy hiphop duo composed of brothers Swae Lee and Slim Jimmy from Tupelo Mississippi PERIOD Much like Off the Chair One Touch represents a brave combination of hyphy hiphop and dubsteptrap music juxtaposing hardhitting bass lines and verses of traditional rap with powerful synthheavy instrumentals and distant female vocals from Alunageorge who performed at Frost last year PERIOD

Trust Me Danny  ILOVEMAKONNEN

Much like the Weeknd Makonnen occupies a unique space in music that combines synthheavy trap and highoctave RB one that makes real moves towards meaningful crossover into pop PERIOD In a call to his longtime producer Danny Wolf Makonnens wobbly high register cruises over an upbeat undeniably anthemesque melody and a thumping bass line leaving Trust Me Danny feeling both heavy and weightless PERIOD

Panda  Desiigner

Hardhitting Panda should certainly sound familiar Our Lord and Savior himself Kanye samples Panda on Father Stretch My Hands Pt PERIOD  from his newest project The Life of Pablo. perhaps due to Desiigners young age  he just recently celebrated his eighteenth birthday  Panda refreshingly lacks the restraint that many rappers now exercise in this era of experimental meticulouslycurated projectrap PERIOD Though Desiigner shamelessly bites read rips off Future both in sound and in subject he frequently namedrops Atlanta the home of Future we are super excited to see what Desiigner brings to us next PERIOD And apparently so is Kanye just days prior to The Life of Pablos release Kanye officially signed Desiigner to his record label Good Music PERIOD

Ta Fte  Stromae

BelgianRwandan artist Stromae is perhaps best known for hits Alors on Danse and Papaoutai. these songs work by flipping unexpected sounds on their head to create confusion while his lyrics seek to enlighten PERIOD These features are encapsulated in Ta Fte. alone each of the distinct instrumentals sound like screeches that you made in primary school to piss off that one teacher that you knew already hated her life PERIOD Together they create an insane masterpiece PERIOD In the famous Stromae fashion every verse invites interpretation ta fte itself means to throw a party but also to get into a fight PERIOD If youre looking for a little of that Fk up some commas effect Ta Fte is the classy way to get there PERIOD

Calm Down  GEazy

In this short verseheavy number off of young Geralds December release When Its Dark Out shameless shittalking and plans of doing drugs and having sex with certain celebrities fit perfectly with the Tygaesque hightempo nightclub instrumental PERIOD Say what you want about cheesy cocky GEazy but this song is a banger PERIOD

Sock It  Me  Missy Elliot Kaytranada Remix

Missy wasnt lying this song definitely has our hormones jumping like a disco. in this playlists third rapelectronic hybrid Sock It  Me pairs the proud rapping voice of Missy Elliot with the sweeping traprave aesthetic or how we imagine a rave sounds since were too afraid to attend one of Kaytranada who interestingly was another performer at last years Frost festival PERIOD At  seconds the uncompromising beat drop will sock it to you too PERIOD

Wonderful  Travi Scott

Much like Drugs You Should Try It upbeat Wonderful doesnt feel like the work of the darker 808sinspired Travis that told Drop.fm in a  interview that he likes to record his music in the dark PERIOD Deviating once again from the hardhitting sound that typically characterizes southern rap Houstonnative Travi Scott masterfully incorporates Autotune coupled with a mean falsetto hook from the Weeknd to create an almost hypnotic sound in Wonderful PERIOD Unlike the simultaneouslyreleased track ATeam which warns listeners not to try to play us Wonderful invites listeners to celebrate the wonderfulness of the time in which we find ourselves PERIOD Oh my what a wonderful time indeed PERIOD

Danger  Vic Mensa

Admittedly we recognize that youre probably not going to like this song PERIOD But Danger is appealing for that reason alone it feels dangerous PERIOD Its unsurprisingly the very song that made the entire Yeezy Season crowd convened at Madison Square Gardens uncomfortable PERIOD Its breathless PERIOD Its aggressive PERIOD Its irreverent PERIOD Its South Side PERIOD This song is the neck tattoo of music the song that screams skrrrrrrrt Its crazy to think about how many times I used to see this selfdescribed hooligan around the Hyde Park neighborhood where I went to high school PERIOD

BONUS TRACK Kiss  Prince

Say whaaaat Princes funky falsetto flamboyant guitar riffs and groovy saxophone interlude are perfect for getting the people going PERIOD Released in  the same year in which Prince released his feature filmsoundtrack Purple Rain Kiss offers a playful jazzy departure from this more modern heavy playlist PERIOD Unfortunately as part of his ongoing suit against multiple major streaming services Prince has elected to remove all of his music from YouTube PERIOD So for those of you who have made the exceedingly wise choice to read this far heres the song httpvideos.sapo.ptKOvn6OC2wfpWz9aTDSAM PERIOD
