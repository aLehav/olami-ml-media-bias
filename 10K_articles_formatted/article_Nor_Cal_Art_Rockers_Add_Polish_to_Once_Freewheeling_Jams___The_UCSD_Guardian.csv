Deerhoof Vs PERIOD Evil
Polyvinyl

Critics love to praise bands by saying they have their own sound but few have earned the designation to the extent of San Francisco avantrock powerhouse Deerhoof PERIOD The animal drumming of founder Greg Saunier offsets singer Satomi Matsuzakis cutebutdeadly vocals as the band navigates a fusion of psychedelia 70s funk and electronica PERIOD

Ten stunning albums in Deerhoof extend their spectacularly diverse career with Deerhoof Vs PERIOD Evil PERIOD Absent is the dry improvisational whimsy of The Runners Four PERIOD Deerhoof have opted for a tamer more deliberate approach and the product is alltoooften disappointing PERIOD

The most obvious departure from the groups past work is the albums meticulous production PERIOD The alien percussion and synthetic bleeps on opener Qui Dorm Nomes Somia rise to a focused midtempo jam that regrettably avoids the bands signature chaos PERIOD Even Matsuzaki sounds unfamiliar her typical squeaky imperfections are drowned out by an overdubbed chorus PERIOD

But much of Deerhoof Vs PERIOD Evil simply feels tired PERIOD Behold a Marvel in the Darkness opens with a pleasant acoustic guitar driven verse that drags along painfully interrupted by an occasional surge of noise PERIOD The jangling stomp of Hey I Can loses its charm halfway into a driving climax of cuckoo clock sounds and monosyllabic chirping PERIOD

Occasionally Evils focus on songwriting pays off PERIOD Single Super Duper Rescue Heads provides a catchy pop refrain over exuberant percussion and synthesizer PERIOD Secret Mobilization captures some of the bands hardhitting guitarjam gold just before the album descends into its maddeningly lousy conclusion PERIOD

You have to hand it to Deerhoof   years into one of indie rocks most erratic discographies theyve made their most unexpected move to date a flat forgettable album PERIOD But although Deerhoof Vs PERIOD Evil dwells heavily in murky misfires it does offer enough moments of explorative sparkle to keep us awaiting the bands next release in headscratching anticipation PERIOD
