4122,2017-04-27,"in the 1970s director Martin Scorsese burst into the film industry with a promising future PERIOD Collaborating with actor Robert De Niro on works such as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver the duo consolidated their strong directoractor relationship early on in their careers PERIOD This collaboration lasted well into their respective careers  their big collaboration film of the 80s is the nowclassic Raging Bull PERIOD

Based on the reallife story of boxer Jake LaMotta Raging Bull recounts various fights and life events that marked the rise and fall of the renowned boxer PERIOD On Thursday April  UCSBs CarseyWolf Center hosted makeup artist and UCSB alumnus Michael Westmore to discuss the making of the movie with film and media studies professor Anna Brusutti PERIOD

During the QA discussion after the screening of the film Brusutti remarked that one of the main themes in the film is the idea of violence PERIOD During the first match of the film Scorsese hints at the violent nature of the boxing matches that will influence LaMottas personal life PERIOD In the first boxing match alone the hectic nature of the event suggests that the audience demands to see this violence for their own enjoyment PERIOD At the beginning of the film the audience already knows that LaMotta has a violent side as he displays a verbal attack and small physical one toward somebody early on the film PERIOD While a montage later in the film can be interpreted as a passage of time it could also suggest a part of his life when his violent nature began to slowly build inside in context of this theme as suggested by the various fights interlaced into the sequence PERIOD Ultimately Scorsese also proves that violence is an endless cycle that can influence others to act similarly PERIOD

Most of this is demonstrated through LaMottas personality and De Niros portrayal PERIOD As a character LaMotta is brutal in the ring yet controlling outside PERIOD Its almost as if Scorsese is trying to make the point that LaMotta was a product of a society that wanted him to beat people mercilessly to gain acceptance from them PERIOD As a result LaMotta exerted complete control over those he loved as demonstrated when he questioned any time his second wife Vickie Cathy Moriarty kissed other men as a form of greeting or remarked that someone was simply goodlooking PERIOD

While LaMottas character on paper would be enough to show this change it was De Niros dedication to the role that made the finished performance more meaningful PERIOD Westmore remarked De Niro trained so thoroughly that trainers were saying He could actually go into the ring and he probably would win. while it is commonly accepted for actors to fully dedicate themselves to a certain role such as weight loss Westmore reminisced on various times when De Niro would want the most minute parts of his character to be as accurate as possible PERIOD

In one aspect of filming the movie De Niro wanted his hair to look like LaMottas instead of wearing a wig PERIOD Westmore explained spending hours trying to rearrange De Niros hair to look as accurate as possible PERIOD For one scene Brusutti noted a discontinuity in the flow of the scene which involved confetti PERIOD Both Scorsese and De Niro wanted to keep the confetti on LaMottas face and the scene ended up taking  days to shoot because Westmore had to put confetti on De Niros face every shoot PERIOD

While De Niros performance helped note the certain points of LaMottas life that led him to a violent path the sound in the film was used well to make audience members hear the impact of his destructiveness PERIOD One can hear all the punches hit as the sound is what can give audience members the reaction the movie wants them to have PERIOD In one scene involving LaMottas brother slamming someones head with a car door one does not see the person affected by this action PERIOD However with the sound one can clearly picture the possible image in his or her head PERIOD

Ultimately it is the makeup that not only shows the brutal effect of the violence on screen but also traces LaMottas life through the  years used to account his rise and fall PERIOD Regarding its use of violence one can see the effect the punches in the ring have on a boxer PERIOD Westmore explained how he used tubes on De Niros face for the bloody punches PERIOD Even though the film is shot in black and white the showcasing of blood is still effective for the plot of the movie as there is little color contrast as suggested by Westmore at the discussion and brings about a more poetic style to the scenes PERIOD

However the makeup is also used for the most subtle details in the film PERIOD Westmore uses it for smaller moments such as the makeup done to LaMotta to show his roughness and Vickie to show her purity PERIOD He also uses his skills in makeup to create front castons to make De Niro appear older than he is PERIOD Westmore explained that the real LaMottas skull was thicker than most mens PERIOD

At the time the film was released Westmore had tried to bring makeup to the forefront PERIOD Westmore was given a special Oscar for his efforts in this film PERIOD A year after this film was released the Oscars created the Best Makeup and Hairstyling category PERIOD In addition to the screening and QA some of the makeup work and props used for the film were on display such as notes for Sugar Ray Robinson makeup and three prosthetic noses PERIOD

Westmore even explained to the audience that Raging Bull was more of a documentary as there were people involved in the real events who helped inform the cast and crew of what actually happened PERIOD Indeed its no wonder that UCSBs CarseyWolf Center wanted to screen this film additionally inviting Westmore who provided audience members insight into the process of filmmaking through his personal experiences PERIOD
