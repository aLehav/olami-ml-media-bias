UMaines Student Newspaper since  PERIOD

Have you over the course of your studies at the University of Maine ever run into a Board of Trustees member with whom you could chat This was the question Representative Janice Dodge asked of every student who went to Augusta to lobby in support of LD1656 the bill that elected students to represent us on the Board PERIOD

Its a powerful question in the context of that bill but it is also applicable to UMaine in other areas PERIOD How accessible are our campus administrators and leaders Is there a relationship between administration and students at this university While this question is asked specifically of the Board Of Trustees I would like to apply it more broadly PERIOD

President Joan FerriniMundy holds office hours about once per semester PERIOD This gives students staff and faculty the chance to meet oneonone with UMaines president regarding any issue they feel important to bring to her attention PERIOD I for one have made use of these office hours on two occasions PERIOD The most recent time I utilized these office hours I brought up an issue that the president had no awareness of. problems go unsolved on campus because they are unknown to those with the power and authority to fix problems not because administrators dont care PERIOD

Office hours provide the opportunity to raise awareness of issues on campus and communicate the effects of prominent issues to the administrators who hold the power to help alleviate these issues PERIOD While town halls are often seen as an outlet for students and staff to voice their opinions students struggles can be personal and sensitive PERIOD This emphasizes the necessity of private office hours rather than public town halls PERIOD While infrequent the presidents office hours resemble a model for administrators at UMaine to follow PERIOD

Max McDonough is a thirdyear Human Dimensions of Climate Change student who is a frequent attendee at the presidents office hours and an advocate for student issues PERIOD I interviewed him to ask about his experience with the presidents office hours and his opinion on the relationship between the administration and students PERIOD

I have been to office hours for various reasons divestment from fossil fuels problems with the bursars office lack of student representation on the board of trustees issues with the dorm buildings and a few other things said McDonough PERIOD

McDonough is a core organizer for UMaine Climate Action PERIOD The ability to talk directly with administration can help connect entire clubs and movements with answers and accountability PERIOD Issues in dorm buildings are a great example of hidden problems the president may be unfamiliar with PERIOD Its hard to imagine that administrators who dont have to walk half a mile to a dining hall understand the issues with food accessibility on campus or the lack of plowing on weekends PERIOD

I could see everyone from the Provost to the head of facilities hosting office hours PERIOD There have been plenty of questions in regard to student safety this semester PERIOD When I met oneonone with the head of the security council and the chief of police I received incredible answers PERIOD It made me feel safer on campus and it improved my relationship with facilities and the University of Maine Police Department PERIOD

Should certain roles at the university have office hours as a requirement of the job Absolutely PERIOD I do not think it is enough just to be open to meeting with students PERIOD Administrators should have dedicated time for students and their concerns PERIOD Most faculty have dedicated office hours PERIOD It is time that all the administrators at UMaine do as well PERIOD
