Miguel Morfin a recent graduate from the Spears School of Business would have never envisioned that five months after earning his degree he would be helping customers at a local electronics store PERIOD

After graduating he shipped off the officer candidate school where he earned the rank of lieutenant but the military has several processes which cause him to not be officially commissioned until a later date PERIOD

Having already received orders for his next duty station where he will lead  soldiers in the US Army Morfin knows his time at his current job is short PERIOD That hasnt stopped him from having a profound impact on his customers and coworkers PERIOD

During his short time at Best Buy Miguel has come in and not only exceeded expectations but worked hard to set the example for other employees to follow PERIOD

Hes hard working and a good person and a great employee assistant manager RJ Chandler said PERIOD Hes nice and caring and treats it with the same amount of passion as his old jobs in the military and keep the same tenacity and effort and is coachable and wants to learn PERIOD He motivates everybody else to work hard. miguel has shown in past jobs that he has a positive impact on the culture in the workplace PERIOD

Hes a really cool dude said Tyler Houk a former community manager who worked with Miguel at OSU housing PERIOD He got things done and hes definitely a hard worker PERIOD He came in midyear and had a hard time connecting with people initially but he grew on people and everybody liked him PERIOD He actually helped with us being more organized with activities we put on. miguel utilizes the parallels between the military and customer service to his advantage PERIOD

Its actually not too differentI believe the Army gave me all the tools needed to succeed PERIOD The army is really a people business PERIOD They teach you about communication and being accepting and everything I earned leadership wise is so translatable PERIOD When I talk to people I get a real understanding of who they are and what they need and it gives me a leg up on giving them a great experience. miguel takes pride in his military experience and uses it in all aspects of his daily life PERIOD

His management said Miguel has great time management and attention to detail PERIOD

The military also taught me organization and accountability Miguel said PERIOD Its scarier in the army to be held accountable for errors than in the service industry PERIOD If you make an error in the army it could either be millions of dollars or someones life PERIOD That type of pressure makes this job easy. even though his time at Best Buy will be short he still gives it the same effort that he plans to give his new soldiers once he takes command PERIOD
