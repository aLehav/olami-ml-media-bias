A Vintage Film Posters exhibit in the Paul W PERIOD Zuccaire Gallery atthe Staller Center for the Arts complemented the twentieth annual Stony Brook Film Festival last week PERIOD The exhibit will be featured in the gallery until July  and has already welcomed  visitors PERIOD

Typically the Zuccaire Gallery does not host an exhibit in the summer PERIOD However the director of the gallery Karen Levitov saw a unique opportunity that broke theprecedent PERIOD

I thought about doing the show because the Staller Center for the Arts is doing the twentieth anniversary of the Stony Brook Film Festival this year Levitov said PERIOD I thought it would be really fabulous to do vintage film posters in conjunction with the Stony Brook Film Festival. the white walls of the Zuccaire Gallery are currently covered with oldtime movie posters in all sizes and languages PERIOD The posters were all donated from the Chisholm Larsson Gallery in Manhattan PERIOD



Levitov said thatshe found it interesting to learn about the history of film posters as she picked them out for the exhibit PERIOD She explained that film posters started out as advertisements for films but decades later took off as an art form PERIOD These posters were not thought of as works of art until after World War II adding that shift in the perception of movie posters which makes pieces from the 40s and earlier very rare PERIOD This exhibitions oldest poster is a Charlie Chaplin poster from  PERIOD

The reason she decided to get all of the art from one gallery is because the Chisholm Larsson Gallery was very enthusiastic about participating in the projectLevitov said PERIOD

Alan Inkles director of the Staller Center and the Stony Brook Film Festival accompanied Levitov to pick out which posters should be in the exhibition PERIOD

We were looking at ones that had kind of a combination of some really iconic films and some well known actors as well as some more rare films and unknown actors and unknown movies but that had a beautiful visual impact Levitov said PERIOD

Wellknown actors whose faces appear in the exhibit include Audrey Hepburn on a My Fair Lady poster Uma Thurman on the Pulp Fiction poster and Ralph Macchio on a poster for the Italian version of The Outsiders. macchio a frequent attendee of the Stony Brook Film Festival made an appearance at the gallery and took a photo in front of his poster PERIOD

The exhibition also featured a film reel of old Charlie Chaplin filmsplaying on the wall PERIOD Samantha Clink the Gallery and Community Relations Assistant said it was nice to see children come to the exhibit and laugh at the Chaplin films PERIOD

Thats probably my favorite part of the show Clink said PERIOD Youve got these little kids and they are watching Charlie Chaplin which was filmed in  and theyre hysterically laughing PERIOD Its kind of neat to see that old film style now being reborn and watching the kids enjoy it as well. the exhibit garneredpositive buzz from the campus community and those who attended the film festival PERIOD One of the ideas Inkles had was to choose posters from the same countries as the foreign films being shown at the festival PERIOD

A unique aspect ofthe exhibit is that the posters are displayed in a casual style rather than in frames PERIOD The posters are hung on the walls of the gallery by pins in the linen backings PERIOD

It shows kind of the spirit of the posters which was casual advertising at the time Levitov said PERIOD Its presented in a museumlike way here but also in a casual backtoitsorigins kind of way. the traffic from the film festival helped the success of the exhibit as many of the people who came to see the festival which draws in hundreds stopped in the gallery PERIOD

Its been really fun to have it and hear the response Levitov said PERIOD
