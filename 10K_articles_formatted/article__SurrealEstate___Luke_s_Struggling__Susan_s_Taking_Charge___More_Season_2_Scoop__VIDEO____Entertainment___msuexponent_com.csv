Updated November     pm



The Roman Agency is once again open for business but things are different PERIOD

SurrealEstate is back for its second season on Syfy on October  though it almost didnt get one PERIOD The series was canceled in October  before being renewed in May . now Luke Tim Rozon is without his ability to talk to the dead leaving Susan Sarah Levy to step up at the real estate agency as the team of specialists  also including Phil Adam Korson August Maurice Dean Wint and Zooey Savannah Basley  continue to handle the haunted and possessed houses that literally scare wouldbe buyers away PERIOD Watch an exclusive first look above at the new scares with some insight from Rozon and Levy PERIOD

Then read on for Season  scoop from executive producer and director Danishka Esterhazy PERIOD

Talk about finding out SurrealEstate was renewed after the cancellation PERIOD

Danishka Esterhazy We were so happy with Season  and we were really disappointed that we werent going to get renewed for a Season  but we didnt give up and actually always planned to do Season  PERIOD We just figured wed find a way PERIOD George Olson our creator and our showrunner still went and wrote the scripts for Season  and worked out some plans for bringing the show back PERIOD And then while we were trying to find a way for that to happen the fans were out there rallying on our behalf PERIOD And so we went back to network and had a chat and they gave us a Season  which made us so happy because we feel like Syfy is our home and we were really thrilled to get the chance to do Season  PERIOD So it was a journey but a journey that we all did together as a team PERIOD The cast were always completely invested and couldnt wait to go back couldnt wait to put on their real estate agency clothes again PERIOD

Luke is on quite a journey this season PERIOD He doesnt have his abilities so how is he coping with that Who is he as a result

Exactly PERIOD Hes not coping well because I feel like Luke doesnt know who he is without his abilities PERIOD Hes complained about his abilities and hes struggled with his abilities but they really defined who he is and are the reason he forms the Roman Agency PERIOD He has this special ability to talk to the deceased and that allows him to get to the heart of these hauntings and these troubles that these families are having in their home PERIOD So without that he doesnt really know who he is and I think in a way hes suffering through that PERIOD Hes lost his confidence and it really makes him a difficult guy for the rest of the agency to have to deal with while he goes through that journey PERIOD

SYFY

Susan seems to really be taking charge when the season begins because of that PERIOD How does that affect her Because then he comes back and things get a little tense PERIOD

They do get tense because shes been holding the agency together PERIOD Susans a firecracker as well as a firemaker so shes really efficient and shes really driven and shes actually been a great leader PERIOD The agency has been thriving under her leadership PERIOD So when Luke comes back its very fraught its very difficult PERIOD They dont know whos going to be in charge PERIOD Their roles have to change PERIOD Theyre both such strong personalities and that leads to a lot of misunderstanding PERIOD

What does that mean for the rest of the agency kind of stuck in the middle of that

Thats a great comment PERIOD Youre right PERIOD Its like Zooey August and Phil have to choose sides PERIOD Its like theyre going through a divorce and they have to decide which parent they want to live with PERIOD So its tricky because of course everyone in the agency really cares for both Luke and Susan and seeing them have conflict and trying to find a way for them to solve that conflict is one of the things that really motivates the other characters through the season PERIOD

Whats coming up with the search for Lukes mom

It continues but I think thats all I can say PERIOD Laughs

How does that affect him The fact that this is an ongoing search

Luke is really troubled because he lived his life with this absence of his mother and then he finds out these various secrets about his mother and the fact that he had this sister and through it all I think the thing thats been his rock is his ability to speak to his deceased father PERIOD Thats been the main benefit of his special gift that hes been able to continue a relationship after losing his father PERIOD And now with his supernatural abilities gone its like hes orphaned all over again because he cant reach out to his father anymore PERIOD Thats one of the things that also causes him a lot of pain through this season PERIOD

Last season the agency dealt with a demon in the office PERIOD Are there any fun ways the office will be used this season

Yeah that was a really fun bottle episode and I had a great time putting that one together PERIOD No no one gets trapped this time but were also looking for new ways to explore the office and to shoot the office PERIOD We love that location PERIOD We love how it speaks to the various members of the agency and how their work dynamic continues PERIOD So theres fun and games at the office but luckily no lockdown PERIOD

SYFY

Zooey gets her real estate license this season PERIOD

Being the office assistant isnt enough and she wants to be out there and be licensed and be showing homes along with the rest of the team PERIOD Shes kind of leveling up in this season and Zooey goes on a bit of a journey finding ways to express herself and use her talents and grow PERIOD Its really fun to watch PERIOD I love the episodes where Zooey takes her first clients out to see houses because shes such a great character but maybe not a natural fit as a real estate agent PERIOD

Who is she leaning on as shes learning how to actually take this on this new job Is it Luke because they have that history or is it Susan because they got close last season

Yeah they did PERIOD Theyve developed a real bond from beginning with a misunderstanding and maybe not a real fondness for each other when they first met PERIOD Thats changed and developed over the season and I think that bond is stronger this season too PERIOD There really is a mutual support between the two of them thats very genuine and I always love the scenes between Zooey and Susan PERIOD

Does this mean that someone new will be joining to work in the office or is it just a matter of the agency figuring out how everyone can take on different responsibilities

There is a shakeup and there will be a new member joining the Roman Agency PERIOD That is an exciting surprise for everyone in the middle of Season  PERIOD

Hows the adoption going for Phil and Anthony Paul Ewan Wilson

Phil and Anthony are going to be fathers and that is going to be a new stage in their life thats going to bring them a lot of joy PERIOD

What can you preview about Augusts inventions this season What are the most important ones that we should be keeping an eye on

I love Augusts inventions PERIOD Our mad genius who likes to tinker PERIOD He has some really fun inventions he creates this season out of childrens toys PERIOD So those are fun ones to watch and how he takes seemingly benign childrens toys and turn them into powerful dark instruments to speak with the dead PERIOD Laughs

What can you say about whether theres a big bad of the season or if its more just cases of the week

Well always have our ghost listings every episode but there will be one major house that well be following throughout the season PERIOD Season  we had the Donovan house which kept bringing our agents back for more and more adventures PERIOD And in this season itll be Susans new house that becomes the anchor of most of the agencys concerns PERIOD

Whats coming up in their personal lives Lukes romantic life obviously that didnt work out

Yes the season begins and Luke and Megan Tennille Read are taking time out and Megan is moving away maybe not forever but shes not around in this season PERIOD That does open up some romantic opportunities for Luke and some of those cause him a lot of trouble PERIOD But yeah there are new love interests for Luke PERIOD

What about for the other characters

August has some interesting romantic entanglements in Season  that are worth following PERIOD And of course Phil is still happily married PERIOD

SurrealEstate Season  Premiere Wednesday October  109c Syfy
