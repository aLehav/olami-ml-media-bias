3699,2016-11-19,"on Saturday Connecticut fans were left wondering what could have been PERIOD

Like Massachusetts before it Connecticut marched into Alumni Stadium with wild hopes of an upset PERIOD After being passed over for several Power Five conference berths a loss for the Huskies was not an optionConnecticut needed to assert its dominance in New England PERIOD It needed to prove its detractors that elevating others to the bigboy ranks was a mistake that there is a legitimate rivalry unlike Bob Diacos fictionally constructed Civil ConFLiCT PERIOD

Yet Boston College football wouldnt have any of it PERIOD The Eagles are on a mission of their own to return to a bowl game PERIOD And they may have done just barely enough to do it PERIOD

On a day to honor  seniors and more importantly the jersey retirement of legendary BC quarterback Matt Ryan it was the Eagles defense that did their part holding the Huskies to just  total yards PERIOD The muchmaligned BC offense took advantage of constant short fields to pull away from Connecticut in a  final PERIOD The victory is the fifth of the year for the Eagles with only a matchup on the road against Wake Forest remaining PERIOD Head coach Steve Addazio was no stranger to the importance of this win and what his team needed to do PERIOD

Thats the look of a team thats still fighting hard for every inch right now Addazio said PERIOD

In the first quarter the Eagles   Atlantic Coast and Huskies   American Athletic matched one another stepforstep in ineptitude PERIOD Both sides traded short drives that ended in punts PERIOD By the second the Eagles finally got some momentum by switching up their offensive strategy PERIOD Diacos run defense entered the day ranked thirty-fourth in the nation PERIOD But passingwise the Huskies sit at one hundred and nineteenth with  yards allowed per game PERIOD

So the Eagles mixed runs to the edge with passing attempts PERIOD Addazio used Jeff Smith out of the Wildcat package for a couple of long runs with swing routes to Myles Willis and Jonathan Hilliman PERIOD Yet on 4thand3 deep from the UConn 23yard line Addazio took a chance to go for it PERIOD

I see Mike Knolls range and that was messing with his range right there Addazio said PERIOD We had that little feel of confidence in there in Pat throwing the ball. towles returned the favor PERIOD As UConn sent rushers at the tackles to collapse the pocket from the outside in Towles found a seam up the middle for a 16yard gain PERIOD Three players later Davon Jones dove into the end zone for BCs first touchdown of the day PERIOD

Connecticut nearly prevented a fullon momentum swing PERIOD Quarterback Donovan Williams found some soft spots in the BC secondary completing two long passes that put the Huskies in the red zone PERIOD Yet a poor decision by Williams to force a pass to running back Arkeel Newsome gave UConn a 4thand18 PERIOD

His back against the wall Diaco reached into his bag of tricks PERIOD He didnt find anything useful PERIOD

Instead of a field goal attempt Diaco chose to have his kicker attempt a pass PERIOD It nearly landed into the hands of a receiver yet the questionable decision squandered Connecticuts only legitimate chance at a score PERIOD

The Eagles immediately responded with a concoction of Davon Jones runs and short passes to Smith PERIOD Another timeconsuming multiplay drive led to a 35yard field goal by Mike Knoll and a  lead PERIOD

To open the third the offense went back to that same strategy primarily with Michael Walker PERIOD Walker caught all four of his passes for  yards on that drive ending in a leaping touchdown over defensive back Junior Joseph PERIOD It was without question the most efficient and balanced drive of the year for BC in a game in which Towles was better than he has been all yearat least in the eyes of his coach PERIOD

I thought our quarterback played extremely well today Addazio said PERIOD He played his best game at Boston College for sure and that was critically important. following a Mike Knoll 24yard field goal the seniors helped to seal the deal PERIOD Desperate for any offense Diaco forced Williams into an air raid PERIOD That strategy did lead to a touchdown pass just in the opposite direction PERIOD Midway through the fourth quarter Matt Milano picked off Williams easily prancing into the end zone for the score PERIOD For him it was a special moment to clinch it on Senior Day PERIOD

That was my first interception and it was great Milano said PERIOD It was a great feeling and to return it for a touchdown was just icing on the cake. to the surprise of many across the nation BC faces a rejuvenated reality PERIOD The  season has been unsatisfying for many BC diehards PERIOD After last years  ACCwinless debacle Addazio had one starting goal get back to six wins get back to a bowl PERIOD It seemed unlikely for much of the year PERIOD The team was blown out  by four of the ACCs elites PERIOD It had two victories snatched away by poor play and a 4thand19 PERIOD It has caused uproar among fans both students with angry signs in windows in  St.Thomas More Rd PERIOD or Vanderslice to alumni angrily protesting on Twitter PERIOD

But like it or not the Eagles have done their part to achieve it PERIOD They dominated their nonconference schedule one which was touted as the easiest in the country with a  record PERIOD They stole an ACC win against North Carolina State on the road PERIOD

That might just be enough to clinch a postseason berth PERIOD The Eagles will have a chance to get to six wins in WinstonSalem N.C. next week against Wake Forest in a rematch of last years  debacle PERIOD Even if the Eagles dont hit that mark they may have a chance to make it at  PERIOD The tiebreaker Academic progress rate PERIOD BC is one of the topfive teams in the country in that category PERIOD Either way Addazio and the Eagles are prepared to accept the challenge regardless of the frustrations of this year PERIOD

This has been a year that we havent been able to build any momentum or confidence its just the way its fallen and its on me Addazio said PERIOD Now were able to get back and get a little momentum and a little confidence  and play Wake Forest to have a chance to get our sixth win. so despite the discontent directed at this programmuch of it justifiedthe Eagles have almost completed the slow inch toward their goal bowl eligibility PERIOD And after a season like this Saturdays win will make BC fans wonder what soon canand willbe PERIOD
