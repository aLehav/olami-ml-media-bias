Because sex in the 90s is so complex and risky the choices people make are vitally important for their own livelihood.Choices a Womens Health Project helps women who are at risk of contracting HIV and STD infections learn how to make safer choices about their sexual health.Choices is different from other sexual education classes.It does not preach but helps women make choices about their sexuality helps them set realistic goals and helps put these goals into action.In a smallgroup setting Choices offers women  or older the opportunity to receive  weeks of free indepth safer sex counseling and education.So women from all over the city can participate in the program Choices offers free food transportation to and from each session and licensed free child care PERIOD said Blair Beadnell coprincipal investigator of the project PERIOD We try to look more broadly at sexual health by giving women a variety of choices  from female and male condoms to abstinence to mutual monogamy.Project AriesIf you come in as a newcomer theyre less likely to give you funds PERIOD If you have a history there and they know who you are and how you work theyre more likely to fund your program.Choices is offered only to women because we have data from earlier research and people change partners a lotIn a way it would be great to work with couples PERIOD But because of the number of partners involved you cant work with all of them.The participants in the study are not just from the UW.Choices attracts its women from public health clinics community clinics community colleges surrounding universities technical schools social service agencies and ads in local papers as well as notices placed in other public places such as laundries and grocery stores PERIOD The women who participate range from students professionals and women on welfare to women from the sex industry PERIOD Beadnell stressed that participation by minorities is a very important part of the program PERIOD The directors of each session are also of different ethnicities PERIOD To begin the program Choices acquired a group of professionals from social service agencies clinics and educational institutions that would make up a community advisory board PERIOD The board was involved in finding the people who direct each session mainly therapists or health educators PERIOD According to Beadnell when entering the program each woman has a full STD exam and HIV test at the Harborview Medical Clinic PERIOD Sixty percent of the women entering the program have been tested before and have had an STD sometime in their past.Beadnell believes the women who are in the program are not naive about the threat of STDs and AIDS PERIOD Instead they believe they might be at risk PERIOD They may be monogamous but suspect their partner may be having sex with other people.Knox said the whole program is to Beadnell added Beadnell thinks an important aspect of the program is the  Kevin Harris who works full time for the People of Color Against Aids Network is also one of the cofacilitators in the program PERIOD As a health educator he guides the group members to learn from each other and asks them how they would handle certain situations PERIOD Harris said PERIOD After the 16week session is over Choices has four eight and  month followups to check the womens progress and to see if theyre making changes PERIOD The data hasnt been looked at yet because the project has just begun its third year but Beadnell is hopeful the project has yielded changes PERIOD New Choices groups will start monthly until December  PERIOD By the end of the study Choices hopes to reach  women.Knox added that the whole program is essentially a map PERIOD Choices gives the skills and its up to the woman to put them to use.For more information about the Choices program call  PERIOD
