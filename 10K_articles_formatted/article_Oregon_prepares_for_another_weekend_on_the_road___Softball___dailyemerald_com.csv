This weekend the Ducks are heading to Las Vegas Nevada for the Alexis Park Resort Classic where they will take on Drake Saint Marys Florida Atlantic Southern Utah and New Mexico State PERIOD

The Ducks are  this season but in the Mary Nutter Classic Oregon finished  with its only loss of the weekend to Nebraska PERIOD The Ducks fell one run short to the Cornhuskers in their first game of the tournament last Friday PERIOD But Oregon bounced back in the following days with wins over the No PERIOD  and No PERIOD  ranked teams PERIOD

This weekend the Ducks are looking to make a cleansweep at the Alexis Park Classic taking on unranked teams and possibly trying out their newest pitcher PERIOD

Last weekend freshman pitcher Megan Kleist helped Oregon take home a  win over Oklahoma State with a complete game two hitter PERIOD She also recorded five strikeouts for the Ducks while the righthander stepped in for Oregons usual pitcher Cheridan Hawkins PERIOD

Oregon has shown stellar defense through its first three tournaments of the season including just one game before when Hawkinsthrew  strikeouts against Missouri to earn Oregon the 87victory PERIOD

The Ducks will need that defensive power for their first game of the weekend against Drake PERIOD Last week the Bulldogs took home a  win scoring six runs in the sixth inning alone to take down Arkansas PERIOD

But Oregons biggest competition of the weekend will be against Florida Atlantic PERIOD The Owls are  this season with their only loss last weekend against Maryland PERIOD
