6155,2023-11-04,"a free and responsible press serving the UMass community since 

The Environmental Protection Agency announced last month that the University of MassachusettsAmherst had been found to be in violation of the Clean Air Act PERIOD

As of Oct PERIOD  the EPA had proposed fines against UMass for four violations totaling  PERIOD

The fines are negotiable and the University is currently involved with the EPA to determine whether it should ultimately be paid according to both the UMass News Office and EPA sources PERIOD

According to a press release put out by the EPA the University did not have a properly operating vapor recovery and control system at its gas station thus allowing smogcausing chemicals into the air did not keep records of gasoline storage tank maintenance malfunctions and repairs did not keep adequate records of its degreasing operations and used automobile paints with excess levels of smog forming solvents PERIOD

These violations resulted in an excess of volatile organic compounds the main component of smog being released into the air the release stated PERIOD

The EPA first introduced newer tougher environmental codes for colleges and universities in March  the release explained PERIOD Since then the EPA has made an all out effort to help UMass meet its environmental responsibility according to a statement included in the press release by Robert W PERIOD Varney Regional Administrator of the EPAs New England Office PERIOD

Since the violations were found the EPA has stepped up these efforts according to EPA official Tom Olivier who has worked closely with the University during the inspection process PERIOD Olivier said that the proposed fines are a last resort in this situation PERIOD He also said he sympathized with the problems that the UMass administration encounters as it manages a large facility PERIOD

The violations are all easy to correct he said PERIOD However its a challenge for an institution like UMass which essentially runs a mediumsize town PERIOD Its a challenge for any big organization. location may also play a part in the violations on campus PERIOD Olivier said that to the best of his knowledge no other University of Massachusetts campus was found to be in violation of air codes but explained that this may be because the other campuses in the UMass system are located in the eastern part of the state PERIOD

Western Massachusetts as a region is regularly at nonattaining levels of air quality he said PERIOD

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University had also been cited for EPA violations he said but their violations concerned the storage of hazardous materials in labs PERIOD No other college campus in the western part of the state other than UMass had been cited PERIOD In fact he remarked the problem at UMass Amherst has been unusual in that it focused on the Clean Air Act. still Olivier said he was optimistic about the current negotiation process PERIOD

This will be a process to try to come to an agreement on applicable fines and what UMass will need to do to come into compliance and stay in compliance he said PERIOD But my sense is that UMass is trying to learn about its environmental responsibilities. representing the University according to Olivier are Vice Chancellor Paul Page InHouse Counsel Brian Burke Environmental Health and Safety head Don Robinson and a few representatives from the Physical Plant PERIOD An unnamed attorney from the Boston area is representing them PERIOD

The members of this group as well as Rules Committee Chair Ernest May Provost John Cunningham Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Javier Cevallos Interim Chancellor Marcelette Williams Chair of Environmental Health and Safety Department Salvatore DiNardi Manager for the Campus Hazardous Waste Department James Fox and Head of University Communications Robert Connolly were unavailable for comment as negotiations got under way PERIOD The list of UMass representatives given by Olivier could not be confirmed by University sources PERIOD

According to News Office representative Barbara Pitoniak the University is avoiding making statements about the violations to either the local or regional press as negotiations continue PERIOD

Our response to the press has been limited she said but only by the fact that the matter is being taken up by UMass officials and the EPA and neither party is interested in doing so in the press. however she assured the Collegian that there will be some sort of resolution at some point which we will probably announce. olivier mentioned that UMass could defer the fines by participating in supplemental environmental projects in addition to coming into compliance with the basic codes PERIOD Olivier said that he didnt know if UMass would take that option PERIOD

On Oct PERIOD  the University announced that it had been selected for an EPA Pilot Program concerning the disposal of hazardous waste PERIOD Though the EPA will fund the program it remains unclear whether this is the type of supplemental project that Olivier specified PERIOD

The program could result in less hazardous waste greater energy conservation wider use of environmentally safe materials and improved management of solid waste among other potential environmental health benefits PERIOD UMass is one of only five New England schools selected for the program according to the Oct PERIOD  press release PERIOD

Chancellor Williams was quoted in the release as saying This campus has a long history of environmental stewardship PERIOD I view this program as another step that is consistent with our mission. however the University seems to have remained reserved about its commitment to the environment PERIOD Junior Psychology major Jamie Lavin said that she was shocked to hear of the violations PERIOD

Thats really scary she said PERIOD The fact that its being hidden from students that we didnt know about it is a little unsettling. as for Williams statement in the UMass press release Lavin commented that is also extremely unsettling and I hope that theres some truth in what she says PERIOD Shes got students to protect PERIOD Not just herself. junior English major Clare Chadbourne who is here for the year on exchange from the University of Leeds in England said that her view of UMass had changed upon being told of the violations PERIOD

This has an impact on the way I view the University now she said PERIOD Its obviously not prioritizing environmental issues PERIOD I thought it was a committed and liberal university that stood up for ethical values but now I see that it still bows to the pressures of American commercialism PERIOD Id have no hesitation about telling people at home about that. chadbourne said that she hoped that students would speak out about the issue soon PERIOD I hope students take notice and react against this. cancel reply
