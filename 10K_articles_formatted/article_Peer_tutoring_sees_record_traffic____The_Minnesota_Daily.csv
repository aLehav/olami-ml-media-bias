Peer tutoring in the SMART learning commons at the University of Minnesotas library system has never been so busy PERIOD

If current trends hold fall  could be the most trafficked semester based on numbers dating back to  for the free learning resource PERIOD

Since Sept PERIOD  tutors in Wilson Walter and Magrath libraries have already seen more visits than fall spring and summer of the  academic year combined PERIOD

Brett Gray individual learning services coordinator with SMART learning commons oversees the peer tutoring program and started his position on Jan PERIOD  with hopes to make sure students were aware of the campus resource PERIOD

Without a single factor to pin down the spike in traffic this semester Gray attributes the visits to increased outreach education tweaking of program services and talented tutors PERIOD

Sometimes the professors make it extremely difficult to bring it down  to a student level understanding said tutor Noah DeSutter who has been with the program since fall  PERIOD I think as tutors we kind of bridge that gap. sMART hires  to  paid undergraduates each semester who maintain a GPA of . or higher PERIOD The  tutors on staff this year tutor for classes in which they received an A PERIOD Altogether the tutors support more than  different classes PERIOD

Brett Peterson a chemical engineering junior and Elsa Hauschildt a mechanical engineering junior said they both feel that peer tutors can explain subject matter in a more approachable way than TAs or professors PERIOD

Some professors understand it too well and they cant dumb it down Hauschildt said PERIOD

Peterson and Hauschildt used peer tutoring help with Physics I when they were freshmen PERIOD

I just felt like peer tutors had a better understanding about answering questions that we were given because they can explain it on a level that we can understand Peterson said PERIOD

Forty percent of students who come for tutoring are secondsemester freshmen or firstsemester sophomores Gray said PERIOD

I started pretty behind on math so being able to come here and talk about calculus or  advanced math was really helpful said Joe Carlyon undeclared sophomore and recent transfer student PERIOD

More than  percent of tutoring services are devoted to Calculus I the tutoring programs most requested course PERIOD

I dont have a lot of resources otherwise Carlyon said PERIOD The U is really good about letting you know about these things. holly Williams a senior in accounting and information management systems has been a tutor for math economics and writing for two and a half years PERIOD Williams said she notices many students return for tutoring PERIOD

Its great when people come to you and they are really unsure of their material and then they walk away feeling like they learned something Williams said PERIOD

Students can schedule oneonone appointments with tutors in Magrath and Walter libraries a new aspect of the program this fall that many think contributes to its increased traffic PERIOD

This fall also marked the first time students could book oneonone evening appointments between  and  p.m PERIOD in Walter an initiative in part supported by the Office of Undergraduate Education PERIOD

So far this semester the latenight sessions are usually booked two weeks in advance Gray said PERIOD

Despite the spike in traffic many said they feel like there is a stigma surrounding tutoring on campus and nationwide PERIOD

Gray said he has been long aware of the stigma about tutoring PERIOD

Were conditioned when its okay to ask for help in certain areas but when it comes to mental health when it comes to academic success for some reason were not willing to do that Gray said PERIOD

He added he hopes barriers that keep students from entering the tutoring commons continue to break PERIOD

I love it when you see someone come in and theyre absolutely terrified because they have an exam DeSutter said PERIOD When they finally get that aha moment from understanding something its really nice to be able to help them reach that point. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
