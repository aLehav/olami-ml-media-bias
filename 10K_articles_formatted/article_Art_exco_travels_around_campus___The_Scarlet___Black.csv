From a Victorianstyle suitcase with tea and cookies to a mathematicallyinspired suitcase representing the interaction between work and vectors the wide variety of the art showcased by the Suitcase Art Experimental College ExCo truly emulated Grinnells liberal arts mission PERIOD
The students of the ExCo displayed their final products in Faulconer Gallery this Thursday PERIOD The leader of the ExCo is art major Christopher Squier  who is also the web editor at the SB PERIOD
Squier got the idea after seeing Yayoi Kusamas sculpture in Des Moines and the suitcase art of Yin Xiuzhen online PERIOD In one of her pieces Yin portrays startling skylines she became known for her representation of New York with two ghostly twin towers shortly after Sept PERIOD  . squier found that his ExCo helped students develop their artistic skills but also found it to be a great community building activity PERIOD
One of the good things about this was also it helped me meet new people in art here at Grinnell that are second or first years or that did art or were English majors and just werent here very much so I thought that was really a good aspect of it Squier said PERIOD

Squier made his own suitcase art a naturethemed suitcase with unraveling pink extensions resembling entrails draped over the back of a sofa PERIOD When closing the suitcase exhibition all Squier had to do was roll the entrails back into the suitcase and close it up PERIOD This feature sets suitcase art apart from other art forms PERIOD
The most exciting thing about this ExCo or this art in general is that it is portable we can take it with us Squier said PERIOD Someone can take it and show it to their friend or we could meet up in the future theoretically and have another show PERIOD People can take these home with them and keep working on them if they want to. suitcase art is not just a practical method of displaying art it also contains deep symbolism PERIOD
I always have thought boxes are cool because they open and close and stuffs hidden in them Suitcases are pretty as an object they have a lot of symbolism that you can put into them Squier said PERIOD They just have a lot of relation to the self and the body and what do you choose to carry with you how does it represent your home and things like that PERIOD What would you put in it if this was all you had to take with you
After their exhibition in Faulconer the suitcases were formally presented at Faulconers This I Believe OpenMic event PERIOD The suitcases then traveled to Spencer Grill and Younker
Lounge PERIOD
