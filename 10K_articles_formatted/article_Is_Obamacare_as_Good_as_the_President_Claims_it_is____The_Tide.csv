Yes The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act commonly known as the Affordable Care Act ACA or Obamacare as Republicans have nicknamed it will provide healthcare to the  percent or estimated  million Americans who are currently uninsured PERIOD

This is a good thing PERIOD Obamacare works to provide quality affordable healthcare through individual mandates PERIOD This means Americans without insurance will need to attain coverage through an employer or provider and those who are covered remain with the same carrier PERIOD Previously individuals were declined insurance due to pre existing conditions such as pregnancy accidental injuries high blood pressure and more PERIOD Under the ACA insurance companies are banned from denying healthcare to anyone PERIOD Obamacare is beneficial for students as well allowing them to be covered by their parents insurance until the age of  PERIOD With this said Obamacare is a beneficial law that shows social and political progression for America PERIOD

However some individuals feel otherwise like Travis Ray a senior History major who believes The government should revise Obamacare. ray continues It has many parts that harm the people and are not well thought out ideas. although he did not specify which parts he considers detrimental there is something about Obamacare that definitely needs improvement PERIOD

Though the actual law is a great change for American healthcare providing insurance to millions of Americans the ability to obtain coverage has proven problematic PERIOD The Healthcare.gov website launched on Oct PERIOD  for consumers to shop and purchase health insurance PERIOD Unfortunately it presented a number of technical issues that negatively affected the consumer experience PERIOD Individuals are having trouble logging onto the website and browsing insurance plans and encountering error messages and site timeouts PERIOD

Some states including New York have opted for a state exchange the decision to implement an online price comparison specifically for the state compared to a national insurance marketplace PERIOD

The state exchange has proven to be more efficient than the national exchange PERIOD According to The New York Times the New York exchange announced more than  eligible people have signed up for healthcare PERIOD The faulty website is one very disappointing feature of Obamacare and bad representation of the health reform law itself PERIOD

Alternatives to the Healthcare.gov website have been provided to help Americans sign up for Obamacare with less frustration PERIOD Oneof these is through the U.S PERIOD Postal Service PERIOD A paper application can
be downloaded from CMS.gov Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and mailed in to start the healthcare buying process PERIOD If waiting for the application to be received is less frustrating than waiting for the webpage to be repaired this may be a better option PERIOD

According the Huffington Post the healthcare reform law has established workers to assist consumers through the process of applying for insurance PERIOD Contact information can be found on the Find Local Help page of the Healthcare.gov website which is unaffected by technicalproblems PERIOD Private vendors offer similar insurance through online marketplaces allowing consumers to shop and compare plans as well PERIOD

Americans are encouraged to use these alternatives if they are frustrated with the website PERIOD Applicants have until Dec PERIOD  to choose a plan that takes effect on New Years Day PERIOD

Johanna Wills a senior Art Therapy major recognizes the websites issues but appreciates the ACA It is disappointing that the website isnt up to par but Obamacare is great for America PERIOD Everyone else has universal healthcare PERIOD Its about time we caught up. understandably it is hard to separate the malfunctions of
the Healthcare.gov website from the actual policies of the Affordable Care Act but this should not discourage students from healthcare PERIOD Obamacarefacts.com is a great website providing everything one needs to know about the new changes to our healthcare system PERIOD Students can also utilize the Find Local Help feature on the Healthcare.gov website to receive unbiased advice and information on the best healthcare options PERIOD
