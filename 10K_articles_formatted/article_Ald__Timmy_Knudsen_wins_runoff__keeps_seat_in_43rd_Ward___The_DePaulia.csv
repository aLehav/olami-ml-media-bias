forty-third Ward alderman Timmy Knudsen smiles to a crowd of supporters after securing victory over Brian Comer in Tuesday nights runoff election PERIOD

Receiving more votes than any candidate in a forty-third Ward aldermanic election in Chicago history Ald PERIOD Timmy Knudsen defeated Brian Comer to keep his seat in a tightly contested race Tuesday night PERIOD

We left everything on the table and look where we landed Knudsen said to a crowd of supporters and family in Lincoln Park PERIOD

With  of precincts reporting nearly  ballots were cast in favor of the Knudsen giving him a more than  vote advantage of Comer PERIOD

Knudsen and Comer topped a field of six candidates on Feb PERIOD  but neither received the more than  threshold required to avoid a runoff PERIOD

In the final push ahead of Tuesdays election Knudsen collected significant endorsements from both Illinois U.S PERIOD Senators Democrats Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth PERIOD

At Knudsens victory party Tuesday night were two of his former opponents in the first round of the election Wendi Taylor Nations and Rebecca Janowitz PERIOD In his victory speech he thanked both for their support along with other members of his coalition PERIOD

Throughout this campaign we shared a positive and detailed message of improving public safety stabilizing city finances and advancing fundamental rights Knudsen said PERIOD Over the next four years I cannot wait to advance this progressive agenda. like most other Chicago municipal races public safety dominated the forty-third Ward race PERIOD Though the ward is home to some of the wealthiest residents in Chicago still crime was at the forefront of messaging from each candidate PERIOD

Weeks before the election controversy struck Knudsens opponent PERIOD Comer who is the current president of the Sheffield Neighborhood Association spread false information following an incident involving police in Lincoln Park on March  PERIOD The now aldermanic runner up posted a video to Facebook in which he incorrectly stated a CPD officer had been shot PERIOD The video was removed weeks later PERIOD

At his victory event Tuesday night supporters of Knudsen pointed to his work combatting ward crime in his relatively short stint thus far as alderman PERIOD

Although hes held the seat since September Tuesday night was Knudsens first victory in any election PERIOD The current youngest member of Chicago city council was appointed to the position by Mayor Lori Lightfoot following former alderperson Michele Smiths abrupt retirement PERIOD

I vow that I will continue our work Knudsen said PERIOD Representing our ward with respect with stability and leading the rest of the city as the forty-third Ward has always done. city News
