In the spirit of change the yearbook has been renamed The Summit. with alterations to the Mascot and athletics name the yearbook decided it was time for a new style as well PERIOD

In an effort to bring individuality to their organization members decided to name the yearbook something other than a reflection of the schools mascot which was originally titled The Brave. we wanted to come up with a name that both reflected the Quinnipiac community and what the yearbook staff attempted to achieve through our yearly project and publication said Lauren OLeary editor in chief PERIOD

Many names were conjured up from the staff and then an ad was placed in the newspaper asking for community suggestions PERIOD  A sign hung in the cafe for people to write suggestions and the yearbook approached SGA and other organizations for suggestions PERIOD The finalists were Synergy The Q The Echo The Laureate Horizons The Clock tower In Focus Exposure and Mercury PERIOD

The yearbook came up with a list of final four and voted leading to the new name The Summit PERIOD

The Summit was a suggestion that randomly and at the last minute came out at the final decision meeting said OLeary PERIOD  We were just going down the list of names we had come up with and deciding whether or not to make them a final option PERIOD The Summit was a name suggested and immediately well received. oLeary said the meaning behind the name was basically to insinuate that the Quinnipiac community is comprised of only the best those who reach the summit. moreover it reflected the monumental effort that the members of the yearbook staff put into the making of the book in order to reach the summit of quality said OLeary PERIOD
