Theater maybe more than any other art form is a team effort PERIOD For a production to work it takes the combined efforts of the director cast costumer stage designer and the sound and light crew PERIOD

Even the best performances tend to have some holes PERIOD But when everything comes together like it does in the Jeune Lunes production of Molieres The Miser its a sight to behold PERIOD

Molieres play which debuted in France in  centers on a day in the life of Harpagon Steven Epp a rich old codger so set on not spending his money that his house looks more like a crumbling heap of plaster than a home PERIOD Harpagon and his children and servants are dressed in tattered white rags looking something like extras from Wes Cravens The People under the Stairs. harpagon is intent on marrying the young Mariane Maggie Chestovich PERIOD He is determined to go through with the wedding even though their age difference makes him nervous and even worse her poor family brings no dowry PERIOD

But Harpagons son Cleante Stephen Cartmell is in love with Mariane and she with him PERIOD Not one to be sentimental Harpagon is determined to wed his son to a rich old widow who will bring money to the family PERIOD

Meanwhile Harpagons steward Valere Jim Lichtscheidl has been carrying on a secret love affair with Harpagons daughter Elise Sarah Agnew PERIOD

Valere makes a living disingenuously agreeing with everything Harpagon says  chiming in with lines like Spending money is the root of all evil  and is at a loss for words when he finds out his master is intent on marrying Elise off to the wealthy old man Anselme Steven P PERIOD Peterson that evening PERIOD

As if all that werent enough Harpagon spends the whole day worrying that somebody is going to steal the case full of gold he has buried in his backyard garden PERIOD The treasure concerns him so much that he is unable to sleep and becomes more of a paranoid delusional mess as the play progresses PERIOD

The action culminates in a final evening scene improbable as it is satisfying PERIOD

The unlikely ending works because the humor of the play is so outstanding PERIOD While it deals with heavyweight themes of love family and greed the play is riotously funny PERIOD

At times it resembles the infamous Benny Hill Show chase scene with actors running in and out and all around the crumbling scenery PERIOD The dialogue is a bit like the late great Arrested Development two or more characters repeatedly carry on conversations where each one thinks the other is talking about something else entirely with only the audience aware of whats really going on PERIOD

Of course considering the age of the text its probably more correct to say the two aforementioned shows resemble The Miser. jeune Lune shows just enough restraint in its attempts at updating the centuriesold work PERIOD Many of the costumes resemble a hodgepodge of the old and new with a few of the more questionable characters dressed like the Men in Black PERIOD At one point when Harpagons plump chef Jacques Richard Iglewski tells his master how the public makes fun of him behind his back he proclaims that they no longer tell jokes about drunks falling down in the gutter or vice presidents shooting people. the cast is brilliant across the board PERIOD Epps performance in the title role is particularly sharp though Lichtscheidl and Iglewski steal a few scenes PERIOD Epps screeching voice and grotesque movements consistently draw laughs from the crowd even as they make sure Harpagon is nothing short of

unlikable PERIOD

All of the actors have a certain gymnastic quality  contorting their bodies performing exaggerated movements across the stage jumping up and off the walls running around doors and sliding across the floor PERIOD Cleantes servant La Flche Nathan Keepers spends a good portion of one scene going through a series of hand stands as he

delivers his lines which is an interesting if confusing

sight PERIOD

The look of the play bolsters the outstanding performances PERIOD The allwhite set is bracketed by windows on both sides PERIOD As the play progresses the light shining through the windows moves almost undetected from east to west as morning becomes night with the color always reflecting the mood on stage PERIOD

Theres really nothing to nitpick PERIOD The Miser is a classic text given a superb treatment by a crew thats been putting on the play for several years around the country and has an instinctive grasp of the material by this point PERIOD Theater rarely comes together so well PERIOD
