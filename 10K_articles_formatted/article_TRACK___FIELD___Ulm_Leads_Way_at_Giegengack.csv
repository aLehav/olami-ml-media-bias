While the Georgetown mens track team competed in dozens of events across two states this past weekend five Hoyas in particular stood out in the  meters at Yales Giegengack Invitational PERIOD The solid performance showcased a range of athletes on the Blue and Gray middle distance squad PERIOD

The Hoyas were led by an unfamiliar face in the event PERIOD Redshirt junior Toby Ulm who usually competes in the 400m and 500m during the indoor season rode the coattails of freshman Billy Ledders pacing through the first 550m then burst ahead to take the lead for good PERIOD He went on to win the event with a time of . pERIOD

Hes a gamer Director of Mens and Womens Track and Field Patrick Henner said PERIOD I dont care if you put him in a marathon hes going to give it a great effort. ulms athleticism and competitiveness gives him the range to compete in multiple events in both the indoor and outdoor seasons PERIOD

Our primary goal for him is to run a great 400m hurdles by the end of the year PERIOD  The 800m is a tool for that Henner said PERIOD

Ulms 800m time was the 17thbest in the NCAA this season and showed he is capable of competing on the national level PERIOD He will run his second 800m of the season this weekend at Indiana University with hopes of hitting an NCAA qualifying time PERIOD

Ulms was not the only noteworthy contribution Oftenoverlooked sophomore Brian Hencke finished fifth in the event with a solid time of . pERIOD

I think hes a good example of what our program is all about Henner said PERIOD We knew he was talented all along but he wasnt a bigname recruit PERIOD I think hes made just a huge step up from where he was last year. henckes improved workouts and attitude have turned him into one of the better middledistance runners for the Hoyas PERIOD His work ethic has translated into considerable success these past few meets as he set personal records in the 1000m run at the Penn State National Invitational and in the 800m last weekend PERIOD

Hes starting to race with a lot more relaxation and confidence PERIOD He really listens to corrections PERIOD Thats the kind of person we need to rely on Henner said PERIOD

On the other hand junior Theon OConnor turned in a disappointing performance in the event finishing ninth with a time of . pERIOD

I think Theon was just a little too aggressive early Henner said PERIOD He also has to learn to keep his composure and not fall apart a little bit better. unlike Hencke OConnor was a highly touted recruit but he has yet to reach his full potential this season PERIOD Although it hasnt shown in the results OConnor has put together one of his best stretches of training working hard with Ulm week in and week out PERIOD

I think Theons in the best shape hes ever been in PERIOD He just now has to find the right combination of relaxation and aggressiveness Henner said PERIOD

While OConnors season has gotten off to a slow start Henner and the coaching staff have maintained their patience with the middle distance talent PERIOD

His performance is not a huge concern because he wants to run well Henner said PERIOD From my experience as a coach someone who wants to run well will end up running well. senior John Maloy and graduate student Dan Leyh finished in the top  of the event as well PERIOD Maloy placed sixth with a time of . while Leyh finished tenth with a time of . pERIOD

Both runners are hardworking veterans whose commitment to the program is oftentimes not captured by the results PERIOD Maloy has been a key part of many Georgetown 4x800m and distance medley relays in the past his personal record of . is the 12thbest indoor 800m in school history PERIOD

Leyh has made contributions in both the 800m and 1000m in the past for the Hoyas including a seventhplace finish in the 1000m at the  Big East indoor championships PERIOD

Other Notes

Senior Chris Kinney continued his methodical march toward the NCAA automatic qualifying time in the 60m hurdles breaking his own school record for the second weekend in a row with a time of . seconds in the finals of the event PERIOD Kinneys time was good for third place behind Texas sophomore Keiron Stewarts .68s  the best ran in the NCAA to date  and USC junior Oscar Spurlocks .71s PERIOD Junior Biyerem Okengwu also had his best race of the season in the event finishing ninth with a time of .13s PERIOD

The womens DMR team of junior Lauren Borduin senior Deidra Sanders freshman Chelsea Cox and sophomore Rachel Schneider ran a solid  to finish eighth in a competitive field PERIOD Borduin came through the 1200m in  Sanders ran a 55s 400m leg Cox ran a superb  on her first 800m and Schneider brought it home for the Hoyas with a  on the anchor mile PERIOD Currently sitting eleventh on the NCAA indoor list the time might not be enough to secure a trip to nationals PERIOD Look for the Hoyas to try to run another fast DMR later in the season to move up the allimportant list PERIOD

Schneider and Borduin returned on day two of the meet and competed well in the mile with Schneider taking third in  and Borduin taking seventh in  PERIOD Both times were indoor PRs in the open mile for the duo PERIOD Schneiders time is the fifth best in the Big East this season PERIOD

Junior London Finley had an encouraging weekend running well in all three of her events PERIOD Finley showed signs that she has returned to form after a slow start to the season leading off the 4x400m relay with a 55s split and running a solid .58s in the open 400m PERIOD The Hoya sprinter and hurdler also looked good in the 60m hurdles running a time of .55s to finish first in her section PERIOD

The mens distance crew had a good showing in the mile at Yale PERIOD While the  pacing through the 800m mark was a little too fast for the Hoyas at this point in the season senior Ayalew Taye finished with a . to win the event PERIOD Redshirt freshmen Dylan Sorensen and Bobby Peavey finished second and fifth respectively with times of  and  PERIOD Billy Ledder turned in a . narrowly edging out Peavey for the fourthplace spot PERIOD
