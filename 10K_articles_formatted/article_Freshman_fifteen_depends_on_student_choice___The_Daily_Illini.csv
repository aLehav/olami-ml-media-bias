Before even stepping foot on campus freshmen are warned about the dangers of the dreaded freshman fifteen. a widespread concern across the nationis that university freshmen gain  pounds by the end of their first year of college PERIOD However a  study conducted by the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford revealed that this is no longer the case PERIOD

The study was conducted on six electronic databases using data from  to  PERIOD The study concluded that the overall average weight gain of the  students surveyed was  pounds over approximately five months PERIOD

Jacob Singleton

During their freshman year .9percent of students gained weight PERIOD Of that percentage students gained an average of .5pounds PERIOD



Even though thisis about half of the expected amount freshman weight gain is still an issue PERIOD

At the University firstyear and transfer students are required to live in residence halls PERIOD While students have the option of choosing between private certified or university housing a meal plan is part of the requirement PERIOD

With University housing students can eat in BuseyEvans FAR Ikenberry Commons ISR LAR and PAR PERIOD Students in private certified housing such as Bromley Newman Illini Tower or Presbyhave more dining restrictions PERIOD

Restaurants on Green Street and offcampus are an option as well but they come with an outofpocket cost PERIOD

Leila El Erian freshman in FAA works and eats in the Ikenberry Commons PERIOD

El Erian said many of her freshman friends create their own meals in the IKE because premade meals are often unhealthy PERIOD

I dont know anyone that eats healthy and eats in the IKE said El Erian PERIOD Look at the  menu there is nothing healthy on that PERIOD Theres chicken tenders theres buffalo wings and stuff but I dont see anything healthy on there. north serves hamburgers hot dogs fried chicken sandwiches fish sandwiches chicken wings chicken tenders pizza jumbo pretzels fries onion rings and mozzarella sticks PERIOD

It does also serve the healthier option of a spinach wrap butEl Erian said although she thinks the spinach wrap is a better option it becomes unhealthy when students add ingredients such as sour cream to it PERIOD

Katlyn Carrington freshman in DGS and Snyder resident said it seems like there is only fried food available in the IKE PERIOD

El Erian said she stopped eating in the IKE and switched her meal plan to credits only because she didnt like the foods served daily such as pork and macaroni and cheese PERIOD

In Illini Tower Dining Services Manager Holly LaPrade said the staff tries to balance everything out PERIOD She said they often get requests for healthier food so the staff will prepare more options that are grilled baked or sauted instead of fried or battered PERIOD

However just because healthier options are offered it doesnt mean that students eat them PERIOD

In a healthier meal everybody goes and gets cheeseburgers and Philly cheesesteaks at the grill section PERIOD If we have chicken strips or chicken wings theyre gone in a second said LaPrade PERIOD They tell themselves they want healthier and they do probably want healthier but its not what theyre actually eating. there are fried foods available at every meal but its up to the diner to make the better choice PERIOD

Ill be honest when I started working here I gained quite a bit of weight pretty quickbecause it was all right there whenever I wanted LaPrade said PERIOD

Since then LaPrade said she learned to make healthier choices and select combinations of food that are better PERIOD

Students who dine in Illini Tower tend to eat the premade options over putting together their own meal PERIOD

LaPrade and her team try to be proactive in helping the students create meals but the problem is that students dont pay attention to signage PERIOD

LaPrade said there are healthier options available to freshman but it is up to them to select those choices PERIOD

I think that a lot of it is just other things on their mind and something thats ready prepared right in front of them is going to be easier than if they have to do little work to put the meals together LaPrade said PERIOD
