4114,2019-05-23,"two years after the  Isla Vista tragedy the Beloved Community Project embarked on a mission to unite the hands of Isla Vista and pick up the pieces of the community working to make sure no one had to go about it alone the groups cochair Diana Collins Puente said PERIOD

Equity inclusion and activism are the three central pillars of the project according to Collins Puente who serves as the Associated Students A.S. and I.V PERIOD community advisor connecting the two spaces PERIOD

The organization held a Beloved Community Common Table on Saturday with the hope of bringing together the community PERIOD Ida Kazerani  Daily Nexus

The project was inspired by an adaptation of Dr PERIOD Martin Luther King Jr.s three pillars of discrimination militarization and consumers she added PERIOD

But these three pillars according to the other cochair of the Beloved Community Project and former External Vice President of Local Affairs EVPLA Jeike Meijer are not limited to the Beloved Community Project  they represent community as a whole PERIOD

To Meijer community is a connection of people. in kindergarten you see those globes with little people holding hands  thats what I always think about when I think about community as cheesy as it sounds. since its inception Collins Puente said the Beloved Community Projects organizing committee made up of  students and staff members has helped sponsor and organize a variety of community outreach and healing events in I.V PERIOD

As the second anniversary of the Isla Vista tragedy neared Collins Puente said the A.S PERIOD body at the time sought to honor and commemorate the lives lost while also fostering conversations that would allow the community to heal from the tragedy in a positive manner PERIOD

In  the Beloved Community Project began working toward that goal by hosting a twoday conference in I.V PERIOD with the hope to bridge all parts of the community Collins Puente said PERIOD

She said the conference  which took place in six different locations in I.V PERIOD  was a major stepping stone in the Beloved Community Projects development and was sponsored and funded by over  different local organizations including I.V PERIOD Youth Projects St PERIOD George Family Youth Center I.V PERIOD Food Coop and I.V PERIOD Recreation and Parks District PERIOD

During one segment of the conference titled I.V PERIOD Talks Collins Puente said elders in the community houseless members of the community and youth of the community all spoke to their experiences in I.V PERIOD while working toward a common goal. meijer said her most memorable experience with the Beloved Community Project took place during Fall Quarter  when Meijer  in collaboration with the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the Beloved Community  went doortodoor in I.V PERIOD and distributed the tote bags as a way to introduce people to their neighbors and Isla Vista. among other goods each tote bag contained an Isla Vista guide with letters written by local middle school students PERIOD The letters asked that college students acknowledge the middle school students in the community and addressed how to take care of this community for everybody Meijer said PERIOD

However Collins Puente finds that taking care of the community does not always involve an event of its own PERIOD She said the porous nature of the project allows it to foster change in other forms as well PERIOD

If were feeling like were making a connection with a person that feels much closer to their own idea of community then that is actually the product we want at the end of it  Our process is our product Collins Puente said about the core philosophy of the project PERIOD

She added that she draws from that philosophy for motivation to maintain the project and foster new initiatives PERIOD

Being a part of the Beloved Community Project is simple Collins Puente noted  when living in I.V. there is no membership PERIOD You are already part of Beloved Community. print
