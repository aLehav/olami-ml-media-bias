Updated November     pm



I recently had a psychological assessment done PERIOD

This was on the advice of my defense attorney who informed me that the insanity defense may be my best option at this point that might be more than you wanted to know but just FYI If you ever have me over for a meal hide the potato peeler PERIOD

No no Im lying of course PERIOD I didnt use the potato peeler PERIOD

Anyway I found this assessment fascinating PERIOD Psychiatrists are very different from other types of doctors in that they dont wash their hands before examining you PERIOD They seem like very nice people PERIOD

Most of the time the doctor just asked me boring questions  how was I doing in school was I abused as a child had I ever beaned an old lady with a frozen carp  while I sat and wondered where this was all going PERIOD I thought maybe Iowa PERIOD

But I was wrong PERIOD

Because when we were done the doctor wasnt ready to pronounce me insane yet PERIOD Not until I had answered more questions thereby demonstrating my inability to realize that I had already been asked every question in the universe PERIOD

In fact the doctor wasnt ready to pronounce me anything yet PERIOD Thats the thing about psychiatry PERIOD Its very subtle PERIOD When I go to see my regular physician hell ask me a few things and then come up with a definitive medical conclusion  I feel like I can respond to this PERIOD 

But with mental health nothing is certain PERIOD Is it schizophrenia or major depression And more importantly which nostril Answers to these questions require hours of careful consideration during which youre not allowed to sneeze PERIOD Like I said very subtle PERIOD

I actually thought about being a psychiatrist for a time PERIOD Until I realized I would need to go to medical school and be subjected to many terrible things like work PERIOD Looking back Im glad I opted out PERIOD Because if I hadnt I might be sitting across from a patient just like me someday PERIOD Then I would have to hide the potato peeler PERIOD

In any case I returned for the second phase of the assessment a week later PERIOD I usually dont mind waiting rooms because I always end up trying to figure out what everyone around me is suffering from PERIOD But at the psychiatrists office I found this extremely hard to do because I was the only one there PERIOD

Maybe it was also because I have bipolar disorder PERIOD Thats what the doctor concluded after asking me how I felt PERIOD I said I was feeling very bipolar PERIOD When I asked why I was feeling bipolar the doctor responded 

I should start feeling very creative right about now PERIOD That is apparently what bipolar individuals do  be creative PERIOD Like Ernest Hemingway who was named after me and who expressed his literary genius by writing books that people like to pretend they have read PERIOD Like that one book he wrote PERIOD Man was that good PERIOD

Another thing bipolar people have are periods of mania or hypomania when we become energized and feel up to any task PERIOD So please join me next week when my column will be  pages long and written in Gaelic PERIOD
