While finishing up work last Monday I was dismayed to read the University of Minnesotas latest response to the recent increase in crime on campus PERIOD

University Services Vice President Pam Wheelock sent students staff and faculty a public safety update similar to those that University police Chief Greg Hestness sends out PERIOD In it she stated she will be providing regular updates to the University community PERIOD However if last Mondays email is any indication of what those reports will be like I fervently hope she doesnt PERIOD

In her email Wheelock wrote that in too many instances the actions of students give criminals the advantage they need. now this is a pretty callous thing to say about any crime victim but consider that Wheelock sent this email less than a day after the University community received an alert about a University student who was sexually assaulted by a man posing as a police officer PERIOD

I tried to get on with finishing my work but as a rape survivor myself Wheelocks words left me shaken PERIOD I ultimately wound up leaving for the day without completing my work PERIOD

In hopes of lifting my spirits I decided I would go for a quick swim at the gym before heading home PERIOD However as I approached the intersection in front of the gym I realized a trio of female students was animatedly talking about the recent assault PERIOD Their conversation consisted of selfrighteously shrieking about how stupid somebody would have to be to fall for a police impersonator  and blah blah blah we all know the drill PERIOD I hurriedly crossed the street to get away from their smug superiority conference although I could still hear them from the other side of the street PERIOD

What University administrators and students like that trio seem unable to comprehend is that violence is a public health issue and victim blaming enables it PERIOD Rapists often get away with rape because the jury determines the victims actions were partly to blame PERIOD Research has shown that rapists plan their attacks to take advantage of societys prejudices against rape victims and certain groups of people PERIOD Therefore the homeless transgender women sex workers and others are disproportionately targeted PERIOD What will happen if the man who impersonated a police officer is caught and tried but the jury has absorbed ideas such as Wheelocks and decides to give him a lighter sentence or let him off because you know the student was also to blame This is a regular occurrence in courtrooms nationwide PERIOD The University needs to think before disseminating crime alerts that include victim blaming PERIOD

Rape survivors and other survivors of violence often dont report the crime because they are afraid of the attitude found in Wheelocks email PERIOD I didnt report my rape for precisely that reason PERIOD

According to the Rape Abuse  Incest National Network  percent of sexual assaults are not reported and  percent of rapists will never spend a day in jail PERIOD This doesnt even begin to scratch the surface of how victim blaming will affect a survivors life when they hear other victims being blamed PERIOD For me it opens old wounds up all over again PERIOD I would imagine survivors of all types of violence at the University are having a difficult time in their classes or at work as they listen to administrators and students callously depersonalize and judge their experience PERIOD The University can disseminate safety tips without Wheelocks unnecessary editorializing PERIOD The University should be offering counseling and support to all students whove recently been robbed raped or otherwise assaulted  not blaming them PERIOD

I understand that the University wants to make students aware of how to staysafe but Hestness emails already give safety tips and every student is likely already aware that walking alone at night isnt an ideal situation PERIOD However there are many reasons people walk alone at night and in some cases a student may have simply decided that walking alone is safer or better than the alternatives PERIOD

The fact is that staying out late or working late is a huge part of college life and students shouldnt be required to isolate themselves from normal college experiences PERIOD If this is what the University expects it should be prepared for students to choose other universities where they can engage in normal behavior without being shamed PERIOD
