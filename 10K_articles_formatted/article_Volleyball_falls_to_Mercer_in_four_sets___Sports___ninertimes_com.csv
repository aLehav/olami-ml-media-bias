Mercer jumped out to a hot start against the 49ers scoring the first five points of the game with ease PERIOD After that the 49ers used a spike from Kaylyn Torain and an ace from senior libero Shelby Greene to fight their way back into the game 3to5 PERIOD

While down 12to15 both teams volleyed for an insanely long rally giving the big crowd the exciting volleyball they came to watch PERIOD The 49ers used that momentum during the strenuous point and also backtoback blocks by Molly Shaw to claw their way back within one 16to17 PERIOD

Mercer pulled away to a 17to22 lead but the 49ers used a kill by Shaw a block by Katria Stewart and a sideout to pull within three 20to23 PERIOD

With the win just two points away Mercer had two errors to help the 49ers back into the game now only down by one PERIOD Unfortunately for the Niners the Bears finished off the first set off an error from Stewart to capture the first game 22to25 PERIOD

The 49ers scored the first two points of the second set to try and avoid digging themselves in a hole like they did in set one using that momentum to jump out to a 5to2 lead PERIOD

After even play from both sides Shaw pounded home a spike to tie the game up at  after multiple blocks from the Charlotte frontline and a couple tough digs for senior Green PERIOD Charlotte took the lead after a spike by Stewart to go up 16to14 trying to pull away from the fighting Bears PERIOD

An ace serve from Shaw helped the 49ers keep the momentum and go up by three 18to15 attempting to tie up the series at one PERIOD

Charlotte used a skillful tip and spike from Janell Sparks to get their lead up to 21to18 eyeing their first set victory of the match PERIOD

The 49ers took set two with a kill from freshman outside hitter Shaw to send them into set three knotted up at one set a piece PERIOD

Mercer hopped in front of the 49ers 3to5 to begin the third set looking to avoid getting swept in the first day of play at the Charlotte Invitational PERIOD

The Bears scooted ahead of the Niners by four but a spike by Henderson Sparks and great team passing brought the fans of Halton Arena a tie game at seven PERIOD

The Niners tied up the game at eleven a piece when Green somehow dug out a ball that seemed impossible to find PERIOD Over the next few plays the Bears went on a  run leading 12to15 going into a Charlotte timeout PERIOD

Mercer built a seven point lead 15to22 leading to a Niner timeout to attempt and stop the momentum PERIOD The attempted momentum killer didnt work as planned for the 49ers losing the third set 16to25 PERIOD

Going into the fourth set down by one set the 49ers got out to a hot start with a couple kills from Sparks and Anna Henderson leading 3to1 PERIOD

A block by Henderson widened the 49ers lead to 7to4 forcing a mercer timeout PERIOD Morgan Barker had two straight acrobatic digs on the backline to send ewwws and ahhhs throughout Halton Arena PERIOD Just a couple points later Barker had a couple more incredible saves to give the 49ers a 11to7 lead PERIOD

After trading points the 49ers and Bears were all tied up at  in the fourth set with Charlotte needing to win the game to send it to a decisive fifth set PERIOD After a timeout by Charlotte the 49ers went on to score two straight points to tie it at  PERIOD
