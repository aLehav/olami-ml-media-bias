5029,2023-11-04,"what does being a landgrant university really mean

by  Editorial boardPublished  October  

Next year will mark the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the passage of the first Morrill LandGrant Act which established public universities across the United States PERIOD It is easy to throw this history around rhetorically but what does it really mean to be a landgrant university in 

In brief landgrant colleges were founded in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes. of course when we talk about founding principles it is dangerous to slip into an orthodox originalism PERIOD

Most students at the University of Minnesota do not need to be taught military tactics  one of the goals of the original Morrill Act PERIOD We must always recognize that what was right in our founding context will not necessarily be right in the present and above all we must allow for the possibility to improve and adapt PERIOD

Reexamining our raison dtre can provide a crucial clarity in times of transition like these PERIOD When we invoke the landgrant heritage we recall a time when Americans had limited access to higher education and when knowledge was considerably less democratic than it is on Wikipedia PERIOD

Landgrant universities were also a revolutionary recognition of higher education as an accessible public good  one that the government should provide PERIOD This idea linked practical and classical knowledge rural and urban agriculture and public wellbeing PERIOD It was the antithesis of ivory tower academia PERIOD

Surely the University must innovate and adapt in the decade ahead or risk losing its significance PERIOD Still in a recent appearance on Minnesota Public Radio President Bob Bruininks cited the extraordinary responsibility they entail PERIOD We agree that looking ahead the landgrant ideal is still worth aspiring to PERIOD
