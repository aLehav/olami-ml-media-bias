Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Brooklynn HarperJanuary  

DeKalb will add another pizza place to the community as Rosatis Pizzeria  Pappas Drive pushes closer to its opening date PERIOD Read more about their opening here PERIOD

 PERIOD The crust

The crust similar to a bowl or pan holds everything inside its high walls PERIOD The dough is worked and baked all the way up the side of the deep pan PERIOD This unique style dough offers a buttery crunch with every bite PERIOD

 PERIOD The toppings

The abundance of crust allows for more toppings than a pan or thin crust pizza PERIOD Chicagostyle pizza toppings get stuffed inside the bowl of dough compared to thin crusts sprinkling of toppings PERIOD Rosatis Pizzeria provides a fullyloaded option with their Rosatis Monster PERIOD This pizza comes packed with sausage pepperoni bacon ground beef mushrooms onions green peppers and green and black olives PERIOD

 PERIOD The preparation

While most pizza styles are assembled with the sauce in between the cheese and the crust Chicagostyle pizza flips the script PERIOD Chicagostyle pizza slathers the pizza sauce on top of the cheese PERIOD This formula of sauce on top saves the cheese from burning as the crust takes much longer to cook than a thin crust pizza PERIOD
