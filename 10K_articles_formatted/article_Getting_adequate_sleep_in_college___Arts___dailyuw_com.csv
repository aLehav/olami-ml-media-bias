Six hours would be good PERIOD Seven would be nice PERIOD Eight would be tough to do but would feel amazing PERIOD Nine hours or more Now thats just a pipe dream PERIOD

The National Institutes of Health recommends eight to  hours of sleep per night which may seem like an unattainable goal PERIOD Being a fulltime student on top of time devoted to RSOs parttime jobs and other extracurriculars getting enough sleep may be the first thing to go despite most students knowing that it is detrimental to their health PERIOD

When students ask for help about getting more sleep campus medical professionals suggest focusing on improving sleep quality rather than quantity PERIOD

There is certainly variability across students and any one persons experience has unique contributing factors said Dr PERIOD Bill Neighbor chief of clinical services at Hall Health PERIOD Keeping a sleep diary is something we ask of patients because when people are more conscious about how much sleep they are getting the more equipped they are to figuring out the problem. in addition to wakeup and bedtimes there are common things students can look at for improvements to their sleep cycles such as limiting caffeine and alcohol consumption or making sure that unintentional stimulants such as exercise and meals do not happen too close to bedtime PERIOD Evaluating how conducive their bedroom environment is to sleep and separating the stress of homework and studying from relaxing are important steps that can raise quality of sleep PERIOD

Certainly late adolescents are ones whose sleep can be easily disrupted because their schedules are so busy said Dr PERIOD Michele Meola a psychologist at the UW Counseling Center PERIOD They may want to stay up at night maybe studying for a final or hanging out with friends PERIOD More erratic sleep schedules just make them more vulnerable to those disruptions. meola added that the nature of student schedules  having an early morning first class one day but a later start the next  are also at fault PERIOD It makes students believe they can stay up later and sleep in more on some days without any sort of negative effect PERIOD This serves only to add to the irregularity of their sleep PERIOD

Other common strategies like afternoon naps and sleep marathons on weekends are not always helpful because one cannot make up for lost sleep during the week PERIOD Another common solution students choose is sleep medication but this should be done judiciously PERIOD

Anything that involves medication without first consulting with a medical provider could be missing some underlying factors contributing to sleep difficulties said Jason Kilmer associate professor of psychiatry PERIOD Additionally we know some use substances like alcohol or marijuana to speed up the onset of sleep PERIOD While people might fall asleep more rapidly they experience deprivation of REM Rapid Eye Movement sleep which could result in increases in anxiety and sleepiness the following day. another suggestion is giving oneself about an hour to wind down without the distraction of screens since playing a game or watching a show to wind down can create distractions due to the light intensity of the device PERIOD

With a range of potential contributors Neighbor suggests addressing sleep troubles with a nonmedical approach PERIOD

Its a more natural process Neighbor said PERIOD It is much better to make lasting changes that help out with the rest of your life during times when you have difficulties sleeping and in making adjustments to your schedule. medical professionals should primarily be consulted when adjusting ones general habits is unsuccessful PERIOD This means that the disrupted sleep could result from some other underlying factor such as sleeping condition PERIOD

If youre trying to do something differently approach each night like an experiment Kilmer said PERIOD If you had a good nights sleep great PERIOD If you didnt what could you try differently the next night that might result in a different outcome
