Every morning I let the light from my computer screen thaw my face while I message my friends who are worlds away PERIOD Its as if we all live in a tiny village that is illuminated by the light of a computer PERIOD

Online friendships should not be diminished by the fact that these people are not physically present in your life PERIOD In a world where it is possible to connect to anyone around the globe they foster unique connections and memories PERIOD

I didnt want to be confined by the confines of my room or the small town I grew up in so I learned more about the people who were outside of it PERIOD

I ventured into the online world when I was  PERIOD At the time I had just started high school PERIOD I was a shy girl who wore graphic Tshirts that were loud enough to speak for me PERIOD

I met one of my first online friends on an artist social networking site called DeviantArt PERIOD

She lived in Germany and was also shy PERIOD She was embodied in my life as a pale green chat box filled with happy emojis and a little personal picture that was the size of my thumb but she was so much more PERIOD

We talked to each other constantly about our days at school crushes and anime characters PERIOD We even started our own online fan club based on our favorite anime character which eventually garnered  members PERIOD

She taught me how to say good morning and goodbye in German PERIOD She was always there for me during the beginning of my high school career PERIOD Even though she was never physically in my life I have fond memories of her as if she was PERIOD

I am not the only person who has received some sort of emotional support from people on the internet PERIOD In fact a study done by Pew Research Center in  found that internet users and Facebook users received more social support  not just online but from all their relationships combined. i met many other online friends throughout the years who showed me how special online friendships can be PERIOD My friendships with these people have not been emotionally dissimilar from any other friendship Ive had in real life PERIOD I fought with them apologized to them laughed with them and cried with them PERIOD

My friends and I had come to know each other well enough that we could tell when we were upset or happy just by the words we used PERIOD We knew the language of the internet and how to break the barriers of not speaking in person which helped to maintain our friendships PERIOD

Despite this I realize that some people still consider online friendships to be unrealistic PERIOD An article from The Guardian regarding online friends stated researchers believe that facetoface contact is nearly always necessary to form truly close friendships. what this article fails to address is the growing importance of the internet in our lives PERIOD Pew Research Center found in  that about a quarter of U.S PERIOD adults say that they are online daily PERIOD The highest percentage of those who said they are online daily were between the ages of  and  PERIOD

Human beings are by nature sociable creatures PERIOD The way we socialize with one another will inevitably change as technology advances PERIOD This change will not deprive people of their natural social needs it will enhance them PERIOD

I am proof of this change PERIOD My online friends are real because the memories and experiences I have had with them are a part of my human experience in the constantlyevolving world we live in PERIOD Instead of a picture book I have a computer that tells the story of my friendships PERIOD

I have lived in an online village with my friends PERIOD Its lit by the light from a computer screen but in reality we all live under the same sky PERIOD
