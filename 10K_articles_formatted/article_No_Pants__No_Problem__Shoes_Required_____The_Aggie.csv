Wearing anything from booty shorts to buttless cheetah thongs jock straps to jockey shorts more than  UC Davis students sprinted across town in their skivvies on Friday night celebrating the third annual UC Davis Undie Run PERIOD

The event was organized by Mike Veliz a junior studio art major who decided his first year that UCD should be part of a growing college tradition already embraced by schools such as San Diego State University UC Santa Barbara UC Los Angeles and the University of Texas PERIOD

A friend and I just decided to organize it and its been a pretty big success Veliz said PERIOD This is the biggest one weve had so far. at  p.m. students began gathering around the flagpole at the Memorial Union and by  were ready and fired up to begin the run PERIOD As soon as the sprint began students held onto their bouncing undergarments and charged past Hickey Gym across Hutchison Field through Central Park and down B Street to eventually make a full circle back to the Quad PERIOD

After a brief hiatus to cheer on the lagging undie walkers and a quick display of school spirit with loud football game cheers shouts of to the library ushered the crowd to its final stretch a romp through the normally silent 24hour reading room PERIOD

I got stuck behind the guys in man thongs said Ty Canning senior psychology major PERIOD But it was a lot of fun  if I was wearing clothes I would have definitely have felt out of place. text and photo by MICHELLE IMMEL
