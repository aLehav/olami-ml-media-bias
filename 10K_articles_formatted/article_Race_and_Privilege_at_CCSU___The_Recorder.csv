CCSU Hosts Connecticut Supreme Court Hearings at Davidson Hall

by Ruth Bruno
Momentum from the Black Lives Matter movement which started last semester is picking up again on campus as students and teachers collaborate to host discussions about race privilege and the criminal justice system PERIOD
Last year the campus was a hotspot for protests and rallies following the verdict of Darren Wilson in relation to the Ferguson incident PERIOD
As time has moved on some members of Central Connecticut are hoping to keep the momentum and continue discussions about race PERIOD People wait for some sort of traumatic event or outrage to happen but the fact is those things are happening every single day said Joshua Perlstein a fulltime theatre professor at CCSU PERIOD
Students from the CHANGE Carrying Humanity As New Generations Emerge coalition and the BSU Black Student Union have joined with Perlstein to advocate for changes in society and the criminal justice system beginning with a talk hosted yesterday night PERIOD
Decriminalizing marijuana is a huge issue said Mercedes Mckelvie who serves as secretary of the BSU PERIOD
Many times young men of color are arrested for possession and convicted of this crime PERIOD When they are out of jail they are now convicts and unable to vote and find a job PERIOD This in turn causes a cycle of injustice continued Mckelvie PERIOD
If we spent as much money on education as we do on prisons everybody would be in school PERIOD If we didnt devote so much of our resources to criminalizing and incarcerating people when they dont need to be maybe we wouldnt have these problems said Perlstein PERIOD
Perlstein who has worked with children placed in the CADY juvenile training school in Middletown uses theatre as a way to encourage and educate young minds PERIOD
We did a quick workshop and they were remarkable not only their willingness to engage but their transformation in attitude and outlook for the future said Perlstein of the CADY students PERIOD
He hopes he can bring these same lessons from theatre future meetings debates and events to influence the way students think about their futures PERIOD
I believe our criminal justice system is telling people of color that they are x and this is their story and this is their destiny PERIOD If we can retell that story then well have a whole new generation of very creative and successful people said Perlstein PERIOD
Despite his work Perlstein emphasizes that he is not the one who started the momentum on campus PERIOD I in no way claim to be a leader to this PERIOD Im just responding to what I perceived was already on campus PERIOD The first moment would have been the reaction to the Ferguson verdict last fall said Perlstein PERIOD
He was then approached by student Anthony Valentine a senior who was one of the founding leaders of the CHANGE coalition on campus PERIOD Before I leave I want to feel like Ive created a community here said Valentine about his work with the coalition PERIOD
They invited me to take part in some of the events that were happening around campus said Perlstein I was disappointed to find that more faculty werent involved PERIOD
Perlstein is teaming up with students to host several events which will be announced throughout the semester the first of these was a meeting last night which aimed to involve more students in the conversation of race and privilege PERIOD
If we really believe in the roots of democracy just because Im not part of the group that seems to be affected doesnt mean I dont have a responsibility to engage in a discussion said Perlstein highlighting the purpose of the meeting PERIOD We have an obligation to have open honest thorough and respectful conversations. the Recorder
