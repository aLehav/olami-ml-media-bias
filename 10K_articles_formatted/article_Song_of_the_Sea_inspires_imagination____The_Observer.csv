John Darr  Monday March  

The Secret of Kells an absolutely gorgeous film from upandcoming Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon is yet to receive the following it deserves in the United States PERIOD

Kells Tomm Moores directorial debut is a shining triumph of form and function in film PERIOD At the heart of the film is the Book of Kells PERIOD The beautifully illustrated and ancient Irish Gospelserves as the inspiration for both the artistic style and plot of the film as the tale of a young animator is told in a world that mirrors the beautiful paintings he strives to create PERIOD The films wellcrafted cast of nuanced characters its seamless incorporation of the fantastically mythological and its consistently breathtaking illustrations make a clear case for instant classic status PERIOD

This past weekend Tomm Moores second film Song of the Sea was shown at DPACs Browning Cinema PERIOD Song of the Sea also delves into Irish mythology for inspiration PERIOD At the heart of the plot is the Celtic myth of the Selkie a being which can switch between human and seal forms PERIOD Using the mythological world as an anchor Song of the Sea takes a remarkably unflinching look at loss fear and wounded relationships for a childrens movie PERIOD Thankfully the youthful energy of the film and vibrant animation prevents Song of the Sea from ever seeming like a slog PERIOD The films central characters a single father with a son and daughter provide a realistic portrait of a family struggling with the loss of one of its members PERIOD

Its clear from the first minute of the film that Song of the Sea preserves the breathtaking animation style and quality of its predecessor PERIOD The film utilizes flat object shapes that echo the twodimensionality of older artwork yet incorporates immaculate shading and colorbased textures that bring each scene to life PERIOD Each shot exudes attention to detail framing the characters against their backdrops in ways that mirror the nature of each setting  the geometrical maze of the city the twisted sprawl of the country path or the towering lookout of the lighthouse PERIOD

In addition the film does a fantastic job of capturing childrens imaginative perspective of the world around them PERIOD It often utilizes perspective shot from the central characters rather low angle to accentuate the youthful grandeur of the films universe PERIOD In addition the mythological figures in the film are alternately granted glowing colorful sheens and watercolorwishywashyness allowing the viewer to grasp the vivid yet fleeting nature of the imagined PERIOD The end product is a film that makes its adult viewers feel young again and its young viewers believe in magic PERIOD

As suggested before however the films themes and emotional intensity seem a bit mature for its audience PERIOD The father of the children at the center of Song of the Sea is made emotionally distant by the loss of his wife PERIOD Theson blames his sister for the loss of his mother who passed in childbirth and the film shows the family struggle to recover from the trauma PERIOD The mythological world interacts seamlessly with the real one as fantasy serves as an allegory for the more material events in the narrative PERIOD Though the fantasy element is used to capture the more complex emotional hardships the characters endure Song of the Sea still packs a punch straight to the heart PERIOD Dont forget to bring some tissues PERIOD

Ultimately Song of the Sea is a beautifully animated film whose intended age group fails to limit its artistic quality and thematic content PERIOD Its a mustsee for any fan of animated film or cinema in general PERIOD With another brilliant and unique title under his belt director Tomm Moore has continued making a case for himself as the next great storyteller in animated film PERIOD
