A solid victory over longtime rival University of Delaware on Oct PERIOD  gave the Pride a great deal of momentum going into its showdown against Towson University on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

The Pride hosted the Tigers and defeated them  PERIOD  However this score was not telling of how well the Pride played as it outshot Towson  on the day PERIOD

With the win the Pride increases its winning streak to three and has now won seven of its last eight games PERIOD

The first  minutes of the first half brought the Pride its first and only goal PERIOD  Junior midfielder Chrissy Arnone put on a clinic as she dribbled through four defenders and hammered a lowerright corner ball into the net PERIOD

Arnone received the ball about  yards out off the foot of senior midfielder Emma Kilduff and made a cut around one defender toward the middle of the field PERIOD  She then split two defenders and took on a fourth for a foot race to the goal PERIOD

It was Arnones fourth goal of the season and Kilduffs fourth assist of the season PERIOD

The remainder of the first half was spent in Towsons defensive zone with the Pride tallying  shots by halftime PERIOD

Thanks to allstar play by Towson goalie Brandi Daniels the Prides many challenges were stifled PERIOD  Daniels made five saves in the half and came up with some spectacular stops including two off of Kilduff PERIOD

Unfortunately for Towson it only got two shots off in the first half both off of headers in front of the net PERIOD

Despite a scare at the  minute mark for the Pride which involved a header from Towsons Jaime Swears that missed just wide off of a corner kick the second half was fairly quiet for both teams PERIOD

Each team only registered two shots and senior goalie Becky Wachsberger needed to make only one save on the day PERIOD  With this victory Wachsberger recorded her fourth shutout of the season and the twenty-third of her three year career as the starter for the Pride PERIOD

This victory boosts the Prides Colonial Athletic Association record to  and its overall season record to  PERIOD

At home the Pride has lost only one game this season  and the team hopes to keep it that way when it plays its final two home games on Friday Oct PERIOD  and Sunday Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Friday will bring George Mason University to the Prides turf and Sunday the Pride will face off against James Madison University PERIOD  Until then the team is on a  day hiatus PERIOD
