2787,2012-10-23,"tuesday the Memorial Unions Great Hall filled with University of Wisconsin employees who debated the Human Resources Design Projects recommendations PERIOD

A panel made up of graduate students professors Wisconsin University members the HRDP team and American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees prepared fiveminute speeches issues regarding the future for academic staff PERIOD

Barb Peters a member of AFSCME  said she was concerned with seniority noting staff who have worked longer may not have health insurance when they started but new workers now receive it PERIOD

It is great that people starting out now are getting insurance but we also need something for the people that didnt have insurance when they started and have been working here supporting the university for years Peters said PERIOD

She also expressed concern employees who are just starting their employment make the same amount of money as those who have been at UW for years PERIOD

Linda Michaels a state employee for  years and Wisconsin Professional Employees Council member said she agreed with Peters giving an example of an employee she is training who has no experience yet makes  an hour more than she does PERIOD

UW education professor Noah Feinstein said the HRDP changes are a positive opportunity but may also prove to be a risky move PERIOD He said the faculty should show that their concerns such as those for more money reflect the shared values of the UW community PERIOD He noted changes should benefit the UWs success as a whole PERIOD

This is not a choice between the hard reality of the market and squishy values Feinstein said PERIOD Taking the market road also represents a value position. bob Lavigna UW director of human resources was the last on the panel to speak and he outlined the HDRPs development from July  to today PERIOD He said the plans were a great opportunity but also a great challenge of balancing many different interests. he added the HRDP recommendations that will be made to the state lawmakers were created through reaching out to the campus community as a whole PERIOD He also praised the UW employees for making the university successful PERIOD

At the end of the day we all understand that the reason this is a worldrenowned university is because of the quality of people that work here Lavigna said PERIOD
