4125,2002-04-12,"a local legislator is seeking to provide victims of genderbased violence with new means to seek redress in conjunction with Sexual Assault Awareness Month PERIOD

The Violence Against Women Act introduced by Assemblymember HannahBeth Jackson passed the state assemblys Judiciary Committee April  and moved to the floor of the state assembly PERIOD The bill would better enable victims of sexual assault and domestic violence to bring civil suits against their assailants by establishing genderbased violence as a class of criminal behavior and extending the statute of limitations for civil claims PERIOD

The bill was based on a similar provision of the federal Violence Against Women Act which was overturned by the Supreme Court PERIOD According to Jackson the court ruled  that the authority to enact this provision was in the hands of the states PERIOD

This is based on the federal act which was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support PERIOD They felt that the federal government was exceeding authority and jurisdiction shouldnt be a blanket decision it should come from each state she said PERIOD

Beth McGovern the legislative director for the California National Organization of Women said while sexual assault and domestic violence victims can currently file civil claims against their attackers the new bill would provide additional help by increasing statute of limitations to  years after the crime is committed PERIOD

McGovern said the burden of proof in criminal court usually falls heavily on the victim who due to the trauma associated with the crime may take many months before taking action and often lacks the evidence necessary to successfully prosecute PERIOD

Generally speaking it is a little bit easier to prove these kind of cases in civil court she said PERIOD There are situations where the available evidence will not be sufficient in a criminal prosecution but in a civil case will be enough to be successful. by extending the statute of limitations the bill would also enable more victims to obtain compensation Jackson said PERIOD

Were talking about the right to sue in federal court and to get compensation for financial and psychological damages she said PERIOD Most students are not able to pay those damages but the bill expands the opportunity for victims to sue and collect damages PERIOD The thought is that within a few years after college the perpetrators have established themselves financially and the victim can collect appropriate retribution. by grouping together genderbased crimes Jackson said the bill also helps counteract the epidemic of violence against women PERIOD

On the theory that perpetrators of genderbased violence have multiple victims if we can intensify criminal prosecution and identify perpetrators civilly hopefully we will be able to discourage these behaviors Jackson said PERIOD Violence against women is at epidemic levels in our society and this law sends a clear message that violence against women is a serious criminal offense and will be taken seriously PERIOD

Carol Mosely the Rape Prevention Education Program coordinator at UCSBs Womens Center said the bill brings the necessary attention to the prevalent community problem of sexual violence against women PERIOD

There are between  sexual assaults in this community every year so this is not an isolated event PERIOD It is important to realize that the best way to address a problem as big as sexual assault is by attempting to remedy the problem from a variety of perspectives she said PERIOD This offers an option PERIOD The more options a person has the better  I hope this will work to serve as a deterrent. anyone interested in more information can contact the Rape Prevention Education Program located in the Womens Center at  or call the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Centers 24hour hotline at  PERIOD Both are free and confidential and open to men and women and friends and family of survivors PERIOD
