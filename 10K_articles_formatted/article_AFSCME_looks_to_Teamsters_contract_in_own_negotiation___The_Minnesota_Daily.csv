by  Angela GrayPublished  November  

For its final proposal the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees union dropped all noneconomic issues and are demanding a replication of the Teamsters contract settlement PERIOD

The University Teamsters settled for a . percent wage increase and retroactive pay back to July  a  percent wage increase for  a  percent wage increase for  and a signing bonus said Erik Jensen Teamsters Local  steward in the housing department and a bargaining committee member PERIOD

Jensen said no union wants to accept anything less than what another union receives PERIOD

If the Teamsters were in the same predicament as the AFSCME union members you bet wed ask for the same if not more he said PERIOD

Sue Mauren secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local  said most of the members were happy with the Teamsters settlement PERIOD

The majority of our negotiating committee felt comfortable recommending the contract terms to the Teamster union members she said PERIOD

But David Skeie Teamster Local  member called the Teamsters settlement a huge setback PERIOD

The contract might look good on paper but when the health care premiums and past internal political setbacks are added its a very different picture Skeie said PERIOD

He said that despite their lessthanperfect contract he understands why AFSCME union members are fighting for the same terms PERIOD

Negotiations have been dragged on for so long he said PERIOD It wont be pleasant fall picketing  it will be snowy icy subzero temperatures picketing. he said the longer AFSCME union members try to negotiate with the University the more it will hurt the union PERIOD

Strategically the AFSCME union members should have grinded things to a halt shutting down campus during orientation and the first week of school he said PERIOD And more importantly costing good money from the University for every hour the strike continued. skeie said AFSCME union members invited Teamsters delegates and members to stand as a united front in the beginning of the negotiations PERIOD

The Teamsters leadership was reluctant to join forces and never ended up working together he said PERIOD They wanted nothing to do with AFSCME. mauren said the Teamsters wanted to focus on resolving their own union issues themselves PERIOD

Throughout the negotiating process most of the unions still communicate and support each other to some degree she said PERIOD

Skeie said there are different types of negotiating styles unions use and some work while others dont PERIOD

AFSCME Local  President Phyllis Walker uses good oldfashion confrontation and very forward approaches to negotiating and the Teamsters might have wanted to use a different approach Skeie said PERIOD

Jensen said the Teamsters should have worked closely with AFSCME union members PERIOD

Strategically unions that work together are stronger he said PERIOD Id like to know why we chose not to stand as a united front. skeie said it is positive the AFSCME local units are united PERIOD

The leadership is strong I admire Phyllis Walker in trying the best she can to fight for her union members he said PERIOD

Skeie said it is regrettable the two unions did not unite but wishes the AFSCME union members the best of luck in their fight PERIOD

If things came down to a strike the Teamsters will still be there in support of a good fair contract in the snow shivering in the cold. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
