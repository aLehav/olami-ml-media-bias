Texas gaining confidence on defense

Ever since the  loss in the season opener against Maryland a game where the Longhorns defense looked virtually unchanged from the past two seasons woeful performances Texas has experienced a revival on defense PERIOD Since Maryland the defense pitched a shutout against San Jose State held thenNo PERIOD  USC and star quarterback Sam Darnold to just  points in regulation and held Iowa State to seven points on the road PERIOD

Junior defensive end Charles Omenihu one of the Longhorns many veterans on defense said on Tuesday that the game has finally started to slow down and that players are more confident PERIOD

We play a lot faster Omenihu said PERIOD The game isnt fast to us anymore PERIOD If you practice fast youre gonna play fast PERIOD Thats always been the motto that coach Orlando has instilled in us is that you practice how you play. texas not ready to call itself DBU again

One of the biggest reasons for the Longhorns revamped defense this season has been an improved secondary PERIOD Texas is tied for No PERIOD  in the nation in interceptions having earned seven such takeaways thus far PERIOD The Longhorns are also allowing opposing quarterbacks a . completion percentage and surrendering . yards per game through the air PERIOD

Junior safety DeShon Elliott has been the anchor on the back end for Texas PERIOD Hes collected four interceptions alone in the past two games against USC and Iowa State returning one of those for a touchdown PERIOD Elliott was named Big  Defensive Player of the Week following both of those games PERIOD

But Elliott isnt ready to say that Texas is DBU again a term the Longhorns secondary has said they need to earn back after lackluster seasons inrecent years PERIOD

We have done nothing Elliott said PERIOD DBUs still not here PERIOD Thats not for us. dickson shines against Iowa State despite critical error

Junior punter Michael Dickson a Ray Guy Award finalist in  may be one of the Longhorns best players and he showed why once again on Thursday night in Texas  win over
Iowa State PERIOD

The Sydney Australia native booted four punts over  yards against the Cyclones including two that traveled  and  yards PERIOD But a shanked17yard punt late in the third quarter that set up an Iowa State touchdown nearly let the Cyclones back in the game PERIOD Despite the win and Dickson being named the Ray Guy Award Punter of the Week the shanked punt ate at Dickson for a few days following the game PERIOD

Personally I was kicking myself days after it Dickson said PERIOD I feel like Im just starting to personally get over it now PERIOD But puntingwise it wont affect me PERIOD I want to go out there again and hit the next ball. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",Texas players meet with media ahead of Kansas State game â€“ The Daily Texan,University of Texas Austin
