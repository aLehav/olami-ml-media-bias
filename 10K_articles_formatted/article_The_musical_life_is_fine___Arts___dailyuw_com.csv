Discovering a band that boasts two acoustic guitars and an upright bass is difficult in todays music landscape PERIOD Add the fact that The Senate doesnt include a drummer in its lineup and you get a sense of how unique the group really is PERIOD

 said vocalist and rhythm guitarist Nicholas Drummond PERIOD 

The Seattle college environment may have influenced the sound of the band PERIOD Twothirds of the band is currently attending the UW and the music is reminiscent of college favorite Dave Matthews Band thanks to their organic acoustic sound PERIOD Some beats are reminiscent of more traditional African music PERIOD The bands other inspirations vary beyond the obvious college repertoire PERIOD

Each band member has a long varied history with music PERIOD Drummond the only band member not connected to UW grew up playing African drums and picked up the guitar in high school eventually writing and recording a piece for his senior project PERIOD

Guitarist Oliver Franklin studies Russian as a parttime student PERIOD Franklins history includes the middle school band and high school orchestra a classical guitar trio and two groups he was involved in with bassist Andrew Pulkrabek a thrash metal band called Fallen Idol and the experimental Band of Lizards Project PERIOD

Pulkrabek is a lifelong entertainer with street performance and theater under his belt and boasts varied musical efforts including choir jazz a cappella and metal performance PERIOD Hes also is earning a doubledegree in drama and the comparative history of ideas PERIOD

The bands goals are fairly simple Drummond said PERIOD Over the next few months he just wants to see the group in the studio creating an album PERIOD

 Drummond said PERIOD

Pulkrabek also sang the transsexual lead in an Undergraduate Theatre Society performance of Rocky Horror Picture Show last year  but dont let this or any of the bands influences sway your impression of The Senate before you hear their work PERIOD The band has a few streamable songs available on its Web site but seeing the Senates engaging live show is the best way to experience it PERIOD The band plays a free show tomorrow at Cafe Allegro at the College Inn PERIOD The show begins at  p.m PERIOD and is allages PERIOD
