7224,2023-10-31,"what students and parents can learn from the latest college admissions scandal

Ever since news of the college admissions scandal Operation Varsity Blues broke attention has turned to the parents and the idea of lawnmower parents or snowplow parents has entered mainstream media PERIOD Lawnmower parents mow down obstacles their children experience making success easy failure impossible and claiming credit from the child PERIOD Yet the generation who is actually being affected  the kids as the media calls them even though they are all over   are being ignored PERIOD

Its only parents who are being charged since it is only the parents who are acting out stated the Washington Post PERIOD Parents even went to extreme lengths to make sure their children never found out the accomplishments were not theirs PERIOD One parent paid someone to take their childs test then faked proctoring their own kids test so the son would believe the test score was his own PERIOD Not only is this completely immoral but what message are they conveying to their young adult son or daughter What kind of psychological and social damage is this causing

For the number of articles giving advice on How not to be a lawnmower parent there are astoundingly few pieces helping children stand up to their lawnmower parents PERIOD The media focus has taken the solution out of young adults hands who are often the victims of these schemes and recipients of the social humiliation and gone right into the parents PERIOD These students earned merit is completely washed away by their parents overinvolvement and with no way to empower themselves the message from the media echoes that of their own parents We dont trust you to handle any situation yourselves PERIOD

Parents who game the system are telling their children that they cant achieve something on their own Erica Komisar psychoanalyst wrote in The Wall Street Journal article The Sickness Behind the College Scandal PERIOD

When parents use their money or influence to get their kid into an elite institution without considering whether its the right social or academic environment for the child it may be because theyre more concerned about their own status than the childs wellbeing and success PERIOD It can give youngsters a sense of entitlement rather than accomplishment said Komisar who is currently writing a book on raising an adolescent in the age of anxiety PERIOD

In response to the scandal The Wall Street Journal published an article with the apt title Remember its their college years not yours where they argue that so much of the pressure college students feel comes from their parents projection and desire to live vicariously through their children PERIOD Their childrens success is compensation for a parents failure or disappointment i.e. my child must get into an Ivy league school because I didnt PERIOD

Whats even worse is that this suggests that offspring are just a continuation of the parents narrative rather than individual separate beings with dreams goals and flaws of their own PERIOD

Its one thing to teach your children how to learn from your mistakes and to help guide them in the direction they wish to sail PERIOD Its another to completely lawnmow plow and curate the path that you wish you took and then shove them down that road PERIOD Were talking about the difference between Honey would you like me to proofread your college essay and Youll never get in with this Ill just rewrite it. saying Ill do it myself is stripping your child of a learning opportunity not to mention parental attention and leaving them feeling that any and all judgements they make are doomed from the start PERIOD It causes anxiety in decision making and lack of confidence in their own choices PERIOD

In an article called You Need to Teach Your Kids How to Fail Lahey told the Huffington Post Like everyone parents tend to look for concrete indicators of success and progress PERIOD But because there are no parenting report cards or performance evaluations they simply look to their kids achievements and coopt them Parents think My child made the traveling soccer team so that means I get an A for my parenting or They won the science fair PERIOD That means Im an A parent

Not only is our college system so broken that entrance can be purchased but the psychological framework of expecting earned grades for effort continues even after the school ends and far into parenthood PERIOD Even ten or more years after graduating people are still looking for obvious blatant markings of their success in everyday occurrences unable to measure themselves without numbers or letter markings PERIOD

Whats even more ironic The New York Times published an opinion piece titled How much does getting into an elite college actually matter The answer Not much apparently unless you are a firstgen student PERIOD

Students who are poised to succeed tend to do so even if they dont get into the Ivy League said Kevin Carey the director of New America Ed and the author of The End of College in the piece PERIOD It turns out that students who come from less privileged backgrounds benefit greatly from selective colleges PERIOD Elite higher education gives them social capital they didnt already have. muhlenberg meanwhile has some safeguards against the two largest components in Operation Varsity Blues PERIOD First off submitting SAT and ACT scores to Muhlenberg is optional although it is required for merit and honor scholarships PERIOD Instead students can submit a graded paper from high school and interview with a member of the admissions staff PERIOD In other words SAT and ACT scores are not an integral part of getting accepted to Muhlenberg PERIOD

Additionally Muhlenberg is in the NCAAs Division III thus not allowing athletic scholarships to be offered to student athletes PERIOD Instead student athletes can qualify for needbased and academic scholarships like any other student PERIOD

That being said Muhlenberg does and will continue to have a budget to balance and a reputation to maintain PERIOD The Weekly intends to look more closely at the admissions process and the challenges colleges face balancing money and merit in the coming weeks PERIOD So stay tuned the investigation will continue PERIOD

Good opinion pieces on the admission scandal
