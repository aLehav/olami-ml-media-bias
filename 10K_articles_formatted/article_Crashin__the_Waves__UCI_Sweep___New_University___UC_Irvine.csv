The Anteaters hosted the resilient but splotchy Trojans on Wednesday the first of the teams two critical matches of the week PERIOD The Anteaters eliminated any prior questions about their focus as they went on to win in four games     PERIOD

The energy was electric at the start and the players reflected that with a dominating showing in the first set PERIOD They outplayed the fourthranked Trojans for the entirety of the set with some intense momentum on the side of the Anteaters PERIOD

Sometimes its hard to play a random Wednesday night match said Head Coach John Speraw PERIOD It hard to maintain that competitive nature throughout the long grind of the season but it was nice to see we had it against the Trojans tonight. with the exception of a wild second set that saw the Anteaters become outhit . to . it was the rest of the match that mattered as Irvine outblocked the visiting Trojans . to  PERIOD

Sophomore Jordan DuFualt led the fray with  kills and senior Taylor Wilson with  kills and a careerhigh seven block assists PERIOD Senior Ryan Ammerman put in a good showing with  assists and  digs PERIOD

The win happened in front of  fans on Wednesday night but it was a mere warmup for Saturdays match against topranked Pepperdine PERIOD

UCI  Pepperdine 

Get out your brooms and start proclaiming overrated. irvine smoked the topranked team in the nation in straight sets at the Bren Events Center in front of a seasonhigh  fans PERIOD

It was a phenomenal display of Irvines continuing dominance in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation as it improved its record to  overall and  in league play PERIOD

It was all Anteaters from the first serve to the last and Pepperdine had no answers for Irvines onslaught and domination at the net PERIOD It only took the Anteaters three sets to put the Waves away    PERIOD

To win this crucial match the Anteaters prepared all week and needed to focus on how to stop Pepperdines leading hitter Paul Carroll

The preparation worked PERIOD

Carroll did not have a bad night but unlike the last meeting between the two teams where Carroll had  kills the Anteaters held him to just  kills PERIOD This was key to the Anteaters victory over this very  impressive team PERIOD

Ryan Ammerman led the team in stats and presence PERIOD He totaled an impressive  assists three kills five digs five blocks and two aces PERIOD But the big night belonged to the young guys freshman Carson Clark had a teamhigh  kills and sophomore Jordan DuFault knocked down  kills PERIOD

But the seniors didnt fail to impress on senior night PERIOD Senior Taylor Wilson smacked  kills and racked up six block assists as senior Brent Asuka put in a teambest  digs PERIOD Fifthyear senior Jon Steller also made his presence known from the bench as he slotted an ace in the match PERIOD

This was a very important match for the Anteaters and they go into the last two matches of the season now as the favorites to win it all PERIOD It was also important because they are almost guaranteed a home game for the first match of the conference championships PERIOD
