Dismissals from the University of NebraskaLincoln have been increasing since  with about  student dismissals in  PERIOD

A major cause is academic probation PERIOD

I do believe most of our students who are dismissed probably are dismissed for academic reasons said Bill Watts the director of University Advising and Career Services PERIOD

In   students were dismissed from UNL PERIOD Since then  students have been dismissed PERIOD Another reason for dismissal other than academic probation is judicial reasons Watts said PERIOD

Last fall the university brought in Heather Ockenfels to be the director of First Year Experience and Transition Programs PERIOD

Watts said before Ockenfels came to UNL a team was assembled to review the probation process and policies and make the appropriate recommendations PERIOD

We made recommendations around ways that we could enhance our processes around probation to increase a students likelihood of returning to good standing and achieving academic success Watts said PERIOD

The goal of the program is to help reduce the number of students dismissed from UNL on account of academic probation PERIOD In January alone more than  students were helped PERIOD

We have adopted a very proactive approach Ockenfels said PERIOD

Ockenfels came to UNL last fall from the University of Iowa where she helped to build a successful Academic Recovery Program PERIOD She and Watts work together on the program which is set up to work with students to get them out of academic probation PERIOD

The university places a student on Probation I if his or her term and cumulative GPA drops below . pERIOD Once a student is placed on probation a hold is placed on all future registrations and the student has to demonstrate academic progress by completing a semester with both a semester and a cumulative GPA above the . minimum PERIOD If a student fails to do this he or she will be placed on Probation II PERIOD A student will be dismissed from UNL if he or she spends three consecutive semesters on probation according to the undergraduate bulletin PERIOD

When students join this Academic Probation Recovery program they fill out a selfassessment on why they think theyre not succeeding academically PERIOD They then have the freedom to choose their own academic recovery coach who meets with them and creates an Academic Recovery Plan PERIOD

Both Ockenfels and Watts feel that the program is very successful in creating a plan thats unique and tailormade for each student PERIOD

We know each student is different in what they need to be successful Ockenfels said PERIOD

It might be issues with adjustment to college and maybe they were struggling with time management and when to study and how to study PERIOD So that student and that recovery coach might develop a plan thats more around some of the workshops that First Year Experience is doing Watts said PERIOD

The amount of time spent with each student varies depending on the student PERIOD

We can work with a student on a biweekly basis every couple of weeks or maybe just touch base a couple of times a semester Ockenfels said PERIOD

While it may be too early to accurately judge the lasting impact First Year Experience and Transition Programs will have on students struggling with academic probation Ockenfels is confident in the impact that her team is making to reduce the number of students dismissed from campus due to academic probation PERIOD

I am extremely proud to have the support of UNL administration and work collaboratively with academic advisors across campus to change how we support students PERIOD Students should know that we are a great starting point if they are struggling academically she said PERIOD

For now Ockenfels is keeping her focus on the goal which is to Keep em here and keep em committed. newsdailynebraskan.com
