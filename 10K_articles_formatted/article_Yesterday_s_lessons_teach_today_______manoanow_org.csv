Enewetak Atoll before above and after below the Mike Shot was devastated by  separate nuclear weapons detonations PERIOD

As a nuclear chemist by trade University of Hawaii at Manoa
Chancellor Peter Englert knows all too well how the advent of
nuclear weapons changed the world PERIOD

 Englert said at a campus
lecture early this month PERIOD

Englert a young soldier in Germany during the Cold War years
after World War II said that during that period when many
countries were afraid of a possible nuclear attack by the Soviet
Union he received special training for the deployment of nuclear
arms meant to stop Communist tanks if they invaded northern
Germany PERIOD

 said Englert who has since earned three academic
degrees in nuclear chemistry from the University of Cologne in
Germany PERIOD

Englert delivered introductory remarks on Oct PERIOD  at a talk
entitled  which was given by Davor
Pevec the class action attorney for the People of Enewetak PERIOD The
Enwetakese lost their homes and were adversely affected by the
nuclear testing conducted by the U.S PERIOD military beginning in
 PERIOD

Nov PERIOD  marks the fiftieth anniversary of the initial detonation of
the hydrogen bomb codenamed  just one out of  other
nuclear devices detonated on Enewetak a centrally located Pacific
atoll approximately  miles from Honolulu  miles from
Tokyo and  miles from Sydney PERIOD

An internationally respected researcher Englert was decidedly
lowkey and vague in presenting a personal opinion on nuclear arms
and the current White House administrations push for war with
Iraq PERIOD

Englert said he knew about some scientists who inspected Iraq
about  years ago and confirmed that they found evidence of
possible nuclear development going on there at that time PERIOD


Englert said PERIOD

Bringing todays struggle over nuclear weapons proliferation
into focus Englert recalled the history of nuclear development
which began in  under fascist Berlin and Adolf Hitler PERIOD

Otto Hahn a German chemist and Lise Meitner an Austrian
nuclear physicist whose collaborative efforts led to the discovery
of nuclear fission escaped Jewish persecution by fleeing Germany
Englert said PERIOD

At the time they were the only two humans alive who understood
the process of nuclear fission a key component in the detonation
of the hydrogen bomb Englert said PERIOD It was only six years after
their discovery that the nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima
Japan and ended World War II PERIOD

Not believing what he had heard Otto Hahn fell into a deep
depression after confirming that his discovery had been used to
bomb Hiroshima Englert said PERIOD

Reflecting on what he had just said to the mostly young faces
gathered in the sparse audience Englert said that as a nuclear
scientist himself he now understands how these weapons work and
what they really do PERIOD

Older and wiser no longer the young soldier guarding the hills
and plains of Germany Englert soberly addressed the crowd
