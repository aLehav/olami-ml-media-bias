You cant always choose your family but in Chasing The Sun viewers can choose to find it again PERIOD

Directed by Jeremy Mackie and scored by Jason Staczek Chasing The Sun follows two longseparated siblings played by Jesse Keeter and Samara Lerman who go on an illconceived road trip when they discover they have different opinions about their longburied family history PERIOD The film sees the brother and sister find and reconnect with their mother trying to answer questions about their past they never thought to ask PERIOD

Mackie who graduated from the UW with a bachelors degree in English literature currently lives in Singapore a place not as supportive of his craft as Seattle PERIOD

The difference is like night and day Mackie said PERIOD Singapore isnt a super free artistic community and it doesnt have the same artistic drive like in Seattle. mackies decadelong career in film has seen him work as a gaffer a grip and a lighting technician on major motion pictures like Twilight Green Room and Captain Fantastic. in  Mackie made his directorial debut with While You Werent Looking a short film about a young girls unsupervised adventure in a grocery cart PERIOD Chasing The Sun marks his directorial return to familythemed stories PERIOD

We wanted this film to be simple and as rooted in acting as possible Mackie said PERIOD Its just a little piece of dramatic honesty. shot in a small town in Snohomish County east of Everett Mackies work on Chasing The Sun began in December of  PERIOD From a romantic comedy to an urban Dukes of Hazzard set in Seattle the films premise was wide open before Mackie Keeter and Lerman decided to make it a family drama PERIOD

The following four years allowed time for the cast to brainstorm ideas for the films script a collection of semiautobiographical experiences from the trios own childhoods PERIOD

It was really like making a film with family Mackie said PERIOD Everybody was there because they wanted to be there. even as a selfdescribed preplanner Mackies inclination toward efficient production never prevented him from lending Keeter and Lerman the creative freedom to improvise PERIOD

Having worked together on films like The Gamers Hands of Fate Keeter and Lermans familiarity enabled them to make the most out of their performances PERIOD

If youre lucky enough to build relationships with your costars on set you teach yourself to let your guard down and you learn to play fast Keeter said PERIOD You learn to skip steps one and two and be a bit more real and relaxed. lerman described her character as the films moral compass always striving for the best results PERIOD

My character is a peacemaker and she wants to bring her family back together Lerman said PERIOD Shes a person who wants to heal all wounds solve all problems and discovers that nothing is like she expected. meanwhile Keeter teased his character as a doubter who gets more than he imagined PERIOD

My character is lured on a road trip under false pretenses with a sister who hes apprehensive about at first to address family issues that have gone unresolved for a long time Keeter said PERIOD By the end brother and sister grow much closer. at just  minutes long Chasing The Sun is a short film with little time to kill PERIOD For Mackie  minutes is still long enough to be ambitious PERIOD

Making films like these is about giving yourself permission to fail Mackie said PERIOD You dont have a safety net its not something to please everyone. for Keeter this isnt just a film about two people looking to reconnect with a loved one but one about the power of two honest performances PERIOD

Chasing the Sun is about connection and honesty Keeter said PERIOD There arent any big tricks its trying to pull PERIOD Its about honest performances from everyone involved. chasing The Sun will air on KCTS  on July  as part of the Reel NW series PERIOD
