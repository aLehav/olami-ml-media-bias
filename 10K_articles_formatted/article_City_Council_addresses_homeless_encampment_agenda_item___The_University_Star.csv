Agenda item  which was a discussion item made by Councilmember Shane Scott was described as not allowing the homeless to camp out or panhandle in San Marcos city limits or ETJ and what our police need to help with the effort of enforcement. because of its wording in the agenda many citizens and council members were confused about what the item was asking to discuss. various community members spoke during the meetings public comment session expressing they were against any form of criminalizing homelessness and did not support the discussion PERIOD However before council members could get to the agenda item they were interrupted by demonstrators outside City Hall protesting the discussion of a camping ban which at the time is what they assumed the agenda item was proposing PERIOD
