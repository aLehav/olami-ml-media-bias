2227,2022-03-16,"ive been poring over press clippings from Obamas past looking for inconsistencies and flipflops PERIOD There are virtually none gushed David Brooks U of C alum and New York Times columnist in a December  column PERIOD If Brooks were to write the column today though hed have a lot more press clippings to pore over and a lot more flipflops to dissect PERIOD

Obamas record on free trade is a case study in a politicians pandering to special interests despite knowing better PERIOD While campaigning in Ohio a bastion of unions and protectionists Obama proclaimed NAFTA was devastating and a big mistake but when the primary was over he tacked toward the middle admitting that sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified. the real question is what Obama genuinely believes PERIOD People say a lot of things about him but nobodys ever accused him of being dumb PERIOD Thats why it would be astonishing if he were truly against free trade PERIOD The economic consensus is clear More than  percent of economists in a recent American Economist Association survey supported removing barriers to free trade PERIOD Many of Obamas top economic advisorslike Larry Summers Austan Goolsbee and Jason Furmanare outspoken supporters of free trade PERIOD And yet we still have to deal with Obamas implementation of a tariff on Chinese tire imports PERIOD

Then theres campaign finance reform PERIOD Obama and John McCain promised at the beginning of their presidential campaigns that each would accept public funds if they were their parties respective nominees PERIOD Yet lo and behold Obama broke that pledge because it was politically inconvenient PERIOD Obama claimed that he was leveling the playing field against evil Republican  groupsin other words two wrongs made a right PERIOD This assertion turned out to be false as 527s played a negligible part in the election. obama had the chance to prove that he was truly a politician of a different stripe one willing to stand on principle for a system he had claimed to support instead he chose what every politician chooses selfinterest PERIOD

When I ask Obama supporters about his opposition to gay marriage almost without exception they blithely reply Hes not really against it. im inclined to agree with that PERIOD Obama opposed Proposition  the ballot initiative in California that banned gay marriage PERIOD How can someone who is against gay marriage also oppose a measure like Prop  Its not a states rights issue which is one argument that opponents of gay marriage make while opposing a Constitutional amendment banning the practice PERIOD Its a straightforward vote for any real opponent of samesex marriage PERIOD Its impossible to reconcile Obamas opposition to Prop  and his stated opposition to gay marriage PERIOD

It appears that Obama genuinely supports gay marriage but believes its too politically risky to do so publicly PERIOD So he states his theoretical opposition to the practice but when practical legislation comes through that would restrict samesex marriage hes against it PERIOD

Whats depressing is that his calculation was probably wrong PERIOD Theres little question in my mind that Obama could still be president even if he had supported gay marriage PERIOD In fact he likely would have had an easier time winning the Democratic primary in the general election its hard to imagine samesex marriage becoming a major issue in the campaign with the economys collapse PERIOD

But Obama chose to be riskaverseno viable presidential candidate has ever supported gay marriagerather than take a chance PERIOD Thats understandable politicians make these calculations as a matter of course PERIOD What it shows though is that Obama is a politician just like the rest PERIOD

And yet I believe Obama really is differentsmarter more intellectually honest more thoughtfulwhich is why I find his willingness to play the usual political games so discouraging PERIOD George Bushs excuse was that he wasnt all that smart PERIOD Whats Obamas
