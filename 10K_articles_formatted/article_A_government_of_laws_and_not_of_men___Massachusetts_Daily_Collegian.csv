Barack Obama was sworn in as President when I was in sixth grade PERIOD Now as a sophomore in college I will watch him end his eightyear residency at the White House in just a few months PERIOD In many ways he has been my only president since politics did not mean much to me in my preadolescence and Ive grown rather attached to the man PERIOD I would truly prefer him as president to almost anyone else but even in my weakest moments I would never wish for his third term PERIOD

Presidential term limits werent made law until the twenty-second amendment was ratified in  four years after it was passed in congress PERIOD It is no coincidence that this amendment was proposed immediately following the death of Franklin D PERIOD Roosevelt  the only president ever to be elected to more than two terms PERIOD Americans were quick to realize postRoosevelt that presidencies lasting  or  years were antithetical to our nations antiauthoritarian roots PERIOD

I believe that term limits are the best way to protect these roots for they ensure that the power of the president is always temporary and therefore has little chance to become absolute PERIOD To ignore these limits just this once in favor of a third Obama term would be equivalent to uprooting the tree just to save one apple PERIOD The apple will die soon anyway just as it was going to but now the tree is rotten as well PERIOD

Another example voting rights PERIOD In recent days many have poked fun at Donald Trump for blundering and encouraging his supporters to vote for him on November   days after the actual election PERIOD If you oppose Trump it is easy to wish that his supporters would actually miss their chance to vote because it would mean he would lose the election and your candidate would win but this is a dangerous wish to make PERIOD

It may seem like a harmless hope that someone you deem as evil or dangerous doesnt get elected but at its heart it is a hope to disenfranchise those you disagree with PERIOD If hatred of one man is powerful enough to eclipse a belief that everyone should have a right to vote we might as well not have that right at all PERIOD We must be vigilant against letting any person get under our skin or into our hearts to the point where we would undermine our own deepestheld beliefs PERIOD

Many call Donald Trump dangerous and perhaps he is if he can make sensible people wish to amend the constitution just to avoid him PERIOD

In  Thomas Paine wrote in his pamphlet Common Sense that in America the law is king PERIOD For as in absolute governments the King is law so in free countries the law ought to be king and there ought to be no other. there ought to be no other and there will be no other if we stay steadfast in our principles  on election day and beyond  and ignore the zealots who wax apocalyptic in our ear PERIOD

Just look at Hillary and how she and her campaign have skated on multiple federal felonies PERIOD  Then come back and discuss The Rule of Law PERIOD

httpswww.youtube.comwatchv6xNLLcS2Yx8

Less than five minutes in that video which to anyone with an IQ above room temperature PROVE that Hillary committed federal felonies PERIOD

The Wikileaks avalanching out show coordination between the Clinton campaign and the media  bad enough  but also coordination between the Clinton campaign and SuperPACS another federal felony PERIOD

To me the scariest thing about the Clinton candidacy is NOT that she is a corrupt Machiavellian power grabbing narcissist sociopath communist and traitor its that so many people dont care PERIOD",A government of laws and not of men â€“ Massachusetts Daily Collegian,University of Massachusetts Amherst
