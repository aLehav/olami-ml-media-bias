The Michigan novice womens rowing team struggled in its first race of the year against Michigan State on Sunday morning but coach Liz Tuppen isnt concerned with the results PERIOD

The Spartans led the pack sweeping the Wolverines in all five of the first flights races PERIOD With a rating cap of  strokes per minute Sundays race was a test of the rowers ability to produce speed PERIOD When the rating is set as low as it was for these races consistent power application on the front end is the key to success PERIOD

They have a lot of race in them but they have to be more effective with what theyre doing and how theyre trying to apply that power said Tuppen the firstyear novice coach PERIOD

In the second race Michigan put up its best fight of the first flight PERIOD It came off the starting line strong and got out to a quick jump on Michigan State but the Wolverines couldnt hold on PERIOD The Spartans first novice boat 1N gutted out a victory over the Wolverines by four seats PERIOD Besides the second race Michigan State beat Michigans 1N by onehalf to oneandahalf boat lengths of open water PERIOD

Though the Spartans owned the first flight they didnt dominate the show PERIOD The second flight was a race between Michigan State and Michigans third and fourth novice boats PERIOD In this flight the Wolverines were able to win four of the five races all within a boat length of the Spartans third novice boat PERIOD

Overall Tuppen was pleased with the racing she saw PERIOD She thought her team showed a lot of fight and was particularly pleased with Michigans 2N win over the Michigan 1N in the fifth piece of the first flight PERIOD

The 2N probably had the most consistent performance of the day Tuppen said emphasizing the importance of intersquad competition on future success PERIOD

Sunday was the first race for many of the firstyear rowers so some mistakes were expected PERIOD

In the fourth piece of the first flight the Michigan 1N caught a crab when the oar gets stuck in the water and ended up losing to MSUs 1N by a boatandahalf PERIOD The second flight suffered two collisions PERIOD The first occurred in the first heat between the Wolverines and Spartans fourth novice boats while the second was between the schools third novice boats in their fifth and final race of the day PERIOD

On the other hand Michigan coxswains appeared to have stepped up to the challenge PERIOD In a day full of unseasoned nerves and uncertainty Tuppen was pleased with her coxswains ability to execute and handle Sundays complexities PERIOD

Michigan State may have walked away with the victory but as a whole Sundays race was a pivotal point in these rowers careers PERIOD With their first race under their belt both teams now know what it feels like to compete in the Big Ten and have a better understanding of what it takes to succeed in the future PERIOD
