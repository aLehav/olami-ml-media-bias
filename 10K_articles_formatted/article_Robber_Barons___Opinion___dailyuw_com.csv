Robber Barons Subsidized railroads destroy Northwest forests Cameron Chapman Daily Staff

In Western society private property is enshrined as the noblest of institutions PERIOD However the expropriation of land from common holding into private hands is a violation of the general public interest PERIOD Such transfers often take place behind closed doors where the general public can safely be ignored.Here in the Northwest the history of our forests is a perfect of example of the way in which our federal government acts primarily in the interests of extremely wealthy businessmen and not in the greater public interest PERIOD This history also shows that subsidizing the wealthy does not help the general public as is so often proclaimed PERIOD In  Congress conditionally granted millions of acres of land to the Northern Pacific Railroad company for the purpose of building and maintaining a railroad from Lake Superior to the Pacific Ocean PERIOD These lands were comprised of a 200milewide rightofway and  million acres to raise capital needed to build and maintain the railroad.The extent of this giveaway was unprecedented PERIOD Realizing this Congress enacted several conditions to this grant yet rarely enforced them PERIOD Northern Pacific continually violated the conditions of the agreement and when it couldnt it twisted the arms of Congressmen to change the grant provisions to suit their needs PERIOD Investment banker Jay Cooke used his wealth to in his words gain the votes of recalcitrant Congressmen. there were also many Congressmen at the time who had financial interests in the railroads.One of the most important stipulations that Northern Pacific violated was the requirement to open the lands to settlement by homesteaders within five years of the completion of the railroad PERIOD Instead they held on to these lands or sold them relatively cheaply to wealthy capitalists like Frederick Weyerhaeuser who had close ties to the railroad interests PERIOD These and other stipulations remained in the contract but were violated repeatedly.There was indeed a laundry list of violations by the railroad magnates benefiting from the grant who wanted to keep this publiclyderived wealth in the hands of the rich PERIOD To name a few Northern Pacific never sold stock to the public as was required. the Northern Pacific claimed . million acres too many in Washington. surveying was delayed to avoid paying taxes.Perhaps the most offensive violation of Northern Pacific was their treatment of Native Americans PERIOD They wrongfully received . million acres located within Native American reservations PERIOD In  Chief Sitting Bull stated I hate you PERIOD I hate you PERIOD I hate all the white people PERIOD You are thieves and liars PERIOD You have taken away our land and made us outcasts so I hate you.His sentiments were widely shared.One frightening result of the landgrant legacy is the domination of the forests by a small number of private companies whose attention to shortterm gain will always be in conflict with sustainability PERIOD In the 1890s J.P PERIOD Morgan and James J PERIOD Hill combined Northern Pacific and Great Northern to establish a railroad monopoly across the northern states PERIOD This merger resulted in the formation of Burlington Northern which then began to spin off timber subsidiaries such as Plum Creek Timber Company PERIOD Plum Creek owns  percent of timber industry lands in Montana and huge amounts in Idaho and Washington and because it is a limited partnership it pays no corporate income tax PERIOD Fred Weyerhaeuser also benefited from his close relationship with the railroad magnates buying cheap lands and establishing other timber giants such as Potlatch and Boise Cascade PERIOD Currently Weyerhaeuser Plum Creek Potlatch and Boise Cascade have a stranglehold on the forests of the Northwest PERIOD Such hegemony by these companies is not in the greater public interest although it may be in the interest of the executives and relatively small number of shareholders of those companies PERIOD The ownership of these lands by a small amount of landholders is in direct opposition to the public lands policy that Congress was ostensibly nurturing in the mid19th century PERIOD Our elected officials betrayed the majority to enrich an already wealthy minority.Among the many problems these policies have spawned one deserves special mention PERIOD Reckless logging has caused damage beyond the aesthetic nightmare of treestumps swathes both ecologically and hydrologically PERIOD Conservationists who now wish to preserve cherished untouched lands from such a death must lobby public entities to buy them back from the timber companies.But the timber companies should not own this land.When land management issues are discussed today the legacy of the land grant is never examined PERIOD In fact public entities have now taken to buying back lands from these landgrant timber companies to ensure that popular wilderness areas such as Scatter Creek and Rattlesnake Mountain will not be harmed PERIOD This is a huge transfer of wealth from the public coffers into the hands of the wealthy PERIOD Such issues would not be a concern if the law had been enforced in the first place.Businesses such as Plum Creek and Weyerhaeuser operate under principles that put shortterm profits first and our forests have been devastated as a result PERIOD Sustainability is never a concern for these businesses and as long as consumers continue to think of them as the benevolent tree people they will continue with such malfeasance PERIOD If you are interested learning more about the  Congressional Land Grant and its currentday political economic and environmental implications there will be a talk this week hosted by the UW Greens and the Student Action Network PERIOD George Draffan author of the book Railroads and Clearcuts will give a lecture and slideshow tonight at  p.m. Gould Hall Room  PERIOD There is no charge for admission PERIOD
