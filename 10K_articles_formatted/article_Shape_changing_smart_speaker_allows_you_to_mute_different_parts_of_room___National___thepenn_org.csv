The shapechanging smart speakers PERIOD April HongUniversity of Washington via SWNS

By Stephen Beech via SWNS

A new shapechanging smart speaker allows users to  different areas of a room PERIOD

The stateoftheart sound system developed by American scientists uses selfdeploying microphones to divide rooms into  and track the positions of individual speakers PERIOD

The ability to locate and control sound  for example isolating one person talking from a specific location in a crowded room  has previously challenged researchers especially without visual cues from cameras PERIOD

With the help of deeplearning algorithms the new system lets users mute certain areas or separate simultaneous conversations even if two adjacent people have similar voices PERIOD

The research team described how  like a fleet of Roomba speakers each about an inch in diameter  the microphones automatically deploy from and then return to a charging station PERIOD

They say that allows the system to be moved between environments and set up automatically PERIOD

Study colead author Malek Itani said that in a conference room meeting for instance such a system might be deployed instead of a central microphone allowing better control of inroom audio PERIOD

Itani a doctoral student at the University of Washington said If I close my eyes and there are  people talking in a room I have no idea whos saying what and where they are in the room exactly PERIOD

If someone else is closer to the microphone thats two feet away their voice will arrive there first PERIOD

We developed neural networks that use these timedelayed signals to separate what each person is saying and track their positions in a space PERIOD



He added Or if two groups are speaking beside each other and one group is having a private conversation while the other group is recording one conversation can be in a mute zone and it will remain private. originally published on talker.news part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange PERIOD
