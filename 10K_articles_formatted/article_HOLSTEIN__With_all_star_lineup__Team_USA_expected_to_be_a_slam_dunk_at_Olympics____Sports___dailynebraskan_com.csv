They may not be the dream team but the  USA Olympic basketball team is stacked nonetheless PERIOD

The latest set of all stars assembled for the games in London looks like something out of a video game PERIOD There isnt a player on the roster that couldnt score  points on a given night PERIOD

The team includes much of the NBAs top talent LeBron James Kevin Durant Kobe Bryant Kevin Love Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook just to name a few stars PERIOD But equally impressive is the teams depth PERIOD Even the lesserknown players if you can call them that are electric athletes as well PERIOD Deron Williams of the Nets and Tyson Chandler of the Knicks are the smallest names on the team but each are major contributors to their teams PERIOD Williams averages  points per game and Chandler averages about  rebounds a game PERIOD These guys are no slouches PERIOD

Basketball is Americas game and its imperative for Team USA to win the gold at this summers Olympics PERIOD We invented basketball and for the most part we are the ones that play it PERIOD Sure other nations have leagues and players but they arent like the leagues and players in America PERIOD Basketball has been embraced by this country in a way that it hasnt been embraced in other countries and America has to win for that reason PERIOD Its our game PERIOD

The way Americans feel about basketball during the Olympics is similar in many ways to the way Canadians feel about hockey during the Olympics PERIOD Canada is the preeminent nation in the sport of hockey PERIOD A high percentage of the professional talent comes from that nation and when they put together a national team they feel that they have to win the gold medal PERIOD Anything else is a failure PERIOD

For America basketball is actually even more of a mustwin sport than that PERIOD Canada actually has a handful of legitimate competitors in the Olympics PERIOD America for one is always a threat to the Canadians on the ice but America lacks any sort of competition when it comes to basketball PERIOD

When Team USA was knocked out of gold medal contention by Argentina in  it shocked the world PERIOD Argentina Yes Argentina the South American nation lead by Manu Ginobili won gold over an American team busting at the seams with talent PERIOD

How did that happen

There really is no good answer to that question PERIOD It was a huge disappointment and an awakening for most Americans PERIOD Team USA previously thought to be invincible lost to a team with a tiny fraction of the stars and talent of the American squad PERIOD The memory of that loss still stings and although the  team got American back on top there is still work to be done to get the bad taste out of peoples mouths PERIOD

The  version of Team USA is about as good as it could possibly be PERIOD America has the consensus top two players in the world on its side in James and Durant PERIOD Fresh off their meeting in the NBA Finals the two players should be ready to go PERIOD

America also has the experience necessary to win as it returns a handful of players from its  gold medalwinning roster PERIOD

When the stage is set and the lights are on in London this team has to win PERIOD There is no excuse for them to finish with anything less than a gold medal PERIOD There isnt a team out there that can compete with them PERIOD

Simply put they have to get it done PERIOD
