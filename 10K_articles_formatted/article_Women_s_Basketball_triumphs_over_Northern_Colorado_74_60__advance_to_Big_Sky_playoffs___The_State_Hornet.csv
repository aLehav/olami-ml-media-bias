The atmosphere was energetic Saturday as the Sacramento State womens basketball team took on the Bears of Northern Colorado PERIOD

It was winnertakeall as the winner headed to the Big Sky Conference Tournament and the loser would begin its offseason conditioning earlier than it would have liked PERIOD

Northern Colorado started using a fullcourt defense in which jumpstarted a  run for the Bears PERIOD
