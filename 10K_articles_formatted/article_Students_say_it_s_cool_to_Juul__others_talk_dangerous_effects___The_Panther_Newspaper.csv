When sophomore Tiffany Yang vaped half of her Juul pod in one day she threw up from the high amounts of nicotine PERIOD Since then shes vomited twice more from overusing the device but she and many other Chapman students continue to use Juuls PERIOD

A Juul is an ecigarette that provides users with a strong dose of nicotine and it has gained popularity among younger generations PERIOD Although Juuls website claims that the product is not meant for minors the company recognizes that underage use of its products is an issue PERIOD In  Chapman became asmokefree campus including vaping and using ecigarettes but many students continue to Juul and vape on campus PERIOD

When I walk to class I see people Juuling all over the place said Chiara Squillantini a sophomore business administration major PERIOD Its very common at Chapman PERIOD If you go to Starbucks and youre sitting outside youll see a lot of people Juuling in the corner. the ecigarette device was designed to help those struggling to quit smoking regular cigarettes and its not intended for people who havent smoked before according to JUUL Labs PERIOD Still its sleek appearance can attract college students and other young people something the company calls a persistent problem. people assume youre cool if youre Juuling PERIOD Its a statement Yang said PERIOD Everyone wants a Juul because its recognizable attractive and cool PERIOD Its small and you can only charge it through a USB so in that sense it really is targeted for our generation. for Squillantini using her Juul is less about getting the nicotine headrush and more about having something to do similar to the purpose of a fidget spinner PERIOD She said she Juuls before and after class before she goes to bed and first thing in the morning PERIOD

Im not sure I would say that Im addicted but its just so easy that if its in front of me Ill do it she said PERIOD If I had something that was similar with no nicotine Id still use it PERIOD At this point I dont get a headrush every time PERIOD Its a gadget that gives me something to do. chapman became a smokefree campus in  but some students still smoke on campus PERIOD Photo by Bonnie Cash

Marketing the product as a cigarette replacement can be dangerous for younger generations who have never smoked said Bonnie HalpernFelsher a pediatrics professor at Stanford University PERIOD

A lot of younger people were not smoking cigarettes in the first place so its being used as a brand new product HalpernFelsher told The Panther PERIOD Thats scary PERIOD Theres a lot of harm in doing that. each Juul pod contains59 milligrams of nicotine which is the equivalent of one pack of cigarettes according to the Juul website PERIOD Although the Juul hasnt been on the market long enough for its longterm effects to be studied HalpernFelsher said that researchers believe it will follow the same effects as other vaping devices as well as the general effects of nicotine such as addiction and difficulty exerting energy and breathing PERIOD

The pods flavor options like creme brulee and mango also contribute to Juuls popularity among younger crowds PERIOD

They actually taste good which is appealing Squillantini said PERIOD Ill be shopping and think that I want to try a new flavor and then I want to try another so I keep buying them and using them. yangs tolerance to the nicotine headrush has also increased but she uses her Juul because its convenient and trendy  and its small size makes it easy for people to use in class without anyone noticing PERIOD

Most of the time I dont even get a headrush anymore she said PERIOD I still hit my Juul because I like the vape coming out and it gives me something to play with PERIOD Our society is always into something and Juuls are the next big thing PERIOD Everyone wants one. yang believes that Juuls marketing is effective as it makes the device seem harmless and trendy PERIOD

Cigarettes are known to hurt people and weve seen the scary commercials and have heard what they do to people but Juuls are used by cool people like YouTubers and people who are considered popular she said PERIOD It doesnt seem risky PERIOD Even on their Instagram Juul uses people who look young and trendy in their pictures with their products PERIOD Youre not dirty if you Juul youre cool. made with Squarespace","Students say it’s cool to Juul, others talk dangerous effects — The Panther Newspaper",Chapman University
