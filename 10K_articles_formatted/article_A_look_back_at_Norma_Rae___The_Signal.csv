8810,2023-11-05,"the story of Crystal Lee Sutton the real life Norma Rae reveals how cultural change in the 1960s and 1970s created an economic shift for working class women in the South PERIOD

Ph.D PERIOD candidate Joey Fink discussed her ongoing dissertation on Tuesday about the many Norma Raes a term coined by the  film Norma Rae to describe a woman who holds a strong opinion and acts as a leader and activist for a cause much like Sutton and her character in the iconic film PERIOD

The film Norma Rae is based on the biography of Suttons life and how gender class and social expectations shape working class womens politics of the time PERIOD

Sutton worked as a towel folder at J.P PERIOD Stevens Textile plant PERIOD This working class woman began to work closely with union organizer Eli Zivkovic and the plant soon fired her for her activist work PERIOD

In the film Norma Rae Sutton portrayed by actress Sally Fields stands on a desk and raises a cardboard sign reading UNION PERIOD The women in the factory all cut off their machines PERIOD

Sutton received a police escort out of the building PERIOD Although she was fired and arrested her literal stand led to The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Unions representing J.P PERIOD Stevens workers in  PERIOD

Sutton did not have a spotless reputation PERIOD Though the 70s was blooming into a time of acceptance the conservative South still looked down on a woman who had an extramarital affair and a child out of wedlock PERIOD

Fink shared this pivotal detail in Suttons story to point out that during this time to be a woman activist was seen as being sexually deviant. many women were silenced by their own sexuality PERIOD

Sutton brazenly faced her own sexual history and stood up for unionized labor PERIOD Fink pointed out that the question remains as to how many women kept quiet in fear of their own indiscretions being exposed PERIOD

Theres a lot of strong independent ballsy women in my family who may not have been on the frontlines of labor campaigns who may not have identified as feminist but nonetheless the role that they played in my life it was about standing up for yourself for others and justice Fink said about her familys role in her interest in activism PERIOD

Fink conducted her dissertation research through several personal narratives and the Southern Labor Archives at the GSU Library earning her this years Reed Fink Award for using these archives for her dissertation PERIOD
