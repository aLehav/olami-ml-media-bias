Now and again we all forget the preschool dictum that told us to 

We cut people off in our cars we close the elevator doors when we hear footsteps we tip less than  percent PERIOD

All are minor infractions with lessthanserious consequences PERIOD But when it comes to controversial subjects such as political and religious differences tossing out the Golden Rule can do a lot of damage PERIOD

Case in point Young Americans for Freedom hosted an event Tuesday night that invited Jihad Watch director Robert Spencer to criticize Penn States Muslim Student Association to a crowd of about  PERIOD While Spencers controversial views are worth dissecting his message and desire for  were lost on the small audience and onesided format PERIOD

In their attempt to confront Spencer during his speech members of the Muslim Student Association MSA also didnt set the best example PERIOD Their concerns about the nature of Spencers message are legitimate but angry interruptions are not a constructive way to get a point across and not an invitation to be taken seriously PERIOD

With Tuesday nights event both sides had an opportunity to take the high road  and failed PERIOD

The discussion about jihadist movements is both timely and relevant and deserves far more than a stump speech on a week night PERIOD Perhaps student interest would climb if members of the MSA and Jihad Watch set up a roundtable discussion or structured debate PERIOD

In his speech Tuesday night Spencer said  If this is true then why preach at likeminded individuals instead of presenting your argument to the students you accuse of radical activities

Though considerably more lowkey a discussion of religious symbols at the Pasquerilla Spiritual Center on the same night served as a much better example of bringing different views together PERIOD Though the discussion didnt address anything as controversial as jihad it showed how enlightening an event can be when its based on openness and civility PERIOD

In a diverse institution of higher education groups with opposing viewpoints should have the good sense to hash out their conflicts in a mature and educational way PERIOD Preaching yelling and overall rudeness do nothing to inform anyone and end up making both sides look foolish PERIOD

In the future hopefully even nuanced issues such as faith and the war on terror can be discussed in a manner that positively reflects on the Penn State community PERIOD With a better understanding of one another we all might be even more apt to play nice PERIOD
