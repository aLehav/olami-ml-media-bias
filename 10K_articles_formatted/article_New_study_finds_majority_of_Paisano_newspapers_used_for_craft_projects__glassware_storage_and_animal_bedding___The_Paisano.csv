A new study conducted by the Newspaper Society of America NSA confirms that most issues of the student run studentprovided and independentlyfunded newspaper the Paisano are used for impromptu craft projects storage of glassware or fine china and as toiletry for puppies and small rodents PERIOD

The findings show that while a handful of people read the newspaper crafted by unpaid students for the university and their peers often a majority of the papers go unread and get used for more pressing craft projects such as papier mch fiesta masks or P20 initiative chair creating competitions in the UC ballroom PERIOD

We want young students to visit our campus and experience what its like to be a Roadrunner themselves said the P20 initiative assistant vice president carefully gluing and forming the satire writers face and article from the Paisano newspaper into a flimsy chair to be sat upon PERIOD These students should know what kind of great experiences they will have as a student at UTSA said the assistant quietly stomping on top of all the freshly printed student newspaper around him PERIOD

Staff and students alike have praised the Paisano for its awardwinning glassware and china protecting abilities which have saved many bowls mugs plates and sensitive items for those who have had to look quickly outside their classroom or office for any available newspaper PERIOD

I love the Paisano said researcher and Professor Mark Markington who has grabbed a copy of the Paisano on multiple occasions PERIOD The quality of the paper is excellent the newspaper is perfect for protecting my awards and collection of Precious Moments figurines when I want to take them home. the study goes on to reveal that shredded news and sports articles are the most effective in keeping a clean guinea pig cage with the arts  life sections coming in third PERIOD

Interestingly enough the opinion section has been reported as extremely ineffective with little use and most study participants noted that the section containing the personal thoughts and beliefs of student writers was the one they threw quickly away into the trash or recycle PERIOD
