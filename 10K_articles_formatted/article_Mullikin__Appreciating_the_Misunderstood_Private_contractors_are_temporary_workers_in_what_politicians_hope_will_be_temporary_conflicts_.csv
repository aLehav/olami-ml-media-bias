Private contractors are temporary workers in what politicians hope will be temporary conflicts PERIOD

Blackwater PERIOD Triple Canopy PERIOD DynCorp PERIOD KBR PERIOD According to some employees of these four security giants are mercenaries PERIOD While they generally prefer the term civilian contractors they are modern corporate warriors PERIOD The civilian contractors mostly exsoldiers or former police officers draw their paychecks from shortterm contracts with the Pentagon or State Department and are motivated by just that  the paycheck PERIOD According to an adage of the business a contractor is motivated by the opportunity to kill the enemies of my country and to finally get that boat Ive always wanted. they are not soldiers because quite frankly soldiering doesnt pay well enough PERIOD The Pentagon has employed private military contractors since the end of the Cold War PERIOD Since then they have fundamentally changed the way America fights her wars as the privatization of security has expanded to a multibilliondollar global industry PERIOD The United States had deployed  soldiers and  contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan combined as of March   PERIOD The ratio of contractors to soldiers in Iraq was  and even higher in Afghanistan PERIOD Annually the United States spends  billion on contractor services PERIOD Contractors are temporary workers in what politicians hope will be temporary conflicts PERIOD The average contractor in Iraq signs a threemonth contract and makes  or more per day PERIOD When the three months are over the contractor is done PERIOD The Pentagon has no further commitment to its former employee at least until he signs another contract PERIOD By comparison an enlisted soldier in the Army serves for at least eight years while the government foots the bill for thousands of dollars of training thousands of dollars of health care insurance and if the soldier is married thousands of dollars of benefits for his or her family PERIOD At a high cost to the government a soldier cashes paychecks in pennies compared to the average civilian contractor PERIOD And these soldiers arent necessarily boots on the ground finger on the trigger warriors PERIOD For every infantryman several support troops are required to keep him combateffective PERIOD Someone has to do his laundry cook his food transport his ammunition and translate the intelligence that directs his operations PERIOD From an operational perspective its only logical to hire out the menial tasks that Americas soldiers currently perform PERIOD The tasks outlined above are usually contracted to companies like Kellogg Brown Root the largest force provider in Iraq other than the U.S PERIOD military PERIOD As of now their work remains relatively free of controversy PERIOD On the other hand companies like Blackwater Worldwide recently renamed Xe Services Triple Canopy and DynCorp come far closer to the traditional definition of a mercenary PERIOD Their contracts are more dangerous ranging from transport jobs in Fallujah  one such mission led to the deaths and brutal mutilation of four Blackwater contractors  to providing security for regional government offices which are routinely threatened by suicide bombs and other attacks PERIOD Contractors on these assignments often carry more weapons and ammunition  than an infantry fire team according to the halfjoking email chain PERIOD They are under orders to fire on any vehicle that comes too close to their convoys and they dont hesitate to do so PERIOD This is where the controversy surrounding contractors stems from PERIOD When Blackwater contractors killed  Iraqi civilians in Baghdads Nisour Square in September  the company was blown apart PERIOD While the details behind the killings are still disputed Blackwaters license to operate in Iraq was officially revoked the next day for what the U.S PERIOD and Iraqi governments claim was an unprovoked attack on civilians PERIOD Blackwater is not the only company that has been scrutinized and condemned by the federal government PERIOD DynCorp for example has been accused of sex slavery and prostitution in Bosnia and wasting millions of dollars on unnecessary projects such as building a swimming pool on orders from the Iraqi police PERIOD Despite these controversies both humanitarian groups and the U.S PERIOD government are still using private military companies in Iraq and Afghanistan PERIOD As the military withdraws from Iraq the State Department plans to double the number of contractors it employs for security to  PERIOD Contractors will continue to have a critical role in Afghanistan as well despite the protests of Hamid Karzai the Afghan president PERIOD Private military contractors arent going away anytime soon PERIOD Instead their role is continuing to grow because of their lowcost and efficiency PERIOD Contractors are hired guns and theyre very good ones PERIOD As American commitments abroad continue to shift and change so will contractors roles PERIOD One thing however is certain Private military companies have solidified their role as an integral part of the American security and defense industries PERIOD Andrew Mullikin is a sophomore in the School of Foreign Service PERIOD He can be reached at
