5255,2015-10-16,"stanford researchers have concluded that MOOCs massive open online courses havent quite been the revolutionary change in education for which they had hoped PERIOD Completion rates are low and classes can be too difficult PERIOD In addition instead of providing students in developing countries a path to education the majority of online students are men from industrialized countries PERIOD

Examining how these online students learn and fail however has given researchers data on how to improve both online and physical classrooms PERIOD The idea of online courses  where anyone with an Internet connection can tap into an abundance of knowledge and change the lives of students in developing countries  has been incredibly attractive to researchers in education PERIOD

Professor of computer science John Mitchell  who has taught and done research around MOOCs noted in an interview with the Stanford News Service that helping people around the world learn is going to be much harder than simply putting these courses online. highlevel online courses may end up too difficult for online students without a solid academic background and since students dont tend to see these courses to completion completion rates for MOOCs are low PERIOD Researchers noted that MOOCs have in fact frustrated educators by giving them the ability to watch their online students fail PERIOD

We see people struggling and there really isnt any mechanism to help them Mitchell said PERIOD

However there is data on what activities students are doing in the classes and what approaches are working PERIOD Researchers are able to learn what kind of video styles are effective what grabs students attention and where students are stumbling PERIOD

I think thats what the technology is really valuable for said Candace Thille assistant professor at the Graduate School of Education PERIOD

The data demonstrates that most of the activities students do in MOOCs are either too passive  such as just watching a video  or too simple  such as answering multiple choice questions  to be effective PERIOD

To combat this Thille is working with Stanford psychology professor Carol Dwecks research group Project for Education Research That Scales PERTS to embed psychological interventions into the online classes that would reengage the disengaged students through encouragement and reassurance that he or she belongs in the class and can do well PERIOD

And despite results thus far researchers still have hope for MOOCs potential PERIOD

Im not disappointed at all with MOOCs said Mitchell Stevens vice provost for teaching and learning and associate professor of education PERIOD Were still in the horseandbuggy stage PERIOD The boundaries are blurring between online and facetoface. were looking at a future of lifelong education online he added PERIOD Much of that will come at little or no cost to learners PERIOD How can that be a bad thing
