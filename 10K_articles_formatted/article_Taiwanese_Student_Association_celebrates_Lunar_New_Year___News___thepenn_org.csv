The Taiwanese Student Association celebrated the Lunar New Year Saturday with a Taiwanese SinTshun New Year Celebration in the Hadley Union Buildings Delaware Room at Indiana University of Pennsylvania PERIOD

Taiwan along with other countries such as China Vietnam and Korea all celebrate the Lunar New Year with their own customs and traditions unique to their culture PERIOD However some similarities exist between the celebrations PERIOD

ChiaYen Lin graduate political science vice president of the Taiwanese Student Association explained some of the cultural significance of the festival for the people of Taiwan PERIOD

The term SinTshun means new spring Lin said PERIOD It includes the cultural meaning of Taiwanese PERIOD Spring is a valuable season that is not just abeginningof a calendar year but astartingpoint of everyones mind PERIOD

In theTaiwaneselanguage Lin said the meaning of the pronunciationTshun is the samewiththe saying savingsome for the future and it has been usedbyour older generationsforteaching us to cherish food money and the relationship with others. on Saturday TSA held a New Year celebration in order to give Taiwanese students a chance to celebrate an important part of their culture while they were away from home and could not celebrate with their families PERIOD

The night started off with a dinner that consisted of traditional Taiwanese dishes that were cooked by members of TSA PERIOD

The various meals served foods such as dumplings cordial shrimp sesame oil chicken and Taiwanese sausage which are all dishes that families have as part of their family gatherings PERIOD

After dinner students decorated red envelopes with goats and sheep PERIOD The envelopes are traditionally given by older family members to the young PERIOD The envelopes symbolize good luck and are supposed to ward off evil spirits PERIOD

Everyone also wrote down what they were thankful for in the past year and their wishes for  PERIOD

These were shared among the group and envelopes were exchanged with each other PERIOD

Next participants put their wishes in their new envelopes PERIOD They will keep them closed for the next year only to open them on the next Lunar New Year when they see if their wishes come true PERIOD
