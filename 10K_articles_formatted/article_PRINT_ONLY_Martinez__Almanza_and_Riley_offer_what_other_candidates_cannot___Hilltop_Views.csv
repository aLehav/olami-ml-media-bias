Every week the editorial board reflects on a current issue in Our View PERIOD The position taken does not reflect the opinions of everyone on the Hilltop Views staff PERIOD

This week the editorial staff is endorsing candidates for mayor and city council members for Districts three and nine PERIOD Early voting opened up Oct PERIOD  and will end Oct PERIOD  PERIOD Election day is Nov PERIOD  PERIOD We encourage all students to vote PERIOD

Mayor

Mike Martinez is the best candidate running to be the mayor of Austin PERIOD

Martinezs stances on issues like the environment affordable housing and economic equality demonstrate his competence to improve Austins community PERIOD

If you look at my policy record it reflects ensuring that the policy decisions we make encompass everyone in our community Martinez said in a Hilltop Views interview PERIOD

As an Austin City Council Member since  Martinez has a history of supporting city activity that ultimately benefits all Austinites PERIOD

In the past Martinez has promoted diverse culture in Austin sought to improve Austinites qualities of life and worked to improve conditions for the working class according to his biography on Austintexas.gov PERIOD

I would like to continue my service to the citizens and continue to be the strongest champion for workingclass families that I have been my entire time in city council office Martinez said in a Hilltop Views interview when asked why he is running for mayor PERIOD

In regard to student issues like employment after graduation Martinez addressed the growing population of Austin causing a competition for jobs PERIOD

One hundred and fifty people every single day move to Austin What we have to do as a mayor and council is make sure that we can handle that growth that the economy stays strong and that we continue having the jobs that are necessary Martinez said in a Hilltop Views interview PERIOD

If elected Martinez will refocus Austins economic programs to support small and local businesses which make up a large percent of Austins workforce according to Martinezs campaign site PERIOD To do this Martinez will provide training and funding assistance and will cut bureaucratic red tape PERIOD

Martinez also plans to work toward a more affordable life in the city PERIOD

We need to ensure that when our citizens are facing financial challenges at home City Hall shares those challenges and is focused on keeping city services lean efficient and productive Martinezs campaign site reads PERIOD

District 

The most competent candidate for Austin City Council District  the district in which St PERIOD Edwards University is located is Susana Almanza PERIOD

Almanza promises to address some of Austins most pressing issues like the negative effects of the citys wild population growth inadequate public education a lack of jobs for college students the hindered accessibility to public transportation and a minimum wage that doesnt provide for a good quality of life PERIOD

If elected Almanza will fight for affordable housing through rehabilitation new construction tax exemptions and expanded opportunities for home ownership according to her campaign website PERIOD

Furthermore she will work to improve the quality and safety of affordable housing two aspects that are often overlooked when drafting solutions to Austins lack of housing PERIOD

As for education Almanza promotes close partnerships between the city and local schools a necessary relationship for the improvement of public schools PERIOD She emphasizes the importance of tutoring homework assistance and funding for early childhood education PERIOD

Beyond education for younger students Almanza plans to aid college students as well PERIOD

College students need jobs and funds to pay their debts Almanzasaidin Hilltop Views last week PERIOD I will work for the creation of a Citywide Youth EmploymentInternship Office to provide outreach for employment opportunities. in response to limited access to public transportation Almanza plans to fight for improvements to roadways pedestrian pathways traffic signals sidewalks and sheltered bus stops according to her campaign site PERIOD

She also wants to secure affordable transit prices which will benefit all Austin residents some of who may not be able to afford high transportation costs because they earn low wages PERIOD

Almanzas campaign website also outlines her plans to raise the minimum wage to  per hour which will improve the workingclass Austinites quality of life PERIOD

Each of Almanzas proposed plans for Austin will benefit district  tremendously PERIOD

They are unique because they do not directly support any one party PERIOD Instead her stances suggest that Austin needs to undergo major changes regardless of party lines PERIOD

Almanza who is nonpartisan plans to improve the city for the sake of its residents not so that a certain party will benefit PERIOD

Thus voters can rest assured that by voting for Almanza they are not supporting a partys selfish battle for political power PERIOD Instead they are addressing the concerns of Austin residents which is the city councils purpose PERIOD

District 

From the aged Snowden case to the newer attacks on the lack of video of Supreme Court cases transparency has been an issue for the government PERIOD That is why Chris Riley of Austins District  should be elected PERIOD

Many St PERIOD Edwards students live in District  Rileys leadership will benefit them in many ways including making Austins government more transparent PERIOD

Riley does have plans for making the government more reliable and relatable but his website has already made him transparent PERIOD It takes two clicks to discover the dominant reason for voting for someone their stances on issues PERIOD Two clicks gets a person to the issue what Chris Riley believes what he has done for the issue on the Austin City Council and what he will do if reelected PERIOD There is no fancy language and no beating around a bush PERIOD Riley can be blunt because he practices his ideals PERIOD

One instance is Rileys stance on transportation PERIOD Austin is Americas fastest growing city according to Forbes PERIOD People need to get places and cars are no longer the fastest way to make that happen PERIOD Riley understands this and has put transportation reform and infrastructure improvements on his 10point platform for reelection PERIOD

How can you know hes sincere about something that sounds too good to be true

Riley bikes to work and does not own a car so alternative transportation benefits him as much as you PERIOD He has previously tried to persuade members of the Austin City Council to consider adding more bike lanes and bikefriendly policies according to the Austin American Statesman PERIOD He was even endorsed by Bike Austin according to his campaign PERIOD

Chris Riley for District Council  a positive progressive leader Rileys campaign slogan says PERIOD

Austin is a growing city with growing needs PERIOD Progressivism is not a cure but it is a hope to work on those needs PERIOD Chris Rileys hope is to grow Austin into a stable and economically bustling place without weeding out less wealthy homeowners PERIOD
