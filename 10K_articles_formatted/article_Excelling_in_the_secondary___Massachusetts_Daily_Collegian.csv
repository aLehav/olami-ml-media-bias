At the beginning of the  season cornerback Courtney Robinson did not start on defense for the Massachusetts football team PERIOD And yet he still found a way to make a big play returning a kickoff  yards for a touchdown in the seasonopener against Holy Cross PERIOD

Seven weeks into the regular season Robinson has taken over the starting cornerback role opposite Sean Smalls and his big play tendencies have not left him PERIOD

The 6foot 195pound junior worked his way up the depth chart this year and his development is evident in the results hes produced PERIOD

Robinson has  tackles on the season including two for a loss two pass deflections and a forced fumbled PERIOD

He is also tied with three other players in the Colonial Athletic Association with a leaguehigh three interceptions including his latest against Northeastern Saturday in a  victory PERIOD

I thought he played his best game on Saturday UMass coach Don Brown said PERIOD He had the big interception PERIOD He was all over the field hustling making plays in the running game PERIOD I just think hes getting better every week PERIOD Youve got to be happy with the way hes playing. on the second play of the fourth quarter Huskies backup quarterback John Sperrazza sold a play action fake on fourthandone from the UMass 34yard line and everyone but Robinson seemed to bite on it PERIOD

Sperrazza released a deep ball towards the UMass end zone but overthrew his intended receiver PERIOD Robinson was in perfect position to make a play PERIOD As the ball sailed over everyone Robinson stayed with it and made great catch over his shoulder with his back to the quarterback PERIOD

Robinson caught the pass at the sevenyard line running back turned made a few people miss and worked his way to the  giving the Minutemen much better field position PERIOD The catch itself resembled a center fielder going back for a deep drive PERIOD

Well baseball is my favorite sport so I guess that would play a role Robinson said PERIOD I pretty much just saw the ball in the air and knew I had to make a play on it. the Delray Beach Fla. native had two picks in backtoback games earlier in the year against Colgate and Towson but had not gotten one since PERIOD

I told coach Brown before the game that it had been a while since my last interception so I just saw a chance to make a play and I went to make a play on the ball. brown felt the play was crucial to putting the game away and getting the win over the Huskies PERIOD

What a major play PERIOD Ill tell you  that is not an easy play Brown said of the pick PERIOD Sperrazza was going for the gusto PERIOD It was fourthandshort he sold the play action to Maurice Murray and tried to sneak the receiver out PERIOD And Courtney just stayed on his key and thats all you can really ask. brown has called similar plays for the UMass offense and for the most part quarterback Liam Coen has found the receiver wide open PERIOD Courtney must have seen the play too many times in practice because on Saturday he wasnt fooled PERIOD

A lot of guys would get lost on that play but a credit to Courtney Brown said PERIOD Not only does he stay over the top he goes and gets the ball. brandon Freeman started the year as the teams second starting cornerback but since the game at Boston College Robinson has been the man on the right side of the field PERIOD

I think Robinson has gotten better and better and better and now that hes playing fulltime hes certainly a lot more comfortable with what he has to do Brown said PERIOD I think if you put him and Sean Smalls together thats a pretty good tandem. jeremy Rice can be reached at emailprotected PERIOD
