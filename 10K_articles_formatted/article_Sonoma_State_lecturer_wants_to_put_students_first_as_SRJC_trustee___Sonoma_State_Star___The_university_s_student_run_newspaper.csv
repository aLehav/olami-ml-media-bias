9358,2016-10-24,"with dyed blue hair a bright smile and a Wonder Woman water bottle Mariana Martinez provides a casually welcoming vibe for Sonoma State University students PERIOD As it turns out the Chicano and Latino studies lecturer dedicates her oncampus work to the academic and personal achievements of all students  especially those who are underrepresented. at the end of the day we need to think about the fact that we need all of these students with some form of higher education said Martinez PERIOD

Martinez  is the research coordinator for the McNair Scholars Program a federally funded oncampus program that helps  Sonoma State students per year get accepted into graduate schools to achieve masters degrees or Ph.D.s PERIOD Between this and her work as an adjunct Chicano and Latino studies professor she serves Sonoma State students on a regular basis PERIOD

But as the fall  election approaches Martinez is setting her sights toward students farther out in Sonoma County PERIOD The destination is Santa Rosa Junior College as Martinez is running to become a trustee in the  District PERIOD If elected shell oversee the schools policies and budget while representing Rohnert Park Cotati and Santa Rosa PERIOD

Martinez said she would focus on the issues of affordable student housing fulltime student enrollment and transportation if elected as trustee PERIOD She hopes to represent the changing demographics of Santa Rosa Junior College whose needs may vary from those of Sonoma State students PERIOD

Most students who go into a fouryear college are more likely to graduate because theres steps there said Martinez PERIOD With the community colleges theres such a diverse need that you dont know what to address first. according to Martinez the diverse needs at Santa Rosa Junior College may include returning students those trying to achieve a vocational certificate or AA degree or students who are trying to learn English PERIOD

She is no stranger to students from diverse backgrounds including firstgeneration students who are the first in their immediate families to attend college PERIOD Along with lowincome students of any ethnicity these students are among those Martinez works with through the McNair Scholars Program PERIOD

Daniel Smith director of the McNair Scholars Program said that Martinez works hard to help the programs students succeed PERIOD

Its really obvious that she has an exceptional level of passion for supporting and promoting the education of underrepresented students said Smith PERIOD Shes also been exceptional at  working toward equity for Latino and Latina students in particular. martinez was born in Mexico before becoming a U.S PERIOD citizen in November  and learning both speaking and academic English she said PERIOD She was one of the few students of color in most of her schooling experience.Martinez said that as a trustee she would aim to establish policies that transcend students race and social class PERIOD

Its not just my racial diversity but its the fact that as of May I was still a student working toward a Ph.D PERIOD in education policy organization and leadership from University of Illinois said Martinez PERIOD So I definitely think in terms of a poor student mentality. smith said he thinks Martinez working with students in the McNair Scholars Program helps her to better understand the challenges they face PERIOD

I think she approaches things from a social justice framework said Smith PERIOD

Donald Williams a former Sonoma State student whos currently working toward a Ph.D PERIOD in animal behavior at UC Davis was part of the McNair Scholars Program from fall  to spring  under Martinez PERIOD He said that she formed a social support network for underrepresented and firstgeneration students through the program PERIOD

She would always make time for all of her students said Williams PERIOD

Williams a firstgeneration college student who went to Santa Rosa Junior College before attending Sonoma State said Martinez could help Latino and Latina students among others at the junior college by being present on the Board of Trustees to voice their concerns. what she does is absolutely critical for developing underrepresented students in academia said Williams PERIOD

Martinez said she anticipates that if she becomes trustee there will be a trickle effect of Latina women and other underrepresented demographics receiving more opportunities in Sonoma County PERIOD

Its a huge deal when you think about higher education in the county and the country theres more women than men yet we hold very few positions of power or high levels said Martinez PERIOD

Beyond potential service at Santa Rosa Junior College Martinez said her goal is to become president of a 2year or 4year college institution someday PERIOD

To earn a seat in the Nov PERIOD  election Martinez would need to defeat at least two incumbants  PERIOD
