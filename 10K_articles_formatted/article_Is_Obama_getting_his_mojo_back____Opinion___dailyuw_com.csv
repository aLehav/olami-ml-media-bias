Updated November     pm



A political earthquake rattled Washington D.C. a couple of weeks ago PERIOD

Scott Brown who was an unheardof Republican state senator from Massachusetts defeated his Democratic rival to capture Ted Kennedys Senate seat in the most liberal state in the United States PERIOD

Pretty impressive PERIOD

TV pundits used the occasion to declare the death of President Obamas legislative agenda PERIOD Many on the right concluded that Browns victory was due to an overwhelming rejection of Obamas liberal  ideology among independent voters PERIOD

Now that the dust has settled those assessments continue to appear further and further from reality PERIOD Massachusetts proved that voters are angry but not for the reasons you might think PERIOD

Several liberal groups commissioned a poll after the election with the goal of figuring out why so many former Obama voters jumped ship and cast their ballots for Brown PERIOD By the conventional wisdom we should expect these ObamaBrown voters to be weary of the rapid pace of change since the  election PERIOD

In fact the poll showed that  percent of those ObamaBrown voters feel that the president and Democrats are not delivering enough on the changes they promised during the last campaign PERIOD

In other words they voted for Brown not because they are afraid of change but because Democrats arent doing a good job delivering it PERIOD

By conventional wisdom we should also expect these voters to fear Obamas  of health care PERIOD Alas among those who oppose the health reform bill only  percent said the bill  On the other hand  percent oppose the bill because it  A full  percent support the governmentrun public option PERIOD

In other words only a tiny fraction of ObamaBrown voters oppose the Democratic health plan because its too much too fast more oppose it because its too little too slow PERIOD

Many commentators have suggested that the only way Obama can win back these moderate voters is to move to the center and stop governing as a liberal PERIOD

The Massachusetts experience suggests otherwise PERIOD Fiftythree percent of ObamaBrown voters said they would be more likely to vote for Democrats in  if the party enacts tough new policies that crack down on Wall Street PERIOD

It appears that the White House may have gotten the message PERIOD

In his State of the Union address last week President Obama took the first steps to getting his mojo back PERIOD He proposed a new tax on several major banks to recover the remaining bailout money as well as new financial rules to prevent the reckless practices that helped cause the recession PERIOD As the president scolded Wall Street and proposed a new jobs bill in front of the entire nation Democratic senators and representatives rose to cheer while Republicans silently sat in their chairs PERIOD

Since the speech Obama has seen a jump in his approval rating amounting to  according to Rasmussen Reports PERIOD

The midterm elections are coming up this November and pollsters are predicting a Republican comeback PERIOD While Democrats should be worried they certainly have time to turn things around by passing health reform focusing on the economy and holding Wall Street accountable for the mess that they created PERIOD

It seems that Massachusetts might have been just the wakeup call that the White House needed PERIOD
