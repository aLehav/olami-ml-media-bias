2243,2022-03-16,"for a genre that was originally conceived by Brian Eno as a sort of aural counterpoint to furniture ambient music has ironically blossomed into an immersive form with greater capacity to engage the listener than all manners of inyourface rock or electronic bands PERIOD The catch of course is its dependence upon an attentive listener a solitary diver willing to explore its sonic depths PERIOD

For these very reasons Sandro Perris second widerelease album recorded under the name Polmo Polpo can pass by with nary an impression other than one of enveloping warmth PERIOD I wont preach about how you really have to sit and listen to Like Hearts Swelling on huge headphones that cover your entire skull like mine although this really is a viable way to experience the album PERIOD From the spacy slide guitar to the deep cello drone of Farewell this is pleasantly somnambulant music meant to buoy the listener up on clouds of reverb PERIOD Feel free to float PERIOD

An even more thrilling way to engage the album is to try to hear every layer of every song and to realize that on tracks like Sky Histoire cello tambourine slide guitar acoustic guitar congas bells alto saxophone and a deep electronic bass all contribute to the fluid motion implied by the song PERIOD At that point the song really opens up and admits its as dizzyingly beautiful as you first thought PERIOD
