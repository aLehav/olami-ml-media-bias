Will Burgess makes  for his term as Student Government Association president PERIOD

Will Burgess is the Student Government Association president for the  to  school year PERIOD He ran last year on theigniteUGA platform PERIOD After he graduates Burgess plans to attend law school PERIOD The Red  Black sat down with him and asked five questions about his position as president PERIOD

What made you want to be in a leadership position

I have been involved with SGA since my sophomore year PERIOD It was a great opportunity to give back and I wanted to make sure the place was left better than when I came in as a freshman PERIOD It was a good way to get involved with campus and to learn more about UGA and to have an impact that can be felt in the coming years PERIOD

What have you done to get into the position you are in

It was a lot of just learning the ins and outs of the University PERIOD We ran together with two of my good friends starting back in the fall semester last year so it was a great process getting to know a lot of different people during the campaign PERIOD That has translated to getting to know a lot of the administrators PERIOD They are all in the business because they love serving students PERIOD We get to learn how to make the University a better place for students PERIOD

What are your goals as SGA president

We are talking about a legacy and the real opportunity for that is the presidential search PERIOD We are taking a lot of time and effort to make sure we have a studentcentered president PERIOD We want student opinions to be on the table for the search PERIOD

Have you had any major successes you are especially proud of

I think probably my most proud moment in SGA has been our sophomore year PERIOD We had an election that was unopposed PERIOD There wasnt much student interest and about  percent voter turnout so we had to really fix something and figure out how to get more students involved PERIOD The senate developed a new election system to help get people involved PERIOD It was previously very hard to get involved in SGA from the outside so we broke it down and said executives and senate had to run separately which really made it more accessible.We really opened up SGA to more people PERIOD This past year was the first year under the new election system and we had four executive tickets which was a record in recent memory PERIOD

What advice would you give students who want to be in a similar position

Dont spread yourself too thin because at the end of the day you are also a student PERIOD I learned that the hard way PERIOD At the end of the day make sure you are able to be a student first PERIOD Focus on one thing and try to do it well.If you are spread too thin no organization will get the best of you PERIOD If you find a passion stick with it and really give  percent PERIOD
