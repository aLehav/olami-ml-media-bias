This past May I was lucky enough to embark on my second European adventure in as many years PERIOD It was a 12day program through Gannon and EF Tours that took us to London Paris Florence and Rome PERIOD

The trip itself was wonderful PERIOD I wont waste any of my valuable word count gushing about how Paris was everything Ive always dreamed it would be or about how sobering it was to actually stand in the Colloseum PERIOD

Those are all things that one should probably expect or at least hope for when traveling to Europe PERIOD

What I didnt expect or hope for was the disturbing human behavior I witnessed at certain tourist hotspots PERIOD When youre dealing with places like Versailles Vatican City and the Sistine Chapel there will undoubtedly be a heavy flow of tourists eager to check the location off of their bucket lists PERIOD I assumed clearly erroneously and maybe naively so that people who make the active effort to visit these historical sites must certainly have respect for them PERIOD

Sadly this isnt always the case PERIOD

I can handle the crowds PERIOD Everyone should have equal opportunity to set foot in these places PERIOD However when you allow hundreds of people into a confined space at a certain point civilized behavior tapers off and groupthink begins to emerge in its stead PERIOD Despite the fact that museums and historical landmarks typically have some set of rules for admittance these rules end up becoming more of a laundry list of suggestions PERIOD

It becomes impossible to enforce most of them simply based on the sheer amount of bodies endeavoring to subvert them PERIOD

In the Sistine Chapel for example there are several rules that are repeated before entering the nave PERIOD Theyre repeated continuously and in numerous different languages PERIOD No talking and no photos PERIOD For the five   or more minutes you choose to stay in the Chapel a sacred historical space youre expected to follow those two simple rules PERIOD

As soon as I broke out of the entranceway beyond anxious to set eyes on the famed ceiling I felt constricted PERIOD People were not only innocently milling around but pushing and shoving to release themselves from other people who were also pushing and shoving PERIOD As if this wasnt irritating enough there was an everpresent buzzing of people some whispering and others not even bothering to try PERIOD

If they couldnt understand the multilingual warnings being played over the speaker before entering they should have been able to understand the universal Shh of the security guards who really did little else to enforce the rule PERIOD

But in all fairness theres no way they could have controlled that many people crammed into a space that was not intended to hold them all PERIOD There should be absolutely no parallels drawn between the atmosphere in a museum and a mosh pit but alas I saw some that day PERIOD

It was nowhere close to ruining my experience rather it made me further appreciate these amazing places that have so many stories to tell PERIOD

But as I made my way into the next part of the tour St PERIOD Peters Basilica home to Michelangelos Pieta I became even more fearful for the future of some of these places as I stared through the sculptures plexiglass and recalled its reason for being there  a man who simply walked into the church and took a hammer to the famed marble PERIOD
