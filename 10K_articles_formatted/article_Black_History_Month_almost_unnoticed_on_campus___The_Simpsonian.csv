February has been celebrated as Black History Month since  but at Simpson it seems like such a celebration is almost nonexistent PERIOD

Out of all the schools Ive taught at Simpson engages in Black History Month the least said Nick Proctor associate professor of history PERIOD

Sophomore Dusty Thomas agrees with Proctor in his concern that not enough students are paying attention to the significance of the month PERIOD

Because were a significantly white campus it wouldnt be a bad thing to learn more about minorities Thomas said PERIOD But most people dont view it as an issue here at Simpson. on the other hand there are some who think Simpson is making a sincere effort to celebrate this important month PERIOD

Here at Simpson Black History Month serves as a reminder to celebrate diversity and the accomplishments of African Americans said Walter Lain dean of multicultural and international affairs PERIOD We want to bring a mix of programming and introduce this society to different cultural events. the Multicultural Student Alliance and the International Student Organization has been working with Lain in order to plan the activities for this tradition PERIOD

On Feb PERIOD  the celebration started with a salute to the African American society with a poster display in Brenton Student Center about various visions dreams and the history of black culture PERIOD

Yesterday there was a Soul Food Sampler in BSC that included samples of African American foods based on current black cultures around the United States PERIOD On Feb PERIOD  the movie February One will be played in a location to be later confirmed PERIOD This film discusses the lives of many historical figures who have attempted to promote black rights in the United States PERIOD

On Feb PERIOD  there will be a dance held in BSC PERIOD Although it hasnt been confirmed yet Lain and the two organizations are working to bring a Des Moines hiphop group The Spiders to Simpson PERIOD

Once things are planned students will become more involved sophomore Emmanuel MateKodjo said PERIOD What should we expect people walking around with posters and Tshirts

Something that MateKodjo would like to see at Simpson is the HipHop Summit held at Central College PERIOD This is an annual event where various dance and hiphop groups come together and perform along with main stage speakers PERIOD

I went there last year to promote the New Voters Project and the place was so packed I had to have somebody from inside escort me around MateKodjo said PERIOD It was awesome. multimedia Journalism Professor Lisa Carponelli is adding a new job to her weekly todo list the Saturday evening anchor at WHO  PERIOD This marks..
