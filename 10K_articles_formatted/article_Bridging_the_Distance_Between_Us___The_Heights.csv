3733,2017-10-22,"being in college when youre an international student can be a taxing process for many reasons PERIOD Language barriers varying weather patterns and different foods can all pose challenges PERIOD

One of the most prevalent problems though is distance PERIOD Going back home when you have to take long and expensive plane rides is a hassle PERIOD Communicating with our families can be hard if the time zones are different PERIOD Although these are hard barriers to overcome for students I think growing accustomed to a more independent American lifestyle is even harder for our parents PERIOD

I was sitting in class the other day with my laptop open and my phone in my vest pocket trying not to fidget PERIOD All of a sudden my pocket starts buzzing PERIOD I slid out the edge of my phone and saw my mothers name on the screen PERIOD I silenced the call and told myself Id call her back in  minutes after class was over PERIOD This process was repeated  more times my anxiety mounting with every call I silenced PERIOD I started thinking maybe something was wrong and I really should be answering PERIOD By that point though my teacher had not noticed the people around me had begun to look at me PERIOD I could not silence my phone fast enough PERIOD

After the twelfth call there were a couple of minutes of nothing PERIOD I thought maybe the ordeal was over PERIOD Then my laptop started beeping very loudly and a message popped up on the screen PERIOD

Catalina Murillo has found your Mac. in the next two seconds my phone started going off wildly with the message

Catalina Murillo has found your iPhone. the class was laughing as I turned a very entertaining shade of red and dismissed the alerts as fast as I could PERIOD Even my teacher let out a chuckle when after asking who was so insistent on contacting me found out it was my mother PERIOD I stepped out of the room calling my mom worriedly PERIOD She picked up the phone on the first ring PERIOD

Hi Monkey I knew youd pick up if I spammed you PERIOD How are you she said PERIOD

I groaned PERIOD She just wanted to talk and had forgotten that I had class at that time PERIOD

When I tell my friends at Boston College about this story they laugh and ask if it doesnt get annoying for me to talk to my parents once a day PERIOD I correct them and tell them that I dont talk to them once a dayits actually at least three times PERIOD

To some this may seem excessive PERIOD Ive tried telling my parents that my friends parents only call them once a week PERIOD Whenever I do this though their voices drop an octave and I know I am treading on eggshells PERIOD A wrong step and I may be on the next plane to Mexico so that they can happily talk to me every day without fail PERIOD Or depending on what theyre in the mood for on a plane to some far off monastery in Nepal so that I can learn to appreciate the constant communication PERIOD

Another tool my mom loves to use is Find My Friends which sends her my phones GPS location whenever she accesses the app PERIOD Ive had some interesting experiences with this app such as when it notified my parents that I was in the middle of the Charles River PERIOD

First they sent me pictures of my location and the messages Whatre you doing in the river accompanied by lots of little emojis of water waves and a variety of different facial expressions PERIOD When I didnt respond in the next five minutes they called me frantically asking Did you fall off the kayak Have you drowned

I proceeded to inform them that it was midnight and no I had not been on a kayak and no I had not drowned PERIOD They calmed down quickly after they realized I had actually been asleep in my bed in  and my location had been a glitch PERIOD

Its not that I think one style of maintaining relationships is better than another PERIOD I think there are simply many different ways of living and different habits that we are accustomed to PERIOD

For many international students including Mexicans college in their hometowns would have meant commuting back and forth and interacting with their families every night PERIOD Even when were in the U.S. our parents still expect us to keep the same sort of rapport we wouldve had had we not gone to college so far away PERIOD

At home every day would have been Parents Weekend and my parents plan to keep this sort of relationship even when Im not in Mexico PERIOD My mom may not have come up a couple of weeks ago but she still knows what I ate what I did where I went and how much I slept during those three days PERIOD

Theyre always the first to like my pictures on Facebook theyve opened a Snapchat account so they can draw on pictures of my dogs and encourage me to send them selfies and are always very perplexed as to why I dont live stream on Instagram PERIOD

Though Ive worked out how to keep them updated on those three social media fronts theyve also sent me a GoPro and suggested I wear it on my head PERIOD Im still figuring out how to break it to them that I will not be doing that PERIOD
