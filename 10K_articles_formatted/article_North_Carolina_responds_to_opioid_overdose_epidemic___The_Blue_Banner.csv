From  to  more than  North Carolinians have died due to opioid overdose PERIOD That is approximately three times the student population of UNC Asheville PERIOD Over the last  years more than  people have died annually devastating families and communities PERIOD 
We think this is the number one public health crisis in North Carolina said Randall Williams the N.C PERIOD Department of Health and Human Services deputy secretary of health services PERIOD I dont think we can overstate the enormity of the issue. the number of opioidrelated deaths is increasing each year PERIOD According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services fatal opioid overdose increased  percent between  and  alone PERIOD In response Gov PERIOD Roy Cooper announced North Carolinas Opioid Action Plan intended to fight opiate abuse and death PERIOD 
North Carolina is losing lives to opioids an addiction that ravages physical and mental health hurts families and communities and holds back our economy Cooper said at the Opioid Misuse and Prevention Summit PERIOD This plan gives us a path to reduce these deaths and turn the tide on this crisis. the Opioid Action Plan was announced at the Opioid Misuse and Prevention Summit in Raleigh last June PERIOD The plan outlines strategies to reduce the oversupply and diversion of prescription opioids as well as the flow of illegal drugs into communities PERIOD The plan also calls for an increase in community awareness making life saving drugs like naloxone easily available and the expansion of treatment and recovery systems PERIOD 
 We have a lot of work to do said Mandy Cohen M.D department of health and human services secretary PERIOD The opioid crisis is a devastating and complex issue that requires multi faceted collaborative action across the health law enforcement education business nonprofit and government sectors. in an interview with PBS Cooper addressed a necessity outlined in the plan the reeducation of healthcare providers throughout NC PERIOD Cooper said the introduction of opioids to many users came from doctors prescribing painkillers without taking into consideration the highly addictive qualities of these pills PERIOD
Its pretty clear to me that we arent up to speed yet across the country with educating all medical providers as to the problem and the steps that they need to take in order to prevent people from getting addicted to opioids Cooper said PERIOD Theres a lot we can do in that arena. donnie Varnell a special agent incharge with the North Carolina Department of Justice works across the state with law enforcement to change the perception of users from criminals who should be arrested to people who need help PERIOD This shift has led some officers to change their course of action from making an arrest to transferring a drug user to a treatment clinic PERIOD
We have a law enforcementassisted diversion program here in North Carolina where law enforcement is actually asking for these treatment centers Cooper said PERIOD They know that they cant keep arresting people them overdosing sending them to emergency rooms getting back out arrested again PERIOD Thats a vicious cycle thats not working. medicine for opioid overdose has been made more accessible in the state since former Governor Pat McCrory signed two pieces of legislation intended to help battle the epidemic PERIOD In  McCrory signed the Good Samaritan Law permitting law enforcement to carry and administer naloxone a lifesaving drug that reverses the effects of overdose in victims PERIOD The Good Samaritan Law also provides immunity to individuals calling for help in the presence of an overdose PERIOD Three years later McCrory signed Senate Bill  making naloxone accessible in pharmacies to be purchased without a prescription PERIOD 
Its not so much to the people being affected by the drug because you can imagine if theyve overdosed then they cant save themselves Williams said PERIOD Its really for their loved ones and those around them their friends coworkers family PERIOD Weve heard stories of 14yearolds getting it so they can save their 18yearold brothers life if he overdoses while hes at home. the epidemic of increased opioid overdoses has been seen nationwide over the last  years PERIOD North Carolina is home to four of the top  cities in America for opioid abuse rate Wilmington Hickory Jacksonville and Fayetteville PERIOD According to the Center for Disease Control there are  prescriptions for painkillers in every  people in North Carolina PERIOD The Opioid Action the Good Samaritan Law and Senate Bill  are changing the protocols for dealing with this crisis PERIOD Alongside these changes in legislation increases in treatment education and understanding about the tragic loss of hundreds of lives daily gives North Carolina reason to hope for reversal of increasing overdoserelated deaths PERIOD
