While the month of April certainly means warmer weather is upon us it also means a whole ton of rainfall is coming too PERIOD

Whether youre walking outside without an umbrella or warm and dry in your apartment rainfall can be both beautiful and dreadful. if theres one thing the past few weeks have shown us its that Chicago rainy days are here to stay this month. here are four songs to help get you through a warmweathered rainy day in the city PERIOD

 PERIOD Yellow  Coldplay

This is for one of those days where youre stuck inside looking out the window at the rainy weather outdoors while simultaneously contemplating your life and the world around you. while the songs lyrics are a reference to the bands lead singer Chris Martins unrequited love the music video accompanied with it is merely Martin walking on a beach as rainfall pours down over him. certainly not the most joyful song from Coldplay it surely adds to a rainy atmosphere PERIOD

 PERIOD Raindrops Keep Fallin on My Head  B.J PERIOD Thomas

Easily one of the catchiest songs on this list the  song written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach was originally created for the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid  for which it won an Academy Award PERIOD Recorded by B.J PERIOD Thomas the song quickly became a hit outside of the film and was actually the first American No PERIOD  hit of the 1970s. if theres a song for a happygolucky rainy day this song is your best bet PERIOD

 PERIOD Have You Ever Seen the Rain  Creedence Clearwater Revival

A good tune to accompany B.J PERIOD Thomas cheerful song Have You Ever Seen the Rain by Creedence Clearwater Revival describes a sunshower natural phenomenon when rain falls over the sun. while the sunshower description is the bands explanation for the song other fans have speculated the songs lyrics refer to the Vietnam War with the rain being a metaphor for bombs falling from the sky. while Creedence Clearwater Revival has always been known for being political this speculation has never been proven true PERIOD

 PERIOD Purple Rain  Prince and The Revolution

While Purple Rain is merely metaphorical the song by Prince and The Revolution is undoubtedly a classic that cant be missed from this list PERIOD To Prince the phrase meant When theres blood in the sky  red and blue  purple purple rain pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faithgod guide you through the purple rain. the Student News Site of DePaul University",St. Vincent's DeJamz: April showers - The DePaulia,DePaul University
