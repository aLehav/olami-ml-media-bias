The Shield

Students participate in a chant for their individual colleges during last years Welcome Week PERIOD Each college works to be the loudest as they walk into the Physical Activities Center PERIOD

Moms and dads unloading vans packed with clothes TVs and minirefrigerators faculty members guiding students around campus and an ice cream and movie night  these are just a few things to discover during this Welcome Week  PERIOD

From Aug PERIOD  to  Welcome Week leaders aspire to guide firstyear students as well as get them familiar with professors and administrators PERIOD

Students will also get a chance to explore the campus with their families and get a good handle on the location of their classes PERIOD

One of the largest events during Welcome Week is convocation PERIOD

For new students convocation is the introduction to the university Carmen Stoen director of Student Development Programs said PERIOD It is a welcoming given by the president of the university administrators and top student leaders PERIOD It is meant to encourage incoming students to get involved and take every advantage of their college experience. this formal introduction to the university will take place Friday afternoon with a  class picture being taken directly after in the Quad PERIOD

At convocation firstyear students will be introduced to the University and sophomores will be recognized for some of their achievements from last year PERIOD

Student leaders will be recognized and available to any students with questions they may have PERIOD

The Student Government Association SGA president Ashley Wright will conduct a pinning ceremony at convocation where students will receive a pin with their entry year into the institution PERIOD

Aside from the more formal welcoming sessions several interactive evening activities are scheduled throughout the week ranging from an ice cream social to hypnotist Daniel James PERIOD

What I am most excited for during Welcome Week is the hypnotist freshman Andrew Todd said PERIOD Ive talked to some people who have been to past Welcome Weeks and they say he is awesome. the evening events are designed to make new students feel more a part of their university while also bringing them together with returning students PERIOD

One of the other popular events is the college meetings accompanied by lunch with the faculty PERIOD

This gives students the opportunity to get to meet some of the faculty connected to their majors Stoen said PERIOD It also gives them the opportunity to interact with other students in their major. the meetings start at  Friday PERIOD Students will be given a free tshirt representing their college that they can wear at Convocation PERIOD

One of the required portions of the week is Eagle Experience UNIV  PERIOD Since all new students must complete the UNIV  course all incoming freshmen and transfer students must attend Eagle Experience

There will be people from campus talking about different issues Stoen said PERIOD We end it with a small group discussion with an AMIGO and youll meet some of your classmates for the first time that are in that UNIV  class. stoen said she ultimately hopes students meet two or three new people they can make a connection with someone they can grab lunch with once the semester starts PERIOD

I also hope that students feel a little more comfortable being on campus and wont be as anxious on their first day of class Stoen said and be a little more confident about their surroundings and the resources that are available to them. news
