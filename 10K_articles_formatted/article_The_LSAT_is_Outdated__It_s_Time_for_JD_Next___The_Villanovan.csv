7777,2022-01-19,"the LSAT has been a standard component of the law school admissions process for more than  years PERIOD Though the test has changed in some ways since its introduction the premise remains the same through a series of reading comprehension analytical reasoning and logical thinking questions hopeful law school applicants will attempt to prove their intelligence to a higherlevel institution PERIOD

But will they Recent debates over whether the LSAT is fair for all students across socioeconomic levels has cast increasing doubt on the validity of the exam PERIOD This coupled with the rising question of whether or not the test is an accurate measure of acuity has rendered the LSATs future role in the law school admissions process uncertain PERIOD

Created in  the LSAT was originally tailored to the students who had access to the financial and social resources required to attend graduatelevel programs PERIOD These standards have changed since  though the basis of the test itself has not PERIOD Until now PERIOD

A new law school admissions test JDNext is an innovative and equitable alternative to the traditional LSAT avenue PERIOD The test was founded at the University of Arizona in  and was released this fall to its first batch of participating students PERIOD

Currently it is approved by more than  law schools including Georgetown Syracuse and Vanderbilt as a valid testing benchmark in lieu of a LSAT or GRE score PERIOD Jackie Slate a senior at Villanova and prospective law school student agrees with the notion that its time for a change in academia PERIOD

In most academic settings there are institutions and ideas that are no longer applicable to our current way of thinking Slate said PERIOD Exploring other avenues is certainly worthwhile. jDNext is a twopart program consisting of a five to tenweek online course and a threehour final exam PERIOD The course provides not only a comprehensive overview of introductory legal concepts but an analysis of several key cases PERIOD

Thus it is valid in predicting potential success in law school because the content consists of relevant course information rather than the hypothetical reasoning questions seen in the LSAT PERIOD

The final exam is based on a culmination of the curriculum of the preparatory course PERIOD The test consists of  multiple choice questions and one essay sample PERIOD Like the LSAT and GRE it takes approximately four hours to complete PERIOD

However unlike traditional tests the scores of students have statistically produced little to no score discrepancies between racial and socioeconimic demographics PERIOD

The LSAT is undoubtedly discriminatory against students of lowerincome families and minority groups PERIOD Countless expenses go into the creation of a good test score tutoring prep courses textbooks testing fees which accumulate tremendously if taken multiple times and the hours of time students spend in preparation for the exam PERIOD

JDNexts program is  including both the course and the exam PERIOD Because the preparatory class and final test are combined this fee is much less arbitrary than the countless hidden expenses that cultivate an LSAT experience PERIOD

This is more manageable for many families setting a fiscal benchmark for which all students must abide regardless of class or race PERIOD

Erin Costa another Villanova senior and law school applicant says that the process of studying for traditional tests is expensive both literally and timewise PERIOD

I studied off and on for about nine months and only in the last three months did I really start focusing on my studying Costa said PERIOD

 I feel like JDNext will help to decrease that unfairness amongst different incomes and Im really excited to see that work. most students take the LSAT the summer before their senior year or during that first semester Slate said PERIOD Study time before then varies but it definitely can be a yearlong process. standardized testing does not paint an accurate picture as to a students work ethic wellroundedness or intelligence especially those lacking the resources to fully prepare PERIOD

However it does provide an easy way for schools to categorize students instantly PERIOD This quality alone adds a layer of practicality to the admissions process that cant simply be foregone PERIOD

Its hard to put into words how I feel about the LSAT Costa said PERIOD On one hand I hate standardized testing because its crazy expensive and it instigates this whole culture of I need to get the best score otherwise I cant get in. on the other hand Im not sure how else schools can differentiate two similar students. without completely erasing the standardized element to law school testing JDNext and similar programs are a step in the right direction towards a more equitable admissions process PERIOD

By painting testtaking abilities in front of a fairer contextual backdrop it more accurately judges a students readiness for graduate academia PERIOD

Only time will tell if the program will withstand the competitive and rigid culture of law school admissions but as of now its validity and impartiality speaks for itself PERIOD
