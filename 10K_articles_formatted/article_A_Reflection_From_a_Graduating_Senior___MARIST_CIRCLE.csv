9674,2021-05-30,"graduation is rapidly approaching for the class of  PERIOD Amidst the chaos of capping projects and COVID19 regulations lies the bittersweet reality of moving on to the next chapter of life. i still remember vividly the first time I stepped foot on the Marist College campus on movein day freshman year PERIOD There was something about it the sun shining through the trees the camaraderie between students the beauty of the Hudson River and the brilliance of the architecture all working in harmony to create an enchanting atmosphere PERIOD Its clear that this sentiment is shared by most Marist students the beautiful May weather is guaranteed to bring students out in troves to sit on the campus green and soak up the intoxicating energy that Marist offers PERIOD Now Marists latest graduating class is forced to say goodbye to a place that many of us call a second home PERIOD

While there is a certain excitement in becoming a fulltime adult and enjoying the advantages that come along with it many seniors including myself share a melancholic nostalgia about our experiences at Marist PERIOD The brief fraction of a lifetime that students spend at college represents a glaring disconnect from the real world. as clich as it sounds life truly isnt the same after college PERIOD Nearly every day Ive spent at Marist over the last four years has been filled with excitement and spontaneity PERIOD Ive had minimal responsibilities  at least relative to that of an adult  all of my friends were no more than a fiveminute walk away and I truly never knew what the day would bring PERIOD

In retrospect this type of lifestyle starkly contrasts with the predictability and monotony that characterizes the schedule of working a ninetofive job PERIOD Adult life certainly yields its own set of benefits with financial independence the ability to start a family and other legal privileges to name a few PERIOD These considerations however dont make it any easier to say goodbye to the venue in which weve lived the most important and formative years of our lives PERIOD In the series finale of The Office Andy Bernard infamously quoted I wish there was a way to know youre in the good old days before youve actually left them PERIOD Personally Ive known for the past four years that I was in the good old days  but that didnt stop them from flying by PERIOD

The Class of  met an unexpected hindrance in the form of the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD Quicker than the COVID19 rapid test Marist students had to pack up their belongings and transition to the stressful world of online learning during a global pandemic PERIOD The necessity of digital education presented an entirely new subset of academic difficulties that academia was not initially equipped to handle PERIOD To make matters worse the Class of  had to adapt to online learning during their senior year a year notorious for a heavy workload and difficult assignments PERIOD Perhaps most jarring of all was the displacement from the traditional college way of life PERIOD COVID19 regulations forced students to forego traditional social activities which exacerbated the task of maintaining a social life PERIOD This was especially challenging for the class of  as senior year is traditionally the apex of many students social lives  bar crawls sporting events and formals  all of which were taken away PERIOD

Although the overarching rhetoric behind the pandemic and its effects on the college experience is negative there is something to be said about the perseverance of the Class of  under such alien circumstances PERIOD We undertook the biggest challenge of our academic careers while maintaining social responsibility to hedge the threat of the virus PERIOD While graduating college in itself is a noteworthy achievement completing senior year in the face of seemingly insurmountable roadblocks takes a tremendous amount of resolve maturity and mental strength PERIOD For this the Class of  deserves a resounding congratulations PERIOD
