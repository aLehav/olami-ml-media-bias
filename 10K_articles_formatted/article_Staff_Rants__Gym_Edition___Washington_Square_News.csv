1991,2023-11-04,"on Treadmill Vultures
By Melanie Pineda Opinion Editor

My sophomore year I would try to go to the gym at least twice a week  shocking I know PERIOD The treadmill was something I dreaded at first but ultimately ended up loving after building myself a workout routine that worked for me PERIOD Then came the woe that every student at the NYU gyms face  the people who circle the treadmills when youre clearly still running PERIOD Ill admit there were some days where I was that person theres only so many treadmills in the relatively tight spaces PERIOD But I wouldnt obnoxiously make my presence known by stretching near the treadmills or circling around them like a predator to prey PERIOD I would well work out on literally any other machine PERIOD Treadmills arent the only option and the bikes or weights or yoga matts will probably not hurt you PERIOD Please leave me to run in peace your time to run in place will come I promise PERIOD

On WeightDroppers
By Victor Porcelli News Editor

I think everyone can agree that it is not enjoyable to hear a loud slam from someone dropping large weights on the ground when youre just trying to get a morning workout in PERIOD Im already traumatized enough by my alarm bell that I snooze a minimum of four times so I dont need to hear a giant crash that makes me jump out of my skin just because someone needs everyone to look at how much weight theyre lifting If you cant slowly place the weight on the ground guess what Lower the weight PERIOD Its also dangerous potentially damaging to the floor and just rude

On the Gym Selfie
By Sarah John Deputy Opinion Editor

There is a gym selfie quota PERIOD I havent determined exactly what it is yet but believe me it exists and if you are taking daily gym selfies then you are most certainly breaking it PERIOD The gym selfie is my least favorite type of selfie PERIOD We all know what working out at the gym looks like PERIOD If you want to show off how fit you are take a scenic hiking photo please Thats a step up from a picture of you all sweaty crouching down next to gym equipment PERIOD

On Gym Etiquette and the Gym Elite
By Lauren Gruber Deputy Copy Chief

The gym is frankly disgusting PERIOD Nothing is worse than finally getting a spot in the stretching area in Palladium and seeing the mat slick with back sweat or the rope on the pulley system literally reeking of other peoples sweaty hands PERIOD Please fellow students learn proper gym etiquette and use the cleaning spray after you get butt sweat all over the hip abductor seats Sincerely a germaphobe PERIOD

Also as someone who finally convinced herself to start working out more I hate seeing how much more in shape other people at the gym are than I am PERIOD Nothing compares to the shame of seeing that the person who used the leg press before you had the weight at  pounds and youre struggling to press  PERIOD Or when I can barely see through the sweat running into my eyes and the person next to me on the elliptical is barely flushed after running for twice as long as me PERIOD If NYU could install private gyms in each dorm room to save me the embarrassment that would be great PERIOD

The Importance of Workout Music and an Uninterrupted Workout
By Guru Ramanathan Arts Editor

I dont mind social interaction at the gym but I just prefer to avoid it altogether PERIOD I just want to listen to my playlist exercise and focus on myself for a bit PERIOD And yet some people find ways to ruin all of these things in one fell swoop PERIOD Im talking about the disrespectful gym patrons who while I am in the middle of a set try to come talk to me make some weird hand motions and question me on how much longer I will be using a certain machine or set of weights PERIOD First I cant hear because music is blasting through my ears PERIOD Also I dont want to hear you because I am trying to exercise and I figured it would be pretty obvious whether or not I am done yet PERIOD Its not like theres only one machine at the gym PERIOD If something is being occupied either wait until someone is done with their set or just find something else to do PERIOD

Also I need music to work out PERIOD It feels like a crime on my body mind and soul to come to the gym without my headphones PERIOD Its as simple as that PERIOD Thus I absolutely hate it when I get to the gym without music for some reason my phone loses battery my headphones lose battery I forget my headphones who knows PERIOD Admittedly there have been times where I just immediately leave the gym if one of those things happen PERIOD Also think about the alternative have your ears flooded by your gyms poor playlist which you can barely listen to anyway because it is being overpowered by the grating sound of machines PERIOD I need music but it also needs to be my music PERIOD

On People Who Cant Wait Their Turn
By Hannah Khosravi Opinion Editor

Once when I was on the abdominal machine at the gym one set in a grown man who was standing by lurking and waiting for the machine actually walked up to me with the intention of grabbing at the bars aggressively hollered OK I think thats enough and told me it was time to get off PERIOD I was so genuinely shocked at this manifestation of intergym rage that I didnt know how to react PERIOD Sure weve all waited for an elliptical or a treadmill or a set of weights before but have we ever nearly jumped someone out of frustration I dont know if this is as much a rant as it is a public retelling of a very strange incident that one time occurred on a Sunday at the gym PERIOD But maybe it is also a PSA to chill out and wait your gosh darn turn PERIOD
