Ten months later Kelly Bertoni still remembers the conversation PERIOD

The drum major for the Michigan marching band stood at the doors of Revelli Hallthe bands rehearsal space helping thenDirector of Operations Maggie St PERIOD Clair bag up bananas and bagels and granola bars for their trip to Ohio State last Nov PERIOD  PERIOD St PERIOD Clair decked out in maize and blue turned to Bertoni PERIOD

Kelly make sure you have your breakfast too. they embraced then parted to load the buses PERIOD Bertoni didnt know that simple earlymorning conversation would be their last PERIOD She didnt know that tragedy was about to strike PERIOD And she didnt know that soon she would be sitting in that same Revelli lobby figuring out how best to honor St PERIOD Clairs memory PERIOD

St PERIOD Clair was the de facto mom of the band PERIOD She organized everything  from coordinating trips to ordering uniform accessories to securing building access PERIOD More than that she made herself available to anyone who needed her PERIOD For over  years band members knew that if something was wrong they could talk to her and she would listen PERIOD She would know PERIOD

Senior Erin Sickrey a cymbals player remembers goofing around with her friends once in Revelli when the handle of a door broke off PERIOD Worried Sickrey walked in holding the handle  and ran right into St PERIOD Clair PERIOD With her usual grace St PERIOD Clair let Sickrey know it wasnt a big deal it could be fixed PERIOD

St PERIOD Clair took the time to get to know band members even keeping in touch with alumni and asking about their families PERIOD She was always there to say hi or offer a hug PERIOD And at  it seemed like she wouldnt be stopping any time soon PERIOD

But shortly after loading the buses that November day the students realized something was wrong PERIOD In the middle of attendance they were told that there had been a medical emergency PERIOD Eventually administrators confirmed it had been St PERIOD Clair but there was little information from the hospital or her husband at first PERIOD

And after the threehour bus ride to Columbus the students got lunch then were told St PERIOD Clair had died PERIOD

That was the worst day of my life said marching band director John Pasquale one of the administrators tasked with bearing the bad news PERIOD

Shortly after the band had to go out and perform a show in front of fans of their most hated rival knowing they were in a hostile environment PERIOD Ohio State held a moment of silence for St PERIOD Clair in the Horseshoe and all things considered the fans were pretty respectful PERIOD But that couldnt possibly numb the pain in that moment PERIOD

To senior Lexi Willison a trumpet player the actual show that day was a blur PERIOD But she remembers all the other details PERIOD She too says it was one of the worst days of her life PERIOD

Being there with everybody else all of us going through the same thing helped Willison said PERIOD But nothing really could ever make up for the fact what had happened what we just experienced us still having to go out there and do our jobs. when the band traveled to Atlanta for the Peach Bowl it was clear just how much they had lost PERIOD Not only was St PERIOD Clair the emotional heartbeat of the band she was also the one who organized the logistics of a bowl trip  scouting the venue beforehand making sure everything was ready to go  and there was an element of disorganization that wasnt there before PERIOD Everyone could feel it PERIOD



In April Bertoni and the rest of the show design committee met in the lobby of Revelli PERIOD Their undertaking was in some ways normal PERIOD After all the studentrun committee meets every year brainstorming show ideas for the next season PERIOD But this time one loomed over the rest a show to honor St PERIOD Clair PERIOD

St PERIOD Clair loved Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars PERIOD The committee discussed the merits of all those shows but eventually landed on her favorite  Mary Poppins PERIOD

The student committee doesnt have the final say in what shows make the schedule PERIOD They present their ideas to Pasquale and he decides which ones to run based on target demographics difficulty and how easy it is to secure the rights among other things PERIOD Pasquale then announces the lineup at the beginning of band week  a twoweek boot camp of sorts before school starts each year PERIOD

This year during band week the members found out that not only were they doing Mary Poppins in honor of St PERIOD Clair they could go all out PERIOD

The marching band operates in show cycles based on how long they have to prepare for a given game PERIOD If there was a show the week before its a oneweek cycle  usually simpler shows that are easy to learn in less time PERIOD Because the band travels just to Michigan State Notre Dame and Ohio State the Big Ten season often operates in twoweek show cycles with an extra week to prepare when the team is away PERIOD

But this season there was a quirk in Michigans schedule  an early season bye week followed by an away game at Wisconsin then a home tilt with Rutgers PERIOD That presented a rare opportunity a threeweek show cycle PERIOD The longer the show cycle the more intricate the shows could be and a threeweek cycle  in which the band has three weeks to learn and prepare for one show  is a rare luxury PERIOD

The decision to use the Mary Poppins show for the Rutgers game was obvious PERIOD Mary Poppins will be one of the longest and most difficult shows the band has ever done and throughout rehearsals the section leaders have made it clear that a show that means so much needs to be perfect PERIOD

This is probably the most seriously people have ever taken a show Sickrey said PERIOD   In other shows you can goof off a little bit PERIOD Its more fun PERIOD But for these ones the rank leaders are very much emphasizing Theres no excuses on this show this has to be perfect because this is the reason that were doing it. theres a story Willison tells some of the new members who didnt know St PERIOD Clair or her impact on the band PERIOD

Her dad was in the marching band during his time at Michigan in the late 1980s and St PERIOD Clair was his director of operations too PERIOD Theyd stayed in touch and near  St PERIOD Clair invited the Willison family to tour Revelli during a rehearsal PERIOD St PERIOD Clair showed Lexi  a budding trumpet player in her middle school band  the trumpet lockers pictures of past sections and a mural with a visual representation of the music for The Victors. the trip played a small role in Willison coming to Michigan and when she got there St PERIOD Clair remembered her and asked about her parents and her younger siblings PERIOD

St PERIOD Clair wasnt known as the band mom for nothing PERIOD It was almost as if the St PERIOD Clair family and three decades of the Michigan marching band family were one and the same and nothing demonstrated that like St PERIOD Clair reaching out to Willisons long graduated dad and treating his entire family like it was her own PERIOD

When Willison was told of St PERIOD Clairs death she came to terms not only with what had happened but the fact that shed have to tell her dad  until she paraded into the stadium and a fellow band member pointed out that her parents were there in the audience PERIOD Theyd come down to Columbus to surprise her PERIOD When the stadium PA announced a moment of silence for St PERIOD Clair the secret was out PERIOD

After the game as the band trekked back to its buses Willison ran into her dad PERIOD They had a good cry together  two generations of marching band members touched by St PERIOD Clair and everything she did for the program PERIOD

There are different ways to drive home St PERIOD Clairs impact for those who didnt know her PERIOD Some people like Bertoni  who grew up in St PERIOD Clairs hometown of Chelsea went to the same church as her family and worked as an assistant to St PERIOD Clair for a semester  tell touching personal stories PERIOD Others only have to mention her job description PERIOD Even the freshmen realize how much goes into running a marching band and that St PERIOD Clair did a lot of the dirty work you only see once youve been inside the Revelli doors PERIOD

You think of the smallest details and thats what Maggie did Bertoni said PERIOD Ordering the ties for some of the GSIs and the scarves PERIOD She helped me get my uniform and just the dry cleaning the bills and the management PERIOD  And I think a lot of people didnt realize what that was until unfortunately with her passing trying to analyze the situation how we were going to move forward and best prepare moving forward it was like Oh Maggie was doing the job of like five people thats crazy. of course the marching band has a new director of operations now Kimberly Smith and Pasquale has taken the time to emphasize that shes not St PERIOD Clairs replacement Shes not filling in Maggies shoes shes making her own shoes as Sickrey recalls Pasquales message PERIOD

That alone is telling PERIOD Smith could do everything perfectly but it would be nearly impossible for anyone to match St PERIOD Clairs impact PERIOD



When the marching band parades out of the tunnel Saturday against the Scarlet Knights it will all mean more PERIOD Its not just that theyre performing St PERIOD Clairs favorite music or that the show is in honor of her but that some of her family will be in the stands along with countless alumni PERIOD On Sunday the marching band is hosting a celebration of life and many former members are coming back for it PERIOD The band will perform there too  both their traditional repertoire like the fight song and alma mater and selections from Mary Poppins PERIOD The whole weekend will be dedicated to remembering St PERIOD Clair and gaining closure PERIOD

Its  difficult to imagine that this happened less than a year ago in some ways so its still kind of fresh Bertoni said PERIOD And I think that that is something sometimes Im like Wow a lot has happened in that time but at the same time its still fairly recent. nobody who was there will soon forget that morning in Columbus but theres no better way to honor someone who gave her all to the Michigan marching band than putting on one of the most ambitious shows theyve ever done  and approaching it with St PERIOD Clairs enthusiasm and zeal PERIOD

When she was alive knowledge of St PERIOD Clairs impact was largely confined inside the doors of Revelli Hall PERIOD But on Saturday in front of  people the band will have an opportunity to convey a slice of who she was and what she meant to  years of marching band members PERIOD

Were all very much aware of why were doing this who were doing this for Willison said PERIOD And its an honor to be able to be one of the people who can honor her. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
