4109,2004-01-28,"santa Barbaras ecosystem may soon be a bit less toxic thanks to a new policy approved last night by the Santa Barbara City Council PERIOD

On Tuesday night the council approved the Integrated Pest Management policy PERIOD The plan added three parks to a list of pesticidefree parks bringing the total number to  of the  parks in the city of Santa Barbara PERIOD The pan also places restrictions on the use of pesticides in parks where they are allowed PERIOD

The IPM policy is modeled after a strategy used in San Francisco where pesticides are rated based on their level of risk to human health and scaled back until the minimum amount of toxins needed is used Santa Barbara Assistant Parks  Recreation Director Jeff Cope said PERIOD The Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District also has a formal organic policy that bans the use of pesticides PERIOD

The plan is the result of three years of work by the Pesticide Awareness and Alternatives Coalition PAAC and the Environmental Defense Center whose goal is to eventually end the use of harmful pesticides in the city of Santa Barbara PERIOD

In a press conference before the meeting PAAC president Nancy Black spoke to the crowd about the need to use alternative methods of weed and pest control PERIOD

From the point of view of the parks district pesticides are necessary for aesthetic reasons and to manage the squirrels but thats not the case Black said PERIOD There are alternatives available and it will take some resources to make it happen. cope who is the head of the IPM committee presented the policy to the council PERIOD Cope said the additional resources needed to implement alternative options could cost the city up to four times more than conventional pesticides PERIOD

Eric Cardenas director of the EDCs Central Coast Environmental Health Project said he hopes the council will adopt additional elements of the IPM such as a commitment to eliminating pesticides completely and the inclusion of community members on the IPM Committee PERIOD

The city of Santa Barbara is known as the birthplace of the modern environmental movement Cardenas said PERIOD With a couple of adjustments the EDC feels that this program will be one of the strongest in the region if not the state. mayor Marty Bloom said she also feels it is important for Santa Barbara to return to its leadership role in the environmental community PERIOD

We kind of fell asleep as a community after the oil spill of  when we got the Earth Day program up and running and things and were just now starting to wake up a little Bloom said PERIOD

Pedro Nava California Coastal Commissioner spoke to the council about the impact Santa Barbaras decision would have on the environmental community and on the global community in return PERIOD

It is more than heartbreaking to think that pesticides sprayed in Alameda Park make their way to Santa Barbaras creeks and then to the ocean where they become part of the worlds food chain Nava said PERIOD I dont know that we have a choice but to do all we can to eliminate the use and exposure to chemicals. cope said the public may react poorly if city parks trade in their high standards of aesthetic appearance for a more organic approach PERIOD Jonathan Southard a former member of the board of directors at Fairview Organic Farms said he thinks the council should rethink such aesthetic standards PERIOD

The council was afraid of not keeping parks up to standards but the manicured look were used to with the use of pesticides maybe isnt the look we should be trying for Southard said PERIOD

Mayor Pro Tempore Iya G PERIOD Falcone made a motion for the council to approve the IPM plan with some adjustments which were passed unanimously PERIOD The adjustments stipulate that three additional city parks be added to the list of pesticidefree parks that the council formally declare its goal to have a completely pesticidefree community and that two community members be given seats on the IMP committee PERIOD

Councilmember Brian Barnwell said he was glad to see the community support the policy and anticipates the plans initiation PERIOD

Im so happy to hear that everyone is behind this and frankly Im shocked that we havent done it sooner Barnwell said PERIOD Its time we get on the horse and ride this thing. black said she was delighted with the councils decision PERIOD

This is beyond my expectations PERIOD I didnt expect to get everything we asked for Black said PERIOD Im thrilled. print
