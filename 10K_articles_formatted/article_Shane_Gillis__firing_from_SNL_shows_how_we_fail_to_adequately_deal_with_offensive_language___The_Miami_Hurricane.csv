A few weeks ago SNL announced that it would be firing newlyhired comedian Shane Gillis after a podcast clip went viral in which Gillis mocks Chinese accents and uses an antiAsian racial slur PERIOD

Gillis has since released a statement on the matter writing I am a comedian who pushes boundaries PERIOD I sometimes miss PERIOD Im happy to apologize to anyone whos actually offended by anything Ive said. some found SNLs decision to fire Gillis commendable while others viewed it as political correctness intruding on the art of comedy PERIOD

While Gillis hurtful language and weak apology make him a difficult person to defend Gillis situation with SNL is just another example of how we fail to adequately deal with offensive language especially in comedy PERIOD

Presidential candidate Andrew Yang expressed similar views on the topic PERIOD

Yang who was one of the subjects of Gillis racial slur came out in defense of Gillis expressing his belief that Gillis should not have been fired from SNL PERIOD

Yang wrote on Twitter As a society we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful and later saying I think that he deserved another chance to keep his job. yang even reached out to Gillis about meeting to discuss why Gillis jokes were hurtful PERIOD

While Yang does not represent the entirety of the AsianAmerican community his response to Gillis antiAsian jokes offers a refreshingly nuanced approach to how we should deal with offensive language PERIOD

Giving people a second chance is not downplaying the pain that racially hurtful language can cause it is merely a recognition of the fact that we are all humans who say regrettable things PERIOD

As Yang put it Shane Gillis does not strike me as malignant or evil He strikes me as a stillforming comedian from central Pennsylvania who made some terrible and insensitive jokes and comments. for comedians determining what constitutes edgy humor and what is legitimately hurtful is often difficult PERIOD And the boundaries of what topics are acceptable to joke about are constantly changing with time PERIOD

Im not arguing that comedians should be exempt from the professional costs that come with using racial slurs PERIOD But a lot of the outrage that comes from TV shows such as SNL is over the top and disingenuous PERIOD

If we are going to be able to progress as a society there has to be some form of rehabilitation for those who have said offensive things PERIOD A sincere apology and proof of how one has changed should be enough to earn our forgiveness PERIOD

Continuing to boycott and shun those who have said stupid things will get us nowhere PERIOD When we are unable to distinguish between poor comedic taste and bigotry we diminish the evil of genuine racism PERIOD
