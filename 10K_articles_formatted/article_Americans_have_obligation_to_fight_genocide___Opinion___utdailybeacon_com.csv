Read the daily headlines of newspapers and you can see the world reduced to a series of measurements  the state of the economy the rankings of sports teams the tragic results of a terrorist attack PERIOD We watch the news and hear about the consequences of war natural disasters and political decisions PERIOD Contrarily even harder to convey in the media are the monumental moments where a major event doesnt happen PERIOD Such is the ambiguous and often unnoticed nature of prevention PERIOD

In January the people in Southern Sudan had the opportunity to vote on a referendum signifying their secession from the larger state of Sudan PERIOD Now if you have any idea where Sudan is located in Africa or have perhaps heard the term  you might comprehend the volatility of the region and the governments reputation for using violence against its own people to destroy lives PERIOD

A number of individuals across the country ranging from highlevel policymakers in Washington to students here at UT called upon our country to help ensure a diplomatic peace process surrounding the referendum and its aftermath PERIOD Actor George Clooney even appeared in the media to help draw attention to the high risk of violence that such a seemingly insignificant event could foster PERIOD The world tensely waited to see if Sudan would fall into a bloody civil war such as the one it experienced in the 1980s PERIOD

This February the referendum results announced that Southern Sudan would successfully break away from the larger nation PERIOD Concerned individuals sighed with relief and the situation seemingly faded into the past PERIOD The potential for violence held at bay many wondered what all the commotion was even about PERIOD Preventing a catastrophe hardly yields tangible results PERIOD Peacemaking rarely makes the news  war garners media attention PERIOD

In addition this month marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United States ratification of the Genocide Convention PERIOD After the Holocaust the world said never again would it allow such an atrocity yet hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives to governmentsponsored militia attacks in Darfur PERIOD Without people dedicating their time and energy to genocide prevention efforts we would certainly be bystanders to murder PERIOD Its hard to measure the number of lives saved but that hardly constitutes an excuse for inaction PERIOD

So why should we care Why does it even matter to honor the Genocide Convention Because prevention works and we have come a long way over the past  years PERIOD For instance the topic of genocide prevention is now acknowledged in election debates and is rising as a highprofile issue for sitting presidents PERIOD A strong antigenocide constituency has condemned and pressured the murderous actions of governments like that of Omar alBashir in Sudan and has worked to ensure peaceful facilitation on behalf of innocent citizens living under dangerously oppressive regimes PERIOD

Though you may wonder why it matters to help people across the world or how it relates to you we are all neighbors in this increasingly globalized world and we all deserve the right to our lives PERIOD Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel famously expressed 

As U.S PERIOD citizens we assert our nations leadership of the free world and with that position comes responsibility PERIOD We have studied the Holocaust and it would be unacceptable for future generations to hear about a horrific repeat of history when we can learn from our past move forward and take up our role as  on behalf of humanity PERIOD
