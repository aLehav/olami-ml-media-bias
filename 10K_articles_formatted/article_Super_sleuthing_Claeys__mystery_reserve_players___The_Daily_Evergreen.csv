JACKSON GARDNER Evergreen reporterAugust  

The Cougars defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys gave us a bit of a mystery to solve when he singled out five to six of his reserve players who are ready to contribute PERIOD

The offense is way ahead when it comes to our twos versus their twos Claeys said PERIOD However there are five kids probably six in that second group that can play and help us but when you put a whole second group out there without all the ones the offense is just ahead of us. when asked about whom those players in the second group were Claeys didnt give any names and said he needed to see the film first PERIOD

It is impossible to know exactly which players Claeys was referring to but its a good opportunity to put on my Sherlock Holmes hat and let the speculation commence PERIOD

Strong is one of the few defensive players who can be considered in the second group for now because he has seen starting time before PERIOD I say for now because it is within the realm of possibility that Strong beats out senior cornerback Darrien Molton to start alongside senior defensive back Sean Harper Jr PERIOD

But for all intents and purposes we will assume the sixtime starter who appeared in  games and tied Harper for a teamleading six passbreakups along with an interception last season is among the six players Claeys is comfortable with if his number should be called PERIOD

Like Strong Rogers played a lot of meaningful time in  PERIOD Rogers played in all  games in  and started four games in lieu of three senior linebackers who were sidelined with injuries PERIOD

Rogers lives up to the Speed D title the Cougar defense adopted because he particularly shines in pass coverage PERIOD In addition to his experience on the field I think his skillset in pass coverage is a reason to be included in Claeys group of playable reserves PERIOD

Just like before you can pretty confidently assume Claeys was referring to Sherman as one of the six guys ready to go and that is simply because he has done it before PERIOD Sherman played in all  games last season initially appearing in special teams and then as a linebacker as the injuries mounted PERIOD

But the trust given to him last season was from a different defensive coordinator PERIOD This is a new season and a new defensive coordinator and it is not a guarantee Claeys sees the same contributor that former defensive coordinator Alex Grinch saw PERIOD

I think it is safe to include Sherman as a guy Claeys is confident with but not quite as safe as Strong and Rogers PERIOD I may be splitting hairs here but the emergence of sophomore linebacker Dominick Silvels could put Shermans role in jeopardy PERIOD

Here is where the true speculation begins PERIOD Anyone could have told you the three guys above were poised to contribute to the Cougars defense just by looking at the  statistics sheet PERIOD Now we are getting to guys who could potentially break out this season PERIOD

During spring camp Brock was still competing with fellow rush linebackers redshirt senior Chima Onyeukwu and redshirt sophomore Mason Vinyard but the projected starter Onyeukwu is reportedly injured and Vinyard has since fallen down the depth chart PERIOD

At  feet tall and  pounds I like Brock as a healthy backup to redshirt freshman Willie Taylor III because of what he brings in the run game PERIOD As a former defensive lineman he is a bigger body than Taylor who converted from safety to rush linebacker this offseason and has more experience defending the run at the line of scrimmage PERIOD

I think there is more on Brocks horizon in  than just a special teams player as he has been in the past two seasons PERIOD

Davis is a junior college transfer and since arriving this fall adds some sorelyneeded depth at the safety position PERIOD

As of now it is safe to say junior safety Jalen Thompsons counterpart at safety is redshirt sophomore Skyler Thomas PERIOD But Davis has the size Thomas lacks and that could prove to be beneficial in short yardage situations and in the red zone  an area of the field Claeys has put emphasis on defending since his arrival in January PERIOD

Davis was inactive for the scrimmage where Claeys made his remarks about his reserves so who knows if Davis was actually on his mind when he singled out six players PERIOD But if Davis can be the guy in the red zone that I think he can be he will be liked by Claeys PERIOD

Nunn is my dark horse for Claeys list of reserve players who are ready to go PERIOD

Every once and a while there are freshmen who show up to fall camp and dont play like freshmen  running back Max Borghi is an excellent example  and that was the case with Nunn PERIOD I think Nunns tangible skillset can make up for any intangible shortcomings that often can be found in freshmen PERIOD At  feet  inches he is absurdly lengthy which will help him in pass coverage and his 205pound frame will help him handle the physicality in the box PERIOD

Im hesitant to include Nunn in this list just as Claeys was hesitant to add a sixth guy to his initial five PERIOD But Nunn has performed well and if there is a freshman that will contribute to the Cougars defense in his first year Nunn would be that guy PERIOD

Jackson Gardner is a Senior Communication major from Woodinville Wash PERIOD his brother John Gardner is a wide receiver for the University of Washington Huskies PERIOD
