Ive always put my faith for better or worse in people PERIOD Think of me as a people person PERIOD I talk to the people standing next to me in line or on a plane PERIOD Ive always put my trust in the sound character of perfect strangers PERIOD Why do I do this I chalk it up to the influence of my grandma Mary Dumas PERIOD

At age  Mary met my papa Al as he was getting off a bus in West Haverstraw N.Y. She sashayed up to him with a cigarette dangling daintily between her fingers and offered up a line like Hey tall handsome stranger wanna elope

Soon after they did PERIOD Their union launched the lives of two innocent boys who would be subject to an often unstable upbringing peppered with the alcoholic rants of their father PERIOD Unfortunately my Papa Al died in his mid40s from a gunshot wound during a robbery after finally getting clean and sober PERIOD

After a shortlived second marriage to a cook who turned out to be a bigamist grandma opened up her ranch home in Valparaiso Ind. to transients passing through PERIOD Her home became home to anyone needing a room for a few weeks or months PERIOD Im fairly sure her background checks included the production of some form of identification library cards were OK and a  deposit although an IOU was perfectly acceptable PERIOD

I remember dozens of truck drivers waitresses mechanics and roustabouts who took a room at grandmas house PERIOD

When I went for a sleepover I never knew who would be there until morning when the boarders would gather around the kitchen counter eating eggs fried in bacon grease and drinking endless cups of syrupy coffee PERIOD Grandma never offered unwanted advice she only listened to their stories laughed at their jokes and offered a little comfort in a world that I didnt think offered much PERIOD

Things didnt always work out for Grandma like the second husband who turned out to be a liar and a cheat PERIOD But I think my grandmas life was interesting largely due to her faith in people PERIOD

In parallel my life has taken interesting turns as Ive opened my mind and heart to the strangers that surround me PERIOD I recall at age  waiting on the tarmac in LaGuardia to board a plane to Madrid where I would spend my junior year abroad. i began speaking with a Spanish family that had been vacationing in New York. after one hour of waiting and talking we boarded the plane and the mom handed me their telephone number PERIOD I didnt call for a few months but finally did just to say hello PERIOD  After accepting an invitation to dinner we became friends PERIOD I eventually lived with them for a while PERIOD Years later their daughter lived with me for a summer and her parents Donna and Jos Miguel have also been to Chicago to visit PERIOD I consider the Sierras my second family PERIOD Thanks for including me in your family Donna PERIOD

And theres the time I spoke with the group of deepsea explorers as we were boarding a boat in Portsmouth Va. That hourlong conversation led to an interview that secured my job with the Columbia America Discovery Group where I led marketing efforts for an ocean shipwreck recovery group PERIOD That was one of the most exciting times in my career you can read about our adventure in the bestseller by Gary Kinder Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea. thanks for believing in me Tommy PERIOD

One of my most lifechanging moments was when I sat on a plane to New York next to an Indian man who was watching lovely videos of his children a boy and a girl in Indian costume dancing and enjoying birthday celebrations at home PERIOD I assumed he was a consultant on the road missing his children PERIOD I commented on how beautiful his children are PERIOD He thanked me and said Yes they were so beautiful. were I asked hesitantly. yes my wife set them and herself on fire and they all died. tears welled up as I told him how sorry I was PERIOD In fact Id followed this story on the news PERIOD It happened in Naperville only a few months prior PERIOD He shared how a renewed commitment to his faith has helped him get out of bed each day PERIOD Thanks for sharing your secret to go on living while in deepest despair Anand PERIOD

When my son was  I was pushing him in a stroller down the sidewalk in front of my house. as we passed a woman and her stroller my son got wildly excited PERIOD He said Mommy mommy this is my friend Patrick and his mommy. he must have met them at the park with his nanny one day when I was not there. my 3yearold son was making introductions PERIOD

The spirit of Mary Dumas lives on PERIOD
