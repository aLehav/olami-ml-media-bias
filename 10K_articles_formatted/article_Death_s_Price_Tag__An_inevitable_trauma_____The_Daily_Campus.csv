7010,2023-11-03,"in the spirit of October I figured I should speak on a topic Im passionate about as someone considering endoflife care as a career I gag at the connotation of making a career of death care but such is the nature of capitalism the funeral industry PERIOD Let that phrase sink in for a second Funeral PERIOD Industry PERIOD Death that generates financial capital PERIOD Death a necessary and inevitable part of the human experience costs and generates money PERIOD

Death is a tough subject and for good reason PERIOD Its a reminder of all of our mortalities and thats a lot to be confronted with especially considering how capitalism makes us proletarians believe that were inhuman that well simply be exploited for an indeterminate amount of time and then disappear from relevance PERIOD This alienation from mortality and personhood diminishes the depth of life brought about by our own mortality and then once confronted with it the capitalistroboproletarian illusion shatters bringing great distress but no room to heal from it due to the standard  to  workday and low wages PERIOD

Let me step back and explain what I mean by this though PERIOD Many people work some variation of aneighthour shift job PERIOD If theyre full time thats about  hours per week sometimes more which leaves one or two days off PERIOD The Ford model of the work day is supposed to beeighthours of workeighthours of leisure andeighthours of rest PERIOD This treats human needs as if they were easy to standardize PERIOD It takes no account for commutes obtaining and preparing food the amount of sleep an individual needs to function or difference of ability as this does vary widely in the working population PERIOD Some people forfeit another one of theseeighthour blocks working two jobs to make ends meet PERIOD How much time does that leave for the necessities nourishment and sleep Not much PERIOD How much time does that leave for selfactualization Barely any PERIOD So how much time does that leave to process grief specifically Almost none PERIOD Capitalism forces us to go about our lives broken and exploited many without the means to mend our psyches due to the high cost of mental healthcare and healthcare in general PERIOD

Now to the funeral industrial complex PERIOD Think for a minutewhat would you consider a dignified burial for a loved one who left behind no death plan Maybe cremation maybe burial in a casket but not much else PERIOD Cremation is the cheaper option and embalmed casket burials are often expensive PERIOD Not only do they take into account the labor from the funeral home for a service but also the labor of embalming which is widely overused in the United States due to its popularity in the Civil War for the transport of the bodies of soldiers and the price of the casket and headstone PERIOD Caskets run around1200give or take and funeral homes often mark them up to generate profit PERIOD Headstones vary widely but can run from around65 toover200 PERIOD This doesnt take into account any markups from manufacturers either PERIOD Plots can run around350to5000 embalming costs upwards of500 PERIOD Add in flowers and concessions and you get an idea as to why traditional American funerals are so expensive PERIOD

So I would like to talk about some alternatives PERIOD Firstly theres donating your corpse to science which is my plan PERIOD Thisinvolvesones bodybeingbrought to whatever scientific institution needs cadavers medical schools mainly for educational use and then discarded in mass graves afterwards PERIOD There are no direct costs with this approach but you can always hold a service for a loved one who donates their body just without their cadaver PERIOD Theres also natural burial either in a plain shroud or one with a seed pod PERIOD Connecticut has multiple natural burial grounds around the state.Better Place Forestsprices ceremonies based on the memorial tree you want starting at around  for the cheapest option PERIOD Depending on the grounds you choose prices will vary and without a tree the burial would be cheaper as well PERIOD Other options includeAquamationwhich is legal for humans and pets in Connecticutfor those concerned with ecofriendliness andfeed blocksmixing cremated remains into feed blocks for woodland animals PERIOD

So what changes do I think need to be made

I think that funerary and end of life care should cease to be an industry just as medicine infrastructure internet plumbingand the like should cease to be industries PERIOD A shift in governmental values from those serving the class with the highest accumulation of capital to serving the working class PERIOD A shift towards democracy centered on proletarian needs PERIOD A shift to a human collectivecentered culture rather than a profitcentered one PERIOD Replace dogeatdog with camaraderie PERIOD Truly place power in the hands of the people and build a world of collaboration and healing PERIOD

Death is a very difficult event for the family and friends of the deceased PERIOD Therefore there simply must be a person who can answer questions like body decomposition in casket
