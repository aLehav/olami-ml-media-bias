Vivian Bigelow a nurse practitioner discusses birth control options with a patient at a Planned Parenthood health center in Plano Texas PERIOD The Republican healthcare plans would prohibit Medicaid recipients from using their benefits at Planned Parent facilities for one year PERIOD Katie FalkenbergLos Angeles TimesTNS

OnOct PERIOD  under the leadership of President Donald Trump the U.S PERIOD Department of Health and Human Services issued a new ruling thatll make it harder for women to access contraceptives PERIOD The new policy allows employers to opt out of the Obama administration mandate PERIOD Obamas mandate required employers to provide employees with birthcontrol coverage in its health insurance plans even if it conflicted with their religious or moral beliefs PERIOD

Before Trumps new ruling this sort of power was limited to churches but now its being put in the hands of businesses and organizations that may also hold moral objections PERIOD Although the new ruling is an attempt of Trump to fulfill his promise of protecting religious rights his administration fails to realize that this new law could potentially violate the civil liberty protections of not only women but those who are a part of the LGBTQ community as well PERIOD

CNN states that HHS officials insist that out of  million women in America  many of whom havent yet reached childbearing years  nearly . percent of women wont be affected PERIOD By the agencys calculations at most  would be affected mainly those who work at the  entities that have been involved in roughly  lawsuits over birthcontrol coverage regarding religious freedom PERIOD

On the contrary this new ruling provides room for other organizations  on top of the  entities previously mentioned  to exercise control over the regulation of birth control if it doesnt correlate with their religious and moral beliefs PERIOD

Tim Jost an emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University of Law claims there are hundreds of Catholic hospitals nursing homes and nonprofits that may also want to stop providing contraceptives PERIOD

A plethora of critics have risen in response to the new ruling including groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union the National Womens Law Center Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi the Center for Reproductive Rights and the office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra PERIOD

The Trump Administrations despicable new rule reaches into the lives of hundreds of thousands of women overrules their right to basic preventive care and forces them to pay a huge new cost Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said in anofficial statement after the ruling was put into its course PERIOD This administrations contempt for women reaches a new low with this appalling decision to enable employers and health plans to deny women basic coverage for contraception. the American Civil Liberties Union has even filed a lawsuit against the Trump administrations new ruling labeling it as discriminatory PERIOD

To make matters worse according to the National Womens Law Center more than  million U.S PERIOD women have birthcontrol coverage thats fully covered by their health insurance PERIOD The center further states that the mandate saved women an estimated . billion on birth control pills in  PERIOD

The Trump administration just took direct aim at birth control coverage for  million women Cecile Richards president of Planned Parenthood said PERIOD This is an unacceptable attack on basic health care that the vast majority of women rely on PERIOD With this rule in place any employer could decide that their employees no longer have health insurance coverage for birth control. the new mandate could even cause a rise in pregnancies PERIOD With prices varying from160600 a year including the possible35250 doctor visitation fee many women rely on healthinsurance coverage to practice safe sex without the risk of pregnancy PERIOD By allowing businesses and organizations the power to take away healthinsurance funding for birth control this could ultimately make it harder for women to access needed contraceptives thus resulting in higher pregnancies PERIOD

HHS leaders under the current administration are focused on turning back the clock on womens healthReducing access to contraceptive coverage threatens to reverse the tremendous progress our nation has made in recent years in lowering the unintended pregnancy rate. regardless of Trumps attempt to ensure religious liberties the power thats now being given to organizations and business is a direct violation of womens rights PERIOD Women depend on contraceptives for a myriad of other reasons aside from preventing pregnancy PERIOD In fact they depend on it for health concerns that include the regulation of irregular or absent menstrual cycles menstrual cramps acne premenstrual syndrome endometriosis primary ovarian insufficiency and polycystic ovary syndrome PERIOD Its absurd to allow ones religious beliefs to hold so much weight on whether one can receive something as crucial as birth control PERIOD

In America ones religious beliefs should always be respected and valued by those in disagreement PERIOD However ones moral values and beliefs shouldnt be a potential barrier for someone who may need birth control to prevent pregnancy or even for something as critical as a health concern PERIOD

Some supporters may try to argue that this new mandate will prevent women from behaving promiscuously PERIOD Nevertheless women are entitled to behave in whatever way they choose given that they are responsible for the consequences PERIOD Furthermore although the weight falls more on the shoulder of women it affects men as well given theyll have to be much more responsible and weary of an unexpected pregnancy due to the fact thatcondoms arent as effective especially if used incorrectly PERIOD

Access to birth control has changed the lives of many by allowing them to properly regulate pregnancies as well as other health risks PERIOD Through this mandate Trump is violating womens rights and those who could be potential targets of religious organizations such as members of the LGBTQ community PERIOD Regardless of whether he was trying to protect religious liberties the mandate is unjust and funding shouldnt be taken away from women due to someone elses religious beliefs that have absolutely nothing to do with them PERIOD With this new passing its time for women to speak up and speak louder than ever before PERIOD
