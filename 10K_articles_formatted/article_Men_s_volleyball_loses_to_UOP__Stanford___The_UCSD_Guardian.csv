6223,2023-10-08,"despite some shakeups in its lineup the UCSD mens volleyball team remains winless in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation after a pair of road losses against University of the Pacific and Stanford University PERIOD

In Stockton Calif. on Feb PERIOD  the Tritons entered the match against UOP with hopes of upsetting the ninthranked Tigers but despite a strong start UCSD was swept in three games    PERIOD

In game one the Tritons outhit the Tigers . to . but could not come up with the victory falling short by three points PERIOD UCSDs attack percentage deflated to . in the second game but UOP elevated its efficiency hitting . to take the second game easily PERIOD

After a long string of frustrations Triton head coach Ron Larsen shifted setter Eric Perrine to outside hitter and brought junior Tye Thoreson in to set PERIOD The switch did not yield immediate results and the Tigers rolled to the sweep PERIOD

Jim Waller led UCSD with  kills Perrine and Thoreson combined for  assists and libero Chris Mortimer paced the defense with a matchhigh  digs PERIOD

Mortimer commented later about the frustrations of the recent Tritons play and the familiarity of the situation in which UCSD found itself PERIOD

Its felt the same the last few matches we lost especially against BYU where were playing really well for periods of times during games  were just not able to extend that over the course of a competitive match he said PERIOD

The following night the Tritons suffered from more of the same against Stanford PERIOD Despite the absence of the Cardinals  AllAmerican opposite Curt Toppel Stanford had more than enough firepower to take care of UCSD PERIOD

The Cardinals started quickly and sprinted out to an early lead PERIOD David Vogel put down backtoback kills to stretch the lead to  after that Stanford didnt look back going on to a  victory PERIOD

The Tritons were far more offensively competitive in game two with Thoreson doing the setting for the match and picking up  kills PERIOD That would not be enough however since Stanford squeezed out a  win PERIOD

Down  and after losing a tough game UCSD could have quit but instead fought back bravely in game three PERIOD Waller picked up five of his teamhigh  kills and combined with Perrine and Brian Foott on a block at game point to give the Tritons a  victory PERIOD

It was Stanford that enjoyed most of the dominance at the net compiling  blocks on the evening PERIOD In the fourth game the Cardinals pressured UCSD into nine hitting errors for a total of  on the match and Stanford took a  decision for the  win PERIOD

Thoreson dished out  assists on the night and Mortimer and Perrine each picked up  digs but the story of the match was UCSDs two biggest offensive weapons Waller and Perrine who combined for  attack errors PERIOD

We kind of struggled all night on Feb PERIOD  with hitting errors Mortimer said PERIOD It was reflective of both good blocking by Stanford and careless hitting errors. uCSD returns home Feb PERIOD  for matches against CSU Northridge and UC Santa Barbara hoping to cut down on errors and pick up the elusive first MPSF win PERIOD
