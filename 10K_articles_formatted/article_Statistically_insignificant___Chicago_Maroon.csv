2239,2022-03-16,"when examining landmark judicial cases that could fundamentally change how the Constitution frames society we dont always have the benefit of hindsight PERIOD But when we do as in the case of the Supreme Court hearing arguments for the support or vacation of Proposition  in California we dont often take advantage of itespecially when were dealing with questions that have to do with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution PERIOD This is an absolute shame PERIOD

Consider this How many of us know offhand the statistics of how children of interracial families fare in school Or how society in general is affected by interracial marriages Or if striking down antimiscegenation laws affects social institutions If youre anything like me these questions will seem not only irrelevant but also downright offensive PERIOD When it comes to fundamental rights waiting for numbers seems not only superfluous but also unfair PERIOD Consider if somebody told you they needed to wait on the data of how your choice of religion would impact society before she granted you the right to believe in it PERIOD

Unfortunately a great deal of the conversation in the oral arguments presented before the Supreme Court on the legitimacy and constitutionality of Californias Proposition  focused on exactly these statistics PERIOD Justice Kennedy in particular often considered a swing member in an otherwise equally divided Supreme Court advanced just this sort of waitandsee attitude proposing that sociological information on the effects of samesex marriage is required before the court settles on a decision that would affect all states many of which are still far from reconsidering bans on samesex marriage PERIOD

This argument implies the belief that states should be allowed to wrestle with such tough questions on their own and experiment with what road they want to take before the Supreme Court makes a ruling PERIOD Thats exactly the argument that Justice Sotomayor one of the Courts liberal judges made PERIOD If that argument prevails the cases on Proposition  could be dismissed PERIOD This perhaps would be equivalent to the Court postponing its decision to a later date when things are much more clearthanks to sociological data provided by states that have already approved samesex marriage which would make for an ironic sort of circular argument Im still having trouble with PERIOD Here again hindsight would be useful PERIOD As National Journal observes  states still had bans in place when the Supreme Court finally struck down antimiscegenation laws in  PERIOD With such a track record its highly possible that decades will pass before the Supreme Court sees fit to decide on this fundamental right one that could have saved a lot of people a great deal of unhappiness if the power of hindsight were heeded PERIOD

All of this could be waved away if one argued that by and large if states dont seem on board with samesex marriage it seems a tad dictatorial to rule on something most people clearly dont want PERIOD However there is a clear trend in the way attitudes are changing Political support for gay marriage has burgeoned recently PERIOD The Rhode Island Senate voted to pass gay marriage legislation on Wednesday Illinoiss Republican Senator Mark Kirk recently endorsed samesex marriage a good omen for a state likely to go the way of Rhode Island in May PERIOD Gay marriage legislation is on its way in the Delaware Senate as well a spate of highprofile Republicans such as Ohios Rob Portman are changing their positions on gay marriage PERIOD Public support for gay marriage as reported by many recent polls seems to finally have reached a narrow majority PERIOD Times are quickly changing PERIOD It is therefore downright shocking that carping about effects takes precedence over arguments about principleespecially on an issue on which heads are slowly turning in a single direction PERIOD

Dont be too worried though PERIOD It seems unlikely that sociological data will suggest that samesex parents are anything other than equally suitable to their heterosexual counterparts PERIOD And societyparticularly the institution of marriagemost decidedly will not burst at the seams PERIOD Perhaps what naysayers need is a healthy dose of New Zealand M.P PERIOD Maurice Williamson whose stirring speech to the Parliament moments before it legalized samesex marriage addressed just such concerns I give a promise to those people who are opposed to this bill right nowthe sun will still rise tomorrow your teenage daughter will still argue back with you as if she knows everything your mortgage will not grow you will not have skin disease or rashes or toads in your bed PERIOD For most of us life will go on. kamil Ahsan is a firstyear graduate student in the biological sciences division PERIOD
