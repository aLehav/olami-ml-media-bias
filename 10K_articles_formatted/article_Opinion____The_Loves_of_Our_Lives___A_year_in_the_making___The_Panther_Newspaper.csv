Although I am not an English student I have always loved creative writing and it has been a hobby of mine for years PERIOD

Amid the pandemic I dedicated more time and attention toward my writing and through this I produced a story I am extremely proud of PERIOD

On May  I published the literary fiction novel The Loves of Our Lives with the Washington D.C.based publishing company New Degree Press PERIOD

This novel is loosely based on the personal experiences of myself my mother and my grandmother PERIOD I have gained inspiration from them throughout my life and through the combination of our life experience and family stories a novel felt like the perfect medium to showcase these experiences PERIOD

The story follows three characters Emi Jo and Willa navigating their lives through the timeline of their romantic relationships with many twists and turns along the way PERIOD Beginning in the 1950s and spanning to present day one learns that the road to love can be a winding path PERIOD

This creation process spanned over the past year and was an incredible journey PERIOD I gained this opportunity through the Book Creators program led by Georgetown University and had many writing mentors help with the development of my work PERIOD Through this experience alone I learned so much about myself as well as my writing and exactly what it takes to share a piece of work on a broader scale PERIOD I highly recommend applying to this program if you would like to learn what it takes to develop a piece of work and become a published author PERIOD

This book is available on Amazon Barnes and Noble and other sellers in both ebook and paperback form PERIOD If you read it thank you so much for your support writing a review always helps the author reach a broader audience PERIOD

I hope that this story inspires you to learn more about your own family history PERIOD For me this was a perfect opportunity to grow even closer with my family members PERIOD Through embodying characters with traits resembling real people I feel closer to those around me PERIOD
