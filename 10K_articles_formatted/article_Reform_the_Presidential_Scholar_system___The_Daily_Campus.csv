8335,2023-10-25,"sMU is proud to showcase its Presidential Scholars and the Presidential Scholar system and rightly so PERIOD Taken as a whole these students are intelligent enthusiastic openminded and genuine in their search for knowledge wherever they can find it PERIOD I am blessed to count many of these scholars as my closest  friends PERIOD

Yet problems remain PERIOD My main problem with the PS program is the interview system says one scholar PERIOD While no interview system can be foolproof I feel that some interviewers are either inadequately trained or completely unaware of the importance of their assessments of the candidates PERIOD Some interviewers grade the interviewees far too lightly which consequently obscures the differences between the truly deserving and those less worthy PERIOD Having spent a good deal of time with a number of examples of such ignorant beneficence I feel that something within the process must be changed lest the program lose its legitimacy. this would be a tragedy PERIOD The Presidential Scholar system is of great benefit to various stakeholders in the university students sponsors and the university itself PERIOD Every student knows of the full scholarship that is given to each scholar yet other benefits accrue to each scholar as well PERIOD There are perks like being more likely to go to Tate Lectures the trip to Taos over Labor day Theres a lot of networking thats available PERIOD Martha Starke who is like the PS Mom is in touch with just about everyone everywhere and we get opportunities for jobs from faculty members and information on fellowships. the university markets Presidential Scholars aggressively to promote the image of a school personally involved in the future of its brightest students PERIOD Those students after all go on to represent the university in their respective futures building value secondhand for the school in terms of reputation ties and networking and monetary value PERIOD Sponsors are comforted with the knowledge that they are securing a brighter future for a student and giving them opportunities they would not have as a normal student at the university PERIOD

Yet herein lies the current problem Too many Presidential Scholars are just normal students in a relative sense of course PERIOD Since those in charge of choosing future scholars are allowed to be so selective and employ such an exhaustive process of applications and multiple interviews it would stand to reason that every student who emerges successful from the process should be of outstanding academic caliber possess the most upstanding character and be endowed with the highest quality personal traits PERIOD

Yet I have heard multiple stories of a few scholars drinking to extreme excess habitually using drugs being indolent lazy boorish arrogant and generally unconcerned about academic affairs PERIOD Bear in mind this is an extremely small percentage no more than two or three in each class but as I mentioned previously with the exhaustive process that is used to screen the applicants this is statistically too many PERIOD

This is not all that is imbalanced in this equation PERIOD With so few scholarships to award it is a shame that some are given to inappropriate candidates PERIOD There are two ways to resolve this and because the program is of such critical importance both must be undertaken PERIOD The Presidents Scholars Office can and should be much more thorough in its screening process as well as expand the program significantly to capture more equally worthy students PERIOD For example the program should give substantial thought to expanding the selection criteria to make it less subjective and narrow PERIOD Relying on only a few objective criteria such as GPA or SAT scores and subjective feelings about a certain candidates application may be easy and simple but it does a disfavor to those whose qualifications are broader and not easily captured by the current criteria PERIOD

Only by combining these two approaches will there be significant progress toward resolving the current issues PERIOD Yet there are encouraging signs of willingness to reform PERIOD One current scholar stated The Presidents Scholars Office has been very receptive to changes suggested by the scholars and hopefully these new changes will work well with the next interview PERIOD There have always been questions about the selection system particularly when there are very qualified people who arent scholars but then again no system is perfect PERIOD Currently the system itself is going to stay the same but there will be more input from the current scholars themselves. for the sake of fairness to future candidates it must be reformed PERIOD For the sake of sponsors and their money it must be reformed PERIOD For the sake of the university and its reputation now and in the future it must be reformed PERIOD
