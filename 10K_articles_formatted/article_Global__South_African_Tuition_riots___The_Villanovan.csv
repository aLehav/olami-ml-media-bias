Last Wednesday Oct PERIOD  riots were held outside the South African Parliament building in Cape Town after president Jacob Zuma announced a plan for an increase in college tuition PERIOD Students from several major cities like Johannesburg and Cape Town were in an uproar over the government PERIOD Though not all of the protests were violent some escalated to the point where police had to use stun grenades in response to students storming Union Buildings setting fires and slashing car tires PERIOD

The hash tag FeesMustFall began to trend as tuitions to university were proposed to be increased by  percent. a student at the University of Cape Town Motheo Lengoasa said This looks like  all over again. in  in the Soweto area of Johannesburg South Africa a brutal protest was held because students disagreed with a forgotten law that secondary education be conducted only in Afrikaans as opposed to English or another native language PERIOD

Though last weeks riot was not as deadly as the  riot it only reminded the South African community of the disagreements in educational policies PERIOD

Blade Nzimande the higher education minister eventually proposed a six percent increase on tuition starting next year but the students claimed they would continue protests because that increase is still too high PERIOD Because of the large number of people participating in the protests including a 1000person march the government has halted its plan to increase fees for the time being PERIOD

The concern of university tuition is one that students in the United States face as well PERIOD According to College Board the cost of tuition fees and room and board in the U.S PERIOD in  for a private nonprofit fouryear college was  in  the cost has risen to  PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD has seen gradual increases over the years below two percent per year compared to universities in South Africa which were going to see an increase of six percent within the year PERIOD

As students across the world are infuriated with the cost of education these days most people cant help but compare their countrys educational system to that of Germanys because it provides free tuition PERIOD Student leader Mcebo Dlamini stated the reality of the matter is that in country postindependence the black students have still been oppressed were still marginalized we struggle to get into universities. he also said  we are poor we are calling for free education in our lifetime PERIOD Germany did it we can do it. if the government decides to increase university tuition as much as they claim people like Dlamini will not have a chance at attaining a higher education PERIOD

Surprisingly the United States has not seen riots over tuition like the ones that took place in the cities of South Africa even though the cost for university is through the roof PERIOD In  the University of California experienced protests from students and faculty due to an increase in fees but the U.S PERIOD has never had riots on the scale that Cape Town did last week PERIOD

All over the world students are in an uproar wondering why something so imperative as education is limited to those members of society that can afford the tuition PERIOD The fight for lower costs is vital for our generation and especially for the generations to come PERIOD
