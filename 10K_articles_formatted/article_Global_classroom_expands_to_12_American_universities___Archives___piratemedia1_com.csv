 said Elmer Poe one of the creators of the global classroom PERIOD

Each semester in the global classroom consists of one week of introduction to the culture facts and figures and different ways they live and survive within their culture PERIOD

The following three weeks are dedicated to interaction with the students PERIOD Connected via Internet with video and audio students get to be face to face with their counterparts across the world PERIOD Then students have one week to discuss what they learned and how if any their ideas have changed about that culture PERIOD This is done three times with a different country each time PERIOD

 Poe said PERIOD

In each classroom there are no windows as sunlight can affect the clearness of the screens PERIOD There is no fixed furniture in the room because students are always moving around to talk with each other and their counterparts on the screen PERIOD The professors one from each country are constantly collaborating so the lectures are the same PERIOD In the rare case both audio and video go down the professors fall back to their lesson plans PERIOD

 Poe said PERIOD

The lecture is taught in English with students from other countries speaking English as well PERIOD
