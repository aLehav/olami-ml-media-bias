6234,2023-10-08,"oN CAMPUS  Last Friday Muir College students voted to fork over another  per year to keep their colleges organizations and events afloat PERIOD

However after A.S PERIOD Council nearly doubled its funding last year with a pricey referendum it seems college councils might be better off asking their rich Price Center uncle to fill spending gaps before scapegoating students PERIOD

The referendum to be instituted Spring Quarter  will increase Muir Colleges activity fee from  to  per quarter to offset the Muir College Councils depleted reserves PERIOD With only  in unallocated funds as opposed to last years  the council needed more money for unforeseen future costs and those lastminute pizza study breaks  and they got it PERIOD

Once upon a time  as recently as the  academic year  individual college councils sought out funding from A.S PERIOD Council which is rolling in it this year with  in Concerts and Events funding at its disposal PERIOD

Thing is the old system required student orgs to jump through seven separate fundingrequest hoops to get their hands on fees begging each college for a little cash before grovelingon the fourth floor of Price Center for even more PERIOD

The overhaul which sent those orgs directly to the A.S PERIOD floor was intended to make the funding process simpler for everyone college councils included  as theyd no longer have to decide how many Benjamins the knitting club deserves PERIOD

Currently the colleges dont receive a dime from the A.S PERIOD Council PERIOD Instead every cent they spend comes from a separate smaller activity fee on our student bills PERIOD It may be a more streamlined approach but its also problematic PERIOD When college councils go broke which happens a lot theres only one place for them to turn their students PERIOD

As anyone whos ever witnessed a studentcashier battle at Cafe Ventanas knows doughnuts it turns out are actually . we students arent very willing to shell out PERIOD During Winter Quarter  both Muir College and Sixth College tried to pass marginal fee referendums just like this one PERIOD Muirs failed PERIOD This time around the measure just barely passed  with a mere 52percent support rate PERIOD

Four bucks a quarter may not amount to much more than one sacrificed Perks cappuccino but  on principle  the six college councils should be able to petition A.S PERIOD Council to help fill their funding gaps before begging their apathetic student bodies PERIOD

After its own lucrative referendum last year the A.S PERIOD Council is the sole institution on campus with more money to spend than it knows what to do with PERIOD It would be far more cost effective to use the funding we already have than to tax students even more PERIOD

A.S PERIOD President Utsav Gupta said funding college councils would take away from the money now set aside for allcampus orgs PERIOD He insisted all  of their allocation has already been set aside for one group or another this year PERIOD

But even if its not possible for A.S PERIOD Council to lend Muir College Council a generous hand this year it could be feasible in the future PERIOD Its not impossible to rewrite A.S PERIOD legislation  councilmembers did it four years ago and can do it again PERIOD Their selfproclaimed mission after all is to promote student engagement in all areas of campus life  and they should spread that involvement to all areas of campus PERIOD

Gupta has expressed interest in doing just that PERIOD He wants college councils to host their own events the day of the Sun God Festival to expand the event to other parts of campus PERIOD But money for that has to come from somewhere and A.S PERIOD has far more in reserves than do college councils PERIOD If the A.S PERIOD Council wants to see that type of participation theyll need to make sure its funded PERIOD

Before this can happen though the A.S PERIOD Council must communicate more with the college councils PERIOD As it stands the councils themselves operate almost autonomously from the Associated Students PERIOD The only semblance of discussion between the two comes from a pair of senators from each college serving on both the A.S PERIOD Council and their respective college councils PERIOD

A couple gobetween figureheads cant lead a real cooperative effort to serve the student body  in order for that to happen and for the possibility of greater collaboration and cashswapping down the line college councils should at least hold quarterly meetings with Gupta PERIOD He may not be the sugar daddy they need him to be now but forging a stronger counciltocouncil connection will in the end push individual colleges interests to the forefront PERIOD
