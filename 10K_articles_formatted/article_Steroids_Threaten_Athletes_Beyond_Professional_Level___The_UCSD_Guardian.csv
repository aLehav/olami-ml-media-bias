6216,2023-10-08,"though baseballs homerhitting icon Barry Bonds steroid bust was a heartbreaker for many staunch Giants fans it was a muchneeded eyeopener for the athletic world where performanceenhancing drugs are becoming unsettlingly prevalent PERIOD The 42yearold Bonds has denied the alleged claims testifying that he was given the undetectable steroids by his trainer in the form of a clear substance that he believed to be a nutritional supplement made of flaxseed oil and a cream he thought was a painrelieving balm for his arthritis PERIOD

While many naive people choose to buy into this act the majority lean toward the overwhelming evidence that suggests Bonds was fully aware of the true nature of these drugs and their purposes PERIOD His trainer Greg Anderson has been accused of to selling steroids to numerous athletes including Bonds with whom he worked very closely PERIOD

Bonds also endorsed the performanceenhancing drug company BALCO run by scientist and supplement provider Victor Conte who was busted for selling illegal steroids to many famous athletes including some in the NFL and the Olympic Games PERIOD Back in September of  the FBI discovered records and calendars of Bonds longtime steroid cycles PERIOD

There were also rumors circulated by Bonds exgirlfriend who claimed that he became aggressive and carried around what she called his man bag from which he popped as many as  pills at a time PERIOD Not to mention the fact that his drastic physical transformation and increase in personal achievements were obvious to anyone who followed his career PERIOD

The bigger issue however is athletes desire to bulk up for a competitive edge is gradually spinning out of control PERIOD Bonds only served as a harsh reminder of a reality that many are hushhush about PERIOD It is expanding outside the more common areas of bodybuilding and wrestling to all levels of athleticism from club leagues to highschool and collegeaffiliated sports and even to the average Joe pumping iron at the gym PERIOD

This sets a bad standard for the youth of today telling them to do whatever it takes to reach the top PERIOD A report by the Department of Health and Human Services stated that  percent of teenage boys and . percent of teenage girls use steroids PERIOD

The pressures to maintain a positive body image and keep top rankings push too many people to resort to unhealthy measures PERIOD The leniency of drug testing in the sports world only makes matters worse PERIOD Its a vicious cycle that is turning too many kids idols into cheaters and drug abusers PERIOD

While watching ESPN or Fox Sports its difficult to see the  footplus guys with veiny muscles bulging from their jerseys and not wonder how many of them are shooting or popping PERIOD The media tries to push it aside and desensitize the issue while those directly involved with the athletes such as coaches or teammates hold back their suspicions and dont ask questions PERIOD People need to speak out not only for the health of the users but for the protection and integrity of sports as a whole PERIOD Or perhaps we dont really care as much as we say

Despite clear health detriments and other effects some people dont see the downside of steroids PERIOD

Steroids dont take away from natural ability Revelle College freshman and sports fanatic Darren Matsumoto said PERIOD They have nothing to do with skill or coordination. while there is a grain of truth to this its disturbing how easily some dismiss the fact that steroids are illegal and that users gain an unfair advantage over others PERIOD If one person uses steroids then should everyone What if your role model were on steroids or that one person on your team who always gets more playing time than you or the opponent who clobbers you on the field

I would feel disappointed in that person that he felt that he had to succumb to using steroids in order to be the same as all the other athletes and that he couldnt do it on his own personal strength Revelle sophomore Eleni Alevizos said PERIOD At the same time I would understand why he did it PERIOD I know that many athletes have tough competition and when everyone else is doing it it is hard to resist something that can make it easier regardless of the negative effects. other students are less merciful PERIOD I would be really crushed Thurgood Marshall College sophomore Jacques Spitzer said PERIOD It is cheating and it would be hard to respect anything they had done in their career PERIOD Their integrity would be destroyed PERIOD I might be able to forgive them but not support them. there is not a professional sports player out there who has not seen this sort of drug abuse but to succumb to it takes away that highcaliber level of playing that the athlete has worked so hard to reach PERIOD Respect is the main issue Revelle freshman Martin Hofmann said PERIOD There are always going to be temptations for anyone in any area but its about sticking by your principles. john Muir College alumna Lori Hwangbo points out that it takes more than just muscle mass to gain this socalled respect as an athlete PERIOD

I would much rather support a soso athlete who makes up for his shortcomings with a lot of heart and effort than a dishonest juicedup athlete who just whacks homers she said PERIOD

The negativity surrounding Bonds dangles in the air of her speech PERIOD After all people have every right to be stirred by his actions and these emotions are only intensified as Bonds threatens to break Hank Aarons career home run record PERIOD

After seeing such tragic downfalls because of steroids and the risks involved with surrendering to them one can only hope that people will soon realize that its just not worth it PERIOD What exactly are steroid users accomplishing anyway Sure they may like the sense of power and the defined abdominals and carved arms in the mirror but inside they are tearing up their bodies and minds with heart disease tumors tissue damage depression and countless other side effects PERIOD Last time I checked balding impotent acnepocked men with raging aggression and paranoia and irritable angry women with deep voices rockhard breasts and beards were not in high demand in the dating world PERIOD Athletes need to stop focusing so much on results and go back to finding the joy in a healthy diet and training regimen and  the pure love of the game PERIOD
