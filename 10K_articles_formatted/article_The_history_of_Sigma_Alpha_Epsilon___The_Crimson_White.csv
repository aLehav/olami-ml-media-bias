7932,2021-03-13,"the Crimson White was recently given the opportunity to tour the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house in an effort to understand more about the history of the oldest fraternity on campus and in the South PERIOD The delegation of reporters and a photojournalist were given a tour of the 70yearold house by SAEs chapter president Jesse Blount PERIOD

I get calls all the time from people just wanting to tour the house Blount said PERIOD

The SAE house at UA is hard to miss PERIOD Located directly on University Boulevard next to Gallalee Hall it hulks over the surrounding landscape. a large front lawn separates it from the major road and frames the stately ancientstyle building PERIOD Sculptures of twin lions lying in a prone position sit at the foot of the steps that lead the way to an old ornate front door complete with matching king cat knockers PERIOD

The University of Alabama is home to  greek organizations according to the Office of Greek Affairs PERIOD Many of the sororities and fraternities have notable historical value but SAE is especially significant PERIOD It was actually founded on the Alabama campus on March   which makes it the first national fraternity founded in the South PERIOD

This remarkable history is evident in the house PERIOD A wealth of artifacts can be found in nearly every room on the first floor PERIOD In the formal room sits a display case in which old photos of past members and other relics including the cornerstone of the original house are kept PERIOD Paintings of the founding members line the walls and almost every other object in the room has some connection to the past PERIOD

The original house was actually spared from the Union when they burned down many buildings on campus Blount said about Yankee troops that invaded and destroyed much of the campus during the Civil War PERIOD

Sigma Alpha Epsilon was founded by Noble Leslie DeVotie and seven of his closest friends according to the chapter website PERIOD DeVotie wanted to create an organization that would spread the warm friendships he and his friends had already formed on the campus of the University. the Alabama SAE website continues to describe the path of the fraternity through the Civil War PERIOD The miracle in the history of SAE is that it survived that great sectional conflict PERIOD The majority of the fraternity members less than  fought for the Confederacy but seven of them did fight for the Union PERIOD Seventy members became casualties of the war PERIOD

The founder was actually the first casualty of the Civil War said Blount referencing the premature death of DeVotie who drowned after a freak accident aboard a Confederate steamer en route to pick up war supplies on Feb PERIOD   PERIOD

After the war the fraternity experienced a period of rapid growth that has led to its major influence nationwide PERIOD

However there is another side to SAEs story PERIOD In its 160year history the Alabama Mu chapter has not had one black student join its ranks PERIOD However this is not the case for many other chapters across the country PERIOD Ironically one AfricanAmerican SAE member at Cornell University died in February after being tied up and forced to consume so much alcohol that he was found with a blood alcohol content of . according to an ABC News report PERIOD The family is suing the national Sigma Alpha Epsilon branch for  million PERIOD

SAE responded to this incident by issuing a press release which reiterated its zero tolerance policy on underage drinking PERIOD SAE also sponsors a hazing hotline 1888NOTHAZE PERIOD

Despite troubles at other SAE chapters UAs chapter is well regarded in the greek world PERIOD It has made impressive strides in academics as well now ranked as having the fifth best chapter GPA among the  active fraternities up from twenty-fifth in  PERIOD

Today the fraternity still strives to honor the original ideals of friendship scholarship and service and has spread that mission throughout chapters in the United States and Canada PERIOD",The history of Sigma Alpha Epsilon â€“ The Crimson White,University of Alabama
