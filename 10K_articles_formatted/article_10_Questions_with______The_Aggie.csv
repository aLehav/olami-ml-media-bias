Editors note In order to shed some light on its day to day operations The Aggie talked to its own Jon Gold this week PERIOD The managing editor is a senior political science and international relations double major PERIOD



 What exactly does being managing editor entail

The managing editor has many different roles at the Aggie PERIOD The most prominent aspect would be deciding the placement of stories on the front page of the paper PERIOD I hire writers for the paper and read over all articles and columns before a paper is actually produced PERIOD Also as with all desk editors I am part of the editorial board PERIOD We meet four times a week during the school year to collectively author the editorials that appear on the opinion page every Tuesday and Thursday PERIOD



 So in terms of day to day tasks whats the first one you have to do once you walk in the door

Once I get in I turn on my computer PERIOD While I wait Ill pick up the dummy PERIOD This set of papers shows me where in the next days Aggie ads will be PERIOD I use this to decide which articles go on which pages and where we can place color photos PERIOD



 Whats the most difficult task you have to do

Handling all of the personnel aspects of the Aggie PERIOD Although interviewing and hiring writers is very rewarding it takes a fair amount of time PERIOD Other aspects of personnel such as discipline are rather unpleasant as well as time consuming PERIOD





 What made you apply to be managing editor

I wanted to have more of an impact at the Aggie PERIOD Previously when I was working at night I felt as though a lot of things were out of my control PERIOD Now I feel like I have an impact on the day to day production of the Aggie which is very satisfying PERIOD





 One aspect of your job is the Daily Calendar PERIOD How does someone get an event into the Daily Calendar What kind of information should they provide

People can either stop by  Lower Freeborn and fill out a slip or email dailycalcaliforniaaggie.com PERIOD Providing the date time location and a short description are the four things that are most useful PERIOD However the more information the better





 What would you say to people thinking about writing for The Aggie that are reading this interview

Apply Were always looking for more writers especially for the upcoming school year PERIOD I see the Aggie as a place for people to learn so lacking experience is not an issue PERIOD Just stop by  Lower Freeborn and pick up an application or email managingcaliforniaaggie.com with any questions PERIOD



 Your previous job at The Aggie was night editor but I think more people would know you as Jon Gold the Weatherman PERIOD Where did you get your inspiration for the daily weather quips

When I first took over the job I was concerned that I wouldnt have anything to say PERIOD The previous weatherperson suggested that I get a small notebook to jot ideas down PERIOD Although I did get one most of my ideas were just inspired by the awkwardness that is my daily life PERIOD



 What would the weather for tomorrow be if you were still writing them

Wow what a question PERIOD Lets go for Looks like the weather should be clear tomorrow with a high of  PERIOD Over the weekend I saw a colony of  or  rabbits by Hickey Gym PERIOD Although I tried to catch them under my backpack the little rascals moved much too quickly PERIOD Ill catch you you pesky wabbit



 How is managing editor a position that will help you in future careers

So many different skills come together in managing editor  personnel editing managing writers and editors  that I feel Ive already learned a lot in my first six weeks I think supervising the production of all news articles and working with people during stressful deadlines will be valuable things to experience PERIOD



 So where do you get your news

I read the New York Times daily PERIOD Im especially a fan of Sundays Week in Review section PERIOD I also read the Sacramento Bee and San Francisco Chronicle online relatively frequently PERIOD For my bitter and sarcastic political news I am an avid reader of wonkette.com PERIOD I think that about covers it PERIOD
