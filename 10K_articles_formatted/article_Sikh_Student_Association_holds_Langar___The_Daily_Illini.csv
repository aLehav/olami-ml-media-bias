A Langar or Free Kitchen a central aspect of Sikhism is a traditional gathering where people come together to share in a communal meal PERIOD

This is the first University Langar held on a campus in the Midwest region PERIOD Members from the Chicago Sikh and Danville community helped in creating the Langar PERIOD



All of the food was made by volunteers and without their time and effort this would not be possible said Amrita Bamrah vice president of SSA and junior in LAS PERIOD

By  p.m PERIOD the volunteers ran out of food PERIOD Simran Sandhu treasurer of SSA and junior in LAS said that as a result of the success more students on campus are more aware of the Sikh religion PERIOD

The main purpose of the Langar is to show who we are not who we are perceived to be and to spread awareness of discrimination and foster equality and acceptance she said PERIOD

Since  many in the Sikh community face discrimination and fall victim to hate crimes Sandhu said PERIOD In wake of the Boston bombings the SSA is aiming to prevent the same discrimination by raising awareness and hosting events similar to the Langar PERIOD

There have been small scale hate crimes in Boston against Muslim women PERIOD Even though were different religions theres a solidarity between us because we face the same discrimination Sandhu said PERIOD Theres a huge problem in the media we are misrepresented and seen as terrorists just because we are different  we are good people. amrutha Prasad an attendant of the event and freshman in LAS shared similar views PERIOD

The discrimination Sikhs face has definitely gone up since  PERIOD Also this Langar increased awareness and let the community know who Sikhs are she said PERIOD
