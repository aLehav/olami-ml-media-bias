by  Tyler GiesekePublished  September  

Zinue Cisneros said he used the University of Minnesotas free Gopher Chauffeur service nearly every weekend as a freshman to get back to Bailey Hall in St PERIOD Paul PERIOD

The actuarial mathematics and computer science sophomore said he would wait a very long time to get picked up  sometimes as long as two hours PERIOD

To cut down on wait times the Gopher Chauffeur is adding an extra vehicle to its fleet beginning this school year PERIOD With more drivers out picking up students employees said the new arrangement should better serve growing student demand PERIOD

We will be much more efficient said Julie Sanem the Gopher Chauffeurs advisor and director of health promotion for Boynton Health Service PERIOD

The Minnesota Student Association established the Gopher Chauffeur program in  to give students a safe free transportation option on the weekends Sanem said PERIOD Students can call in between  p.m PERIOD and  a.m PERIOD Friday and Saturday to get picked up PERIOD

The program leases vehicles through the University Sanem said PERIOD Currently drivers use two 12person vans and a Chevrolet Tahoe SUV offering  total seats for riders PERIOD

But the leasing service is discontinuing the vans she said so theyll be replaced with three sevenperson minivans by late September or early October PERIOD Combined with the SUV that change will lower the total number of seats to  PERIOD

Psychology sophomore Alex Urshan said the new situation seemed odd because of the lower number of seats PERIOD

Its kind of a weird tradeoff she said adding that more cars still seemed like a good idea since the Chauffeur gets backed up with requests PERIOD

As long as she has a warm place to wait though Urshan said the wait times dont bother her very much PERIOD

Im just glad we have it she said PERIOD

The Gopher Chauffeur rarely gets pickup requests from large groups Sanem said so fewer of seats shouldnt be a
problem PERIOD

The Student Services Fee Committee funded the fourth vehicle last spring semester PERIOD The program was granted a budget of about  for the  academic year  an increase of about  from the year before PERIOD

Through the fee each student will pay . for the Chauffeur each semester this year PERIOD

Dramatic growth in demand

The Chauffeur has given rides to an increasing number of students each year since Boynton began keeping track PERIOD

For  the Chauffeur gave  rides according to Boynton records PERIOD Last academic year the number was just less than  PERIOD

Sanem attributes the growth in ridership to a greater student awareness of the program PERIOD

For example many crime alerts sent to all students at the University recommend that they take the Gopher Chauffeur home for added safety she said PERIOD

It seems like every year more people learn about it student driver and psychology senior Tim Garay said PERIOD

And student interest in the Chauffeur is still increasing PERIOD

During the first three weekends of  the Chauffeur has serviced about  more riders than duting the same weekends last year according to Boynton records PERIOD

Even with the extra minivan Sanem said itll be tough to serve all interested students PERIOD

Im not sure that we will ever fully meet demand she said PERIOD

Studentdriven

The Gopher Chauffeur is staffed by student employees PERIOD

Students drive the vans answer phone calls from customers and help drivers with navigation PERIOD Linguistics senior Henry Wahl a Gopher Chauffeur employee said he usually answers calls at dispatch PERIOD

When he tells other people about his job Wahl said they often express sympathy because he sometimes works with intoxicated customers PERIOD

Although employees have to deal with drunk students Wahl said most of the students he works with are friendly PERIOD

Theyre almost always really appreciative he said PERIOD Its really fun. one of the more difficult duties of a dispatch worker is estimating how long to tell students theyll have to wait to be picked up Wahl said PERIOD

Its really hard to tell he said PERIOD We literally are totally guessing. sanem said student employees go through a driving record check firstaid training and CPR certification but theres no driving test for employees PERIOD

The new minivans will likely offer safer smoother drives and better gas mileage Wahl said PERIOD

They wont look like creeper vans he said PERIOD
