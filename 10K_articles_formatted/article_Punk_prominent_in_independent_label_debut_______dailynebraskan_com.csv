Screeching WeaselPanic Button RecordsGrade A

 is a debut of sorts for Chicagobased punk band Screeching Weasel butnot for a major label PERIOD

With new band members and their newly created record label called Panic Button Ben Weaseland company can finally concentrate on their music instead of the politics involved withthe industry PERIOD

As always the band takes on engaging issues on the latest EP and it only takes six songs and  minutes for Weasel to get his points across PERIOD

Some of these issues include why records are better than CDs  the problem racism poses to our society  and how much Weasel despisespeople in general  PERIOD

The second track  is a good representation of what owning your own record label is all about PERIOD On it Weasel sings 

 has all of the characteristics of a punkrock album short songs that are fastpaced and contain a lot of swear words PERIOD Screeching Weasel is still the same nononsense offensive band it always was only now it has no one to answer to but itself PERIOD
