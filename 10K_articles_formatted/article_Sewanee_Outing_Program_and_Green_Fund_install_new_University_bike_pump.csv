As many students have noticed there is an exciting new addition to Sewanees campus outside of McClurg PERIOD The Sewanee Outing Program SOP has set up a new bike pump to replace the older smaller one that had been there previously PERIOD This new pump was the product of a project proposed by John Benson and Seth Burns who run the SOP and funded by the Green Fund PERIOD

According to Diego Martinez Rojas C19 the SOP  placed a bike pump outside of McClurg which has been there for years but it wasnt really made for such heavy use. this industrialgrade pump which has finally been installed outside McClurg is meant to encourage increased biking around campus and as a result reduced car use which we believe is both good for the environment and potentially for student wellbeing as well continued Martinez Rojas PERIOD

As a result members of the SOP had the idea to install a more durable and easytouse pump for Sewanee students and the greater campus community PERIOD In order to do so they applied for funding from the Green Fund PERIOD

The Green Fund is a  studentled initiative begun by Katherine Wilkinson C05 PERIOD According to the Green Funds Engage page The University accepted the Green Fee proposal and allotted  from each students tuition payment to a Green Fund that was used at the time to purchase Renewable Energy Credits REC from the Tennessee Valley Authority through the Green Power Switch program. the project was approved and the new pump was installed for good the first week of April PERIOD This new bike pump can be found by the bike racks outside McClurg dining hall and is ready for use PERIOD

This new project is exciting as an improvement to Sewanees campus giving students an increased opportunity to bike and making simple bike repair more accessible PERIOD

Providing students a reliable high quality pump at a central high traffic location on campus supports Sewanees being a very bikeable and walkable campus. martinez Rojas said PERIOD This is an important step towards a more environmentally friendly campus. this project is the result of the hard work and dedication of the SOP but also evidence of the hard work and dedication of the Green Fund and its members PERIOD

As a lot of people know this is the first year for this organization Rojas said so they really did a lot of work and planning to make it happen PERIOD The committee members were devoted to this project so we hope to continue watching the fund grow get more applications and continue supporting more environmental action on campus.",Sewanee Outing Program and Green Fund install new University bike pump,University of the South
