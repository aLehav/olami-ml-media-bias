9336,2018-03-20,"pride is defined as a high or inordinate opinion of ones own dignity importance merit or superiority whether as cherished in the mind or as displayed in bearing conduct etc according to www.dictionary.com PERIOD Pride is something that in my opinion takes time to build up PERIOD This month is Pride Month at Rider University  pride in being a homosexual human being in the year  PERIOD Many people are proud to call themselves gay bisexual or lesbian in todays society PERIOD Yet there are people who struggle with coming out and being proud of who they are PERIOD Coming out is not as easy as it seems to many people who do not understand the process PERIOD
Since I can remember I was always attracted to the same sex men PERIOD This started when I was about five years old PERIOD A time when boys usually start realizing they like girls was the time when I was realizing that I liked boys PERIOD I knew that being attracted to the same sex was wrong. i dated a few girls back in grammar school nothing serious PERIOD Once I got to middle school I was picked on a lot by my peers PERIOD Everyone could tell I was gay because I hung out with all the girls PERIOD To stop this teasing I started dating one of my good female friends PERIOD When we broke up I started being more intimate with girls because I wanted to fit in and be normal. when high school hits as we all know things can get worse PERIOD My first two years of high school were great PERIOD I made many friends and felt a sort of acceptance PERIOD However I was not happy with myself PERIOD Since middle school I would always wish to be straight or normal before I would go to bed PERIOD It came to a point where I thought that being dead was better since I felt that God didnt love me and neither would my parents for being gay PERIOD
Yet there came a point in my life around the age of  when I decided that there was nothing wrong with me PERIOD I realized that being gay is not a big deal and is normal PERIOD I finally came out fully when I was a junior in high school PERIOD To my shock everyone was very supportive PERIOD Everyone at school still said Hi to me and treated me even better than before PERIOD To this day I thank God for giving me such a great life filled with supportive and openminded people PERIOD A year later I came out to my parents which was the scariest moment of my life but to my surprise again they were and still are very supportive of me and of course love me just as much as they did before PERIOD It has been about five years since I fully came out and I can honestly say that I do not regret it one bit PERIOD My moms response to me being gay was surprisingly funny I always knew you were gay honey PERIOD I was just waiting for you to come to terms with it. all this time I was struggling with my sexuality and accepting myself when she knew all along PERIOD
I am a much happier person now that I am out PERIOD Living a double life is not something that someone should put themself through just because of their sexual orientation PERIOD If you want acceptance from society you have to accept yourself completely first PERIOD Coming out is a process that takes people many years but trust me when I say that you feel so clean light and great about yourself PERIOD Furthermore once you come out you will feel what it truly means to feel pride as a homosexual human being in the year  PERIOD
