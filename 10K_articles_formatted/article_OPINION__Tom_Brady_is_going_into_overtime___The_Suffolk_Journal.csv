372,2016-06-08,"just because Tom Brady unretired doesnt mean his talent did too PERIOD His third season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is laced with bad luck PERIOD

The Bucs have fallen to five losses this season which is a new low for the GOAT PERIOD On top of that he and Gisele Bndchen have recently split up PERIOD

When the team isnt making Brady look good he lets them know hes unhappy PERIOD He has now broken two Microsoft Surface NFL tablets in fits of frustration and has also yelled at his offensive line PERIOD

Brady tricked us all by announcing his retirement in February only to return  days later PERIOD

Weve got a hell of a team Im still feeling pretty good and an arm is a terrible thing to waste said Brady in a TikTok video PERIOD

If Brady is still feeling pretty good his team shouldnt be at five losses and he wouldnt be using his arm that hes so afraid of wasting on damaging NFL property PERIOD

The problem is that Brady has been thinking about football for the past  years of his life PERIOD Ending his legendary career and having to think about anything else and move on is a terrifying thought for him PERIOD So if hes physically able to push that feat off for a little while longer then why not

Even if that means having to end his marriage PERIOD

You focus at work when its time to work and then when you come home you focus on the priorities that are at home PERIOD All you can do is the best you can do PERIOD Thats what Ill just continue to do as long as Im working and as long as Im being a dad he said to Jim Gray in their podcast Lets Go

In the week two Bucs versus New Orleans Saints game they were only down by three in the second quarter when Brady started yelling at them on the sidelines PERIOD

He also started an argument on the field midgame but when it turned physical he walked away PERIOD The fight led to his teammate Mike Evans getting ejected from the game according to ESPN PERIOD

He couldnt even get through week two of his twenty-third NFL season before erupting PERIOD

The whole world has its eyes on him as he deals with a divorce that his love for football evidently caused PERIOD Hes crumbling under the pressure PERIOD

While Brady has definitely worked extremely hard to get himself to the position he is at today he is starting to ruin his image tremendously with his behavior PERIOD His entitlement is starting to outweigh his talent PERIOD

He shouldnt have come back it was his time to retire PERIOD When he left the Pats and Bill Belichick behind he proved to football fans everywhere that he doesnt need Belichick in order to succeed PERIOD He won a Super Bowl with the Bucs in his first season in Florida PERIOD

If he continued his retirement he wouldve left the NFL while everyone still thought of him as the prodigious Brady he was for the majority of his career PERIOD But now when he leaves people will most likely remember the man he became in his third season with the Bucs PERIOD

But that would just make too much sense for Brady and as we all know by now the last thing he is is predictable PERIOD

Brady is still the GOAT Greatest Of All Time but he is also an old goat the high school hero whos still living on the glory days while the rest of us have gotten on with our lives said Dan Shaughnessy in a Boston Globe article PERIOD

Brady has proved everything there is left to prove PERIOD He has seven rings he has records that are nearly impossible to break and he has even divorced one of the highest paid models in the world for football PERIOD

There isnt much more for Brady to do PERIOD He will forever be known as the GOAT of the NFL but his time of setting timeless records is up PERIOD
