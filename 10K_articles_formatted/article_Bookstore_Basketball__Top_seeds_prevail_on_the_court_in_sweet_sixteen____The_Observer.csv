Dan Murphy and Greg Arbogast  Friday April  

It was business as usual for U Got a Bad Draw as the top seed defeated the Marksmen  Thursday at the Bookstore courts PERIOD

The Marksmen the last unranked team remaining in the tournament put up a good fight early but could not contend with the size of Bad Draw PERIOD

Bad Draw towered over the competition and used its power to drive the lane PERIOD The Marksmen had to foul early and often and soon found themselves in trouble PERIOD Bad Draw big man David Fitzgerald five points five rebounds was 3for3 on free throw attempts and Chris Devitt added one more from the line PERIOD Devitt led all scorers on the game with eight points PERIOD

Jay Morris led the Marksmen with three baskets PERIOD The team had trouble hitting shots early despite creating scoring opportunities to stay in the game PERIOD The Marksmen trailed by seven at the half PERIOD

They were a pretty good team  they hung with us for a while said Bad Draws Brady Quinn who had four in the winning effort PERIOD

Quinn and Chinedum Ndukwe looked for the big play throughout the game  the two attempted two alleyoops but were unable to connect on both PERIOD Ndukwe also had a chance to end the game with an exclamation point but his dunk attempt rimmed out and went out of bounds PERIOD

He can get it there Quinn said PERIOD We are all just a little tired right now from lifting and running. the game highlights all came from Marksmens undersized guard George Fisher PERIOD Fishers 5foot6 frame took a beating as he fearlessly stepped in the lane to take charges from Ndukwe and the 293pound Fitzgerald PERIOD Fisher also managed to tie up the senior offensive lineman at one point  earning a jump ball for the Marksmen PERIOD

He showed a lot of heart out there hes been doing that throughout the whole tournament teammate Dan Djondo said PERIOD

Fisher finished with two points and Djondo added two of his own PERIOD

We were happy with the performance overall Djondo said PERIOD Hopefully we will be able to come back next year and earn ourselves a seed. u Got a Bad Draw now moves on to the Elite Eight only three victories away from collecting its second title in three years PERIOD

No PERIOD  Clover Ridge  No PERIOD  Roccos Pizza 

Despite tallying  points Brendon Collins could not lead Roccos into the Elite Eight as it fell to Clover Ridge  Thursday at the Bookstore courts PERIOD

Collins scored four of the first five baskets for Roccos and remained hot throughout the contest PERIOD He was helped by teammates Kern Creevey three points and forward Chris Cavanaugh who added two PERIOD

But the bigger and stronger Clover Ridge team passed the ball with ease spreading around the offense as all five players dropped multiple baskets PERIOD

The team used its size as an advantage as it was able to get to the foul line nine times PERIOD John Carlson led the team hitting two free throws on five attempts PERIOD He had seven points in all PERIOD

The difference in the game was John Carlson  his monster play and hustle led us to victory teammate Pat Devitt said PERIOD

Devitt a Zahm freshman had two buckets and his brother Ed added five more PERIOD The siblings provided a height advantage and worked themselves into the key against Roccos defenders PERIOD

I thought we played them pretty tough Roccos guard John Paul Lichon said PERIOD They were a big team. roccos was able to keep the game close but couldnt hit the big shot to take the lead PERIOD Creevey played well down the stretch hitting two jumpers from behind the arc PERIOD But Clover Ridges Paul Hagan answered with his own deep basket to ice the game and push his team to the Elite Eight PERIOD

No PERIOD  Mean Girls  No PERIOD  Saltines 

With a vicious putback dunk Pete Courtney finished off No PERIOD  Saltines  victory over No PERIOD  Mean Girls and sent his team through to the final eight with an exclamation point PERIOD

While Courtneys dunk brought down the house it was his freshman teammate point guard Carl Andersen who was the crowd favorite throughout the night PERIOD Displaying a variety of inside moves as well as a delicate outside touch Andersen led the Saltines with seven points PERIOD

The only freshman member of the team Andersen played much older PERIOD It was clear that the Saltines were his to lead  and team members said they are thankful they were able to discover their star point guard PERIOD

I played against him a couple of times at Rolfs and we really needed a point guard so we asked him to play with us sophomore Chris Lund said PERIOD Hes better than some D1 players I know PERIOD Were just glad to have him. it was not just Andersen however who contributed on Thursday night as all five Saltines scored at least two points PERIOD In addition to some fluid ball movement that led to several easy layups the Saltines were able to get inside the whole game through their big men Courtney Lund and Brent Locey PERIOD

Our style is impetuous and our defense is impregnable sophomore Dan Ott said PERIOD Were nasty. while the final score indicated a lopsided victory the game was close throughout much of the evening PERIOD After Mean Girls Nick Ortizs layup cut the deficit to  the Saltines went on an  run capped off by Courtneys dunk PERIOD

The bigger problem for the Mean Girls came earlier in the game when they were unable to capitalize on some beneficial foul calls PERIOD After an aggressive style of play put the Mean Girls in the bonus with the score only at  the Mean Girls were unable to take advantage as they went  of  from the charity stripe for the rest of the half PERIOD

Those are free points and youve got to capitalize on those Mean Girls guard Alex Klupchak said PERIOD
