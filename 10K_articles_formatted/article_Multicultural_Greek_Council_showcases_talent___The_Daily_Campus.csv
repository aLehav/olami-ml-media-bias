Students shuffled down the aisles of HughesTrigg Theater around  p.m casually anticipating the night to come PERIOD

The SMU MGC showcase is an opportunity for students to get to know the fraternities and sororities and network PERIOD

Its just all fun Abel Saenz prospective member educator for Omega Delta Phi said PERIOD We just do it to get together as a group and bond. by  p.m PERIOD the audience chatter fell silent under the word of MC Guadalupe Sanchez PERIOD

Straight man Sanchez played off firecracker Angela Uno onstage tossing quips back and forth to warm the crowd up PERIOD

The five fraternities and sororities wowed the crowd with their tight dance routines and loose humor PERIOD

Fraternities Omega Delta Phi and Sigma Lambda Beta machoed out the crowd with their powerful steps and throaty chants PERIOD

One memorable moment was when Saenz evoked Hulk Hogan in a faux wrestling promotional video flexing his muscles and growling incoherently to the
crowds delight PERIOD

The sororities kept the energy going with their fluid choreography PERIOD

Kappa Delta Chi earned applause for their 50s inspired dance jitters PERIOD

energy performances PERIOD

Throughout the show audience members cheered the dancers on with oohs and Ah I see

The meeting soon gave way to more dancing thanks to DJ Lucky mixing salsa radio hits and the campus inexplicable favorite Wobble by V.I.C PERIOD
