In May Teresa Tuan broke a record by becoming the youngest person to graduate in the Us history PERIOD

She however may not be going too far PERIOD At  Tuan does not yet have a drivers license PERIOD

I turned  in April which was right in the middle of gearing down for finals and finishing my thesis so I was insanely busy said Tuan who graduated in chemistry PERIOD I do have a learners permit though. as to how she got around campus during her college career Tuan credits her mother for giving her rides to and from school when she wasnt walking or taking the shuttles PERIOD

Tuan said she made it a point to never tell people how old she was unless they asked her directly PERIOD

Age has only been an issue when I wasnt old enough to drive drink or go clubbing she said PERIOD My social life has honestly been hurt more by living off campus than it has by being so young. if anything Tuans age has only been a running joke with friends PERIOD

Ted Eyring professor in chemistry said that Tuan was in his classroom for a week or more before someone pointed out her age PERIOD

What drew my attention was that she was one of only three or four students in a class of  who solved a moderately difficult integral calculus problem on a midterm exam Eyring said PERIOD

Tuan graduated from the U at  by skipping a grade in elementary school and essentially skipping high school PERIOD

Tuan enrolled in classes at Salt Lake Community College during seventh grade PERIOD She continued taking concurrent enrollment classes at SLCC until she graduated from West High School with an associates degree in chemistry in  PERIOD

Despite her accelerated education Tuan says that the only thing she has missed is having more free time PERIOD

I always had a major and a path so I never got time to just fool around she said in regard to her education PERIOD

Tuan who delivered the  commencement address at the Huntsman Center in May spoke about U students and the pursuit of their passions PERIOD

It isnt simply that they love what they do Tuan said to the rest of her graduating class PERIOD Passion is more than love PERIOD Passion is love that moves. tuan said her passion is working with people PERIOD

Its a bit unorthodox but I love being around people and understanding how we are different and how our differences impact the way we treat one another Tuan said PERIOD Im fascinated by how we explore and form our own identities and how we use different methods to express and interpret our experiences. thinking about issues that manage to cut across the many selfconstructed barriers our society haslike health or racehelps Tuan to explore her own identity PERIOD

Finding her own identity would not have been possible without the help of Kari Ellingson assistant vice president of student affairs Tuan said PERIOD

I cannot imagine where I would be without her as my compass she said PERIOD

Ellingson said that Tuans varied interests caught her attention before her age PERIOD

She enjoys debate is an accomplished classical pianist loves service to the community and works in the Capecchi human genetics lab Ellingson said PERIOD Shes also just a very nice person to be around. she said that she was not an advocate of students of a young age doing what Tuan has done. there is so much that can be missed when we rush through childhood Ellingson said PERIOD

Tuan however definitely has a mature and thoughtful approach to her future that other students could learn from Ellingson added PERIOD

In the future Tuan plans to go into pediatrics or public health at a national level PERIOD

At  years old chemistry major Teresa Tuan recently became the youngest person ever to have graduated from the U PERIOD
