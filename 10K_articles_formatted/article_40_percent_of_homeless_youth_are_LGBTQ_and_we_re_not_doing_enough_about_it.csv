Parents have kicked their gay and transgender kids out of their homes due to lack of acceptance intolerance bigotry and hate on countless occasions PERIOD These kids are then forced to move from place to place they couch surf stay with different relatives and sleep in their cars on the train or on the streets PERIOD

The LGBTQA community is disproportionately represented in the population of homeless youth in the United States PERIOD According to the organizationAmerican Progressthere is approximately . to . million homeless youth currently and  to  percent of this population identifies as LGBTQA PERIOD That is equivalent to about  to  gay and transgender youth facing homelessness every year PERIOD

Realistically thesestatistics are most likely just a representation of the many more homeless LGBTQA youth that go unreported PERIOD These youth move from place to place without a steady place they can call home and thus go undocumented PERIOD

The National Coalition for the Homelessreports that LGBTQA homeless youth are . times more likely to experience sexual violence than heterosexual homeless youth PERIOD LGBTQA homeless youth also commit suicide atmuch higher rates than heterosexual homeless youth  percent compared to  percent PERIOD

The United States Interagency Council on Homelessnessstates that because youth are coming out atearlier ages than in the past at ages  rather than  they are experiencing homelessness at higher rates PERIOD If they are unsupported by family members they are either kicked out or they run away PERIOD Unsupported with nowhere to go they drop out of school and end up in shelters foster care or on the streets PERIOD

Forced out of their homes due to not being accepted LGBTQA homeless youth often find it difficult to feel comfortable in homeless shelters and foster care as well PERIOD Usually discriminated against because of religious reasons LGBTQA homeless youth are often turned off from religiously based homeless shelters that have bibles sitting on tables PERIOD

An example of one of these religious based organizations is Seattles Union Gospel Mission PERIOD On their About Us page it reads Seattles Union Gospel Mission provides emergency care and longterm recovery services to hurting and homeless people in the greater Seattle area PERIOD Were dedicated to serving rescuing and transforming those in greatest need through the grace of Jesus Christ. so if you want to have a bed to sleep in you have to accept Lord Jesus Christ as your savior PERIOD In order to stay at the Union Gospel Mission you have to attend church and become transformed. this does not seem to be the most welcoming environment to the homeless LGBTQA youth PERIOD

The same goes for the homeless LGBTQ youth of Chicago PERIOD

According to the organization Project Fierce Chicago there are currently  homeless youth in Chicago and  individuals of that population identify as LGBTQ PERIOD For these  youth there are a total of  beds in the city of Chicago in permanent and transitional housing PERIOD

Only  beds for  homeless kids in the city PERIOD

All of these facts lead to one conclusion not enough is being done to combat this issue PERIOD Not enough people know about this issue PERIOD Not enough people care about this issue PERIOD

The first step is to become aware PERIOD The next step is to become involved PERIOD
