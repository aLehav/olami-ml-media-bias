Elenore  The Turtles

All hail Hallmark

Valentines Day is in two weeks and people are abuzz with what theyre getting their sweetie PERIOD Personally I think the holidays way overdone PERIOD To diffuse such mushy talk Im cranking Elenore by The Turtles PERIOD

Elenore gee I think youre swell  And you really do me well  Youre my pride and joy etcetera goes the chorus in all of its infectiousyetcheeky glory PERIOD Not only does it keep me from turning all Grinch this PDA Day but helps me be a good sport in honor of Cupid PERIOD Besides who can stay cranky while listening to music from the 60s Paint a peace sign on your face man and enjoy carefree rock n roll where everything was peace and love etcetera PERIOD

I wont be buying my Valentines Day paraphernalia for at least another week PERIOD Until then Elenore will keep me sane PERIOD
