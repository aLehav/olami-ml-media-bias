Add Jabarie Hinds to the growing list of transfer guards who have chosen to join the Massachusetts mens basketball team over recent years PERIOD

Hinds a 5foot11 guard who appeared in all  games for West Virginia last season announced on Thursday that he will transfer to the Minutemen PERIOD The decision was first reported by Adam Zagoria of SNY.tv PERIOD

Due to NCAA transfer rules Hinds will have to sit out next season but he is allowed to practice with the team once hes enrolled PERIOD Hell suit up for the Minutemen starting in the  season PERIOD

Hinds is the third guard in the last four years to transfer to UMass PERIOD Chaz Williams transferred from Hofstra in  and Derrick Gordon transferred from Western Kentucky last year PERIOD

I gained a good relationship with UMass coach Derek Kellogg and I felt thats the best place for me Hinds said to SNY.tv on Thursday PERIOD

Hinds a former fourstar and top  recruit coming out of high school averaged . points and . assists per game last season for the Mountaineers although it wasnt enough to help the team avoid a losing record PERIOD Hinds also started the first  games of the season before losing the starting job later in the year PERIOD

On April  Hinds announced he would be leaving WVU to pursue playing somewhere else PERIOD Last week he narrowed his selections down to UMass and Atlantic  rival Saint Josephs before ultimately picking the Minutemen on Thursday PERIOD

With Williams graduating after next season Hinds will likely play a large part in a backcourt rotation that will also include Gordon and Trey Davis in  all of whom will have two years eligibility remaining at that point PERIOD
