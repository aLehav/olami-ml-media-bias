Students arent feeling like they are able to enjoy their breaks PERIOD Students are facing an overwhelming amount of stress that school has brought upon them with their workload in the classes they are taking PERIOD During Thanksgiving Break for example a majority of students were busy with assignments during break instead of being able to relax PERIOD Having assignments due during break has become more common since most classes are virtual rather than inperson PERIOD

Michael Anderson a freshman at Sonoma State explains how he found school chewing up most of his time during Thanksgiving Break PERIOD When relaying what he had to face during his socalled break Anderson explains how ...many of my teachers still had assignments due that week Thanksgiving Break and a couple even had exams scheduled right when got back from our break. anderson makes further comments about his struggles stating With the pressure of exams right after break I felt like I spent most of my time studying instead of being able to hang out with my family which is not a way to spend a holiday break PERIOD

Most classes that are currently are still being offered only in a virtual setting PERIOD There are very few classes that have been brought back completely inperson PERIOD The virtual style of learning has brought on more assignments and work for students to complete leading to assignments being given out during holiday breaks like Spring Break and Thanksgiving Break PERIOD

Across the U.S PERIOD this year school districts across the highmiddle school setting have extended students Thanksgiving Break PERIOD This comes after many teachers and school board members saw the common themes of students experiencing signs of stress PERIOD In regards to such events Superintendent of Detroit Public Schools Community District DPSCD Nikolai P PERIOD Vitti decided to extend Thanksgiving Break for students PERIOD Vitti reasoned with the following statement  ...reflecting on the concerns of schoolbased leaders teachers support staff students and families regarding the need for mental health relief rising COVID cases and time to more thoroughly clean schools. seeing this happen is great and all for the younger students it gives them the chance to unwind but how about the college students At least within Sonoma State University the board shouldve thrown students a bone and extended the Thanksgiving Break this year even if it was for a few days PERIOD A students mental health is far more important than getting assignments done PERIOD Schools at the college level should make it a priority in looking out for students mental health especially in this day in age learning within a pandemic PERIOD There should not only be an extension to holiday breaks to make students ease up from their workload but there should be more holidays regarding student wellness giving students added time off of school to relieve stress PERIOD

As the new semester rolls around the corner so does the return of inperson instruction within Sonoma State and many other schools PERIOD This could be the beginning of the improvement for students mental health as they would finally be able to have a less workload then semesters past. though with the option of inperson classes more widely available would this mean students would be able to relax a little more during this upcoming Winter Break

I dont know if I will be able to completely relax during this Winter Break was a remark made by Jason Altamirano a senior at SSU PERIOD Being a major within Business Administration Altamirano explained how he had to do a lot of preparation both for school and mentally due to a majority of his classes being online these past few semesters PERIOD When asked how he plans on thinking about the Spring semester for next year Altamirano states that During winter break I hope I will be able to work on my mental state a little bit so that next semester isnt as hard as this past semester has been. the last few semesters have definitely taken a toll on students like Anderson and Altamirano PERIOD With the holidays just right around the corner many wish for a break but arent sure if that is a realistic expectation PERIOD Many have seen a decline in their mental states as holidays come around not to mention students not feeling as if a holiday break is necessarily a break from school compared to the past few semesters PERIOD

Hopefully this Winter Break students will get the break they deserve and need PERIOD However many students have faced many difficulties these last semesters so not everyone is going to be able to catch the break they need PERIOD Its important for students to take this incoming Winter Break to unwind and take a deep breath as another tough semester has concluded PERIOD
