He had been a 197pounder on the Nebraska wrestling teams roster for two years but he sat out the first half of his sophomore season with a knee injury PERIOD By the time Johnson was set to return junior Caleb Kolb was holding his own at  pounds and the Nebraska coaches decided to move Johnson up a weight class PERIOD

They told Johnson on a Monday PERIOD

The Huskers had a meet the following Friday PERIOD

Even though Johnson was not accustomed to wrestling heavyweights he found one silver lining the week he started competing with wrestlers  pounds heavier than him PERIOD

Well Johnson said I didnt have to cut weight. half a year before Johnson became a heavyweight he was grappling with a teammate during a summer camp at the wrestling teams home in the Hendricks Center PERIOD

He wrapped his left leg around my right leg Johnson said and when we fell back down to the mat I felt a pop. torn ACL PERIOD

After winning  matches and six open tournaments over the span of his first two years with the Huskers Johnson would have to miss the front half of his sophomore campaign PERIOD

I know that I was further ahead than even where I am now Johnson said PERIOD Its always going to be difficult when you have an injury like this and then you always look back at where you were and youve just kind of got to put that behind you. as  turned into  and Johnson eyed his return to competition Nebraska coach Mark Manning and assistant coach Tony Ersland discussed moving Johnson from  pounds to the heavyweight class PERIOD

We just felt like we have two solid kids in Caleb and Spencer and to get them both in the lineup would be the best thing Ersland said PERIOD It kind of looked like heavyweight would be a place where he could handle it for us PERIOD He could shore up some things and add to the lineup. so during the second week of the new year Johnson began learning the dos and donts of his new weight class including work with former Nebraska wrestler Craig Brester  an assistant coach for the Huskers PERIOD

He gets the better of me most often Johnson said PERIOD He was No PERIOD  in the nation two years in a row and just runnerup to Jake Varner  and Varner was the Olympic champion PERIOD So Im not going to come up against anybody tougher than Craig. and even though Johnson is a long way from hitting the heavyweight limit of  pounds he makes up for it with his conditioning PERIOD

Hes strong PERIOD Hes in great shape PERIOD He moves his feet well better than most of these bigger guys Ersland said PERIOD He has to be inside with his positioning PERIOD He has to make sure hes coming off bottom strong PERIOD Its just a matter of staying in good position and then using his strengths like his conditioning moving his feet wearing on these guys to overcome some of those things. two weeks into his heavyweight stint Johnson has already found success wearing down his opponents PERIOD

When they get tired then they dont move as well Johnson said so I just smell blood and keep the pressure on them PERIOD Keep beating them even worse. four days after Spencer Johnson became a heavyweight his Huskers traveled to Ann Arbor Mich. for a dual with the Wolverines PERIOD His opponent 19thranked Ben Apland weighed about  pounds  more than  pounds heavier than Johnson PERIOD

Hes about  with a ham sandwich in him Manning said PERIOD Hes not real heavy but he wrestles heavier than he looks PERIOD He really uses his power and his strength to his advantage. apland defeated Johnson  but the next day Johnson beat Northwesterns Jacob Berkowitz  for his first heavyweight victory PERIOD

I dont think my conditioning was the best in my first match Johnson said PERIOD My conditionings just going to keep getting better. a week later the conditioning showed PERIOD

Johnson led Illinois Chris Lopez  entering the final period and he started the period on top PERIOD

And he stayed on top PERIOD

Thats my style Johnson said PERIOD You wear the kid out and beating on him thats my kind of brawling. he stayed on top until Lopez got a stalling penalty PERIOD He stayed on top until Lopez got tired and he could smell blood PERIOD He stayed on top until there were only eight seconds left and he won the match  bringing the NU Coliseum crowd to its feet because the victory clinched an  dual win against the No PERIOD  Fighting Illini PERIOD

Johnsons reaction I feel like I could have beat the kid worse. hes now  in his new weight class and Ersland praised the way Johnson took control of the Illinois match PERIOD

I think this was just a good positive experience for him to build on and move forward with Ersland said PERIOD Its still definitely a work in progress. johnson after all has only had two weeks to become a heavyweight PERIOD
