UC Davis football receives historic ranking as Fall Quarter begins

The UC Davis football team woke up to a nice surprise last Monday morning following the teams  dismantling of visiting Idaho over the weekend and a week off from game action wasnt the only thing to celebrate PERIOD In the latest top25 rankings released by Stats FCS the Aggies came in at No PERIOD  their highest position on the poll since the team moved up to the Division I level in  PERIOD UC Davis trails only two teams from the Big Sky conference Eastern Washington and Weber State PERIOD

The Aggies have enjoyed a  start to the season with convincing victories over FBS opponent San Jose State San Diego and Idaho a team that just moved down from the FBS level this year PERIOD The only blemish was a hardfought 20point loss to national powerhouse Stanford a top10 team in the nation and legitimate College Football Playoff contender PERIOD

This season the teams bye week perfectly coincides with the commencement of Fall Quarter giving Aggie football players the opportunity to get accustomed to their class schedules and the daily grind of keeping up with schoolwork and athletics PERIOD

The good thing about right now is that schools starting and they have a chance to focus on school and get off on a really great start said UC Davis head coach Dan Hawkins PERIOD I think thats a real positive for us. in addition to the benefits felt in the classroom the absence of a game at the end of the week gives players a chance to go home for a few days visit with friends and family and simply relax PERIOD

Itll give them time to go home and get some of moms home cooking Hawkins said PERIOD

The players wont have another window to leave campus for an extended period of time until the season concludes PERIOD

Well get three days of work in but theyll get a weekend off to be a normal person Hawkins said PERIOD We always talk about that quality balance of life and I think thats important. most players planned to return to their respective hometowns for a few days and many hoped to even catch their siblings in some football action PERIOD

Senior defensive back Isiah Olave who comes from a talented family of football players planned on traveling to watch his younger brother Josh a sophomore defensive back play at Azusa Pacific University PERIOD Olave was also excited to catch another game on TV featuring his youngest brother Chris a former fourstar wide receiver in high school and current true freshman at Ohio State PERIOD

Redshirt freshman Ulonzo Gilliam who leads UC Davis with  rushing yards and five touchdowns had similar plans to cheer on his younger brother Elijah at Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas Nevada PERIOD Gilliam couldnt wait to check out Bishop Gormans topnotch facilities including a massive stadium and stateoftheart  squarefoot training facility both of which are comparable to many bigtime universities PERIOD

No matter how the players chose to spend their time off it was a muchneeded break for the team given its success on the gridiron thus far PERIOD

This is perfect timing coming off a tough game Olave said PERIOD Its been a lot of groundandpound so far so this gives us a chance to make sure our bodies are healthy and sound PERIOD It lets us keep our momentum going into Northern Colorado. the Aggies have a tough journey ahead with three of their next four games on the road PERIOD They also have a brutal stretch to end the season by hosting Northern Arizona traveling to Eastern Washington and hosting Sacramento State in the Causeway Classic PERIOD The team will need all the rest it can get in hopes of advancing to the FCS playoffs at the end of November PERIOD
