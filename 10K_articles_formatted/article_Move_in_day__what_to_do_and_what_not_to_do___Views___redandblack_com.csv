Its that time of year again PERIOD You know the time where everyone and their mama and daddy and little brothers and older sisters maybe even aunts and uncles and grandparents  flood Athens to see their little angels off to college some for the first time some for the last time PERIOD Streets are packed with Uhauls and minivans overstuffed with students entire lives PERIOD

Parents drag their newly christened college freshmen through the aisles of Target Walmart and Kroger to make sure they have enough food to live off of for the next six months which will likely still be there when they move out in May thanks to the allyoucaneat meal plan and a dry erase board so people can leave messages on their dorm doors but it will likely just house a photo from Workaholics and penis doodles like mine did PERIOD

Much younger siblings cry as they havent eaten since leaving home that morning and their parents dont have time to find the local McDonalds between waiting for the elevator to the last floor of the highrises PERIOD

But its also the time when those who have been here the whole summer or more broadly the townies who live here yearround regardless of the academic calendar cower in their homes and stock up on groceries two weeks in advance as if another snowpocalypse was coming PERIOD

I like to think they call it the studentpocalypse PERIOD Or consider grocery shopping as some modern day  scene  except it would be more like  PERIOD

With the town brimming to the top with people  each one having an emotional stressful and busy day  Athens is already holding all of the drama it can take PERIOD The best way to make this a painless experience for all is to keep your head down your mind and actions focused and be respectful to all around you PERIOD Dont do anything superfluous on movein day PERIOD Just buy your necessities youll have a few days before classes start to find a friend with a car to take you to the store for coffee and popcorn PERIOD Only bring the necessary family members along and save emotional goodbyes for the appropriate places like your room or outside PERIOD Remember that everyone else is moving in too when deciding if your fivepound box of desk supplies qualifies you for a ride in the elevator while someone else is hauling a futon PERIOD

And last but not least remember that Athens exists even when youre not living here so be respectful of those that live here yearround  and more importantly  those working at the places you visit while moving in PERIOD

Its a hectic day or few weeks really so lets all work together to make the transition back into the school year as easy as possible PERIOD

Dorm life infamous as it is has become a rite of passage that every college student experiences PERIOD The mystery of the community bathrooms the tiny living space shared between two or more people and the inevitable strep throat one contracts within the first three months all come together to make one of the best and worst collegiate experiences PERIOD
