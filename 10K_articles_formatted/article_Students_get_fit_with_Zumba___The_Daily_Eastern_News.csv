I do Zumba as a hobby for fun because I love fitness Scholz said PERIOD

Scholz said in order to keep the class in Charleston she approached Dr PERIOD Brandon Combs board certified chiropractic physician at Park Hills Spa and Wellness Center about an open space for a Zumba class PERIOD Scholz talked to Combs and said he was excited about having the class at the spa PERIOD
