Morris Bart analyzed crash data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to determine the myriad causes behind traffic deaths in the U.S PERIOD

In  nearly  people were killed in traffic collisions in the United States PERIOD This represents a . percent increase over  and the most traffic deaths in a single year since  PERIOD

While its clear that U.S PERIOD roads have become increasingly more deadly in recent years what circumstances lead to fatal crashes Are there regional differences in how they occur

How exactly do people die in motor vehicle collisions

Morris Bart examined the latest available year of fatal crash data from the NHTSA to find answers PERIOD



As you might expect collisions with other vehicles are the most common cause of traffic deaths PERIOD Vehicle collisions killed over  people in  and accounted for  percent of all traffic deaths in the United States PERIOD

However while motor vehicle collisions were the most common single source the majority of traffic deaths   according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations FARS database  were caused by something else PERIOD

The NHTSA keeps  different objects or events that lead to fatal crashes PERIOD This data includes collisions with fixed objects like trees curbs or mailboxes incidents involving nonmotorists such as pedestrians or bicyclists and noncollision events such as vehicle rollovers PERIOD

Pedestrian crashes were the next closest cause accounting for  deaths followed by vehicle rollovers or overturns then collisions with trees PERIOD

Outside the top ten there were several interesting or surprising ways people die on the road

In all  states and the District of Columbia the most common cause of traffic deaths is either collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians PERIOD However if we remove these crashes some very interesting regional differences emerge PERIOD Seven different objects or events appear as the next most common cause in at least one state rollovers trees curbs ditches embankments bicycles and occupants falling or jumping from vehicles PERIOD

Vehicle rollovers and overturns Especially dangerous for large SUVs and trucks vehicle rollovers or overturns killed nearly  people in  PERIOD They were the most common type of crash in outside vehicle and pedestrian collisions in twenty states including Texas Colorado and Arizona PERIOD

Collisions with standing trees While treelined roads have been shown to lower average traffic speed and reduce the rate of headon collisions trees can be dangerous fixed objects in crashes PERIOD As the fifth most common cause of crash deaths overall collisions with standing trees took the lives of  people PERIOD Treerelated crashes were the most common cause of death in twenty states including most of the states along the East Coast PERIOD

Curbs While striking a curb may immediately bring visions of wheel damage to mind curbs can be dangerous fixed objects PERIOD In fact nearly  people were killed in traffic crashes caused by collisions with curbs PERIOD They were most common in four states  California Connecticut Massachusetts and New Jersey  and the District of Columbia PERIOD

Ditches Ditches are essential to road safety carrying rainwater away from the road and preventing them from flooding PERIOD However when motorists veer off the road and into a roadside ditch it can be disastrous PERIOD Just under  people died after their vehicles veered into a ditch and they were most common in three states  Iowa Louisiana and Ohio PERIOD

Embankments Embankments are raised structures used to hold back water or most commonly along highways and overpasses carry a roadway PERIOD Nearly  people died after striking an embankment along a roadway PERIOD Collisions with embankments were the leading cause of road deaths in one state  Kentucky PERIOD

Bicyclists In Florida collisions with bicyclists killed more people than any other type of collision outside those involving other vehicles or pedestrians PERIOD In fact  percent of all bicycle deaths  occurred in the state of Florida PERIOD

Fell or jumped from vehicle In Hawaii seven people died after falling or jumping from a moving vehicle accounting for seven percent of all traffic deaths in the state PERIOD

Below we list the most common events or objects that cause fatal crashes in the U.S. outside collisions with pedestrians and other vehicles PERIOD
