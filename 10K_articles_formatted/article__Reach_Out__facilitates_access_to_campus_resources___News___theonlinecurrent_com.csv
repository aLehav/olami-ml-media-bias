Mainly clear PERIOD Low near 60F PERIOD Winds NNE at  to  mph PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The Reach Out College Edition app first launched during Autumn Term was a way to acquaint Eckerds newest students to campus resources regarding sexual assault finding medical care and accessing support services PERIOD But after one semester of its establishment there are students that remain unfamiliar with it PERIOD

The app was introduced to Eckerd by Assistant Dean for Community Standards and Title IX Coordinator Lori MakinByrd who first heard of its success from another schools Title IX Coordinator PERIOD

According to capptivation.com four college graduates make up the team of developers that decided to designed the app after hearing that one in five women and one in  men will experience sexual assault before graduating from college PERIOD The developers provide the app for free to both users and the institution and customize it based on the schools resources PERIOD In addition to oncampus colleges the app can be specialized for off campus and high schools so that it can function as a resource for anyone in a student population to engage with PERIOD

Its an incredibly powerful thing to know that they have decided to do this because they think it matters Director of the Office for Advocacy and Gender Justice and Associate Chaplain Libby Shannon said PERIOD

According to MakinByrd one concern that could be a deterrent from downloading the app is people thinking their activity is being monitored PERIOD However the reporting system with the app is anonymous and only basic information is given out by the developers to the school such as the number of downloads and when they occur PERIOD The identity of app users therefore remains unknown unless they choose to take further action PERIOD

Senior Samantha Bingham also feels that there are no major reasons that would keep people from downloading and using Reach Out PERIOD

I think if we get the word out enough it will be successful Bingham said PERIOD I think people will be more likely to report through the app than through other means because its easier to access. although theres currently no data on how the introduction of the app has already impacted decision making when reporting Reach Out does provide a way to inform users about their options through something that is easy to setup and use PERIOD

My assumption however is that having more information available and having that information easily accessible increases knowledge of options and resources and therefore increases reporting as well MakinByrd said in an email PERIOD

Getting the word out about Reach Out to more than just the freshmen class during Autumn Term is currently a main goal in implementing improvements and continuing the conversation around sexual assault on campus PERIOD

Its kind of hard to think of a strategy to reach every single upperclassman in the way that you can with freshmen MakinByrd said PERIOD

In addition to the allcampus email sent about the apps launch and availability for both Apple and Android devices discussion of it during oncampus educational programs is a current initiative to expand awareness of the resource PERIOD

The app itself features various options for users and asserts that although there is no singular way to get help after experiencing sexual assault they do provide information for any stage that a survivor may find helpful PERIOD The Guide option on Reach Out offers an easy to understand list composed of different stages a survivor can seek help from PERIOD This includes going somewhere that is safe preserving any evidence and getting medical attention reporting options and recommendations for both physical and emotional healing processes PERIOD

According to Shannon Reach Out has also been helpful for personal injuries not relating to sexual assault thanks to the contact information provided within the app PERIOD

Additional features include prevention and education advocacy and support hotlines the Title IX survey and ways to get involved PERIOD
