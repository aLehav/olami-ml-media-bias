This past July at the Vans Warped Tour in West Palm Beach I was able to sit down with the drummer of The Maine Pat Kirch PERIOD The Maine hails from Tempe Arizona and just finished its set on the Warheads stage when we sat down with its members PERIOD They released their fourth album Forever Halloween on June   PERIOD However they recently rereleased a deluxe edition with new songs to satiate their fans thirst for music until the next full length album PERIOD After a whole summer with the Vans Warped Tour The Maine will be headed out on tour in Europe in support of the rerelease PERIOD

You guys are from Tempe Arizona PERIOD Whats the biggest difference between there and Miami

Pat The biggest thing is that each day we wake up early and make a sign that says what time were going to play PERIOD It was the most humid day of my entire life PERIOD I was just dripping with sweat PERIOD Phoenix is really hot but its not very humid PERIOD You walk off the bus and instantly sweat

You guys are releasing a new album

Pat Yeah we just did a couple weeks ago at the beginning of the tour PERIOD We put out a deluxe edition of Forever Halloween our most recent record with a bunch of extra tunes PERIOD

You guys recorded this differently than most bands using a live tape PERIOD How was that experience

Pat Yeah well basically it felt like playing a concert PERIOD It was the five of us in a room just playing PERIOD It was weird It was like generally we record the drums and then the guitars the bass and then the vocals and youre just sitting there concentrating on your individual part PERIOD It ends up sounding more of like a perfect song and there isnt much energy to it because youre not playing at the exact same time PERIOD It just gave a vibe to the record that we couldnt get it if we did it how we did our old albums PERIOD

What are the main differences with the new songs that didnt make it to the original release

Pat Some are just really old that we just didnt put on other records or were songs that weve been playing in concerts all the time and there are some that are completely new PERIOD So it was just a mixture of songs that we thought people would want to hear PERIOD

How was the decision making in rereleasing your album as opposed to releasing a separate EP

Pat The main reason we wanted to do it was being on the Warped Tour because we patched it through and sold it for five bucks PERIOD So you get  songs for five bucks as opposed to asking people if they wanted to buy our new record or our new EP PERIOD We just put it all together for five bucks if someone hears us for the first time on Warped Tour and for people who already have the record its only five bucks for the new songs PERIOD

What has been your experience on Warped Tour this year

Pat We havent been on Warped Tour since  PERIOD Its been great We really werent sure what to expect because weve been kind of away from this for so long so we werent sure if the people who come to Warped Tour would remember our band or care PERIOD Ive been blown away every day by how many people come and watch us and sing along PERIOD It couldnt have been a better time PERIOD

What are some bands that you go out of your way to see

Pat Finch PERIOD Theyre not on it anymore but I watched them a lot the first half PERIOD There are tons of bands that we could never tour with because the sound doesnt work on a club tour PERIOD Thats the coolest part is hanging out with bands we cant tour with PERIOD

What band would you like to tour with that you cant normally tour with

Pat The Word Alive PERIOD Theyre good buddies of ours from back home PERIOD We used to be in other bands together in high school PERIOD Its a little weird PERIOD

For you what song from the deluxe CD hit home the most

Pat It was a song called Ice Cave. thats the one weve played in concert for four years but we never recorded it PERIOD It just became a favorite a fans and theyd like bootleg versions of it PERIOD To have it finally recorded is a cool thing for me PERIOD

Whats next for The Maine

Pat Were playing a couple dates in fall and then were going to go out in the desert and figure out what happens PERIOD Were just going to go out there for like two months and get lost
