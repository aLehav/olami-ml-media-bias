9061,2023-11-04,"the nursing program at Linfield Colleges Portland campus is both historic and successful PERIOD For the past six months Rosa Gibson class of  has been working on locating and preserving artifacts from the nursing programs early days PERIOD

With the colleges support she has been able to organize and display the collection PERIOD

Most of the items were first on the Portland campus being shuffled around various closets said Rachael Woody Linfield archives director PERIOD

The first half of the collection made it to the archives  years ago before the archives program at the McMinnville campus had been established PERIOD The Portland campus continued to come upon old artifacts. the first collection opened recently and is located in Peterson Hall at the Linfield Portland campus PERIOD

In January  a second exhibit of the collection will be unveiled at the Willamette Heritage Commission in Salem Ore. and will be on display for nine months PERIOD

Only  collections are chosen annually to be on display at the Willamette Heritage Commission PERIOD

Some of the most notable objects in the collection are daily bulletins from the American Hospital Association yearbooks pamphlets about the hospital alumni materials binders letters from the governor scrapbooks and articles about the medical field PERIOD

There are two framed certificates awarded to Emily Loveridge who started the nursing program in  PERIOD One designates her as a registered nurse in the state of Oregon from  and the other establishes her as a licensed anesthetist in the state of Oregon from  PERIOD

Along with documents the collection includes photos of Loveridge family employees students physicians nurses alumni and patients PERIOD

The collection also holds nursing uniforms a silver tea set porcelain dolls and a variety of other objects PERIOD

When Gibson began the project the collection was kept in  boxes PERIOD

Its amazing that the campus held onto everything Woody said PERIOD

Perhaps more interesting than the collection itself is the information that can be gained about the nursing programs founder Loveridge PERIOD

Originally trained in nursing on the East Coast Loveridge was brokenhearted when her fianc died of tuberculosis PERIOD She never married and always wore black PERIOD After her fiancs death she decided to travel to Oregon on the Oregon Trail to help care for the sick PERIOD

When she first arrived to the hospital she was shocked by the conditions of the facility PERIOD However she was able to whip it into shape and it became one of the best teaching hospitals in the Northwest PERIOD

At the time there was no orphanage in Portland PERIOD Loveridge who never had her own children took it upon herself to adopt and care for all of the orphans PERIOD

The new Linfield nursing exhibit not only offers a glimpse into the life of Loveridge it offers a look into the founding and history of the program that has helped so many PERIOD
