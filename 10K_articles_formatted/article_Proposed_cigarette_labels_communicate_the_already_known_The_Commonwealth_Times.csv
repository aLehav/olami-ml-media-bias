The Food and Drug Administration has legally had its say in the tobacco industry since President Barack Obama signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in  PERIOD Now the FDA is proposing big changes PERIOD Through this legislation they attained the power to regulate packaging marketing place bans and to control the amount of nicotine in tobacco products available to the public PERIOD Their inability to get rid of the tobacco franchise altogether seems to be the only thing left to do PERIOD

The Department of Health and Human Services is asserting their new role after issuing the Required Warnings for Cigarette Packages and Advertisements Rule which introduced  possible new warning labels for cigarette packaging PERIOD The nine that are chosen will be enforced to circulate after Oct PERIOD   PERIOD These new labels that will be covering half of the front and rear sides of cigarette packs are meant to visually warn regular and firsttime consumers of the dangers of smoking PERIOD Pictures of a body on an autopsy table and a man with a hole in his neck next to grim phrases like smoking can kill you and cigarettes cause cancer will now grace cigarette boxes PERIOD

These new attempts at deterring smokers are cartoons compared to the gruesome images foreign countries have chosen to cover their cigarette products PERIOD It seems very unrealistic that this will truly make a difference for those who are already users PERIOD

It seems the reward that a cigarette provides has outweighed the consequences for decades and shows no signs of changing PERIOD Although this effort is commendable it will probably end up a failed one because the FDA is simply preaching to the choir PERIOD

VCU student Eric Bobber agrees PERIOD I already know the consequences he said PERIOD

This seemed to be a unanimous response among the student smokers PERIOD The cost proved to be the biggest reason people quit or chose not to smoke not the health consequences PERIOD The attempt of the labels to discourage potential smokers does not seem like it will be successful PERIOD Once an individual has their hands on a pack of cigarettes chances are the warning has come way too late PERIOD The graphic labels are not providing any new information ideas or images PERIOD These labels are facts individuals defiantly know but have chosen to ignore PERIOD

However this is still a very important measure from the government in their antitobacco policies PERIOD Tobacco accounts for  deaths per year and with over  children and teens becoming regular smokers every day a more substantive effort than a picture label is needed PERIOD Vapor cigarettes could be a better alternative for smokers health risk assessments should be encouraged since the FDA regulates that as well PERIOD Possibly even putting limits on hours where cigarettes are sold and raising prices PERIOD The FDA needs a wide range of real citizens opinions more than anything PERIOD

Still unless there is a way to get rid of cigarettes entirely it may be safe to assume that smoking cigarettes is and always will be a matter of personal choice that cannot truly be regulated PERIOD
