Every time President Barack Obama stands at the podium after a mass shooting there is a call for an end to tragic gun violence PERIOD After the shooting on Umpqua Community Colleges campus it was not so different PERIOD

The president stood before the press on Oct PERIOD  noticeably frustrated that once again a mass shooting had taken place in the United States this time resulting in the death of  people on the college campus in Roseburg Oregon PERIOD

Somehow this has become routineThe reporting is routine PERIOD My response here at this podium ends up being routine the conversation in the aftermath of it  We have become numb to this. obama urged citizens to take a stand politically when it comes to gun violence and gun control PERIOD

I would ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws and to save lives and to let young people grow upThat will require a change of politics on this issue.As a student I deserve the right to protect myself but guns arent necessary for selfdefense said Rognstad who often keeps a gun in his car PERIOD

Rognstad said mental health checks may be effective in reducing gun violence PERIOD





Despite their beliefs on how to prevent gun violence through improved regulations and processing both Vollmer and Rognstad share doubt that legislation will actually reduce gun violence PERIOD

I feel completely powerless Vollmer said PERIOD It doesnt matter what we want the representatives will do what they want PERIOD Thats why the political system is so messed up. mitchell Nemeth is a member of the National Rifle Association but he does not own a gun PERIOD Like Rognstad he feels that citizens specifically students in college should be allowed to carry guns on campus PERIOD

Anyone who is going to bring a weapon on campus to cause harm is going to do so whether or not campus carry is legal he said PERIOD What campus carry allows for is a small group of responsible individuals to possess a weapon on campus. in order to still ensure safety around campus Nemeth a junior finance and legal studies major from Sandy Springs said those who want to carry on campus should go through extra training and more education programs PERIOD

As far as nationwide gun control Nemeth said that gun control falls on a spectrum PERIOD

Gun control becomes a negative thing when certain politicians aim to ban guns from cities and ban certain types of weaponsCities that ban guns leave their citizens unarmed and as we all know criminals never follow the law so there will always be a way for the bad guys to get weapons. nemeth also shares Vollmers views when it comes to the public say in gun policies PERIOD

The issue with modern day politics is that our politicians of both parties are completely and entirely bought off by lobbyists and special interests groups he said PERIOD Nowadays every day people can play a role in legislation by having massive rallies for or against gun control. jeremy Messer who owns a gun and is against campus carry does not agree with the ideas the NRA stands for PERIOD

Messer a junior history and prelaw major from Newnan is an avid hunter and practice shooter and has a semiautomatic pistol in his truck for selfdefense PERIOD But he said he thinks allowing college students to carry weapons on campus is unwise PERIOD



When it comes to voicing opinions about gun control and promoting change Messer said he feels that young adults certainly can have a voice but often do not PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

Trey Hood a political science professor at UGA said the discussion about issues like background checks at gun shows will not reduce gun violence to any great extent PERIOD

Some ideas could impact things at the fringe but we probably have close to at least one weapon per person in the U.S he said PERIOD

Hood said theres a buyback program in Australia that ultimately ended up being involuntary confiscation but said he could not see that happening in the United States PERIOD

Its such a divisive issue politically so its hard to do anything short of extreme PERIOD I mean people still argue what exactly the wording of the Second Amendment means but its on the books either way he said PERIOD

Hood said he sees no real solution to gun violence in the United States given the circumstances PERIOD

As long as you allow weapons to be bought and purchased by lawabiding citizens it hard to predict who will abuse weapons he said PERIOD We train our police officers how to respond but as far as proactive prevention nothing short of the Australian situation will solve much especially when the majority of constituents have no issue with gun ownership. still Messer said he holds on to hope that one day the president will not have to stand in front of a podium to ask for legislation in the wake of a mass shooting PERIOD

I think  years from now people will laugh at debating gun control like how we laugh at people opposing womens suffrage in the 1920s or emancipationIts really clich but theyre truly on the wrong side of history. in advance of the Day of National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence the AthensClarke County police department along with members of the Clarke County School District U.S PERIOD Attorneys Office and the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice visited four local middle schools to speak about the threat and prevention of gun violence PERIOD
