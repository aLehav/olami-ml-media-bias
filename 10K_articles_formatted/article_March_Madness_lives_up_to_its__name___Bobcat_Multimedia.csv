March Madness is in full swing and college basketball fans are now looking back at what the  tournament has looked like PERIOD

Arizona States Desmond Cambridge Jr PERIOD and Michigans Hunter Dickinson kept their teams on the NCAA tournament bubble with miracle shots two weeks ahead of Selection Sunday PERIOD

The Sun Devils and Wolverines were among a handful of teams trying to squeeze into the Field of  for the  mens basketball tournament and those shots kept them in the mix PERIOD

This years Final Four is April  at NRG Stadium in Houston and fans now have a chance to see which four teams will get to compete in the national championship PERIOD

The last four teams were Mississippi State North Carolina West Virginia and Oklahoma State PERIOD The first four out were Clemson Utah State Arizona State and Michigan PERIOD

Entering the tournament Alabama secured their top spot for the South region while Purdue took the East region PERIOD Houston got the number one seed for the Midwest and Kansas took it for the West region PERIOD

Houston opened with the best odds to win this years March Madness at  according to the BetMGM sportsbook PERIOD However an injury to star Marcus Sasser cast some doubt on the Cougars leaving it to be anybodys tournament to win PERIOD

Alabama  and defending champion Kansas  were next in line followed by Purdue  PERIOD The second tier of UCLA Arizona Texas and UConn were slightly sneakier bets to win it all but still had the highend talent to erase the chalk PERIOD

As always everyone tried to predict which upsets would take place in the first round of the tournament the two frontrunners being Oral Roberts and Charleston PERIOD

Oral Roberts took on the mighty Duke Blue Devils in the first round with the line opening at Duke . but ultimately fell PERIOD Oral Roberts ranked third in the nation in points per game . and they committed just . turnovers per game at that pace not to mention they had a 7foot5 center Connor Vanover who was a big matchup problem for anyone PERIOD

Charleston had San Diego State in the first round and the opening line was San Diego State . pERIOD Coach Pat Kelsey led No PERIOD  Charleston to the NCAA tournament in his second season and senior guard Dalton Bolton alongside 6foot10 Ante Brzovic were a tough insideoutside combination PERIOD San Diego State defeated Charleston and advanced PERIOD

Both Oral Roberts and Charleston were  seeds in this tournament PERIOD In the past  years there have been  12over5 upsets and at the same time there have only been  11over6 wins and  10over7 results PERIOD

I have Alabama winning it all said sophomore business major Michael Larruso PERIOD As long as Brandon Miller plays I do not see anyone taking down the Crimson Tide. i have a couple of big upsets this year PERIOD I picked  seed Furman to beat  seed Virginia and I also have  seed Montana State taking down  seed Kansas State said junior accounting major Tucker Sutton PERIOD

Many people have traditions for watching the March Madness tournament whether it be watching it with friends or eating certain foods while watching PERIOD

I always watch the first day with a bunch of my friends said junior mass communication major Christian Castillo PERIOD It is always so fun to see whose bracket gets busted right away and it makes for a very entertaining day. the  mens NCAA tournament will continue Saturday April  with the first game between Florida Atlantic University and San Diego State University PERIOD The second will be between the University of Miami and the University of Connecticut PERIOD Fans can now only speculate as to who will be the final team standing on April  at NRG Stadium in Houston Texas PERIOD
