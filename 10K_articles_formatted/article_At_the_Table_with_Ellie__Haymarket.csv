8145,2013-02-25,"my parents college reunions fall on the same weekend every year PERIOD One parent can never visit the others and generally my dad takes the kids to his because we live only an hour from his alma mater PERIOD When I was six my mom decided to take me along on the five hour drive from Philadelphia to Amherst PERIOD I cant say that I remember the reunion itself but what I do remember is Northampton PERIOD More importantly I remember a specific part of Northampton PERIOD

The reunion had finished and were on our way home PERIOD I was exhausted and immediately dozed off lulled to sleep by the moving car PERIOD After what felt like hours but must really have been only  minutes my mom was nudging me awake prodding me to leave the comfort of my warm seat PERIOD Slowly I got out rubbing my eyes yawning and probably about to whine crankily about having to wake up PERIOD However my mom quickly ushered me into a small caf on Main Street distracting me from all possible griping PERIOD

This past weekend I gasped in surprise as I walked into that same caf smack in the middle of Northampton and tucked away on Main Street PERIOD I exclaimed excitedly to my friend that I had been here before I knew this caf from so many years ago I remembered the worn wooden floors and the cramped entry hall lined with old paintings and photographs in ornate and antique frames that somehow reminded me of Harry Potter PERIOD

My mom had recommended that I visit the place and mentioned that I had gone once but I didnt quite believe her PERIOD Suddenly walking through the compact entryway and into the airy bright main room with the high ceilings and oldfashioned fans as well as the rustic bar and juice maker I remembered the Haymarket Caf and Juice Joint PERIOD

My roommate who had visited Haymarket more recently and knew the lay of the land led me downstairs to a dim room with low ceilings comfortable and intimate seating and candlelit tables PERIOD We quickly dropped our backpacks slid into two seats abandoned all hope of doing any schoolwork and scanned the menu PERIOD She and I scoured the list noting the various smoothies omelets breakfast sandwiches pancakes tofuvegan scramble and the oatmeal PERIOD Soon the waitress took our orders and we sat back awaiting a filling and relaxing brunch PERIOD

My friends plate arrived first and my stomach began rumbling PERIOD Clearly the Haymarket Caf knows how to prepare oatmeal PERIOD Topping her bowl of creamy grains was a good portion of homemade granola and fruit compote PERIOD She dug in gleefully as I watched enviously PERIOD

When my Bourbon French toast arrived I stared at the beautiful presentation PERIOD Alongside four sections of French toast sat an artful arrangement of bananas strawberries grapefruit grapes and apples PERIOD

Then my hunger took over PERIOD I quickly slathered a bit of the crme frache onto a piece of toast following that with a sizeable drizzle of REAL maple syrup PERIOD With the first bite I knew that I would enjoy my meal and return for others PERIOD Although there was not so much of the cinnamon that I love which I probably love too much the crme frache provided a slight tang that perfectly balanced the saccharine syrup and gave the toast a sense of freshness PERIOD I chewed quickly working to make it through my first bite and have another as soon as possible PERIOD However I appreciated the texture noticing that the slight crunch and toughness of the toast provided a satisfying sensation PERIOD

In between bites of toast topped with crme frache and drips of maple syrup I contentedly snacked on the fruit savoring the freshness and lightness of the entire meal PERIOD Rather than feeling like I was eating a rich dish laden with extra butter I sensed that I was savoring a satisfying filling and yet delicate meal PERIOD Finally I sat back nursing my bottomless cup of coffee as I surveyed the empty plate PERIOD My roommate and I shared an agreeable glance noting that neither of us could be any happier PERIOD

Shortly our waitress arrived with our check and my friend and I exclaimed in surprise PERIOD Our simple but extremely satisfying meal of oatmeal French toast coffee and iced peppermint tea had only cost us   with the tip included PERIOD Quickly I grabbed a menu and scanned the items noting that no breakfast dish reached  and no lunch or dinner plate reached  PERIOD Needless to say my roommate and I agreed that we would be returning PERIOD

We eventually pulled out our homework intending to begin studying and soon decided to relocate to the upper half of the caf PERIOD We made our way upstairs noticing the squeal of the milk frother and catching a few notes of the barely audible music playing in the background PERIOD Soon my roommate and I had pulled together two tables along the row of seats bordering the room and were sitting on the worn but comfortable cushions PERIOD

After a few moments I walked to the counter ogling the pastries as I did and found myself craving some carrot cake or red velvet cupcakes PERIOD However I couldnt eat another thing after gorging myself on French toast so I ordered one of their fresh inhouse roasted and brewed Fair Trade coffees PERIOD Soon I was working contentedly sipping my coffee and enjoying the comfortable and sunny atmosphere of the caf PERIOD

As we left my roommate ordered juice and we watched as the woman put multiple fruits and vegetables through a large juicer PERIOD I anticipate my own order of juice when I return to the Haymarket Caf and Juice Joint PERIOD This small caf and restaurant creates the perfect atmosphere and venue in which to study or enjoy a relaxing meal PERIOD I cannot thank my mother enough for recommending it PERIOD I am also not surprised that this is what I remember from visiting Northampton and Amherst when I was young PERIOD",At the Table with Ellie: Haymarket,Amherst College
