In  Edith Eger and her family were taken from their home in Kassa Hungary and turned prisoners of Auschwitz one of the largest most notorious concentration camps of the Holocaust PERIOD



Eger only  years old at the time spent a gruesome year in Auschwitz PERIOD

My parents were executed in the gas chambers shortly after we arrived at Auschwitz Eger said PERIOD My sister Magda and I were the only survivors of my family. eger now a clinical Pyshcologist will share her experiences with Central students on May  at  p.m PERIOD in the Jerilyn S PERIOD McIntyre Music Building Concert Hall PERIOD

This is Egers first visit to Central and she hopes that students will see her as a role model PERIOD

I would like to show students how resilience and perseverance was with me throughout my time at Auschwitz Eger said PERIOD A place where I discovered traumatizing things I never thought possible. eger was an experienced ballerina and aspiring gymnast prior to her imprisonment PERIOD

I was preparing to compete in the upcoming Olympics when my family was taken to Auschwitz Eger said PERIOD My dream was doing that. according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Dr PERIOD Josef Mengele was an infamous SS camp physician at Auschwitz and notorious for his inhumane experiments PERIOD Mengele soon found out about Egers dance history PERIOD

Upon her arrival to the camp Mengele requested she entertain him with her dancing PERIOD

I had to close my eyes and pretend I was dancing in an opera house in Hungary Eger said PERIOD I could not bring myself to accept that I was dancing for the man that executed my family. according to Eger it isnt her experiences at Auschwitz that are important but instead what they taught her PERIOD

When you are in a situation like that you have to try to survive Eger said find the power within you as I did PERIOD You have to be a survivor and never a victim. eger uses her history of survival to give hope to others suffering through traumatic circumstances PERIOD

Its not whats happening its what you do with it Eger said PERIOD

After a horrifying year Eger was liberated in May  PERIOD She was found in a pit surrounded by corpses weighing only  pounds PERIOD

I was left for dead and I was rescued by an American soldier Eger said PERIOD

Auschwitz was one of the last concentration camps to be liberated before the war ended PERIOD Eger still holds onto the Red Cross documentation of when she was found PERIOD

After her liberation Eger came across an ad for a concert featuring a violinist PERIOD The violinist was her older sister Klara who Eger didnt know was still alive PERIOD

It was a very emotional experience Eger said PERIOD She became my mother after that PERIOD She felt guilty that she wasnt with me and my family in Auschwitz. klara Eger had a long career as a violinist for the Sydney symphony in Australia and died in  of Alzheimers disease PERIOD

Eger would like to dedicate some time for questions and encourages students to watch the DVD Seeds of Resiliency which features Egers inspiring story and journey to survival PERIOD

Today among other things Eger is a renowned clinical psychologist and author PERIOD She works with victims of sexual assault depression and posttraumatic stress disorder PERIOD

When I am working with sexual abuse victims or even when I am speaking to students I tell them dont check out I never did Eger said PERIOD

The only thing Eger held on to while at Auschwitz was her spirit PERIOD It was the one thing she felt they couldnt take away PERIOD

I never allowed the Nazis to murder my spirit Eger said PERIOD They could beat and torture me but never ever take away my spirit. heidi Szpek philosophy and religious studies department chair and professor believes Eger will bring a new perspective in the way she shares her story PERIOD

I think no matter who you are people go through a variety of horrific experiences be it our veterans be it survivors of genocide be it individuals who have been abused Szpeck said PERIOD They all need to find a way to move forward and I think that is the uniqueness PERIOD She wants to share her story and experiences but it doesnt end there  she wants to help others. szpeck teaches Holocaust studies as part of the philosophy and religious studies department PERIOD

According to Szpeck in her studies of the Holocaust she has read memoirs historical documentations and books that describe the horrors and adverse conditions the prisoners of concentration camps faced PERIOD

You learn aboutthe whole process of those who come to the camps Szpeck said PERIOD The routine of those who were sent to Auschwitz if not immediately sent to the gas chambers who were allowed to live PERIOD You learn about the lack of food the horrific conditions the suffering endured the forced labor under adverse conditions. what occurred in Auschwitz also occurred in other concentration camps PERIOD

According to Szpeck recent research indicates that there were a total of approximately  camps established by the Nazis PERIOD Auschwitz however has become symbolic of the Holocaust PERIOD

In a way when we hear Auschwitz it evokes understanding or memory of all these camps and it should also evoke memories of individuals who suffered in different camps and different situations Szpeck said PERIOD

Szpeck values the opportunity to listen to the story of a survivor PERIOD

You can take a class on the Holocaust you can read a book and you can read memoirs  historical ones personal ones Szpeck said PERIOD You can listen to music composed in the camps PERIOD You can read poetry composed in the camps but that is not the same as listening to the story of someone who was there. as a professor Szpeck encourages her students to attend Egers visit and as chair she also encourages her faculty and staff to attend PERIOD

Its been  years  we start marking those specific dates connected with WWII and the Holocaust and soon there will be no survivors to tell their stories Szpeck said PERIOD As years pass by and we become further removed from events we rely on historical written works but there are those who wont believe those who need to hear it from someone whos had these experiences. the Center for Diversity and Social Justice is sponsoring Egers visit in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month which is celebrated in the month of May PERIOD

Michelle Cyrus is a diversity officer for CDSJ PERIOD She hopes students will take advantage of this onceinalifetime opportunity PERIOD

How many times do you actually have the opportunity to talk to someone that has experienced something of that magnitude Its history Cyrus said PERIOD You have living breathing history at the moment. by the students for the students of Central Washington University",Auschwitz survivor to share her story â€“ The Observer,Central Washington University
