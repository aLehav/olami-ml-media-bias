Stepping out as a solo artist can be daunting for a musician especially for one who has spent over a decade being associated with a particular band PERIOD Luckily Ryan Key is up to the task PERIOD

Key first gained a footing in the musical scene in the late 90s as a member of rock and pop punk band Yellowcard PERIOD He spent  years as the bands principal songwriter lead singer and rhythm guitarist penning such hits as Ocean Avenue and Lights and Sounds. the band released its final album Yellowcard in  and now Key is branching out on his own as a solo artist PERIOD

After Yellowcard I was going to get into some songwriting and producing of my own Key said in an interview with The Daily PERIOD But then I had this opportunity arise to play guitar with New Found GloryWhen they asked me if Id play guitar they also asked if Id open the tours just as myself. the need for songs to play on tour was part of what led to Keys debut solo EP released under his full name William Ryan Key PERIOD Thirteen out May  from The Lone Tree Recordings is a surprising departure from the rock Yellowcard fans may be familiar with PERIOD Each of the five tracks is acoustic gentle and beautifully introspective from the clipped and poetic Vultures  which may be the most familiar bridge from Yellowcard material into this new folksy territory  to the existential Great Unknown. over the last year or so Ive been doing a lot of smaller acoustic shows  I wasnt sure if that was what I wanted my own songs to sound like Key said PERIOD It took a long time to get started but once I started writing the songs it really started coming more naturally. the new EP is full of folk influences both in the melodic compositions and lyrics of the songs PERIOD Key cited a wide variety of artists as instrumental in helping to build his attraction to singersongwriter music including Ben Folds Five Explosions in the Sky Ryan Adams Jason Isbell Death Cab for Cutie and Bon Iver PERIOD

Im always looking to a lot of singersongwriters Key said PERIOD When I picked up my guitar and started writing thats where that influence inspired me. while a diverse array of influences factored into Thirteen it is still by all means its own project PERIOD The new EP is a unique and individual effort thanks also to the fact that it was produced by The Lone Tree Recordings Keys own recording studio based in Tennessee PERIOD

I produced the EP myself with my friend Arun Bali PERIOD He plays guitar in the band Saves the Day PERIOD We coproduced it together PERIOD He just has this really cool analog indie rock vibe Key said PERIOD Hes an amazing guitarist and really had a lot of influence on the atmospheric songs you hear on the record. the fact that the entire EP is selfproduced through The Lone Tree gave Key a lot of freedom to work with in developing his new sound PERIOD

The nice thing about having your own record studio is that you can press record whenever you want said Key adding that he knew from the beginning that he would aim to have about five songs on the EP PERIOD So once I had five ideas I was like well Im not even going to write any more. this allowed more freedom for making these songs sound polished and complete PERIOD Working on his own without Yellowcard to bounce ideas off of Key would often let the music direct him melodically and lyrically. so the process is different from with Yellowcard but there are a lot of similarities as well he said PERIOD

Yellowcard often released acoustic versions of their own music including the albums When Youre Through Thinking Say Yes and Ocean Avenue PERIOD Nevertheless the tender feel of Thirteen is new territory and Key admits to being apprehensive about the adventurous delve into his own direction PERIOD

I was nervous because its so mellow PERIOD I mean I dont even use a guitar pick on any of the songs he said PERIOD

Reception to the music so far has been positive the single Vultures was released recently to widespread popular approval PERIOD Key called the public reaction to the new music amazing adding his appreciation that no ones standing out in the crowd yelling at me to play Yellowcard songs. debuting as a solo artist after such a lengthy tenure with a band let alone a well known one like Yellowcard is bound to prompt some selfexamination for any artist PERIOD Luckily being honest with himself has always been a big part of Keys songwriting and he is no stranger to asking  and answering  these sorts of questions PERIOD

A big part of what I write about is selfrealization and looking at myself my faults my mistakes PERIOD This record being as stripped down as it is Im letting myself and the lyrics be as stripped down and as naked as possible Key said PERIOD It encompasses a lot of what myself and my family have been feeling lately PERIOD Weve struggled with losing people we love and people we love being hurt  Even when things are going well you can still be struggling with what people you love are struggling with. naturally the album takes on a lot of themes involving looking back on the past from being haunted by it in Form and Figure to the experience of thoughtful nostalgia in Old Friends. key noted that he had expected to end up exploring these sorts of themes but that the record brought with it some surprising new ideas well PERIOD

One theme that isnt super direct but I think its on there is the theme of stepping out on my own Key said PERIOD

It seems fitting that Thirteen should find a balance between looking back on a storied past and forward to an equally rich future PERIOD If these five tracks are any indication there is plenty of exciting musical territory left for Key to explore and this is only the beginning PERIOD

I dont think I thought Id feel bad but I feel better than I thought I would feel Key said of the EPs release and the public reaction to the new music PERIOD He likened the feeling to the early days of Yellowcard when there would be people from the record companies coming to see us and wed think Oh maybe this is the start of something. the stage is set for a hopeful future with Key and his team already talking about making new music and looking to put out a second EP as soon as this upcoming fall PERIOD In the meantime the New Found Glory tour is underway with a stop in Pontiac MI coming up on June  PERIOD

I feel like theres a lot of opportunity ahead I didnt even realize was there Key said PERIOD It seems like its going somewhere and thats all I can ask for. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
