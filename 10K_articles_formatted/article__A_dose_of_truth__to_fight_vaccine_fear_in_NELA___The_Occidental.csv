Ceci Dominguez had been on the Los Angeles County website for most of the morning trying to sign up for a COVID19 vaccination appointment PERIOD She called the offices of two local council members Mitch OFarrell and Gil Cedillo as well as a friend and together they were piecing together how to navigate the portal PERIOD All of the appointments however were booked PERIOD

Then at  p.m PERIOD Jan PERIOD  Dominguez found an open slot PERIOD It was at  p.m PERIOD that same day PERIOD

I left my back door open I left my dogs in the house Dominguez said and proceeded to drive to Dodger Stadium. arriving at one of the countrys largest vaccination sites just three minutes away from her home in Elysian Valley Dominguez became one of more than  Angelenos as of Feb PERIOD  to receive their first vaccine dose against COVID19  around 16percent of the countys population. emerging as the new epicenter of the national COVID19 pandemic in late December LA has just begun observing decreasing case rates after hitting its case peak on Jan PERIOD   but not before one in every three county residents contracted the virus according to the county health departments own estimates PERIOD

The pandemic has gone especially unchecked in underserved predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods PERIOD Data from The New York Times suggests that one in nine residents of Mt PERIOD Washington and Highland Park which are  percent and  percent nonwhite respectively have had COVID19 PERIOD The case rate in Santa Monica which is twothirds white is just one in  PERIOD

Yet early data suggests that nationally and in Los Angeles  a city where transportation and healthcare infrastructure remain disproportionately inaccessible to minority communities  Black and Latinx residents are being vaccinated at disproportionately lower rates than white residents PERIOD Legacies of medical abuse such as forced sterilization campaigns against Latina mothers in 1970s Los Angeles are also likely to make nonwhite residents more hesitant to get vaccinated PERIOD

According to Ilan Shapiro a bilingual physician and Medical Director for Health Education and Wellness at AltaMed the key to building back this trust lies in evidencebased messaging using media and trusted community members to spread news of the vaccines benefits in laymans terms PERIOD

One of the things we need to be doing is making sure we are vaccinating our communities against fear with a dose of truth Shapiro said PERIOD

Shapiro has spoken with anchors on Univisin and Noticias62 and uses his social media to share information about the latest COVID19 developments PERIOD He has also teamed up with the Mexican Consulate of Los Angeles to do outreach  all residents regardless of citizenship status are eligible to be vaccinated but many undocumented residents fear deportation if they make themselves too visible PERIOD

Shapiro said the COVID19 vaccines quick development resulted from technology and research first discovered when combatting SARS and MERS in the early 2000s and added that the mild side effect profile should not cause concern PERIOD

He emphasized the importance of networks of bilingual messengers known as promotoras  community members who receive basic health education training  and the use of preexisting voting and census outreach infrastructure to speed up vaccine registration PERIOD

We need to be present throughout the entire process Shapiro said PERIOD

Dominguez who is a secondgeneration Mexican American said she has spoken with friends and family members who are hesitant about getting the vaccine PERIOD After dropping from a preferred provider insurance plan to a health maintenance insurance plan in  Dominguez said she has often been unimpressed with the quality of facilities she has visited and does not blame community members for wanting to limit their interactions with healthcare providers PERIOD

It runs through our minds because history has told us that these things malpractice have happened Dominguez said PERIOD

Technological challenges and the enormous demand have also left many seniors with stories like Dominguezs struggling for hours to navigate complex registration websites PERIOD Margaret Irwin elder director for Eagle Rock Neighborhood Council ERNC said she has begun working with the developers of the community service app Mon Ami to match NELA seniors with volunteers who can help them register for a vaccination appointment or drive them to vaccination sites PERIOD

Im hoping if nothing else this will make a senior feel better that were on their side and we want to get them vaccinated Irwin said PERIOD I really treasure every single senior PERIOD And if theyre having trouble getting a vaccination we have many abled compassionate people in Eagle Rock who are right now willing to help. seniors who call a hotline number    will be able to leave a voicemail with their name number and the nature of their request according to Irwin who said she knows of at least five to  volunteers who have committed PERIOD Based on that information Irwin said she will then connect each senior with a volunteer through the Mon Ami app PERIOD

Irwin also said that the ERNC has been discussing other ideas to facilitate vaccine distribution in NELA including popup tents or delivery to senior homes should the supply become available PERIOD LA County has administered nearly all of its vaccine supply forcing some distribution sites including Dodger Stadium to administer only second doses. we have to be patient Irwin said PERIOD

Social media has also served as a powerful tool during the vaccine rollout PERIOD Vaccinerelated posts in forums like the Eagle Rock Neighborhood Group have garnered more than  likes with commenters describing wait times between  minutes and two hours PERIOD Upon receiving her vaccination and knowing the hesitancy of many community members Dominguez decided she would speak about her experience by posting a video to Facebook PERIOD

I sent it to all my seniors I sent it to almost everyone in my phone Dominguez said PERIOD

Dominguezs video was amplified by the East Area Progressive Democrats EAPD club for which Dominguez serves as membership chair PERIOD President of the EAPD Hans Johnson said the group has been involved in combating misinformation and promoting community involvement since the beginning of the pandemic PERIOD Evidencebased information spreads most effectively when carried by a trusted community member like Dominguez he said PERIOD

The clubs information is tailored to that mode of delivery Johnson added PERIOD Some people are comfortable doing it in neighborhoods that they know and in their own buildings or multifamily dwellings next to them or near them. the centering of vaccine distribution at large centers like Dodger Stadium accessible only by private vehicle also presents complications PERIOD Johnson said the EAPD has been pushing local government to diversify distribution methods recognizing that many over the age of   the only age group currently eligible for vaccination  may struggle to drive or wait in lines for extended periods PERIOD Programs like Irwins elder hotline may help address some of these problems PERIOD

The chief concern were facing is not necessarily about accessing this vaccine Johnson said PERIOD Its about the mode of delivery of this vaccine and the scarcity of vaccines at this point which is curbing the countys ability or the citys ability to supplement the driveup delivery with mobile inhome vaccinations. jessica Dirkes professor and public health program coordinator at Occidental College also said she found the current method of distribution counterintuitive PERIOD

I think that these big huge centers are a very odd approach Dirkes said PERIOD There should be more of a focus on finding community clinics that are more accessible to people. dirkes added that she thinks the vaccine rollout will gain steam as more people get vaccinated and learn of others who have been vaccinated PERIOD Most people know someone who has had COVID19 a fact which might persuade those who have resisted vaccinations in the past PERIOD

I do believe the system will catch up with itself Dirkes said PERIOD

For the time being seniors in NELA like Dominguez are looking forward to their next shot and telling all who will listen about their experience PERIOD

I showed a picture of myself on Facebook with my bandaid Dominguez said PERIOD And I said Im fine. i cant wait for my second dose I said PERIOD I just cannot wait. nELA seniors who need help registering for a vaccination appointment can leave a voicemail at  or email Margaret Irwin at margaret.irwineaglerockcouncil.org PERIOD
