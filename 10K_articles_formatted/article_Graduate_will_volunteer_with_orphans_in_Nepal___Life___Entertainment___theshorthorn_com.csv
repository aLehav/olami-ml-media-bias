Linguistics senior Jessica Nordon will be volunteering at an orphanage in Nepal for six months PERIOD Nordan chose to volunteer in Nepal over Japan and China PERIOD

Graduation is around the corner which has seniors anticipating their next move PERIOD Some will go off and enter the job market while others will take the opportunity to travel overseas and volunteer like linguistics senior Jessica Nordon PERIOD

Nordons plans to volunteer in an orphanage in Nepal for six months after graduation havent changed even after the earthquake that hit Kathmandu on Saturday PERIOD She said this has actually made her want to go even more to offer her help PERIOD She originally planned to leave to Nepal in the summer but because traveling overseas is expensive she will leave in September to allow time to save up money for her trip PERIOD

Nordon decided to volunteer at an orphanage because she enjoys working with children and believes it is unfortunate that the orphans especially in a poor country feel like they dont have anyone PERIOD

I just want to help them in a way for them to feel like they have someone Nordon said PERIOD

In  Nordon studied abroad in South Korea and through the exchange program she made a friend from Nepal PERIOD Her friend described how beautiful Nepal is and said she should visit it one day PERIOD Nordon said she didnt really think much of it until now because she is getting ready to graduate and leave school PERIOD

It becomes so daunting when you graduate because you have to make this huge decision about what am I going to do Nordon said PERIOD

Nordon decided volunteering overseas would be a great opportunity because she really enjoys helping other people PERIOD

I may not be good at a lot of things but I am good at helping other people so I feel like this opportunity would be good for me Nordon said PERIOD

Nordon came across the program Nepal Orphan Homes in Katmandu one night while searching for different volunteer programs PERIOD She asked her friend from Nepal for information to help her to pick a wellrecommended program PERIOD Nordon said the program has bases in other cities in Nepal but she would be more comfortable staying in a larger city because Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world PERIOD

In Nepal there is hardly any Internet blackouts can occur for more than  hours and in some places and people have to boil their own water for a shower she said PERIOD Nordon said larger cities have slightly better circumstances PERIOD

Nordon will be living at the orphanage helping with the daytoday life of the children there PERIOD

Nordons parents and friends were hesitant about her wanting to volunteer abroad but theyre happy she is doing something she is passionate about PERIOD

Jayr Logan linguistics senior and friend of Nordon said Nepal can be a dangerous country for a young girl PERIOD

Thuy Nguyen linguistics senior and friend of Nordon agreed that volunteering in a poor country can be more dangerous PERIOD

I asked her why she didnt pick another country Nguyen said PERIOD She wanted to help children in a poor country and experience a different culture. even though she was against the idea at first Nguyen said she understands the pressure that comes with graduation and feels that as long as Nordon is careful it will be a good experience for her PERIOD

Nordon has set up a GoFundMe page in hopes of raising  for her trip PERIOD

While I think it is important that people do the things they feel passionate about I also think there are serious ethical concerns to consider PERIOD For example  Are you doing work that a local person could do  What happens when you leave   months will build a bond with the children PERIOD

We believe that sharing English skills is a better way to volunteer PERIOD There are numerous articles written about sham orphanages so if you are going to volunteer make sure you research it really well PERIOD

Be realistic about what you can achieve PERIOD Maintain contact after you come home and carry on fundraising so that the orphanage can employ local people PERIOD In the link below under the section ethical volunteering we have a number of important articles on volunteering in orphanages PERIOD
