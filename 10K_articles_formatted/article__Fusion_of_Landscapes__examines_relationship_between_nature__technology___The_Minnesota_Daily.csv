Fusion of Landscapes a new art exhibition at the Larson Gallery in the University of Minnesotas St PERIOD Paul Student Center explores the intersection of natural and technological environments PERIOD

The exhibit which opened on March  features artwork by Meagan Marsh Pine and Nick ChatfieldTaylor PERIOD The media range from pixelated paintings to tinsel being blown by an electric fan to a video sourcing footage from the National Park Service and Google Earth PERIOD

Fusion of Landscapes is open until May  PERIOD

Joy Quach an arts and culture event planner at the gallery said Pine and ChatfieldTaylors installations were chosen out of about  submissions by a selection committee PERIOD The committee paired their artwork together for the exhibit despite the artists not knowing each other prior PERIOD

Lindsey Butler a gallery attendant said the committee chose Larson for the exhibit because it is more spacious than other art galleries on campus and could best accommodate the installations PERIOD Larson also tends to feature more 3D exhibits to make the most out of the space and Fusion of Landscapes interacts with all of the space offered in the gallery PERIOD

On top of the brick towers and wall photography showcased Teagan Londo another gallery attendant said the exhibit is distinct because it combines elements of audio and video which we have not had very often. meagan Marsh Pine

Pine a lecturer of photography at the University of WisconsinEau Claire said some of their installations were inspired by aerial photography and digital camouflage PERIOD Pine wanted to examine the relationship between the two and combine them when making their pixelated paintings featured throughout the gallery PERIOD

When creating this exhibit Pine aimed to reference how landscapes have been built and constructed in society PERIOD They said they drew inspiration from visual histories and patterns in landscapes and twisted them to make people question the things they see and how that positions them as viewers. i was kind of building it off of this visual language that I have been creating Pine said PERIOD Im interested in this duality of real and unreal. pine graduated from the University in  with a Bachelors degree in journalism art and interdisciplinary design but said they didnt develop their current style until graduate school PERIOD Pines work was more photocentric in their undergraduate years but they still consider photography to be the backbone of their work PERIOD

Nick ChatfieldTaylor

ChatfieldTaylors tinsel installations which consist of three pieces of tinsel positioned throughout the gallery with varying amounts of air exposure originally began as a happy accident while he was working on another project in his studio PERIOD Since he left the window open the project began fluttering in the wind and after he started to experiment with air as a medium in his artwork PERIOD

By contrast another piece by ChatfieldTaylor called The Walked Triangle features photos of a distant hill with a triangle path connecting three bushes PERIOD He walked this path daily for at least a month so he could see the path from far away PERIOD

Grass is a worthy adversary he joked PERIOD

ChatfieldTaylor said Pines artwork is very labor intensive while his is more abstract but they both investigate similar concepts and ideas PERIOD

I think Meagan and I are both exploring themes of repetition and the variety of monotony ChatfieldTaylor said PERIOD
