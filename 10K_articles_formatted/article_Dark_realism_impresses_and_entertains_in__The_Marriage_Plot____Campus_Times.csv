In the wake of a lifechanging emotionallyintense experience people often struggle to understand how their lives have changed PERIOD

College is one such powerful experience and Pulitzer Prizewinner Jeffrey Eugenides uses the postgraduate state of mind as the jumpingoff point for his latest novel The Marriage Plot. this book is without question the best fictional treatment of college life to come along in years PERIOD

The Marriage Plot opens on the day that Madeleine Hanna Leonard Bankhead and Mitchell Grammaticus are scheduled to graduate from Brown University PERIOD Madeleines plans for graduate school are crumbling her onagain offagain friendship with religious scholar Mitchell is hanging by a thread and brilliant Leonard her exboyfriend is showing signs of manic depression PERIOD Flashbacks fill in the complex love triangle between these three characters as well as their diverse academic interests PERIOD

Then the narrative jumps forward into postgraduate life following Leonards struggle with his mental illness Madeleines attempt to look after Leonard and simultaneously plan her own career and Mitchells wild quest around the world in search of religious truth PERIOD As these three people travel and examine the state of their lives the novel gradually takes on an epic scope and becomes an absolutely engrossing read PERIOD

Like any standard work of college fiction The Marriage Plot features a fair share of partying and sexual exploration PERIOD The first  pages memorably feature a hilarious and absolutely spoton account of an awful hangover PERIOD

However The Marriage Plot quickly abandons the clichs of college fiction for darker and more cerebral subject matter PERIOD The progression of Leonards manic depression is related in harrowing heartbreaking detail PERIOD

Extended meditations on theology deconstructionist literary theory and molecular biology punctuate the narrative PERIOD Cringeinducing descriptions of illness appear in the chapters where Mitchell works in Mother Teresas Indian hospice PERIOD In short the book is not for everyone PERIOD Still The Marriage Plot takes the hopes dreams and intellects of young people seriously resulting in a much more authentic portrayal of college life than is generally seen in pop culture such as in Animal House and Legally Blonde. besides believably conveying college and the difficulties of postgraduation life the novels purpose appears to be twofold PERIOD On one level Eugenides emulates the tropes of Victorian romantic fiction  The Marriage Plot features a headstrong female protagonist brooding and mysterious love interestsoverbearing parents and a convoluted narrative centered on the female leads search for a suitable marriage partner PERIOD Eugenides simultaneously critiques the nineteenth century romance novel showing the limits of this oldfashioned conception of courtship in reality and in a postfeminist era PERIOD

This complex structure enables The Marriage Plot to function as a selfaware postmodern text and as a riproaring yarn full of twists and turns like any good Austen or Dickens text PERIOD

In addition to the brainy foundations of the plot Eugenides provides not one but three compelling protagonists all of whom struggle to understand their paradoxical personalities PERIOD Madeleine wants to be a serious scholar of Austen and the 19thcentury marriage novel but her stereotypical college female obsession with having a boyfriend constantly leads her to put off her academic dreams and truly become her own person PERIOD

Leonard fancies himself a scientific genius and sets about studying advanced biology but constantly ignores expert advice about his own mental condition which in turn causes him some dismay PERIOD
Mitchell longs to be a man of God yet finds himself repulsed by the physically and emotionally taxing work of religious volunteer service PERIOD Mitchell Madeleine and Leonards attempts to resolve the contradictions within themselves fuel the second half of the novel PERIOD

It is also worth mentioning that Eugenides does not always give equal time to the development of his characters personalities PERIOD The Marriage Plot starts off as Madeleines story then becomes the story of all three protagonists equally and ends by focusing mainly on the final epiphanies of Mitchell PERIOD Still Eugenides respects his characters and resolves all of their plot lines to some degree PERIOD
The deep psychological realism of the novel helps convey all the pain that can accompany first love the transition from the insular world of college to real life and letting go of some fantasies PERIOD But sometimes we have to abandon old dreams if we are to truly mature  or so Eugenides argues in the haunting final chapters PERIOD

Simply put The Marriage Plot is a masterpiece  a work of remarkable wit and grace  and deserves to be shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize PERIOD
