For millions of its members Facebook is a tool for selfexpression selfpromotion and communication with peers all of which are thought to be important for boosting selfesteem PERIOD However new research shows that the website can actually lower the confidence levels of insecure users PERIOD

The study found that Facebook users with poor selfimage tend to bombard the website with negative status updates making them less likeable and in turn more insecure PERIOD

Research was conducted at the University of Waterloo in Canada and published in the journal Psychological Sciencelast month PERIOD

Compared to people with high selfesteem people with low selfesteem posted updates that were relatively negative and they were less liked by strangers said coauthor and Waterloo graduate Amanda Forest PERIOD

Study authors distributed an online selfdirected survey that asked  undergraduate Facebook users to rate on a scale from one to seven their comfort with posting personal status updates PERIOD

Assistants then analyzed the participants last  status updates and recorded the level of positive and negative feedback they received from their Facebook friends PERIOD

Forest said participants with low selfesteem viewed Facebook as a great way to connect with others because it satisfied their longing for acceptance without the awkwardness of facetoface interactions PERIOD She found their openness to sharing negative emotions promising PERIOD

People with low selfesteem crave approval and acceptance and are very fearful of rejection Forest said PERIOD So one would think that they would want to post upbeat updates in order to present a pleasant and likable image of themselves. in addition participants who displayed high selfesteem received more encouraging feedback from online friends when they posted a negative status PERIOD Researchers believe this is because it was more rare and therefore more concerning to peers PERIOD

So far the studys findings have received mixed reviews from the mental health community with some experts considering their implications too broad PERIOD

The results made sense to social media researcher Amy Gonzales of the University of Pennsylvania PERIOD However she was concerned that the study was too quick to make assumptions and highlight negative consequences of the website PERIOD

In her research of Facebook she found the website actually improved selfesteem because it allows users to filter themselves to display only the most flattering photographs and wittiest comments PERIOD

When studying a new technology like Facebook I think we should reserve judgment before assuming the worst Gonzales said PERIOD Its very easy to assume that they have radical changes on people and blow those expectations out of proportion. brandon Van Der Heide an assistant professor in Communications at Ohio State University who also studies Facebook behavior believes the research was interesting but farfetched PERIOD

Facebook use has remained off the charts and people use it all the time Van Der Heide said PERIOD So if it really contributes to lower selfesteem that means people are openly choosing to engage in something that makes them feel worse about themselves and I dont think thats the case. despite the criticism and seemingly negative results Forest said the study shows promise for people with low selfesteem PERIOD She and her colleagues plan to study this in more detail in the future PERIOD

The results suggest that people with low selfesteem could make better use of social networking sites to get the acceptance they desire she said PERIOD The fact that they feel comfortable disclosing on Facebook
