One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

NEW YORK  Saturdays Field Day Music Festival was a success for merely taking place PERIOD After weeks of legal squabbles promoters were forced to condense the twoday superstarbilled campingconcert extravaganza into a oneday affair and move it from a grassy field in Calverton N.Y. to stoic Giants Stadium in East Rutherford N.J PERIOD Disappointed fans showed up from all over the world to endure a days worth of rain for the likes of Radiohead the Beastie Boys Beck and more PERIOD And while the rain dampened spirits for most of the day Radioheads closing set erased all misgivings PERIOD

The fests expected  attendance was radically downsized in the move to Jersey and the event seemed justifiably disorganized given the short prep time PERIOD Failure on the part of the state of New York and Suffolk County to supply enough security necessitated the move and the crowds displeasure reared its head when a Fuck Suffolk Tshirt drew a large cheer when shown on the two jumbo screens PERIOD

Some of the fests most anticipated acts were lost in its abridgement including such as Sigur Ros and Interpol and most of its hiphop contingent including the Roots N.E.R.D PERIOD and the Streets PERIOD Still as if this was not enough an official came on a minute before Becks set was to start to announce that Mr PERIOD Hansen took a spill backstage and was hospital bound PERIOD

Worried about riots I was PERIOD But the rainsoaked crowd took it in stride instead throwing their enthusiasm on an extended Beasties Boys set list PERIOD Drawing most of the songs off their  record Hello Nasty and completely avoiding oldschool classic License to Ill PERIOD With the rain finally stopping five minutes into their set the middleaged rappers performed an unscripted highwire act PERIOD Yet even as the boys stopped to repair mistakes and lost memories they kept it ill PERIOD

Earlier performances featured all too brief sets Beth Orton Spiritualized Liz Phair energetic second stage performances Ours Thursday and the thumping techno of Underworld that brought life to the ponchoclad spectators PERIOD A cheerfully clumsy performance by Elliott Smith and Blurs Britpop explosion highlighted the rest of the days activities PERIOD But in the end the night belonged to headliners Radiohead PERIOD

Throughout their two hour set Thom Yorke and members leaned on  new LP Hail to the Thief starting with the bassy percussion of single There There. even with the album not officially being released until Tuesday the crowd cheered loudly as they recognized each new track forcing Yorke to joyfully bemoan Everyone comes up to me saying Great record. its not out yet The startlingly beautiful newbie Sail to the Moon brought a blissful hush over the crowd only outdone by the violent loudsoft interchange of Paranoid Android. with Yorkes cries of Rain down rain down  Come on rain down on me the early flow of despised water received a welcome invitation from the entranced crowd PERIOD
