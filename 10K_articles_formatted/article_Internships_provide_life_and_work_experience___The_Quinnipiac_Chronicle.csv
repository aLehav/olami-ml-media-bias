Every year thousands of students choose to take part in an internship program at their school PERIOD
An internship provides a student with an inside look into life after college PERIOD
It gives them the opportunity to experience the real world and gain firsthand knowledge of the profession they will be entering into when they graduate PERIOD
Quinnipiac junior Stephanie LeBow has done just that PERIOD
LeBow got an internship at Weber Shandwick Worldwide is a public relations firm in Manhattan where she hopes to work when she graduates PERIOD
Weber Shandwick deals with consumer marketing public affairs and crisis management and the firm is located on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan PERIOD
LeBow began her internship when she was  years old PERIOD
To get the internship she met with the head of Human Resources which is the person that does the hiring in most companies and submitted her resume PERIOD
It was a whole new experience for me said LeBow PERIOD
While interning at Weber Shandwick Worldwide she gained valuable experiences PERIOD  During her days there she would help with things bookkeeping going to consumer events research and making pitch calls to publications PERIOD
I also got experience sitting in on conference calls and going to meetings said LeBow PERIOD
I did a lot of work with companies such as Qtips and Dunkin Donuts said LeBow PERIOD
About every two weeks the company would do something called lunch and learns for interns PERIOD
At these lunch and learns people from different parts of the company would teach aspects of the firm and public relations to the interns while they ate using PowerPoint and videos PERIOD
The lunch and learns were a great experience because they gave me the opportunity to learn new things said LeBow PERIOD
Having an internship provides students with a totally different experience than what they receive in the classroom PERIOD
I got hands on experience working there and I learned to interact with other professionals in the same field said LeBow PERIOD
The knowledge that LeBow gained was another important lesson while having an internship PERIOD
For my internship I had to commute to the city said Lebow PERIOD It was a  minute commute and I had to wake up at  a.m PERIOD and get dressed in work attire. lebow said that she sat on the train into the city every day drinking coffee and reading the paper like everyone around her was doing
This was an experience that taught LeBow that having a job is much different than rolling out of bed and going to class in pajamas PERIOD
 The experience LeBow gained while working at Weber Shandwick was priceless PERIOD
It showed me the skills that I needed to posses in order to be in this field said Lebow PERIOD It made me realize that public relations is what I want to do. the Student News Site of Quinnipiac University
