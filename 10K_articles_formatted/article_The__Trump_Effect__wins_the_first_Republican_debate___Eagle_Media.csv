The Trump Effect was in full force last night at the first Republican debate for nomination of the  presidential election PERIOD
The debate started out rough with the moderators asking the Republicans on the stage to take a pledge to support the eventual nominee and not run independent PERIOD
Who was the only person that refused this pledge
You guessed it it was Mr PERIOD Donald Trump PERIOD
I cant write this without admitting one thing Donald Trump won the debate last night. the reason Trump so easily won the debate was due to the fact that the Fox News moderators had seemingly loaded questions for Trump PERIOD They asked him about his bankruptcy his racy comments his lack of experience and especially his lack of commitment to the GOP and conservative values PERIOD
Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush speaks during the prime time Republican presidential primary debate on August   at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland Ohio PERIOD
What happened last night was something I didnt think was possible PERIOD Trump made me a partial believer PERIOD What the moderators of last nights debate did was give Trump a great opportunity to defend his positions and he did a great job PERIOD
The truth of the matter is if Trump didnt get these loaded questions and they had asked him complicated policyrelated questions instead of silly jabs about political gaffes and rhetoric then maybe it would have gone another way PERIOD
I walked away from the debate last night with a new impression of Trump a much more favorable one I might add PERIOD Trump let his funny side come out at the debate and he was so natural on stage that it was difficult not to admire some of his answers PERIOD
On the other hand though Trump is still Trump PERIOD If Trump truly wants to lead the United States of America he is going to have to do a lot more than show he can give a snappy comeback and a tough attitude PERIOD
Whenever Trump is asked how or why or show us some proof he can never deliver PERIOD
What I would need to see from Trump is some measure of humility and loyalty PERIOD We didnt see that last night and it didnt go unnoticed PERIOD After the debate Frank Luntz held a focus group and this group was overwhelmingly turned off by Trump PERIOD Trump was quick to take to Twitter to hurl insults at Luntz telling him his focus groups are faulty. sorry there are no polls available at the moment PERIOD
While I was surprised by the focus group I wouldnt call the reaction faulty. i saw many of those same reactions last night as I observed the faces in the room PERIOD Trump doesnt have the humility and loyalty that conservative voters seek PERIOD Donald Trump needs to understand that he has to make himself someone that everyone feels like they can trust PERIOD While he may tout the fact that hes used bankruptcy to get around paying bankers as business savvy many conservatives can easily view it as underhanded PERIOD
Trump has a point though Trump always has a point which is why hes doing so well PERIOD
Were currently in the ballpark of  trillion in debt and we do need someone to straighten it out. however Im not so sure that business savvy is all you need when it comes to the finances of not only our great nation but all of the international organizations we fund and partner with PERIOD
If Donald Trump asked me today how he could earn my vote I would tell him he needs to prove to me that he can do more than talkanddo more than just take action PERIOD I need Donald to show that he can listen PERIOD Nobody wants a President who doesnt listen to his advisors doesnt listen to congress and doesnt listen to the American people PERIOD Trumps supporters and those that admire him do so because of his tenacity his ruthlessness and his willingness to effect change PERIOD Thats a double edged sword to a lot of folks who want a president they can trust not to betray their interests PERIOD
The negatives about Trump are known he doesnt try to hide them and the moderators brought them all up last night PERIOD I think we need to focus the remainder of the debates on what these candidates actually plan on doing once they become president and how they plan to do it PERIOD
If Donald Trump were excluded from the polls Jeb Bush would be the leader without question PERIOD The same goes for the debate PERIOD Bush acted nothing short of presidential PERIOD He didnt spar with the other Republicans too heavily and he stuck to his record and his policy points beautifully PERIOD
In the eyes of many people Bush did win the debate due to the poise and character he displayed PERIOD Bushspoke eloquently and responded to each question with answers basically straight from his platform and videos online PERIOD No gaffes or blunders Bush would have easily had this debate PERIOD
Like Trump though Bushs best quality is his major downfall PERIOD It would have been really nice to see Jeb get fired up last night PERIOD It would have been just as nice as if Trump had shown a softer more trustworthy side PERIOD
Bush didnt get overly passionate which wouldnt normally even be a problem in these early debates but when you have to share the stage with Trump whos being given loaded Trumpcentered questions how can you get noticed
Rand Paul was another person I took specific notice of last night PERIOD
Chris Christie left mocks Rand Pauls stance on government surveillance PERIOD
Paulgot into heated debate with Chris Christie regarding bulk data collection and NSA spying PERIOD
Paul showed passion which I like PERIOD
Paul has always been a passionate candidate and has courageously taken on a lot of biggovernment programs without a lot of help PERIOD Pauls only problem last night is that Christie has the experience of  to defend his policies and Paul was unable to respond effectively at times due to this PERIOD
Scott Walker John Kasich Ben Carson Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee all did equally well and I believe all showed they had the ability to debate and appear presidential PERIOD None of these candidates stood out though PERIOD Its hard to stand out when Trump spoke for  minutes and most of the others spoke for less than sevenminutes PERIOD
One thing is certain from last nights debate PERIOD Everyone had better get used to Donald Trump for the foreseeable future PERIOD Lets hope that the next debate we can get some more time spent on important issues to let the candidates get down to the nuts and bolts of their policy platforms instead of focusing on rhetoric gaffes and political games PERIOD
