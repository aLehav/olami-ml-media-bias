4093,2021-02-25,"when I was a kid I would take a bowl into the backyard and create potions. id muddle together rocks flowers grass  anything I could find and mix them with water to create my magical elixirs PERIOD Ive always been fascinated with this kind of pseudoalchemy mixing different ingredients together to create something entirely original PERIOD Now that Im  Ive moved on to creating more  digestible elixirs cocktails PERIOD When I have the time I love mixing complicated drinks that feel more or less like Im that 5yearold kid creating some kind of potion PERIOD Only a 5yearold whos about to get a buzz going PERIOD This blackberryjalapeo margarita fits that bill and the end product is far more delicious than any dirtandgrass drink I made when I was  PERIOD

While most margaritas use tequila as their base this one uses mezcal a spirit mainly produced in Oaxaca Mexico PERIOD Both tequila and mezcal are made by fermenting the hearts of the agave plant in water PERIOD However in the production of mezcal the agave undergoes an extra step before fermentation cooking PERIOD The agave hearts are baked for days in pits dug in the ground similar to the process used for barbacoa PERIOD This extra step gives the end product a delicious smoky flavor that in my opinion puts it a step above tequila PERIOD
