Beginning Thursday Feb PERIOD  Capital University will host A Midwinters Tale originally a film by Kenneth Branagh that has never been staged before PERIOD

The film has been adapted for the Cabaret Theatre by Bill Kennedy a Capital University theatre professor PERIOD

I had seen A Midwinters Tale and really enjoyed it and turns out Dr PERIOD Dan Heaton and I are both really big fans of it said Kennedy PERIOD

After throwing around several ideas Kennedy began the process of getting permission from Branagh himself PERIOD

I wrote to the studio where he was filming and sent my usual pitch of Its a small college program and Im trying to give students new experiences and Id like to do this said Kennedy PERIOD I usually expect them to say no. but this time they didnt PERIOD

A few weeks after approval Kennedy received a letter from Branagh telling him to go ahead and adapt his movie for the stage PERIOD Kennedy spent the entire summer writing the show to be performed during Capital Universitys one hundredth year in theater PERIOD

Several things were changed in the switch from screen to stage such as moving the town from England to New York removing the English slang and rearranging the scenes in a way that would make sense on stage PERIOD Kennedy also wanted to modernize it PERIOD

The big thing that did not exist when the movie came out were cell phones PERIOD A whole element of the plot is that they keep going out to a phone booth to make phone calls and I thought thats not going to work said Kennedy PERIOD

Students in the play look forward to bringing the film to the stage for the first time PERIOD

Its kind of awesome said firstyear Katie Haught who plays Mrs PERIOD Branch PERIOD It kind of gives us the liberty to add our own touch to it. this show has also brought several theatre alumni back to the Cabaret stage PERIOD

R.J PERIOD Shuman alumnus was excited to work on this production as he loved the movie PERIOD

The movie came out my senior year when I was doing all of my theatre nerd stuff here said Shuman PERIOD I actually saw it at the Drexel. this show also incorporated fight choreography choreographed by alumni Doug and Erin Gibbons which includes swords PERIOD

I was very nervous about it but its turned out to be one of the coolest experiences Ive had on stage said Cedric Gegel junior PERIOD
