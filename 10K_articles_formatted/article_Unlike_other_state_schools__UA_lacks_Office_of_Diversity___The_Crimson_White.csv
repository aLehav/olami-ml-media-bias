7955,2021-03-13,"unlike other universities throughout the state including Auburn University and the other University of Alabama System schools The University of Alabama does not have an official Office of Diversity PERIOD Instead the University has opted to facilitate the same functions through the Crossroads Community Center where students can collaborate and promote diversity PERIOD

George Daniels a journalism professor at the University said the Crossroads Center was thought up as a central organization in place of an official office PERIOD

At least five years ago there was a discussion about whether we should have a cultural center or some type of centralized unit in the space of Foster Auditorium and the consensus was that the best way to handle that was to have a cultural center but use the Ferguson Center as that space Daniels said PERIOD It became the Crossroads Center. the Crossroads Community Center sponsors and promotes programming on diversity for the University PERIOD

I know that we are doing the same things that offices of diversity do on other campuses because Im in a Southeastern Multicultural Network Lane McLelland director of the Crossroads Community Center said PERIOD

Several other organizations like Spectrum the Womens Resource Center and Capstone Alliance work to promote diversity as well PERIOD

What I think is really good about the way The University of Alabama approaches diversity is that we dont just make it the responsibility of an office of diversity McLelland said PERIOD This office along with many other folks on campus does the kinds of things that people associate with an office of diversity. the absence of a central office does have its drawbacks McLelland said PERIOD Some students do not know the responsibilties and duties of Crossroads PERIOD

Many people think the University doesnt have an office of diversity just because they dont know what Crossroads does McLelland said PERIOD We are in the Division of Community Affairs and thats also what confuses people sometimes because frequently the office of diversity is in Student Affairs. daniels said that in not aligning directly as an office of diversity Crossroads is allowed to have a broad reach PERIOD

Diversity is a term that isvery loaded Daniels said PERIOD It can mean a lot of things PERIOD I think in the south sometimes diversity is a euphemism for black and white. while many schools have centers of diversity with racial markers like Black Affairs or Hispanic Relations the consensus at the University was to have a broadbased approach and to have the center be a part of Community Affairs Daniels said PERIOD

The key to that success though is not a room or a physical space it is the network that is connected to the space Daniels said PERIOD Because supporting the diversity mission of the University doesnt happen in one office or one space it happens throughout the University in all divisions in all departments. attached to the Crossroads Center is the Crossroads Network a group of students faculty and staff who discuss diversity issues and plan and promote events related to diversity PERIOD Some of their projects include the campuswide celebrations of African American Heritage Month and LatinoHispanic Heritage Month PERIOD

It allows to look at diversity beyond race  because thats typically the marker race  but also to look at religion or no religion because thats also a type of diversity to look at aspects of class or sexual orientation Daniels said PERIOD

In his  years at the University Daniels said he has noticed changes in the way diversity is handled on campus PERIOD

I think the discussions are greater in number but they are still too crisisdriven and by that I mean we talk about something when a problem arises he said PERIOD That shouldnt be the case PERIOD This should be part of our everyday discussion and our everyday activities. the Network met twice a month up until last year when it went on a temporary hiatus due to leadership change PERIOD It will meet again on Tuesday from noon1 p.m PERIOD in Ferguson Center Room  PERIOD","Unlike other state schools, UA lacks Office of Diversity â€“ The Crimson White",University of Alabama
