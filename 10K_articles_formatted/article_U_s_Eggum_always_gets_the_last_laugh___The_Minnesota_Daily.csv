As members of the Gophers wrestling team gather in the coaches office Wednesday afternoon the tone shifts and the razzing begins PERIOD The debate involves Brandon Eggums current nicknames  and its the 177pound sophomore against everyone else PERIOD
Overhearing the ruckus Minnesotas coach J Robinson laughs out loud and continues on to explain the scene PERIOD
The guys love to tease him PERIOD The thing about him is that he is so honest what people say he believes Robinson said PERIOD That allows his buddies to suck him in on anything  and they love it. although Eggum said he would prefer that his nicknames remain a secret his straightforward personality is clearly evident when he speaks about wrestling PERIOD In his second season starting for the Gophers Eggum is  and ranked fifth in the nation weighing in at  pounds PERIOD While gaining acclaim the Gophers sturdy sophomore keeps his early success in perspective PERIOD
Its nice to look at my record and see that I have zero losses but I dont measure myself up with my record Eggum said PERIOD I measure myself up with the people I wrestle. this weekend at the National Duals Championship Meet Iowa City Iowa Eggum could meet three of the top four contenders in his weight class PERIOD Secondranked Aaron Simpson Arizona State thirdranked John Withrow Pittsburgh and fourthranked John Van Doren Lehigh are expected to compete at  pounds for their respective teams PERIOD
While Eggum has dominated most of his open and dual meet opponents so far this season he has gained invaluable experience wrestling his own highly ranked teammates everyday in the Gophers practice room PERIOD Hes used to being challenged and actually prefers it over winning an easy match PERIOD
I get less nervous when Im wrestling guys ranked above me because I feel less pressure Eggum said PERIOD Its a little more exciting trying to go out there and knock someone off. as Eggum continues to add winning marks to his record the number of higherranked opponents in his weight class is decreasing PERIOD
Eggum began the season at No PERIOD  at  pounds and has moved up five places as a result of his spotless record PERIOD Robinson thinks that Eggum as a sophomore already possesses several advantages over his 177pound opponents PERIOD
Physically hes way above everyone else Robinson said PERIOD Hes got power speed and balance  hes got it all PERIOD Hes what you might call a total package kid. being bigger and stronger than a majority of his opponents has given Eggum an edge in competition but its not his only weapon PERIOD Devoted to improvement through continuous practice and training Eggum almost seems addicted to the grueling sport PERIOD
Wrestling is always on my mind Eggum said PERIOD If Im in the wrestling room Im thinking about trying to get better PERIOD A lot of times Im thinking about it when Im at home or wherever trying to eat better and get more rest  anything to make myself a better wrestler. that foresight has led the Gophers sophomore to envision this season in the bestcase scenario PERIOD For Eggum as for almost every Division I wrestler the ultimate goal is a national title PERIOD
You take it one match at a time but when its over if I could be undefeated that would be a great accomplishment for the year Eggum said PERIOD Thats something that I think is possible if I wrestle well and things work my way. although his trusting personality has made him a victim of harmless ridicule from his teammates and coaches Eggum  just like he does on the mat  usually has a counterattack already in mind PERIOD
Hes also got a quick wit about him that hell get you back Robinson said PERIOD Hell nail you in the end. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
