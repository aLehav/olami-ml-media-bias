Nurses and social workers work closely together when taking care of families PERIOD

Judy Leflore Nursing associate dean for simulation and technology was awarded a government grant worth  in  to integrate social work and nursing curriculum according to a news release at UTA PERIOD

We decided that since we had the money we had the opportunity to give our students the chance to work together like that in a safe environment before they go out and figure out how to do it in the real world Leflore said PERIOD

Nurse practitioners take care of the medical health care side of patients and their families and social workers deal with problems within a family such as crisis and abuse Leflore said PERIOD

In the pediatric world nurse practitioners and physicians work closely with social workers to handle complex families she said PERIOD

Nursing and social work faculty hired real actors and used baby mannequins as patients for the simulations PERIOD The scenarios are a combination of what students have learned throughout the semester PERIOD

Last year was the first time nursing and social work faculty created the simulations PERIOD They wanted to focus on pediatric patients and their families so they brought in experts to lecture the content PERIOD

We decided to focus on child abuse simulations this year Leflore said PERIOD Last year we brought in child abuse experts but the students liked the simulations so much we decided to integrate the content. nurse practitioner Mary McDonald performed a child abuse simulation Friday PERIOD She said there were legal implications to the information they could give a patient and was glad to learn how to do that properly PERIOD

It makes you nervous McDonald said PERIOD This is something that I routinely do but it feels way different in a simulation. gail Adorno social work assistant professor said the overall goal is to teach social workers and nurses how to work together for a common goal to improve patient outcomes PERIOD

Simulations are great for providing opportunities in complex cases and how to deal with those situations before you are actually in them Adorno said PERIOD
