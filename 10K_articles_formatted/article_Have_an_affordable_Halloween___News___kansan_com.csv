With candy decorations parties and especially costumes the cost of Halloween can really rack up PERIOD With some effort and research however students can find cheap options PERIOD

The Halloween stores that popped up in the last few weeks offer costumes from about  to  for adults PERIOD

 said Meagan Vestal an employee at the Halloween Express located in the former Borders building on New Hampshire street PERIOD Vestal said the more detail work and accessories a costume has to it the more it will cost PERIOD

This may mean dressing up as a doctor and wearing a set of scrubs instead of Elvis Presley in a bedazzled jumpsuit just to save some cash PERIOD But if a doctor just doesnt cut it there are many cheap options that can serve as the foundation for a costume that just requires a little more imagination and added accessories PERIOD

Katelyn Boehler a junior from Overland Park said she searches online for cheap Halloween costumes but also has a large collection of old costumes from high school that she can choose from PERIOD

 Boehler said PERIOD

Of course for those people who have a specific unique idea in mind creating a Halloween persona from scratch can be beneficial PERIOD Some of the best costumes are those the wearer scrounged up from friends closets and usedclothes stores PERIOD

 Brandy Stratton buyer for Arizona Trading Company on Massachusetts street said PERIOD

The people who are willing to do a little work have the potential for great costumes PERIOD Often the best and most admired costumes are made from scratch PERIOD
