Content warning the following article includes discussion of suicide PERIOD

As I walked into Gannett Theater on May  my friend and I were greeted by Johnny Esposito  PERIOD He asked us to each take two items from his box PERIOD His instructions were that when he said the number corresponding to my items I was to read what my item said aloud PERIOD On a scrap of paper I had  PERIOD The even numbered Star Trek films and on a packet of oatmeal I had  PERIOD Really good oranges. these two items make up the eponymous list at the center of Every Brilliant Thing a play by Duncan Macmillan and Jonny Donahoe PERIOD As part of an Independent Study in Performance and Production Esposito spent his Short Term rehearsing to bring this hourlong oneman show to life PERIOD

The character of Every Brilliant Thing goes unnamed so lets just call him Johnny for simplicitys sake PERIOD When Johnny was seven his mother attempted suicide for the first time PERIOD To cheer her up he decided to make a list of everything that was brilliant about the world PERIOD If brilliant feels like an odd word to use here rather than say wonderful its because Macmillan is British. johnnys story begins there the night of his mothers first attempt all the way through to the present day sometime after his mothers death she does not survive her third attempt PERIOD It chronicles Johnnys changing relationship with the list and his own mental health PERIOD Stories from his life are interspersed with facts about suicide such as Samaritans an international suicide prevention organization media reporting guidelines that get broken rather frequently PERIOD

In many ways Every Brilliant Thing was a perfect culmination of Espositos Bates experience PERIOD A theater playwriting and psychology double major Esposito is passionate about mental health especially in male populations PERIOD Several of the plays hes written examine suicide but not from the perspective of Every Brilliant Thing. in addition to writing Esposito has also acted in several Bates productions PERIOD His  turn in The Zoo Story directed by Nicky Longo  prepared him to command attention he had to deliver a 20minute monologue in a 60minute play with only one other actor to bounce off of PERIOD Taking on the oneman show was simply the next step in that journey PERIOD

Except Every Brilliant Thing is not a traditional oneman show PERIOD In addition to the audience shouting out their brilliant things several members of the audience actually join in on the action PERIOD Every performance is different with Esposito telling me he decided who to use based on who is in the room PERIOD

At my performance my roommate Becca Vaules  was the first victim playing the veterinarian who puts down Johnnys dog in his first experience with death PERIOD Miles Hagedorn  played the sockpuppetweidling counselor Johnny sees as a child PERIOD Jiayi Yang  played a college professor who teachers The Sorrows of Young Werther the book spawned the naming of the Werther effect or suicides going up after a highly publicized one PERIOD Frances White  played Sam Johnnys first love and exwife PERIOD And in a bit of truly inspired casting Espositos father played Johnnys dad PERIOD

Esposito told me that the play is written in such a way that it is not true improv working against the audienceactors whose improvisations tend to follow a similar pattern due to the constraints Johnny presents them PERIOD Every interaction though felt genuine PERIOD It was fun to see the audience join in from the touching speech Espositos father gave at Johnnys wedding to Hagedorns sock puppet to Yangs impassioned reading of the back cover of The Sorrows of Young Werther to Sams perusal of a Maine cookbook at the library PERIOD

Espositos performance was magnetic PERIOD He commanded the stage with authority yet still managed to put everyone even his audienceactors at ease PERIOD I saw at least one person shed a tear and came quite close to it myself at a couple points PERIOD Esposito and codirector Robby Haynos  crafted a joyful uplifting production that even in its darkest moments showed the strength and resilience of humanity PERIOD

Johnny gives advice to anyone contemplating suicide dont do it. after two years of pandemic slog and violence seemingly everywhere finding anything to be happy about or hopeful for can feel mindnumbingly hard PERIOD But Every Brilliant Thing is a wonderful reminder of the small joys of life PERIOD

After the show I wrote down some of my own brilliant things for Esposito to dump out at the end of the next performance PERIOD Id seen the call for people to do so earlier in Short Term but had no idea what to say so I didnt contribute any PERIOD But after sitting in community with everyone in Gannett for an hour I wrote at least five PERIOD at least  Getting to see Esposito shine one last time PERIOD
