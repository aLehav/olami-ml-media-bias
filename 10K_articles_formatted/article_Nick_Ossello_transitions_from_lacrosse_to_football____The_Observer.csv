Benjamin Padanilam  Thursday November  

Playing football at Notre Dame is a dream for a lot of high school studentathletes PERIOD For graduate student safety Nick Ossello however that dream became a reality this season PERIOD

A midfielder for the Irish lacrosse team the last four seasons Ossello was a standout player in both football and lacrosse at Wheat Ridge High School in Wheat Ridge Colorado just west of Denver PERIOD Although he was recruited as a lacrosse player he said he had always dreamed of playing football at the college level PERIOD

I had wanted to be a football player my entire life and after signing here to play lacrosse I didnt think that I would ever get that opportunity Ossello said PERIOD Then luckily enough I was able to make the team. with his collegiate lacrosse career over Ossello learned of an NCAA rule that allows graduate students to gain a fifth year of eligibility in a second sport PERIOD Having received allstate honors as a football player in high school he decided to pursue that dream once again PERIOD After successfully walking on to the team Ossello then began the difficult transition from lacrosse to football PERIOD

While the transition has certainly been rewarding it has also had its challenges Ossello said PERIOD Much like lacrosse Ossello said the test of going up against elite college athletes  except now it is in a sport he has not played for four years  has been one of the most difficult parts of making the transition PERIOD

Pretty much the challenge is just going up against incredible athletes every day Ossello said PERIOD While Im very appreciative of that it does absolutely have its challenges both mentally and physically PERIOD It has been challenging but the most rewarding experience Ive had in my life. fortunately he has been blessed with the guidance of both coaches and players during the transition Ossello said PERIOD

The first coach that I became fairly close with here was Coach Todd Lyght and he kind of helped me out in my transition Ossello said of the Irish secondary coach PERIOD I would be asking him some dumb rookie questions and he would take the time to answer them and kind of helped me through the original transition from having a lacrosse to a football mindset and I was very appreciative of that PERIOD

Matthias Farley also helped me out a lot PERIOD I knew him before coming into this year and he was very helpful and just kind of helped me out with the transition. all of that hard work culminated into one moment for Ossello running out of the tunnel against Texas to take the field for the first time PERIOD

The first time that I ran out on the field against Texas particularly the tunnel that was probably the most memorable moment of my life Ossello said PERIOD Running out of that tunnel was really just an incredible experience PERIOD I wish I had the words to describe what that meant to me and how that felt but I havent found them yet. since then the experience has been the ride of a lifetime for him PERIOD Besides joking about getting a chance at being the starting quarterback there isnt much that he would change about his time with the team Ossello said PERIOD

I unfortunately had a couple of minor injuries that set me back a little bit but you kind of take what you have and work with what you have Ossello said PERIOD It was a very humbling experience and I think I learned a lot PERIOD I will be very appreciative of that in the coming years. of all the experiences he has enjoyed and will continue to enjoy as the season goes on Ossello said the camaraderie with his teammates will be what he misses the most when it is all said and done PERIOD

Ill miss the locker room and just kind of watching everybody interact and just making friends and seeing how everybody  whether youre having a bad day or whether youre having a good day  can come in and know that the guys on the team will be there to have your back and be there to cheer you up and help you get through a long day or make a good day even better Ossello said PERIOD So just being around the guys and seeing how happy you know just how much of a brotherhood it is really is something Im gonna miss. as he prepares for life after college however Ossello said he has several opportunities available to him and plans to give them all a try and see how it turns out PERIOD

Im going through the interview process with a couple companies right now two financial ones and then a group purchasing organization Ossello said PERIOD I see myself whereverwhichever job offers me or whichever one makes the best offer PERIOD

I was fortunate enough to be drafted by some professional lacrosse teams the Denver Outlaws for outdoor and then the Georgia Swarm for indoor so Ill give that a shot see how that goes and then hopefully Ill convince some poor woman to marry me and start a family and have a great time. share This Story
