Mortal Kombat  continues the revamp of the Mortal Kombat series that began with the ninth installment PERIOD While its not the best game to come out this year it keeps the series going PERIOD Mortal Kombat has been around for over a decade so even if its newest game doesnt quite impress there will still be a market for it among the hardcore fans PERIOD It plays on the nostalgia for the series original diverse cast of characters  at least those who remain such as SubZero Scorpion Sonya and Kitana  and contains the same elements of extreme character bodies violence gore and intense finishing moves PERIOD In this newest release there are many changes  some controversial and some more welcome PERIOD Overall Kombat is now more grindy the controls are slightly less responsive and characters have been changed to appear more realistic in an ultraunrealistic fighting game PERIOD Despite these setbacks Mortal Kombat  has superb graphics PERIOD The fighting moves are on point with the violence and gore that one would expect from another Mortal Kombat game PERIOD It also has a blast from the past story and comes with some new additions that no other Mortal Kombat game has yet tried PERIOD

Story

NetherRealm the developer behind the renewed Mortal Kombat series has accomplished something that other fighting games often lack  a good storyline PERIOD The story picks up where Mortal Kombat X ended PERIOD Raiden a peacekeeper who had previously altered time has become hostile PERIOD Now the keeper of time Kronika decides to eliminate Raiden by bringing forth all of the characters from Mortal Kombat  through a tear in time itself PERIOD These oldschool characters get a makeover as they cross paths with presentday characters setting up some very intriguing interactions PERIOD Players dont usually purchase a fighting game for a gripping story but it is always exciting to see one from the genre PERIOD

Aesthetics

With this emphasis on story NetherRealm relies on long cutscenes throughout Mortal Kombat . those who are not fans of cutscenes will not be excited when they realize that a large part of the story campaign is meant to be watched like a movie PERIOD This does not mean that the hyperrealistic graphics flash and content are not enough to retain an audience PERIOD Characters are beautifully rendered without looking completely out of place or scary like in L.A PERIOD Noire. additionally NetherRealm decided to relinquish their former overly sexualized female characters for more proportionate bodies PERIOD The change could receive praise if it werent for the continued exaggeration of the male form in pretty boy characters like Johnny Cage or grotesque characters like Baraka PERIOD The male body types in this game are universally and uncharacteristically muscular PERIOD

Combat

Attack options seem to be quite basic in Mortal Kombat  compared to its predecessors PERIOD The earliest renditions of the game required players to memorize combinations of moves without a detailed fighting guide PERIOD This forced players to become more strategic with their gameplay and began to craft an innate skill set that those players employed in Mortal Kombat and other fighting games PERIOD

The animations of the current move sets are actually quite fantastic PERIOD The movement is fluid and wellintegrated with combat PERIOD The combination of button clicks needed to accomplish a certain move may be a bit simplistic but the visual transitions from move to move could be likened to the practiced choreography of a dance PERIOD

Dialogue

In the same manner as the past two Mortal Kombat games this sequel tries to bring a certain life to characters that might otherwise lack depth PERIOD Before rounds begin the two characters facing off exchange a few lines of dialogue PERIOD This helps to establish the relationship of these characters as well as set up the premise for that bout PERIOD What makes this so exciting is that the dialogue given is often personal between the two characters playing off of their past histories and connections within the Mortal Kombat universe and rewarding longtime fans that have invested time in the series PERIOD Although this is not inherently new to fighting games in general what NetherRealm has brought to forefront of this game will be seen in many future games PERIOD

Verdict 

All these changes that NetherRealm has made not only in Mortal Kombat  but also throughout the Mortal Kombat series are sure to affect the fighting game genre going forward PERIOD Despite a number of flaws with the new game many would still consider it as enjoyable and a perfectly adequate installment within the franchise PERIOD Mortal Kombat  came out this past April  published by Warner Bros PERIOD Interactive Entertainment for the PC Xbox One PS4 and Nintendo Switch PERIOD If you are looking for a new fighting game to pass the time it might be best to wait until this title is a bit more affordable PERIOD
