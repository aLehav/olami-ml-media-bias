Ruby Draayer Assistant Sports Editor of The Daily Mississippian

Ahead of Tennessees week seven matchup against SEC West foe Ole Miss The Daily Beacon sat down with The Daily Mississippians assistant sports editor Ruby Draayer to talk about Saturdays potentially explosive matchup PERIOD

Question Kiffin returns to Knoxville Saturday PERIOD Neyland is going to be rocking PERIOD Do you think Ole Miss is ready for the noise

Answer Its interesting to see how the offense and defense will react PERIOD With so much hype I think theyll be okay PERIOD Ive heard when youre playing a game you just tune everything out and I think theyll be able to do that PERIOD The checkerout will be really cool to see. q Staying on the topic of Kiffin would you say the attention hes gotten this week is a positive or a negative for Ole Miss when concerning a matchup with his former team

A I cant speak for Tennessee fans but from an Ole Miss perspective Id say its pretty positive PERIOD Everyone is excited to see what he is capable of PERIOD Im sure when he comes out of the field he will get a few boos but overall I can see it being a pretty positive reaction from a mindset point of view. q What does the Rebels defense have to do to keep up on Saturday after struggling out of the gate to avoid a shootout

A I would hope that Ole Miss doesnt put themselves in another shootout position following last week against Arkansas PERIOD The most important part with Ole Miss is the defense PERIOD Theres been a lot of disappointment with how the defense has performed so far this year in their  defense PERIOD I think that the defense is there they just have to execute PERIOD They need to get the offense off the field on third down PERIOD Arkansas was very effective on third down last week and that cant happen again especially in Ole Miss territory. q Tennessee isnt ranked but its safe to say it is a middletier SEC team this season with a potent offense PERIOD What does a win do for the Rebels moving forward

AThe Tennessee team in general has looked dominant so far this season PERIOD I think thats surprising with a firstyear head coach with the violations and transfers that Tennessee has been dealing with PERIOD They look really good PERIOD A lot of fans thought that this was going to be an easy win but winning in a tough atmosphere like Neyland against a good Tennessee team would be huge for the Rebels morale PERIOD With it being so tight right now in the SEC West a win would certainly propel Ole Miss to a good spot PERIOD

Q How are special teams looking for the Rebels this season

A So Im a big special teams fan and I think its the most underrated part of a teams success PERIOD Ole Miss hopes they wont punt much but Matt Brown in his fifth year is phenomenal PERIOD I feel very confident that Ole Miss has the upper hand in the special teams unit PERIOD And they have a kicker that actually makes his field goals something they havent had in the past. q What can Tennessee do to get an edge Saturday What can Ole miss do to achieve the same

A I think Tennessee and Ole Miss are in the same boat PERIOD Neither quarterback has thrown an interception this year when it counts Hooker threw one in desperation against Pitt. i do think we are probably going to see a few turnovers PERIOD The turnover battle might settle this one its going to be a highscoring affair PERIOD Nobody is taking the under unless youre crazy PERIOD Its going to be a matter of who can turn over the ball and who can get the offense off the field on third down. assistant Sports Editor
