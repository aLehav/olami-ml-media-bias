3637,2018-10-10,"the University census released Sept PERIOD  revealed large increases in transfer and international student populations contributing to peak enrollment at SLU PERIOD 
A crop of new Billikens inundated campus this fall filling residence halls and classrooms to the brim PERIOD These fresh Billikens are contributing to what is now the peak enrollment year at Saint Louis University PERIOD Steady increases in new freshman applicants international students and transfer students have raised questions about how the University is going to adjust to a larger population PERIOD
The University census compiled each year after the fourth week of classes was released on Sept PERIOD  and revealed a steady jump in the number of transfer students and in international students entering the English as a Second Language program PERIOD
A total of  students fill the campus this year which includes graduate professional and undergraduate students PERIOD  Based on  years of data SLU enrollment has been at a steady upward trend over the past  years and  is the peak year said Brett Magill the director of institutional research and data integrity PERIOD
New freshman applicants are categorized based on their status as traditional nontraditional international traditional and international ESL status PERIOD Traditional students include firsttime students and nontraditional students or those entering the Professional Studies or Philosophy and Letters programs PERIOD
New freshman applicants entering the Madrid Spain campus are also included in the overall data PERIOD While total traditional and ESL enrollment has remained steady between  and  the University saw a jump in specific areas of enrollment including transfer and international ESL students PERIOD
Enrollment has always been increasing in a steady stream and it increases in different areas in different years Jean Gilman dean of undergraduate admission siad
Admissions efforts for the  academic year were targeted specifically at transfer students both in St PERIOD Louis as well as outside Midwest feeder cities by adding an additional transfer admissions counselor PERIOD
The efforts from the transfer student center have paid off as this year SLU welcomed  total traditional transfer students compared to  in  PERIOD
Part of the success in growing the student body can be attributed to the highly visible Be a Billiken marketing campaign which rolled out for the  academic year PERIOD
The campaign reflects the relationship formed between the Office of Undergraduate Admission and University Communications PERIOD
Every other year the Office of Undergraduate Admission conducts an admitted student questionnaire to assess why students either did or did not enroll in SLU PERIOD
Students had glowing things to stay about our academic programs but what we were missing was team spirit Gilman said PERIOD
Since its implementation in  the campaign has had a direct impact on enrollment data PERIOD
Total traditional domestic freshmen applicants increased from  in  to  students in  PERIOD As long as the campaign remains successful it will continue to be a part of admissions efforts PERIOD
I dont see it going away in the next year it has helped a lot with enrollment and students seem to love it Gilman said PERIOD
While domestic Billikens are being recruited through the efforts of this campaign the Office of International Services also strove to increase the international student population on campus PERIOD International students both traditional and ESL constitute  students on campus for the  year PERIOD
The amount of international students enrolled in the ESL program continues to spike each year with  new students entering the program in  PERIOD Robert Barry director of international services said that SLU has an outstanding ESL program and that currently the program is comprised of more than  fulltime students and more than  parttime students PERIOD
While the academic programs have risen to meet the demands of more international students strain has been felt in discovering ways to help these students acculturate PERIOD
Barry said that the transformation of Des Peres Hall into a Center for Global Citizenship and the addition of two new acculturation counselors will greatly aid in this process PERIOD
The progression has already begun PERIOD We hope to have everything in place by January and this semester is a transitional one for the program Barry said PERIOD
Barry said he hopes that SLU students and faculty will continue to work together to bring quality international students to the campus PERIOD
The increased trend in international enrollment surfaced after a presidential retreat some years ago where globalization was cited as a key goal and since then the office has been working with a large number of new international students and has also increased its efforts to send students abroad PERIOD
Weve had tremendous support from the students and we hope this will continue Barry said PERIOD
New international and domestic students created strains on the University housing system a vital recruitment point for incoming students PERIOD When total enrollment numbers are considered the housing spaces on campus were certainly tight this year Kent Porterfield vice president for Student Development PERIOD
Universityowned and operated housing is currently at  percent capacity with about  spaces available as of the last assessment PERIOD
To respond to increased demand University housing has made several adjustments including converting larger spaces in several residence halls into rooms that accommodate more students such as converting Reinert Hall from double rooms to triple rooms PERIOD
In  the University started using Manresa Center as overflow housing for the beginning of the year until students could be accommodated in other areas PERIOD
For the  year the major modifications came from the spaces added by the Flats at  and also the oncampus residency requirement for secondyear students PERIOD
By adding the Flats this year weve created greater density over time to raise capacity Porterfield said PERIOD
If enrollment continues on its current slope the University may have to consider adding even more spaces or revoking the residency requirement PERIOD Porterfield said that Student Development is currently working with SGA and RHA on how to manage resident signups for returning students and will make changes for this year based on feedback from last year PERIOD
According to Porterfield the future for SLU housing and enrollment currently resides in speculation based on a projection of current data PERIOD Potential plans for housing could eventually include the reallocation of housing scholarships back over to tuition a change supported by many student leaders PERIOD
Other plans advocate breaking ground on a new residence hall PERIOD  The University has discussed new residence halls a number of times and has even considered some proposals but hasnt been able to identify the right opportunity PERIOD
The student housing issue is important but it is also a facilities issue that has to compete against other projects and be considered in the whole of all of the needs of the University Porterfield said PERIOD
Though housing hasnt made any definitive decisions SLU officials said they expect the current enrollment trends to continue into the  academic year PERIOD
According to Gilman increasing enrollment is not just about numbers PERIOD
We also have a steady increase in the GPA and test scores of our incoming classes Gilman said PERIOD
With a collaborative effort between many University departments to increase the student population the SLU community can continue to expect a steady stream of bright Billikens to arrive on campus each year PERIOD
