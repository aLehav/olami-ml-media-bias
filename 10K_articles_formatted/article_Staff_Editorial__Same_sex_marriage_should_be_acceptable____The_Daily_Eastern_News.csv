The Freedom to Marry campaign received its one hundred thousandth signature on a letter to President Barack Obama to stop federal marriage discrimination for gays and lesbians PERIOD



The campaign deals with a topic that has been debated over for the past decade  samesex marriage PERIOD

This may seem to threaten the fabric of marriage or society as a whole to some but despite negative reactions to the idea samesex marriage is being supported more PERIOD

A DEN article published Tuesday reported that a May  Gallup poll said the majority of Americans support legalizing samesex marriage PERIOD

Throughout the past decade people have changed their opinions and decisions about samesex marriage and along with the changed times and decisions came some changes in federal legislation PERIOD

We at the Daily Eastern News believe that society should consider more change in samesex marriage legislation in order to prevent the discrimination of homosexual couples PERIOD We are against discrimination of any kind PERIOD

According to a New York Times article published in February The Defense on Marriage Act of  outlaws samesex marriage on the federal level PERIOD

The same article said Obama challenged the constitutionality of the Defense on Marriage Act and ordered the Justice Department to not use the act in court PERIOD

Besides the president other people in government have also changed their opinions about samesex marriage PERIOD

A CNN.com article stated in August  that a federal judge in California overturned Proposition  the law that originally banned samesex marriage in the state PERIOD

The article also said the federal judge who claimed Proposition  unconstitutional wrote in his opinion that the law was based on the idea that heterosexual couples were superior than samesex couples PERIOD

This idea of inferiority has been seen throughout time with other discrimination examples and laws have changed to outlaw discrimination PERIOD

Interracial relationships and interracial marriages were illegal at one point in time but society has become more accepting of interracial couples today PERIOD

Race discrimination was prevalent  years ago now gay and lesbian couples are facing discrimination PERIOD

Gay and lesbian couples may seem different from straight couples but we share similar values the Campaign to Marry website stated PERIOD

People should take this statement into consideration in order to change the laws PERIOD

We need to do more for human rights and equal rights and know that others who may be different from us have the right to the pursuit of happiness in this country PERIOD
