Many prospective students visiting Georgetown have entertained the thought of attending a school with active Greek life  serving the community with sorority sisters and squatting for photos or revelling in the testosteronefilled bonds of brotherhood and sporting lax pinnies with fraternity letters PERIOD Yet this image is squelched upon learning that Georgetown lacks any recognized Greek organizations PERIOD

As a Jesuit Catholic institution Georgetown maintains that clubs and activities must be consistent with the university ethos and moral vision PERIOD Among other criteria organizations are only eligible if they allow anyone to join  unless they have obtained special permission  and are not affiliated with a national or local social fraternity or sorority as stated in the Access to Benefits policy PERIOD According to Student Activities Commission Chair Jennifer Chiang SFS  no fraternities or sororities are currently included within SAC PERIOD

The notable exception to this policy is Alpha Phi Omega the coed community service fraternity which has been a recognized student group since  and counts Bill Clinton SFS  among its notable alumni PERIOD According to APO member Pat McCusker COL  the group is recognized as a CSJ student organization for its role as a service group PERIOD

Being in APO has been really good for me because I am really interested in doing service  and it does a really good job of connecting me with other people who are interested in the same things. georgetown is publicly touted as a nonGreek institution however the past few decades have witnessed the growth of a complex network of fraternities and sororities on campus that dont officially belong PERIOD These groups include a myriad of nonofficial nationally affiliated service social preprofessional singlesex and coed brother and sisterhoods PERIOD

I think were home to a Greek community but its far from being a deciding factor in most individuals lives Tane AranaHumphries SFS  vice president of sorority Adelfi said PERIOD Georgetowns Greek culture is very distinct and that is a definite positive. despite obstacles of formal recognition and funding these Greek outlets continue to grow and flourish each year PERIOD Regardless of the universitys official stance it is clear that the student bodys response to the absence of organized Greek life varies significantly PERIOD

At one end of the spectrum some students choose to keep their distance from the Greek culture at Georgetown PERIOD The only Greek influence they desire to be part of their college experience is limited to the linguistic roots of their Hoya identity PERIOD

I honestly do not feel like I am missing anything in my college experience by not going to a school with Greek life except for maybe being harassed by frat boys Kristi Meyering COL  said PERIOD

Yet the growing membership to this subset culture speaks to its appeal for other Hoyas PERIOD Those involved agree that it provides many of the positive qualities associated with Greek life such as tradition bonding service and enrichment PERIOD

While its nothing like that of big state schools or hardcore Greek student bodies like Dartmouth what we have here at Georgetown is still a fantastic way to make great friends and memories Charlie Plissner COL  member of the Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi said I joined AEPi to meet new people and have a good time  and thats exactly what happened. as a testament to the increasing number of oncampus fraternities and sororities Christian Keenum MSB  founded the Georgetown colony of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity last February PERIOD Boasting a commitment to brotherhood and service Keenum acknowledges that SAE doesnt fit the conventional fraternity stereotypes and says that the Georgetown atmosphere creates a unique experience distinct from other universities PERIOD

Like most brothers in our fraternity I had the opportunity to go to a school with a strong Greek system and still chose Georgetown for what it is Keenum said PERIOD With time I believethe Greeklife community will continue to grow steadily while balancing a critical appreciation for ouruniversitysJesuit traditionsandbeliefs. in place of fraternities and sororities many have found that Greek outlets are not the only means to reaping the benefits they characteristically offer PERIOD Further both Greek and nonGreek students enjoy their freedom to pursue involvement in several activities PERIOD From The Corp to sports teams the range of student organizations allow for the opportunity to discover their own niche rather than an identifying threeletter Greek label PERIOD

I found all of those things in my a cappella group in the College Academic Council and when I joined the Blue  Gray tour guide society senior Sydney Schauer COL  said PERIOD In hindsight I think our system is a better one we get to be a part of not just one really tight group but multiple all very close but also very different. special to The Hoya
