Disappointment has become far too familiar for Stony Brooks fall sports teams as the Seawolves have now gone three consecutive years without a conference title in the academic years first season PERIOD On the field on the pitch and on the court the suffering seemed to come from nearly every directionimaginable PERIOD

For the football team the season opened with a  record and a dominating win over the defending Colonial Athletic Association champion and thenNo PERIOD  New Hampshire Wildcats PERIOD It was a statement victory for the Seawolves a  blowout in front of a raucous home crowd at Kenneth P PERIOD LaValle Stadium PERIOD The victory raised expectations on the gridiron to the highest level since the team joined the CAA in  PERIOD

From there the season for head coach Chuck Priores team derailed PERIOD Junior running back Stacey Bedell suffered a shoulder injury in a Week  loss against William  Mary devastating the teams ability to score PERIOD Stony Brook lost five games in a row riddled by injuries and a suffering offense to fall to  and fall out of contention for a potential Football Championship Subdivision playoff spot after a promising start to the year PERIOD

With senior defensive lineman Victor Ochi and junior defensive lineman Aaron Thompson wreaking havoc for the Seawolves Stony Brook finished the regular season first in the FCS in total defense and second in the FCS in team sacks PERIOD Although the team finished at  after winning its final three games one cannot help but wonder what the season could have looked like if the Seawolves vaunted defense was complemented by an equallydominant offense PERIOD

For the mens soccer team sophomore forward Vince Erdei and senior midfielder Martin Giordano combined for  goals on the year creating one of the America East Conferences most potent attacks PERIOD On Oct PERIOD  the team went on the road to topple the thenNo PERIOD  Hofstra Pride  notching the highestranking victory in program history PERIOD At home the squad had a flair for the dramatic as Erdei netted overtime winners against Marist and Binghamton while fellow sophomore forward Thibault Duval booted a doubleovertime goal against Albany PERIOD Stony Brook heroism quickly seemed to become the norm at mens soccer games at LaValle Stadium PERIOD

In the America East quarterfinals the switch was cruelly flipped on the Seawolves PERIOD After Stony Brook took a  lead against Binghamton with just  minutes remaining the Bearcats scored twice in regulation to tie the match PERIOD When Binghamton drilled in a doubleovertime golden goal the Stony Brook players held their heads in disbelief having been victimized by an unimaginable comeback to spoil their season PERIOD

For the womens soccer team redshirt junior forward Raven Edwards took the America East by storm ranking second in the conference with nine goals including eight in an eightmatch span PERIOD On Oct PERIOD  Stony Brook bested the defending champion New Hampshire  at home with Edwards scoring the gamewinning penaltykick goal with three minutes remaining in regulation PERIOD

Entering the final game of the regular season a home match against UMBC Stony Brook needed just a draw to qualify for the playoffs PERIOD The Seawolves had not lost in eight consecutive LaValle Stadium games entering the matchup but the unbeaten streak was snapped in a brutal and untimely way PERIOD Despite leading the  in shot attempts the Seawolves lost the match  missing the playoffs by a single point PERIOD Head coach Sue Ryan was relieved of her coaching duties a few days later PERIOD

For the womens volleyball team senior outside hitter Kathy Fletcher and freshman middle blocker McKyla Brooks were dynamic for Stony Brook offensively with Fletcher leading the America East with  kills and Brooks leading all freshmen in the conference in attack percentage PERIOD The Seawolves set an alltime program record for attack efficiency against Delaware State on Oct PERIOD  when they hit . as a team PERIOD With four seniors as major contributors in the teams rotation Stony Brook seemed poised to make noise in the conference tournament PERIOD

But when the teams playoff match came Stony Brook played perhaps its most underwhelming conference match of the season against its rival Albany in the America East semifinals getting beaten in straightsets after playing two highlycompetitive matches against the Great Danes during the regular season PERIOD

The brightest spot for the Seawolves discouraging fall season came from the cross country team where junior Christina Melian ran away from her peers PERIOD She claimed the womens individual title with a blistering . run at the Stony Brookhosted America East Championship 5K on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD The Staten Islander represented Stony Brook at the NCAA Championships on Nov PERIOD  and now moves to the winter season where she seeks to defend her indoor track AllAmerica status earned last March PERIOD

Across the board however disappointment continued to haunt the Seawolves fall sports teams for yet another year PERIOD The Stony Brook fall seasons again ended in agony PERIOD In  the teams will once again set out to win the fall conference title that has eluded the school since  PERIOD
