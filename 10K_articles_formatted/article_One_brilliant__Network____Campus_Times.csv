Jesse Eisenberg has already gotten oscar buzz over his performance in the recent hit 

Im willing to take Mark Zuckerbergs word that the events behind the founding of Facebook werent nearly as dramatic as portrayed in The Social Network. most college students can only dream of speaking with the reckless wit of Aaron Sorkins screenplay let alone finding themselves entwined in a digitalage There Will Be Blood. but after the films accuracy was a topic of dispute for months the finished product makes concerns about the truth completely irrelevant PERIOD The Social Network is rich with emotional truths  it extracts so much exhilaration and haunting profundity from its source that it towers as a miraculous story in its own right PERIOD

The Social Network cuts between the websites brisk genesis at Harvard and the subsequent legal wrangling that followed  it doesnt mean to just shake our perceptions of how the website was created but also why PERIOD Director David Fincher has crafted superb films based on social misfits and destructive obsessions and hes now created another uncanny masterwork from a most unlikely source PERIOD

Mark Zuckerberg the worlds youngest billionaire and poster boy for all thats amazing and terrible about digital communication is introduced as a case of social interaction gone irreparably wrong PERIOD

In the films opening scene Harvard sophomore Mark Zuckerberg Jesse Eisenberg makes a date with his Boston University girlfriend Erica Rooney Mara go from awkward to selfdestructive at rapidfire speed PERIOD He tosses off scatterbrained conversational threads descends into socially inadequate paranoia and then instinctively belittles Erica when she finally stops trying to keep up with him PERIOD

She dumps him with a line that he quite understandably will never forget Youre going to go through life thinking that girls dont like you because youre a nerd PERIOD And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that wont be true PERIOD Itll be because youre an asshole. his response after a harrowing walk through the darkened Harvard campus is to create Facemash a site where people vote on the relative hotness of Harvards female undergrads his original idea was to compare the girls photos to farm animals PERIOD

The blitzkrieg Facemash sequence in which Zuckerberg drunkenly plows through an expert amount of hacking and coding is the only scene to feature internal monologue from Zuckerberg and Eisenbergs mileaminute voiceover is a brief stunning example of how Zuckerbergs mind can churn at a level no one else comprehends focus on a task with impenetrable nerve and reduce peers to mere means of getting what he wants PERIOD

The Facemash stunts earns him academic probation and widespread female resentment which is a small price to pay for the massive attention he also earns especially from Divya Narendra Max Minghella and the almost comically perfect twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss both played by Armie Hammer  fellow Harvard students who want to enlist him for a Harvardexclusive social network site theyre planning PERIOD Zuckerburg accepts and recruits his loyaltoafault best friend Eduardo Saverin Andrew Garfield almost guaranteed a Best Supporting Actor nomination PERIOD

Zuckerberg secretly picks away at Facebook in his dorm room and launches it with Saverin as its CFO Divya and the Winklevosses immediately start considering the most severe way to nail Zuckerberg for intellectual property theft PERIOD What follows is a mix of familiar stories  Facebooks wildfire launch the involvement of Napster founder Sean Parker Justin Timberlake great at cool braggadocio and eventual global domination  and frenzied disputes about everything in between PERIOD

Sorkin has always been a master at making lengthy passages of dialogue flow like heartracing action and Finchers direction makes the verbal warfare even more captivating perfectly balancing Facebooks hottrend rise with its ugly legal consequences PERIOD The Social Network is outstanding entertainment but repeat viewings make the story even more complex PERIOD This is a rare story where nobody is exactly innocent or guilty  its a story built on miscommuncation and shattered relationships so although it initially seems clear who is right and wrong every characters motivations are worthy of secondguessing PERIOD

The biggest factor in the films endlessly fascinating ambiguity is Eisenberg who takes a quantum leap from his previous awkwardnerd roles to deliver one of the most intricate character studies in several years of film PERIOD Ive heard some viewers describe this Zuckerberg character as an alltoointelligent asshole a lonely soul worthy of sympathy and as an adolescent geektastic version of evil incarnate PERIOD

Whats so great about Eisenberg is that he makes all of those assessments seem accurate but its impossible to tell which is really the case PERIOD

Zuckerberg mostly seems like your typical outcast who dreams of someday doing something to oneup his perceived social superiors PERIOD That keeps even his most heartless actions  and the terrifying hollowedout stare he brings out when hes angry  rooted in the shell of a lonely nerd who just wanted to prove himself PERIOD

The Social Network argues that Facebook isnt really about connecting with other people PERIOD Its the Internets savviest way of secretly feeding into our resentment and jealousy towards peers  in princple basically a much more sophisticated version of Zuckerbergs cruel Facemash prank PERIOD It seems ironic that the Webs most powerful social networking site would come from a friendless social reject but The Social  Network proves that only a person in such a lonely disposition could imagine such an empire of disconnect PERIOD

And the mournful final scene with Zuckerberg left alone in a room clicking away at his own creation begs the films most disturbing question Zuckerbergs idea might have changed the world but who exactly has benefitted from it
