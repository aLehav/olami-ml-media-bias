Updated November     pm





Former Pirate running back Chris Johnson  is ready to get back to his AllPro form with the Titans PERIOD Contributed

Its a point of pride for both student and alumni to be able to turn on their television on a Sunday Monday Thursday or in some cases Saturday and be able to point to a player on the gridiron and say I saw him play at ECU. whether it is a ProBowl superstar of the likes of Chris Johnson or Vontae Leach a middle tier player such as David Garrard or Dwayne Harris or even a player at the bottom of the tank scrapping at the bits likes Lance Lewis diehard ECU fans get amped to see their favorite Pirate alumni strap on an NFL helmet PERIOD We all feel obligated to be a homer and undoubtedly think ECU alumni in the NFL in some cases deserve to be allpro and in others just make a roster spot PERIOD

This season it is pleasing to the eyes to see so many former Pirate greats receiving opportunities from so many different teams and why shouldnt this be so surprising Despite troubles in the winloss column since the end of the Skip Holtz era select football players have continued to put up stellar numbers while showing the ability to affect a football game drastically enough to garnish looks from NFL scouts PERIOD Despite how glorious the opportunity is for on the fence players to receive that phone call from an NFL team on draft day and post draft day is receiving a bid to attend camp doesnt always hold positive outcomes PERIOD Some players are just not up to par PERIOD

Professional football is a competitive field and coaches do everything in their power to wean out and analyze with scrutiny their late round draft picks and unsigned free agents trimming the fat while still trying to find that hidden gem PERIOD For some these two weeks before the start of week one of the NFL season are filled with joyful embrace and utter feelings of sad disappointment PERIOD So the big question for our favorite ECU football players faced with this highly unstable scenario who makes the cut

Some players are safe and really do not have to sweat a drop as deliberations break down prior to mandatory cut days PERIOD Dez Bryant has a better chance of dropping his . million rookie contract earnings at local Dallas strip clubs this season before Probowl backfield stars such as Chris Johnson and Vontae Leach see minimal playing time on the gridiron this season PERIOD Other emerging stars such as Super Bowl champion defensive linemen CJ Wilson and Linval Joseph dont have too much to worry about either PERIOD Dwayne Harris with the plague of injuries surrounding the Cowboys top wide receivers is prone for an extended workload PERIOD We could see a breakout season from the highly coveted fan favorite PERIOD

Aside from the shooins ECU also has a plethora of athletes who are looking to make the cut and stay on with an NFL team any way they can PERIOD While ECU did not see a player drafted in the  NFL Draft four highly decorated ECU players were able to sign tenders during the undrafted signing period PERIOD Former ECU quarterback Dominique Davis made the Atlanta Falcons 75man roster this week as well as offensive lineman Steven Baker with the Indianapolis Colts PERIOD The Redskins and Browns cut former standouts Lance Lewis and Emmanuel Davis leveling the ECU pedigree in training camps to this date PERIOD Davis has received a lot of snaps under center this preseason and does have a chance to make the final roster behind recent signee Luke McCown PERIOD The future status of Steven Baker remains a mystery as offensive linemen are constantly one blown assignment away from being expendable PERIOD Special team standouts Mike Barbour and Ben Ryan have still continued to receive calls of interests from several NFL teams but nothing final seems eminent PERIOD

Cut weeks are very skeptical can be very political and above all are frightening and terrifying for players like Davis and Baker PERIOD We as Pirates fans will continue to keep a close eye on those players who we cheered our hearts out for every Saturday in the fall hopefully following them to the day they step on an NFL field and be able to say I saw him play at ECU. this writer can be contacted at sportstheeastcarolinian.com PERIOD
