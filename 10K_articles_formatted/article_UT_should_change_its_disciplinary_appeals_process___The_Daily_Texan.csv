5967,2023-07-11,"the framers of the U.S PERIOD Constitution wrote it upon the principles of separation of powers and of checks and balances PERIOD These two legal frameworks prevent the consolidation of power and the confounding of different types of authority PERIOD The UT administrative framework should function in a manner that does the same PERIOD The University president should not have power of adjudication  for both legal and more practical reasons such as public perception PERIOD

Good governance relies on avoiding the allocation of legislative executive and judicial authority to a single entity PERIOD In order to promote fairness and justice these powers should remain separate in both implementation and mode PERIOD The U.S PERIOD president doesnt decide court cases legislators dont command the military and the Supreme Court doesnt write legislation PERIOD By keeping each branchs duties mostly discrete the government keeps itself from abusing power PERIOD

UTs president reserves appellate authority in student proceedings serving as the final say in matters of student disputes that could result in a suspension PERIOD Three problems arise from that method of appeal People question the independence and impartiality of the president distractions arise that detract from other work and the president assumes liability for any decision he or she makes in that capacity PERIOD

Inserting the president at the top of the judicial ladder also defeats the purpose of entrusting authority to those who specialize in student adjudication PERIOD UT has a Title IX coordinator deputy Title IX coordinators investigators and hearing officers who receive training each academic year about offenses investigatory procedures due process requirements conducting a hearing and University policies related to or described in this policy. although a university president may be wellenough equipped to handle Title IX issues and other disciplinary matters usurping the power of officials already active in that capacity does not make legal or financial sense and eats up time the president could spend on a myriad of other issues at a large university PERIOD

The UT president is synonymous with the university embodying our values and accomplishments PERIOD A university president thus personifies a particular school PERIOD It makes sense then to attempt to remove the president from controversy if possible PERIOD Placing the UT president in the midst of Title IX investigations causes those decisions to overshadow much of everything else he or she may accomplish such as the advancement of interdisciplinary collaboration and the furthering of student learning on campus PERIOD We saw this with the accusations that President Gregory Fenves overturned a university Title IX hearing and wrongfully suspended a student PERIOD Furthermore relying on the president to settle claims pits the president against the government in instances where litigation comes about or policy changes are made at the state or federal level PERIOD

UT spokesman J.B PERIOD Bird said in an email that the UTAustin process in place since the early 1970s codifies the fact that the president has executive authority over disciplinary decisions PERIOD Different universities approach the appeals process in different ways but it is almost universal for universities to have some sort of appeals process as part of their overall due process including at some universities presidential appeals. for the sake of public image liability and fairness however UT should change its policy PERIOD We shouldnt let disciplinary proceedings encroach on the good work Fenves does for the UT community PERIOD Consequently the University should entrust disciplinary action wholly to the entities that know it best PERIOD Federal judges dont send their cases to the presidents desk so why should UTs hearing officers send theirs to Fenves

Verses is a Plan II and environmental engineering freshman from San Antonio PERIOD
