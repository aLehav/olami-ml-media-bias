Walking through the corridors of MuddBlaisdell Hall at Pomona College the smell of marijuana can be hard to ignore PERIOD A jaunt through the Pitzer College mounds may result in a sighting of students smoking unidentified substances PERIOD A quick perusal of the Lawry Court balconies on a Saturday night might reveal several groupings of students rolling joints PERIOD

According to the  Annual Campus Safety Reports public reports issued in compliance with federal law for American colleges that contain statistics for alcohol and drug referrals there were a total of  drug referrals in the whole of the Claremont consortium that year with zero of those referrals coming from Keck Graduate Institute Claremont Graduate University or Harvey Mudd College PERIOD There were  referrals from Pomona  from Pitzer six from Scripps College and three from Claremont McKenna College PERIOD

Residence halls and public spaces are monitored by Resident Advisors RAs who have power over reporting policy violations PERIOD But how do RAs who are students themselves foster growth and mutual understanding while simultaneously enforcing policy

According to Pomona RA Wiley Cole PO  Pomonas Office of Campus Life aims to build community in residence halls while still upholding the rules PERIOD

According to Cole one of the most pervasive policy violations is students smoking marijuana behind closed doors in residence halls which often draws complaints from other residents PERIOD

Technically RAs could knock on all the doors but such actions usually prove fruitless in terms of creating a longterm solution to the problem Cole wrote in an email to TSL PERIOD

RAs will often talk to residents in order to persuade the residents to change their behavior PERIOD However Cole warned that if the behavior does not stop we take more drastic measures such as fines and sanctions. knocking on doors usually will not stop policy violations Cole said PERIOD

People know how to hide things that are illegal and how to hide the signs that they have been consuming illegal things Cole said PERIOD Further people can even elect not to open the door unless explicitly ordered by Campus Safety or an RA PERIOD

Austin Henderson PO  said that he believed that RAs should only enforce policy if there is a complaint PERIOD I think the policy is good to exist there for those that dont want to live in a smoking environment but I take the general view of drug policy that no harm should equal no penalty Henderson said PERIOD

Martin Barrera PO  who is also an RA echoed Cole PERIOD In an email to TSL Barrera explained that it is often hard to find the exact source of the smoke PERIOD

Barrera said that he has never encountered issues with drugs other than marijuana and alcohol PERIOD

However as RAs we are aware that encountering harder drugs is a possibility and we are prepared to address these situations if need be he wrote PERIOD

Illegal substances are not addressed uniformly throughout the 5Cs PERIOD Pomona clearly outlines three categories of sanctions Category I addresses marijuana use Category II addresses harder drugs and Category III addresses manufacture or sale of drugs PERIOD Each category has specific sanctions for the first second and sometimes third offense which can include a letter home to the students parents or possible suspension PERIOD

Harvey Mudds drug policy also emphasizes making students aware of state and federal codes regulating substances as well as warning them of possible penalties from the school which are not specified in the policy PERIOD

Scripps addresses drug policy in terms of state and federal statutes but also deals with violations individually PERIOD

Consistency is an important aspect of responding to these situations on a casebycase basis wrote Scripps Dean of Students Rebecca Lee in an email to TSL PERIOD Each situation has its own nuances and it allows us the flexibility to better tailor our response to the situation at hand. lee noted that reports involving drugs are relatively infrequent and almost exclusively involve marijuana PERIOD

The Pitzer student handbook provides students with California policy pertaining to drugs which notably allows for the consumption of marijuana if provided by law PERIOD The handbook also lists pipes hookahs water pipes and any glass or homemade smoking devices as prohibited PERIOD

Claremont McKenna College frames drug policy violations as violations of the colleges Basic Rule of Conduct which involves respect for the community as well as for the colleges academic and administrative processes PERIOD In addition the policy specifically states that CMC complies with federal policy in regard to medical marijuana PERIOD

Even though the 5Cs adhere to state and federal policy in their drug policies the administrations will usually work with Campus Safety before the Claremont Police Department PERIOD

Miriam Feldblum Pomona Dean of Students emphasized that the 5Cs have a good relationship with the Claremont Police Department PERIOD

Campus Safety compiles a report on all unusual activities that occur on campus and are brought to its attention Director of Campus Safety Shahram Ariane wrote in an email PERIOD

Campus Safety explains on its website to provide reports to the campus deans but it does not expand upon how often Campus Safety interacts with local law enforcement PERIOD

Feldblum acknowledged that the Claremont Police Department does not have a presence at the 5Cs and she stressed that the local police only come to the campuses when notified and do not patrol residence halls PERIOD

Feldblum added The college doesnt hesitate to call in local law enforcement in cases such as drug sale or manufacture PERIOD

As Feldblum explained the goal of the college is to make residence halls a place for all students and it is the colleges responsibility to make these living areas safe spaces which could involve drug policy enforcement PERIOD

Cole also highlighted the ultimate goal of safety PERIOD Whether or not a sanction is issued he said the RAs are there to promote safety PERIOD

Safety here means that students are abiding by the Student Code Cole said PERIOD
