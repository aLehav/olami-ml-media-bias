We look at what theyre going to do and their game plan and kind of adjust what were doing Dixon said PERIOD They just happened to focus on Katherine a lot and thats fine PERIOD Teams are going to start to do that because shes good. while Dixons hitting helped the Gophers take one set her blocking had the most impact PERIOD She had a careerhigh  blocks against Penn State  three solo blocks and eight block assists PERIOD

We work on it a lot in practice PERIOD And we just have been working a lot on reading the right things and getting on the right people blockingwise Dixon said PERIOD It just paid off this weekend. minnesota outblocked the Nittany Lions  PERIOD

As a blocking team were making some improvements head coach Hugh McCutcheon said PERIOD I do know we got some good stops PERIOD And certainly against Penn State I thought our blocking team was clean. but McCutcheon said improvements still need to be made in other areas like receiving serves PERIOD

We got aced quite a bit against Penn State and that was one of the big differences in the game McCutcheon said PERIOD

The Gophers had  receiving errors  the same area where the team struggled in its  loss to Penn State earlier this season PERIOD

We definitely struggled a little bit there especially because they have Micha Hancock Dixon said PERIOD Shes a good server and we knew that coming in there. hancock made seven of her teams  aces PERIOD

Minnesotas diverse hitting again played a role in its dramatic win at Ohio State PERIOD

The Gophers dropped the first two sets  and  before coming back to win the next three sets   and  PERIOD

Five Minnesota players recorded nine or more kills while the Buckeyes relied largely on three main hitters PERIOD

I think what I love most about this team is that we go past just one weapon Knudsen said PERIOD Katherine Harms is a great weapon but we have a lot of other good hitters PERIOD So any other night we can go away from her and still be successful. harms led the Gophers on Sunday with  kills followed by Santana with  Dixon with  Knudsen with  and Wittman with nine PERIOD
