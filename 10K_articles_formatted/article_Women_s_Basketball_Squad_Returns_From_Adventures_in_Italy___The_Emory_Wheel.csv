The womens basketball team began preparing for its  season a little differently than it has in the past PERIOD This year the Eagles spent  days traveling through Italy kickstarting practices with an additional bit of culture and giving them a chance to focus on history food and of course basketball PERIOD

It was very different and very exciting sophomore forward Gabi Whitmer said PERIOD We got a cultural experience from it and we also learned a lot about ourselves basketballwise so it was really good coming from both aspects. in October  sophomore guard Hannah Lilly along with two of her senior teammates first approached womens basketball Head Coach Christy Thomaskutty about a team trip overseas PERIOD

While many of the players have had the chance to study abroad or travel prior to this they have never had the opportunity to do so as a team PERIOD

Thomaskutty told those senior players that it was possible but all members had to be on board and they would have to fundraise the money PERIOD

For me it was we can do it but everybody has to be in PERIOD It has to be team thing Thomaskutty said PERIOD

After many fundraising events including a golf tournament and working at various Emory varsity games the players had raised the amount they needed to make their dream trip a possibility PERIOD

We had a team goal and we said we are all going to make this goal Whitmer said of the teams fundraising efforts PERIOD It was stressful getting everything together but it was worth it. and so after a year of preparations their hard work paid off as they gathered at the Atlanta airport on the morning of Aug PERIOD  to fly out to Rome and begin their Italian adventure PERIOD

During the  days they traveled throughout the country and soaked in all that Italy had to offer PERIOD

In addition to Rome the Eagles toured San Gimignano Montecatini Terme Florence Venice San Marco Island Milan Lake Como and Bellagio PERIOD

What we did as far as touring was really remarkable Thomaskutty said PERIOD I mean that was pretty intense and I was really proud of my girls that they just kept trucking on and I think they really enjoyed it. as far as cultural experiences go the members of the team had plenty of those along with their sightseeing PERIOD

From traditional three course meals Venice canal boat rides guided tours in the historic cities and of course lots and lots of gelato the team learned and enjoyed all aspects of Italian life and culture PERIOD

I loved Venice it was my favorite part of the trip Whitmer said PERIOD And the gelato I think everyones favorite part of the trip was the gelato. in addition to their time spent traveling through the various cities visiting Italian landmarks and sampling delicious food there was also some time in the teams jampacked itinerary dedicated to basketball PERIOD

Prior to the trip Thomaskutty held a few practices and scrimmages to get the team ready for play in Italy PERIOD

However with players just returning from summer break and several members of the team treating injuries these were much shorter and less intense than the usual ones during the season PERIOD

While in Italy the Eagles held a few training sessions there as well PERIOD

The players noticed right away how these differed greatly from those at the Woodruff P.E PERIOD Center PERIOD

As Whitmer notes in her blog on Emoryathletics.com the gyms had mosquitoes inside requiring the girls to apply bug spray before practice PERIOD The courts also did not have any air conditioning making it a much less favorable practice facility PERIOD

We take so much for granted here and I think that was the first time some of my players were like wow we are so privileged with everything we have in this country Thomaskutty said PERIOD

In Italy the Eagles played two games against local teams PERIOD They were scheduled to play a third game but the team dropped out PERIOD

Emory played in its first game in Empoli PERIOD

There the Eagles dominated throughout the entirety of the game finishing with a solid  victory PERIOD

In the Eagles second game which took place near Lake Como the team had another strong showing with a  outcome PERIOD

I was really proud in our second game  I thought once we settled down and started playing our game it wasnt about the opponent it was about our goals Thomaskutty said PERIOD It was  at the half and we didnt want them to score as many points in the second half and I thought our defense really picked it up. overall the trip was a tremendous success on multiple levels PERIOD

It gave an already closeknit team a chance to become even closer while touring the historical sites of Italy and honing their basketball skills PERIOD

It was multitiered in that I wanted our kids to play I wanted them to learn I wanted them to have a good time and continue to build their relationships Thomaskutty said PERIOD I thought we got all of those accomplished. by Elizabeth Weinstein
