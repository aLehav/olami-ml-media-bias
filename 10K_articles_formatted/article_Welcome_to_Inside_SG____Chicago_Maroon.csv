2210,2022-03-16,"as someone who spent his first two years at UChicago inside Student Government Im excited to be submitting my first post for my new blogInside SG PERIOD Though I thoroughly enjoyed my time in SG  first as a class rep then as undergraduate liaison to the Board of Trustees  I felt that no matter how much effort SG devoted to communication the student body never grasped what exactly SG does on a daily basis and why or whether SGs work matters PERIOD By blogging about SG developments as they unfold I hope to shrink this knowledge deficit and inform the student body of the ideas successes failures and perspectives of their elected student leaders PERIOD My overarching goal is to encourage an engaged student community that is interested and even participatory in university decisionmaking PERIOD

In this introductory post I have an obligation to set the terms of engagement PERIOD As someone who has devoted a good deal the last two years to SG I cant and dont claim the traditional objectivity expected of a journalist PERIOD While the mission of this blog will always be to report facts my posts wont take the form of the news articles found in the print edition of theMaroon PERIOD Posts will reflect my knowledge of the internal workings of SG report on daily SG business that might not qualify as newsworthy in a printed periodical and occasionally include a glint of opinion more likely in the form of a food for thought observation than direct praise or condemnation PERIOD If I ever feel that I might be too closely connected to a potential scoop to credibly blog about it I will gladly recuse myself and ask a fellowMaroonwriter to follow up on it PERIOD On the whole however I see my experience in SG as an asset not a liability in providing the student body an inside look into the SGs work PERIOD

Well thats enough about me Lets take a look at what things are likeInside SG PERIOD
