2247,2022-03-16,"dont be surprised if you feel a twinge of buyers remorse during your first days on campus PERIOD Theres no turning back now and make no mistake there are a lot of long cold nights ahead to be spent poring over Pascal or typing up gen chem lab reports PERIOD

So if youre having second thoughts already or if Big State U suddenly doesnt sound so bad when youre struggling through Hum reading at  a.m. it helps to be reminded that every so often someone gets out of this place and makes good PERIOD In fact the U of C has been the one of the first stops on the road to riches or renown the actual Aims of Education no matter what the speaker tells you for a long list of people PERIOD Being a Maroon isnt always easy but its nice to know youre in good company PERIOD

For example Billy Cottrell wasnt much of a student in high school but he had a knack for physics and his essay so impressed the U of C admissions office that they decided to let him in PERIOD He arrived here  years ago in the fall of  and finding himself in an environment that appreciated his smarts began to excel academically PERIOD He collected accolades in the math and physics departments and after graduation headed off to Caltech to pursue a Ph.D PERIOD in physics PERIOD

Once he got there Cottrell began a series of smalltime pranks that eventually escalated into a campaign of

ecoterrorism culminating in the destruction by Molotov cocktail of several Hummers at a Los Angeles dealership PERIOD For his efforts the former Maroon received widespread media attention became a cause clbre in environmental circles and was given an eight year prison term PERIOD

Granted Cottrell chose to distinguish himself in an unusual manner and to be fair our physics department has produced far more Nobel Laureates than ecoterrorists12 U of C alumni have won the Nobel Prize in physics including Frank Wilczek A.B PERIOD  one of three recipients in  PERIOD

Besides those   U of C graduates have won Nobel Prizes in other disciplines the most famous among them being economist Milton Friedman A.M PERIOD  who also taught here PERIOD If you count not just graduates but anyone who was ever affiliated with the University the U of C can claim a hand in  Nobel Prizesalthough none of them in the Peace category PERIOD

Of course its no big news that the U of C practically mints pioneering academics PERIOD The Beckers Watsons Fermis and Friedmans have their names and faces on buildings banners and Tshirts all over campus PERIOD But not every U of C grad becomes a towering intellectual so in the interest of balance here are a few alumni that arent trumpeted as loudly PERIOD

First more criminals PERIOD No rundown of U of C lawbreakers would be complete without mentioning Leopold and Loeb two students who famously and brutally murdered a 14yearold boy in  PERIOD Their crime gained great notoriety which only increased when Clarence Darrow arguing for the pair before a judge claimed they only committed the murder because they thought they were Nietzschean supermen PERIOD So U of C

On the other side of the legal system there was Eliot Ness A.B PERIOD  of Untouchables fame the Prohibitionera FBI agent who led the investigation that brought down Al Capones bootlegging operation PERIOD And further up on the law enforcement ladder the U of C has churned out four attorneys general of the United States Ramsey Clark A.M PERIOD  J.D PERIOD  Robert Bork A.B PERIOD  J.D PERIOD  Edward Levi A.B PERIOD  J.D PERIOD  and most recently John Ashcroft J.D PERIOD  PERIOD

Ashcroft isnt the only former Maroon who found a spot in George W PERIOD Bushs administration PERIOD He was joined by Paul Wolfowitz Ph.D PERIOD  formerly the deputy secretary of defense and Tony Snow the Fox Newscommentator and Rush Limbaughguest host turned White House press secretary who was briefly a grad student here PERIOD

That Tony Snow never finished his degree puts him in with another notable but largely unsung group the U of C dropouts PERIOD Among their ranks are author Kurt Vonnegut columnist Roger Ebert actor Ed Asner Oracle CEO Larry Ellison Black media mogul John H PERIOD Johnson and Second City cofounder Mike Nichols PERIOD

Rather than just dropping out Saul Bellow went one step further and transferred to Northwestern PERIOD Even so the U of C claims him as one of its numerous alumni who have gone on to careers in literature and journalism PERIOD Others include David Broder A.B PERIOD  A.M PERIOD  and David Brooks A.B PERIOD  Katharine Graham A.B PERIOD  Susan Sontag A.B PERIOD  Philip Roth A.M PERIOD  and Studs Terkel Ph.B PERIOD  J.D PERIOD  PERIOD

Those guys graduated a long time ago but dont take that to mean the Maroons artistic production has dropped off of late PERIOD More recent classes have included Tucker Max A.B PERIOD  author of I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell Hayden Schlossberger A.B PERIOD  cowriter of Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle and Jason Shaw A.B PERIOD  the videographer behind one of Paris Hiltons home movies PERIOD

Besides dating a multimillionaire heiress socialite Shaw appeared in a WB series several directtoDVD movies and has had a successful career in the male modeling industry PERIOD Yes the U of C is a fine school and there truly are no limits to what a Maroon can achieve once he puts his mind to it PERIOD
