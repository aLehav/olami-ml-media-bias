Even though this might be our first week back on campus as students our universitys mens and womens hockey teams have been busy at work for a few weeks PERIOD Both teams were given a few weeks off for the holidays but the men got right back into action in late December followed shortly thereafter by the womens team in early January PERIOD With all that in mind lets take a look at the past month in review and what could be next for both the mens and womens hockey teams PERIOD

Mens Hockey

The men made their return to the ice in late December for the fifty-sixth Annual Codfish Bowl Tournament in which they were dominant PERIOD They played an exhibition game against the University of Rhode Island club team in which they won  PERIOD They carried that play into a game against Post University in which the Beacons won by a staggering score of  PERIOD

After capping off a successful Codfish Bowl Tournament the Beacons continued to impose their will on their opponents by winning three straight conference matchups while maintaining a plus  goal differential in just those three games PERIOD Since the beginning of January the Beacons hold a  record which brings their conference record to  on the season which is good enough for second place PERIOD

Looking ahead the Beacons still have two weeks remaining in the regular season and three of their final six games will be coming against two of the bottom three teams in the conference PERIOD Those teams are Castleton University and Johnson  Wales University who combine for just two conference wins between the two of them PERIOD If the Beacons can take care of business against those teams they will undoubtedly finish as one of the top teams in the conference PERIOD

Womens Hockey

The women made their return to the ice on Jan PERIOD  when they faced off against Middlebury College but it was far from the return they had hoped for as they lost by a score of  PERIOD However they followed that game up with a big conference victory over Castleton University by a tight margin of  PERIOD In the month of January the Beacons have an overall record of  and a conference record of  so it is safe to say they have been getting the job done against conference opponents recently PERIOD

As it stands the Beacons currently sit in third place in the conference with an overall conference record of  on the season PERIOD Like the mens team the womens hockey teams regular season will be coming to a close in just two weeks PERIOD Six of their last seven games will be coming against teams lower than the Beacons in the conference standings so it will be vital that the Beacons take care of business against those teams if they want to remain one of the top in the conference PERIOD

Going into the final two weeks of the season both the mens and womens hockey teams here at UMass Boston have put themselves in prime position to finish as a top team in each of their respective conferences PERIOD Both the men and women will finish their season playing only teams in their conference so every win will come at a premium going forward PERIOD Both teams will have very winnable games to end the season and only time will tell if they can take advantage PERIOD
