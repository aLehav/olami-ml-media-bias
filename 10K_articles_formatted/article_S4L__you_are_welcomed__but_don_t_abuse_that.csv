9875,2018-11-14,"students for Life S4L you are welcomed on
our campus PERIOD You have every right to express your voice here PERIOD The bias
perpetrated against you recently was an act of injustice and should not have
happened PERIOD However you should know that you have as much responsibility to
avoid attacking the students of this campus as they do for respecting your
right to voice your opinion PERIOD

We love that you are attempting to promote
messages of love on campus but the way youre going about it stands in direct
opposition to that intention PERIOD You set up a table right in front of the main
doors of Gallagher with an intense and triggering display when Gallagher is
supposed to be an inclusive place PERIOD You petitioned to outlaw abortion entirely PERIOD
You may think these actions are for the best but they are harmful messages
that will push people away from you PERIOD

There are people on this campus who have had an
abortion at one point in their lives PERIOD Not just students but faculty and staff
too PERIOD Did you stop to think about that before you put up your display or wrote your slogans on the sidewalk Did
you consider what kind of stigma your display would perpetuate Did you ever
think about who you were hurting If you want to promote a prolife message on
this campus you need to start by approaching it in a way that doesnt attack
people PERIOD Your display attacked people whether you intended it or not PERIOD Its
hypocritical for you to believe in the socalled sanctity of human life and
dignity for all people while disrespecting peoples privacy on such a personal
matter and completely disregarding the potential harm you may have caused PERIOD

Your slogans Love them both Two hearts beat
together both matter and A persons a person no matter how small all
insinuate that people who have had abortions are destroying or devaluing life PERIOD
Yet in doing so you erase the autonomy of people and the power they have to
make choices about their own lives PERIOD You may not have meant that when you wrote
your slogans but thats how they came across PERIOD

While we understand your frustration at having
your chalk messages erased the way youve responded has been far from
appropriate PERIOD Specifically your national organizations blog post about the
incident was inaccurate and irresponsible PERIOD To label the actions of a few
students as the actions of a mob and to claim that these students perpetrated
violence against people in the S4L group is a grossly inept
misrepresentation of what actually happened PERIOD Your voice was not silenced PERIOD There
is no need for insipid apologies and sententious statements PERIOD What we call for
is an end to the hyperbolic narratives you have created and the climate of
false fear you continue to instill in our student body PERIOD

No they should not have erased your chalk
messages but they did not perpetrate violence PERIOD No one was physically harmed PERIOD
No ones property or belongings were destroyed PERIOD They poured water on your
messages to erase them PERIOD It shouldnt have happened but it was not violent and
for the national organization to label our student base as a violent mob is
atrocious PERIOD The claim that these people were motivated by prochoice politicians
who incite violence is completely unfounded PERIOD Not only is there no evidence
that their actions were inspired by Eric Holders comments last month but
those comments were not an incitement of violence to begin with PERIOD His message 
when they go low we kick them  was entirely metaphorical PERIOD He himself even
explained this moments after making the comment PERIOD

Holder said When I say we you know We kick
em I dont mean we do anything inappropriate PERIOD We dont do anything illegal PERIOD
But weve got to be tough and we have to fight for the very things that civil
rights leaders John Lewis Martin Luther King Whitney Young  you know all
those folks gave to us. whats even more outrageous is that you
attempted to misrepresent this comment to fit a prochoice versus prolife
debate PERIOD This comment had nothing to do with that specific debate PERIOD Rather
Holder was talking about how the Democratic Party needs to adopt tougher
tactics when dealing with Republicans PERIOD He was not inciting violence or telling
people on the left to attack prolife people PERIOD You must stop obscuring the truth
to fit your own narratives PERIOD We will not listen to your fabricated versions of
reality PERIOD

For a group so dead set on revealing the
truth about abortions you seem willing to lie if it means perpetuating the
false narrative that prolife groups face any more unjust discrimination than
prochoice groups do or that conservative voices are being silenced in this
politically correct society PERIOD You silence others voices and when they try to
speak up you call yourself a victim PERIOD At least you can put a display up PERIOD At
least you can fundraise PERIOD You have your voice and people to support it PERIOD When are
prochoice groups on our campus going to get that

If you want to prevent abortion  if thats your true goal  then there are ways to go about it that dont attack people in the way your slogans and your display did PERIOD Your goal to provide pregnancy resources for expecting mothers is absolutely ontrack and youll find that many prochoice people support exactly that method of prevention PERIOD Prochoice people dont want abortion any more than prolife people do PERIOD We should all agree that education on safesex practices and pregnancy resources is the way to reduce abortions PERIOD Lets stick to that instead of attacking and traumatizing students that have gone through a difficult and painful experience PERIOD We will not entertain voices that justify denying others rights because of tradition or complacency PERIOD We will not entertain voices that refuse to acclimate themselves to the changing world to the choices and rights of others and to the wellbeing of the nation we share PERIOD
