1761,2023-10-30,"pioneer Village 1630is a recreation of the way the earliest English settlement may have looked in Salem MA PERIOD Unfortunately for manyreasons includinglack of support from various stakeholders in Salem the village has frequently been unavailable to the public PERIOD

In Salem the month of October can be wild PERIOD Were not talking accusing girls wild PERIOD Were talking tourist season wild PERIOD

Tourism is an essential part of the economy of many towns and cities in America PERIOD But what is the price of this exchange In a place like Salem the price is truth PERIOD Or at least history PERIOD

In  a number of girls in Salem Village began to accuse their neighbors of witchcraft PERIOD You might have heard the story PERIOD Many years later Salem became synonymous with its nickname The Witch City. residents of the area which includes Salem Beverly Danvers Peabody and Lynn know beyond the shadow of a doubt what is the busiest time of the year PERIOD Is it the picturesque summer season No PERIOD The glorious fall season Not in its entirety PERIOD It is the weeks leading up to Halloweenabsolutely and unquestionably PERIOD

By contrast in the first few centuries after  the witchcraft trials were not looked upon kindly PERIOD Given that the trials resulted in the deaths of  members of the Salem community this is unsurprising PERIOD The trials ripped apart a community that had already been besieged by a fundamental part of pioneer life fear PERIOD Fear of discontinued support from England officially renewed just before the trials and fear of Native American attacks to name a few PERIOD

In the years following  Salem Village even changed its name PERIOD We know it now as Danvers PERIOD Todays Salem is actually old Salem Town PERIOD It was not the focal point of the trials PERIOD Do Danvers residents feel like theyre missing out on the revenue the Witch City brings in I doubt it PERIOD

And yet the motivation to embrace its current identity was powerful at one point PERIOD In the mid20th century Salem like some other American cities was struggling economically PERIOD It was around this time the kitschy witch economy emerged PERIOD

Today the tourist activity around Salem immobilizes traffic for miles around its downtown PERIOD For a month locals give up on street parking entirely PERIOD Community groups churches and interested locals fret over the darker pall that can hang over some events PERIOD Because even in todays times its not all kitsch PERIOD

While Wicca and other groups that purportedly practice real witchcraft have some latitude in Salem it is not these groups that have the most grounds for concern PERIOD Instead in an era of greater intolerance ignorance and fear of strangers is has become increasingly dangerous to make fun of something that was once historically dead serious. in  on the three hundredth anniversary of the Salem Witch Trials Elie Wiesel was invited to speak at a ceremony that dedicated a new memorial to the victims of the trials PERIOD Wiesel is the author of the book Night which details his experiences in Nazi Germanys concentration camps during World War II PERIOD When he was invited to give the speech Wiesel asked himself Why me

Although there were many reasons to consider Wiesel a Nobel Peace Prize winner for the speech I imagine city officials recognized that Wiesel himself had been a victim once PERIOD And while it was not asked of him and though it appears he himself did not see it this way I imagine its possible he spoke that day for the victims whose voices were silenced  years ago PERIOD

In his speech Wiesel repeated the message that had won him the Nobel Prize intolerance is intolerable PERIOD Differences are real but they are not grounds for killing each other PERIOD Fear whipped up into frenzied hysteria always has terrible consequences PERIOD

So this Halloween go to Salem PERIOD But when you do go to the Salem Witch Trial memorial PERIOD Think about which side of history you want to be on PERIOD

An actor plays Bridget Bishop a woman accused and hung for witchcraft in the ongoing production of a historical and interactive play happening in downtown Salem daily throughOct PERIOD  PERIOD
