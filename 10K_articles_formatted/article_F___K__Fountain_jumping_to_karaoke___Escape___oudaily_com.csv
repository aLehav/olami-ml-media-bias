If you enjoy hitting the pavement in a new

pair of running shoes consider yourself a

do you get to admire the stadium as you

wade through the water but if you get an

itch to burn some calories you can swim a

few laps PERIOD

and the Visitor Center

Made up of one rock from each county

in Oklahoma this fountain is as natural

as it comes PERIOD No need to worry about it

not being organic you cant get more

organic than a rock PERIOD The scenery around

you will appeal to your personality as

well consisting of greenery and lots of

shade provided by the many large trees

surrounding the area PERIOD This fountain is also

one of the deepest on campus PERIOD

Personality Type The Outgoing One

Fountain South Oval

Location I think you can figure this out PERIOD

You are the person walking around

campus in the lime green shirt and the

and admiring you at all times PERIOD Grab a

beach towel and your soobnoxiousitscute

bathing suit and make a splash in the

fountain in the center of the South Oval PERIOD I

suggest around  p.m PERIOD Believe me you

will have a crowd PERIOD

G  Greek traditions

Sooner Scandals is one of the

longest running traditions on

campus PERIOD Although it is not open

only for members of the greek

community the sororities and

Take a step off the beaten path and check out these

yummy Norman gems PERIOD

Old Town Gyros on Porter Avenue offers authentic and fresh Mediterranean food PERIOD They even

make their own Tzatiziki sauce a tangy cucumber dip from scratch PERIOD Most places cheat and use

store bought yogurt PERIOD Customers flock to their gyros and kabobs but Old Town likes to add a lot

of variety to the menu with the ghormeh sabzi a steamy beef stew with basmati rice PERIOD

Its small and hidden location gives you a mix of customers from students to locals on the

their lunch break PERIOD I always leave stuffed said English junior Taylor Milligan PERIOD

student PERIOD Best General Tsos chicken

Ive ever had PERIOD Go there. take note of the lunch buffet PERIOD

Its best for those of us who are poor

college kids. just so you know service

is slow but just think of it as delayed

gratification or something PERIOD

Top it all off with one of their cream

based Thai teas and youll be hooked PERIOD

Taste of India on twelfth Street is an exotic treat PERIOD If you dont have the stomach for spicy food

dont worry PERIOD There are mild curries and sauces PERIOD Try the Chicken Saagwala if you cant take the

heat PERIOD However for those who like it hot try the Chicken Vindaloo PERIOD

I was terrified because I dont like spicy food and I dont stray too far from American

cuisine PERIOD But I really liked the Naan PERIOD Its like an Indian Quesadilla said psychology junior

Hailey Wilson PERIOD

The price range is a little high  around  a plate PERIOD

I  Interfraternity council IFC

OUs IFC wouldnt run as

smoothly if it werent for its

executive committee tasked

to try to make IFC more

relevant on campus and to

more aspects other than
