Connie Morris played at both Utah and Salt Lake Community College before joining the Rainbow Wahine PERIOD

At the end of last season Rainbow Wahine basketball head coach Laura Beeman promised that there would be more size on the upcoming edition of the team PERIOD Beeman has delivered on that promise with one player in particular who stands headandshoulders above her peers PERIOD

We want her on the blocks and getting her the ball inside PERIOD Teams are either going to have to double her or theyre going to have to play her oneonone PERIOD She is going to open up our offense and free up players like Shawna Kuehu and Destiny King and Ashleigh Karaitiana to hit shots or for them to slash to the basket PERIOD She is going to make other teams guard her and thats a great thing head coach Laura Beeman said PERIOD

Junior center Connie Morris towers over most of her teammates played well in exhibition games so far this season PERIOD

REPLACING A LEGEND

Last season marked the end of the illustrious career of power forward Kamilah Jackson PERIOD For four seasons Jackson supplied the Bows with a steady stream of interior scoring and rebounding and departed the University of Hawaii as the fourth alltime leading scorer and second alltime leader in career rebounds PERIOD Jackson averaged . points and . rebounds per game during her tenure at UH and was the second player ever to join the 1000point rebound club for the Rainbow Wahine PERIOD

Coming into this season the team knew it would have to find a new dominant force to anchor them from the post and seems to have found one in Morris PERIOD

Its gonna be a big difference Beeman said PERIOD Connie is a legit 6foot4 PERIOD Connie doesnt have the same guard skills that Mia Jackson had yet though she can develop them. additionally Beeman believes that Morris can continue to bring her game to new heights PERIOD

I think what makes it most encouraging is that I dont think Connie is close to her potential Beeman said PERIOD I think she still plays a little passive and is kinda waiting and seeing PERIOD She sometimes looks at it as Shawna and Ashleigh and Destinys team PERIOD We need to get her more aggressive PERIOD But I dont look at that as a negative PERIOD I think its great how much talent and upside she has. still that type of pressure placed on her by her coach is exactly the reason why Morris chose Hawaii PERIOD

She wants us working hard Morris said PERIOD Its not just on the guards to get the ball to us post players PERIOD She works us to make sure we work for good position PERIOD The other schools I looked at didnt have that kinda emphasis on getting it to the post players PERIOD It was more of get the ball to them once in a while PERIOD Only Coach Beeman really showed that emphasis. in fact Morris had an interesting tale on what truly sold her on Hawaii PERIOD

I came to a game against Fullerton and they actually got their butts kicked Morris said PERIOD But watching her coach she knew that her team was going to learn from that experience PERIOD She wasnt just screaming at her players PERIOD She told them what they did wrong and what they needed to work on PERIOD But also watching them you could tell that team had a lot of chemistry PERIOD Even when they were down they kept fighting PERIOD I knew she would make her players better. gROWING UP IN THE GAME

Growing up there was always competition going on between Morris and her family PERIOD

Morris mother Bernice played basketball and volleyball at Utah Valley State College PERIOD Morris older brother Anthony had a delayed start to college due to a mission trip and is currently a sophomore on the Dixie State basketball team PERIOD

Me and my brother would go at each other all the time Morris said PERIOD It got to a point where we were like Do we even like each other anymore He came back from his mission and he wanted to get back into sports PERIOD So we would play and he was old and fat so I finally got to kick his butt PERIOD It felt great PERIOD But yeah we are always very competitive PERIOD Even in something like minigolf well still be trying to beat each other. morris is also one of those players who have been immersed in the game of basketball for her entire life PERIOD In addition to her family members playing her grandfather coached her and introduced her to the game at a very young age PERIOD

I was raised by a single mom and my grandfather was a basketball coach Morris said PERIOD So when I was a kid even before I was in like elementary school I was going down to those practices with my grandpa and seeing what basketball was PERIOD Those guys were like giants to me even though were kinda the same size now PERIOD So I really have grown up with basketball PERIOD Ive been around it my whole life. lOOKING AHEAD

There is no doubt a challenging road lies ahead of the Rainbow Wahine and Morris PERIOD But Morris is looking forward to being for all intents and purposes at the center of it PERIOD

Going from high school into my freshman season was a huge jump Morris said PERIOD Like it was a mindblowing kind of experience PERIOD But getting that experience and then getting some development at junior college was good for me because now I can come in and understand what it is that were running here and what I have to do. morris realizes the expectations on her shoulders to step in and replace Jackson on the court and firmly believes that the task can be done although it may require a team effort to do so PERIOD

I dont know if alone I can replace her Morris said PERIOD Im going to be me and bring what I can do to this team PERIOD I feel I have a good basketball IQ and I guess I could replace her PERIOD But I know its not going to be just me PERIOD We have Dalayna Sampson who is a beast on the boards PERIOD So as a whole I definitely think we can come in and take that spot and be that beast for the team. beemans Vote of Confidence

I think shell make a difference Beeman said PERIOD Obviously we have to make sure she stays out of foul trouble but we will tell her to always be aggressive PERIOD We will face teams that have post players who are  or  and were going to have to doubleteam because theyre skilled PERIOD But she gives us that immediate size PERIOD We know that she can go oneonone with these people and that she wont be dominated because of the size PERIOD It makes our defensive schemes a little easier because she is that deterrent. i really have grown up with basketball PERIOD Ive been around it my whole life PERIOD
