I can now accurately describe what makes up a Poo Cocktail Supreme bungee cords and a PortaPotty PERIOD

I also saw a visual representation of the phrase  learned that it is socially unacceptable to hook up with ones granddaughter in public and that it takes about one hundred bee stings to kill a man PERIOD

These are some of the many joys of watching 

After ten years of  you might think the crew Johnny Knoxville SteveO Bam Margera Ryan Dunn Dave England Wee Man Preston and others would have run out of ideas or become crippled due to severe injury. however theyre all still going harder than ever with even more vomitinducing awesome stunts PERIOD

Each  movie creates a rare atmosphere in theaters. it is not only tolerated but encouraged for audience members to curse yell and make comments at the screen PERIOD

 opened on Oct PERIOD  at the Metropolitan Museum of Art which says a lot more about cultural acceptance of  than the crew changing. parents heavily criticized the show during its first season in the early 2000s prompting MTV to restrict showing  until later at night PERIOD

The public attitude toward the show and the films has changed and the stunts have gotten crazier. maybe its a part of the  phenomenon where a series criticized for being obscene becomes heralded as satirical counter culture PERIOD

Some have called the  crew the evolution of some of the twentieth centurys slapstick legends Charlie Chaplin and The Three Stooges PERIOD

If  is evolution then its also a wonderful mutation. i have serious doubts that there are any clips of The Three Stooges using their penises to bat golf balls or sticking an apple up a fat mans ass for a pig to grab PERIOD

After getting over the shock of seeing the crew go through an obstacle course of tasers and cattle prods the most interesting part of  might be the structure of each stunt PERIOD

The crew spends equal time describing the set up performing the stunt and then rolling on the floor laughing or screaming in pain. this brings the audience into the film in an unusual way making us feel like were hanging out with the guys without the high risk of getting a concussion. random celebrity appearances Tony Hawk Jared Allen Sean William Scott and others just add to the bizarreness of the movie constantly having viewers ask  Everybody wants to be friends with Johnny Knoxville PERIOD

This movie will make you nauseous and question the sanity of everyone involved with  But its a beautiful thing PERIOD
