Collegians editorial opinion is determined by its Board of Opinion with the editor holding final responsibility PERIOD

Last Wednesday Sen PERIOD Christopher Dodd RConn. introduced an amendment to the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of  PERIOD The amendment aims to end lawmakers ability to accept free refreshments and meals from registered lobbyists PERIOD

Included in the bill are provisions intended to improve congressional ethics such as requirements to disclose earmarks and payments made before any bill amendment or report can be presented to the Senate ending the receipt of gifts from lobbyists and increasing the length of time a former lawmaker must wait to lobby his or her former colleagues PERIOD

One of the good and for the politically inclined interesting aspects of this amendment is its sponsorship PERIOD In addition to Dodd introducing it Senators Rick Santorum RPa. barack Obama DIll. john McCain RAriz. and Joseph Lieberman DConn. announced their support making this amendment a prominent bipartisan effort by popular and widely known senators PERIOD

But aside from this new and perhaps increasing occurrence of bipartisanship this amendment  and perhaps the bill in its entirety  is befuddling PERIOD

Though it is admittedly probably a good thing that the Senate finally decided to tackle this issue it is  so why is ethics a seemingly new issue

Congress needs to deal with the relationship between lobbyists and lawmakers PERIOD But to what extent will this really affect any of the politics that goes on between interest groups lobbyists lawmakers voters the administration foreign governments etc. how will Congress manage to regulate any of it

Is this initiative a nice bipartisan effort to get reelected Maybe a little nudge to the voters just to show off that the Senate can work together and wants to prove its moral rectitude to the people If so nice work senators because it will probably work PERIOD Ethical issues like  are vital in Americans voting habits PERIOD

Hopefully in addition to getting votes the senators who sponsored the bill along with other members of Congress will consider what the legislation really means and start to practice it PERIOD
