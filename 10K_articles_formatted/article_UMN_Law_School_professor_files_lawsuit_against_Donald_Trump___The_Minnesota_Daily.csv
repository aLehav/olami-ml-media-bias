Professor Richard Painter answers questions in an interview at Mondale hall on West Bank on Tuesday Feb PERIOD   PERIOD Painter sits as vicechair for the lawsuit against President Trump for allegedly violating the emoluments clause of the constitution PERIOD

by  Bella DallySteelePublished  February  

A University of Minnesota law professor is working with a watchdog organization to sue President Donald Trump for major ethics violations PERIOD

The group  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  filed its lawsuit against Trump Jan PERIOD  claiming his refusal to sell his businesses creates conflicts of interest and violates the Constitutions foreign emoluments clause PERIOD Richard Painter a University professor and former chief ethics lawyer to President George W PERIOD Bush is one of the lawyers on the case PERIOD

Painters legal expertise and sense of priority paired with a unique sense of humor make him a valuable asset to the team said Norman Eisen who is also listed on the lawsuit and was chief ethics lawyer to President Barack Obama PERIOD

Claire Hill a fellow law professor who has written papers with Painter said his ability to use knowledge of the subjects he teaches and publishes on  namely ethics and professional responsibility  will help him in the case PERIOD

Painter said he was disappointed when while declaring their candidacies neither Trump nor Sen PERIOD Hillary Clinton promised to sever ties with their businesses and foundations should they become president PERIOD

I think Clinton should have promised to do so and I think she should have said Hey Donald you better do the same thing he said PERIOD Of course the conflicts created by Trumps businesses are a lot worse than the conflicts created by a charitable foundation. painter said he hopes the court will uncover what payments Trump and his organizations receive from foreign governments interpret the Constitution and tell Trump what he can keep PERIOD

I hope Trump comes out of this and I hope he rethinks what I think is a very stubborn position that hes been taking he said PERIOD

The last time a president held such substantial conflicts of business interest Painter said was George Washington and Thomas Jeffersons ownership of slaves PERIOD

But since then I have not seen business holdings of the president of such a magnitude have such an extreme impact on the country he said PERIOD

In addition to conflicts of interest Painter said Trumps immigration ban raises ethical qualms due to religious discrimination and its selective application to Muslimmajority countries PERIOD

You have First Amendment  Fifth Amendment and due process all folded in with the  financial conflicts of interest  its not a good situation he said PERIOD

Painter also takes issue with Trumps refusal to release his tax returns and said he supports the bill introduced to the Minnesota state legislature that would require candidates to release their tax return records before gaining a spot on the ballot PERIOD

Painter said hes remained optimistic about the present lawsuit PERIOD

This lawsuit is only one of many ways in which the presidents decision to continue to take these foreign government payments is going to be challenged he said PERIOD Its going to be challenged by Congress PERIOD And at some point the Republicans as well as the Democrats are going to get fed up and theyre going to demand answers and if Congress demands answers they better get them. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
