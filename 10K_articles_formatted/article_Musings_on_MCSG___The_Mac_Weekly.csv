Open Letter to former Macalester President Brian Rosenberg

In most respects I am not a particularly driven or motivated person at least when it comes to school and its related activities PERIOD Getting my homework done often produces profound anxiety and Id really rather complain about a Kagin dance than plan or attend one myself PERIOD And yet the stars must have had something else in store this semester when I found myself diving headfirst into CineSonic a fairly largescale installation project in partnership with MIX NYC a nonprofit organization dedicated to queer experimental film.Firstly lets be real I have spent the last couple of weeks cursing the stars above me every day for making me feel like I could actually do something that could be new and different for Macalester PERIOD I was deeply upset with myself for having the audacity to believe that my ideas had any sort of value inherent to them or that these ideas were at all worthy of capital through the institution PERIOD Its queer its political its art and seeing as Ive declared a fatwa against mocktails it probably has no place on our campus PERIOD At the very least thats the message it felt like I kept getting while working through MCSG to get funding PERIOD

Okay thats not entirely fair PERIOD I encountered some really amazing and vocal supporters who were in attendance at MCSG meetings when my additional allocation through Queer Union and KAADATT was being heard PERIOD People Id never met before were really excited about the prospect of something new and some of the critiques levied in my opposition were more than fair it is indeed an expensive event and there are indeed several other things happening on that night April  pick mine trollops PERIOD I felt like I was almost learning something while attending these meetings that maybe some people who are interested in the governmental process arent necessarily completely irreconcilably evil you know in the way that people who listen to Coldplay maybe just dont know that there are alternatives PERIOD And then as all of my requested funding was denied despite the acknowledged impeccable organization of an event quite unlike any other events happening on campus with a group of professional working artists who have ties to Macalester that go back to our heyday in the nineties I remembered oh yeah PERIOD The government is fucking evil and at the end of the day its no skin off their ass so long as no one calls them out on their routinely oppressive bullshit throughout the allocation process PERIOD

CineSonic was called hedonistic I was asked in private during the meeting if any of my budget was set aside for drugs short answer no you presumptuous boob none of my budget is for drugs and the events cost was criticized by individuals on MCSG who were actively in the process of submitting their own events with similar price tags PERIOD I found this meeting to be fundamentally disempowering and left feeling judged based on some peoples perception of my identity and my politic PERIOD And again if I wanted to be called out for being a lesbian and told that my ideas were frivolous I would have stayed in high school PERIOD All of this functioned to affirm for me that MCSG as an organization although comprised of my fellow students is sure as shit not a group of my peers PERIOD

After all of this at Tuesdays meeting MCSG decided to overturn their previous decision and granted me  on appeal an additional  was received through the Lavender fund on campus which exists for queerrelated events and activities on campus PERIOD This happened when I showed up with a large group of supporters and directly spelled out my above issues PERIOD And really this Tuesdays meeting was an entirely different experience from the week before everyone seemed to be bending over backwards to make sure that I knew how happy they were that I had come back to appeal the decision that they were all hoping for the best for its approval PERIOD And dont get me wrong I really appreciated it PERIOD It just made me sad to realize that my feelings and the feelings of countless other people involved with countless other organizations are simply not considered by student government until the issue becomes personal and until they are personally implicated as homophobic or racist or sexist or any or all of the above PERIOD

I suppose the heart of my argument here is that MCSG as an organization doesnt seem to recognize its own gatekeeping tactics with regards to events that they think are lame i.e PERIOD based around identity politics or special interests PERIOD This fosters an environment where the popular kids rule and everyone else has to beg for the chance to do something that they feel is important or valuable for the greater campus community which by the way is not homogeneous and should not be dominated by any single majoritarian social identification PERIOD And while I extend my deepest gratitude for the ability to make CineSonic happen it is still only one event and therefore the exception to a governmental policy that caters almost exclusively to its own divine interest PERIOD
