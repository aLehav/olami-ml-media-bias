2849,2005-02-16,"university of Wisconsin students stopped on their way to class Tuesday to sign doors in protest of tuition increases as part of a rally organized by the United Council of UW Students PERIOD

UCUW completed a 15day UW Systemwide tour at Library Mall after having door signings at  of the  universities within the system PERIOD

Organizing and Communications Director Brian Tanner was at Tuesdays signing and said the doors were meant to signify the closeddoor policy of Wisconsin legislature regarding tuition increases PERIOD He said these increases are excluding lowerincome families from attending UW System schools PERIOD

For us the doors illustrate that when Wisconsin representatives close the door on legislature they are closing doors on lowincome students or students from workingclass families from attending UW campuses Tanner said PERIOD

Tanner added people need to be aware that outofstate students are also affected by tuition increases PERIOD

UW sophomore Anna Schroeder is from out of state and said although her parents pay for her tuition she still thought the door signing was a good idea PERIOD

Tuition hikes suck PERIOD Im from out of state so my tuitions already high Schroeder said PERIOD The doors are a good idea  students need to voice their opinion more especially about tuition. upon completion of their tour UCUW collected a total of  doors one from each UW university PERIOD The doors are signed front to back with signatures from students concerned with tuition increases PERIOD

During a UCUW rally scheduled for Feb PERIOD  the doors will be handdelivered to offices at the State Capitol as a representation of student awareness PERIOD

The rhetoric at the Capitol is that students are not vocal Tanner said PERIOD We have to change the conception that students are not vocal. at the door signing UCUW handed out flyers asking students to take action PERIOD Printed on the back of the flyers were phone numbers of state representatives along with a script for students to follow citing a  percent tax increase in tuition from last year and a  increase in the last two years PERIOD

I dont like tuition increases  I dont like them at all UW senior and Wisconsin native Abigail Darlow said PERIOD My loans dont cover full cost tuition because my loan was a capped rate PERIOD I have to pay the increases out of my pocket. darlow added she is working full time and is only taking eight credits because of financial constraints PERIOD

UW freshman Max Robbins said he believes tuition increases defeat the idea of a public university PERIOD

I feel its unnecessary to increase tuition especially at a public university Robbins said PERIOD The idea of a public university is to make education affordable and available to anyone interested in higher learning. although many students stopped to add their signature in protest of tuition increases Tanner said students still do not realize there is a long way to go and that the doors are just the first step in a long process PERIOD

Madison is the flagship institution of the UW System he said PERIOD For anything to take effect Madison students need to step up and be vocal. this article was published Feb   at  am and last
