When you go to college in Boston its pretty likely you will end up at a Boston sports game one way or another PERIOD  And if youre lucky one might be a Red Sox game PERIOD

Everyone wants to see Fenway Park PERIOD Many members of Red Sox Nation want nothing more than to watch the game from on top of the Green Monster and eat a Fenway Frank PERIOD Many say the Sox are an important aspect of Boston culture and attending a game is something that some college students say is a must while you live in the city PERIOD

Something is always happening at a Sox game said Jessica Rousselle a recent graduate of Boston University PERIOD My favorite part of going to a game is singing Sweet Caroline  I love that almost everyone in the park sings along PERIOD Going to a game is definitely something everyone needs to experience. some college students love attending games but dont always know how to get tickets PERIOD

Ive lived in Massachusetts all of my life and Ive never been to a game said Christina Simmirano a senior psychology major at Northeastern PERIOD I would go to a game if I could get tickets but I dont know where to get them. getting tickets to a game can be challenging for some students though informed fans know its possible to find tickets from a variety of places PERIOD

I look for them anywhere I can get them said Rousselle who added that she loves baseball and has been a diehard Red Sox fan for as long as she can remember PERIOD

I usually get my tickets from stubhub.com but I recently got a gift certificate from Ace Tickets she said PERIOD Stub Hub has always worked for me. stub Hub is a website that allows people to buy and sell tickets to sporting events as well as concerts and performing arts events PERIOD Ace Ticket is a company that resells tickets while Stub Hub is a website where people create an account to buy and sell tickets online PERIOD

Tickets arent cheap or easy to find said Elise Droste a middler international affairs and political science major at Northeastern PERIOD My mom uses Ace Tickets PERIOD When I was younger my dad used to take me to Red Sox games all the time. while some students purchase tickets on their own others rely on friends and family PERIOD

The only time Ive ever gone to a Red Sox game has been with my parents said Annalisa Amicangelo a recent graduate of Boston University PERIOD I wouldnt be able to afford the tickets otherwise. for fans with lastminute plans its possible to get tickets the day of a game PERIOD

I also know that if you go a few hours before the game and you go to a special gate you can get unused tickets at face value from the Red Sox Droste said PERIOD

According to the Red Sox website a small amount of game day tickets go on sale for face value at Gate E on Lansdowne Street two hours before the game PERIOD Fans can start to line up five hours before a game PERIOD If you manage to get tickets you have to enter the park immediately PERIOD

Thrifty fans may also be able to find a deal on the streets from ticket scalpers PERIOD The scalpers often ask if anyone is selling tickets  its illegal for them to sell the tickets so they act like theyre looking to buy them instead  so keep an eye out for that PERIOD Fans may get lucky and score a deal but its more likely theyll wind up paying a lot especially if youre trying to get into a major ballgame like when the Yankees are in town PERIOD
