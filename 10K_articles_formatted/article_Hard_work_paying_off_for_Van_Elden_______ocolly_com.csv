Moving halfway across the world to play tennis and go to school in a place you had only seen on television would be a scary thing to a lot of people but not Oklahoma State junior Mark Van Elden PERIOD



 Van Elden said PERIOD 



Van Elden   Big  was born in Australia but played for a year at Auburn before coming to OSU PERIOD



Moving across the world forces you to grow up fast Van Elden said PERIOD



 Van Elden said PERIOD But I feel like it was worth it and I feel like Ive gotten better everyday since Ive been here.The main thing that Ive improved is the more mental side of the gameYou know not getting upset when youre playing in front of crowds away from home its things like that that can really cause a player to lose his composure PERIOD Thats something that Ive had to work on to get better PERIOD I feel like Ive made some tremendous improvements in that area.Last year I had a good seasonBut I was new to Oklahoma State and there were a couple of big matches early on where I didnt play very well PERIOD







One of the big reasons why Van Elden chose to come to OSU he said was because of coach James Wadley PERIOD Van Elden said he likes the way Wadley handles the players and that the coach has made him a better player PERIOD



 Van Elden said PERIOD There is no doubt in my mind that he Wadley has made me a better player both physically and mentally.I just got to stay focused and win all my matches from here on outI put all the hard work in last year and now Ive just got to keep playing hard for the rest of the year and Ill be all right PERIOD
