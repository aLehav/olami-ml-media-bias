5484,2022-03-16,"the Occidental mens water polo team  overall  SCIAC fell  to PomonaPitzer Saturday in the first home competition of the year at Taylor Pool PERIOD

The matchup started conference play for the Tigers who had come off a series of tough games and tournaments against numerous ranked teams from across the country PERIOD

Their competitive season began in early September in Providence Rhode Island at Brown Universitys Bruno Classic where the Tigers faced stiff competition from teams such as Brown and MIT PERIOD The following week they took on Southern California NAIA Division II and SCIAC teams at the Inland Empire Tournament at La Verne PERIOD The Tigers earned their first victories of the season in early October against Penn StateBehrend and Caltech at the Gary Troyer Memorial Tournament in Claremont PERIOD



We kind of got our sea legs so that going into SCIAC play we can have our identity as a team and use that to our advantage Matt Weiser sophomore said PERIOD Those are the programs that have success PERIOD It is like a model of where we want to be. the Sagehens led off Saturdays home opener with an aggressive push tallying a quick three points in the first four minutes of the game PERIOD With a little more than a minute to go in the first quarter Paul Bergevin junior put the Tigers on the board with a power shot through the arms of the PomonaPitzer goalie Daniel Diemer PERIOD An additional Sagehen goal in the waning seconds of the first quarter brought the score to  PERIOD

After the quarter break the Tigers returned to hold the Sagehens to two points in the second quarter PERIOD Topher Lacramps firstyear found the cage in the middle of the second rounding out a quick first half that found the Occidental men behind PomonaPitzer  PERIOD

A series of rapidfire Sagehen goals in the beginning of the third spurred the Tiger defense followed by a doublereply from Bergevin and Dominic Rodriquez sophomore PERIOD  Goalie Josh Needleman senior thrilled the homecoming crowd with several formidable blocks keeping the Sagehens to three in the third quarter PERIOD

Several overthrown passes a series of PomonaPitzer steals and a couple of closebutnocigar shots plagued the Tigers in the fourth however and the Sagehens rounded out the second half with another three goals carrying the tally to  for the game PERIOD

I thought we had some really good moments where we got some shots off that we needed to get head coach Chris Lee said PERIOD Our offense was working the way I envisioned we just needed to sharpen things up a little bit. for much of the game the Tiger offense was strong pressing hard into PomonaPitzer territory to get shots off PERIOD

A lot of what we have done has been about getting people on the same page Lee said PERIOD There are a lot of opportunities in a game like this to be able to run plays PERIOD I think our guys are paying attention to what we are working on and we are doing things right. needleman agreed noting that the team should work on pressure passing and defense going into the rest of SCIAC play PERIOD

I think that this pool is an equalizer and we just need to learn how to play in it. needleman said PERIOD We dont have enough players to scrimmage in this pool six on six so when we play a game we are not used to that kind of environment PERIOD Practice is very different from what a game is like. taylor Pool built in  is the oldest pool in use for SCIAC competition and one of the oldest pools in the country still used competitively in the NCAA PERIOD Whereas other pools have more than six lanes that allow games to be played entirely in deep water games in Taylor pool are played from the shallow end to deep end PERIOD Additionally the outofbounds lines are the high gutters that surround Taylor Pool whereas in other SCIAC pools the boundaries are lane lines PERIOD

Looking forward to todays game against Whittier Needleman remained positive PERIOD

Whittier graduated a lot of their players but they maintain a strong roster he said PERIOD I expect it to be a hard game but it will not be impossible

The Tigers take on the Whittier Poets tonight at  p.m PERIOD at Taylor Pool PERIOD
