The Erie community offers many ways for aspiring performers to get involved from the Gannon University Schuster Theatre to the Erie Playhouse to independent companies as well PERIOD

In fact there is generally a lot of crossover between the stages PERIOD For instance the Erie Playhouse has featured Gannon students in most of its shows PERIOD

The second main stage production of the Erie Playhouses  season The Sound of Music kicks off this weekend with a spotlight on current Gannon student Natalie Pertz. pertz takes center stage as the energetic Maria PERIOD

Maria a postulant in an abbey becomes the governess of the seven unruly von Trapp children PERIOD The von Trapp children seem to be too much for their father the naval officer Georg von Trapp who writes to the local convent seeking assistance PERIOD

Maria constantly in trouble for her unconventional ways is sent to the von Trapp family by her mother superior PERIOD

Through her lively personality gift of song and patient ways the von Trapp family learns to love and respect Maria including Mr PERIOD von Trapp PERIOD

Pertz said the opportunity to portray Maria has been a rewarding experience PERIOD

I can relate to the character of Maria because she is this insane ball of energy who has a lot of love and doesnt always know what to do with it or herself Pertz said PERIOD

Pertz is no novice to the stage PERIOD She has been featured on Gannons Schuster Theatre stage several times since her transfer from Mercyhurst University PERIOD

She found herself in all four of the Schusters main stage shows last year as well as the annual MiniFringe Festival PERIOD Even the Erie Playhouses stage is familiar to Pertz PERIOD

She first performed at the playhouse in the New Years Eve Gala two years ago PERIOD

Technically this is my first full production with them Pertz said PERIOD That is the great thing about this production  so many of us are making our debuts here. in fact five of the von Trapp children are getting their first experience at the Erie Playhouse in The Sound of Music. pertz also said working with actors so much younger than her character is a treat PERIOD

This production doesnt allow for any egos Pertz said PERIOD From day one particularly with the von Trapp kids I have been as caring and helpful as I can be as the mature character and actor in letting them know that we can get through together PERIOD The children are totally respectful but a blast to work with. pertz will have to overcome the differences between stages PERIOD While Gannons theater is a small intimate space the playhouse features a larger space that seats hundreds of people PERIOD

What this means to me as a performer is understanding that the audience is always out front and much further from me than the Gannon stage Pertz said PERIOD

The classic show glorified by artists both young and mature as Pertz put it has been seen on stages across the world PERIOD

Portrayed in the film version by Julie Andrews Maria is an iconic role for young actresses PERIOD Pertzs own energetic spirit is ready to open the show and take on the challenges PERIOD

The Sound of Music makes its Erie Playhouse debut Thursday PERIOD It will run through Sunday Dec PERIOD  and  PERIOD Tickets can be reserved by calling the box office at  PERIOD
