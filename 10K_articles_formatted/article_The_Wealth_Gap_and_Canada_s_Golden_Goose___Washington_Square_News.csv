The gap between the upper and lower classes has grown significantly in the United States from  to  PERIOD For a variety of reasons the rich are becoming richer and the poor poorer PERIOD The prevalence of the middle class has diminished to the extent that its existence is almost as debatable as that of Central New Jersey PERIOD I believe that this shift in U.S PERIOD class structure has contributed to the recent increase of interest in luxury brands PERIOD

Lets look at a company that Im sure many NYU students are familiar with Canada Goose PERIOD Canada Goose is a highend clothing retailer based in  you guessed it  Canada PERIOD The companys most wellknown product is its signature coat with a coyotefur lined hood and a patch on the left sleeve PERIOD Popular among NYU students the coat can cost up to  PERIOD Not many people can afford a jacket at that price point PERIOD For many that kind of money is a months rent PERIOD However NYU students are not the average person with many coming from families in the top one percent PERIOD

Now Im not going to debate whether the coat is worth it based on its quality what alternative jackets there are at a cheaper price point or anything like that PERIOD The important thing to note is that despite the crazy price Canada Goose is raking in the dough PERIOD Profits have risen from  million to over  million over the last ten years and they are only expected to increase PERIOD Although some may look to internal factors as the source of this success a different trend reveals itself when you take a step back and look at the bigger picture PERIOD Its not just Canada Goose that is taking leaps forward PERIOD Moncler which has a similar business model has also been doing extremely well PERIOD This trend suggests that perhaps it is not just skilled branding or good marketing but an increase in disposable income for the rich PERIOD In fact it turns out that the growth in luxury spending is not even comparable to the net worth of the top  percent of Americans PERIOD It might not be a surprising notion that increased wealth is leading to more luxury spending but it does force you to recognize what it means for those who are not decked out it Canada Goose PERIOD

The problem is people arent only getting richer PERIOD As I said before the wealth gap is increasing on both ends PERIOD That means the poor are also getting poorer PERIOD The rise of the rich and the success of these luxury brands signal the downfall and decline of citizens on the other end PERIOD

Next time you walk around on campus counting how many people you pass wearing a Canada Goose parka also try to count how many homeless people you pass.That ratio says a lot about how the United States is on its way to becoming the land of extremes and the home of the paid PERIOD
