If you are of the lot who is stubbornly trying to improve critical thinking skills around the world and feels a bit frustrated by the wave of nonsense that regularly hits the airwaves you are not alone PERIOD But if you think all you need to do is to explain things just a little bit better and people will see the light you are committing what is known as the rationalistic fallacy PERIOD

For example John Moore reports in an article in a May edition of The Science Teacher that subjects were surveyed for their beliefs in the paranormal UFOs and astrology before taking a course which dissected the evidential bases for all these pseudosciences PERIOD While skepticism had marginally increased toward the end of the course credulity had returned with a vengeance only a year after the test Obviously debunking nonsense is simply not enough and it seems to me that understanding the causes of the rationalistic fallacy might save us a lot of misdirected efforts and a trip or two to the psychotherapist when the depression hits PERIOD

The first thing to realize is that many people who believe in all sorts of weird things are not stupid at least not in the generally accepted sense of the term PERIOD Sure if we define intelligence as the ability to grasp the real world anybody who does not understand quantum mechanics is an idiot PERIOD But remember the immortal words of physicist Richard Feynman If you think you understand quantum mechanics you dont understand quantum mechanics PERIOD And if you are a physics student you know exactly what he means PERIOD

The fact is that many people who believe in pseudoscience live successful lives PERIOD Some are college graduates and can understand very well the reality of everyday life PERIOD Sometimes they even successfully make complex decisions such as investing money or planning a career PERIOD The answer must therefore lie elsewhere PERIOD

I think the problem is in what we mean by understanding reality PERIOD Thomas Henry Huxley the nineteenth century scientist known as Darwins Bulldog was very successful in lecturing to the general public much more than any of our contemporary scientific stars such as Stephen Jay Gould PERIOD Huxleys fundamental philosophy was that science is common sense writ large PERIOD Since most people are equipped with both an innate curiosity and a moderate dose of common sense if we explain things by appealing to their already existing mental tools they will understand PERIOD

The problem is that most modern science is not a matter of common sense at all PERIOD From physics to cosmology from molecular biology to evolution our current scientific understanding of the world is extremely counterintuitive PERIOD The reason for this is that sciences realm of investigation now literally spans the whole of creation from the beginning of time until now roughly  billion years and from the subatomic level to the largest aggregates of galaxies PERIOD In Huxleys time most scientists thought that the earth was a few million years old the existence of galaxies was yet to be discovered and nobody had the foggiest idea of what an atom or a gene was PERIOD

Evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker suggest a reasonable explanation for this sorry state of affairs PERIOD According to the standard Darwinian theory our brains are in part the result of natural selection to improve our fitness PERIOD But the question is in response to what kind of environment did our brain evolve The one that we have inhabited for most of our evolutionary existence forests and savannahs where reality means being able to procure food and mates while carefully avoiding that nasty sabertooth tiger PERIOD Is it any wonder we simply cant understand quantum mechanics

So what do we do about it Unfortunately identifying the causes doesnt always cure the disease PERIOD We discovered what causes AIDS several years ago but are a long way from a cure PERIOD We are in no position to reshape the human brain to bring it up to speed with the current human environment PERIOD We can however get more familiar with the large literature on human cognitive neurosciences but getting to know how the brain works has to be the first step toward designing better tools and arguments for educating PERIOD It should also be something of interest to every student and to every human being PERIOD Since the brain is the most powerful tool it may pay off to spend some time reading the instructions manual PERIOD

We can also be more understanding when we confront an irrational position and not dismiss our interlocutor as a simpleton at least not too quickly PERIOD Demonstrating sympathy and reaching out to the right brain may be a better way to get to the left one PERIOD But that is subject matter for another column on another day PERIOD
