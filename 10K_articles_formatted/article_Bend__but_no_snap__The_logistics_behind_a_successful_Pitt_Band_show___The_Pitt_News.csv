Right before every Pitt football game a famous scene from The Matrix is duplicated  without any flying bullets or slow motion PERIOD

Stephen Ruzzini the Pitt bands drum major slowly lowers his back until its nearly parallel to the ground and the feathers of his plumed hat touch the 50yardline PERIOD The move looks like it might take years to perfect but for Ruzzini it came naturally PERIOD

Youve got to build up some core strength PERIOD Its a big trust issue Ruzzini said PERIOD Once you kind of break that barrier of like I can trust myself to get myself back up  I would say it only took me a couple of weeks. the back bend tradition didnt become a pregame fixture until  when the drum major Jason Donovan started to perform the move before every game PERIOD Now its one of the many components for a successful band show PERIOD

The Pitt Varsity Marching Band which celebrated its one hundred and third birthday last week practices four nights a week two hours a night to make sure everything goes smoothly for its pregame and halftime shows PERIOD Ruzzini a senior computer engineering major is the bands chief student leader along with assistant drum major Brian Urbaniak a junior chemical engineering major PERIOD The band consists of brass woodwinds drumline color guard and the Pitt Golden Girls  a group of eight twirlers that has been part of the marching band for  years PERIOD

Urbaniak characterizes their practices as grueling since every week brings a new routine to learn PERIOD

Id say our practices are pretty strictly run just for the sake that we have a lot to do in just a twohour time span so we try to be as efficient as possible Urbaniak said PERIOD

Ruzzini and Urbaniak relay director Dr PERIOD Brad Townsends instructions on the ground to individual sections as he looks over the 260member group from an elevated platform much like the one he stands on during the halftime performance at Heinz Field PERIOD

Townsend writes all of the marching drill  or choreography  for performances and associate band director Dr PERIOD Mel Orange arranges most all of the music that the band performs PERIOD Orange has been the associate band director for  years but Townsend took over last season for longtime Director of Bands Jack Anderson who had held the position since  PERIOD

Although its only his second season the transition wasnt overwhelming for Townsend who previously directed a large band at Oregon State PERIOD

One of the reasons my transition was easy was all those people were here before me Townsend said PERIOD They kind of knew what to do what the most important traditions were but they were also open to any new ideas that I had. he compares his role as Director of Bands to the CEO of a company  by delegating specified choreography to certain people for color guard drumline and the Golden Girls while he covers the bigpicture drill PERIOD

My philosophy has always been hire good people and let them do their job and stay out of their way Townsend said PERIOD

Ruzzini who Townsend describes as very detailoriented and a strong leader takes charge of several game day responsibilities including conducting both on the field with Townsend and in the stands PERIOD But Ruzzini cant see everything going on in the game or the band while hes up in the stands so Urbaniak has to keep a lookout and notify him when first downs and scoring plays occur along with when the band should stop playing PERIOD

Overall Im his eyes and ears making sure he knows whats going on with the rest of the band and seeing to do all the things that he cant do Urbaniak said PERIOD

Combining the practice schedule with an average game day Pitt Band can consume up to  hours per week  and that doesnt include individual practice time PERIOD Ruzzini stresses that with firm time management skills members dont have to give up their entire lives to band PERIOD

As a freshman it was pretty easy PERIOD Now that Im a drum major and Im a senior and applying for jobs this semester  my last semester  has been absolutely chaos Ruzzini said PERIOD But as an average bandsman you really can do it. join our newsletter
