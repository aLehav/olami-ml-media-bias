29yearold AACC student Michael Garvey says his service dog helps him with balance stability and emotional comfort PERIOD

Brad Dress Associate EditorMarch  

After he left the Marines in  Michael Garvey a 29yearold student at AACC and a U.S PERIOD Marine Corps veteran suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder PERIOD He got into heavy pills when he came back home popping almost  of them at a time to ease the pain of PTSD PERIOD

The one thing Garvey said brought him out of the pills was Liberty the black Labrador service dog he has had for two and a half years PERIOD

Garvey said Liberty helps him with balance and stability as his legs could give out because of a wound to his hip which he got during service PERIOD Primarily though Garvey said his dog helps him with comfort because of his anxiety and depression PERIOD

Garvey got his service dog for free from Puppies Behind Bars a New York City business that trains dogs in prisons and then gives them to wounded war veterans PERIOD

Hes my best friend Garvey said PERIOD He makes me feel comfortable out and about so I am not having to worry about bombs on the side of the road. garvey said with PTSD he can sometimes worry about his experiences in the war haunting him in his daily life PERIOD

Garvey explained he brings Liberty to most places without difficulty PERIOD In the future he said he hopes he will not need Liberty PERIOD

Denise Portis an adjunct psychology professor at AACC said her service dog Milo helps her with Menieres disease a disorder that affects the inner ear and causes hearing and balance loss PERIOD

Milo helps Portis by picking things up for her opening and closing doors and dishwashers and helping to keep her balance PERIOD

Before I had a service dog when I dropped something I had to ask someone Do you mind picking that up for me Portis said PERIOD Or risk getting it myself and passing out PERIOD  It provides a level of independence. portis explained she got Milo from Fidos for Freedom a nonprofit organization in Laurel PERIOD Fidos for Freedom aims to increase the independence of people with hearing and mobility problems through service dogs PERIOD

Portis said she has seen eight service dogs on campus PERIOD

Service animals are allowed anywhere on campus PERIOD
