Can you hear me now



Or for that matter can you hear anyone right now



Its two days after the Bedlam win and my hearing is just now returning to normal PERIOD Thats what happens when the GallagherIba Arena crowd goes Spinal Tap and cranks it to  PERIOD



The Big Monday game brought out the best in OSU fans reaffirming GallagherIbas reputation as arguably the best home court advantage in the country PERIOD



Strangely enough GallagherIba hadnt quite been the palace of noise this season that its known to be PERIOD



Sure the old barn had been loud when it needed to be PERIOD Its not like OSU fans have taken to treating conference games like country club dinners PERIOD



But something was missing until Monday night PERIOD The earsplitting floorshaking roar of the Cowboy faithful had lost its edge PERIOD Perhaps not coincidentally so had the Cowboys PERIOD



Until last week the Pokes had been caught in a slump playing poorly in losses at Texas and Oklahoma PERIOD At Colorado Eddie Sutton made an uncharacteristic move and started freshman JamesOn Curry PERIOD All of a sudden the slump was over PERIOD



Monday night Cowboy fans broke out of their slump too PERIOD



The Cowboys love it when their fans are in a frenzy PERIOD They feed off the crowds energy and embrace the noise that frustrates so many opponents PERIOD



It showed in the play of Curry who had the best game of his young career with  points on a host of clutch shots PERIOD The freshman seemed to be the embodiment of the fans waving his arms to further excite the crowd and clearly having more fun than anyone else on the court PERIOD



The Pokes appreciated the raucous atmosphere PERIOD



If that hadnt been made clear time and again it certainly was when half the team ran to the south bleachers to celebrate with fans and Sutton used the public address system to personally thank those in attendance PERIOD



But until Monday the fans affection for the Cowboys hadnt been as obvious as usual PERIOD



To be fair the home schedule has featured some lackluster opponents PERIOD The Cowboys are also under high expectations this season and its hard to go crazy for  minutes when the team is up by double digits most of the game PERIOD



But at times GallagherIba had seemed almost quiet PERIOD Thats not what the orange faithful have come to expect and its not what the Cowboys deserve PERIOD



Bedlam threw this certain silence out the window PERIOD



Whether it was OSUs improved play or merely the appearance of something crimson those in the GallagherIba crowd remembered that when they bring their  game the Cowboys do too PERIOD



The wakeup call came just in time too PERIOD OSU has three home games left and none of them will be easy PERIOD Texas Tech has been on fire lately and Texas AM has gone from an  conference season last year to contention for a postseason berth PERIOD



On top of that Texas comes to town for the regularseason finale and though the Longhorns are slumping they remain dangerous PERIOD



Then again with OSUs team playing better and the crowd back in top form maybe these games arent such a tall order after all PERIOD Its tough enough to beat the Cowboys right now PERIOD



Its even tougher to beat them and  of their closest friends PERIOD
