81yearold former Beatles singer and bass player Paul McCartney recently announced plans for a final Beatles song created with the help of artificial intelligence PERIOD The song is scheduled for release later this year according to The New York Times PERIOD

While the details of the AI methods used to make the song have not been fully disclosed it is clear that technology played a crucial role in bringing the song to life PERIOD In an interview with BBC Radio  McCartney explained that AI was used to extricate the voice of John Lennon the Beatles lead singer who died in  PERIOD

We were able to take Johns voice and get it pure through this AI then we could mix the record as you would normally do McCartney said to BBC  PERIOD

He later explained in a Tweet that nothing has been artificially or synthetically created PERIOD Its all real and we all play on it PERIOD We cleaned up some existing recordings. beatles fans have long awaited a new song from the iconic band and the announcement of its final release generated worldwide excitement PERIOD

McCartney says he felt inspired to work with AI technology after seeing Peter Jacksons work on archival materials for Get Back the documentary that detailed the making of the Let It Be album according to NPR PERIOD

Peter was able to extricate Johns voice from a ropey little bit of cassette which had Johns voice and a piano McCartney said PERIOD He could separate them with AI PERIOD They could theyd tell the machine Thats a voice PERIOD This is a guitar PERIOD Lose the guitar. and he did that. the use of AI technology in music production has sparked concerns over replacing human creativity within the industry PERIOD Some have raised questions about its impact on the creative process and the role of human musicians PERIOD

Justice Baiden cofounder of music label LVRN voiced his concerns about AI use in the music interview during an interview with Complex PERIOD

Im even seeing things where people are getting AI to write them songs but theres still a percentage of human touch thats needed PERIOD And that usually shows through an error Baiden said PERIOD Computers try to be as accurate as possible PERIOD But as humans we still have a percentage of error PERIOD And thats a certain feeling well lose if we lean too far PERIOD I feel like well lose things that keep creativity sacred if we use AI as a crutch. in the case of the Beatles final song the issue lies within the idea of  the voice of a deceased musician using AI technology PERIOD This concept is a controversial one as it raises important ethical questions about the authenticity and ownership of an artists voice PERIOD

The AI doesnt have the same lived experiences as a human Nick BryanKinns professor of interaction design at Queen Mary University of London explains PERIOD It hasnt fallen in love or watched a sunset PERIOD It hasnt gotten drunk and had a hangover PERIOD So its probably going to be a little bit boring. aI also raises the question of how much control the artist or their estate would have over the use of their voice in this way and whether they would have the right to veto certain uses or projects PERIOD Musicians artists and actors alike have begun including clauses in their wills to prevent their likenesses from being posthumously exploited PERIOD Robin Williams who died in  included a clause that restricts his likeness from being used until  years after his death as well as blocking people from digitally including him in a film according to an article from CBS PERIOD

The release of the Beatles final song has sparked speculation among fans about its impact on the bands legacy and the music industry as a whole PERIOD Some fans like user SmoothCat expressed concern about the use of the technology in the song on X formerly known as Twitter Why is Paul McCartney turning John Lennon into an AI model for an unreleased song based on demo tapes Are you OK with this Did you reach out he asked Lennons son Sean PERIOD

Lifelong Beatles fan Melanie Cosdon  explained The use of AI to clean and analyze audio tracks rather than create new music seems like a practical use of the technologys capabilities PERIOD While I dont mind the use of AI technology Im a little skeptical of Ringo Starr and McCartney releasing new music as The Beatles. regardless of its impact the song is a testament to the bands enduring popularity PERIOD With the continued advancement of AI technology one can expect many more exciting developments in music production PERIOD
