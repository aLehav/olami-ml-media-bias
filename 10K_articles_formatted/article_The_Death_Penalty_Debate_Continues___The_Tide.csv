Washington State Governor Jay Inslee imposed a moratorium or a suspension of the death penalty in February PERIOD As a result there have been extremely passionate opinions from people all over the United States and across the world about capital punishment PERIOD The moratorium will allow Inslee to issue a reprieve to any death penalty case thatcomes to his desk PERIOD Many students at LIU Post believe this newly issued moratorium is a major stride in creating a more progressive nation but some students seem to believe that the complete abolition of the death penalty is not the direction that they want this country to go in PERIOD

The death penalty draws such intense emotion because it is quite literally the issue of life and death PERIOD However there are a few facts that people should be informed of before making a decision of whether they support it or not PERIOD

According to Amnesty International there is no credible evidence that the death penalty actually deters crime PERIOD In some death penalty states the crime rate is higher than in nondeath penalty states PERIOD

Another popular public opinion about capital punishment is that taxpayers dont want to pay to keep an inmate in prison for the duration of their lives PERIOD However a  legislative audit in Kansas found that the estimated cost of a death penalty case was  percent more than the cost of a comparable nondeath penalty case PERIOD

Therefore these figures pose the question Does abolition of the death penalty actually lower tax costs for citizens

However some students believe that dollar signs and statistical figures should not be the focus of analysis PERIOD They believe that we as a people should be more concerned with the moral dilemma that arises from the use of the death penalty PERIOD

The state should be bigger than the individual said Shervin Naghibi a sophomore Film major PERIOD Naghibi and his friend Bendik Sorenson a sophomore Journalism major are originally from Norway and staunchly opposed the death penalty PERIOD

Sorenson believes that a more humane option to the death penalty is the concept of rehabilitation PERIOD The lack of rehabilitation in the penal system contributes to a slew of different factors such as a person continuously reoffending also known as recidivism PERIOD Recidivism only adds to the strain on the economy the legal process and burdens the taxpayers PERIOD

However some LIU Post students are able to view the death penalty from the perspective that if people are willing to commit such heinous crimes then they should be punished just as harshly PERIOD

There has to be a penalty that shakes you to the core said Jenny Edengard a junior English Writing major PERIOD If the worst thing that will happen to you is that youre going to spend the rest of your life in prison then thats not enough PERIOD For some criminals being in prison is like a vacation PERIOD They dont have to worry about contributing to society or the stresses of paying bills and working a fulltime job. some students including Christina Urbancik a freshman Pre Pharmacy major look at the situation from both perspectives PERIOD If the person has committed multiple severe offenses like that of a terrorist then I can understand the use of the death penalty PERIOD However it shouldnt just be used lightly said Urbancik PERIOD

Many people would agree with Urbancik especially because ofthe recent terrorist during the Boston Marathon on April   PERIOD Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against  yearold Dzhokhar Tsarnaev the Boston Marathon bombing suspect PERIOD His trial is set to begin on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD Tsarnaev is facing over more than  federal charges for the bombings that killed  people and injured more than  PERIOD According to a Washington PostABC News poll  percent of those surveyed favored the death penalty in the Boston case PERIOD Elizabeth Emmert a student at Boston University who was present at the Boston Marathon during the bombings knows first hand of Bostons reaction to such a horrific event PERIOD

Once the bombs went off the city had a totally different vibe Emmert said PERIOD I remember people frantically running around trying to find their friends and family and all the phone lines being down. it was especially tragic for Emmert when she had found out that one of Boston Universitys graduate students died from the bombing PERIOD

I dont know why the bombers did this but I do know that justice was served when we caught the surviving bomber said Emmert PERIOD Im not prodeath penalty but I understand why the victims families would want to him to be given the death penalty. according to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel only3 inmates have been executed out of the  federal cases where the defendant was sentenced to death since  PERIOD This number seems low compared to the  inmates that were executed on Texas Death Row last year alone PERIOD Through comparison it can be seen that the use of the capital punishment varies drastically on a federal to state level but also a state tostate level PERIOD

In  the New York Court of Appeals held that a portion of the states death penalty law was unconstitutional PERIOD In  then Governor David Paterson issued an executive order requiring the removal ofthe states execution equipment PERIOD Despite the current disestablishment the capital punishment in New York the death penalty debate is still ongoing for the rest of the nation as there are only  states with Washington State being the newest addition that currently do not have the death penalty in effect PERIOD

History Professor Willie Hiatt disagrees with the issue of death penalty PERIOD I dont think that in the age of a modern nation state we should be in the business of killing our citizens he said PERIOD
