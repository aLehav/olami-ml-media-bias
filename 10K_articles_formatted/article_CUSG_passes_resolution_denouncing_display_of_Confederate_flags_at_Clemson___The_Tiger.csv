Letter sent to CUSG by the S.C PERIOD Secessionist Party on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Clemson Undergraduate Student Government CUSG Senate has passed a resolution denouncing the public display of Confederate flags on campus PERIOD
The vote occurred Monday Sept PERIOD  during the Senates second meeting of the fall semester after more than an hour of debate. the resolution comes a week after individuals with Confederate flags were seen driving down Highway  and standing on the Highway  pedestrian bridge PERIOD

The South Carolina Secessionist Party SCSP claimed responsibility for the flag display on Twitter PERIOD

The recent flagging of Clemson ruffled some feathers the SCSP tweeted on Sept PERIOD .Some are still having trouble embracing the rich history of our State. the resolution was authored by Senators Dahvier Alston and Matthew Innocenti PERIOD
The university hasnt responded to this issue  we wanted to show the students that we are listening and working to support their concerns Alston told The Tiger after the meeting PERIOD
We felt it was really important to pass this resolution through tonight because CUSG has recently developed a reputation of not responding to issues in a timely manner Innocenti said. the full text of the resolution is available at the bottom of this story PERIOD 
On Sept PERIOD  the SCSP sent a letter to CUSG challenging student government to a debate on Confederate history and symbols. because there appears to be a tragic lack of understanding of South Carolinas Confederate History and symbols at Clemson University we propose a debate on the topic SCSP chairman James Bessenger wrote PERIOD I would be more than happy to give the students of Clemson the opportunity to hear the other side of the story and engage in a spirited and educational discussion. cUSG has not yet addressed the SCSPs debate proposal but student government did release a statement on Wednesday afternoon regarding the Senate resolution saying it is the responsibility of every student to uphold and advance Clemsons core values of honesty integrity and respect and that CUSG will continue to promote the inclusivity of all student groups as we advocate on behalf of the student body. your donation will support the student journalists of Clemson University  PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
