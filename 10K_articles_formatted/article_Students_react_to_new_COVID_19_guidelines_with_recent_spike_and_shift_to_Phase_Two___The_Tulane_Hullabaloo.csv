Jessie Lehman Contributing ReporterFebruary  

Friday Jan PERIOD  New Orleans transitioned to a Modified Phase Two plan PERIOD This plan requires maskwearing in public places and when with anyone outside of your household  indoors or outdoors  other than when exercising and actively eating or drinking PERIOD

Additionally capacity regulations were loosened from Phase One PERIOD Indoor gathering sizes were increased from six to  masked individuals practicing social distancing PERIOD Outdoor gathering capacity is now set at  masked individuals practicing social distancing PERIOD Masked and socially distant gatherings between individuals not in the same household are also now permitted PERIOD Indoor and outdoor tables at bars and restaurants are now permitted to seat  individuals rather than six PERIOD As true for Phase One Tulane classes over  students and necessary resources such as indoor dining at The Commons and LavinBernick Center are authorized PERIOD

President Mike Fitts sent out an email Thursday Jan PERIOD  which urged Tulane students to follow the new guidelines of Phase Two PERIOD In the email the administration also set forth new guidelines for a Safer at Home campus amid the first major COVID19 spike of the semester PERIOD Part of these new guidelines encouraged students to limit any unnecessary interactions and stay at their residences PERIOD Fitts elaborated that while inperson classes have been deemed safe all other inperson student programming is cancelled PERIOD Tulane is also limiting offcampus students to The Dining Pavilion PERIOD Additionally the university has suspended all intramural sports and fan attendance at all athletic programs PERIOD

Tulane will continue their rigorous testing program in an attempt to mitigate the spread and to recover from the recent spike of positive tests PERIOD Additionally certain organizations on campus including sororities and fraternities are asked to be tested everyday PERIOD This is due to a high rate of positive tests in Greek organizations during a recent spike PERIOD

In response to these new guidelines some students feel that Tulane is placing too much blame and responsibility on their students PERIOD Among those are junior Adam Mathura and sophomore Maya Scholder PERIOD

Its very much like you guys didnt follow the rules and now we are facing the repercussions when really students are 18yearolds who need social stimulation and to be happy and to not have bad mental health PERIOD So expecting  of them to come back to school and no one to interact and no one to break the rules is kind of unreasonable Mathura said PERIOD

Its really putting the onus on students to report each other which obviously feels very uncomfortable Scholder said when asked about the anonymous reporting system PERIOD

Sophomore Francie Benjamin posed another difficulty with Tulanes response to violations PERIOD Benjamin mentioned the  fine for having too many people in a residence hall room PERIOD

For some people who have the ability to pay full tuition and arent worried as much about money thats just a slap on the wrist Benjamin said PERIOD But for other people thats probably like two or three months of their allowance for Tulane. this financial aspect allows some students to fear punishment less than others thereon violating guidelines spreading the virus and having no significant discipline PERIOD Due to the inconsistent nature of COVID19 guidelines and regulations Benjamin believes that students do not take the new emails and guidelines as seriously PERIOD

You get back to school and you make all of these plans and its almost mob mentality where because youre with so many people you all kind of think the same way and kind of crap on what the emails are saying Benjamin said PERIOD But if you were at home you could kind of vent to your parents and then they provide the alternative PERIOD Like they could be like you could not be going back at all type of thing. similarly Mathura thinks there are other strategies that could have included more clear and restrictive guidelines that would contain the inevitable secondsemester spread PERIOD Mathura suggested taking the first two weeks and only doing online and then transitioning into inperson once the COVID spike has been handled a bit better. our numbers are already trending downward and we will continue our SaferatHome restrictions until Feb PERIOD  Fitts said via Mike Strecker executive vice director of public relations PERIOD At that time we will review where we stand and determine next steps. because of our aggressive testing protocols we have been able to quickly quarantine students who were exposed to prevent further transmission. your donation will support the student journalists of Tulane University PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD

Lets hope the administration realizes there is an endgame to all of this PERIOD As more people get vaccinated few people will even have a chance to get sick far fewer ever hospitalized negligible deaths and virtual halt in the spread of the virus as new studies indicate PERIOD Normal should be just around the corner We should be spreading this reality loud and proud

I agree with Francie Benjamin that the  fine punishes the students based on the financial ability to pay and is not an equitable punishment PERIOD    A more equitable punishment would be to require  service hours at Tulane PERIOD

Elizabeth Ernish									  									Feb   at  am

I think closing down outdoor recreational facilities such as the tennis courts and Brown Field and banning club sport practice during COVID is incredibly misguided PERIOD It is not a data driven decision based on CDC guidelines PERIOD Moreover I think its very poor optics for Tulanes Division  spring sports hold practices and travel out of state unimpeded while the majority of students are cant participate in intramurals or club sports PERIOD

Excellent review of the current status PERIOD I wonder if the administration is doing enough to get students to buy into their planning PERIOD",Students react to new COVID-19 guidelines with recent spike and shift to Phase Two â€¢ The Tulane Hullabaloo,Tulane University
