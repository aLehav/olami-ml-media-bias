CLEVELAND AP  A week after trading for Mateen Cleaves the Cleveland Cavaliers sent the point guard back to Sacramento yesterday after he failed his physical PERIOD

Still hoping to shore up their backcourt the Cavs traded a future secondround draft pick to the Phoenix Suns for guard Milt Palacio PERIOD

The Cavs traded small forward Jumaine Jones for Cleaves last week hoping the former Michigan State standout could help replace Andre Miller at point guard PERIOD

When we made the trade we felt good about it PERIOD Mateen did and Jumaine was going to a good team PERIOD Weve got four very disappointed parties in this said Cavs general manager Jim Paxson PERIOD

Team spokesman Bob Price said the trade was contingent on both players passing their physicals PERIOD The Cavs will now get Jones back to play in their crowded frontcourt PERIOD

Meanwhile the Cavs also are dealing with Zydrunas Ilgauskas legal problems PERIOD The 7foot3 center was arrested early Sunday on a DUI charge and must appear in court today PERIOD

Paxson said he has spoken with Ilgauskas but declined to comment about his traffic stop PERIOD

The 6foot3 Palacio will help fill the void created when the Cavs traded Miller to the Los Angeles Clippers in July for forward Darius Miles PERIOD The deal left Bimbo Coles as the only true point guard on the Cavs roster PERIOD

Coles a 12year veteran played just  games last season before knee surgery PERIOD

The Cavs also have firstround draft choice DaJuan Wagner but the team would prefer to have the rookie from Memphis remain at shooting guard PERIOD

Cleaves began his NBA career in Detroit after leading the Spartans to an NCAA title in  PERIOD

He averaged . points and . assists in  games as a rookie but was traded to Sacramento before last season for guard Jon Barry and a firstround draft pick PERIOD Cleaves averaged . points in  games for the Kings PERIOD

Paxson wouldnt say why Cleaves failed his physical which he took Monday PERIOD Cleaves agent Charles Tucker said his client likely didnt pass because of a foot injury that forced him to miss time last season and required surgery about two months ago PERIOD

Tucker hadnt talked to Cleaves but predicted he would be upset PERIOD

Its disappointing because he wanted to play Tucker said PERIOD Theres no time in Sacramento PERIOD Weve got to come up with something. the  Jones averaged . points and . rebounds in his first season with the Cavs who acquired him along with forward Tyrone Hill in a fiveplayer deal with the Philadelphia 76ers PERIOD

If hes not traded again hell compete for playing time with Lamond Murray and Miles PERIOD

Part of the reason we were willing to trade Jumaine is he might be the odd guy out Paxson said PERIOD Now he has a chance to come back here and prove us wrong. the 24yearold Palacio averaged . points and . assists in  games last season for the Suns who acquired him along with Joe Johnson and Randy Brown from Boston in February for Tony Delk and Rodney Rogers PERIOD
