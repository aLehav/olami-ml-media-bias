Those who bank with Bank of America  as well as other banks such as SunTrust  will soon be charged a  monthly fee to use debit services PERIOD EVAN STICHLERStaff

Though most students who hold accounts with Bank of America know the bank will begin charging a monthly  debit card usage fee for basic accounts in  some dont feel like they can do much about it PERIOD

Theres no way I can avoid paying a fee said Aakash Patel a sophomore from Albany PERIOD I might consider switching banks but itll only be a  a month difference. patel said since other major banks have recently begun charging fees to debit card users he doesnt feel like its worth it to switch to another bank PERIOD SunTrust began charging a  debit card fee for basic checking accounts earlier this year and Chase and Wells Fargo are testing  fees in certain markets PERIOD

The fees come on the heels of an amendment to the DoddFrank Act which limits the amount banks can collect from merchants when customers use debit cards for purchases PERIOD According to a USA Today article those fees brought in  billion for banks in  PERIOD

Jeff Netter department head of banking and finance at the University said the absence of debit card fees was a product of a healthy economy  and now that the economy is struggling banks have to reevaluate their practices PERIOD

No fees on debit cards was kind of a function of the same thing that went wild in the economy in the last  years he said PERIOD Debit cards are not free to the bank and I think they were probably not charging enough for people to use them in the past and now theyre trying to make up for that. before the DoddFrank Act went into effect banks could charge merchants  cents per debit card transaction  now the cap is  cents PERIOD Netter said banks might be making up for this difference by charging fees to debit card users but he said changing who is responsible for that fee might not matter as much as some people think PERIOD

Charging a customer or charging a merchant in some ways is not that different he said PERIOD If you have to pay with a debit card when you go to a store youre going to think I have to pay something to do this so you will use it less PERIOD On the other hand if the merchant has to pay it you will still think I will go to the store less because the merchant has raised her prices a little bit. netter said the new fees might even affect merchants pricing PERIOD If a storeowner knows many of his customers are debit card users he might lower his prices a small amount to account for the extra usage fees PERIOD

Though several major banks are beginning to charge these fees Netter said some smaller banks are managing to avoid them in order to stay competitive PERIOD Larger banks like Bank of America offer conveniences such as locations in cities across the country that smaller banks dont and so not charging fees will allow smaller banks to keep up with their competitors PERIOD

Charlotte Fuqua a senior from Valdosta said shes found a way to keep the convenience of a larger bank and avoid debit card fees PERIOD She said she is switching her Bank of America account to USAA as soon as the fees go into place PERIOD

USAA doesnt charge fees and you can use absolutely any ATM anywhere and theyll refund the fee she said PERIOD I think students should definitely research other options. patel said the convenience of Bank of America was one of the reasons hes keeping his account  if he studies abroad he said he can access his money anywhere PERIOD He said he isnt happy about the fees but he gets why they were put in place PERIOD

Its outraging but I understand that banks are also feeling what everyone else is feeling he said PERIOD By them charging fees it sucks for us but its something I think needed to be done. read the digital edition of the newspaper
