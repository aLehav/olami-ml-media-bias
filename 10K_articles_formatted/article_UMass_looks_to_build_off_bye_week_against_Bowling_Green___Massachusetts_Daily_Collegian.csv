With a winless nonconference slate in the rearview mirror its time for the Massachusetts football team to focus on its next test the MidAmerican Conference PERIOD

But that doesnt mean things will get easier for the Minutemen PERIOD

UMass  opens up MAC play with a stiff test in Bowling Green   MAC which boasts one of the best offenses and defenses in the conference PERIOD The Minutemen do have one thing working in their favor though as they had the benefit of a bye week to rest their more experienced players PERIOD

They were really off their legs a lot last week UMass coach Charley Molnar said PERIOD We had good fresh legs good tempo during practice. while the bye week served as time off for the veterans it was also an opportunity for the younger players to make their mark PERIOD

The older guys on the team were able to recover defensive end Justin Anderson said PERIOD We got the chance to get the younger guys in scrimmaging each other and practicing hard just getting them ready PERIOD So I felt that was beneficial for the younger guys as well as the older guys to get the chance to get off their feet for a while recover for this week PERIOD So Im thankful we had that break. the bye week also gave the Minutemen extra time to prepare for the Falcons toptier defense PERIOD Bowling Green has the top scoring defense and total defense statistically in the MAC allowing only . points and . total yards per game PERIOD That defense was on display last season when it shut out UMass  at Gillette Stadium PERIOD

Molnar expects the Falcon defense to be a tougher test than Vanderbilt was two weeks ago for his young offense PERIOD

Theyre just good he said PERIOD Theyre big they play very very hard very rarely have a mistake out of their gaps out of their alignments PERIOD They have seven returning seniors starters and four juniors PERIOD So I mean its a veteran group PERIOD Its what we aspire to be in two years to have that kind of experience and depth. but Bowling Green isnt just strong on defense PERIOD It also has a twoheaded attack on offense led by dualthreat quarterback Matt Johnson and running back Travis Greene PERIOD

Johnson has a . percent completion percentage for  yards and six touchdowns with his arm and has run for a net total of  yards and one touchdown PERIOD Greene is averaging . yards per game and has scored three rushing touchdowns PERIOD Both rank second in the MAC in their respective offensive categories PERIOD

So with a potent offense like this on tap Molnar is expecting a difficult challenge for defense and especially his secondary PERIOD

Theyve got an excellent quarterback a dualthreat like so many quarterbacks are nowadays he said PERIOD This guys a cut above PERIOD Also they have an excellent running back PERIOD I havent seen every RB in our league but hes got to be as good as the best in the league. the defense took a step forward against Vanderbilt especially against the run PERIOD UMass gave up  yards on the ground after switching to a  defensive scheme PERIOD

Anderson believes that the change in scheme had a direct correlation with the success on defense PERIOD

I believe the formation change really helped us out having four defensive linemen versus three especially with Vanderbilt having a tight end all of the time he said PERIOD To have a defensive end line up on the tight end really helped us a lot. the defense has been sticking with the  scheme so far in practice according to Anderson PERIOD But ultimately that decision is the hands of the coaching staff PERIOD

The Falcons and Minutemen will kickoff at  p.m PERIOD on Saturday at Doyt Perry Stadium PERIOD The game will be streamed online at ESPN3.com and over the radio in the Pioneer Valley on WEEI . fM PERIOD
