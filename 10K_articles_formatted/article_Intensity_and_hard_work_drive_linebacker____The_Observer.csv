Editors Note A version of this article originally appeared in the Nov PERIOD  edition of The Observer PERIOD

It is almost hard to reconcile the two demeanors of Prince Shembo PERIOD The intense emotion he displays on the football field and at pep rallies is a far cry from the laughing joking storytelling Shembo present when a single flashbulb replaces stadium lights and a single recorder replaces a sound system PERIOD

The focused intensity remains but an unmistakable sense of levity joins it PERIOD

Perhaps no story is more indicative of the two dimensions of the same personality than the oftrepeated saga of Prince Shembos stolen bike seat PERIOD What turned into an excited angry albeit exaggerated and contrived accusation of the Michigan football team in front of a crowd of thousands at last years pep rally the day before the Irish hosted the Wolverines on Sept PERIOD  began as a true story PERIOD

I was here actually looking at film Purdue I think PERIOD  And I left  and my seat was gone Shembo said PERIOD Its not just the seat was gone PERIOD Its the fact of the matter that my legs were completely sore PERIOD Like my legs were sore before I even got on the bike PERIOD So I had to ride my bike standing up PERIOD My legs were shot and I felt like I was about to catch a cramp PERIOD And I was just so frustrated because I was in so much pain PERIOD I was like Who took my bike seat  And I never found it again. while Shembos more famous retelling of the story represented the height of his intensity during his more recent retelling a smile was draped across his face PERIOD And each time Shembo was being completely genuine PERIOD

The 6foot1. 258pound outside linebacker came out of Ardrey Kell High School in Charlotte N.C. listed as a fourstar recruit by some recruiting services PERIOD While originally pegged as an inside linebacker or defensive end by some Shembo has developed into a dynamite outside linebacker for the Irish PERIOD Going into his freshman year Shembo said he was not worried about where he would line up PERIOD

Honestly I was just trying to play wherever he said PERIOD Just get on the field and contribute to be honest PERIOD

Though listed as an inside linebacker Shembo began to solidify a spot on the outside of the  defense before the season even started and saw action in all  games in  PERIOD

I remember actually we started in the summertime and with the older guys they say pick your position and I picked the position I felt more comfortable that outside rush linebacker Shembo said PERIOD And ever since then I guess they told coach and I was playing there from then on out PERIOD  When I first got here I showed a knack for getting to the quarterback so they kept me there. shembo has accumulated  tackles in  career games PERIOD Fiftyone of those stops came as part of last seasons dominant defense PERIOD And true to his word Shembo has also shown the ability to wreak havoc in the backfield PERIOD He has  career tackles for loss  of which are sacks PERIOD Although he has plenty of them Shembo said gaudy statistics can be elusive PERIOD

When you get the quarterback you know when you see it just their eyes get so big Shembo said PERIOD And this big excitement and he just throws the ball PERIOD And you are just like Aah PERIOD Lets go do it again. i remember one game I think it was Michigan State when I was getting back in the backfield all the time PERIOD And the ball was always thrown right when I get there PERIOD Like I beat the Oline with the quickest move possible  ball thrown PERIOD I got frustrated and stomped on the ground almost hyperextended my knee PERIOD  But then I just start to realize Look man Im just gonna continue to bring it just play as hard as I can PERIOD Whatever happens happens. although he spends plenty of time bringing opposing signalcallers to the ground Shembo said he never engages in competitive banter on the field PERIOD

Im not really big on smack talk he said PERIOD Honestly I say Whats up man. i talk to him every once in a while PERIOD But as soon as they start to be disrespectful its over man PERIOD I wont say anything but Im going to bring it every time. as he has developed both as a pass rusher and as an allaround player Shembo has looked to some of the best for examples PERIOD

Im very big on watching guys in the NFL and seeing how they do things he said PERIOD So I keep a good eye on them PERIOD See how their footwork is here or how they get off the ball here or how they use their hands here PERIOD

Tamba Hali of the Kansas City Chiefs a very big technician PERIOD I try to look at guys who are my size PERIOD You got Tamba Robert Mathis of the Indianapolis Colts you know so a couple rushers like that. growing up a fan of both the Carolina Panthers and the Baltimore Ravens Shembo began from an early age to emulate one of the best linebackers in NFL history PERIOD

The first DVD I received when I was little had Ray Lewis on it he said PERIOD I was like Whos this guy Hes passionate he works hard. so I was like You know what he says hard work. so I started working hard from there PERIOD And thats just been my niche PERIOD Just hard work. shembo has had plenty of role models ahead of him with the Irish as well PERIOD He cited mentors including former Irish linebackers Kerry Neal and Darius Fleming who graduated in  and  respectively PERIOD Shembo also joined former inside linebacker Manti Teo as a starting linebacker but said he learned more from Teo about how to conduct himself than positionspecific knowledge PERIOD

Theres not much I can really take from him because we are all different people but one thing that Manti did say is always play as passionate and as hard as you can Shembo said PERIOD And he always told me that he likes the way I work and that hard work just rubs off and that passion rubs off. now a veteran himself and one of the most gametested players on the Irish defense Shembo has embraced his role as one of the units emotional leaders PERIOD

When theres something that younger players got to work on I tell them he said PERIOD Like No no do it like this or Do it like that. not even just football but just like spiritually as well PERIOD Get the Bible read a couple of verses stuff like that PERIOD And then if there are any questions Im willing to answer them PERIOD If they need anything to go over Im willing to help. shembo is sharing the field with younger players along the Irish front seven this season in part due to multiple injuries PERIOD Freshmen Jaylon Smith and Isaac Rochell and sophomores Jarron Jones and Romeo Okwara are just a few of the Irish underclassmen logging significant minutes on the defensive line or as linebackers PERIOD But Irish upperclassmen look to Shembo to lead them as well PERIOD

He brings a lot to the table and hes definitely a great asset to our defense and our team Okwara said PERIOD Hes a great leader on and off the field PERIOD Hes definitely a role model for me. while Shembos leadership role may have grown in his final year with the team he said his personality and approach to the game have always been the same PERIOD

The thing about me is Ive never tried to change the person I am Shembo said PERIOD When you try to change thats when things just go wrong PERIOD You know Ive continued to be the same person PERIOD  Everything just comes out naturally PERIOD Ive always continued to work hard and lead by example PERIOD And thats my biggest key Lead by example PERIOD Im not going to listen to a guy who says this and does the complete opposite PERIOD So thats what I wanted to demonstrate. shembo has helped lead the Irish back from a  start and into their final three regularseason contests with a shot at a BCS bowl game despite the rash of injuries PERIOD Notre Dame has rattled off four consecutive victories two of which have come with impressive defensive performances PERIOD In backtoback weeks against USC and Air Force on Sept PERIOD  and Sept PERIOD  Notre Dame allowed only  points and held each foe scoreless in the second half PERIOD

I think were playing better than we did in the start Shembo said of the defenses recent performances PERIOD We are starting to get a better understanding PERIOD You can even see it in freshman outside linebacker Jaylon Smith hes improving Romeos getting a lot of playing time a lot of the young guys are playing PERIOD So just getting that experience PERIOD And once they get comfortable man thats it. the film television and theatre major said his only remaining goals are to close out his senior season with no more losses and to finish up his degree PERIOD With contests against Pittsburgh and physical foes BYU and No PERIOD  Stanford the Irish will need plenty of intensity to collect three more wins PERIOD Luckily for them they have just the guy for the job PERIOD

Intensity is just natural Shembo said PERIOD I was born with it. contact Joseph Monardo atemailprotected
