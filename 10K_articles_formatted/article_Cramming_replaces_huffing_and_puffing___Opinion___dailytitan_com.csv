ROBERT HUSKEY  Daily Titan

As a college student I have come to learn that one of the most nervewracking times comes halfway through the semester PERIOD

This period is best known for midtermsnot an exciting prospect for students and Im no exception PERIOD

Unfortunately I cannot squeeze in all the information that might be on these important exams by cramming the night before since one cant risk failing a midterm PERIOD These big tests are often are worth a huge chunk of the final grades PERIOD

This semester served as quite a challenge as I had three consecutive midterms PERIOD Staying up late to study had me looking like a raccoon with dark circles around my eyes PERIOD

Midterms are also the reason I couldnt dedicate an hour everyday to my P90X regimen like I had been doing for the past two months PERIOD

Compared to working out to the Tony Horton exercise DVDs seven days a week I had to temporarily cut it down to three PERIOD

I needed to make this change because my weekly schedule required much more effort due to the tests I had to study for PERIOD As I have mentioned in past columns Ive got a lot on my plate this semester PERIOD

My commutes regular homework writing articles for the Daily Titan work and ASI events all had to come before my workout plan recently PERIOD

As a result of a busy schedule I was deprived from sleep and suffered from more stress than usual PERIOD

Horton states on the P90X website that stress depletes your energy strength and desire while poor sleep habits affect your moods and immune function. this statement definitely describes what I felt the week before and during midterms PERIOD

Overwhelming amounts of stress really unmotivated me to do exercise during the weekdays because I had so much to accomplish PERIOD I felt as though there were not enough hours to complete all of my tasks PERIOD

On the P90X website Horton also said It takes a lot of energy to be stressed out PERIOD Allowing stress to overtake you means youre having a tough time dealing with reality. this statement rings true to me as I was having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I had so much to do in such little time PERIOD I resorted to crying my stress away a couple times which actually helped PERIOD

My average of four hours of sleep each weekday also added to my depleted levels of energy and probably made it easier for me to get sick with a minor flu PERIOD

Keeping workouts off the weekday schedule this time around was not as bad as I thought it would be PERIOD Exercising on Friday Saturday and Sunday still produced some results I did not expect PERIOD

Since the start of my P90X challenge I have lost a total of  pounds PERIOD I have been consistently losing weight every week which is something I am very proud of PERIOD

Although these weeks in particular might have not included a daily workout my healthy eating habits have helped keep the off the weight that I previously lost PERIOD Eating the right combinations of food are making my metabolism work more efficiently even though I cut down to fewer workouts during midterms PERIOD

The past couple of weeks of sleep deprivation and stress were not fun to endure but luckily I got through them with good grades and other positive results PERIOD

Sorry there are no recent results for popular commented articles PERIOD
