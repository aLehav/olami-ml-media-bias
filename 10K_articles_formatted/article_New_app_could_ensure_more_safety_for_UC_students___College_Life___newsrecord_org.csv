A majority of the time the University of Cincinnati campus is a place where students can feel safe and secure PERIOD However it is well known that it cannot be said the same for the areas surrounding the campus PERIOD

UCs Department of Public Safety who has provided students with programs such as NightRide and Campus Watch is now launching a new and free app called the Bearcat Guardian PERIOD

As a way to continue the departments ongoing commitment to keeping students and faculty safe on and around campus this new app turns a cellphone into a security device PERIOD

Users can create a profile of information about themselves and invite family and friends to their safety network PERIOD When added friends and family can virtually follow your location when you allow it in order to make sure you are safe PERIOD

If you have an iPhone you may be thinking that you already do this when you share your location with your friends but Bearcat Guardian does so much more than just sharing your location PERIOD

Once the app is downloaded to your phone you are provided with several different features PERIOD

For example once you select individuals as your guardians on the app you can choose a timer and a guardian PERIOD This feature would come in handy when you are walking home late from a night class or even a party or bar offcampus PERIOD Once a guardian is a selected you can set a time you are expected to be home and the guardian can now see where you are PERIOD Then they will be notified to check on you if you do not arrive home before the timer goes off PERIOD

Another feature of this app allows you to send anonymous tips about suspicious activity to UC police PERIOD The app also has a camera feature that allows you to send pictures of the scene which can be utilized to give a better sense of your location PERIOD The police can then message you back through the app if they have more questions PERIOD This app also allows you to be sent emergency notifications from UC Public Safety PERIOD

Kelly Cantwell the assistant public information officer for UCs Department of Public Safety emphasizes that your location and personal information from your profile can only be seen if you select a guardian to have the ability to do so PERIOD So you should not be afraid to put necessary information in this area of the map PERIOD

Cantwell also wants it to be clear that Bearcats Guardian will not be found when searched in the app store PERIOD You must search Rave Guardian instead PERIOD Then you enter your information into the Rave Guardian app and will have access to the Bearcat Guardian app PERIOD

This app while specified for the use on UCs campus works wherever you are PERIOD However if you are in trouble while offcampus you should call  PERIOD There is a feature for dialing  located within the app for convenience PERIOD
