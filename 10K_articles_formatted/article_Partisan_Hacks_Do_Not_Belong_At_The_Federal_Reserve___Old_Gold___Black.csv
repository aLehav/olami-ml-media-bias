9392,2020-10-21,"smalld democrats that we are Americans are not often impressed by technocrats PERIOD One institution is a necessary exception  the Federal Reserve the Fed where coldly apolitical policymakers manage the U.S PERIOD money supply with integrity common sense and the best data analysis available PERIOD It is a credit to the country that Fed policymakers are able to follow objective evidence where it leads and to put aside ideological beliefs and a priori suppositions PERIOD



Enter Donald Trump PERIOD It is no secret that the president has chosen many unqualified partisan hacks for key positions in the government PERIOD Almost universally economists of all stripes have criticized his most recent appointment campaign adviser and conservative economic commentator Stephen Moore as manifestly unqualified to serve on the Feds Board of Governors PERIOD

Why If your goal is to stabilize the macroeconomy then Moores policies put you on exactly the opposite course PERIOD If instead your goal is to conduct monetary policy based on the direction in which the political winds are blowing then his policies make perfect sense PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD Congress gave the Fed the worlds most powerful financial institution the dual mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment and low stable inflation along with moderate longterm interest rates PERIOD Especially since the tenure of Paul Volcker who served as chairman of the Fed in the 1980s the Fed has also worked hard to earn the trust of financial market participants to operate with strict aseptic political independence PERIOD

Politicians almost always have the incentive to push for lower interest rates especially leading up to elections PERIOD Easymoney policies squeeze out extra growth and reduce unemployment in the short run which give incumbent candidates a leg up but if left unchecked they can lead to inflation especially in an already hot economy PERIOD It is for this reason that we need experts divorced of any political agenda to take away the punch bowl when the party gets started or else we could be carting around wheelbarrows of cash  la Weimar Germany PERIOD

Herein lies the reason why a Moore appointment would damage the Feds Board of Governors he is a political operative and as committed a Trump sycophant and spin doctor as they come PERIOD During the Obama administration when price indices were actually falling due to the Great Recession he was an inflation truther who claimed that hyperinflation was right around the corner PERIOD Now despite clear empirical evidence to the contrary he claims that price indices are falling and that the Fed must apply immediate monetary stimulus PERIOD Both policy views are transparently politically motivated and also precisely opposite of what any of my colleagues on the Wake Forest College Fed Challenge team would recommend PERIOD

Moreover Moore simply doesnt know his economic stuff and neither does he let reality get in the way PERIOD Economists across the political aisle all agree about how loose he plays with the facts PERIOD Greg Mankiw a mainstream conservative economist and advisor to George W PERIOD Bush and Mitt Romney called Moores approach to policy overthetop bereft of nuance and largely offering simplistic misguided advice. paul Krugman leftleaning winner of a Nobel Prize in economics said in a New York Times column that by appointing Moore the Trump administration tends towards both kakistocracy  rule by the worst  and hackistocracy  rule by the ignorant and incompetent PERIOD And Justin Wolfers faculty member at the University of Michigan and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics said More than possibly any other economist in modern America he has a track record of getting the big issues wrong PERIOD Not just occasionally but time after time. indeed Moore has been wrong about almost everything PERIOD In  he wrote an oped for the Kansas City Star about the superior economic performance of lowtax states that was so jampacked with erroneous numbers that the editorial page editor vowed to never again accept an oped from him PERIOD But even that case is nothing compared to the terrible ideas that drive his views on monetary policy PERIOD Recall that Moores agitation for looser money is motivated by his entirely false claim that the U.S PERIOD economy is experiencing deflation PERIOD There are three major metrics of price changes used by credible economists the consumer price index the personal consumption expenditures PCE price index and the core PCE price index which excludes food and energy prices which can add volatile and irrelevant noise. currently all three show slow but steady yearoveryear increases PERIOD

Moore explains this away by arguing that the Fed should focus on commodity price changes i.e. things like the price of oil rather than the above indices and he cherrypicks certain commodities with weird anomalous fluctuations in price that are certainly driven by shocks so they tell us almost nothing about whether there is actually too little money chasing too many goods or the other way around PERIOD For example Moore cites the steep decline in U.S PERIOD soybean prices as evidence of economywide deflation PERIOD But as most thinking people are aware the reason that U.S PERIOD soybean prices are down is because of Trumps selfmade trade war  China has decreased its purchases of U.S PERIOD soybeans in retaliation for the recent slew of tariffs PERIOD Should the Fed a steadfastly independent entity cut rates to prop up soybean prices as damage control for the White Houses blundered trade policy Moore seems to think so PERIOD Worse Moore doesnt even understand the genesis of his own dreadful ideas  he tried to dignify his advocacy of tying interest rates to commodity prices by calling it the Volcker Rule. but that is nothing close to the real Volcker Rule named after the respectable former Fed chairman which was actually a regulation prohibiting banks from engaging in certain investment activities with their own accounts PERIOD

Trump has floated the notion that he will appoint to the worlds most powerful central bank a man who is incapable of using the correct data to make the simplistic determination of whether prices are going up or down and who by his own admission will be on a steep learning curve about how the Fed operates. but the scariest part is that if the White Houses maladroit economic policies precipitate another recession we might not have a Ben Bernanke or Janet Yellen at the wheel PERIOD If Trump ousts Jerome Powell it could be Moore PERIOD
