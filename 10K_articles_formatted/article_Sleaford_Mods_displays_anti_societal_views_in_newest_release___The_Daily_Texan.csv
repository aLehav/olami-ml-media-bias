5918,2023-07-11,"since Sleaford Mods inception in  the duo has caught the publics eye with its vulgar use of language and noholdbarred subject matter PERIOD

Sleaford Mods hardhitting postpunk style and vocalist Jason Williamsons long spokenword rants were finally brought into the limelight last year with Divide and Exit PERIOD With its eighth record Key Markets released Friday the duo has chosen to continue with its depressing musings making the project an impactful but sometimes repetitive endeavour PERIOD

Whomever decided to finance its projects is either crazy radical or an artistic genius but the general consensus hesitantly leans toward the latter PERIOD Whether he calls it singing or rapping vocalist Jason Williamson uses his grit to drive each work home PERIOD His raspy and slurred speech gives off a drunken impression and his lyrics dissect everyday life with a blunt scalpel PERIOD

The albums first track Live Tonight is a prime example of Williamsons lack of filter PERIOD In his first verse he shouts Gig you into the fing ground Im not a moaning man PERIOD  Is that your auntie What dyer bring ya fing auntie for Whats he gunna do

Later on in Bronx in a Six Williamson not only continues with his pillaging style but drops a couple of names in the process when he references Puff Daddy and Jack White PERIOD His lack of rhyme scheme and flow can be confusing but for those that listen closely there is a surprise theme in each song PERIOD

Most mothers would cringe at Williamsons lyrics during his streamofconscience verses but the singer has said thats just the way he talks PERIOD He uses his slang and profanity to criticize unemployment modern middle class life and the desire for celebrity PERIOD

Williamsons inyourface style combines perfectly with producer Andrew Fearns beats PERIOD The murkiness of the bass on each song is juxtaposed with hardhitting drum machines to create a onedimensional but powerful sound PERIOD

The closest this album ever gets to having a chorus is a repeated phrase in part because Fearns beats rarely change throughout a song PERIOD The general lack of variety of the instrumentation makes the songs blend together without its short threesecond breaks Key Marketscould sound like one long song PERIOD

This might deter some people but Williamsons bold personality makes up for the lack of variety and is sure to draw a crowd of niche listeners PERIOD

Anyone who listens to this entire album will leave the experience exhausted and angry PERIOD Key Marketshas an everpresent and relentless feeling of pure rage almost unmatched by any other group in music today PERIOD This is not an album most people will enjoy or add to their playlists  its too much to handle PERIOD

Yet Key Marketscan change the emotions of listeners with just one song proving how powerful its lyrics and instrumentation truly are PERIOD Listeners should give it a try solely for the experience PERIOD Its surprising what one track can do PERIOD
