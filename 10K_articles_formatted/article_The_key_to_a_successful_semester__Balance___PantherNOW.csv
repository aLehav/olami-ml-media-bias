As we students return to the hectic class schedules once again most of us tend to feel overwhelmed anxious and unprepared for the new semester PERIOD The secret to combating this anxiety is a healthy balance between your school work and social life PERIOD

On the first day of the fall semester my heart beat twice as fast as I made my way to my first class PERIOD I was overly concerned about the difficulty of the classes and the strictness of my professors as well as getting lost on a new campus and arriving late to my classes PERIOD

Juggling so many responsibilities the first week was quite unsettling PERIOD Having professors immediately start announcing assignments was what I was most unprepared for but I can proudly say that I survived it PERIOD

According to Remedy an online mental health service feeling anxious on our first days of school is quite a common experience and completely natural PERIOD Reasons vary for everyone from feeling homesick or facing new responsibilities the new semester brings challenges to us all PERIOD

Once were used to a certain schedule its hard to break out of it especially after a relaxing summer PERIOD Returning to class disrupts the daily routine you developed over the past couple of months and introduces a more stressful one.And unfortunately we must embrace this discomfort in order to successfully finish the semester PERIOD

But returning to school doesnt mean that the fun is over PERIOD

As you get used to new tasks keep track of your assignment deadlines and work schedule with an online or physical planner that way you can still fit some fun plans into your schedule with friends and family PERIOD

Time management is essential as you progress in college  with so much to do in so little time PERIOD

The most exciting plans can be the simplest ones take some time to go to the movies walk around a new area or visit the beach or a park PERIOD Activities like these can help take your mind off the overwhelming circumstances PERIOD

I typically like to get rid of my responsibilities early in the day if I want to take a mental break later PERIOD Im not the type to work at night because its the only time I have for myself where I can practice my writing and musicmaking and most importantly wind down after a long productive day PERIOD

I encourage you to do the same PERIOD Its beneficial to relax by yourself with whatever intrigues you  like art music writing running and much more PERIOD You deserve to invest in yourself as much as you invest in school and work PERIOD

Its important to separate yourself from stressors for just a moment to prevent burnout or fatigue so quickly into the semester PERIOD The more you overwork yourself the more your performance decreases and youll feel exhausted and experience headaches as well as gastrointestinal problems and sleep issues PERIOD

Now Im in my last year of college and even though I feel anxious the minute I wake up for school Ive learned to manage and overcome it PERIOD Not only have I learned how to calm myself down but after fully organizing my deadlines and work schedule I feel more confident and collected this semester PERIOD

Because Im managing my time more wisely Ive had the opportunity to enjoy free kayaking at FIUs Biscayne Bay campus go barhopping and clubbing with my friends  make lasting memories before I take on more responsibilities once I graduate PERIOD

Its important to find this balance PERIOD Itll feel weird even unnatural at first but youll quickly realize how great it is to be able to successfully manage your life to prevent mental health issues PERIOD

Continue this habit even after you graduate college because life will get busier and more complicated PERIOD Even in our thirties balancing and organizing our days will be the ultimate strategy to survive the eventual ninetofive jobs PERIOD

We shouldnt be overconcerned about jobs and classes PERIOD Everyone deserves to have fun take advantage of their youth and feel ecstatic about their life PERIOD

Dont let this semester stop you from enjoying the greater things in life because there are ways to manage the stressors PERIOD FIUs Counseling and Psychological Services or CAPS is a great resource if you need guidance aboutyour struggles as well PERIOD

Even if it feels uncomfortable at first the key to a healthier lifestyle is balance PERIOD
