2774,2012-10-30,"mayor Paul Soglin moved forward Tuesday with efforts to develop a vacant lot northeast of the Capitol by appointing community leaders to a committee set on getting a project off the ground PERIOD

The lot located on the  block of East Washington Avenue next to Breese Stevens Field is a full city block and nearly five acres according to Ald PERIOD Bridget Maniaci District  PERIOD The committee will work to approve a project by late February she said PERIOD

The property currently functions as a parking lot PERIOD

Sponsored by Soglin and Maniaci the committee will begin a bidding process for the development of the property in November according to Maniaci PERIOD Proposals will be due to the committee in December with deliberations to begin in January PERIOD

Maniaci said a lateFebruary selection would hopefully result in the development beginning in June  PERIOD

Were definitely not sitting on this were moving on it Maniaci said PERIOD Its going to be so fantastic for the neighborhood and the city to see this property developed. according to Maniaci Soglin appointed two alders  Lauren Cnare District  and Mark Clear District   to the committee PERIOD They will also be joined with two local neighborhood presidents and three citizens one of which is a former Madison alder PERIOD

The development on the East Washington site will probably feature a mixture of housing commercial and retail functions Maniaci said PERIOD

Downtown Madison Inc PERIOD President Susan Schmitz said she would like to see something similar PERIOD

Theres plenty of potential in terms of service she said PERIOD You already have quite a bit of housing from the neighborhoods around there. maniaci said community members have already reached out to her to express their excitement about the process moving forward PERIOD She also said she has received phone calls expressing interests in submitting proposals and competing for the site PERIOD

This is very much a desirable piece of property that the city holds Maniaci said PERIOD Im confident that we will have competitive proposals. the East Washington site is a little more than half a mile from the Capitol Square PERIOD

The property did have a potential suitor in Urban Land Interests last spring but the organization was unable to reach an agreement with the city in the end according to Maniaci PERIOD

She and Schmitz both said the development of the property would be critical in the overall growth for that corridor of the Capitol PERIOD

The Capitol East District is still kind of in its infancy Schmitz said PERIOD This is another project thats going to give it some direction. this article was published Oct   at  pm and last
