2751,2002-04-15,"there is something ugly brewing in the Middle East and it is noticeably spreading to the rest of the world PERIOD Or perhaps it was always there PERIOD
Europeans university students Arabs and even some Jews are condemning Israel for defending itself PERIOD Facing possible annihilation Israel is looking into a world which has turned its back on it PERIOD With the exception of the cautious United States there are no real friends of Israel PERIOD
I am not Jewish and chances are you are not either PERIOD So why should we care about the fate of six million Jews in a land far away from us Israel is the only freely elected democracy in the Middle East and it is surrounded by autocratic thugocracies. quite simply they are our friends and most Arab nations are not PERIOD
Moral relativism pervades our society and media and demands that we not judge between good and evil PERIOD Nihilism is easier for those who are squeamish about making value judgments PERIOD We refuse to say that those who purposely attack innocent women and children in markets or on buses are truly evil PERIOD They are PERIOD Furthermore the people that support them have absolutely no moral qualms with these acts PERIOD Saudis Kuwaitis Iraqis and others are busily compiling money for bombers families PERIOD
What would our reaction be if they collected money for the families of the nineteen men who attacked us in September
Americans should never forget the image of Palestinians dancing in the streets of Ramallah on September  PERIOD Supporting these people is like supporting the Japanese during World War II PERIOD
The axis of evil is alive and well in the Middle East PERIOD Underestimating its hatred is a tragic mistake PERIOD British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain thought he could cooperate with Hitler PERIOD During a period of British appeasement Hitlers confidence grew PERIOD Each concession from the British was interpreted as weakness and thus paved the way for World War II PERIOD
It is arrogant for President Bush to issue demands on Israel PERIOD It is clear that if Canadians attacked us with suicide bombers there would be hell to pay PERIOD Bush believes he can broker peace with a terrorist PERIOD
Columnist Charles Krauthammer says most suicide bombers are from Arafats own Fatah movement. when Arafat says he wants peace he really means he wants a piece of Israel PERIOD Henry Kissinger has said Arafat probably considers interim agreements as a stage to the ultimate destruction of the Israeli state. besides the brutal bombings there is a chilling development appearing worldwide PERIOD It is not just that some people have embraced antiZionism they have embraced antiSemitism PERIOD
There has been a strange silence about the virulent and disgusting antiSemitism writes columnist Mona Charen PERIOD Will the world once again flinch in the face of genocidal antiSemitism
The Europeans harp on Israel yet they are the very reason there is such a state PERIOD According to author Mark Mazower Palestinians lost their land because of Europes reluctance to absorb its diminished Jewish population. after the Holocaust Europe shut its borders to the wandering Jewish refugees PERIOD And with that Israel was born PERIOD
Palestinian supporters argue that their land was stolen PERIOD Perhaps it was but history shows us this is not a unique situation PERIOD The British took land from the Irish PERIOD China took land from Tibet PERIOD The North Vietnamese took land from the South PERIOD Turkey took land from Greece and so forth PERIOD Life is tough PERIOD However there is no excuse for murdering innocents PERIOD Whether they fight for Sinn Fein or Arafat every bomb they make is laced with the hate they feel PERIOD There is no negotiation when a gun is pointed to your head PERIOD
Evidence of antiSemitism mountssynagogues are being burned PERIOD During a proPalestinian rally on a California campus NBC News reported that someone threw a brick into a Hillel center PERIOD Night after night the BBC issues biased reports on the conflicts PERIOD The station spends ten minutes covering the suffering of Palestinians and then go over to the Israeli side and ask one question When are you getting out of here
Ron Rosenbaum of the New York Observer warns that a second Holocaust is a real possibility for a nation whose population is vastly outnumbered PERIOD It is coming sooner or later its not whether but when  The Europeans consciences as always will be clear and untroubled. it is truly unfortunate that some people only respect violence PERIOD But in Utopia there is compromise and reason during heated disagreements PERIOD Israel was founded with the motto Never Again. the Jewish people needed a homeland which would protect them from a hostile world PERIOD
As we witness hatefilled Arab rallies and the disturbing silence among Europeans and Americans one thing is clear Israel is alone in a dark and scary place and a hostile world was never far away from reality PERIOD
