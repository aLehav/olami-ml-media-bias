8337,2023-10-25,"when it comes to doing business a group of Cox MBA students certainly have their hearts set in the right place PERIOD

The consulting club within Cox has a business alliance with a local charity organization Wipe Out Kids Cancer PERIOD The nearly 30yearold organizations mission is to raise funds for research in eradicating pediatric cancer PERIOD

Last year the organization caught the eye of a group of consulting club members so they went to Paula Strasser director of the Cox Business Leadership Center and the BBA Leadership Institute as well as an adjunct professor PERIOD Strasser has been a board member of WOKC for seven years PERIOD

The consulting club contacted me a year and a half ago and just knew I had a heart for servant leadership and nonfor profits she said PERIOD

Strasser said in former years the club had not grown much because they were only focused on theoretical consulting situations PERIOD Speakers gave advice and students visited corporations but they really werent gaining the experience and practice that they needed for the real world PERIOD So they turned to WOKC which warmly embraced their offer to help PERIOD

Gavin Worthy a board member for WOKC and president of the student advisory board for MBAs explained that the alliance is beneficial to not only the organization but to the students as well PERIOD

The idea is that we are looking for ways for the students to be able to apply the business they are receiving in business school during their time here and taking what you learn in the class room and applying it in a handson fashion PERIOD It increases a learning opportunity when you can get your hands dirty so to speak he said PERIOD

Where WOKC benefits is that the organization is greeted with the partnership and skill sets of a group of bright young MBA students who can see things from a different perspective PERIOD

WOKC is still very much an entrepreneurial organization Worthy said and therefore needs assistance in reaching all of its longterm goals PERIOD The members of the consulting club put their heads together to come up with various projects for the organization to meet these goals PERIOD

A lot of organizations  have great ideas great visions but they really lack the ability to execute on those and it starts with the ability to plan PERIOD And I think thats where the students can help us he said PERIOD

Kevin Shtofman the vice president of projects for the consulting club and the student board member for the organization said the projects are directed towards progressing the organizations overall efficiency

The consulting club creates ideas for projects and presents them to Shtofman who presents these ideas to the WOKC board PERIOD This past year the club came up with three successful projects for the organization PERIOD

Shtofman headed up Strategic Planning an ongoing project he created in order to create a new mission statement a new set of values and a fiveyear strategic plan for the organization PERIOD

Other projects included the marketing group which essentially looked for ways to reach out to younger generations by creating groups on Facebook and MySpace and the Financial Metrics group which was designed to look at the financials of the charity PERIOD

In the end a nonprofit is still a business its just the end goal is not to pay the CEO a big bonus its really just to grow the charity Shtofman said PERIOD

In the next year the club hopes to successfully create a template for assessing the costbenefits of the organizations fundraising events PERIOD

The members of the consulting club are not required to help with these projects however the help is completely voluntary PERIOD

So how do these students find time to contribute when they are buried with school work job searches and internship hunts Both Worthy and Shtofman agreed that the cause makes every extra hour worth it PERIOD

I couldnt really buy the argument that some of the MBAs just dont have time because I know that with our able minds and bodies and without having to deal with going through cancer as a young child we can find time within our busy schedules and the school should be proud that the students have Worthy said PERIOD

The organization however has a major handicap PERIOD Worthy said it is the BestKept Secret handicap in that the organization is very well respected but not very wellknown and that is something both the MBA consulting club and WOKC are looking to change PERIOD

The consulting club members are looking to bring even more awareness to the organization in  PERIOD The organization is currently only receiving assistance from the graduate students PERIOD However Worthy hopes that within the next year undergraduate students will join in the ranks against pediatric cancer PERIOD

When you meet a child that is being treated for cancer its just indescribable PERIOD There are a lot of charity events out there PERIOD There are a lot of golf tournaments there are a lot of galas but there arent many occasions where you will go into a hospital and see a child whos had their head shaved because theyre about to go through chemo PERIOD Its a really powerful image PERIOD And its something that is hard to shy away from and ignore Shtofman said PERIOD

In memory of Laurren SmithThis past weekend Laurren Smith a 13yearold girl from Kaufman County lost her battle with Osteosarcoma a rare form of cancer PERIOD

She was one of the ambassadors for a local charity organization Wipe Out Kids Cancer.Wipe Out Kids Cancer was created with the mission to find a day when children like Laurren will come out victorious against cancer PERIOD

One of their most successful programs is the Ambassadors Program PERIOD Staff at Childrens Medical Center choose a handful of cancer patients to sponsor for a year PERIOD The program allows the children to forget about their illness and enjoy being a kid through various activities including trips to Texas Rangers games pizza parties and fishing camp PERIOD

Sadly not every ambassador sees the end of his or her year PERIOD Laurren Smith is one of the reasons the organization exists PERIOD

Cindy Brinker Simmons the founder of Wipe Out Kids Cancer says the day the organization goes out of business is the day it has succeeded in its mission PERIOD

I have been to far too many funerals explains Simmons PERIOD It reminds me that we cannot stop until we have a  percent survival rate. the Independent Voice of Southern Methodist University Since
