After more than a year of pandemic life everyone has experienced a quarantine birthday PERIOD We have adjusted our expectations around celebrations PERIOD As an NYU senior I have already grieved the loss of inperson graduation and tucked my cap and gown into the back of my closet PERIOD Like many other seniors I had another celebratory event overturned by the pandemic my twenty-second birthday PERIOD

Turning  isnt conventionally considered a milestone PERIOD You can get your drivers license at  PERIOD You can buy a lottery ticket at  and vote but statistically you wont PERIOD You can drink legally at  PERIOD But turning  doesnt grant you any grand gesture to declare your newfound maturity aside from quoting Taylor Swift in your Instagram caption PERIOD Its the age most students graduate college though PERIOD Although youre legally an adult at  you become a real adult at  finishing college moving out of your parents house or getting your first real job PERIOD It is a day to commemorate if only with internal acknowledgment of your future possibilities PERIOD

But with social distancing finals and alreadylackluster expectations I marked the occasion with hours of homework pastries and old Spotify playlists PERIOD As I walked to my favorite coffee shop for that carbohydrate fix I passed through Washington Square Park and pressed shuffle PERIOD Through the almighty powers of the universe or the Spotify algorithm I got one of my favorite songs from high school Your Body Is a Weapon by The Wombats PERIOD

I hadnt heard the song in ages but I sang along to every line PERIOD As I carefully avoided walking underneath the Arch I stopped myself before accidentally belting out the words to the bridge I dont come here for the exclusivityI just come here for the viewAnd the miniscule chance of some close proximityOr an awkward conversation with you. as I heard those lyrics I was back in my sophomore year of high school PERIOD I had an embarrassing crush on the popular boy who barely acknowledged me PERIOD Every day we would exit class into the same hallway PERIOD I would pack up my books slowly so we could walk out of the door at the same time PERIOD I wouldnt speak to him though PERIOD I would just follow slightly behind and hope hed turn around or at least see me out of the corner of his eye so I could casually smile and wave PERIOD In retrospect my borderlinestalkerish behavior was simultaneously sweet stupid and sad perfectly encapsulating who I was at  PERIOD

I hadnt thought about this boy or my hallway nonsense since but the song still held memories PERIOD Even at  my earbuds are another limb and lyrics are a guiding force in my life PERIOD What I couldnt decipher was why these words that represented teenage awkwardness felt perfect for turning  PERIOD

Birthdays are always nostalgic benchmarks that force reflection on personal growth PERIOD My nostalgia was only amplified by my anxiety about an impending graduation PERIOD Yet as I walked through the campus that had become my home I wasnt reminiscing about my favorite college memories contemplating my feelings about saying goodbye or memorializing the resident park rats PERIOD Instead I was fixating on some guy who hadnt crossed my mind in six years PERIOD

When I finally sat down in the coffee shop and opened my laptop to attempt expressing the unique circumstances of graduating college during a pandemic I realized what was so special about that song and the memory of my schoolgirl crush PERIOD It represented a time of innocence in ones life  when you couldnt form sentences around someone you like when one smile or wave would make your day when everyday moments felt like comingofage scenes from an 80s teen romcom PERIOD

Graduating college and growing older can feel like a loss of youthful bliss PERIOD Shedding the final remnants of adolescence may make you romanticize a time when your biggest anxiety was whether your crush would text you back PERIOD And if youre like me your coping mechanism will be blasting 2010s altpop PERIOD

Many seniors may not view graduating this year as a loss of innocence but I do PERIOD Before the pandemic I would have pointed to numerous incidents throughout my life as the moment I lost my naivete  the first time I cleaned someone elses drunken vomit experienced a psychotic episode or wept over an open casket PERIOD I would have defined that mental shift as when I was sexually assaulted unable to pay my rent or told I might fail out of school PERIOD For my fellow graduates after four years of college screwups adulting challenges toxic relationships and the trials of living in New York City we may feel we lost our innocence a long time ago PERIOD

Even though I have always expected the worst this pandemic exposed me to new blind spots in my hardened worldview PERIOD We have lost so much over the past year PERIOD We have experienced quantifiable losses like loved ones financial security and social interaction as well as more abstract ones like freedom stability and normalcy PERIOD But what is the sum of these individual pains For many this crisis is the first time everything has been taken away at once PERIOD Instead of one slap in the face from the universe at a time  the death of a loved one or the loss of a job  our whole world was altered in an instant PERIOD This sudden upending conjures a special kind of grief PERIOD

Acknowledging lifes instability can be beautiful too PERIOD It adds a new dimension to your future plans PERIOD When you know that everything can change you are compelled to use your time and energy better PERIOD While I cringe as I write it this principle can be summarized as YOLO PERIOD But in a time associated with restriction identifying the areas of freedom is essential PERIOD

Changing your worldview can offer a blank page for life going forward PERIOD As a writer and someone who hates uncertainty a blank page is the scariest thing in the world PERIOD You have a choice  litter it with your tears or write your triumphs PERIOD When you open yourself up to the possibilities life has to offer you can be more purposeful with your decisions PERIOD And if you allow yourself to question the path laid for you you are better equipped to deal with unexpected changes PERIOD

These lessons are invaluable for graduating students and I have been astounded by those who have adapted to changing circumstances and grown in an era of limitation PERIOD They have discovered new aspects of themselves PERIOD Some have decided to completely change their selfexpression or direction for their lives developing a newfound sense of purpose PERIOD

Some of these insights stem from a place of pain PERIOD Over the past year I have often heard pundits refer to the pandemic as a trying time. yes its trying PERIOD Its also traumatic PERIOD We have all had to grieve for something even if only jumping in the fountain of Washington Square Park on graduation day PERIOD Personally I have also grieved for the future self I thought I would be when I received my diploma a person who was more confident or accomplished PERIOD

Like most of the world I have also been affected by more than one death during the pandemic PERIOD The hardest hit was the passing of my uncle a vibrant man who brought light into the lives of everyone he met PERIOD But the loss that currently weighs on my mind is an old friend PERIOD He was an NYU senior who battled his demons and lost a fate Ive witnessed others at this university suffer before him PERIOD At the start of my college career he threw me into a period of darkness that contributed to one of the lossofinnocence moments mentioned above PERIOD

For some reason during a time of celebration and possibility the death of someone who had caused me pain weighed more heavily than that of someone who had brought me joy PERIOD I learned about his death the day before my birthday PERIOD As I drank my coffee and celebrated  years a milestone he would never share with me I realized I was ruminating on how much potential he had PERIOD Not just to succeed but also to overcome his internal issues PERIOD I thought he had time to grow another area of naivete thats vanished PERIOD

So as I mourn and decipher these complex emotions I am also trying to learn from him and this concept of potential PERIOD Because thats how I view myself and my fellow seniors PERIOD Regardless of my personal feelings about them I see all the potential we have in this life PERIOD I see beyond the things we can accomplish with an NYU degree to the people we can become PERIOD

As we receive our vaccinations hug our loved ones again and walk in the world with less mortal terror we should reflect on the changes that occured in this world and in ourselves PERIOD I dont want us to emerge into the postpandemic world defining our next steps by what we have lost PERIOD These trials have given us insight to apply to the worlds emerging possibilities PERIOD To draw from either Roman philosopher Seneca or modern philosopher Oprah luck is when preparation meets opportunity PERIOD In that sense this graduating class is really lucky PERIOD

Lets use the remainder of this time of limitation for reflection selfimprovement and ambitious plans PERIOD As pieces of normalcy return it is tempting to rush into old patterns of behavior that were holding us back PERIOD We can swing to the opposite end of the pendulum PERIOD Now is the time for balance PERIOD Dont forget what youve learned through the hardships of this pandemic PERIOD Because as you leave your house and leave this university you have so many opportunities in front of you PERIOD Even if you cant recognize it yet you have grown stronger through this ordeal PERIOD
