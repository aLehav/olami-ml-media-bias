If you looked closely at Elijah Johnson the last two games you might have noticed something different about Kansas senior point guard PERIOD

Hes been holding himself higher acting more confident and showing it in ways that havent been seen in some weeks PERIOD Hes laughing again having fun  the whole team is but its Johnson whos the catalyst behind it all PERIOD

When Ben sees me smiling he smiles harder Johnson said after defeating Kansas State last week PERIOD When Travis sees me feeling confident he feels more confident PERIOD When Im doing things the right way Jeff feels better PERIOD When I come in feeling great everybody feeds off it. the Jayhawks have been feeling great PERIOD Theyre riding backtoback victories of more than  points into a Wednesday night showdown at Oklahoma State  the school that knocked Kansas into its funk  looking to avenge a rare loss at Allen Fieldhouse PERIOD

The chemistry that highlighted a dominant run in December seems to have returned PERIOD We hadnt seen the Jayhawks happy dance around since a video was released of them celebrating in the locker room after a statement victory at Ohio State on Dec PERIOD . pERIOD Now theyre Harlem Shaking before practices PERIOD

I stepped out of my comfort zone doing it and I think everybody felt the same way Johnson said of making the Harlem Shake video PERIOD It turned into us having so much energy and then when we went into practice it carried over PERIOD It makes us realize theres not too much time left PERIOD Enjoy it. it wasnt the classic bonding montage from every sports movie but it was close enough and it came at a time in the season when Kansas needed it most PERIOD

Johnson said the team hadnt been able to enjoy themselves lately PERIOD That the Jayhawks were playing for other people instead of themselves and the fun that was present in the beginning of the season was nowhere to be found PERIOD

Perhaps thats why coach Bill Self was adamant that his group was playing on borrowed time at the start of conference play PERIOD

Theres not a team in America that has fun every time they play at the same consistent level Self said after defeating Texas PERIOD You go through ruts and you kind of lose your personality but I think weve got our personality back. that personality came in the form of freshman guard Ben McLemore dancing in a chicken suit junior guard Niko Roberts foxtrotting in footed pajamas and junior forward Justin Wesley doing his best caveman impression PERIOD

It shows team unity Self said PERIOD I think our fans like seeing that our guys are real PERIOD Thats as much as anything for us. if a dance party translates to team unity the last two games might as well be discos  Withey Block Party videos not withstanding PERIOD

Maybe thats whats been making the Jayhawks smile more lately PERIOD Maybe its the victories but more likely its a combination PERIOD The team is executing in all facets of the game and thats no accident PERIOD

Coach has been getting on us about being fast a lot sophomore guard Naadir Tharpe said after the KState game PERIOD He tells us to just go out there and play PERIOD I felt like a lot of times we really werent running any sets we were just out there playing together and the game was flowing. there isnt greater evidence of that flow than when Johnson started off the second half against Texas by scoring Kansas first seven points each of which came off a big defensive stop PERIOD

A Withey steal block and defensive rebound all happened on consecutive Texas possessions PERIOD

The next time Kansas finds itself lacking the enthusiasm that has seemingly put the team back on track at least itll have taped evidence of what it was like to enjoy each other PERIOD

Right now its something we can look back on and say When we were going through a bad time this is when it started to get fun Johnson said. we didnt like seeing each other hurt. your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers",Jayhawks dance their way back to victory | Features | kansan.com,University of Kansas
