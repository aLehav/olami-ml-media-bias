Joe Biden has recently announced his candidacy for the  election he is already pulling ahead in the polls but we as voters shouldnt get too excited about a possible Biden candidacy PERIOD A Biden candidacy would be a major step backward for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party PERIOD

The progressive wing has been making massive strides in this election cycle PERIOD Candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders frequently make headlines with radical reform proposals and conversations about reparations the Green New Deal Medicare for all and student debt forgiveness taking center stage PERIOD

It has forced Republicans into the position of defending generational bankruptcy private insurance and denying widely accepted climate science PERIOD In other words when we push progressive ideas it forces Republicans into an uphill battle where all they have going for them is the ideological platform of privatization is good. this ideological platform can be effective and popular  after all PragerU has become widely popular by doing nothing but releasing propaganda that supports this platform  but when Democrats challenge it the way Warren does and back their challenge up with research data and comprehensive plans to get their ideas done it weakens that platform PERIOD

Democrats are at a crossroads now where we can either embrace positive change bring back New Dealera policy make strides on civil rights issues and fight for the working class or we can elect Joe Biden PERIOD

Joe Biden is not a progressive candidate PERIOD His voting record reflects one that supports unjust wars in the Middle East extends the neoliberal agenda of privatization and global capitalism and supports the war on crime that disproportionately effects communities of color PERIOD Biden voted against desegregation PERIOD Biden did wrong by Anita Hill when she sought the same consequences for Justice Clarence Thomas in  that we saw Dr PERIOD Christine Blasey Ford pursue against her abuser Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh just last year PERIOD Biden even dropped out of an election in  after cases of plagiarism were revealed PERIOD Forget progressive he is not even a good candidate PERIOD

Biden is closer to center than President Obama was and President Obama was not a particularly progressive leader PERIOD We cant trust Biden to ride the progressive momentum to meaningful reform that may slow the effects of climate change PERIOD We cant count on Biden to help out a generation that is so deeply in debt that paying off loans is talked about on college campuses as a fantasy not an eventuality PERIOD

We cant rely on Biden to support racial equality and the fight for a  minimum wage PERIOD All we can count on from Biden is more center left reach across the aisle bull crap that the Democrats have been pulling since Nixon broke their control of the White House in  PERIOD

We need to get back to our roots and fight for equality and the working poor not for centrism that leaves us gridlocked and ineffective PERIOD Its time to let the neoliberal era of the Democratic Party die and to usher in progressive changes PERIOD

Its time to bring back trustbusting and livable wages to once more make efforts support the vulnerable communities in our country and maybe finally do something meaningful to combat climate change PERIOD The Overton window has been creeping right for the past  years and its time to push back PERIOD We dont need Biden we need progress PERIOD
