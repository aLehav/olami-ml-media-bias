COURTESY bubblegum

Since the parks initial closures back in March the corporation has lost billions of dollars over the past months losing  billion in April May and June alone PERIOD Josh DAmaro the chairman of Disney parks made the following statements about employees mass layoffs PERIOD As difficult as this decision is today we believe that the steps we are taking will enable us to emerge a more effective and efficient operation when we return to normal...we look forward to providing opportunities where we can for them to return. dAmaro expressed frustration with reopening the parks in California as they were initially scheduled to reopen on July  of this year PERIOD They were then announced to be pushed back indefinitely as cases of the virus continued to rise PERIOD Weve cut expenses suspended capital projects furloughed our cast members while still paying benefits and modified our operations to run as efficiently as possible however we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while operating at such limited capacity. dAmaro critiqued Californias Governments unwillingness to lift restrictions that would allow Disneyland to reopen. no comments from the governors office have been made about Disneys statements PERIOD

In Florida cast members have started The Cast Member Pantry a food pantry for Disney workers who were laid off during the pandemic to ensure none of them go hungry and can still provide for their families during this difficult time PERIOD When discussing the now additional layoffs their mission is no cast member goes hungry. its a big undertaking especially now with the news of layoffs and the unknown with how long this is going to last. many of Disneys laidoff employees are struggling with how to support themselves PERIOD Currently Disney has not made any other accommodations that suggest supporting the workers that are now left jobless PERIOD For now the group has set up a Venmo account and set up an Amazon wish list for people who would like to donate PERIOD One can find further information regarding donations on the Cast Member Pantry Facebook page PERIOD

As the pandemic continues and California cases are still at such a large number it will be months and potentially years until things return to a sense of normality PERIOD The job market and how people support themselves have been completely uprooted because of the Coronavirus PERIOD With fewer companies hiring overall and now  unemployed workers we face new questions of what to do for people in these situations PERIOD With a vaccine still several months away it is time for new changes to be made to ensure all Americans can support themselves in these unprecedented times PERIOD
