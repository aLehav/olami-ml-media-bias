1913,2023-11-04,"students came up with ideas for how NYUs high cost of attendance could be alleviated  even if by small increments like cheaper meal plans or subsidized MetroCards for students  at a town hall Wednesday PERIOD

Hosted by Student Government Assemblys Financial Committee which is made up of both SGA members and unaffiliated students the events purpose was to provide students the opportunity to voice their grievances about financial issues that come with attending NYU PERIOD

We host town halls like these to get the student voice involved Gallatin senior and member of the committee Rosa Bez told WSN PERIOD We cant speak for the whole student body until we hear from the student body. nYU costs over  per year to attend and with . of students from the bottom  income bracket many may struggle to afford an NYU education PERIOD

Students at the town hall suggested making meal plans more affordable as one way to help those facing financial issues a topic that has been brought up before PERIOD A previouslydiscussed proposal suggested adding a Bronze Plan priced at  per semester for  meals and  for  meals PERIOD At the start of the semester NYU Dinings rebrand as NYU Eats came with a flurry of initiatives that included the creation of an Incubator Team of students and staff whose first goal would be to work on a more affordable meal plan option PERIOD

As of now no such proposal has been adopted and the lowest cost meal plan  flex costs a total of  PERIOD Firstyears are required to have at least the  meal plan which costs  PERIOD On Wednesday many students expressed that these costs were too high PERIOD

We are essentially paying ahead when it comes to our meal plans and yet those meals at the end of the semester just sit there and go where attendee and CAS firstyear Ron Hall said PERIOD I dont think we fall short of good ideas among students but its about how we get faculties or the Board of Trustees to hear it resonate and actually create action with it. students at the meeting certainly werent short of ideas PERIOD Some solutions mentioned were a shortterm meal plan during times such as midterms when it may be difficult for students to manage their own meals PERIOD Other ideas included having a meal plan per dining hall merging campus cash  which can currently only be used for vending machines and laundry  with dining dollars offering a smaller 45swipe meal plan and halfswipes for foods such as Palladium smoothies or Jamba Juice which attendees agreed shouldnt count for one full meal swipe PERIOD

Attendees also expressed a desire for NYU to subsidize the cost of their commute specifically they said the university should offer subsidized MetroCards PERIOD Students referenced a petition by Tisch School of the Arts students for NYU to provide MetroCards to those who have long commutes to their studios and added that it should not only be for Tisch students but all students should have their commutes subsidized PERIOD

Affordability proposals aside students said they first need to know where their money is going and why resources cost what they cost PERIOD Being a private university NYU is not required to release much financial information besides a  form which is required due to its nonprofit status PERIOD

Housing specifically is not a very transparent process said LS firstyear Brandon Kim who attended the event PERIOD Its good to know where it goes and whether Im getting charged comparable prices especially living with someone else PERIOD Im in Founders but I think its close to  a month so Id like to know whats happening. prices range from a  per semester lowcost triple at Rubin Hall to a  single in Alumni Residence Hall PERIOD Students expressed a desire to know how housing prices are determined and many agreed that a way to create consistency would be to pay by the square footage of a room PERIOD

Students also complained about a general lack of transparency regarding finances like with the Wellness Centers budget PERIOD The Wellness Center under the Student Health Center does not release its budget PERIOD The closest information available is the budget for Student Affairs the department it is under which received  of the  fiscal budget the  budget has not yet been released PERIOD

Using suggestions from this event the committee will draft recommendations on how NYU can better support their student body and present that to NYUs Board of Trustees PERIOD

The next step is to start our writing process Bez said PERIOD So we will be writing recommendations to the university on how they can be more financially conscious for their students. email Ronni Husmann at emailprotected PERIOD
