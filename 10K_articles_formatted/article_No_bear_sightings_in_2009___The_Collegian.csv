4083,2023-11-03,"tight end Vince Pascoe the cousin of former Bulldog tight end Bear Pascoe is affectionately called Cub by his Fresno State teammates but hasnt been able to fill the spot left by his older cousin Bear PERIOD  Vince has only caught three passes for  yards in  PERIOD

The Bulldogs tight end production has seen a decline since the departure of Bear Pascoe in  PERIOD

For the last three seasons the tight end position on the Fresno State football team was defined by one word Bear. bear Pascoe is no longer creating matchup problems for opposing defensive coordinators at Fresno State and the current tight ends have not quite been able to fill the tracks left by Pascoe PERIOD

In his four years as a Bulldog Pascoe had  receptions for  yards and ten touchdowns PERIOD In  he ranked second on the team with  catches for  yards and four touchdowns PERIOD

Bear was  feet  inches and  pounds PERIOD  He was a better blocker than all these guys said head coach Pat Hill PERIOD He was a big target and he was an NFLtype player. the Bulldogs two main tight ends Isaac Kinter and Vince Pascoe have combined for eight catches for  yards and have yet to find the end zone PERIOD

One reason the tight ends are lost in the fray is because this years receiving corps has proven to be very productive PERIOD

We dont target to get the ball to the tight ends like we might for the wide receivers because we have great wide receivers this year quarterback Ryan Colburn said PERIOD

The tight ends have assumed more of a blocking role especially with the talented group of tailbacks PERIOD

I just try to concentrate on my blocking assignment when I am on the field Kinter said PERIOD During a pass I just try to run my route and if the ball is thrown somewhere else I try to make a block to spring the player. in the Bulldogs most recent game Fresno State was able to utilize the tight ends in the middle of the field PERIOD  Colburn connected with Kinter four times for  yards PERIOD

The way that they were playing they were giving us a lot of the naked bootlegs Colburn said PERIOD  On the bootleg play Isaac is creeping out and they gave us that four times. in his career Kinter has more than  yards receiving and has five touchdown catches PERIOD

Filling the shoes of Pascoe is no easy task PERIOD However Kinter does not feel the pressure or even want to try and live up to the expectations PERIOD

Bear was a great player but I really dont try to compare myself to him Kinter said PERIOD  I just try to be the best player I can be and do all the jobs that the coaches give me on the field PERIOD  I dont want to try and be somebody else. your donation will support the student journalists of Fresno State Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
