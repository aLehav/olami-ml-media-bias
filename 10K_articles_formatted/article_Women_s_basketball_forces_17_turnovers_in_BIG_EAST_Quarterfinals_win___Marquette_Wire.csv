3237,2023-11-04,"the womens basketball team clung to a onepoint lead at halftime in the BIG EAST quarterfinals against the eighthseeded Butler Bulldogs PERIOD

Golden Eagles head coach Carolyn Kieger had a strong message for her squad that set the tone for the second half PERIOD

I felt like I was doing all the talking and they were just headnodding she said PERIOD I told them I need dialogue I need more back and forth conversation PERIOD Once that happened they got more engaged in the game. allBIG EAST honorable mention Amani Wilborn answered the call from Kieger with a seasonhigh  points en route to a  victory PERIOD She also snagged six rebounds dished five assists and forced four turnovers PERIOD

Butler planned to pack the paint against the Golden Eagles and it worked to their advantage early against Marquette PERIOD The Bulldogs forced Marquette to take contested shots which led to the Bulldogs outrebounding Marquette  in the game PERIOD

I couldnt be prouder of how the girls stuck with our plan coming into this game Butler head coach Kurt Godlevske said PERIOD We made Marquette work for every shot that they got I dont think we had any lapses down the stretch I just think they made plays. the Bulldogs blueprint resulted in Marquette taking  3pointers an amount Kieger wasnt necessarily comfortable with PERIOD Butler wanted to keep us out of our driving attacks and offball screens Kieger said PERIOD We settled a little bit too much from three and well try to fix that when we watch film tonight. along with limiting the Golden Eagles opportunities in the paint Butler stifled top scorers Natisha Hiedeman and Allazia Blockton PERIOD The duo combined to shoot  for  each hitting five shots respectively PERIOD

Butlers zone really got to us in the first half Hiedeman said PERIOD We just had to attack it and we saw more shots fall. however the second half was a different story as turnovers plagued the Bulldogs PERIOD

Butlers Tori Schickel and Michelle Weaver combined for  points but their inability to control the ball led to a myriad of Marquette opportunities PERIOD The Bulldogs committed  turnovers eight of which came from the duo of Weaver and Schickel PERIOD Marquette took advantage scoring  points off of Butlers turnovers while only giving up the ball six times PERIOD

Its just a huge strength for Marquette Godlevske said PERIOD They make you pay for your mistakes so we tried to be as conservative as possible with the basketball. heading into the offseason Butler   BIG EAST is focused on keeping a positive mindset PERIOD

We know we can play with anyone Weaver said PERIOD Weve got a couple new girls coming in next year so we just have to keep working hard and really focus on working together. for Kieger and her team its on to the semifinals PERIOD The Golden Eagles   BIG EAST will play either St PERIOD Johns or Creighton Monday at  p.m PERIOD In the regular season Marquette bested the Red Storm twice but the Blue Jays handed Marquette its only home loss of the season PERIOD

A win in the semifinals would mark the Golden Eagles secondstraight BIG EAST Tournament championship appearance PERIOD
