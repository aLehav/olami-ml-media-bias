It seems that no matter how ridiculous the human race becomes theres always that extra event that makes Darwin turn in his grave PERIOD The most recent occurrence was the reaction of the Notre Dame community to the invitation of President Obama to speak at commencement. it seems that no matter how ridiculous the human race becomes theres always that extra event that makes Darwin turn in his grave PERIOD

The most recent occurrence was the reaction of the Notre Dame community to the invitation of President Obama to speak at commencement PERIOD

It just didnt go over so well PERIOD

The prestigious Catholic university wellknown for both its academics and its athletics isnt new to this scenario PERIOD Due to its reputation as the best Catholic undergraduate school in the country and the many Fighting Irish fans that accompany its image its commencement ceremonies have been host to numerous presidentsincluding President George W PERIOD Bush in  PERIOD

So its interesting that a much less controversial president is causing well a controversy PERIOD After all the president and  percent of the senior class say yes PERIOD

But the majority of  Catholic America including thousands of alumni are berating the administration for its decisions PERIOD Oh they have their reasonsafter all much of what Obama agrees with in terms of abortion and stem cell research is controversial to the teachings of the Catholic church PERIOD

I dont understand it PERIOD These people have to be reasonably intelligentespecially the alums PERIOD Yet for reasons unknown to that majority of the population they feel the need to make the students of Notre Dameand its presidentlook like idiots to the rest of the world PERIOD

What sort of university wouldnt want the President of the United States to speak at their commencement Its not like Obama has all sorts of free time to just hang out and wait for someone to ask him to speak at a graduation PERIOD And if its his views which are the problem well the Catholic church is also against the death penalty a belief of President Bushs PERIOD Students peacefully protested by wearing black arm bands and choosing to not attend graduation PERIOD

Okay okay PERIOD I realize the University of Akron isnt affiliated with a religion so it may be hard for me to understand where everyones coming from PERIOD I did however go to Catholic high school PERIOD I cant see myself ever threatening to withhold money from them based on a commencement speaker whose views I didnt agree witheven if it was George W PERIOD Bush PERIOD Its an honor for someone that distinguished to appear no matter what the politics PERIOD

Randall Terry a prolifer and a 40time excon who once sent an aborted fetus to President Clinton temporarily moved to South Bend recently with the intent to start a riot at graduation PERIOD

His first act of disobedience according to Notre Dames student newspaper The Observer was to schedule a meeting with  a school trustee PERIOD

We held up large signs and we had a gentleman with an Obama mask Terry explained PERIOD We put red paint on the cheeks of the Obama mask and all over his hands and then streaked the sign he was holding with finger blood like a crime scene and the sign he was holding said Thank you for confirming me. what

Its perfectly acceptable for alumni and students who are opposed to this make their disappointment known in a peaceful respectable manner PERIOD

But drawing national attention to it Due to these particular people nuts like this feel free to show up at an important event at a highly regarded institution PERIOD

Not to mention they are ruining the climactic graduation ceremony of hundreds of hardworking students PERIOD

We will make this a circus Terry said PERIOD Somehow I dont doubt him PERIOD

But maybe next time Obama will come to speak at the University of Akron instead PERIOD
