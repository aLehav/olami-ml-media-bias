A win is a win but you cant get complacent said Cincinnati cornerback Coby Bryant following the Tulane victory PERIOD

College footballs top four teams remained unchanged after Week  with Georgia comfortably holding the top spot and Alabama and Oklahoma following Cincinnati respectively PERIOD Impatiently looking from the outside in on the top four is Michigan State who rose from No PERIOD  to No PERIOD  following an upset victory over rival Michigan PERIOD

With a oneloss Ohio State following Michigan State at No PERIOD  it is inevitable that the crowned victor of the Big  Conference poses a significant threat to Cincinnatis playoffs aspirations PERIOD However boosting Cincinnatis resume is the rise of Notre Dame to No PERIOD  whomCincinnati beat in South Bend PERIOD

Also assisting Cincinnati in the latest poll is the expanded presence of the American Athletic Conference with Cincinnatis Nov PERIOD  opponent SMU ranking at No PERIOD  and Houston rising to No PERIOD  PERIOD Cincinnati can use all the help they can get regarding the strength of schedule since the CFP Committee seemingly time and time again uses that as a weakness against them PERIOD

All and all I think no matter what we know we got to play more efficient said Cincinnati head coach Luke Fickell following a win on the road at Tulane PERIOD

It is questionable as to how impactful and worrisome the SEC is to Cincinnati as the topfour currently houses two of their teams with one being a oneloss Alabama program and Georgia PERIOD However these two will likely face each other in the SEC championship which could result in them both maintaining a topfour spot PERIOD

With just four regular season games remaining Fickell thinks the AAC is out to beat his Bearcats since they are the reigning conference champions PERIOD

The Bearcats are now just one of six teams remaining undefeated in the Top  PERIOD The first CFP rankings are set to be released Tuesday evening at  p.m PERIOD
