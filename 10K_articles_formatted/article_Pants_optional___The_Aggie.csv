Although I was deadset on writing about butterflies and daisies this week my JohnnyDeppwithabeard lookalike editor kindly pointed out that there is far more to a douchebag than the mere fact that they are a douchebag as I had outlined last week PERIOD

And thats when my last two brain cells started thinking PERIOD What makes a douchebag such a douchebag How do you deal with said douchebags

There are two ways to deal a DONT and if you must b annihilation is the answer baby PERIOD Recently it came up in one of my classes that a oncesuggested method of dealing with criminals was to send them to selfgoverning reservations PERIOD If this was how society dealt with douchebags it would make for some totally fly reality TV PERIOD

But to find the real answers I turned to the people who really actually know what theyre talking about PERIOD Namely psychologists and etiquette experts PERIOD

To get a psychological perspective I sought out Dr PERIOD Philip Shaver a distinguished professor of the UC Davis psychology department PERIOD

He explained that it is firstly important to establish that there is a distinct difference between selfesteem and narcissism PERIOD Narcissism is a defensive show of the ego that people use in response to criticism i.e PERIOD suggestions that they may not in fact be the most amazing people on earth PERIOD Things that make them question themselves are likely to upset them PERIOD

People with normal levels of selfesteem exhibit fewer signs of narcissism  that sense of entitlement arrogant behavior and belief that they are special. narcissism can be measured by Raskin and Terrys scale of responses to statements that range from I wish somebody would someday write my biography to If I ruled the world it would be a much better place. the range of responses varies from the mild feelings of authority to the extreme feelings of entitlement PERIOD

Now that we know what internally causes narcissism why do some people exhibit massive amounts of it while others dont Its not just as simple as saying that wealthy successful people become full of themselves and act out PERIOD Like everything it roots back to a variety of factors PERIOD Often those who were discouraged by an authority figure and therefore motivated to succeed through negative reinforcement are more likely to be narcissistic PERIOD

Take for example football players who share credit for a touchdown with their teammates versus the ones who gloat Hell yeah it was all me on ESPN PERIOD Or what about those divas you hear about who freak out and cancel concerts because someone forgot to put chilled Evian water with a twist of lemon in their hotel room

Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are two men whove accomplished similar astounding amounts of success yet one is known for being remarkably arrogant and abusing his employees while the other is more likely to make the news for donating massive amounts of his income to charity PERIOD

Its not that one is completely good and one is completely bad its just that one displays more signs of narcissism than the other PERIOD This just goes to show that being full of yourself isnt really about the level of success youve achieved PERIOD

There will always be people who feel entitled to treat others like crap PERIOD This summer my friends boss asked her to call a list of clients demanding that they pay outstanding money because the boss didnt want to do it PERIOD And she stood over her to monitor as she did it PERIOD How are we supposed to deal with people we wish would get hit by buses

Shirley Willey an etiquette expert who has in the past run student workshops on campus regarding professional business etiquette shared some insight PERIOD She stated What we can do ourselves is set a good example and not lose control when responding in professional manner PERIOD The golden rule is to treat people the way you would like to be treated. it may not be the most fun or satisfying way to respond but I guess there are times when you have to leave it up to karma and hope that its a sassier bitch than you ever could be PERIOD



MICHELLE RICK is now frantically scanning the scale to see if she has Narcissistic Personality Disorder PERIOD If you think you have what it takes to be the next king of Australia email her at marickucdavis.edu to learn the truth about yourself PERIOD
