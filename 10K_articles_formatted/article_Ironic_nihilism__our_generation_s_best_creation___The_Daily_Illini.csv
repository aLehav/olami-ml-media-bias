In  James Dean played the hunky disillusioned teenager Jim Stark in the cult classic Rebel Without A Cause. the movie ends with his close friend Plato being killed after a shootout with the Los Angeles Police Department but the drama is softened by Stark and his father resolving their issues while also being introduced to his girlfriend and fellow delinquent Judy PERIOD

At the time viewers felt the film captured the zeitgeist of the times by accurately portraying the disillusionment felt by a generation of teenagers in the postWorld War II years PERIOD Watching it today however the movie comes off as over dramatic and the conclusion as a melquetose attempt to give the audience a cheery ending PERIOD

Jim Stark was a classic transgressive antihero he bravely fights his parents the police and even common sense by playing a chicken run which almost leads to his death PERIOD Compared to some of todays anti heroes however he is quite tame PERIOD

Take for example the title character Rick Sanchez from the hugely popular show Rick and Morty. rick is an avowed atheist and implied alcoholic PERIOD His popular catchphrase wubba lubba dub dub is almost always said with ironic glee but is revealed to mean I am in great pain please help me in an alien language PERIOD The show rarely has happy endings PERIOD

Or even darker the dual personality antihero of Fight Club. his most powerful line Were the middle children of history man PERIOD No purpose or place PERIOD We have no Great War PERIOD No Great Depression PERIOD Our Great Wars a spiritual war Weve all been raised on television to believe that one day wed all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars PERIOD But we wont PERIOD And were slowly learning that fact PERIOD And were very very pissed off encapsulates our generations nihilism succinctly PERIOD This movie ends with the narrator launching what is essentially a violent revolution PERIOD



Fight Club like its predecessor Rebel Without a Cause shares two key things despite the formers much darker tone and sense of humor PERIOD Both are melodramatic and both have served as cultural icons to millions of young Americans PERIOD The fact that the youth of today however did not look for a happy ending but ultimately an endorsement of nihilism and rage against society should speak to our outlook on life PERIOD

Similar existentialist ideas can be found in other popular comedic works such as Bojack Horseman. the underlying theme is that life is cyclical and there is no such thing as completion or happy endings instead there is only Sisyphean struggle PERIOD This can also be found in works by the Coen Brothers whose central motif is that life is a random unpredictable and usually unchangeable PERIOD The duo is still popular with young people The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men are back on Netflix as well as a newly commissioned Netflixonly special called The Ballad of Buster Scruggs a comedy about how brutal and nonsensical life was in the wild west PERIOD

This nihilism is also disseminated through the jokes we tell each other PERIOD As I write this the front page of rdankmemes a subreddit with . million subscribers mostly millennials and Generation Zers features a meme about an implicitly prolife baby boomer debating a millennial who is saying that they actually wish to have been aborted a pasta chief shooting himself in the head because no one is celebrating National Pizza Day with the caption pasta la vista and another meme joking about how the children born to followers of the modern pseudoscience trend the antivaccination movement usually die PERIOD

Pete Davidson the millennial comic on Saturday Night Live who has quickly risen to fame is likely so popular because his humor speaks for his generation PERIOD Davidson has suffered a lot throughout his life his father died during the  terrorist attacks he suffers from borderline personality disorder and despite all this he is a comedian PERIOD

This dark past has influenced his humor in a way that has made him an even more effective comedian to represent his generation PERIOD During the roast of popstar Justin Bieber he quipped that after meeting Biebers father who is known for his childish antics and demeanor he was made okay with his own fathers tragic death PERIOD He later went on to comment that Kevin Hart and Snoop Doggs movie Soul Plane was the worst experience with planes in his life PERIOD

After an Instagram post that many took to be a suicide scare the actor went on S PERIOD N PERIOD L PERIOD and made what appeared to be an impromptu joke that the post was created after seeing fellow comedian John Mulaneys domesticated life PERIOD While incredibly dark the joke landed garnering audience laughs PERIOD

Even in high school we thought it was darkly funny to tell each other to K.Y.S. which stood for kill yourself when one of us messed up or even just made a bad joke PERIOD Despite our generations reputation for being easily offended and overly sensitive regarding comedy there is a silent majority whose taste in humor is politically unaligned transgressive and will easily joke about race sex and as shown before death PERIOD

Generally nihilism is regarded as a bad thing but there is ironically a bright side to it PERIOD We are waking up to our own misery PERIOD Our ironic nihilism is a product of our environment PERIOD We were born in the shadow of  grew up in a recession and have come to age knowing our political system is insane PERIOD We also are carrying loads of college debt for a degree in which weve been told we need to get a job all while under the looming thought that we might all burn up because of climate change PERIOD While our parents firmly believed that America was the dominant global power the rise of China seems to be eclipsing us PERIOD Humor is our coping mechanism PERIOD What many people of the older generations take to be glib irreverence is just a way of processing an incomprehensible world PERIOD

Since  there has been a growing gap between productivity and wages PERIOD In laymans terms people are working harder but their paychecks are not reflecting it PERIOD On top of that more and more people no longer view their jobs as giving them a sense of identity but simply something that they do to make money PERIOD When people in the private sector were asked whether their job gave them a purpose or was just a source of income the majority replied income PERIOD

Additionally the younger generation is particularly hopeless socially we have less friends and less sex than previous generations PERIOD Someone might argue that those statistics are our own fault but millions of rational people do not make the same choice for no reason  material and societal structures push peoples actions PERIOD

Another reason for our nihilistic outlook is that people need a way to identify themselves PERIOD Essentially if someone asks you who you are people will list a series of socially created groups which they believe themselves to be a part of PERIOD For example American Christian University student etc PERIOD Your identity is basically whatever nonsense you put in your Instagram bio PERIOD

However most people are giving up on the usual groups PERIOD As stated before young people are less likely to view work as a sense of purpose or identity PERIOD Were also going through a massive decline in church attendance and religious belief PERIOD After it was revealed in the 1980s that most of the major televangelists were fraudsters who were more likely to be found with a prostitute than in a soup kitchen and that the Catholic Church has been elaborately covering up serial pedophiles for years it is not hard to imagine why young people view the church with cynicism. pERIOD

In the U.S. people are less likely to say that they are proud of their country than ever before PERIOD This is not about people standing up and putting their hand on their heart during the Pledge of Allegiance but rather about how people see themselves in the world PERIOD This lack of pride means people are less eager to say Yes I am an American. i believe that this is one of the many complicated reasons why we are seeing a rise in identity politics and white nationalism PERIOD While I am not at all saying that these two are morally equivalent neither group identifies with the old markers such as their nation or religion PERIOD Their created groups are bounded in terms of race and sexuality PERIOD White nationalists hate America for being a neoliberal melting pot while the champions of identity politics see the American social structure as oppressive and neither group is particularly religious PERIOD

The political theorist Antonio Gramsci once said The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear. we are living in that interregnum and the nihilism that is going mainstream in youth culture is its result PERIOD Which is precisely why that nihilism is healthy it is an honest and often darkly funny analysis of modern life PERIOD Ironic nihilism embraces hopelessness with humor instead of trying to cover it up PERIOD Recognizing that a problem exists is the first step to solving it PERIOD Ideally if Gramsci was right by working through our difficult times the new can be born PERIOD
