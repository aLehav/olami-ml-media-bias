Chris Masoud  Tuesday December  

After rattling off  straight victories in the regular season the winning streak has become a defining theme for the Irish this year PERIOD But since falling to No PERIOD  Florida this weekend the teams second straight loss the Irish find themselves in unfamiliar territory PERIOD

We just really didnt play very well Irish coach Debbie Brown said PERIOD I think the main thing was just the fundamentals of serving and passing PERIOD We didnt serve very well at all so we didnt put pressure on them to take them out of their offense and we didnt receive serves well so our passing was kind of erratic PERIOD It was the two basic fundamentals of volleyball that we didnt execute well. florida joins Tennessee and LSU as the third team from the Southeastern Conference to knock off the Irish   Big East in the regular season PERIOD The Gators   combined for a . attacking percentage en route to a decisive      victory over Notre Dame PERIOD

Although the SEC has proven to be the Achilles heel for the Irish thus far Brown is confident her team can break the trend in the event of a matchup in the NCAA Tournament PERIOD Four teams from the conference including the three previous Irish opponents will host the first and second rounds of the tournament PERIOD

Theyre very good theyre all in the top  but I dont think its necessarily the conference as much as we went up against three very strong teams Brown said PERIOD If you look at the NCAA Tournament the PAC10 has eight teams in the tournament PERIOD The Big Ten the Big  theyre all pretty competitive PERIOD We just happened to play three very strong SEC teams this year. if the Irish are to right the ship they will need to get back to one of their greatest strengths on offense  balance PERIOD Highlighted by the exceptional performances of sophomore Kristen Dealy and seniors Christina Kaelin and Serinity Phillips the Irish have maintained a . attacking percentage throughout the season PERIOD

We have had pretty good balance Brown said PERIOD Theres no question that our outsides Kristen Kaelin and Serinity Phillips have done a great job all throughout the year as our starting outside hitters PERIOD But I do think that our middles are very offensive as well PERIOD They dont get the ball as much as the outsides but thats pretty much the case on any team PERIOD If you didnt have the balance then they wouldnt be as successful as they are. with the regular season officially wrapped up the Irish will turn their full attention to their firstround matchup against Ohio in the championships PERIOD Although the squad finds itself in a rut motivation should not be an issue Friday PERIOD

Its a brand new season its the NCAA Tournament Brown said PERIOD Its very easy to be motivated to be up for this whole tournament and to play well PERIOD I think well be absolutely fine PERIOD Were just going to get back in the gym and work on the fundamentals thats serving and passing and try out a few other things and well be good to go. share This Story

One day after a heartbreaking loss to Butler Notre Dame took out its frustration.. PERIOD
