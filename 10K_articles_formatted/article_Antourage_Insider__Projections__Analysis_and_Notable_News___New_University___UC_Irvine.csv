2653,2023-11-04,"the Antourage Insider is trying out a new style this week highlighting upcoming home matchups and potential starting lineups  and what better way to start than with this Saturdays Homecoming affair against rival Long Beach State PERIOD If you havent gone out to a game this season this one against the 49ers will probably be one of the best of the year PERIOD

Notes
Some sad news  junior center Adam Folker will sit out the rest of the season on a medical redshirt with the Achilles injury on top of his previous hand injury effectively sabotaging the Canadian big mans  season PERIOD This seriously hampers UCIs post depth which is surprise surprise still missing Maxime Chupin on eligibility issues PERIOD Now the Anteaters can no longer hope for the return of their preseason starting center and take on their current roles for the remainder of the season PERIOD

Folker now joins Derick Flowers Daman Starring and Mike Wilder in next years junior class leaving behind next years senior class of Derrick Strings Jonas Lalehzadeh and Eric Wise PERIOD In a way this development could turn out to be a blessing in disguise giving Folker more time to excel in Turners system with improved ballhandling and offensive moves PERIOD It also adds a center to a standout group of upandcoming guards PERIOD

Coming off of a great win against Cal Poly scoring  points on a defense that had routinely kept Big West opponents in the 40s UCI will first travel to Cal State Bakersfield for a nonconference matchup against the Roadrunners PERIOD Last year UCI and CSUB split a home and away in what is becoming a perennial matchup between the two schools PERIOD Sidenote beware of a rather large and awkward Bowflex commercial on the top of the Roadrunners official site PERIOD Desperate times in the advertising industry. the Roadrunners are currently  but got blown away by Pacific  PERIOD On the other hand they defeated UC Riverside who of course beat UCI earlier this season PERIOD

Beating the Beach would be the best win of the season for UCI thus far PERIOD The 49ers are  this season due to a tough nonconference schedule but more impressively are  in the Big West PERIOD A UCI win would take Long Beach down from their pedestal and it would rally the UCI faithful who will be sure to come out in droves for Homecoming PERIOD
Keys to Victory Neutralize Casper Ware PERIOD The notsofriendly ghost was the main perpetrator in Long Beach rallying against UCI at Long Beach earlier this season PERIOD Ware virtually took the team on his back hitting 3pointers and driving to the basket at will PERIOD
