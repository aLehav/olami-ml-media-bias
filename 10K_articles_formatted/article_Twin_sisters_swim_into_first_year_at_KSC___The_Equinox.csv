8398,2023-10-25,"the path to Keene State College wasnt one that identical twins Olivia and Madison Pechulis expected but theyre both here and ready to make their impact on the womens swim and dive team PERIOD

Hailing from Bristol Connecticut the Pechulis twins have always been supportive of one another whether its athletics or any other aspect of life PERIOD While a little friendly competition is always good Olivia said that the competition between the two firstyear students is generally limited PERIOD

We swim different events so its not a ton of competition but in practice we definitely push each other Olivia said PERIOD

In practice we were always swimming on top of each others feet making each other swim faster Olivia added PERIOD

Madison explained how they can be crucial to one anothers success saying that they have been pushing each other all of their lives and theyre each others biggest competitors. olivia and Madisons mother Marla Pechulis agreed with her daughters and added that things have always been even PERIOD

Theyve always supported one another and have been very very close competitionwise with everything academic and in swimming Marla said PERIOD Its always been pretty even all the way through. while Olivia and Madison are ready to get going with their swim season at KSC the idea of them attending the same school wasnt the original plan PERIOD When asked if going to the same school was always their desire both Olivia and Madison answered with a simultaneous no. we didnt really want to Olivia said PERIOD

Madison added how they intended for things to go and said We wanted to go in the same area but different schools because we didnt want to be together all the time. madison also said that the idea of them both being able to swim at KSC is what drew them to commit PERIOD

Assistant Swim and Dive Coach Diana Pimer is excited about having Olivia and Madison on board PERIOD Once we met them we wanted both of them for sure Pimer said PERIOD Theyre both very positive and work super hard. pimer said that when working with them during strength and conditioning she can see the motivation and effort theyre putting in because theyre together PERIOD

It is clear that when theyre together theyre working a lot harder Pimer said PERIOD I am definitely excited to see that come out at practice. olivia and Madison made the decision not to be roommates but do hang out with the same group of people according to Madison PERIOD This allows them to get some time apart but still maintain a close relationship PERIOD

We split up during the day and then at night were like lets go get food or something so it works out Olivia said PERIOD

Marla said her daughters shouldnt have any problems adjusting as they are both strong PERIOD Marla also said that the twins are comfortable with the KSC coaching staff of Pimer and Head Coach Chris Woolridge PERIOD Woolridge graduated from KSC in  and Pimer in  PERIOD

Marla added that she thinks its great that Madison and Olivia are at the same school PERIOD We were a little unsure of what was going to happen Marla said but the transition seems to be going easier than we thought it would be. the adjustment period for firstyears who are coming in can be difficult especially as a studentathlete PERIOD However Marla is confident that Olivia and Madison are capable of handling the challenge PERIOD

Theyve certainly had a busy life up until now but theyve got great focus Marla said PERIOD She added Weve raised them saying that you can have it all. crae Messer can be contacted atcmesserkscequinox.com
