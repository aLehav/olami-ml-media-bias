While of the student body was at home visiting family for Thanksgiving break the Grand Valley State mens basketball team was busy adding another win to their record beating Grace Christian  in a home matchup PERIOD

With Grace Christian running a twothree zone for the majority of the game the Lakers started out with a lack of energy but got ah old of how to handle the defense as the game went along PERIOD

This is the most zone weve seen all season and in that first half they got us standing around a bit said head coach Ric Wesley PERIOD In the second half we worked the ball a little better got the ball in the high post and we just got better shots since we were willing to work more. being patient and not settling for shots helped GVSU find and make open threepoint shots as the team combined to hit  threes including shooting . percent from deep in the second half PERIOD

Five of those key threepointers came from Hunter Hale who led the team with  points to go along with five assists and four rebounds PERIOD

Ive been getting a lot of shots up outside of practice Hale said PERIOD Its not surprising since I work on it so much and I expect that success PERIOD I expect myself to shoot well I just keep pushing myself to keep shooting well like that. while Hale did lead GVSU in scoring he was far from the only Laker to find offensive success PERIOD Jeremiah Ferguson followed right behind him with  points as Justin Greason and Demetrius Lake were both able to score  points each off the bench PERIOD

Its safe to say this will be a game that Lake will remember as the four threepointers he hit were the first points Lake put up in his young Laker career PERIOD Lake took a very humble approach when asked how that offensive success felt crediting his teammates for making it happen PERIOD

My teammates got me open and got me in the right spots Lake said PERIOD My teammates were able to move the ball and help me get wide open shots in the twothree zone and it felt good. lake is far from just a sharpshooter for GVSU as his defensive hustle knowledge of his role and ability to talk on defense really helps his teammates on the other side of the court PERIOD

We need to communicate on defense because defense is one of our biggest priorities on this team Lake said PERIOD Coach stresses that a lot we just got to communicate on defense to win games and with me coming off the bench I just try to bring energy and be the glue guy. with the win GVSU improves to  on the year PERIOD The team deserves a holiday break just like the rest of the students on campus so theyll have eight days off before their next game against WisconsinParkside PERIOD

While the break will be nice to help the team recharge their batteries Wesley wants them to avoid complacency as they still need to improve in a lot of areas before conference play PERIOD

We were working pretty good our guys were communicating well we just got to extend the amount of time where we play at a high level particularly when we get into conference play Wesley said PERIOD A lot of guys played and a lot of guys had success tonight so hopefully we can build on that when we get back. gVSU heads to WisconsinParkside on Thursday Nov PERIOD  for a road matchup with the Rangers PERIOD Tipoff is set for  p.m PERIOD
