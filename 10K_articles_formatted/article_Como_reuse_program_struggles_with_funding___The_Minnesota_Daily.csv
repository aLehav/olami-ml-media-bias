5061,2023-11-04,"a program that aims to eliminate curbside waste is in danger this fall PERIOD

by  Megan GoschPublished  August  

This fall Southeast Comos neighborhood free store may not be an option for students moving off campus PERIOD

As of Monday funding had not been secured for Move InMove Out the waste reduction project utilized by students and residents looking to donate and pick up reusable household items during moving season PERIOD

Without outside funding the Southeast Como Improvement Association will not be able to host MIMO for the fall moving season said Justin Eibenholzl an environmental coordinator for SECIA and an organizer of the MIMO project PERIOD

The MIMO event set for the spring  moving cycle was canceled also due to a lack of funding PERIOD

Throughout the past four MIMO events almost  pounds of furniture and household goods have been diverted to attendees and more than  people have participated PERIOD

Before this project Como was seeing huge amounts of usable furniture being thrown out said Alison Henderson a University of Minnesota student and an intern for SECIA. mIMO became a way to mitigate that wasteful habit and provide an alternative that was convenient for everyone. in the past MIMO has been funded by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency the McKnight Foundation and the University of Minnesota Good Neighbor Fund PERIOD

Although the Pollution Control Agency supported the project from  to  the agency can no longer fund MIMO due to specific grant limitations PERIOD

Madalyn Cioci a waste prevention specialist and Minnesota Pollution Control Agencys grant manager for the MIMO project said the grant was not designed to provide ongoing operational funds for projects PERIOD

The program under which MIMO was funded is intended for innovative firsttimeout projects to give them a kickstart she said PERIOD

Eibenholzl said currently the cost of organizing the event coordinating volunteer staff and getting the materials to promote it are too expensive unless it receives outside funding PERIOD

Southeast Como residents said its hard to understand why a program like MIMO would not receive funding PERIOD

If you think about it this one event is lowering our carbon footprint said Ashley McDonell University student and Southeast Como resident PERIOD It reduces our neighborhoods waste helps out our neighbors and its free PERIOD With all of the benefits in mind why wouldnt they have support

While finding funds for MIMO has been difficult in the past Eibenholzl said some organizations have begun to scale back their funding efforts while competition for available grants has increased PERIOD The benefits of the project have also been difficult to quantify when applying for grants PERIOD

The project helps everyone involved Eibenholzl said PERIOD Neighbors arent bothered by piles of trash on their curb the city isnt burdened to pick up piles of extra trash and students have a way to dispose of the things they dont want while picking up things they do need for free. the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency is continuing to work with the Southeast Como Improvement Association to find partnerships within the community that could create a more sustainable program and would not rely on continued grant funding Cioci said PERIOD

The organization is considering a potential membership model partnership with landlords and sponsorship from local businesses as possible methods of fundraising for future MIMO events PERIOD

A project like this makes sense Henderson said PERIOD Its just unfortunate we havent gotten the support weve been looking for PERIOD Well find a way to make it happen one way or another. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
