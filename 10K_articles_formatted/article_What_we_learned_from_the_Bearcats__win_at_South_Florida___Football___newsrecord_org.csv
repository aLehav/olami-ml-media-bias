USF safety DeVontres Dukes  tackles Cincinnati wide receiver Tre Tucker  in the backfield for a loss of during the first quarter at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Fla. on Saturday Nov PERIOD   PERIOD Cincinnati won  PERIOD Octavio JonesTampa Bay TimesTNS

Kicker Sam Crosa came up clutch for the No PERIOD  University of Cincinnati football team for the second time in three weeks connecting on a 37yard field goal as time expired to defeat University of South Florida  PERIOD

Crosa won the Bearcats more than just another football game as UC clinched at least a share of the American Athletic Conference East with the win PERIOD It also keeps the hopes alive for a potential Cotton Bowl appearance PERIOD

The Bearcats finished with  total yards of offense and went into halftime without a point on the board but were able to make a second half comeback and improve to  PERIOD

Here is what we learned

The Bearcats faced thirdand10 from their own 30yardline with a minute left in the fourth quarter PERIOD Sophomore quarterback Desmond Ridder dropped back and quickly became under pressure before completing a short pass to junior running back Michael Warren II who ran  yards into USF territory PERIOD

Warren was then given the ball four straight times adding another  yards to set up the gamewinning field goal PERIOD He finished with  rushing yards  his third 100plus rushing game of the season  and a touchdown PERIOD

Warren is in the midst of a big finish to the regular season and Saturday was another example of how important he has become to the team PERIOD

Crosa a graduate transfer is 9of12 on field goal attempts this season and his three misses have been blocked PERIOD He previously kicked a gamewinning field goal to cap off UCs 14point comeback at East Carolina University ECU Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

Despite the frustrations with the blocked kicks that may or may not have been his fault Crosa has been a deadeye in the  to 45yard range PERIOD

It seems the Bearcats always find a way to pull out a win no matter what the circumstances are and theyve done so by forcing turnovers PERIOD

Cornerback Ahmad Gardners two picksixs against the University of Central Florida and ECU linebacker Bryan Wrights tipped pass that was intercepted in the end zone by fellow linebacker Perry Young against Houston and a forced fumble by safety JaVon Hicks in the fourth quarter against the University of South Florida have all been significant moments in wins PERIOD

UC is seventeenth in the country with a turnover margin of . . at home and have scored  points off turnovers this season PERIOD

The way the Bearcats have been able to pull out close games in the fourth quarter goes beyond just forcing turnovers PERIOD Ridder Warren and the special teams have played a big part and forcing turnovers takes it to another level PERIOD
