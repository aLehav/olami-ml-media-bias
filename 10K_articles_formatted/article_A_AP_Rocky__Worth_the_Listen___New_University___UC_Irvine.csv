2637,2023-11-04,"since LiveLoveAAP dropped on Halloween  AAP Rocky has found few doubters PERIOD Really the only consistent critique of the muchpraised mixtape focuses on the Harlemdarlings supposed lack of depth despite his exquisite taste in beats and smoothasbutter flow doubters say AAP Rocky doesnt talk about much more than purple drink dice women weed and brews PERIOD

Its true PERIOD Rockys music is largely a celebration of good times PERIOD And the hedonistic tradition continues on LongLiveAAP AAP Rockys majorlabel debut PERIOD

Little codeine n get throwed right  Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night he raps in PMW  a pulsating acronymic track about women cash and cannabis PERIOD

The immoderation especially delivered on top of choice beats is both joyful and aspirational as rap should be PERIOD But Rocky cant survive on style alone PERIOD Luckily the album is both historically aware and comfortably introspective PERIOD

Its not hard to think that LongLiveAAP is as much an adage to Rockys love for the genre as it is an ode to red bottom loafers just to complement the mink. for every epicurean preference described with immaculate flow theres a reference to the rappers whose shoulders Rocky stands on PERIOD

And thats what makes the album so wonderful PERIOD Rocky isnt rapping about suicide doors and supersized female thighs because he lacks personal depth read Wiz Khalifa PERIOD He does so because he understands his historical context in rap PERIOD The complex beats that almost blend hook and verse are part of his era PERIOD And he embraces the style all while nodding to earlier influences PERIOD

Take  Train. the hookless song features Rocky along with six other rappers each eager to deliver their  bars PERIOD The tracks inclusion on the album is a neat reference to the music that influenced Rocky its Wu with modern panache all served over a HitBoy produced track  always a winner PERIOD

Fans of Rocky will be relieved to know that strains of familiarity surface on LongLiveAAP. rocky favorite Clams Casino produces two tracks LVL and Hell. rocky also delivers in the hits department with both Goldie and Fuckin Problems sure to bump for a while PERIOD And the familiar pitchmodified voice is still lurking in between hooks and under verses PERIOD

But the highlight of the album arrives a little over halfway on Phoenix. rocky who was arrested for assaulting a paparazzi last summer concedes Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide  Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized. in a later verse he switches out Michael Jackson for Kurt Kobain PERIOD

The song isnt a cheap alright lets do something emotional effort PERIOD Its Rocky at his most vulnerable PERIOD Yes Rocky enjoys wealth fame women and controlled substances on a daily basis PERIOD In fact the fight with the paps began after he was photographed taking illegal drugs while shopping. but hes not free from pressure PERIOD Its a fine line walking between complaining and introspection but the supposedly shallow Rocky handles it well PERIOD

The album fails in one place PERIOD Fashion Killa is a song for the ladies as an AR at RCA probably described it where Rocky namedrops his favorite brands as an explanation for why he loves a girl PERIOD With corny lines like She jiggy like Madonna but she trippy like Nirvana its a wonder that Rocky can produce something as wonderful as Phoenix which unfortunately follows Fashion Killa on the track listing PERIOD

Still get the album PERIOD Add Fuckin Problems Goldie Angels Wild for the Night and Hell to your party mix PERIOD Listen to Phoenix LVL and Pain with someone you love  but probably not your parents PERIOD Then close your eyes and listen to LongLiveAAP in its entirety PERIOD Theres a lot to work with here PERIOD
