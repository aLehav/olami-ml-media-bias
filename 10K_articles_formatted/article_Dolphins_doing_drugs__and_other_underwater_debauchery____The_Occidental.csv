Apparently young dolphins love to get high PERIOD

Though this statement has not yet been supported by scientific findings the BBC One show Dolphins A Spy in the Pod used dummy marine animals outfitted with video cameras to observe the natural behavior of dolphins PERIOD

The spy recorded young dolphins catching and chewing on a pufferfish passing the toxinfilled fish around to one another PERIOD The dolphins then began to act high swimming in loopy circles and gazing at their reflections at the surface PERIOD

While one might assume that pufferfish are difficult to light underwater it is speculated that the young dolphins chew on the fish to consume its toxin which in small doses can produce a narcotic effect PERIOD The adorable fish fill themselves with water to puff up when they feel threatened filling up with the toxin tetrodotoxin PERIOD Roughly a thousand times more deadly to humans than cyanide an antidote to tetrodotoxin has yet to be discovered PERIOD  Tetrodotoxin can sometimes be lethal to fish but to dolphins it seems that the toxin is more titillating than deadly PERIOD

Humans have been fascinated by the intelligence and personality of dolphins but there seems to be a disconnect between the respect for these creatures in the wild and national security interests PERIOD Since militaries started using sonar technology there has been an increase in the strandings of dolphins and whales PERIOD Scientists speculate that the animals who normally rely on echolocation to navigate vast distances become confused and misled by the sonar in some cases trapping or beaching themselves in locations that they would normally not travel to PERIOD Dolphins also rely on acoustics to mate and communicate and sonar can disrupt these patterns PERIOD

The more scientists learn about dolphins the more we are confronted with the enormity of their intelligence PERIOD From chewing on pufferfish to utilizing advanced navigational skills these creatures must be protected from human action that threatens their fragile ecosystem PERIOD Environmental groups are currently protesting the U.S PERIOD Navys use of sonar in critical dolphin mating areas hoping to address one human activity that has a profound impact on the animal PERIOD To be responsible caretakers of the oceans we must continue to learn about marine animals and adjust our practices in the ocean to ensure they have a presence in the oceans for years to come PERIOD
