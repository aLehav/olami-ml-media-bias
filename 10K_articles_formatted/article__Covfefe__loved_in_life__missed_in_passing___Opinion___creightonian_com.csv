A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 39F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Oh covfefe greatest of spelling errors truly you brought us into a golden age of American politics PERIOD While politicians on all sides tried to tear us apart you brought us together PERIOD Nambia shall never replace you in our hearts PERIOD

What is covfefe A question that has been upon the lips and minds of philosophers politicians and comedians alike PERIOD You have dominated the publics collective imagination spurring new fields of late night talk show jokes and Twitter memes PERIOD

When the fateful tweet left our glorious leaders hands it was apparent that the greatest of political phenomenon had occurred PERIOD Instantly BuzzFeed braced itself to have its biggest quarter ever PERIOD The top reporters of cable networks everywhere began working overtime to formulate the angriest responses PERIOD The New Yorker and Atlantic put together a team of their most pretentious writers to delve into your political meanings

And you didnt fail to disappoint PERIOD

Why had our president chosen to bless us with you Had he dropped his phone Was he having a stroke Had a staffer realizing the dire need to stop what was sure to become an illbegotten rant ripped the phone from his hands Were you just a simple spelling mistake

Through you we have learned to love to laugh to cry  to sneak in a poor coffee pun at every opportunity PERIOD You have shown us things that we may have never known about ourselves PERIOD

As you take your final breaths mercilessly jammed into headlines introducing your successor we remember that it will never outshine you PERIOD

How does Nambia come close to doing what youve done Youve torn apart the social fabric shredded it and reweaved it in a matter of months PERIOD What was once the ugliest of Christmas sweaters has become the envy of Coco Chanel PERIOD Nambia cant hold a candle to your graces PERIOD It stumbles like a threelegged mutt chasing a snow leopard PERIOD

You were the first the alpha the OG PERIOD You were there when hope was the least  brightest of lights in the darkness PERIOD When we questioned what was to come  what Donald Trump had in mind for this fledgling presidency  you stepped in and answered for him so simply just covfefe. has Nambia dominated the news cycle Has Nambia made us ignore important legislative and executive actions in favor of sweet sweet memes Has Nambia had the same forced jokes repeated at every opportunity No no on all counts PERIOD

Nambia is just a passing phase PERIOD There is no question no unknown to probe to bring deep philosophical thought PERIOD Its but the unholy portmanteau of Zambia and Namibia born out of the sad plight of Trumps tendency to speak extemporaneously and poor knowledge of African geography PERIOD Its here today and gone tomorrow  but a passing fad PERIOD

Covfefeas the sun sets on your dynasty nay on your empire I cant help but feel tears welling in my eyes PERIOD Not of sadness but of joy PERIOD As the dark night approaches I do not feel fear PERIOD For though the night comes I know it will be short PERIOD

And in the morning maybe together we will once again be able to share a nice cup of covfefe. but anyway they should be careful with sites like httpsonlinecasino61.com.au if they are considering to save some money PERIOD
