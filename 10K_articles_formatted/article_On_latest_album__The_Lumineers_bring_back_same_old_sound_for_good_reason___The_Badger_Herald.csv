Since the release of their selftitled debut album in  most of the world has probably forgotten about Denverbased folkrock band The Lumineers PERIOD

You may have heard Hey Ho come on in a coffee shop and thoughtOh hey I love this song and proceeded to hum along PERIOD But that is probably the only thought youve given them lately PERIOD

But with the release of their latest albumCleopatra and an upcoming world tour the band has made it clear theyre back  and this time theyre here to stay PERIOD

The album starts off strong with tracks Sleep On The Floor Ophelia and Cleopatra reminding listeners why they love The Lumineers PERIOD Each track showcases their staple traits including lead singer Wesley Schultzs soulful vocals heavy guitar riffs marching bandstyle drumming intricate piano melodies and poetic lyrics PERIOD

As the album progresses the songs become slower and simpler PERIOD One standout track Angela has moving lyrics and a beautiful melody PERIOD

But much like their first albumCleopatrahas little diversity among its songs PERIOD Fans of the bands simplistic indie sound will appreciate the continuity but it gets old quickly PERIOD

Many of the tracks are too similar and since the album is so short   songs totaling in  minutes  the album feels tired after just a few listens PERIOD The likeliness between songs even travels betweenalbums PERIOD Sick In The Head off Cleopatra has an almost identical guitar line to Flowers In Your Hair off their first album PERIOD

That being said the band is clearly trying to differentiate their sound and they do so by experimenting with different sounds in several other tracks PERIOD On My Eyes Schultz surprises listeners by straying away from the familiar melody and shifting the tone in an unexpectedly eerie way PERIOD The result is an intriguing melody that begs to be played again PERIOD

The songs people will love and listen to on repeat though are still the ones that stay true to The Lumineers sound like the aforementioned singles Ophelia and Cleopatra. maybe youll listen to Cleopatra once or twice all the way through  and you should because in truth its a nice album PERIOD

Whether youre a diehard fan or just someone who enjoys hearing one of their hits on the radio in a few years time its guaranteed you will have forgotten about them again assuming a similar drought follows the release of Cleopatra PERIOD

You will again be sipping a coffee in some cute shop somewhere only this time Cleopatra will come on and youllremember just how good The Lumineers are PERIOD

This is because diverse music or not The Lumineers refuse to be forgotten PERIOD
