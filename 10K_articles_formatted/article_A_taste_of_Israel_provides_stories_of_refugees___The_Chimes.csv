Capital Universitys Student Newspaper



In recent weeks many students have probably noticed countless posts focusing on the topic of Syrian refugees while scrolling through their newsfeed PERIOD While citizens are attempting to form opinions on this hot button issue most do not realize there is a whole other group of refugees they have never heard of PERIOD

During the twentieth century about  Jews were expelled from Arab and Muslim countries PERIOD In order to educate students on this topic the Jewish Student Association JSA and Students Support Israel SSI teamed up with Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa JIMENA for an event called A Taste of Israel PERIOD

This event held on Monday Nov PERIOD  included a video two guest speakers food from Caf Istanbul and free merchandise PERIOD

Austin Reid JSA president said that the aim of A Taste of Israel was to give students a better understanding of Jewish refugees PERIOD

When planning this I knew a lot of students here had never heard of this issue before Reid said PERIOD I think it is a tragedy that this entire community was practically destroyed and it was never really talked about. the video titled The Forgotten Refugees gave a brief history of the troubles refugees faced during the twentieth century PERIOD It highlighted the struggles Jews faced while they were living in Arab and Muslim countries PERIOD They were considered second class citizens and faced intimidation harassment beatings rape and even death PERIOD

The criminalization of the Jews and the ensued violence led to an exodus PERIOD Some escaped on their own while others were forced out by the government PERIOD

Refugee camps in Israel provided a safe haven for most of those who left their homes PERIOD While these camps were far from glamorous they provided Jews with safety and independence PERIOD

After the video attendees were introduced to two inspiring women who shared their personal and family stories PERIOD

I always think it is super important to put a human face to stories like this Reid said PERIOD I think that makes people realize how important it is

Jackie a refugee from Iran spoke about her journey PERIOD She had a good education was married had a child and several Muslim friends PERIOD However because she was a Jew Jackie was considered impure by many despite all she had accomplished PERIOD

Conflicts began to rise and attacks started to erupt PERIOD Both Jackies father and husband became very ill PERIOD Due to tensions in Iran nobody was willing to come to the aid of her ailing family members and she was not allowed to leave to country to get help PERIOD

Jackie was told she could not leave because the government did not want her to go to Israel PERIOD They figured that if she took her young son to Israel he would grow up to become a soldier and come back to fight Iran PERIOD

Eventually Jackie made her way out of her country PERIOD She has now been in the United States for  years PERIOD She is happy to have survived and be here today PERIOD However while holding back tears she reminded the audience that she left behind many memories PERIOD

Shirley is a US citizen and the grandchild of an Israeli refugee with a powerful family story PERIOD
Her fathers ancestry was a combination of Spanish Jews and Eastern Jews PERIOD Her grandmother lived in Egypt and studied to be a lab technician in the 1930s PERIOD

Her family hid their Judaism while living in Egypt PERIOD They chose to only practiceJudaism at home because of the harsh penalties faced by Jews during the time PERIOD In  many close friends of Shirleys family were thrown in jail interrogated and even killed PERIOD

Shirleys family was then expelled from Egypt PERIOD They received a oneway stamp on their passport and were only permitted to take one suitcase with them PERIOD They were not allowed to take jewelry PERIOD Her grandmother was forced to leave her engagement ring behind PERIOD

It was not until much later that a friend of the family has smuggled the ring into England and got it back to Shirleys family PERIOD Due to this Shirley was able to wear this ring when she got married PERIOD She said it is one of the only items passed down to her from her family due to the expulsion PERIOD

Shirleys grandfather on her mothers side experienced a pogrom or a violent riot aimed at massacre of Jews when he was a young boy PERIOD He hid under a family members skirt to survive PERIOD A civil war erupted in the 1950s and her grandfather left Algeria for Israel PERIOD He never spoke Arabic again because of the connection it had to the violence he faced in his earlier life PERIOD

Growing up Shirley was exposed to stories PERIOD She emphasized to the group that these stories are not unique to the situations Jews faced PERIOD In fact she said her family was quite lucky considering the experiences many others had during that time PERIOD

Students in attendance were interested in hearing these firsthand accounts PERIOD

I really appreciated the two guest speakers for sharing their intimate family stories with us Sam Morgan a computer science student said PERIOD It helps people understand these crimes and what it means to be a refugee so much more when there is a face and story behind the word. despite all of the hate they and their loved ones have experienced due to their beliefs both Jackie and Shirley are proud to be Jewish PERIOD

It is nothing to be ashamed of Jackie said PERIOD We are good people. both women are also happy to share these stories with college students PERIOD

I think it is very important to talk to young people because they are the next generation thats going to vote and make political decisions Shirley said PERIOD In order to do that you need to know these stories and have the full picture. students are here to become a better human being and gain more knowledge said Jackie PERIOD More knowledge comes with knowing all different kinds of people and that is important. view all posts
