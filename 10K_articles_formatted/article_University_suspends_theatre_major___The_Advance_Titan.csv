Max Rinn Staff WriterApril  

UW Oshkosh students are temporarily suspended from declaring a major in theatre due to low enrollment UWO Provost John Koker said in an interview PERIOD

There are very few students in the major Koker said PERIOD Theres not enough students to populate a class. according to public records for the  academic year  students declared theater as their major and eight people declared it as their minor during the fall  semester compared to  students in the major and  minors for the spring  semester PERIOD

A FOI request was made for emails associated with eliminating or cutting of the theater major andor minor between deans and associate deans of the College of Letters and Science and Jane PurseWiedenhoeft chair of the Department of Theater PERIOD But UWO public records custodian Elizabeth Hartman said there were no records that were responsive to the reporters request PERIOD

Koker said there are multiple reasons the theater department is declining in enrollment PERIOD

Does the problem start with marketing Do they need to redesign the program Koker said PERIOD

However I think most students are choosing to participate in theater as kind of an outside activity of their academic program. koker said incoming students are opting for other majors PERIOD

Right now theatre is not a major our students are selecting Koker said PERIOD Many students go over there for auditions but theyre choosing either radioTVfilm or another major they want to consider. koker said that because he isnt entirely sure why more students arent enrolling in the major he temporarily suspended new students from declaring it as their major PERIOD

The temporary suspension is meant for the department to develop a longterm plan Koker said PERIOD Its to hope that they make changes for recruiting students to change their major drop their major if they choose to and focus on merging their minor with another program. although the suspension is temporary the department has limited time to make improvements before it is eliminated PERIOD

They have one year to come up with a plan Koker said PERIOD If the department can make its final decision within one academic year I will unsuspend students from being able to declare the major. wiedenhoeft declined to comment on the suspension at this time but she said that the production season and students currently enrolled are unaffected PERIOD

Current theatre majors are not affected by this Wiedenhoeft said PERIOD Also current theater minors are not affected by this as well as certificates in which courses are included. thirdyear theatre student Kyle Klein said hes worried the temporary suspension will affect his education going forward PERIOD

Im now stressing about class availability more than in past semesters Klein said PERIOD After speaking with faculty its been made clear that classes needed for the major are not going to be offered for at least two more academic years or possibly never be offered again. klein said that not having the right classes available to him could push back his graduation date PERIOD

This puts me in a very complicated place with the hopes I can graduate by fall   in question now Klein said PERIOD

Thirdyear theatre student Jordan Whitrock said he wants to see changes in how the department is promoted PERIOD

I would like to see more engagement within the university in helping figure out the problem Whitrock said PERIOD I think there has not been much marketing help from the university which adds difficulty. whitrock said that the suspension makes it difficult for the program to grow PERIOD

It is hard to grow a major if you cant offer it to new students Whitrock said PERIOD With a liberal arts college it would be weird to have there not be a theater department. editors Note A caption and the headline were changed to reflect that only theater majors are impacted by Kokers decision PERIOD In addition the FOI request information was modified to make it clear that the records requested did not exist the public records custodian did not decline to provide the emails as first reported PERIOD
