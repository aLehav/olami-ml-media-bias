Cole Kelly of Arkansas scrambled for a touchdown late in the second quarter PERIOD

In their loss to Texas AM Arkansas moves to a  record with some hardhitting teams still left to face PERIOD

Even with the losses and challenges the Razorbacks seem to be experiencing both coaches and players are keeping their spirits high and their expectations even higher PERIOD

Arkansas head coach Chad Morris entered his press conference with a smile and positive outlook PERIOD Despite having just endured a  loss against AM in the Southwest Classic held at ATT stadium PERIOD

I cannot be more proud of the players in that locker room the coaches in that locker room and their fight Morris said PERIOD These guys have continued to show up every day and continue to hit that tree in the same spot PERIOD As I shared with them in that locker room if youll continue to do that its going to fall PERIOD Its going to fall. the idea of teamwork and sticking to the game plan coursed through the team PERIOD Senior linebacker Dre Greenlaw talked about his close relationship with junior linebacker DeJon Harris PERIOD Greenlaw said working with Harris benefits them individually as well as the entire team PERIOD

We go to work every day and we push each other to get better every day Greenlaw said PERIOD At the end of the day we got a mark to make here at Arkansas and we want to be the best PERIOD Were not going to stop until were the best. arkansas had several opportunities to take the lead from AM but wasnt able to get all the pieces moving PERIOD The Razorbacks however didnt back down after going scoreless and down  points in the second quarter PERIOD

Both sophomore quarterback Cole Kelley and junior quarterback Ty Storey each added touchdowns giving the team that extra push and getting them within one touchdown from the Aggies PERIOD

With almost two minutes left in the game the Razorbacks remained at their own 45yard line with only a few more changes to score PERIOD Arkansas was unable to get down the field after an interception by AMs defensive back Donovan Wilson PERIOD

Down by  the ball in your hands PERIOD And we can control PERIOD We pick up first downs PERIOD I think its the only thing in my mind was were fixing to go tie this thing up or give us a chance to win it with a 2point conversion Morris said PERIOD ...And so I thought thatI definitely thought that. heading home to face No PERIOD  Alabama is no small feat for Arkansas PERIOD But the team is remaining confident and making it known that whether they win or not they are always improving PERIOD

Anytime you play Alabama its going to be tough PERIOD They got great players PERIOD We just have to go play Greenlaw said PERIOD At the end of the day the majority of people will have us to lose which is fine PERIOD We dont expect everybody to think we are going to win but the people in the locker room are going to play and fight for each other PERIOD If we do that then well have a chance. the  edition of the Southwest Classic was yet another close game between Texas AM and Arkansas PERIOD The Aggies sealed the  win over
