631,1970-01-01,"frannie Crouse  attempts a shot on goal around Illinois goalkeeper Claire Wheatley  during the game at Jeffrey Field on September   PERIOD Penn State won  PERIOD

On a night where most people are wrapped in blankets and sipping hot chocolate Penn State was taking on UConn in the second round of the NCAA tournament PERIOD

The onfield temperature at game time read a frigid  degrees but that could not slow down the Nittany Lions offense as they defeated the Huskies  PERIOD

In the seventh minute of the match a deep cross from Kori Chapic found its way into the box bounced once on the frozen turf and found the head of Frannie Crouse PERIOD

If there was any hesitation on the side of Crouse the play could have been a simple save for the keeper as she looked to be inches away from snatching the ball out of the air PERIOD

When Chapic has the ball you never know whats really going to happen Crouse said PERIOD I went up for it and thankfully I got to it first. coach Len Tsantiris thought that there would be multiple goals but Crouses score proved his theory to be incorrect PERIOD

We lost the ball for a second Tsantiris said PERIOD It was an opportunity and they took it out of a half of a chance and they got the goal PERIOD That changed the game. at the  mark the ball crossed the line  the only goal of the night PERIOD

It followed a typical Penn State soccer match pattern of getting ahead of the opponent early in the game and keeping an aggressive mindset throughout the rest of the competition PERIOD

The Lions did not take their foot off the gas pedal firing off  more shots in the direction of the UConn goal PERIOD

The game could have been a blowout for the blue and white as missed offensive chances would have sealed the victory long before the final whistle PERIOD

Coach Erica Walsh was happy with the teams effort and acknowledged the defensive prowess of the Huskies which kept the game close PERIOD

We created I felt enough chances to get a second but against a good defense you have to be great Walsh said PERIOD Hopefully the offense players were just saving a few for maybe Sunday. at the end of the night it didnt matter how many times the offense put the ball in the net PERIOD All that mattered is that keeper Britt Eckerstrom and the Lions defense didnt allow the ball to get into their goal PERIOD

Eckerstrom tallied her eighth shutout of the season saving all five shots that came her way PERIOD

Even though she gets the statistic next to her name she credited her defensive unit PERIOD

Were just so connected right now just one back line Eckerstrom said PERIOD Im pumped for them PERIOD They played really well today. the Huskies defense played almost as well tonight but it wasnt enough causing the team to take the long ride home PERIOD

Tsantiris spoke softly after the defeat and told it how it is PERIOD

Only one team is going to be happy out of the  Tsantiris said PERIOD Thats the way it goes PERIOD So it was our time to be out. penn State moves on to the round of  and will take on Virginia Techon Sunday at  p.m PERIOD at Jeffrey Field PERIOD
