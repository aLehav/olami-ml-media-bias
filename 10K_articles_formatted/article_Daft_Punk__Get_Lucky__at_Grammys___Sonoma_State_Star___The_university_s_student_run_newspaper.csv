9344,2014-01-28,"the fifty-sixth Annual Grammy Awards aired last Sunday on CBS and a pair of robots from France took home both Record of the Year and Album of the Year PERIOD

The competition leading up to the Grammys was fierce with JayZ receiving nine nominations and Kendrick Lamar Macklemore  Ryan Lewis Justin Timberlake and Pharrell Williams all tied for seven PERIOD

Right out the gate power couple JayZ and Beyonc performed Drunk in Love in front of a packed house with Beyonc looking quite fierce for a mom who just gave birth a mere two years ago PERIOD

The performances were starstudded and actionpacked throughout the evening with some fascinating musical pairings from the most unexpected of artists PERIOD

While awards were given out between the songsit is an awards show after allit felt like  percent of the Grammy Awards were given out earlier in the day with the most popular of categories being reserved for primetime PERIOD

This could be confusing for viewers at home for when certain artists were mentioned the presenters would casually mention the artist in question had already won a Grammy for a not mentioned category earlier in that day ultimately making us muggles who arent involved in the music industry feel out of the loop PERIOD

Lorde Ella Maria Lani YelichOConnor won Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for her hit song Royals. the 17yearold New Zealander performed an eerie rendition of the song earlier in the show PERIOD

Macklemore  Ryan Lewis won Best New Artist Best Rap Album The Heist Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance for the single Thrift Shop. macklemore later went to Instagram to apologize to Kendrick Lamar for robbing him of the Best Rap Album Grammy PERIOD

You got robbed PERIOD I wanted you to win PERIOD You should have PERIOD Its weird and it sucks that I robbed you Macklemore wrote PERIOD Perhaps Lamar can find an old Grammy the next time he visits a thrift shop PERIOD

The real winners last night were Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams PERIOD Williams had a thumb in every pie in  and because of it won Producer of the Year for his collaborations with Daft Punk Robin Thicke JayZ and Frank Ocean PERIOD

Both Williams and Daft Punk went home with Record of the Year Get Lucky Album of the Year Random Access Memories and Best Pop DuoGroup Performance PERIOD Daft Punk also won Grammys in the Best DanceElectronica Album and Best Engineered Album  NonClassical categories PERIOD

It was an emotional moment for the robotic duo Thomas Bangalter and GuyManuel de HomemChristo upon winning Album of the Year as they hugged for a good  seconds in their Stormtrooperesque outfits proving they were human after all PERIOD

Despite many artists being nominated for multiple categories not all of them went home with arms filled with the coveted golden gramophone PERIOD Compton rapper Lamar didnt win a single award that night PERIOD

While some artists performed solo or with their groups it was the mashups that really shook things up PERIOD

Robin Thicke and the legendary Chicago performed a mashup of Saturday in the Park and Blurred Lines while Kendrick Lamar and Imagine Dragons had an awkward and bizarre rendition of Radioactive mixed with M.A.A.D PERIOD City. pink dazzled the audience with another acrobatic ribbon twirling performance that took place high above the crowd while she simultaneously sang Try before coming down and performing Just Give Me a Reason with fun.s Nate Ruess PERIOD

ExBeatles Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney reunited on stage for Queenie Eye a new single off McCartneys New album PERIOD

Daft Punk Nile Rodgers Pharrell Williams and Stevie Wonder performed Get Lucky with a little bit of Le Freak and Harder Better Faster Stronger mixedin proving to be one of the more entertaining performances of the evening PERIOD

One of the final big performances of the evening turned out to be one of the most controversial PERIOD

Macklemore  Ryan Lewis performed Same Love and halfway through Queen Latifah came out and married  gay and straight couples in the audience as Madonna sang the chorus of Open Your Heart while wearing an outfit usually seen on Colonel Sanders PERIOD

Overall the Grammys definitely provided some quality performances and surprising wins this year but in the end Daft Punk brought life back to music and showed that they were harder better faster stronger around the world one more time PERIOD
