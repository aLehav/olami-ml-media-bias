WILMINGTON Dela PERIOD  As the final quarter of basketball came to a close the Massachusetts womens basketball team saw its hot shooting start rewarded with a substantial  win over Saint Josephs   Atlantic  in the quarterfinals of the Atlantic  conference tournament PERIOD Enjoying the fruits of their labor the homestretch was chockfull of fun basketball PERIOD

Makennah White was all smiles in the final minutes PERIOD She was UMass   A10 main and only source of points off the bench posting  points on an efficient 5of6 shooting and tallied four rebounds and two assists across  minutes of game action PERIOD With  seconds left White spun around and swished a fadeaway jump shot at the top of the key to get the UMass bench and the entire Chase Fieldhouse on its feet for the victory celebration PERIOD

Of Whites four rebounds three were collected on the offensive end PERIOD A minute into the second quarter White rose to grab a missed 3pointer and punched home the put back shot shrugging off two defenders who tried to get in her way PERIOD The second effort increased the Minutewomen lead to seven and were two of the teams nine second chance points PERIOD

White was great Sydney Taylor said PERIOD She always comes in with a ton of energy that we feed off of PERIOD Her impact her defense her rebounding PERIOD It was amazing and it helped us win today. with Taylor getting into early foul trouble she remained scoreless in the first half PERIOD White stepped up and was able to hold down the fort just long enough for Taylors 20point resurgence in the second half PERIOD When Taylor got hot late White fed the hot hand which led to a strong driving layup for Taylor to extend the lead to  PERIOD

Standing at 6feet2inches sophomore White is equipped with a versatile defensive skillset and is more than capable of holding her own while guarding smaller players PERIOD While most post players would find themselves in mismatch situations when defending a guard White stands her ground and does the dirty work PERIOD

We were switching off screens and White does a great job of sitting down in a stance and defending guards head coach Tory Verdi PERIOD We wanted to match Saint Josephs physicality PERIOD I thought that Saint Josephs was really trying to throw Talya Brugler the ball and also Laila Fair. last time these two teams faced off it was a lopsided  victory in favor of the Minutewomen PERIOD The Hawks frontcourt in Brugler and Fair combined for  points PERIOD On Saturday Fair paced her team with  points to go along with five rebounds and three blocks while Brugler was close behind with  points while also racking up nine rebounds in a near doubledouble PERIOD

Whites ability to adapt to whatever circumstance Saint Josephs threw at UMass was a crucial component to the teams win today and was in large part the reason why Verdi gave White more minutes over the teams starting power forward Angelique Ngalakulondi PERIOD

White is a lot more physical than Ngalakulondi Verdi said PERIOD We wanted that PERIOD We wanted her energy as well PERIOD Its coupled with her energy her want to her communication and her defense PERIOD Thats what kept her out here today and she did a fabulous job here today for us. whites deceptively quick for her height but she also has the strength to set brick wall screens on opponents and create open opportunity shots for her teammates PERIOD

Shes always doing whatever she can Sam Breen said PERIOD I know she tried to take a charge PERIOD Shes trying to do the little things which always helps PERIOD Calling double calling single when I have it in the post and shes doing all the little things that really help PERIOD She was finishing really well today. uMass advances to the championship game of the A10 tournament where it will face the No PERIOD  seeded Dayton Flyers Sunday at  p.m PERIOD
