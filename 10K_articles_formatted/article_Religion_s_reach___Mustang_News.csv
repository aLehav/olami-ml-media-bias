Beyond getting an education many Cal Poly students seek more theyre searching for their next spiritual fix PERIOD  Maybe its the weekly Bible study meeting or monthly Shabbat dinner or giving thanks to God before eating dinner PERIOD  Religion  or lack thereof  affects students lives every day so the Mustang Daily decided to find out just how much PERIOD

Does religion actually influence students drinking and smoking habits How often do they attend religious services off campus And how big a factor does religion play in controversial issues like abortion and stem cell research

Despite the publicity for religious organizations on campus the Mustang Daily was stunned to find in a survey it conducted of nearly  students that  percent arent involved at all in religious clubs at Cal Poly PERIOD  Moreover only  percent attend religious services off campus PERIOD

But the Mustang Daily wanted to find out more than just statistics from surveys and decided to interview students of different religious backgrounds as well PERIOD In this issue youll see what its really like for students who are Hindu Buddhist Jewish Christian Muslim and more PERIOD On the flip side we check in with students who are atheist and agnostic to see what values they stick by without a religious direction PERIOD

All statistics in this issue were based off a Mustang Daily survey that was handed out randomly to  students and had roughly a  percent margin of error PERIOD  In addition because not all students were surveyed or interviewed it was impossible to quantify all the religions present on campus PERIOD
