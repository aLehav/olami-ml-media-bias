9976,2010-04-02,"its April the daffodils are blooming and admitted students are touring the Washington University campus PERIOD In the last few weeks I have seen enough incoming freshmen to make me wonder whether the class of  has already taken up residence on the South  PERIOD But they havent yet PERIOD In fact many high school seniors are still going through the same nervewracking admission waitlist and rejection process that the class of  went through a year ago PERIOD For many of my peers and me this was the first time we had to deal with goals we could not reach and rejection was very difficult to handle PERIOD

Rejection in any form is tough regardless of its scale PERIOD As young adults entering the real world students must realize that rejection is inevitable PERIOD Everyone will face disappointment and rejections will follow us throughout our adult lives PERIOD

Being in college has been much more difficult than it was to get into college PERIOD I have tried harder in the past year than I ever have before and yet have still faced more disappointments than at any other point in my life PERIOD The disappointments I have faced however have forced me to grow up PERIOD I now know from personal experience that circumstances will not always unfold as I want or intend them to PERIOD

Ultimately an individuals behavior in the face of such rejection is far more indicative of his or her character than behavior in times of success PERIOD By now I have learned the allimportant art of how to accept such disappointments and bow out of a situation with dignity PERIOD

If treated appropriately the experience of facing a disappointment can make us more mature individuals PERIOD As a new freshman I would call home and pout anytime I was having a difficult moment but I realized over time that this is neither a practical nor a productive modus operandi PERIOD Life does not get any easier but rather more difficult and if you are pushing yourself to bigger and better goals unfortunately you are bound to face more rejections along the way PERIOD

While rejection is certainly an effective remedy for bravado there is a fine line between learning humility and losing your selfesteem PERIOD When confronted with the challenges of college academics and social life students must remember that often the demands they place on themselves are simply unreasonable PERIOD An individual is not challenging him or herself enough if he or she can reach every goal PERIOD

As the popular adage goes It is better to have tried and failed than to never have tried at all indicating that sometimes what we learn from failure is more important in the long run than the actual failure itself PERIOD Like any other human being we arent required to succeed every time PERIOD

While I have heard stories about highly successful people pasting their rejection letters on walls to motivate themselves I find it depressing to spend too much time dwelling on shortcomings PERIOD We should of course try to negate our flaws but excessive time spent fretting about past failures can close our eyes to new opportunities that are opening before us PERIOD

Foremost we should always remain optimistic about future prospects PERIOD This is particularly important to remember at a time when national rates of depression and suicide among college students are on the rise PERIOD Rejection and perceived failure may seem catastrophic in the short term but time is a magician with a little perspective PERIOD
