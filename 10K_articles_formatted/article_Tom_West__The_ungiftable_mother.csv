One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

Since before I was born when it was only my sisters in the house my mom has always asked for peace and harmony every year for Christmas PERIOD This year we got her a CrockPot PERIOD

I screw up gifts for my mom all the time PERIOD It started in the second grade when my teacher assigned us each the project of picking out gifts for our parents from a box of festive trinkets PERIOD Shed ordered the box from Oriental Trading PERIOD She sent us home with a worksheet with spaces for what our family wanted PERIOD On it were question prompts in case we blanked during the interview PERIOD

Mother what is your favorite color I had to ask PERIOD

It seemed silly PERIOD I thought I already knew all there was to know about the strange people who lived in my house and enforced my bedtime which wasnt much PERIOD Im not sure it occurred to me they could have opinions and desires that were not directly related to my person and wellbeing PERIOD

Yellow my mother said PERIOD I love yellow PERIOD Now put on your cleats for soccer practice and no crying this time. so I brought her home a little yellow ornament for the tree PERIOD And that was all the gettingtoknowyou I did with my mother for a very long time until a Christmas in middle school when I bought her a yellow sweater PERIOD I had asked her what she wanted but shed just said peace and harmony per usual PERIOD

She just loved the sweater really I do she said PERIOD Except she didnt PERIOD One of the many reasons giving and getting gifts is a terrible and frightening institution is because of the expressions we have to make while we open them PERIOD Most everyone knows when someone really loves a gift or if theyre just making the face youre supposed to make when you unwrap it PERIOD Oh I just love it theyll say tucking it away in a drawer and quickly patting the handle PERIOD

A few weeks later my mother was walking around the house in a sweater almost exactly like the one I got her except it was periwinkle blue PERIOD I figured shed exchanged it which would be fine PERIOD But she hadnt PERIOD Shed kept the sweater Id gotten her  shed never give that away it was a gift from her son PERIOD She just wanted one in blue because after all Blue is just my favorite color she said PERIOD

It was enough that my parents were allowed to have ideas and opinions not directly related to me PERIOD But to go about changing all the time and acting like real living people was another matter PERIOD Id put in the quality time in the second grade and from then my relationship with the people who lived in my house and enforced my bedtime should have been coasting PERIOD

That night or some night thereafter my sisters and I gathered sub rosa to discuss the matter of our mother who was impossible to pick out gifts for PERIOD I quickly suggested she should be eliminated PERIOD If she were in a coma I said we would only have to visit once a year with flowers like they do on TV. my sisters and I weighed the relative emotional cost of having a mother in a coma or admitting to ourselves that perhaps we didnt know our mother as a person the way we assumed we always had PERIOD After some deliberation it was decided that measure was too drastic but it was put on the backburner as a last resort PERIOD

We decided the easiest way to pick out gifts was to determine what our mother liked to do PERIOD

Cooking my sisters said and cleaning. yes  Good good PERIOD But what about laundry I asked PERIOD

It was decided that in lieu of rubber gloves and laundry detergent for the next Mothers Day wed save up the money go to the Home Depot and buy all the fixings for my mom to start her own garden PERIOD It just seemed like the sort of thing that the sort of person who seemed to like to cook and clean and wash dishes and pick up childrens rooms would like to do  gardening I mean PERIOD Id find out years later that my mom had other interests that didnt involve caring for us that she likes snowshoeing and tennis and apparently used to work for Microsoft whatever that was or meant PERIOD

So that May we plopped a few stacks of wood and some nails and seeds in the yard with a bow on all of it PERIOD Then we patted each other on the back and left our mother to construct it because there was a daytime marathon of Lifetime original movies on and the weather was just awful PERIOD

My mom actually did like that gift PERIOD I think she would have spent a lot of time in the garden had she any time to spare between driving us to and from sports and doing the cooking and cleaning and the laundry that she seemed to love so much PERIOD

So the garden never got built and I think I felt a pang of grief or annoyance PERIOD I just really thought Id finally gotten her bought her off with a garden PERIOD It wouldnt have mattered what it was PERIOD It could have been a Prada bag a Lamborghini a whole circus in the goddamn back yard PERIOD Just so long as I could say that Id done it Id bought you out and you had never really wanted peace and harmony you had wanted

But no PERIOD It struck me that the woman who lived in my house and enforced my bedtime wanted nothing from me PERIOD She had done all shed done out of love a great insurmountable love that I was ashamed I couldnt understand and that I could do nothing in my whole life to repay her PERIOD

Anyways my sisters and I have changed the gift plans a little bit PERIOD In addition to the CrockPot we got her some CrockPot cooking lessons PERIOD I think thats a nice little addition because we spent a little more maybe PERIOD

But the idea of my mother standing in a cooking class with a few people she did not know being taught to cook for her family using a CrockPotbrand crockpot hit me in the stomach like a ton of bricks PERIOD So if all  of my readers can keep a secret Ill tell you that my sisters and I bought the same lessons my mom is going to and my dad is coming too and maybe after a little more quality time spent with her a few years down the road Ill find out what shes really wanted all along PERIOD
