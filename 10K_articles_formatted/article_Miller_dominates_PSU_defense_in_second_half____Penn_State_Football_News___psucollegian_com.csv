Ohio State quarterback Braxton Miller  launches himself into Penn States end zone scoring a touchdown in the third quarter of the game PERIOD The Nittany Lions lost the game  on October   PERIOD

The crowd went wild and music even played for a brief moment at Beaver Stadium when Sean Stanley leveled Carlos Hyde and kept him out of the endzone during a play in the third quarter PERIOD

However there was one problem for Stanley and the Penn State faithful  Hyde didnt have the football PERIOD

The ball was in the hands of quarterback Braxton Miller who kept it on an option read PERIOD Miller then showcased his athleticism on one of the most memorable oneyard runs of the college football season PERIOD He not only fooled Stanley with the fake but juked by linebacker Gerald Hodges before he dived into the endzone on a 3rdandgoal for his first of three secondhalf touchdowns PERIOD

That was crazy Ohio State wideout Jake Stoneburner said of the play PERIOD Ive never seen a quarterback be able to do something like that let alone most athletes PERIOD The sideline was just in just in awe like everyone was covering their mouth eyes wide open PERIOD Ive never seen a play like that from a quarterback. millers feet were the main reason they were able to pull away from Penn State in the second half PERIOD After a relatively quiet first two quarters Miller carried the rock  times in the final  minutes for  yards and two touchdowns PERIOD

He finished with a total of  yards   of which came on the ground PERIOD

I thought we did a pretty good job in the first half but there were some broken plays in the second half junior linebacker Glenn Carson said PERIOD

Millers health was a concern entering the contest PERIOD He banged his head on a tackle the week before against Purdue and was taken to a hospital but he looked fine Saturday PERIOD

The dualthreat quarterback didnt do much with his arm PERIOD He repeatedly missed targets in the first half threw an interception to Adrian Amos on his first pass of the second half and ended the game with just seven completions only three of which came after halftime PERIOD

But Miller didnt have to do much through the air PERIOD Mainly by keeping the ball on option reads the 6foot2 Hubler Heights Ohio product sliced through Penn States defense PERIOD

He can go anywhere linebacker Mike Hull said PERIOD He can take it right up the gut he can bounce it outside PERIOD Hes just a good player. miller threw the ball  times and his biggest completion came on his last pass PERIOD With Ohio State leading by  points in the fourth quarter Miller found Stoneburner down the middle on a third down PERIOD

Stoneburner made a catch over safety Jake Fagnano and took it  yards to the endzone to put an end to any thoughts of a Penn State comeback PERIOD

The Nittany Lions had some success containing other running quarterbacks this season in games against Illinois Temple and Navy but Miller had his way against them PERIOD

Miller now has  rushing yards and  passing yards this season for the undefeated Buckeyes and is in the thick of the Heisman Trophy race PERIOD Coach Bill OBrien called him one of the top five players in the country PERIOD

We stopped him at times and other times we obviously didnt OBrien said PERIOD So we have to go back and watch the tape and see again what we can do better to stop a player like that. to email reporter smp5481psu.edu
