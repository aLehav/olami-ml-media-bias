Having recently moved their way back in the AP top25 there is no doubt the Rams are in conversation as a tournamentbound team PERIOD No PERIOD  VCU has compiled a  record and currently shares honors atop the Atlantic10 conference PERIOD But are they able to compete with the perennial programs in the country The only detriment to VCU compared to the top teams in the country is their lack of size in the frontcourt PERIOD

The absence of big bodies down low can be damaging when playing teams with a dominant big man PERIOD VCUs havoc style of play tends to limit the Rams when it comes to being able to keep a big body in the paint PERIOD In a fastpaced offense the larger players are more vulnerable due to their lack of agility on the perimeter PERIOD

The anchor for the Rams down low resides in 6foot6 forward Mo AlieCox PERIOD The Alexandria Virginia native is a force to be reckoned with in all facets on the defensive side of the game PERIOD Another rising stud is freshman forward Justin Tillman who stands 6foot7 PERIOD

Both Tillman and AlieCox give VCU two physically active big men who play with heart and passion on both ends of the court PERIOD Effort is key for the Rams frontcourt since their lack of size puts them at a disadvantage when playing a team with more size and length PERIOD

University of Virginia and Villanova University both handed VCU early losses this season in part because of their size PERIOD Both schools rank among the top10 teams in the country PERIOD

U.Va PERIOD was able to outrebound VCU  in the 17point loss in which U.Va PERIOD was able to go on a  run and shoot  percent from the floor in the game. the Wahoos frontcourt ranged from 7foot center Mike Tobey to 6foot9 forward Anthony Gill who torched VCU for  points on  shooting PERIOD

Villanova outrebounded VCU  but took control in the second half of the game by dishing the ball down low to their frontcourt and then were able to find shooters on the perimeter PERIOD Villanova compiled  assists as a team a statistic head coach Shaka Smart was not fond of PERIOD

Its unacceptable Smart said PERIOD Its a painful reminder that we need to get better on defense. in basketball the team with the most height always has the advantage PERIOD There is no other team in the country that can match the height of No PERIOD  Kentucky PERIOD

Kentuckys frontcourt ranges from 7foot Willie CauleyStein to 6foot11 Karl Towns PERIOD In comparison to the NBA only the Orlando Magic and Oklahoma City Thunder can match the height of the Kentucky Wildcats PERIOD The clearcut favorites to win the National Championship the Wildcats have both height and length at their disposal PERIOD

For VCU to be able to garnish another Final Four run a physical presence down low must be found by the end of the season PERIOD AlieCox is paired with senior forward Jarred Guest who continues to evolve as a force under the rim PERIOD The presence of Guest will be the key for the Rams as he adds another element into the equation. guest ranges 6foot8 but has the athleticism and foot quickness to guard taller players PERIOD

Guest Tillman and AlieCox lead a defense struggling to make a name for itself. with the bandit himself in senior point guard Briante Weber VCU thrives on averaging the fourth most steals per game with  PERIOD The rest of the defense has not seen as much success as VCU ranks one hundred and eighty-fifth in points allowing . per game and two hundred and seventy-second in rebounds per game with . pERIOD

Luckily for the Rams VCU will not be outsized in the Atlantic  conference but when tournament play comes around the absence of a 7foot stud in the middle could plague VCUs ability to win games PERIOD

To the Rams avail Havoc still presents a daunting task for teams to play against as the country has yet to find an answer to derail head coach Shaka Smarts master scheme PERIOD
