Guia PERIOD It means guide or guidebook in Spanish and its safe to say everyone in my study abroad program brought one to Madrid PERIOD We depended on them the first few days to show us where to eat shop and barhop PERIOD Were still using them for information about the museums and architecture but after a week in the city its starting to hit us that Spain isnt just a vacation  well be living here for four months PERIOD

I feel like a freshman again PERIOD I arrived early in the morning very tired from a long journey PERIOD I was met by a lot of happy energetic people as was treated to a traditional meal PERIOD  We live in apartments with RAs or homestays with a seora PERIOD Were disoriented but in love with seeing new sights PERIOD  Most of us are past the socalled honeymoon stage and are beginning to adjust PERIOD  Much like freshman year its challenging to balance exercising newfound independence with feelings of homesickness PERIOD Classes start Monday PERIOD We spent the last week in conversation orientation classes which was really time for groups of scared American kids to ask a professor how to say important Spanish phrases like How much do these jeans cost and I didnt mean to order the jamn. the Spanish timetable is very appealing to a college student PERIOD In the morning you roll out of bed and have a breakfast of thick hot chocolate and a fried churro PERIOD Lunch is huge laidback and also late in the day around  or  p.m PERIOD It can also be followed by a nice nap or siesta PERIOD Dinner doesnt really matter because you ate so much at lunch but if youre hungry you can wash down your evening drinks with tapas which basically means ordering several appetizers of seafood meats and cheeses PERIOD Tapas barhopping lasts a few hours until the real bars open PERIOD After the bars close partiers migrate to the discos PERIOD Rather than pay for a cab home most wait until the Metro opens again at  a.m PERIOD  Nap shower repeat  youre a Spaniard

Sleep is a confusing thing  I dont think Spaniards get any PERIOD I didnt sleep until my roommate and I switched to a room without an exterior wall PERIOD Turns out that the bar below my window attracts a lively crowd most Thursdays Fridays Saturdays Sundays and Mondays PERIOD Falling asleep to music is nice but four drunk Spanish women singing Ricky Martin at the top of their lungs at  a.m PERIOD could wake me out of a Nyquil coma  believe me I tried everything PERIOD

In between the hours spent trying to sleep and those wishing I were asleep Ive been able to see some great things PERIOD Come to Spain in January or February and youre sure to see rebajas everywhere PERIOD Stores get rid of their fallwinter collections for prices you wouldnt even find at WalMart PERIOD  Ive visited Plaza Mayor and the Prado Museum and even witnessed a parade of intoxicated Cadiz soccer fans march to the Stadium Santiago Bernabeu for a Real Madrid game PERIOD

The language can be frustrating especially since the Spanish have acquired a nice lisp that can divert attention away from the words in the sentence PERIOD

Culinary dishes are centered around seafood or meat the most prevalent being jamn or ham PERIOD Jamn seems to creep into everything including Lays potato chips PERIOD Without a seora to cook for us weve been living off spaghetti and bagged salad PERIOD

After two weeks were still not over being without very American things like peanut butter and 24hour Internet access PERIOD But dont worry  we will survive PERIOD Sometimes when we sit by the window in our apartment we can pick up a faint wireless signal PERIOD

We have a few cookbooks and found a fresh market down the street PERIOD The owner of the creperie around the corner gives us sangria on the house PERIOD And we made friends with the owners of the everythingunderaEuro store PERIOD For us these connections are as exciting as finding your favorite Chinese restaurant in Rochester or knowing how to take the bus to the mall and Wegmans PERIOD

Were starting over but were quickly settling into our city our neighborhood and our home PERIOD I realize this has been a mishmash of observations and emotions but at this point the mishmash describes everything perfectly PERIOD Two weeks abroad is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of time and experience PERIOD Its too early to sort everything into neat little boxes or label an experience as a defining moment. im lucky to spend the semester in a great city  excellent shopping rich culture abundant nightlife and of course enough jamn to feed the world PERIOD Defining moments will emerge sooner or later and I cant wait PERIOD",Student experiences life abroad - Campus Times,University of Rochester
