Opening sixth weekend is The Effect of Gamma Rays on ManintheMoon Marigolds by Paul Zindel  directed by Jacobsen PERIOD The play focuses on a dysfunctional family consisting of single mother Beatrice and her two daughters Ruth and Tillie PERIOD Though there are moments of humor overall The Effect of Gamma Rays on ManintheMoon Marigolds is gritty and rough PERIOD Jacobsen is thrilled to have found what she describes as a powerhouse cast to pull off this complicated play with challenging female roles PERIOD

Performed back to back opening eighth weekend and directed by Jane Kelly are two one act plays by George Bernard Shaw Dark Lady of the Sonnets  and Man of Destiny  PERIOD Though Kelly acknowledges that at the center of each play are to put it in her words dead white men the former Shakespeare and the latter Napoleon she maintains that complex female characters are what make these two plays compelling PERIOD Although Shaw is well known for his humorous writing which is present in both of these one acts he also incorporates fantastic moments of ingenuity and sensitivity in his work PERIOD If you enjoy social commentary Shakespeare jokes and mockery of the English language this is the show for you PERIOD

Circle Mirror Transformation by Annie Baker  will open ninth weekend and is being directed by Alexa Blasnek  and Ceci Hart  PERIOD Circle Mirror Transformation is about an adult acting class at a community center PERIOD In this play the audience learns about each character through formal theater exercises PERIOD Hart described Circle Mirror Transformation as very meta and says that she and Baker are excited to make creative artistic choices in directing this unique piece PERIOD
