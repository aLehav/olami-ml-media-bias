Mike Gotimer  Monday March  

When senior guard Ben Hansbrough fouled out with over eight minutes remaining in the game No PERIOD  Notre Dame found itself in the unenviable position of pulling out a road win against a ranked opponent on its senior night without its top player PERIOD

The Irish however held off a Connecticut surge and left the Gampel Pavilion with a   Notre Dames first win ever on Connecticuts campus PERIOD

After squandering a 10point lead the Irish   Big East finished the game on a  run in the final four minutes to earn a crucial road win that bolsters Notre Dames already impressive NCAA tournament resume PERIOD Despite the run the game was in doubt right down to the final possession when Connecticut senior guard Donnell Beverly fumbled away a pass from junior guard Kemba Walker as time expired PERIOD On the Huskies previous possession Walker missed a threepointer that would have given Connecticut the lead PERIOD

Following the win Irish coach Mike Brey was beaming with pride over his teams gutty performance PERIOD

Couldnt be more proud of our group Brey said in his postgame radio show PERIOD Obviously we lose Ben with  minutes left but our nucleus of other guys just played so well PERIOD It was almost a little like former Irish player Luke Harangody being out last year PERIOD A good player is gone and others just step forward PERIOD I thought we really defended well outside of our zone in the last four minutes to get us out of there alive. the Irish held an 8point lead with  remaining in the game when Hansbrough picked up his fourth foul of the game PERIOD Notre Dame held off the Huskies   for the next three and a half minutes opening up a 10point lead on a threepointer from senior forward Carleton Scott PERIOD Walker hit two free throws at the other end but sophomore forward Jack Cooley gave Notre Dame a  lead with just under ten minutes to go in the game PERIOD A minute and a half later however Hansbrough picked up his fifth foul with  left in the game just ten seconds after checking into the game for the final time PERIOD The foul sent the home crowd into a frenzy and shifted the momentum in the Huskies favor as they went on a  run to take the lead with  of those points coming after Hansbroughs departure PERIOD Walker who finished with  points in the game scored  points in the Connecticut run PERIOD

Just because the crowd was going and Ben was out we still had a chance to win the game Brey said PERIOD I told them that it was just like the Peterson Center in Pittsburgh PERIOD We were at the same striking distance down two possessions with four minutes to go and I said Lets just play PERIOD Relax. we tried to put some pressure on them and see if they could finish and our guys did a really good job of that and different guys stepped up. the Irish battled back with scores from seniors Tim Abromaitis Scott Martin and Tyrone Nash who had  points and an assist in Notre Dames winning rally and finished with  points on the day PERIOD

Following the win Hansbrough who scored  points in  minutes was named first team allconference on Sunday while Abromaitis was named to the third team PERIOD Hansbrough was the only unanimous selection to the first team PERIOD

With the regular season complete the Irish will head to New York this week for the Big East Tournament PERIOD As the No PERIOD  seed the Irish earned a doublebye in the tournament and will play their first game Thursday PERIOD
