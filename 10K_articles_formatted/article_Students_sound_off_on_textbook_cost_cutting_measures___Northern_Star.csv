Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Liz StoeverAugust  

With the skyrocketing prices of textbooks some college students are opting to purchase their books online PERIOD

The Internet has become an integral part of many college students lives and some have decided to rely on the Internet instead of bookstores PERIOD

Junior finance major Kim Bell said www.ecampus.com is an option she prefers to use while shopping for inexpensive textbooks PERIOD

Its kind of like WalMart sometimes you find stuff cheaper sometimes you dont she said PERIOD

Bell believes finding cheaper books is worth the searching and comparing PERIOD

Only if shipping is free otherwise youre paying the same thing Bell said PERIOD

Some students pay for their textbooks out of pocket and thus prefer to search around for the best deal PERIOD

In some cases that means waiting until the last minute to buy books so they can avoid buying books that their professors may not require PERIOD

Senior finance major Tom Schlink believes buying textbooks online can be cheaper but not always the most convenient PERIOD

You have to wait for shipping PERIOD Sometimes they lose your orders that actually happened to me last year PERIOD I had to wait two more weeks Schlink said PERIOD

Schlink said the Village Commons Bookstore is the best resource for getting books because of the stores wide selection PERIOD

Furthermore some students believe there is a lot of inconvenience involved with buying books online and do not opt for that method PERIOD

I dont have time said junior math education major Paul Okimoto PERIOD I get books in between classes. other students take textbook buying and selling into their own hands PERIOD Bell said she sells her books and negotiates for the best price PERIOD

Okimoto said he does not sell his textbooks to other students PERIOD However he and his friend are sharing a math textbook to save money PERIOD

Lee Blankenship the manager for VCB does not see online prices as a large threat that can lower sales PERIOD

Weve been hearing about online books for over  years Blankenship said PERIOD Convenience is a large factor PERIOD Sometimes you get a deal online sometimes you dont. advertisement
