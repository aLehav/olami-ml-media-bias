I told my friend I was going to write about religion and she said Youd better get ready for the hate mail. i told her she was wrong because anyone reading this piece is most likely wellinformed welleducated and open to the viewpoints of others PERIOD



Then I thought about it for nearly a full minute and decided that I really didnt want to start an argument between the believers and freethinkers that would inevitably create a heated debate with the freethinkers making their point and leaving the discussion and then spiral downward even further with the believers accusing each other of gross misinterpretations of the scriptures PERIOD

I needed a new idea so I scrolled through my email to search for a topic and to my surprise the IRS had sent me a message to let me know that I was going to receive a  refund PERIOD

Unfortunately to claim it I would be required to purchase a sixmonth supply of Viagra PERIOD As the depression set in I continued to scroll down and saw an RSS feed from The DEN PERIOD Apparently the Electronic Writing Portfolio had been explained and clarified in a forum on Tuesday PERIOD

Depression cured

What exciting news this was because Ive been trying to understand the purpose of this program since I first enrolled here PERIOD

I asked my friends at other universities around the country if they knew anything about the EWP PERIOD Most of them laughed and said theyd never heard of such a program PERIOD I asked my professors what the EWP was and the best answer I got beyond I dont know was I dont know just do it so you can check the block and graduate. no problem PERIOD

From the beginning the EWP has somehow reminded me of the young lieutenants in the Army that would come up with a clever acronym or slogan to implement a program to improve safety PERIOD

The Army had been promoting the slogan Safety First since World War II PERIOD The new lieutenant comes up with Put Safety First. theres no change in the intent of the message the only thing it served was to justify giving the lieutenant a high mark on his annual evaluation report PERIOD

Thats exactly what this EWP program seems like  a program set up to justify someones evaluation position or paycheck PERIOD We already have a program in place to evaluate students writing  class grades PERIOD

Maybe its set up for its exact intended purposes that would be a surprise PERIOD

Maybe its set up to evaluate the professors ability to evaluate good writing that would be a slap in the face and not a surprise PERIOD

Maybe its for some other reason completely PERIOD

I dont know PERIOD I dont care PERIOD

What I do know is Ive submitted mine so I can Check the block and graduate. sam Slaven is a senior geography major PERIOD He can be reached at  or at emailprotected PERIOD
