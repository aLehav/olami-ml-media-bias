Landon Nichols grew up learning a faithbased version of sex education in his Selma private school where students were taught an abstinenceonly curriculum in a program covertly called CHANGES. nichols recalled an exercise where one student was instructed to stand on the floor while another was supposed to stand on a desk with the goal being to pull each other in their own direction PERIOD

The whole point of the exercise was that its a lot easier to get pulled down by bad influences than to be pulled up by good ones so you shouldnt surround yourself with people who have sex young he said stifling a laugh PERIOD I just remember that being striking and it just stands out to me because its such an oversimplification. the exercise was just one example of what Nichols called a wildly disparate sexed curriculum throughout the state of Alabama in which some students receive no sexual education some like him get an abstinenceonly version PERIOD

It totally depends on your zip code he said PERIOD It depends on your school district and it depends on your individual educator. thirtyeight percent of all high schools and  of middle schools in the United States provide all  topics identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC as critical sex education topics PERIOD

Nichols a UA alumnus works for Medical Advocacy and Outreach MAO a Ryan Whitefunded HIVAIDS service organization in Montgomery PERIOD MAO advocates for sexual health in  Alabama counties essentially covering the entire Black Belt and Wiregrass regions PERIOD The sex education bill is at the top of their legislative agenda PERIOD

The new bill called the Alabama Youth Health Protection Act does not mandate teaching sex education or a particular curriculum and it doesnt promote sexual activity or teach sexual techniques PERIOD Rather it seeks to combat medically inaccurate and homophobic language in the current law PERIOD This means that the current law should reflect uptodate federally compliant language which would require terms like STD and AIDS to be changed to STI and HIV Nichols said as well as striking out derogatory language about homosexual conduct. it gives administrators and teachers guidance in what is allowed under the law he said PERIOD There are a lot of misconceptions about what the law does and does not allow PERIOD We believe that by clearing up some of the language there will be more educators who feel comfortable bringing forth sex education curriculum. this is the fourth year a similar bill has been introduced in the state legislature and the second year in a row that a bill of its exact form has been introduced PERIOD Last year the bill passed a full Senate with only one dissenting vote and the same bill thats being introduced this year was passed by the House education committee last year PERIOD

Really the impetus for this bill was students asking their administrators and their teachers in the schools for sex ed Nichols said referencing a group called the Alabama Campaign for Adolescent Sexual Health PERIOD

Christina Clark Okarmus is the executive director for the Alabama Campaign for Adolescent Sexual Health which focuses on providing medically accurate and inclusive sexual health to adolescents as well as providing training to teachers in communities across Alabama PERIOD

What we found when talking to young people is that not only are they not receiving sexual health education and information about their bodies but theyre also wanting that information and not receiving it Clark Okarmus said attributing high rates of sexual assault and violence on college campuses to the fact that young people arent receiving sex education that includes consent PERIOD This information should be easily accessible to young people PERIOD They should be able to have trusted adults giving them this information about their bodies about relationships about consent. the lack of sexual health education disproportionately affects people of color and LGBTQ individuals causing them to be more susceptible to infections unplanned pregnancy and sexual violence PERIOD

We advocate for inclusive sex ed policies because we would be ignorant to not talk about gender identity and sexuality Clark Okarmus said PERIOD The health outcomes for LGBTQ young people are even worse than for young people who are cisgender andor heterosexual PERIOD The homeless rates are higher bullying rates are higher suicide ideation and suicide attempts are higher PERIOD Theres so much more that is happening in these communities because theyre not supported by the adults in their lives PERIOD It really is important for sexual health education to be inclusive of all sexual and gender identities. young people between the ages of  and  also account for over  in  new HIV infections in Alabama according to data from AIDSVu PERIOD Home to less than a third of the national population the U.S PERIOD South accounts for over  of new HIV infections PERIOD Alabama has a slightly better rate in HIV infections than neighboring states but what is concerning for Nichols is a spike in STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhea PERIOD

Nichols advice to everyone Always use protection and get tested regularly PERIOD

As a rural student going to The University of Alabama and exploring new frontiers and really finding myself and going through a lot of experiences I really should have been tested more regularly he said PERIOD But fear and stigma and misinformation kept me from doing so. abby Barrow a junior majoring in marine science and biology didnt have sex education in her Bibb County public school PERIOD Neither did James Pitard a sophomore majoring in finance and economics PERIOD Pitard a graduate of Birmingham public schools said the only sex education he received was a twohour session about puberty in the fifth grade PERIOD

Most people were either informed from their parents peers or church he said PERIOD

When he came to college Henry Pitts a junior majoring in environmental science felt like he couldnt relate to some of his outofstate peers whod often joke about awkward stories from their sexed classes PERIOD Thats because like Barrow and Pitard he didnt have sex education in his Tuscaloosa Catholic school PERIOD

My sex ed was like a twoweek module in seventh grade health class in which we watched strange 80s VHS tapes where a coach in supershort basketball shorts and a white polo being like Wash yourself and do a shower check he said PERIOD That was the extent of my sex ed. pitts said most of his peers didnt realize how limited their sexual education was and myths quickly began to spread around the lunch table PERIOD

A big thing that all of the guys in my high school thought was that there was one day a month that a girl could get pregnant Pitts said PERIOD So if you could figure out what day that was you were safe to have unprotected sex during the rest of the month. in her Baldwin County public school Ashley Hudson a current masters student in communication and information sciences spent half a semester learning drivers ed and the other half learning sex education during her junior year PERIOD She said the curriculum largely focused on consequences such as pregnancy and STIs and not about prevention such as testing and protection PERIOD Class time reserved for sex education was also spent on other topics like first aid and CPR PERIOD

Honestly it was completely pointless Hudson said PERIOD Outside of CPR I couldnt tell you a single thing that I retained from that class PERIOD They wouldve been better just leaving us alone with YouTube for the class and letting us learn through that. for students who arent exposed to a medically accurate sex education curriculum in school the internet or peertopeer education may be the only option PERIOD But that didnt sit easily with Pitts PERIOD

I just dont understand why we expect middle and high schoolers to have to sift through this wealth of knowledge  half of which is incorrect  for themselves Pitts said PERIOD Theyre going to figure it out eventually so why not just make it easy and correct the first time
