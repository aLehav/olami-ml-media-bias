7469,2023-03-31,"ohio University was one of the schools recognized by The Washington Post for its sustainability programmore specificallymitigating food waste in dining halls through composting PERIOD

The universitys process makes OU more climatefriendly while also saving roughly  a year in fertilizer costs however this is typically offset by labor costs Sam Crowl director of sustainability said PERIOD

When we think about sustainability we think about what were trying to do for people for the planet and for economic prosperity Crowl said PERIOD Its important to take all three of those things into consideration. the university uses the soil created from food waste throughout campus to assist with landscaping including flowerbeds and intramural fields PERIOD

The soil amendment that is produced from the compost operation is nutrientrich its just got so many healthy nutrients in it that helps everything grow Crowl said PERIOD

The Office of Sustainability and dining hall staff work together to compost leftover food to ensure the least amount will go into landfills PERIOD

Tim Bruce executive chef of culinary services explained that a majority of food waste is accumulated from leftover food from students PERIOD

Some  of our compost is postconsumer which is coming off the plates from students coming through the dining hall he said adding Our dish room staff then scrapes those plates into the various compost containers which we have dozens of at each location. when people leave OUs dining halls they place their leftover food on a conveyor belt for the culinary staff to dispose of the food into specific compost bins PERIOD Then five times a week the bins will be taken to the composting facility located at the Ridges PERIOD The food waste is mixed in a vessel with wood chips until it is broken down properly Crowl said PERIOD

At OU sustainability is encouraged before food even reaches the dining hall PERIOD Frank Pazzanese executive director of culinary services said the department considers sustainability when purchasing dishware PERIOD

We try to do a good job of finding compostable products and we still have a mandate by the university to stay within a budget sometimes this stuff costs as much as four times as the normal stuff Pazzanese said PERIOD

Pazzanese also emphasized how often the science can change about what makes a wellcompostable product PERIOD

For many years Pazzanese was told to use bamboo products due to its effectiveness in composting PERIOD However the culinary services later found out bamboo is extremely expensive and doesnt break down more than other compost products PERIOD

The initial reason the sustainability office started composting was due to the previous Director of Sustainability Sonia Marcus she applied for grants to help fund this project Crowl said PERIOD

The purpose of the project is to mitigate OUs production of methane gas and in turn mitigate its carbon footprint Crowl said PERIOD

The Washington Post article didnt really mention that the main purpose of this operation is not just that circular economy kind of process but that we were trying to keep that methaneproducing material out of the landfill Crowl said PERIOD

Pazzanese said he believes climate change is real and this kind of sustainability is crucial not only for OU but also for the earth PERIOD

Sometimes we dont want to focus on climate change and its just like we always think Well Ill be gone when I have to deal with it but were going to leave somebody thats part of us here to deal with it and thats not right Pazzanese said PERIOD
