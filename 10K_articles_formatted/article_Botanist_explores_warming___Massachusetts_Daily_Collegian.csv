Peter H PERIOD Raven president of the Missouri Botanical Garden and George Engelmann Professor of Botany at Washington University in St PERIOD Louis presented a talk titled Winning Sustainability in an Age of Global Change What is Our Responsibility Monday night at Amherst College PERIOD In his lecture Raven challenges people to not only ask what can be done to reverse these processes but also to be responsible moral citizens despite the fleeting pressures of time PERIOD  Professor Raven talked about the effects of global warming throughout the world citing his recent visit to Shishmaref Alaska an island located five miles from the mainland where he and other scientists saw evident effects of erosion in cliffs and shores showing a picture of a collapsed house that had previously been upright three days prior to his visit PERIOD  The permafrost in sand dunes on which many houses are built is softening and melting PERIOD Ocean ice is turning into loose slush causing dangerous and sometimes fatal conditions for hunters who frequently walk on the ice PERIOD  The International Climate Change Partnership ICCP estimates that in this century alone the sea level will rise  feet but recent findings indicate that it will rise at a much faster rate PERIOD Several places around the world such as the shores of Vietnam have thousands of families living directly on the water and with this rise in the sea level families and houses will inevitably encounter devastating situations PERIOD  Raven also explored population growth PERIOD According to Raven in  around the time that the Industrial Revolution began the human population was around eight million PERIOD Since then it rose to . billion PERIOD Raven said a majority of the population growth comes from developing countries while only a small portion is a result of developed ones PERIOD He said the population is growing so fast that in a sixweek span one million people are born in India and in a ninemonth span  million people are born in Vietnam PERIOD One out of every eight people in the world is starving and the increase in population is certainly not going to help this ratio according to Raven PERIOD The Global Footprint Network calculated how many planets Earth needs to support everyone at the current standard of living PERIOD With the current population it was determined that we need  percent of productivity on a continuous basis in order for support or . planets PERIOD If the population were to double it would take the productivity of two and a half earths and if we were to support the current population at the standard of developed countries it would take the productivity of three copies of our planet PERIOD Raven posed the question What will happen to our planet if our standards of living continue to rise along with our population Raven touched base on the fact that biodiversity on this planet is diminishing PERIOD The number and variety of different organisms on the planet is shrinking PERIOD He said the increased number of endangered and extinct plants and animals prove this PERIOD The majority of these species have not been seen and each one is a unique product of . billion years of evolution PERIOD These unknown species will continue to be unknown due to habitat destruction Raven said PERIOD He added that a cause of this is greenhouse gases rising and as a result of the global temperatures rise PERIOD Because of this change in temperature more terrain becomes dry and with this increase in dryness there will be an increase in forest fires according to Raven PERIOD  He said over the next century it is predicted that the amount of forest fires will double due to the dryness and as a result there will be major habitat destruction PERIOD Raven said that if the global temperature rises two degrees Celsius we will have unmanageable conditions on our planet. even if greenhouse gas emissions were stopped there still would be an inevitable .5degree Celsius increase in the global temperature PERIOD This extent of control over greenhouse gases is unlikely so he said we can only hope that our society will do something about this constant release of greenhouse gases so that we can keep this increase in global temperature to a minimum PERIOD Raven addressed those who take these global changes with a grain of salt by saying These current problems are not similar to problems we have encountered in the past PERIOD Those who believe that these problems can be solved by thinking the way we used to or using old techniques are certifiably nuts PERIOD Nothing about this situation represents what has happened in the past PERIOD These issues must be taken very seriously and approached in very different ways. he stressed the idea of promoting international understanding through the means of leadership emphasizing that there is no leadership as important as the leadership you provide for yourself. he expressed a need to continuously learn about these changes and then follow up what one has learned by means of action PERIOD He said that a key component in surviving this change is children and that they are the ones who are going to be most affected by these changes PERIOD He said it is important to get them involved at a young age and make them aware of nature and their surroundings so that when they are put into the situation where they are able to make a difference they will do so and be prepared PERIOD  The lecture ended with some words of wisdom from Gandhi The world provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed. raven has won many awards and held prestigious positions including being a member of President Clintons Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology and a U.S PERIOD National Medal of Science recipient in  PERIOD He won the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement was the Former Home Secretary of the U.S PERIOD National Academy of Sciences and was a recipient of an International Prize for Biology PERIOD Joshua Walovitch can be reached at emailprotected
