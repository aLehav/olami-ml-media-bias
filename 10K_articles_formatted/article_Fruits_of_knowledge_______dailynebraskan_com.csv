University education road to ordinary end

Kay Prauner is a senior newseditorial major assistant copy desk chief and a Daily Nebraskan columnist PERIOD

So what do you know these days

As the Venus of obsessiveness I should have known that at this tender track of my life  three months until my supposed graduation  that a question so simple would certainly hurl me further into my feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty PERIOD

As I thumbed through my mental crib sheet of all re and acquired knowledge from the past   years I reached a conclusion both im and depressive I know nothing really PERIOD

Actually so as to contradict myself a Gemini thing I have to admit that I do know a few things like how many picas go into an inch and that the word  always takes an object PERIOD Similarly I know that I share the same birthday as the late John Wayne and that the only medical nod toward the drug apomorphine is for making one puke PERIOD Im a veritable river of trivial frivolous information PERIOD

Nonetheless when the curtain crashes down I really cant say what exactly I know about the end of the show PERIOD I mean in what portion of my story will I be able to plug these mental plots

Now Im the first to admit that Ive spent most classes cerebrally lounging atop Harry Connicks best baby grand as he pounds out something like  and launches into his daily mantra of how much he respects me PERIOD And Im no stranger to staring vacantly into the blinking light of my VCR while pleasantly enjoying the fabric on my futon  anything to keep from studying PERIOD

But honestly when have I been allowed to learn what I want  or even in some cases need  to know

So lets see .. PERIOD I do know what people want me to know such people being school administrators and future employers PERIOD Similarly I do what people expect me to do thus inhibiting me from inserting  into my cover letters PERIOD

But if Im following everyone elses ideas of what I should know and do perhaps I should look into perfecting my Bleat rather than my Franaise PERIOD

Truthfully I find it repulsive that we spend all these years in educational facilities and still it seems as though were left with little to do with true knowledge PERIOD

Yeah I know so much for a profoundly fresh idea  you dont have to tell me twice PERIOD But thats exactly my point PERIOD What do we know thats new What do we know aside from what our schools choose to feed us which normally consists of a balance between antiquated arguments impersonal ideologies and tranceinducing terminologies

And as for our professors .. PERIOD those poor poor people PERIOD How frustrating it must be for them to look around a classroom know that they have so much to teach us and yet theyre constrained by curricula and discouraged by the disenchantment of their students PERIOD In fact it was one of my flustered professors who inspired me to look further into this problem PERIOD

So what is the method behind a universitys madness Why would anyone want us to read books and take exams only to forget what we crammed into our heads as soon as the book or exam is out of sight Why would we desire knowledge that pertains only to a certain area

I think that theologian and philosopher John Henry Newman said it best  even after nearly  centuries  in his work  where he proclaimed that 

Wow who wants to be ordinary And what does this say about any of our dreams and ideals Sure none of us wants to have to tell our loved ones that we cant provide what they need PERIOD But this only covers our most primary purposes for earning a degree A university education the ordinary means is one of the best methods in this day and age for attaining basic survival the ordinary end PERIOD

Perhaps this basicness stems from the fact that our education is incessantly weighed and measured PERIOD Our education serves as our personal meter stick PERIOD We  just as our education  are weighed and measured according to what the current system requires PERIOD

But who wants to build and build only to find that their constructed masterpiece doesnt measure up to someone elses standards Who wouldnt rather have their sidewalk supervisor tell them what they can do to improve the notsoperfect structure rather than simply dock their pay for doing something wrong Who wants an F in a class Its almost as though were being reprimanded for trying things at which we have no previous experience PERIOD Isnt trial and error all part of the learning process Sure it is PERIOD But at the same time the weight of our errors can bog us down so much that we cannot get up to try again PERIOD At times the weight is so constrictive that we decide its easier just to get by  and voil  were ordinary because we no longer try PERIOD And if we no longer try we give up our chances for greatness PERIOD

To quote Newman once again 

Certainly a university education may lend us the tools to build up to such greatness but unless we find the means for this greatness we will never reach a great end true knowledge PERIOD
