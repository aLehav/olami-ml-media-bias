If the Michigan womens basketball team had trouble with Penn State two weeks ago it wasnt any better Thursday night PERIOD

The Wolverines  Big Ten  overall shot uncharacteristically poorly in the first half digging themselves into a deficit they couldnt overcome PERIOD It didnt help that the 18thranked Lady Lions   shot  percent on the night PERIOD

Michigan tallied a seasonlow  points in the first half on 24percent shooting PERIOD None of the starters found rhythm early and a  run by Penn State in the first half seemed to seal the deal PERIOD The Lady Lions went on to win  PERIOD

Theyre a good team said junior forward Sam Arnold PERIOD They were getting great shots as well PERIOD We were trying to switch up our defense and throw different things at them based on whos in our lineup and cater to the players out on the court. unfortunately for the Wolverines no matter what defense they threw at it Penn State was going to make its shots PERIOD

The Lady Lions were yet again fueled by sophomore Maggie Lucas who led all scorers with  points PERIOD Juniors Alex Bentley and Nikki Greene also put up double figures scoring  and  points respectively PERIOD The trio was unstoppable combining for 23for33 shooting PERIOD

But it didnt work out as well for the Wolverines who made only eight shots in the first half and werent able to improve much in the second half PERIOD The Wolverines shot  percent overall and  percent from behind the arc PERIOD Arnold led the Wolverines with  points and junior guard Nya Jordan and senior guard Courtney Boylan each had  points PERIOD

Though it was an off night for Michigan the team believes it was getting the right looks PERIOD

We were getting a lot of open looks and it was just a matter of knocking them down Arnold said PERIOD They were making us move a lot faster and we just needed to slow down and take a good shot. added Jordan I think the game started off fast so a lot of us were getting good shots PERIOD We were shooting so fast because their defense was really fastpaced PERIOD We needed to take more time and focus on the shot. but the Wolverines couldnt execute that in Thursdays game PERIOD Every missed shot turned into a defensive rebound and an opportunity for Penn State to extend its lead PERIOD The lead was stretched to  at one point and it didnt help that Michigan went oneanddone almost every trip down the court PERIOD

Though the Wolverines had an off night Borseth wont detract from Penn States stellar play PERIOD

They are by and far the most talented team in our conference Borseth said PERIOD Theyre the team in our conference that can go and put a dent in the NCAA tournament because they have all the pieces in the puzzle PERIOD Theyre big fast strong athletic and have the shooters and skills PERIOD Theyre a really good team. note Senior guard Carmen Reynolds tied the program record for career 3pointers tonight when she hit the shot early in the second half PERIOD She now sits atop the list with Alayne Ingram  with  career 3pointers PERIOD
