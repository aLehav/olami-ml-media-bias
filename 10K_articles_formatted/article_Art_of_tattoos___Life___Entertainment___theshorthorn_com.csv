Brandon McKeever tattoo artist at Urban Tattoo in Arlington talks about the state of tattooing PERIOD























Art is a big umbrella which many forms take shelter underneath PERIOD

Art is defined as the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the production of aesthetic objects according to MerriamWebster PERIOD

There are many different ways for artistic expression to take hold on these aesthetic objects one of them being the human body PERIOD Many would say tattooing is an art form in which an artist can express themselves and the tattooed are a walking gallery for the world to see PERIOD

Tattooing is definitely an art form  its also an expensive art form said Brandon McKeever tattoo artist at Urbans Tattoo Shop in Arlington PERIOD

McKeever said there is more that goes into tattooing than people might think PERIOD Tattooing requires complete dedication learning the ins and outs of the art and knowing basics of structure and color McKeever said PERIOD

Then there are others things to consider when tattooing including the line work and weight sanitation and being your own accountant he said PERIOD

You have to really be in some senses a jack of all trades McKeever said PERIOD But to make good tattoos you have to know how to use your equipment. that being said it doesnt mean that any artist can pick up a coil or rotary machine and tattoo a masterpiece on someones body he said PERIOD

McKeever said they currently have a guy who is already a phenomenal artist who is coming in to learn the art of tattooing PERIOD

We know for a fact that hell be a great tattoo artist but to catch up his tattoo skills to his actual drawing skills takes years McKeever said PERIOD

McKeever said the most challenging part about tattooing is the permanence of the tattoo which is why its important that it looks good all around PERIOD For him there is a difference between being a successful artist and just someone who makes tattoos PERIOD

Its a representation of them and me so I want to make sure its a good one McKeever said PERIOD

Like any other art form tattooing takes time and dedication PERIOD The art of tattooing itself has evolved within the last  years PERIOD

In the early 2000s people who wanted tattoos were at the mercy of what the tattoo artist could draw McKeever said PERIOD Now people can come in after doing research of what they want and who they want to tattoo them he said PERIOD This is able to be done because of the developments in tattooing equipment he said PERIOD

You couldnt just go into a tattoo shop and tell the artist what you wanted McKeever said PERIOD It was based on what they wanted to do. every artist has a particular style of tattooing McKeever said from more tradition small tattoos to comic book characters to color realism tattoos

Advertising senior Michael Frausto said he has over  tattoos on his body PERIOD His right arm is covered in tattoos representative of things that relate to his family Frausto said PERIOD

Advertising senior Michael Fraustohas over  tattoos on his body PERIOD His right arm is covered in tattoos representative of things that relate to his family Frausto said PERIOD

Overall Frausto said hes gone to three different artists to have some of his pieces done PERIOD One of the artists specializes in smaller tattoos another specializes in black and gray work and the other does a lot of color pieces he said PERIOD

Psychology senior Christy Duong said she has over  tattoos spread out on the sleeve of her arm and a back piece PERIOD Duong said her tattoos are all representative and serve as reminders of Asian culture PERIOD

Psychology senior Christy Duonghas over  tattoos spread out on the sleeve of her arm and a back piece PERIOD

The artist who drew Duongs back piece of a fox took what Duong wanted into mind put the vision on paper and then on her back she said PERIOD

McKeever said many tattoo artists and those who get tattoos chose to do so because of the sense of rebellion and individualism tattoo art provides PERIOD

Whenever I finish a tattoo theyll have this new confidence because theyll have this piece of themselves showing to the world McKeever said PERIOD

Frausto said its a representation of whats on the inside and it gives him a sense of confidence PERIOD

My arm looks great because its covered in tattoos Frausto said PERIOD

Duong said she loves the way tattoos look and what they represent for different people PERIOD She said she gets to wear pieces of art on her PERIOD

If I cant draw I want art on me somehow PERIOD I like that its on you forever Duong said PERIOD I dont get tired of looking at them. getting tattoos done is an investment Frausto said he likes to make PERIOD He said he loves tattoos because they arent gone in the morning PERIOD















A tattoo can mean different things for different people PERIOD For some its an ode to a loved one who has passed away or memory of a former life etched permanently into flesh PERIOD

I appreciate the talent it takes to tattoo but I hate them PERIOD They are bad on men but on women they are truly terrible PERIOD Ive almost never with one exception seen a tattoo on a female that I preferred over their natural skin PERIOD If you have any beauty whatsoever why cover it up Maybe Im in the minority but how many married guys are glad they will never get to see their wifes skin again I dont understand how a married male would enjoy seeing a family portrait or video game logo or whatever on their wife during intimacy PERIOD And even if they look  on day one they turn to ugly mush as you age PERIOD The ONLY female tattoo I didnt mind on a female was a woman that had her stump arm tattooed PERIOD A tattoo over a deformity is the only way a tattoo can improve a females body PERIOD

And there you have it folks a misogynist PERIOD

I dont enjoy males destroying their bodies and I particularly dont enjoy females destroying their bodies because I think they have more to lose than the males do PERIOD Is believing males are less beautiful than females make me a misogynist nowadays to you  progressives I cant keep up nor do I care to PERIOD
