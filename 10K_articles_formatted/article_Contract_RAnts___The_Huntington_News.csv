Thanks to the administration Resident Assistants could be moving out of their luxurious Speare singles to a new location  The picket line PERIOD

The administration recently announced to its RAs it will institute minor changes to the current RA contract PERIOD RAs working the front desk of residence halls must check in at the Resident Directors office on Columbus Avenue PERIOD RAs will also see their hours doubled in the event they miss a shift without rescheduling PERIOD

These are minor issues not exactly on par with your average Nike sweatshop but it raises a larger question  What is the point of a contract if the administration wont honor it

Isnt that why contracts are signed in the first place  to establish in writing the terms of commitment What if the university raised tuition midsemester and didnt say a word until you got the bill Actually lets not give them any ideas PERIOD

And according to the RAs who spoke at Thursdays SGA meeting this is not the first time the administration has rewritten the contract in the middle of the night PERIOD

Now certainly its hard to cry for people receiving room and board for a job that really only requires them to show up PERIOD But RAs are employees of the university and like employees in the real world have the right to be treated fairly PERIOD

Even stranger is Vice President of Student Affairs Ed Klotzbiers claim RAs are employees yet their contract forbids them from unionizing or speaking to the media  two restrictions that reek of a power trip PERIOD

The administration was offensively out of bounds in assuming it could tamper with an existing contract without notifying those it most affects PERIOD

Obviously something needs to be done if RAs arent showing up for shifts particularly front desk shifts PERIOD

All the administration had to do was set up a negotiation between themselves and the RAs PERIOD But they didnt PERIOD And now they have alienated their entire workforce PERIOD

Maybe its fair RAs be punished for neglecting their jobs PERIOD If you regularly skip coop you get in trouble PERIOD The difference is theres a good chance your boss will tell you to your face PERIOD In this instance the administration acted in cowardice PERIOD

The RAs need to remember something as these proceedings go further PERIOD They are the only ones who can incite change PERIOD The administration will not have a change of heart on the issue PERIOD
