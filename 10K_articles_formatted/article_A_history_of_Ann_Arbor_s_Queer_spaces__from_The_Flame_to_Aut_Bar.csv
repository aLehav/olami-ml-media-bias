One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom



Sitting back and chatting with friends enjoying the perfect weather and pleasantly buzzed off of a watermelon fros I looked around and wondered why Id never noticed this place PERIOD I worked right across the street in the Kerrytown Shops and mustve walked by it a hundred times PERIOD It was secluded and quiet the drinks were good and the bar served a mean brick oven pizza PERIOD It felt like Id discovered one of the citys bestkept secrets and like Narnia I became irrationally worried that it would only ever reveal itself to me again when I wasnt looking for it PERIOD

This of course wasnt the case and the Bar at  Braun Court easily became my favorite bar in the city PERIOD But it took a couple more visits for me to get over my tunnel vision which was focused on Aperol spritzes and margherita pizza PERIOD Seven buildings all commercial despite their residential facades surround the courtyard PERIOD On one side the Bar Spiral Tattoo and Trillium Real Estate the four on the opposite side are empty PERIOD As welcoming as Braun Court is its impossible to ignore the spaces vague feeling of lopsidedness PERIOD

During another visit one night in August  I looked up at one of the shuttered buildings and noticed the signage that still remained PERIOD The house was white with green trim and a sign with a bright yellow and pink logo announced the space as what it used to be Aut Bar named after the phonetic spelling of the word out PERIOD

Id heard about Aut Bar PERIOD In my second semester at the University of Michigan I made a friend whom I as a transfer who was desperately looking for other Queer people in Ann Arbor latched onto as something of a gay mentor PERIOD She gave me two recommendations for where to find gay culture the coops and Aut Bar  the latter being the citys only gay bar PERIOD I shouldve taken her advice sooner PERIOD Only a month after she gave it everything  including Aut Bar  was shutting down as COVID19 started to spread throughout the country PERIOD

I hadnt thought much about the bar since I was made aware of it but I remembered seeing on social media that it would be closing permanently in June  PERIOD As I looked up at its empty shell in August I found myself feeling sorry that I hadnt seized the few weeks between that initial introduction and the outset of the pandemic to experience the bar myself PERIOD

After I recognized Aut Bars absence I realized how disconnected and sparse Ann Arbors gay scene really was PERIOD It was true that Ann Arbor felt like it had a larger louder gay population than East Lansing where I had spent two years previously as a student at Michigan State University and it certainly had more of one than where I grew up PERIOD I knew firsthand that Ann Arbor lived up to its reputation for being gayfriendly PERIOD The University had the Spectrum Center the first staff office for queer students in an institution of higher learning in the United States and there were always Friday nights at Necto PERIOD But what really did the city of Ann Arbor have to show for its gay community other than what I can only call the vibes For as gay as Ann Arbor touted itself as being where was the citys physical evidence for this claim

In January of this year I had another coincidental runin with Braun Court PERIOD A friend asked me to come along to a discussion group at the Jim Toy Community Center  an LGBTQ resource center named after the pioneering Ann Arbor gayrights activist who founded the Human Sexuality Office now the Universitys Spectrum Center  that they found online supposedly two doors down from the empty Aut Bar space PERIOD Knowing the area and its vacant spaces I was confused but went along anyway hoping that Id just missed something PERIOD

Surely enough we ended up circling the courtyard a few times looking up at the dark quiet houses and wondering if we were being punked PERIOD A supplementary Google search revealed that after  years at  Braun Court the center announced the closure of its physical space in early January  PERIOD

An image of what Braun Court used to be started coming together in my head PERIOD The skeletons of Aut Bar the Jim Toy Community Center and Common Language  the LGBTQ bookstore between them  painted a picture of the little courtyard as a former center of gay community in Ann Arbor PERIOD With my regret at having just missed the tail end of Aut Bars run revived and a new curiosity about not only Braun Courts gay history but Ann Arbors I resolved to do a little research of my own PERIOD



Keith Orr and Martin Contreras Aut Bars owners of  years could write the book on the gay history of Ann Arbor PERIOD Both graduated from the University in   Orr with a degree in double bass performance and Contreras with degrees in psychology and physical therapy  and their lives have more or less revolved around Ann Arbor ever since PERIOD

I met them at the Sculpture Park in Kerrytown less than a minutes walk from Braun Court PERIOD Despite their amiable open demeanors and excitement to talk with me about Ann Arbors gay community  something they were clearly so passionate about  I was nervous to meet them PERIOD A quick Google search of their names or of Aut Bars will reveal their local celebrity pages and pages of interviews and writeups and tributes after the bars closing was announced PERIOD

I asked them about their time as undergraduates and with the precision of seasoned storytellers with steeltrap memories who have been asked to tell certain stories multiple times over both said that they knew they were gay at a young age but were having trouble coming out in their early days at the University PERIOD Separately they found their ways to the thenHuman Sexuality Office whose aforementioned founder Jim Toy they got to know later in life PERIOD Contreras left his first Rap Session a discussionbased support group at the HSO and slammed that closet shut. however Contreras added that Staying closeted sort of eats away at who you are and it only took a few more months for him to go back to the HSO and start frequenting The Flame a bar at  West Washington Street where Frita Batidos is currently located PERIOD He and Orr met there in  PERIOD

The Flame opened in  and after a relocation across the street which only lasted three years closed in  PERIOD Although not gayowned it became the citys de facto gay bar in the 60s PERIOD It was a dive Orr said but In many ways it was considered kind of safe because cops didnt want to go in the gay bar PERIOD Theyd harass you outside but they didnt really want to come in PERIOD It was really a safe space even though it really did nothing to build community PERIOD It was the only place you could really gather out in the community. contreras agreed describing The Flame as dark and dingy but beloved by the gay male community because it was the only place in town PERIOD It was a friendly place and bartenders were friendly. under management by Harvey Blanchard The Flames owner of  years Contreras said the bar was nonplus about the community of gay men that had found something of a home within its walls PERIOD During the height of the HIVAIDS epidemic in the United States gay bars on the coasts became places to band together organize and stay connected to the community PERIOD This was not the case for The Flame following new ownership by Andy Gulvezan in  PERIOD

Orr recalled One of the bartenders David had put a collection jar for HARC HIVAIDS Resource Center and Andy happened to come in the bar saw it got really upset told him to take it away PERIOD AIDS is depressing PERIOD Itll be bad for business. so there was literally no recognition in the bar that the AIDS crisis was going on PERIOD There were no posters about safe sex PERIOD There was nothing. the Flame was Ann Arbors primary public gathering and socializing spot for gay men for decades nothing of the kind existed for gay women PERIOD However in early the 70s a disco called the Rubaiyat  at  South First Street in the space LIVE now occupies  became popular for both groups PERIOD Although it was imperfect in its attitudes toward gay people complaints about discrimination were brought against it multiple times specifically by lesbians its popularity only increased over the next few decades hosting local DJs and musicians drag nights and an annual Miss Ann Arbor drag pageant PERIOD Legend has it that Madonna during her stint as a School of Music Theatre  Dance student at the University and Leonard Bernstein when he toured across the country with musicians frequented the club PERIOD

Contreras said Everyone went back and forth from the Flame to the Rubaiyat because it was just across the parking lot PERIOD We did that all night. the Rubaiyats popularity declined in the mid 80s  it closed in  and was converted into a Greek restaurant by longtime owner Greg Fenerli whose attitude toward gay people was also by his own admission imperfect and the Flames decline began in the early 90s PERIOD Near the end Orr and Contreras had taken to calling it Andys Spare Parts Bar as Gulvezan had begun taking resources from the Flame to replace what broke in his other properties on Main Street PERIOD They recalled the eventual absence of both an ice machine and working furnace which was replaced by propane heaters on the bar leaving the whole place smelling of gasoline PERIOD

As the era of the Flame came to a close Orr and Contreras saw a desperate need for a positive affirming visible allwelcoming space in Ann Arbor that could meet the needs of the gay community. luckily they already had somewhere to put that space PERIOD While working as a physical therapist in  Contreras opened a restaurant with his mother in the building Aut Bar would eventually occupy PERIOD La Casita de Lupe serving regional Mexican cuisine was meant to provide retirement income for his mother who had moved out of Detroit during the crack cocaine epidemic after falling victim to multiple instances of gun violence PERIOD Sadly she was diagnosed with terminal cancer the day before the restaurants opening and less than a year later Contreras found himself having to manage it without her PERIOD

In  when he and Orr were looking for space for their bar they ultimately decided to transform La Casita de Lupe instead PERIOD

Aut Bar came together with a tiny budget of  and a lot of help from friends PERIOD In only three months during which time they hired a structural engineer to reinforce the second floor to accommodate patrons upstairs and designers to help redo the space it was finished PERIOD The name was decided upon after multiple fruitless discussions when a friend impatiently asked You know it seems youre talking about this whole philosophy about being out why dont you just fucking call it the Out Bar The idea for the name to reflect the phonetic spelling of the word came from Contreras who wanted to distinguish it from other gayrelated out institutions like Out Magazine PERIOD

After an incredibly successful soft launch in August  they were off to the races PERIOD Orr worked front of house and Contreras wrote the food and drink menus PERIOD The patio courtyard and dining room downstairs were small but mighty sometimes accommodating hundreds of people at a time PERIOD They described the upstairs space where guests could dance and shoot pool as feeling ethereal and floaty. they hosted trivia drag nights movie nights and champagne brunches PERIOD

Over the years they also opened SHaut a gallery and performance space across the courtyard and bought Common Language in  after its original owners went into retirement PERIOD In those days nicknames for Braun Court included Gay Central the Queer Quad the Gayborhood and the Homoplex which was bestowed upon it by Queer performance artist Michelle Tea who frequently made Ann Arbor and SHaut a stop on her tours with the poetry roadshow Sister Spit PERIOD

Perhaps even more than its function as a social hub though Orr and Contreras described Aut Bar as a gathering place in times of both celebration and mourning PERIOD Their busiest day was in late June  when the Supreme Courts  decision in Obergefell v PERIOD Hodges ruled in favor of marriage equality PERIOD

We knew a decision was coming Orr said PERIOD We didnt know exactly when because the court doesnt tell you that and of course we didnt know which way it would go PERIOD So the whole staff was on notice PERIOD Whenever the decision comes down people are gonna gather here whether its to mourn or celebrate and were gonna need you here. on that June day the decision fell and camera crews showed up and created a roadblock on Fourth Avenue with former staff and even regular customers jumping in to help bus tables and run ice PERIOD

They hosted a candlelight vigil following Orlandos Pulse nightclub shooting in   by their estimate over  attended despite short notice of the event  united by a slate of speakers including Jim Toy and Ypsilantis and Ann Arbors mayors PERIOD Aut Bar also raised thousands of dollars in the face of a visit by the Westboro Baptist Church in which donors from across the country pledged a certain amount of money for every minute the picketers remained outside of the bar PERIOD

The word community came up multiple times throughout our conversation with Orr and Contreras using it on many occasions to distinguish Aut Bars effect on the city and its Queer customers from the effect of a place like the Flame PERIOD The true openness of Aut Bar its ability to allow Queer people to congregate and unify safely  to celebrate protest or grieve as loudly as they wanted  was unlike anything the city had seen before or has seen since PERIOD

Thinking back to the silence my friend and I experienced that January evening as we looked around Braun Court I couldnt help but feel irrationally jealous of all of the people who had gotten to experience the courtyard in its prime when people would stay at Aut Bar until  a.m PERIOD

After nearly  years Orr and Contreras sold Aut Bar to BarStar Group in  which also owns Babs Underground Nightcap and LoFi PERIOD Although they were grateful for what they had been able to do and for what Aut Bar had become to the city they were physically and emotionally burnt out PERIOD We lived there to the neglect of everything else PERIOD There was a lot of satisfaction to it but we were just exhausted Orr said PERIOD Folks asked us What are you gonna do in your retirement My favorite response was Well they say its impossible to actually catch up on missed sleep but were gonna try. and we did the first couple of months PERIOD We slept a lot. orr and Contreras described Aut Bars history and impact with so much detail and pride that for a second I was convinced that I wanted to drop all of my plans for the future and pursue a masters in business just so I could try to revamp the bar myself PERIOD In talking to them I realized that I was getting a glimpse of what it mightve been like to sit at the bar across from them and ask them to tell me their life stories PERIOD I realized that theyd created the kind of space that they had needed at the height of the AIDS crisis and even though Id never be able to go to Aut Bar myself I couldnt help but feel grateful for that PERIOD

Of the current state of gay spaces in Ann Arbor Orr said its pretty much nonexistent PERIOD Nothing against Nectos Friday night but a space thats a gay dance bar once a week can never really be a community center PERIOD If something cataclysmic happens within the gay community a Pulse or if the Supreme Court after abortion starts going after gay rights  since theyre based on the same legal principles  where do we go Where do we organize

Contreras added With all the fun people had at Aut Bar there was a lot of sitting at tables and over a cocktail figuring out how to respond to different situations planning PERIOD How do you respond to Fred Phelps How do you respond to an assault How do you respond to a politician like John Engler or Richard Snyder

Orr and Contreras also drew a line between gay spaces and gayfriendly spaces echoing some of my own thoughts PERIOD In a gay space you have that sense of Theres  people here who are here to enjoy each other and enjoy being Queer. thats just a different vibe than going out to dinner at a gayfriendly place Contreras said PERIOD Aut Bar was more than just a bar and grill. i dont want to discount or disregard what a power and privilege it is to be able to exist as a gay person in Ann Arbor and feel safe while doing so PERIOD I can walk down the street holding a girls hand or kiss her in public without fear of bodily harm and the importance of that cant  and shouldnt  be understated PERIOD Still its hard to get a drink at Braun Court and look across the way to see Aut Bar Common Language and the Jim Toy Community Center sitting empty knowing what they used to be or could still be PERIOD

There is profound power in congregation PERIOD I felt it the first time I went to a pride parade  New York City in  on the fiftieth anniversary of the Stonewall Riots  and felt surrounded by Queer people who had claimed the middle of Manhattan as our own at least for a day PERIOD To congregate is also to validate and to claim  to claim a space a shared identity a right to exist PERIOD

In talking to Orr and Contreras I also realized how isolated in Queer youth I am PERIOD I realized that theres so much I will never be able to understand PERIOD I didnt experience the AIDS crisis I can never fully understand what it was like to live through the devastation of a generation of people PERIOD The world that I came into has been on the whole more open to Queer people than the world that they came into PERIOD

Aut Bar was a place to congregate for Queer people of all kinds to come together and learn from each other to celebrate ourselves to demand that the world open up even more to us PERIOD

I wish I couldve gone I lamented to Orr and Contreras near the end of our conversation PERIOD

We wish you couldve too Orr replied with a rueful smile PERIOD

I hope that someone else sees the same desperate need for a space to accommodate the gay community that Orr and Contreras saw in  PERIOD I hope that I get to see it PERIOD
