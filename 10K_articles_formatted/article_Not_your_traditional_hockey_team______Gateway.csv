In their third year of existence they stand at the top of their league PERIOD They dont take chartered flights to their destination and they dont have 8000plus fans screaming at their games PERIOD No the UNO womens hockey club plays for passion love of the game and respect in the world of womens hockey PERIOD

How cute you say Cute indeed just ask the men from the Metro Classic Hockey League to whom the Maverick women taught a lesson or two in their scrimmage last Thursday at Benson Ice Arena PERIOD Imagine a bunch of grumpy old men getting made fools of by fueled females PERIOD It was ugly but the only joke in the place was the arena itself PERIOD

Benson Ice Arena hardly has the luxurious conditions to which the Maverick mens hockey team is accustomed PERIOD The lobby is the locker room PERIOD It has the same sheet of ice it had when it opened three centuries before the gold rush PERIOD It is the kind of place where you watch from the stands and see your own breath and the boards are so low that if you stand in certain places your head is in danger of flying pucks PERIOD The doors squeak like they came off old barns PERIOD The ice is so jaded it could cut diamonds let alone bare flesh and the women rent it out every Thursday night for  for one hour PERIOD They have been forced to play games at  in the morning and at  at night at Benson because of scheduling conflicts PERIOD Raw deal PERIOD

One practice a week is all they get and every other week they play a series in the Womens College Hockey League PERIOD So what happens when it comes to road trip time Chartered bus Are you kidding They pack their own equipment in their own cars and road trip it in true broke college person style PERIOD They struggled as a unit through two years of hapless hockey with two wins in two years to add to the terrible conditions PERIOD

This year however the Maverick women are  PERIOD They lead the WCHL and they swept WisconsinWhitewater who hadnt lost in three years PERIOD They are pumped and ready for their tournament this weekend in Chicago and even more excited about hosting the league tournament starting April  at MoylenTranquillity Ice Plex PERIOD Rumor has it that some Jesuit school from North Bend Ind. will have a team coming PERIOD Along with Notre Dames possible appearance the other five schools  Illinois Northwestern WisconsinMadison WisconsinWhitewater and Iowa State  will be there PERIOD

Head coach Al Murphy came aboard at the beginning of the season when he heard from team captain Colleen Barry they needed a coach PERIOD Murphy has been coaching in the citys Omaha Metro Amateur Hockey Association high school teams for  years PERIOD

I dont coach them any differently than I coach the boys Murphy said PERIOD I dont yell I explain. murphy had his work cut out for him when shaping the ladies into fierce competitors PERIOD Murphy went back to basics and taught shooting passing basic drills and hockey essentials PERIOD He had to get space at the HPER building a few times to have the space he needed PERIOD

Thursday the women went back to the ice to stare the stronger race in the face but not for the first time PERIOD The Maverick women have trouble finding teams to scrimmage but the guys of the MCHL are always willing to be guinea pigs PERIOD

Although they cant check there are definitely no powder puffs here PERIOD Despite missing starting goalie J.B PERIOD Jones and having Elisa Booth usually a winger between the pipes for just her second time the women took the game to the guys and had pulled even with them at  halfway through the third period PERIOD

After the second goal a beautiful rebound goal after a nice setup play Murphy turned and said Not bad for once a week. overcoming road travel and terrible playing conditions to post a  record PERIOD First place in their league PERIOD Making waves in the frozen world of womens hockey PERIOD

Not bad at all PERIOD
