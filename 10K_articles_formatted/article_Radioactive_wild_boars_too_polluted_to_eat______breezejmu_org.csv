Radioactive wild boars in Bavaria PERIOD Joachim Reddemann via SWNS

By Jim Leffman via SWNS

Radioactive wild boars in Bavaria are too polluted to eat with some having  times the safety levels a new study has revealed PERIOD

It was believed that the Chernobyl nuclear accident was largely responsible but the new study shows it is nuclear tests from  to  years ago that have kept them contaminated PERIOD

The shaggyhaired tusked pigs roam free in the woods of Germany and Austria but because they root out truffles and other food to eat from polluted soil their levels are still high PERIOD

In contrast other animals affected by Chernobyl have much lower levels than the pigs whose radioactive caesium levels render their meat unsafe to eat PERIOD

Radioactive caesium is a byproduct of nuclear weapons explosions and nuclear energy production PERIOD

It poses risks to public health when it enters the environment and Europe got a large dose of radioactive caesium contamination following the Chernobyl power plant accident in   years ago PERIOD

Whilst caesium137 has declined in most game animals since then the levels of contamination in wild pigs has remained more or less the same PERIOD

This has resulted in their meat continuing to exceed regulatory limits for consumption a drop in hunting and an overpopulation of the animals in Europe PERIOD

This led researchers from Technische University in Vienna and Leibniz University in Hannover to investigate why the radioactive levels havent fallen PERIOD

They found that the pigs still had high levels of caesium135 a much longerlived form produced during nuclear fission PERIOD

The team worked with hunters to collect wild boar meat from across Southern Germany and then measured the caesium137 levels with a gammaray detector PERIOD

To determine the origin of the radioactivity the team compared the amount of caesium135 to cesium137 with a sophisticated mass spectrometer PERIOD

A high ratio points to nuclear weapons explosions whereas a low ratio implicates nuclear reactors PERIOD

They found that  percent of the  meat samples exceeded German regulatory limits for radioactive caesium in food according to the study published in the journal Environmental Science  Technology PERIOD

For the samples with elevated levels the researchers calculated the ratios of caesium135 to cesium137 and found that nuclear weapons testing supplied between  and  per cent of the contamination PERIOD

In some samples the amount of caesium from weapons alone exceeded regulatory limits PERIOD

Study author Dr PERIOD Georg Steinhauser from Technische University said The mid20th century weapons tests were an underappreciated source of radioactive caesium to German soil which was also unevenly impacted by the Chernobyl accident PERIOD





In some cases weapons137Cs alone can lead to exceedances of the regulatory limit especially in samples with a relatively low total 137Cs level PERIOD

Future nuclear accidents or explosions could worsen these animals contamination potentially impacting food safety for decades.With the intensifying war between Ukraine and Russia much concern has been expressed about the terrible consequences of a nuclear war or a combattriggered nuclear accident PERIOD

Both contributors form an intense 137Cs source that exceeds the contribution from any singular yet dominant source in the area like Chernobyl in the case of Bavaria PERIOD
