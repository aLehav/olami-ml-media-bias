For the second straight season the Wisconsin football team dropped its Big Ten opener PERIOD

This year the Badgers   Big Ten fell to Iowa    in a defensive battle Saturday afternoon at Camp Randall Stadium PERIOD

Despite a dominant defensive performance from Joe Schobert an Iowa touchdown and field goal in the first half provided all of the scoring the Hawkeyes would need PERIOD Running back Jordan Canzeri paced the Iowa offense with  yards on  carries PERIOD

Rafael Gaglianone connected on two 46yard field goals but missed a 42yard attempt to account for all of Wisconsins scoring PERIOD

Wisconsin quarterback Joel Stave turned the ball over four times throwing two interceptions and losing two fumbles while throwing for  yards 21for38 PERIOD



Heres a breakdown of the game

King picked off Stave twice one setting the Iowa offense up for points and the other squashing a lengthy Wisconsin drive PERIOD

The junior cornerbacks first interception came on a Stave throw into traffic PERIOD The ball wound up right in Kings hands and he returned it  yards down the right sideline to the Wisconsin 31yard line PERIOD

The Hawkeyes would score the games only touchdown on the ensuing offensive possession which ultimately turned out to be the difference on the scoreboard PERIOD

On their first possession of the second half the Badgers had driven  yards downfield when King came up big again PERIOD On a 3rdand12 from the Iowa  Stave floated a pass toward an open Jordan Frederick who had beaten King PERIOD But Stave underthrew the ball and King came down with it at the 11yard line PERIOD

King added nine tackles and two pass breakups as well PERIOD

The offense may not have done him any favors but Schobert still almost found a way to singlehandedly win Saturdays game for the Badgers PERIOD

Schobert was all over the field sacking Iowa quarterback C.J PERIOD Beathard three times including a pivotal sackfumble which he also recovered in the fourth quarterthat shifted momentum to the Badgers for a moment PERIOD

Of Schoberts eight tackles five solo three assisted three were for a loss PERIOD He also had five quarterback hurries PERIOD

Football Badgers fall short in defensive battle with HawkeyesIn a game dominated by defensive play the Wisconsin football team fell just short in their Big Ten opener Saturday Read

The Wisconsin offense was on the verge of rewarding the defense for its superb performance PERIOD

A pass interference call placed the Badgers on the oneyard line PERIOD All that needed to happen was for Taiwan Deal to plunge into the end zone like he has done four times already this season and Wisconsin would take a late  lead PERIOD

That was the play call too PERIOD But as Stave dropped back to hand the ball off center Dan Voltzs foot tripped Stave and as Stave fellto the turf he tried to get the ball to his running back PERIOD

Instead Iowa defensive linemans Faith Ekakities pounced on the loose balland the games momentum shifted back toward the Hawkeyes where it would remain until the final whistle PERIOD

The defense gave the Badgers yet another chance to win PERIOD Wisconsin took over at its own  with  remaining PERIOD

A completion to Reggie Love brought the Badgers to the Iowa  and with the Badgers facing a 4thand2 Iowa took a timeout with  seconds on the clock PERIOD

Staves final pass attempt fell incomplete near the far sideline intended for Troy Fumagalli ending any opportunity for any lategame heroics PERIOD

Vince Biegel on how disappointing the loss was from a defensive standpoint

We didnt get the job done on defense today PERIOD They scored too many points PERIOD They scored more points than our offense PERIOD Its a loss. iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz on Joe Schobert

Schobert boy Ill tell you hes a football player PERIOD That doesnt surprise me PERIOD He played like that last year PERIOD Last year I thought he was a great football player and hes playing at a really high level right now. uW head coach Paul Chryst on offensive struggles particularly the running game

I think its everyone on offense  I thought today there were some good runs but we havent been consistent and so I think we all have to own it PERIOD We all want to own it quite honestly. joel Stave on the defenses play

Obviously its disappointing PERIOD I thought the defense did a tremendous job continuing to battle giving us opportunities PERIOD We just have to come away with something. tyler Marz on offensive miscues

I think we kind of beat ourselves and beat ourselves quite a bit this game. this article was published Oct   at  pm and last
