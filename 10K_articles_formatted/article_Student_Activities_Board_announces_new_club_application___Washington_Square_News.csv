This year students aiming to form an AllSquare club will have a new club application process requiring them to submit a sample event calendar and a petition with  signatures PERIOD All existing clubs will also be subject to a new audit this fall PERIOD

The Student Activities Board reviews all applications for AllSquare clubs PERIOD The SAB decided to make these changes to the New Club Development program this summer PERIOD

Chair of SAB and CAS senior Mason Dettloff explained that these new requirements are added to the application used in previous years which requires general information about the club  a club name a mission statement examples of the clubs uniqueness and a list of similar NYU clubs  and a list of four founding members of the new club PERIOD

With a hypothetical budget of  the sample event calendar must include three events for the fall semester and three events for the spring semester PERIOD

The additions to the application were done to enhance the application process and to provide a higher quality pool of applicants to the NCD program Dettloff said PERIOD

The SAB began accepting applications on Sept PERIOD  and will not accept them after Oct PERIOD  PERIOD The approval process takes a full academic year PERIOD

CAS sophomore Kelly Davis is the cofounder of the NYU chapter of the Harry Potter Alliance Club PERIOD She plans to apply to become an official club this fall PERIOD

We  want to promote humanitarian efforts like fighting homelessness and promoting education in the city Davis said PERIOD We want to be a kind of Dumbledores Army in the muggle world. in order to meet the petition requirements Davis said she hopes to collect the newly required signatures at the first unofficial meeting on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

One of the difficult things about not being an official club is not being able to find anywhere to host the meetings Davis said PERIOD We cant get space at Kimmel and a lot of the other buildings because of that. the new rules also include an audit of the over  existing clubs PERIOD The audits will be conducted by the SAB and begin in midOctober PERIOD The board will look at each clubs membership constitution events and activities in order to check the overall health of AllSquare clubs PERIOD

These are all things that fall within SABs jurisdiction but have not been closely examined for quite a few years Dettloff said PERIOD

Dettloff added that there are no current plans to make the audit yearly PERIOD

CAS senior Brian Kang president of the NYU Chess Club believes that the new requirements make sense but said the petition may be asking for too much PERIOD

One hundred seems like an insane number Kang said PERIOD Meanwhile club officers approve of the new audit PERIOD An audit which is a reflection of a stronger commitment to transparency shows that the school takes funding for the clubs seriously said Milton Koh president of the Singapore Students Organization and Steinhardt senior PERIOD Which to me means that it is committed to making and ensuring the entire system runs smooth. a version of this article appeared in the Tuesday Sept PERIOD  print edition.Kaidia Pickels andAfeefa Tariq are contributing writers PERIOD Email them at emailprotected PERIOD
