Greta Thunberg has been making headlines for more than two years after her solo School Strike for Climate protests outsidethe Swedish parliament grew into a worldwide phenomenon PERIOD

Since then she has attended numerous summits conferences and even spoken at the United Nations about the climate crisis PERIOD Thunberg has received countless recognitions and awards for her work and was Time Magazines Person of the Year in  PERIOD Although she has been a public figure since  her personal journey has remained mostly private until now PERIOD

Director Nathan Grossmans latest documentary I Am Greta follows the climate activist as she travels around the world to convince world leaders to care about the ongoing climate crisis PERIOD

The film opens with audio of politicians denying climate change juxtaposed with visuals of forests burning cities flooding and storms raging preparing the viewer for the frustrating scenarios Thunbergwill face ahead PERIOD

The first half of the film is repetitive and quick and does not allow for much breathing room PERIOD Thunberg alternates between riding trains protesting and giving speeches seemingly exhausted with the process herself PERIOD

We have to continue to say the same thing over and over again until people get it Thunberg said in the documentary PERIOD

While it seems Grossmans pacing of the film was unintentional it is effective in highlightingThunbergs arduous crusade of attempting to make those in power to listen to her PERIOD

With shaky camera work haphazard editing and amateur cinematography the documentary itself is average at best PERIOD But what makes this film poignant and inspirational is Thunbergs own fortitude and empathy PERIOD

Thunberg makes the film worth watching and her courage alone is what makes the film impactful and awe inspiring an effect that would have been impossible without her PERIOD

From riding in electric cars taking trains and sailboats to eating a strictly vegan diet Thunberg constantly reaffirms her words are not empty and her message will always be backed by actions PERIOD

Although footage of Thunbergs speeches and protests make up the bulk of the film the most powerful scenes are when she is alone or with her father PERIOD In these moments we are able to break through the noise of the media politicians and crowds and finally see hernot as the leader of the youth climate movement but as a person PERIOD

In these scenes we see her surrounded by stuffed animals and lying with her dog laughing with her father baking a cake with her mother and dancing alone in a library PERIOD These few moments are shortlived but are breaths of fresh air in an otherwise emotionally overwhelming film PERIOD

Even as she sits alone on a sailboat with waves crashing around her and tears in her eyes because she misses her family Thunbergs resilience shines through PERIOD We see her nervous uncomfortable and fearful of the future but never intimidated or scared PERIOD

Oftentimes we place activists on pedestals and treat them as warriors who will save us all PERIOD We all too quickly forget that they are humansnot superheroesand they cannot hold the weight of the world on their own PERIOD Thunberg is no different PERIOD

Yes she is brave intelligent and inspirational but she is also a 17yearold girl with Aspergers who struggles with selective mutism anxiety and depression PERIOD

While Thunberg consistently reinforces that she is not the focus of the youth climate movement and that the crowds do not come for her but for the issues they are all fighting against the filmmakers seem to take the opposite stance and instead raise her pedestal even higher PERIOD

They make it seem as though Thunberg is the only notable climate activist and do not mention other youth leaders likeAnuna De Wever aBelgian climate activist and friend of Thunberg who is seen and heard throughout the film but never named PERIOD

The lack of focus or even acknowledgement of other climate activists degrades Thunbergs own ideology of equality and unity during the climate crisis and creates a conflicting narrative throughout the film PERIOD

The way Grossman misconstrues Thunbergs message by showing her as the sole leader and face of the climate crisis movement is inconsistent and confusing PERIOD Nevertheless I couldnt stop myself from getting goosebumps and feeling tears well in my eyes PERIOD

To watch Thunberg go from sitting alone outside parliament to having security guards surround her while she marches with hundreds of others all while carrying the same Skolstrejk Fr Klimatet sign was both heartwarming and heart wrenching PERIOD

As the documentary bombards us with the message that children will save the world Thunberg reminds us that they shouldnt have to PERIOD
