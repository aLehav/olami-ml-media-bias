Humanities Week returned from Oct PERIOD  to  with free online and inperson events around Virginia Techs campus PERIOD

Virginia Tech mens soccer fell to No PERIOD  North Carolina Wednesday night in the first round of the ACC tournament  a loss that puts the nail in the coffin on the Hokies season PERIOD

While most of spooky seasons special events have come to pass fall is far from over with plenty of fun festivities still in store for Hokies hoping to embrace all the season has to offer PERIOD Southwest Virginia hosts events and has natural beauty for students to enjoy with family friends or 

An open letter to President Sands

Search salaries of employees from Virginia Tech and other universities dating back to  PERIOD

Virginia Techs Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory team has exciting things lined up in their schedule this year with new robot developments and the honor to be featured on both PBS NOVA scienceNOW hosted by David Pogue and Through the Wormhole narrated by Morgan Freeman PERIOD The shows will recognize the teams various competitionwinning robots of RoMeLa PERIOD

The star of the show will likely be the Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence most commonly known as DARwInOP PERIOD With two consecutive victories at the international RoboCup Soccer competitions kid size humanoid league DARwInOP is a shining example of just one of RoMeLas many successes PERIOD

DARwInOPs big brother the Cognitive Humanoid Autonomous Robot with Learning Intelligence CHARLI2 is no slouch either PERIOD This robot is also a twotime consecutive champion of the RoboCup Soccer competition in the adult size humanoid league PERIOD

CHARLI is a fullsize humanoid its actually the United States first autonomous fullsize humanoid that walks Coleman Knabe a graduate researcher at the lab said PERIOD

Both DARwInOP and CHARLI2 have been in the spotlight for a while but RoMeLas other important projects are in the works PERIOD One of the upandcoming projects in the lab is the Shipboard Autonomous FireFighting Robot SAFFiR PERIOD

SAFFiR is intended to be a shipboard firefighting robot John Seminatore said PERIOD The goal of SAFFiR is to have a robot capable of autonomous decision making thats able to fight a fire and hopefully put it out. according to Seminatore the tour coordinator and graduate researcher at the lab ship fires are incredibly dangerous PERIOD He said that a ship simply isnt a place where a robot with tracks or four legs will be able to navigate because of the nature of bulkheads and the narrow staircases commonly found in ships PERIOD This is precisely why the Autonomous Shipboard Humanoid ASH the first robot in the SAFFiR project is a twolegged robot that will be able to use human equipment and navigate successfully inside of a ship PERIOD

RoMeLas history is full of success stories as well as a number of different projects which range from firefighting robots like ASH to projects like the Tripedal Hyper Altitudnal Legged Robot THALeR project which is an effort to build a 30foot tall threelegged robot PERIOD

Normally when youre controlling a robot it keeps itself balanced at all times Seminatore said PERIOD If you look at how robots walk its sort of a shuffle they are never off balance PERIOD When humans walk they push themselves forward and get offbalance. according to Seminatore the final goal behind the THALeR project is to create a 30foot tall robot that can serve as a mobile communication tower or observation post PERIOD The THALeR project is an attempt to change the ways in which robots move and to mimic the walking style of humans PERIOD This is very much in line with the labs research interests which include robot locomotion and manipulation as well as kinematics and mechanisms as stated on the RoMeLa website PERIOD

Our overall goal is to be able to make robots to help people and the movement of robots and having them be able to walk like people is a very big part of that Seminatore said PERIOD

RoMeLa is located in the basement of Randolph Hall and is comprised of three different facilities known as RoMeLa  RoMeLa  and RoMeLa  PERIOD Seminatore said that these areas house the various tools and working spaces that the researchers need to be able to design and fabricate the robots which are almost completely built inhouse PERIOD Only a few of the parts are directly purchased from outside manufacturers PERIOD Tours of the lab spaces are held by graduate students based on appointment for any people interesting in visiting the facilities PERIOD

According to Knabe the lab is made up of mostly graduate students with a selection of between  and  undergraduate volunteers PERIOD

We work long hours Knabe said PERIOD I think if you go in the lab at almost anytime of night or day there will be somebody working PERIOD Its not because Dr PERIOD Hong wants us to or because we have to but because once we get started on a project we really enjoy being there and getting work done. the researchers at RoMeLa reveal obvious dedication to advancing the field of robotics PERIOD This dedication and drive for success has caught the eye of more than just academics PERIOD The lab will be featured this fall in an episode of PBS science program NOVA scienceNOW. the lab will also appear in an episode of Through the Wormhole a science documentary show on the Science Channel sometime in the summer of  PERIOD

This isnt the first time that the lab has been in the media PERIOD Dr PERIOD Hong an associate professor and the founding director of RoMeLa was personally profiled in an episode of a Korean documentary television series known as Age of Global Success for the achievements of RoMeLa PERIOD

The Robotics  Mechanisms Laboratory is a huge part of the Virginia Tech community and represents the cutting edge of research in the field of robotics PERIOD Undergraduate students interested in joining RoMeLa can apply online with specific instructions for graduate students also available on the RoMeLa website PERIOD

RoMeLa is trying to bring robots to the point where they operate in a more humanlike fashion and can eventually help humans in the home and in the job environment Seminatore said PERIOD
