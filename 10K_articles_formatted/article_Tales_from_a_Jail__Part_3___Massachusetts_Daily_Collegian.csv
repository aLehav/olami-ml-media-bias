6035,2023-11-04,"a free and responsible press serving the UMass community since 

Over the past two days I have shared some of my experiences as a Decisional Trainer at the Hampshire County Jail in Northampton PERIOD Ive written about what it was like to work oneonone with an inmate what it was like to tour the jail and how my confidence grew during my time there until I was no longer afraid of the jail or the inmates Id met PERIOD

Yesterday I wrote about criminal justice issues that I came across during my time as a jail volunteer PERIOD I mentioned some of the hardships inmates face and that despite a wish to stay out of jail . million people in the U.S PERIOD are in jail each year more than any other nation in the world PERIOD While inmates are incarcerated our economy loses their productivity income tax and their incarcerations actually cost the U.S PERIOD more than   per inmate annually PERIOD My reaction to this is that we society may have failed these jailed men and women PERIOD

Over the years the field of criminal psychology has offered many theories to explain why people commit crimes PERIOD Simplified biological perspectives suggest our susceptibility to acting illegally is affected by our genes and brain processes PERIOD Psychodynamic theories generally say that criminal behavior comes from latent delinquency unconscious and unresolved issues from childhood PERIOD Social theories tend to argue selffulfilling prophecies if you believe youre bad you will be bad and family history of criminality create fewer inhibitions to antisocial behavior PERIOD And learning theories often claim criminal behavior comes from social learning and reinforcements PERIOD This list is by no means exhaustive but gives a basic idea of criminal theories PERIOD

But despite any psychological theory when it comes down to it the convicted individuals decision to pull out a knife when an argument got heated follow a friends lead to steal two plasma TVs from Best Buy or any number of similar scenarios is what landed him or her in jail PERIOD From the stories I heard while volunteering in the jail individuals convicted of a lowimpact crime in which the victim was not seriously injured often explain their decisions by saying they were caught up in the moment or that they simply had the misfortune to get caught PERIOD When asked they usually agree that in the seconds in which they committed the crime they werent thinking about how they wanted to go to college someday or how their relationships with loved ones might change or how they might not get to see their child for the years theyre in jail PERIOD

Almost always criminal intent and behavior does not arise spontaneously PERIOD It is marked by hyperactivity lying stealing noncompliance aggression and other destructive behaviors during childhood adolescence or young adulthood PERIOD When an individual perpetually has disruptive behavioral patterns there is a higher risk of future legal trouble PERIOD

Since the 1970s in the U.S PERIOD some prisons have offered rehabilitation services to inmates PERIOD The basis of these services was and is to intervene in disruptive behavior patterns of convicted individuals while they are incarcerated PERIOD In the best case scenarios these programs prevent inmates from committing further criminal acts upon their release PERIOD Still the programs dont prevent individuals from committing criminal acts in the first place PERIOD

Accordingly we can assume that Western societys main response to criminal behavior is reactive PERIOD But as Ralph Banay writes in his book We Call Them Criminals prisons have failed they do not reform the vicious and they do corrupt the otherwise redeemable. even having volunteered just  hours in a jail one semester this statement rings true to me PERIOD I think that if an individual labels himself or herself as a criminal and in a sense admits to belonging in a jail community he or she can easily lose hope for selfimprovement PERIOD In the Decisional Training program at the Hampshire County Jail created in  volunteers work to help inmates create possibilities for a better more hopeful future PERIOD

After an intense twoday orientation sitting in one room for about  hours collectively and learning about the prescribed decisional training material volunteers are essentially set loose to work with their assigned inmate PERIOD

According to the Decisional Training course there are five steps in good decision making PERIOD  The first is to see the situation clearly to isolate and define situations separate external events from internal feelings PERIOD The second is to know what you want to find a direction or specific goal you want to work toward PERIOD The third is to expand possibilities to identify alternative solutions to a problem and alternative ways of reacting PERIOD The fourth is to evaluate and decide to consider the risks probabilities of success and desirability of each option PERIOD The fifth is to act to monitor progress towards ones goal PERIOD Each of the  total sessions is structured to teach these skills to participating inmates and help them apply the skills in their own lives through use of worksheets and planned conversations PERIOD

At outset the Decisional Training Program seemed wonderful to me PERIOD It would allow me an undergraduate to act as a professional counselor for my inmate PERIOD And for the first two sessions I did follow the training material I had been given PERIOD But after a couple of weeks I was less interested in drilling the five steps into my inmates head and instead I took a more flexible individualized approach PERIOD While teaching my inmate about Decisional Training I gave him a space where he could process events going on in the jail think aloud about a better future and explore what he really wanted from life PERIOD It saddens me to think that most inmates dont get a chance to have this sort of emotional space while in jail presumably the time when they need it most PERIOD Only about  inmates participate in the Decisional Training program each semester for reasons unknown to me PERIOD

My change in approach working with my inmate reminded me of what Banay said about prisons not reforming the vicious PERIOD Although I cannot know if my more flexible approach to Decisional Training benefited the man I worked with there is also no public data to prove that the Decisional Training program works at all PERIOD There are strict rules around using prisoners as research participants for ethical reasons due to the fact that these individuals may not feel free to make a purely voluntary decision to participate or to not participate PERIOD

As such even throughout the nearly  years this program has been in existence Ive been told it has not been scientifically tested PERIOD

Theoretically speaking whos to say then that the Decisional Training program is not harmful to inmates Is there a reason UMass students are among if not the only undergraduates to be earning course credit for counseling in the U.S. i dont know the answers to these questions and I have no evidence to discredit the Decisional Training program PERIOD It seems like a worthy organization PERIOD Yet as a psychology student the fact that no research has been published on it bothers me PERIOD

Studies have been done however on how to best keep individuals out of jail PERIOD Research shows that one of the most effective ways to keep young adults the age group most likely to end up in jail out of trouble is to keep them in school PERIOD Being in school gets kids off the streets for seven hours five days a week and longer if they do their homework PERIOD  But also school can encourage hope goals and motivation for the future qualities that are not often associated with criminal behavior PERIOD

Individuals who graduate from high school without an otherwise thought are often immune to the difficulty it takes to keep someone not academically motivated from dropping out PERIOD But why endure high school if you dont see yourself going to college if youre failing your math class if you feel better smoking outside than sitting through classes with sports jocks Even the act of dropping out of school can be enough to lessen the selfworth felt by an individual making them more at risk for criminality PERIOD

Preventive programs across the U.S PERIOD have developed over the past  years to help students graduate from high school PERIOD In many school systems academic tutors and mentors are welcomed to work with struggling students in the hope that their academic performance will improve and their interest in education will increase PERIOD Success stories boast that with help even the least academically focused student can graduate PERIOD

Its not that getting kids to graduate high school will solve our jails overpopulation issues PERIOD  But for me at least its an area in which I feel we society can make the most difference PERIOD  The Decisional Training program at the Hampshire County Jail is potentially great PERIOD  But I would rather see crime rates decrease because of preventive programs than intervention programs PERIOD

In a time of economic turmoil and international crisis I know that domestic crime issues are on the back burner PERIOD Should the U.S PERIOD have the decency and good sense though to notice and act on its responsibility in reducing criminal activity without overpopulating jails we might see not only safer communities but a decrease in money spent keeping prisoners healthy and securely locked away PERIOD  Its true that the criminal was the one who made the decision to commit a crime but society was the one to let it happen PERIOD An ancient African proverb says that it takes a village to raise a child PERIOD  Doesnt it take a nation to raise a young adult

As the Coordinator of this program I must correct Ms PERIOD Owens assumption that she was essentially set loose following the Training Weekend PERIOD In fact both the volunteer and the inmate at the first session sign an agreement  the volunteer to teach skills and the inmate to participate PERIOD Further it is a serious misrepresentation of Decisional Training to write It would allow me an undergraduate to act as a professional counselor for my inmate. decisional Training is at core a teaching program PERIOD  When we use the helping process with another person naturally there is some overlap with counseling PERIOD  However no Decisional Trainer is a professional counselor. thank you Karen Banta Coordinator Decisional Training Volunteers

This is an interesting article the author went beyond simply arguing her conviction in an essay or discussing it among her friends she took her belief and supported it with action and than wrote about her experience

Although it is interesting she lists the various theories of criminal psychology and sees them as disparate yet they all rest on an underlying cause and that is those who commit crime exclusive of the ones with antisocial tendencies  do so because of their poor executive functioning PERIOD  This is further alluded to their lapse of reasoning when theyre committed a crime their lack of judgement and control PERIOD
   Many individuals who are in jail are because of petty crimes that arise out of poor executive control poverty or concurrently both PERIOD  In fact even the Decisional Training program may be an indication of this as I would surmise like any most attempts it is simply an attempt to reinforce to the prisoner what he should do what is right what the consequences of improper behavior is and how to correct it and how to ensure that mistake is not repeated PERIOD
   However the criminal is most likely aware of this as we all are and his failure to heed what is already known does not rest in his lack of knowledge or how to apply it but in those moments a lack of control PERIOD  So I think this should be recognized so if you want to prevent crime and similarly prevent recidivism you will need better methods PERIOD
   Also aside from executive functioning the other problem facing those who commit crimes is because of the communities that they live in and it would be important to look at crime not as simply an individual action but one that stems from community problems PERIOD  This is best stated in the theory ecology of crime PERIOD
   However to a certain extent this is recognized but its recognized poorly PERIOD  People think that community centers or silly community police relationships or other ways to motivate members in the community to be good essentially fail they have been tried in a variety in forms and hundreds of millions dollars have been spent on these program the past two decades PERIOD  They are ineffective PERIOD
     Also its not really a political problem being more accepting towards criminals or conversely being more strict with harsher sentencing is only addressing policy and those who execute that policy after the fact it does not address the root cause PERIOD  Most investigation and resources needs to be dedicated to the cause and once that cause is determined than can you correctly apply methods of reducing crime perhaps even abolishing crime PERIOD",Tales from a Jail: Part 3 – Massachusetts Daily Collegian,University of Massachusetts Amherst
