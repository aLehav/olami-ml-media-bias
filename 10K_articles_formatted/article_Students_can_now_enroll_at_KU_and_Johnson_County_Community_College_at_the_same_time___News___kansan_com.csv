The University of Kansas and Johnson County Community College have partnered to allow students to fully enroll at both institutions at the same time PERIOD

According to a news release from JCCC students can now take their core classes at the community college while taking more degreespecific classes at the University during the same semester PERIOD

Under this new partnership students will be able to utilize more academic programs and resources like tutors counselors and access to research centers PERIOD

This has been a studentdriven process rather than an institutiondriven process said Andy Hyland an assistant director of strategic communications for the University PERIOD Its about helping students be successful. hyland said he believes the institutions working together is vital in helping Johnson County transfer students stay on pace to graduate with a fouryear degree at the University PERIOD

Students who get almost all of their community college credits to transfer are . times more likely to earn a fouryear degree than those who are able to transfer less than half their credits Hyland said PERIOD

According to the JCCC website more than  percent of students enrolled in courses there say they plan to transfer to another college PERIOD

The partnership between schools is attempting to soften the transition in the trend of two years at a community college followed by two years at a larger university PERIOD

We listened to students who wanted to take courses at each institution when its best for them rather than the traditional and more rigid twoplustwo model Hyland said PERIOD

This new system is available to students now and Hyland said he believes this is a simple and effective way to help students make the most out of transferring PERIOD

It wasnt very difficult for us it just took coordinationWe have a good partnership and are familiar with each other so it wasnt very hard. edited by Maddy Mikinski
