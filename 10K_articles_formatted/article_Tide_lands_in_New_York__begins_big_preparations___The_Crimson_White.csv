7943,2021-03-13,"the Alabama mens basketball team touched down in New York City on Sunday in anticipation of its sixth National Invitation Tournament Final Four appearance Tuesday in Madison Square Garden PERIOD

Getting there two days early was strategic on head coach Anthony Grants part seeing as some of his team hasnt been to New York City before PERIOD

Well hopefully have a chance to give the guys some time where they can experience a little bit of New York he said PERIOD Basketball opens up a lot of opportunities for you to travel and experience things you wouldnt have a chance to do so certainly were going to try to take advantage of that as much as possible within the framework of making sure were prepared. the players realize the trip though exciting is more of a business trip than for pleasure PERIOD

Its going to be an exciting trip for me seeing as Ive never been said sophomore forward Tony Mitchell PERIOD But Ive still got one goal on my mind and thats winning the NIT championship. not only is being in the Big Apple a big opportunity but itll also be a big stage for the team to play in Madison Square Garden PERIOD

I think MSG is a big stage for anybody because everybody wants to play at Madison Square Garden when youre a little kid said freshman guard Trevor Releford PERIOD

Mitchell said Its a big stage PERIOD A lot of good teams play there PERIOD The Knicks still play there PERIOD Itll be a good test for us to go play. the teams opponent Colorado is averaging  points per game and is making about  percent of its field goals PERIOD The Crimson Tides defense has been holding its opponents on average to  points on  percent shooting PERIOD

The approach wont be any different Grant said PERIOD Well get prepared in terms of what we need to do offensively and defensively to have success against Colorados team PERIOD Theyre very explosive PERIOD Youve got some very explosive scorers that do a very good job and are well coached. releford whos from Missouri has seen one of the players before when he was in high school PERIOD Colorados Alec Burks is also from Missouri and competed against Releford throughout high school after the two played together for about five years PERIOD

Ive talked to him Releford said PERIOD Im looking forward to playing against him PERIOD He can score in any kind of way PERIOD Hes a tough defender too so hes going to bring it. earlier this year the team played in the Virgin Islands in the Paradise Jam Tournament PERIOD Releford said he believes having gone on a big trip for one tournament helped prepare the team for this tournament PERIOD

I think that trip helped us out a lot this year because we know when we get there were going to want to go out and stuff but you have to know its a championship so the rest of that can wait he said PERIOD

Grant said the trip may challenge his team to stay focused but that theyre aware of what they need to do to win PERIOD

I think our guys have been focused on that he said PERIOD They understand that this opportunity is one that we need to make sure were prepared for and do the best that we can to put ourselves in a position for that PERIOD I think were excited about it. the tipoff for the game against Colorado is at  p.m PERIOD with coverage on ESPN2 PERIOD","Tide lands in New York, begins big preparations â€“ The Crimson White",University of Alabama
