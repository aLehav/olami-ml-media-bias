If Ive spoken to you in the past two years there is a  chance I have mentioned the television show Crazy ExGirlfriend to you PERIOD It tells the story of Rebecca Bunch an unfulfilled attorney in New York City who happens to run into her first boyfriend on the street PERIOD She subsequently quits her job and moves to the suburban mecca of West Covina CA in an attempt to win his heart PERIOD However that doesnt even begin to grasp the emotional depth and skill behind this masterpiece of television PERIOD Ive completely fallen in love with it and was nervous to see how it would pull off its fourth  and final  season this year PERIOD Operating at such a high level and finding a satisfying conclusion can be hard PERIOD

However Crazy ExGirlfriend completely nailed it PERIOD Its final season was just as funny heartfelt musicallygifted and special as before PERIOD Its final two episodes left me utterly speechless PERIOD Over the course of four seasons Crazy ExGirlfriend tackled a number of storylines and themes from coming out to abortion to mental illness to womens sexuality PERIOD All were treated with incredible empathy and respect PERIOD Ive never seen a show that featured a character coming out as bisexual in the form of a massive song and dance number PERIOD Ive never seen a show that focused essentially on the main characters journey to loving herself and overcoming mental illness especially one that told her AntiDepressants Are So Not a Big Deal PERIOD Ive never seen a show that was so obviously created by and understanding of women PERIOD Crazy ExGirlfriend also truly nailed the concept of character growth PERIOD The show built a city and a cast that I completely cared about it gave even the smallest of characters a personality and a storyline and often a song as well PERIOD

Crazy ExGirlfriend was a unique special and innovative show PERIOD I feel lucky to have even been able to witness it PERIOD Ill miss you Rebecca Bunch PERIOD I hope youre thriving out there PERIOD

Since its full reveal at E3 in  Super Smash Bros Ultimate was at the forefront of my hype up until its release in December PERIOD Despite releasing at the halfway mark of the school year much of my first semester was spent speculating over who would be added as newcomers which made me keep up with the Nintendo Directs that showed off all the new stuff coming PERIOD Smash is a culmination of some of gamings biggest and longest running franchises and not just Nintendos either PERIOD The game is great both as a party game with friends and as a title to be competitive in PERIOD Through my classes in computer science and at some of the schools tournaments and meetups I have met a lot of cool people through Smash as well PERIOD Even as I dove deep into the competitive scene at UNC Charlotte with some intense singles tournaments I am continually reminded each time Im hanging out with friends that Smash is at its best when simply played as a group PERIOD

As a long time fan of the Tales of series I was looking forward to buying this new remaster of Tales of Vesperia. i finally got around to buying it during Spring Break and I was glad I played it this semester PERIOD Playing this game was a reminder of an amazing time period of JRPGs Japanese RolePlaying Games in the 2000s PERIOD This was the same era of games such as Tales of the Abyss Kingdom Hearts II and Persona . yuri Lowell is one of the best protagonists in the series PERIOD His snide yet caring personality was relatable that complemented an amazing cast PERIOD Combined with a solid story a great combat system and the iconic art style from Ksuke Fujishima Tales of Vesperia has quickly become one of my favorite video games of all time PERIOD

While I couldve just as easily put something like Avengers Endgame as one of the most impactful things I witnessed this semester as it surely was the first thing that came to mind was the band Hers PERIOD With the Liverpoolbased pop duo of Stephen Fitzpatrick and Audun Laading first piquing my interest last year when I stumbled upon their vibrant  singles Marcel and What Once Was I was introduced to yet another phenomenally dreamy pop group to follow along PERIOD It was in March of this year unfortunately that the duos musical talents were cut short as both Fitzpatrick and Laading as well as tour manager Trevor Engelbrektson were killed in a headon traffic collision in Arizona PERIOD With their sudden deaths I was encouraged to turn my ear to their music again PERIOD As their  sophomore album Invitation to Hers perfectly encapsulated the duos love for peculiar sardonic lyricism and offkilter craftsmanship Hers represents yet another budding talent taken from this world much too soon PERIOD Some of my favorite tracks include Harvey Breathing Easy and Speed Racer. arik Miguel

Every once in a while some piece of media will come along that stops me in my tracks and forces me to reassess my understanding of music or cinema PERIOD Yves Tumors  release Safe in the Hands of Love is a series of experimental songs that are fluid but at the same time incredibly abrasive PERIOD These songs are tied together by elegantly crafted threads but at the same time these songs are often decorated with ugliness PERIOD The first time I listened to this album I was left gasping for air I had never heard anything like this before PERIOD All of my preconceptions about music were ripped to shreds doused in gasoline and set aflame PERIOD Thematically the album deals with the concept of freedom but it is the albums freedom from music norms that has brought me back to it again and again and changed my understanding of what music can and should be PERIOD

Jeffrey Kopp

The zombie genre is nothing new PERIOD There have been countless takes on the undead over the years but people are still fascinated and moved by the dead rising and taking over the world PERIOD Back in January Netflix released Kingdom a zombie outbreak story set in Korea during the Joseon dynasty PERIOD As someone who loves history politics and zombies this was right up my fit and quickly became my favorite discovery of the year PERIOD It is terrifying gripping and emotionally powerful and is definitely worth a binge PERIOD
