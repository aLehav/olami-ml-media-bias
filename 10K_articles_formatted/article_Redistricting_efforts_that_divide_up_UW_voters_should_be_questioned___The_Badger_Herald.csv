Following the late release of the  Census Madison City Council members have been working on a redistricting plan to redraw the citys aldermanic districts PERIOD

Some of maps proposed in the city redistricting process threatened to split up District  which contains University of Wisconsin residence halls and UW student apartments PERIOD The district has been represented by a student or a recent graduate for many years PERIOD

Though the citys redistricting committee selected a map in the end that kept a majority of dorms and residence halls together it serves as an important case study for how redistricting can dilute the voices of communities PERIOD While this seems like a very straightforward issue it is actually extremely complicated PERIOD

What exactly is redistricting Redistricting is the process of drawing electoral district boundaries PERIOD The process occurs every ten years along with the national census PERIOD

Redistricting is important because the district lines determine where voters ballots are cast affecting which people they elect to represent them PERIOD It is also a process that is vulnerable to the corruption of gerrymandering which is the intentional manipulation of the redistricting process by people in political power to keep or change their political power according to the League of Women Voters PERIOD

Restrictive sex education bills create unnecessary divisionsAbout two weeks ago Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin introduced a bill that would require schools to notify parents and guardians Read

Gerrymandering can manifest in a multitude of ways PERIOD For example consolidating communities into one district would give the community only one representative in the legislature and dividing the community across districts can cause that community to be in the minority and in result inadequate representation PERIOD

These practices are known as packing and cracking respectively PERIOD Cracking and packing both refer to the specific ways of drawing legislative boundaries with the outcomes of elections in mind. gerrymandering is a very prevalent issue in Wisconsin specifically PERIOD InGill v PERIOD Whitford the plaintiffs argued that the Republican majority in Wisconsin used this strategy in the  redistricting process to maintain and bolster its majority in the state Assembly and Senate. in this context it is important to evaluate the effects the proposed maps could have had on the student voice PERIOD One of the concerns with the proposed map was that UW students would be inadequately represented if they were split up into different districts PERIOD Before forming an opinion on the proposed maps its necessary to examine the motivation behind splitting up students PERIOD

Data from the  census shows that Madison has grown  in the past decade to an official population of  PERIOD Districts are supposed to be as equal as possible so if the twenty council seats are divided equally then each district should have about  residents PERIOD

The redistricting committee hopes to be within  of that target number making each district fall between  to  residents PERIOD

Heightened student marijuana use could affect campus culture points to national trendA recent study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse showscollegeaged students in the U.S PERIOD are using marijuana at the Read

District  where a large student population resides has overgrown its allocated size PERIOD There are currently  residents in District  PERIOD So while it may seem ideal to maintain the current boundaries in order to keep representation as equal as possible District  must shrink PERIOD

According to city planner Ben Zellers it was possible to draw a boundary that includes all undergraduate residence halls but it could exclude other offcampus areas where students also live PERIOD The redistricting process is a push and pull PERIOD Thus there isnt a plausible situation in which everyone gets what they want PERIOD

The Redistricting Committee has now recommended Alder District Concept 7a which includes a lot of the residence halls and keeps together some of the off campus residences PERIOD Regardless students would be extremely represented in District  PERIOD

It seems like the committee is trying to split up the UW voting body simply as an act of practicality PERIOD There isnt malice in the act of dividing the students into separate districts PERIOD By the looks of it the committee is trying to work with the circumstances handed to them the circumstances being the overpopulation of District  PERIOD

There are many examples of gerrymandering in Wisconsin specifically racial gerrymandering which marginalizes the voices of minority groups already fighting to be heard and represented PERIOD Because of Wisconsins history with gerrymandering its understandable that students would worry it is occurring now in the redistricting process PERIOD

Though the recommended map includes most of the student population its always important to ask questions like why groups would try to split up the UW voting body in the first place PERIOD

Matters of representation and potential corruption should always be taken seriously PERIOD Students opinions in the redistricting process and the asking of these difficult questions show how bright students at UW are PERIOD
