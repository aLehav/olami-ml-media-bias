Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Cara DonfrioNovember  

Two years ago instructors at NIU taught using traditional means PERIOD Chalkboards whiteboards and overhead projectors were used to convey information PERIOD For the most part students found out their grades in class or by coming to an instructors office hours PERIOD

Former NIU provost Lynn Waldeland recognized that students needed a more efficient and technological way to interact with their classes PERIOD She organized a committee that researched several different Web portals that would allow students to check their grades get course information and otherwise interact with their classes online PERIOD From the list of those Web portal companies Blackboard emerged victorious PERIOD

Mertens shared that the biggest problem that students had with Blackboard wasnt with the Web portal at all but with AOL PERIOD

When AOL has problems it will time them out of Blackboard she said PERIOD

In previous semesters there had been technical glitches that wouldnt allow students to log on or to access information PERIOD This was annoying to many students but the problems for the most part have cleared Van Dijk said PERIOD

As glitches continue to be worked out and the system continues to advance perhaps in the near future the only blackboard in the university will not need any chalk  just a mouse and a keyboard PERIOD
