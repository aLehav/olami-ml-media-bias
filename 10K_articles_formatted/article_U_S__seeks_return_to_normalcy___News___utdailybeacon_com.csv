Even Weine and other experts arent certain how people should behave or feel now PERIOD

So audacious and violent were the Sept PERIOD  attacks that claimed more than  lives that psychiatrists say lessons learned from conventional war natural disasters and other terrorist incidents such as the Oklahoma City bombing do not neatly apply PERIOD

Complicating matters is the persistent dread of more violence when and where uncertain PERIOD Feeling safe both as a nation and personally has been shattered PERIOD Even everyday errands like going to the grocery store or dropping the kids off at school can be uns

ettling or seem pointless PERIOD

What you dont feel like is yourself PERIOD ASD can last days or weeks depending on your exposure to trauma PERIOD

The lengthy rescue and cleanup roundtheclock media coverage and the threat of more terrorist attacks just extends the recovery period therapists say PERIOD

 Manevitz said PERIOD
