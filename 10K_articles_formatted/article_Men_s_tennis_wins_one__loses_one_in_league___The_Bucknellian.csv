The mens tennis team defeated Colgate  on the road on Saturday before losing to Army  on Monday PERIOD Solid doubles performances as well as an outstanding match played by firstyearstandout Kyle Rosen  drove the Bison to their victory over the weekend PERIOD

Every spot in our lineup has a chance of winning their match Josh Katten  said PERIOD When youre playing tight matches its reassuring to look at the court next to you and see your teammate fighting hard for every point. starting whitehot all three doubles pairings defeated their Colgate opponents PERIOD Anton Kovic  and Evan Zimmer 13achieved the most impressive victory by defeating their competition  in the first doubles position PERIOD

Things became more interesting as the Bison were unable to convert victories from either of their top two singles players PERIOD Zimmer continuing his great play from his doubles match and Katten another doubles winner for the team both won their respective singles matches PERIOD

Finally Rosen bested his Colgate opponent in a grueling straight sets match to clinch the victory for the Orange and Blue PERIOD

Playing close matches at the beginning of the year have helped us tremendously PERIOD Now when were locked in a dogfight against Patriot League opponents we can look back at matches from earlier and be confident about our chances Kelly Morque  said PERIOD

Against Army Zimmer was the only Bisonto pull off a victory as he made quick work of his opponent at third singles PERIOD

The Orange and Blue were able to play some close matches against Army as Kovic and Rosen both took their opponents to tiebreakers but were unable to come out victorious PERIOD

The Bison will faceLafayette this coming weekendin Lewisburg PERIOD This will be the penultimate match before they make a run in the Patriot League Tournament PERIOD

I think that if we can focus on the little things before the upcoming tournament it will make a big difference Mark Malloy  said PERIOD Higher first serve percentages will apply more pressure on our opponents and getting our returns low and crosscourt will help us control the point. the weekly student newspaper of Bucknell University
