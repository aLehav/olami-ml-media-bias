Last updated March  at  p.m PERIOD

A Vanderbilt junior who was studying abroad in Florence has tested positive for coronavirus the student told The Hustler PERIOD The student who was part of the CET Florence program is back in the U.S PERIOD in a Chicago hospital with mild symptoms PERIOD The Hustler granted the student anonymity due to the sensitive medical diagnosis PERIOD

The student departed Florence on Tuesday after the program encouraged all students to return to the United States PERIOD Then the student tested positive for coronavirus the next day in Chicago PERIOD

The student told The Hustler that other Vanderbilt students in Florence had mild symptoms but medical facilities sent them back to their residences in Florence to quarantine without getting tested unless they had severe pneumonialike symptoms PERIOD This was to avoid exposing them to other patients in the hospital the student reported being told PERIOD

Now Im getting calls from the CDC every  minutes asking me every person Ive been in contact with and Im saying you know Im not the first person who was sick the student said PERIOD Its kind of like a massive coverup by the Italian government. people in the United States have also reported having trouble accessing tests for COVID19 PERIOD

On Wednesday the CDC widened its criteria for administering tests for COVID19 PERIOD Previously the CDC recommended only testing people who had recent exposure to a confirmed patient had travelled to a country with an outbreak or required hospitalization PERIOD The new standards allow clinicians to use their own discretion on testing symptomatic patients PERIOD

Universities including Columbia University and Stanford University have made the decision to suspend study abroad programs on March  PERIOD Vanderbilt told The Hustler in an email they will be releasing updates soon PERIOD Vanderbilt canceled study abroad programs in Mainland China and the Florence program was canceled Feb PERIOD  by CET PERIOD

COVID19 part of the coronavirus family originated in Wuhan China PERIOD Currently there are  cases worldwide and  deaths from coronavirus PERIOD The United States currently has  cases and  recorded deaths from the virus. the first coronavirus case in Tennessee was confirmed in Williamson County morning of March  the patient is a 44yearold man who is currently quarantined in his home PERIOD

Vanderbilt is working with infection control experts at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and local and state public health officials PERIOD The Vanderbilt Incident Response for Travel VIRT provides safetyrelated guidance and assistance for members of the Vanderbilt community on universityrelated travel PERIOD

At  p.m. Interim Chancellor Susan Wente sent an email to the Vanderbilt community about COVID19 updates included the reported case in Tennessee and a Vanderbilt student returning from Florence reporting to have tested positive PERIOD

Those who believe they may have been exposed to or infected with the novel coronavirus should seek medical care right away PERIOD Before you go to a clinic doctors office or emergency room call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms PERIOD Vanderbilt students should contact the Student Health Center while faculty and staff should contact the Occupational Health Clinic for further evaluation PERIOD

This article will be updated as new information becomes available PERIOD

The official student newspaper of Vanderbilt University

What university in Florence was this student at That would be helpful PERIOD

Agreed with Carla  PERIOD Another longtime resident in Italy here now in the US PERIOD The statement that its kind of like a massive coverup by the Italian government is childish and completely ludicrous just as it is to print it PERIOD Read todays article on NPR in which it is stated and has been stated elsewhere repeatedly Italy has carried out more than  tests for coronavirus  far more than any other European country. italy has been incredibly transparent about the situation there and are testing left and right PERIOD The program where this student was studying in Florence permitted students who were concerned to leave early when the CDC alert level was still at  and yet this particular student chose to stay knowing the risks PERIOD When the CDC alert reached  the program like many others in Italy closed down for the semester encouraging all students to leave PERIOD

It leads every person clicking the clickbait headline to believe that a student AT Vanderbilt has coronavirus stirring unfounded fears about an outbreak at the university itself PERIOD In reality the student was never at Vanderbilt during the infection process all Im saying is that its misleading PERIOD

I lived in Italy for a long time and this does NOT sound like Italian procedure and doubt this story is accurate PERIOD Id like to see their paperwork on their hospital visit PERIOD   Please dont feed peoples fears with exaggerated stories PERIOD

How exactly

This is a ridiculously misleading headline PERIOD",BREAKING: Vanderbilt student tests positive for coronavirus in Chicago - The Vanderbilt Hustler,Vanderbilt University
