I love Olehenriksons Sheer Transformation Moisturizer Roberts said PERIOD It always makes my skin feel super hydrated and refreshed without feeling too heavy. keeping up with this routine for about a year now Roberts used to use serums and toners but didnt notice a difference in her skin PERIOD

It didnt feel worth it to spend money on products that werent a necessity for me Roberts said PERIOD
