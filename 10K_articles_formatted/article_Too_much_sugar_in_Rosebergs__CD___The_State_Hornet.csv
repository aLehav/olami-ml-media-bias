The Rosenbergs new album Mission You is like praline ice cream PERIOD Its hard to like and most people would do fine without it PERIOD

How did the Rosenbergs get a record deal that allowed them to make a second album PERIOD

The first time I listened to this album it automatically lost points on originality PERIOD There are enough wannabe TheMonkees groups in America PERIOD Also it was a little tooshinyhappypeople for me PERIOD

Rosenbergs sound like a band that Cher would like from the movie Clueless starring Alicia Silvertone PERIOD A similarity to Weezer crossed my mind while listening to this album but at least Weezer had good lyrics PERIOD

With the Rosenbergs we have lyrics peppered with the three Cs corniness confusion and the sad fact that the lead singer can not sing PERIOD

The eighth track on the album called Fast Asleep is about the summer and how he missed it PERIOD The corniness factor comes in with the lyrics Girlsin the sun ants in the sand beach blankets she yells cuz hes in a band. it sounds too much like the Beach Boys PERIOD

The first track on Mission You is called Sucking on a Plum and frankly I do not know what the point of this song is and the confusion is set because the lyrics areStrange PERIOD If you and me have sex do we keep it all together I hear your dogs named Rex PERIOD Did you knit him a sweater Did David Fagin lead singer and writer for theband write these lyrics because they had meaning or did they rhyme and sounded neat I am thinking the latter PERIOD

Fagin did write one decent song on this album the last track titled Overboard. this song is about a woman that used a man and how the man wants her to decide if shewants to be with him PERIOD Fagins winning lyrics are Open up wide im overboard PERIOD Maybe I was just a novelty PERIOD Open up wide PERIOD You decide where you want to be. unfortunately there is something about Fagins voice that annoys me PERIOD He sounds like a cross between Liam Gallegher and an alien or a computerized voice PERIOD

All in all the Rosenbergs Mission You is not impressing PERIOD Like I said it is hard to like and most people would do fine without it I know I can PERIOD
