8339,2023-10-25,"moody Madness or Moody Magic PERIOD Either way SMU has made Moody Coliseum one of the toughest places in college basketball to play and with SMUs third win over a Top  team this season at home the mens basketball team is thinking about a NCAA tournament bid PERIOD



The Mustangs didnt just beat the No PERIOD  ranked Cincinnati Bearcats Saturday the team dominated them  in front of the fifth sellout crowd of the season at Moody PERIOD

If we didnt have a good team all wed have is a beautiful building SMU Head Coach Larry Brown said PERIOD I didnt imagine it would be like this quickly PERIOD But I was hopeful that we could get it that people wanted to see our team play and appreciate the fact that were playing hard and playing the right way. when the Bearcats pulled within seven midway through the second half two Nick Russell steals and a Nic Moore 3pointer highlighted an  run that put the game out of reach for Cincinnati PERIOD

Russell finished with  points three rebounds and three steals in a great team victory but it was his two key steals that preserved the win when it was gutcheck time for SMU PERIOD

When Nick got a steal and they didnt even try to run back with him I figured it was over Cannen Cunningham said PERIOD

In one of the best team wins of the year it was Cunningham stepping up with forward Markus Kennedy in foul trouble that was one of the reasons SMU went into halftime with a  advantage PERIOD

Cunningham had all  of his points in the first half and also added three rebounds and two steals on the game PERIOD Moore had  points and firstyear Ben Moore continued his impressive play added  points five rebounds and two blocks off the bench as well PERIOD

Russells big game was also highlighted by his impressive defense PERIOD Russell forced star Bearcats guard Sean Kilpatrick to shoot just five of  from the floor and even though he still scored  points Kilpatrick and the rest of the Bearcats took contested shots all night shooting just  percent as a team from the field PERIOD

Cincinnatis press defense did cause some trouble for SMU though forcing  turnovers by the Mustangs but SMU forced  turnovers by Cincinnati as well taking advantage by scoring  points off of turnovers PERIOD

Moody Madness is in full force and Coach Brown and the players credited the crowd for doing their part in the win but Brown said he knows the program needs to continue to improve to where the team and fans expect to win games like this PERIOD

Im so happy that we had that opportunity to storm the court Brown said PERIOD If we ever get the program the way we like well get used to winning games like this. it was crazy Cunningham said PERIOD Everybodys my best friend now. sMU is now  at home on the year and  in Moody and this win might just propel SMU into the Top  something not many people expected out of a team that won just  games a year ago PERIOD

At the beginning of the year we knew that we believed in each other but not a lot of people did Russell said PERIOD Im sure nobody expected us to be here PERIOD We knew what we had Weve got a great coach a great coaching staff  the skys
the limit. the  Mustangs have a few days off before heading to Rutgers Thursday for their second matchup of the year PERIOD SMU beat Rutgers  at Moody Jan PERIOD  PERIOD
