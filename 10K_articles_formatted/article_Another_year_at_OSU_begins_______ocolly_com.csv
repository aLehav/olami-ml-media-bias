For more than  years The Daily OCollegian has been publishing at Oklahoma State University PERIOD



And in that time it has grown to be one of the best college newspapers in the country PERIOD Graduates of OSU who have been a part of the OCollegian are highly sought after PERIOD





I encourage journalism majors in advertising public relations broadcast and newseditorial to come down and work PERIOD I also think it would be a good activity for those contemplating a journalism degree and even those who arent PERIOD





The experience that can be gained working at the OCollegian can lead to internships which in turn lead to jobs PERIOD





This summer current and former OCollegian staffers interned at The Indianapolis Star The Tampa Tribune The Tulsa World and others PERIOD





Graduates from OSUs Journalism Department have worked for the Associated Press in Las Vegas Tulsa and Oklahoma City PERIOD Former students have also found jobs at The Dallas Morning News The Denver Post The Daily Oklahoman and The Tulsa World just to name a few PERIOD





Staff members write design and photograph everything that is in the paper aside from Associated Press stories PERIOD





We took six staff members to the Houston Bowl two went to the NCAA basketball tournaments and two went to the NCAA Wrestling National Championship Tournament PERIOD





We also try to cover as many campus and community events as possible PERIOD Because of that we sometimes offend people either by not covering their specific event or by covering something unfavorable that has happened PERIOD But I can assure you we cover all news we find out about and consider newsworthy PERIOD





When we write a story it is done from only the most professional angle PERIOD It is neutral and not opinionated PERIOD



Students are held to the same high professional ethics and standards as career journalists PERIOD





We strive for accuracy and neutrality PERIOD However mistakes are inevitable PERIOD You will see corrections in this paper from time to time PERIOD





Is that because we are students No PERIOD Are those mistakes the result of carelessness or pure laziness No PERIOD Even the best papers require corrections PERIOD





I encourage student leaders to contact myself or the managing editor Holly ONeill if you have concerns about the coverage of your organization or if you have story ideas PERIOD





In the same way if you have a problem with our coverage or you perceive that the group you are involved in has been treated unfairly in anyway contact us PERIOD





We also hold daily editorial board meetings at  p.m PERIOD in the OCollegian offices in the Paul Miller building PERIOD



They are open to the public and we invite you to come PERIOD



The staff is excited this semester about the opportunity to improve upon our past experiences and continue the tradition at the OCollegian PERIOD
