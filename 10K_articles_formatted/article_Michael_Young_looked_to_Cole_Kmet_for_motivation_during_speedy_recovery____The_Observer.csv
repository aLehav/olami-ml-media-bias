Jack Concannon  Friday October  

Junior wide receiver Michael Young was drawing rave reviews from coaches during August camp PERIOD The native of St PERIOD Rose Louisiana caught just seven passes in  after transferring from Boise State but with Miles Boykin exiting the offense he was slated for a large role across from senior wide receiver Chase Claypool this season PERIOD Young credited his strong camp to a renewed focus on his own game and not worrying about others PERIOD

The coaching staff kept giving me that confidence PERIOD I was having fun PERIOD My first few years I took everything too seriously PERIOD I was worried about what the next guy was doing and not focused on myself and playing the game PERIOD This time around I was more focused on myself PERIOD My teammates were giving me confidence I was giving myself confidence Young said PERIOD I was having fun PERIOD I got back to that and Im in that place now PERIOD Im excited. then disaster struck with Young injuring his collarbone in midAugust forcing him to the sideline for the foreseeable future PERIOD Young acknowledged that it was pretty disappointing in the few days after the injury PERIOD

It was a little demoralizing PERIOD Just because you put in so much work for the game to be taken away from you  not intentionally it was a football play  things like that happen all the time he said PERIOD I think I had to put that into perspective as far as me not feeling as demoralized as I was. one source of hope for Young was tight end Cole Kmet PERIOD Kmet suffered a similar collarbone injury on August  and was able to post a dominant performance in his return against Georgia just over six weeks later PERIOD Once Young saw the quick progress Kmet was making it was easier to see a return to the field forthcoming PERIOD

Notre Dame wide receivers coach Del Alexander told me Well on the bright side its been a week and Cole is already catching passes. the whole time I was eyeing Cole PERIOD One week he was catching passes the next he was at practice and I realized this is not going to take as long as I think it is Young said PERIOD It went quickly from the first two or three days of being down and feeling upset to thinking Im not too far out here. youngs recovery followed a nearly identical path as Kmets with Young getting healthy about six weeks after the injury to take on Virginia PERIOD His presence gives the Notre Dame offense a downfield threat at wide receiver they did not previously have PERIOD Youngs . yards per catch last season keeps defenses honest forcing them to take players out of the box to help in deep coverage PERIOD While senior quarterback Ian Book and junior running back Tony Jones Jr PERIOD were likely excited to be able to share the offensive load with another player no one was more excited than Young himself PERIOD

Throughout the spring practices and into fall camp you work so hard to get that moment where you can finally play that first game of the season to go out there and have fun PERIOD To get injured and have to sit back for a while when I got out there against Virginia I cant even explain how I felt Young said PERIOD I was overwhelmed with emotion PERIOD I was so hyped and so amped I literally had to calm myself down PERIOD Normally Im one of the guys that I doesnt say much before games but last week it was full go from morning until the night. now that Young and Kmet are healthy the team waits for other playmakers like junior running back Jafar Armstrong and sophomore wide receiver Lawrence Keys III to return to health in the upcoming weeks PERIOD Young knows that if the offense can get everyone healthy and stay that way it is going to be tough to keep the Irish from scoring PERIOD

Its understood PERIOD Me and Jafar talked about it a couple times PERIOD I knew right away when Cole came back he was going to be a forced to be reckoned with I mean look at the guy hes a freak. young said PERIOD Jafar is as explosive of a player and as good of a back as Ive ever seen PERIOD I dont speak for myself but I just told myself when I get back I need to produce to the best of my ability. share This Story
