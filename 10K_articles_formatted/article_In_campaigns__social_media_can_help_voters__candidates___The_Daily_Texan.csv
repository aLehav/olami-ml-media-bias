Ethan Oblak  Daily Texan Staff

Today millions of Americans will head to the ballot box to make their voices heard PERIOD Like any other election they will head proudly home satisfied in fulfilling their civic duty once again PERIOD Eager to hear predicted results they will gather their family round the old boob tube and then  turn their attention promptly back to their respective smartphones PERIOD

If you think this sounds a bit unlike elections of the past you would be completely correct PERIOD The rise of the smartphone is certainly not something that happened overnight but its dominance is poised to have an extreme impact on this years midterm election in particular PERIOD Experts say  percent of Americans  more than double that of last election  now use smartphones for election coverage and almost  percent use social media to monitor their candidates of choice PERIOD This is a significant portion of voters one that aspiring politicians cannot afford to overlook PERIOD With the rise of shareheavy sites such as Facebook Twitter and even Instagram the statistics have sent our elected officials a message they cant miss When it comes to social media either get on or get out of office PERIOD

So why are midterm elections more susceptible to social medias impact than presidential races Why must we continue to belabor our sweet little thumbs scouring sites when teleprompted newscasters give us the exact same information The experts remain flabbergasted and unlike the expectations of their political counterparts their explanations cannot be condensed into a mere  characters PERIOD

Today people in the political world talk about having Twitter strategies but if you had talked about those things even in  you would have been laughed out of the room said Teddy Goff strategist and director of both of Obamas digital campaigns PERIOD It just wasnt part of the vocabulary. goff said he believes the biggest impact of social media is that it changes the role of the average voter. social mediaheavy campaigns offer access feedback and engagement to all citizens  not just the ones who can afford it by donating to campaigns PERIOD And though campaigns still seek to fulfill the same basic goals and objectives the rise in social media seems to ensure that those running for office are held to a higher and more stringent standard than representatives of the past PERIOD

These effects have certainly been felt in Texas gubernatorial election as both state Sen PERIOD Wendy Davis DFort Worth and Attorney General Greg Abbott the respective Democratic and Republican candidates for governor were under fire for several controversial choices on the campaign trail PERIOD Voters were outraged at Davis ad that insensitively highlighted Abbotts wheelchair confinement and others negatively reacted to a decision by the attorney general about the Texas Enterprise Fund PERIOD These slip ups may have gone unnoticed just four years ago  but now even the slightest sleight of hand cannot fly under the radar PERIOD

We feel that people want to have a sense of being connected Goff said PERIOD Its important to voters  to have a sense of being inspired in what they were participating in. in fact many voters prioritize social media for its reliability. a whopping  percent say they are likely to rely more heavily on these types of political outreach and enjoy avoiding the filter of larger news networks PERIOD

And even for politicians the benefit social media brings to a campaign cannot be overlooked PERIOD You get to represent your own message said Peter ChowWhite associate communications professor at Simon Fraser University PERIOD Youre not framed by any media outlet whatsoever PERIOD And you have a direct line to voters  It provides great opportunity in a campaign. it seems that our representatives embrace this form of communication as much as we do  and they are certainly better politicians for it PERIOD Social media removes the barrier between politicians and the electorate and it can interact inform and engage more candidly in ways that were previously impossible PERIOD

So this election day head to the ballots with your head held high and your smartphone in hand PERIOD And as you hear the satisfying pop of the Twitter feed refreshing itself rest assured that many miles away there is a devastatingly hopeful formallyclad candidate who is very likely doing the same PERIOD
