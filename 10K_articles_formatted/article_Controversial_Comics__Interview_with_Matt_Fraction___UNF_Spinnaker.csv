Interview with comic book writer Matt Fraction

From doing the impossible by popularizing Hawkeye from The Avengers to creating an Eisner award winning comic about people who have magical powersSex Criminals Matt Fraction has become one of the most recognizable names in the comic book industry PERIOD He has been credited in movies such as the first Thor and is currently working on a television adaptation of Sex Criminals PERIOD Thanks to his unique writing voice hes stood out among other writers pushing comics to genres and topics that are not usually discussed in the medium PERIOD

However helping pave the way for mainstream comics comes with some backlash PERIOD

Back in September the Thomas Carpenter Library on campus listed novels and graphic novels under attack with Sex Criminals being on that list PERIOD Apple banned the comic and then unbanned it on their store for the comics mature content specifically about whats right there in the title sex PERIOD

Aside from the fantastical and supernatural elements of the comic the story covers a wide range of all things to do with human relationships PERIOD From the awkwardness of going through puberty to relationship issues to different sexual orientations the tale brings something that everyone can relate to PERIOD This has made it not only an important comic but an important piece of media in discussing topics openly that the majority discuss either privately or not at all PERIOD You can hear Matt Fractions thoughts on his topical comic as well as the experiences hes had as a writer throughout his years in his interview on our podcast here PERIOD
