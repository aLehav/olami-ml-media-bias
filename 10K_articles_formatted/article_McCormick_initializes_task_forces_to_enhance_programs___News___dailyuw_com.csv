McCormick initializes task forces to enhance programs Jen Sullivan Daily Staff

UW President Richard L PERIOD McCormick has called for an indepth focus on how interdisciplinary approaches can be applied to enhance international and environmental studies programs.The concentration on the two programs was begun by former UW President William P PERIOD Gerberding and has been carried even further by McCormick.McCormick has formed a yearlong task force made up of students faculty and community members for each program PERIOD McCormick said PERIOD Both task forces will begin meeting this month.Both have been given a spring deadline for reporting their recommendations to McCormick PERIOD The recommendations are to cover how students and faculty as well as those outside the University involved with either international or environmental studies can best be served PERIOD said Susan Jeffords chair of the task force on international studies.Both task forces have been urged by McCormick No two areas of the University curriculum cross more departmental school and college boundariesWe have no assigned budgetWe might at some point invite in some outside consultants but right now its all just a devotion of time to put the University in a better position to improve interdisciplinary education.When the administration eliminated the Institute for Environmental Studies the environmental task force was promised to those involved in environmental studiesI would like to see the task force create specialized majors in environmental studies PERIOD Since it is hard to turn these majors into specified degrees I think that a main focus of the task force should be how to do this. copyright   The Daily of the University of Washington
