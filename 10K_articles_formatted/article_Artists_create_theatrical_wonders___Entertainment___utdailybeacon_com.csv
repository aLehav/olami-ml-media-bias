Putting on a quality theatrical production requires the hard work and

dedication of many people PERIOD Unfortunately one aspect of the production is

often overlooked the people who work backstage to make each performance

possible PERIOD

A lot of effort goes into turning the directors vision of the set and

costume into reality PERIOD Plans must be drawn up and then the actual set must

be built all within a specified time period and budget PERIOD Robert Coleman

technical director takes the set designers vision and then implements it

into reality PERIOD This involves both understanding the play and what the set

designers are trying to achieve PERIOD

After looking at the drawings Coleman breaks down the set into its basic

elements and estimates the time and cost it will take to create each piece PERIOD

A typical production has a budget of  and takes about  hours to

create PERIOD This process must be repeated for the eight shows the department

averages each year PERIOD

Coleman says the most enjoyable part of his job is problemsolving and

working with students and highquality staff PERIOD

 he says PERIOD 

Costume designer and graduate student Allison Steadman works intently sketching a classy design for actors costumes

He also says that theater has something to teach PERIOD



After the drawings are created and the director approves them they are

sent to Marty Cooke cabinet shop supervisor who then constructs

them PERIOD

Cooke is in charge of turning the design into reality PERIOD It takes about five

weeks to build the entire set PERIOD The construction crew must use many

technical concepts in their construction PERIOD They must build safe and secure

sets yet use the least amount of material possible PERIOD In fact sometimes the

assigned tasks are impossible to create so the plans must be redrawn PERIOD

After the crew receives the designs they sit down and make sure that the

set can be constructed within the budget then they divide up the work PERIOD

Actual construction begins two weeks before the show and it takes three or

four days to install PERIOD

The one thing that Cooke says he likes the best about the theater is the

fact that it changes PERIOD Every show is different and the work requires

different approaches PERIOD

 Cooke says PERIOD

Another important aspect of the theater is costume design PERIOD The costume

designer must research the play come up with a design concept discuss the

preliminary sketches with the director and then create the final

rendering PERIOD

The costumes come from a variety of sources PERIOD Sometimes they are built they

can be bought or they can be pulled straight off the shelf depending on

the design PERIOD

Typically each designer has one or two big projects each year plus several

inclass designs PERIOD Costume designers are in charge of everything that the

actors wear from accessories to shoes to makeup even the way they

arrange their hair PERIOD Because the costume designers are graduate students

they do not have the time to do more than two projects during the year PERIOD

Each play has several students working in costume usually about three

graduate students and a handful of undergraduates PERIOD

Working in costume allows contact with the actor something many other

backstage people do not get to do PERIOD

 says Allison Steadman graduate student and

costume designer PERIOD

Steadman says the design really depends on the show and the director PERIOD Each

director is different and has different visions of what he or she wants the

audience to focus on PERIOD

 Steadman says PERIOD
