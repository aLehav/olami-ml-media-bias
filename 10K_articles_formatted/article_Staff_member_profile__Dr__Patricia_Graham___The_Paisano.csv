Dr PERIOD Patricia Graham did not think she would stay with UTSA for four decades PERIOD The hundreds of framed memories wooden plaques on her dustless shelves and symbolic quilt of prints and quotes from former Ambassadors all speak otherwise PERIOD

You dont think that you would do anything for  years said Graham PERIOD But I am stimulated by the university environment PERIOD There is just so much going on. before UTSA Graham taught at St PERIOD Marys University where her relationship with the dean of students was crucial for her career at UTSA PERIOD

We were very good friends  it was just us two with another woman teaching said Graham PERIOD When UTSA opened they asked her to be in charge of student activities PERIOD She asked me to come too and Ive been here ever since. graham started at UTSA in October  a time when the university was located at the Koger Center on  and Babcock then she transitioned to the Main Campus in  PERIOD Having earned her Ph.D PERIOD in Curriculum and Instruction through the College of Education at the University of Texas at Austin Graham worked as the director of testing PERIOD

Back then we had only graduate students no undergraduates recalled Graham PERIOD Only the MH building and a PE building were built PERIOD We had a bookstore but no books PERIOD Thats how we started but we have grown and grown. in  the Registrars Office formed an organization that would later be called UTSA Ambassadors PERIOD

The registrar needed some people to give tours recalled Graham PERIOD They got  or  but these students didnt do as much touring as they did filing documents in the office. following the entrance of Samuel Kirkpatrick as the new UTSA President in  the UTSA Ambassadors grew PERIOD

Along with the president we also got a new VP of student affairs who had worked in other schools where the concept of ambassadors existed remembered Graham PERIOD She went to the president and said I want to take over the UTSA Ambassadors and he said OK. She called me and asked if I wanted to be the adviser  here I am today. graham has served for  years as the adviser of the UTSA Ambassadors PERIOD As the current executive director for student activities Graham claimed she has much contact with many students. uTSA Ambassadors consist of over  student leaders who host campus events universitysponsored conferences and community and alumni functions PERIOD They provide more than  service hours to the university annually PERIOD

Ive got the best job in the world and I revel in the diversity here said Graham PERIOD My passion is to work with students who are excited about something  getting accepted to medical school for example PERIOD When they are excited I am excited and feel part of their success. on Oct PERIOD  Graham welcomed the UTSA Ambassadors to their twenty-fifth Reunion Luncheon PERIOD Current ambassadors offered tours of the campus to their predecessors while Graham proudly held the youngest member a 4weekold baby boy who attended the event with his parents PERIOD

I absolutely loved the reunion said Graham PERIOD   I enjoy seeing how much the ambassadors have succeeded yet they are still really nice people. grahams dedication to the university has been recognized multiple times PERIOD She has been a recipient of Amber awards University Life Awards and the Roadrunner Award PERIOD Her biggest recognition however comes from her students PERIOD
