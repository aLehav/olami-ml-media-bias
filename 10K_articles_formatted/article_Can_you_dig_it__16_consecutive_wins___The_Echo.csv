With a clean sweep against Occidental on homecoming night the Regals extend their winning streak to  games and havent lost a conference game in over two years

Homecoming brought many exciting events to the California Lutheran University campus but one of the highlights of these events was the womens volleyball match against Occidental College on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD The Regals wiped out the opposition by sweeping three sets solidifying the teams twenty-first win of the season out of  matches PERIOD

The team played in front of a crowd of  people who collectively drowned out the stadium with sounds of enthusiasm for the rousing match PERIOD

Every moment of the game was really exciting especially because we had a huge crowd here with a lot of energy which made it awesome freshman setter Jamie Smith said PERIOD

The first set put the Regals in front with several opening kills from the team that left the Tigers in the dust PERIOD The successful dynamic of the Regals put a lot of pressure on the Tigers who took advantage of all the timeouts they could get in the game PERIOD However this tactic proved unsuccessful for the Tigers when the Regals won the first set by a margin of  PERIOD

The Tigers upped their game in the second set starting off with three straight kills that put the Regals behind PERIOD This did anything but stifle the gameplay of the Regals who held their own throughout the match PERIOD The set had several points where the teams were tied and the outlook of the set could go either way PERIOD

There were four very long rallies throughout the match three of which the Regals scored on some of them by a slim margin PERIOD With the pressure mounting the Tigers found themselves utilizing both of the allotted timeouts to help the team find its way to a win PERIOD However with the prowess of the Regals along with several effective kills and blocks the home team won out with three points in their favor PERIOD
