Momotaro is located on West College Ave in State College PERIOD

In no way am I a bubble tea expert PERIOD

Those who come from countries where bubble tea originated are probably the ones you should go to for bubble tea suggestions PERIOD

But I am in fact a bubble tea fanatic PERIOD Ever since I tried my first taste of the boba in milk tea in high school I was hooked PERIOD

If you are not familiar with this special tea the typical option is a milk tea with small tapioca balls bubbles inside the tea PERIOD However these bubble tea stores often offer more drink selections than just milk tea PERIOD

Milk tea has always existed in East Asia but it was Taiwan where the boba culture started in the late 80s and early 90s PERIOD

State College has four stores that specialize in boba tea  Momotaro Caf Wow Kung Fu Tea and the temporarily closed Little Food Court PERIOD

A Bangkok Tea fromMomotaro in State College PERIOD

The store Momotaro on College Avenue was my first introduction into State College bubble tea PERIOD

I have always been a fan of Momotaros traditional taro tea and the supply of Asian treats PERIOD

Also the store ambiance before the coronavirus was always so adorable and filled with plushies and notes from guests PERIOD

For this trip I got a tea I havent tried the Bangkok Tea which is Thai tea and condensed milk with boba PERIOD I did not expect its bright orange color which I later learned was the food coloring in Thai tea bags PERIOD This made sense as it tasted like a typical black tea with bubbles PERIOD Theres definitely nothing wrong with that PERIOD

Taro where Momotaro gets its name from is a starchy root vegetable which was a surprise for me PERIOD I imagined all teas came from herbs or fruits PERIOD Nevertheless it is delicious PERIOD I believe this is the best starter bubble tea to try PERIOD

A taro milk tea with bubbles and a passion tea with lychee jelly and bubbles from Caf Wow in State College PERIOD

Next I tried a store Ive passed many times but never actually stopped in Caf Wow PERIOD Here I had two drinks my past favorite taro milk tea with bubbles and the new option of passion tea with lychee jelly and bubbles yes I wanted both PERIOD

I loved the lychee jelly which is a clear fruit that is condensed into small jelly rectangles PERIOD I actually preferred this drink more as a refresher with the passion fruit and jelly PERIOD I think this will be a new favorite drink of mine PERIOD

Caf Wow is a cute store with a sort of underground outdoor seating  I would definitely enjoy doing work here on a nice sunny day PERIOD Caf Wow also had fun Oreo smoothie drinks and brown sugar milk which would be interesting to try for a desertesque drink PERIOD

Cassandra Kidwell holds a Passion Green Tea from Kung Fu Tea in State College PERIOD

The third store Kung Fu Tea is very close to Momotaro on Beaver Avenue PERIOD I found many similarities between the two stores PERIOD

Both have many different addin options like bubbles nata jelly herbal jelly mango jelly and mashed taro PERIOD Kung Fu Tea especially focuses on how all drinks are customizable PERIOD

At Kung Fu Tea I got another passion green tea but this time with aloe jelly PERIOD The aloe jelly intrigued me as Momotaro also had it but listed it as healing jelly. the taste was surprisingly good and amazed me that the jelly was made from the same aloe plant I use at the beach PERIOD

I enjoyed that many of Kung Fu Teas included nondairy milk as many of Momotaros milks come with condensed milk or milk with the water removed as milky as milk gets PERIOD

All three of these stores add an innovative cultural touch to State College PERIOD Im glad our town gets a taste of these teas that offer something different than the many coffee shops around PERIOD
