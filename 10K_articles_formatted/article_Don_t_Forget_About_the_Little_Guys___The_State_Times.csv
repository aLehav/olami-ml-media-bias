Editorial Opinion


With the recent spread of the coronavirus COVID19 most companies have coordinated with their employees to work from home in hopes of limiting the exposure to and transmission of the virus PERIOD This is a great way to continue paying employees while also getting valuable work done and further limiting inperson contact PERIOD However not everyone has this luxury of being able to work from home in their pajamas next to their pets PERIOD Most local business owners put their hearts and souls into their work yet cannot afford to keep their doors open as customer counts drastically decrease PERIOD COVID19 seems to have made the general public believe they should stockpile anything and everything they can get their hands on in case of a mandatory twoweek quarantine period PERIOD What people seem to forget is that there are other options to help you and your local business owners make the most of this pandemic PERIOD

One of the things that helps me to personally relax during stressful situations is takeout food PERIOD Although you may not be able to sit down at a restaurant delivery options are still available in most New York State locations until  p.m. PERIOD Takeout is a great way to get good food and support local businesses at the same time PERIOD If you are worried that contact from a delivery driver could put youor themat risk of infection there are options to pay in advance and ask your driver to leave your food on your doorstep PERIOD Right now paying with a card is better than cash anyway when it comes to limiting exposure PERIOD

Most food delivery companies such as DoorDash Uber Eats and Grubhub have offered free delivery charges from local eateries to promote takeout  for those under quarantine PERIOD This is a great way to still enjoy Chinese takeout as Chinese restaurants are one of the most negatively affected businesses due to prejudice as a result of the virus originating in China PERIOD In response to these concerns many Chinese restaurants have been going to extra lengths to assure their customers of their cleanliness PERIOD They have also been reminding customers that they follow sanitation rules have not recently traveled to affected areas and know to stay home if they are feeling sick PERIOD These business owners are trying to fight the racial prejudices they have been facing in light of the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD In this time of panic it is essential to be kind to your neighbors and others you may encounter that share similar fears and anxiety PERIOD

Another great way to support local businesses while still remaining in the comfort of your own home is to partake in online shopping PERIOD Many small businesses have websites for you to browse and have your favorite items delivered to you in a timely manner PERIOD While you may not be able to peruse through your favorite local boutique you can still enjoy a similar experience with a computer and some patience PERIOD

The development of the coronavirus pandemic has scared nations of people making them anxious for what the future might hold PERIOD Dont let that stop you from taking the time to destress with some good food and shopping Consider supporting the small businesses in your community first and we will all get through this together PERIOD
