Updated November     pm





University of Montana forward Dischon Thomas plays defense against Weber States Dillion Jones in a Jan PERIOD  game at Dahlberg Arena PERIOD The matchup ended in a  loss for the Grizzlies PERIOD

Dischon Thomas has been an Xfactor for a Griz basketball team looking for redemption after a firstround exit in the Big Sky Conference tournament last year but his journey didnt start in the Garden City PERIOD

Thomas is one of Montanas best scorers this season at . points per game and has been one of two integral transfers during this season notching his two hundredth point for the Griz last Thursday in a loss to Weber State PERIOD

Its been great Thomas said PERIOD I loved it out here PERIOD Its pretty chill for the most part PERIOD Im kind of a laid back guy so just the citys been nice and everywhere I go people are nice and theyll recognize me from basketball. the Durham North Carolina product played high school ball in Phoenix Arizona where he averaged doubledigit points and rebounds PERIOD His collegiate track started with a commitment to Nevada before eventually committing and signing to Mountain West rival Colorado State PERIOD

At CSU he played a major role among a stacked roster featuring guys like future NBA player David Roddy PERIOD Starting nearly every game in his junior year he averaged just under six points per game while shooting  from both the field and 3point range PERIOD

His final game at Colorado State would signal the end of a tenure in Fort Collins that saw Thomas score a team high of  points against a stout Michigan squad in the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

This strong showing would put him on the map as he took off for the transfer portal eventually finding a home at UM along with a familiar face PERIOD

Thomas brother Dorell is a freshman guard for the Griz PERIOD The brothers played together during their time at Hillcrest Prep PERIOD Dorell showed major strides as a young prospect averaging nine points for a strong prep program in the western United States PERIOD

Dischon and Dorell played together at Hillcrest only for one season and once Dischon graduated Dorell moved on to Skyline Prep in Phoenix Arizona where he eventually graduated PERIOD

Its crazy Thomas said PERIOD Like sometimes Im in the moment so I dont realize like wow my brothers like really here with me PERIOD But for the most part I love it PERIOD I get to see him grow as a person. the 22yearold Dischon has moved around from the basketball city of Durham to the bright lights of Phoenix and now all the way up to Missoula leagues smaller and farther from everything he has known PERIOD

But even in Fort Collins Dischon found a way to fit in PERIOD And in Missoula it is hard not to be welcomed when you play for one of the states premier collegiate basketball teams PERIOD Along with senior guard Aanen Moody he has been a part of a stout group of transfer athletes who have helped pull off major wins both in and out of conference play PERIOD

UM has been on and off this season with a  record in conference as of Jan PERIOD  but Dischon has contributed in almost every game he has played PERIOD He had a highlight performance against conference rival Eastern Washington when he notched his first 20point performance with Montana while knocking down four threepointers and grabbing four rebounds PERIOD

We got a lot of new guys including myself coming in PERIOD So its been a little bit of adjustment a little bit of up and down Dischon said PERIOD But for the most part were coming together and were gonna be better moving forward. the new Grizzly is among many new faces on a team that lost eight players in the offseason PERIOD Head coach Travis DeCuire said the group has had problems practicing together due to injuries keeping some players sidelined PERIOD But Dischon has played and started every game this season PERIOD

Hes an incredible young man that is very selfless Decuire said PERIOD At the end of the day hes of the few that you can actually look in the eye tell the truth whether its something he wants to hear or not PERIOD He soaks it inand guys like him are the ones you wanna see be successful. montana will face off against the instate rival Montana State Bobcats on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD The team is currently sixth in the Big Sky with a  record PERIOD
