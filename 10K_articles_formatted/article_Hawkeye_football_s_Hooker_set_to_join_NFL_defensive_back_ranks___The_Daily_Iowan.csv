Iowa defensive back Amani Hooker intercepts a Maryland pass during a football game between Iowa and Maryland in Kinnick Stadium on Saturday October   PERIOD The Hawkeyes defeated the Terrapins  PERIOD

Adam Hensley Pregame Editor April  

The Iowa football program has a longstanding history of churning out defensive backs for the NFLas scouts and general managers at the next level are well aware PERIOD

Since  five Hawkeye defensive backs have been selected in the NFL Draft Jordan Bernstine and Shaun Prater in  Micah Hyde in  Desmond King in  and Josh Jackson last year PERIOD

Hyde earned a trip to the Pro Bowl in  and then this past season King earned firstteam AllPro PERIOD Point being Hawkeye defensive backs are no strangers to success in the NFL PERIOD

Next in line to carry on Iowas tradition Amani Hooker PERIOD

There are a lot of guys who arent even in this position who would love to be in my spot he said PERIOD Im having fun with it. while hes not projected as a firstround pick Hooker  a Minneapolis native  has captured plenty of attention after a stellar  campaign PERIOD

Hooker was named the TatumWoodson Defensive Back of the Year in the Big Ten and earned secondteam AllAmerican honors from both the Associated Press and USA Today after his first season as a fulltime starter PERIOD

In  games Hooker notched  tackles . for a loss and  sack defended  passes and intercepted  passes PERIOD He also recorded a safety PERIOD On top of that playing as a linebackersafety hybrid Hooker displayed prime versatility  which makes NFL scouts take note PERIOD

RELATED NFL Draft Profile Anthony Nelson

Hes a hybrid safety with an advanced feel for play design and recognition of where the ball is going and how to play it NFL analyst Lance Zierlein wrote on NFL.com He could thrive in a robber role or as a big nickel where he can match up against passcatching tight ends PERIOD Hes not twitchy fast or fluid and has some limitations in man coverage however he has the size instincts and ball skills to become a plus starter but needs to find his perfect scheme fit. on top of his third season with the Hawkeyes Hooker performed well at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis PERIOD He ran a . 40yard dash recorded  reps on bench press and jumped  inches vertical and  broad PERIOD

Those are my expectations for myself  I have really high expectations for myself especially at the Combine he said PERIOD The times I got I was expecting better times than that PERIOD I know some people didnt have me running that fast jumping that high or whatever. zierleins article reacting to Hookers Combine performance also included a quote from an anonymous AFC defensiveback coach  someone who had high praise for the  210pound safety PERIOD

Eyes instincts I love all of that the coach said PERIOD Hes not fast but you can scheme around it and hes going to cover up some of it with how he sees the game. recently NFL.coms Chad Reuter predicts Hooker will go to Minnesota in the second round with pick No PERIOD  PERIOD Pro Football Focus has Hooker going in the second round to the Indianapolis Colts at the fifty-ninth pick CBS Sports projects him as a thirdround selection to Kansas City ninety-second and a  Sports mock draft had him going at No PERIOD  to the Los Angeles Chargers PERIOD
