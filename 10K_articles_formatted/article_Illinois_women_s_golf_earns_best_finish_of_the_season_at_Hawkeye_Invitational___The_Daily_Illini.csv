2489,2023-10-26,"entering the Hawkeye Womens Invitational the Illinois womens golf team thought it had a good chance to get a firstplace finish PERIOD Although they didnt take first the Illini still managed to place near the top of the leaderboard with a secondplace finish at the Finkbine Golf Course in Iowa City Iowa PERIOD

We put ourselves into position to win in the final round head coach Renee Slone said PERIOD Missouri State played really well Sunday PERIOD We just didnt come out as sharp as we needed to

Despite not having a topthree individual finisher Missouri State came out on top with a 50overpar  four strokes ahead of the Illini PERIOD Although Illinois had its best finish of the year it was the teams worst score this season PERIOD The reason for the high score could have been the play of the greens PERIOD

The greens were unpredictable said sophomore Hailey Koschmann who finished tied for nineteenth with a 20overpar  PERIOD If you were above the hole there were some things you couldnt stop PERIOD You had to place it on the green in a good spot to have a good chance. slone also noted the difficulty of the greens and added the weather which was  degrees at the start of Sundays final round could have had an impact on the scores PERIOD

This tournament was a great learning experience for us Slone said PERIOD Going into the final round tied for the lead was exciting PERIOD We have to learn how to get the job done and finish strong. before the next tournament Slone wants the team to work on its short game and on reaching the green when it is inside  yards PERIOD The main goal she has for the team is to become more comfortable and to strive to shoot under par instead of just settling for bogeys PERIOD

Two Illini golfers stood out in the tournament PERIOD Junior Raquel Hopton the only player on the team to finish a round under par and sophomore Kaitlyn Wampler both tied for second at 10overpar  PERIOD Sophomore Katelin Dilger tied for fifteenth place with an 18overpar  PERIOD

Overall I think I put out a few good scores that contributed to the team Dilger said PERIOD But I definitely left a few strokes on the course.",Illinois women's golf earns best finish of the season at Hawkeye Invitational - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
