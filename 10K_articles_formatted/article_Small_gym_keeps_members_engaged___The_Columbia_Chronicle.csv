There are no television screens for entertainment while working out no one listens through headphones and everyone is greeted at the door by their first name PERIOD This place has the earmarks of a local fitness center struggling to keep members away from bigger and more prominent gyms inChicago but it isnt PERIOD

LA Boxing which has four locations in the Chicagoland area is a gym that features boxing kickboxing and mixed martial arts training PERIOD Inside the place resembles a classic boxing gym with a ring weight bags and training area PERIOD

Unlike other gyms based on membership fees and marketing with flyers advertisements and promotions LA Boxing relies on search engines to get recognition PERIOD

David Sutor manager of the  E PERIOD ninth St PERIOD location said he doesnt have a problem with advertising because his gym is one of the first listings seen on a Google or Yelp search because it increases exposure PERIOD

Sutor said while the popularity of MMA helped attract members in the early years its the boxing and kickboxing that have given the company more opportunities to open other locations nationwide PERIOD He said MMA accounts for  to  percent of LA Boxings profits PERIOD

Additionally he said most members come to the gym to release

aggression or relieve stress PERIOD

Ryan Carli a personal trainer at the gym said members usually become addicted to the intense regimen of boxing kickboxing and MMA PERIOD

Very rarely do you see a person just

take it once and then quit Carli said PERIOD

Once theyve tried it theyre hooked on it PERIOD Its completely different than any other workout people have previously done. carli said a lot of women come into the gym and the demographic of LA Boxings clientele is between the ages of  and  PERIOD

One of the members Brooklyn Collins said she hated other workouts but then found LA Boxing to her liking PERIOD

The reason why I continue to come here is because I hate cardio Collins said PERIOD

Collins said she likes boxing because it feels better than kickboxing and MMA PERIOD She said she has been knocked down but it didnt stop her from working out PERIOD

Massi Negrillo a boxing trainer at the gym said he encourages every member to remain focused when boxing and use all of their muscles systematically PERIOD

Negrillo said he reminds them no one is perfect and mentioned the familiarity the gym has with its members is huge because no one feels left out PERIOD

Thats one of the coolest things about us youre not just a number here you do get to know people Sudor said PERIOD

The fun part for LA Boxing is when it will begin to reach out to communities to promote better fitness according to Sudor PERIOD

Sutor prefers to have a member come in who isnt physically fit or in the best shape because they are the easiest to work with PERIOD He said people who come in with the mentality they are worldclass athletes are the ones who dont last long PERIOD

Sutor doesnt believe LA Boxing has much competition in the city because there isnt another gym similar to this one PERIOD

He said its a better gym becuase it gives members an idea of what they want to do instead of walking around lifting weights running on a treadmill and then

going home PERIOD

With Chicago having a variety of gyms throughout the city Sutor feels LA Boxing targets the right people to make the gym standout from the rest PERIOD Currently there are four LA Boxing gyms in the

Chicagoland area PERIOD

There are some other martial arts gyms in Chicago that are amazing but they dont target what were after Sudor said PERIOD Were going after people who want to get into shape want to look and feel good but dont want to get on the treadmill. emodacurechroniclemail.com
