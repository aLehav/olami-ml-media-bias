James Dechant  Tuesday September  

If you can see Chuck Norris he can see you PERIOD If you cant see Chuck Norris you may be only seconds away from death PERIOD

Those my friends are words to live by PERIOD

These days Chuck Norris enjoys international fame and a welldeserved place among the pantheon of American heroes PERIOD He is a phenomenon that crosses all boundaries be they cultural political religious sexual racial or other PERIOD He is a man whose popularity far from declining with his age only waxes as he ripens into his upper 60s PERIOD Chuck Norris has roundhousekicked his way into our televisions our movies and our hearts PERIOD

Right now Chuck Norris is on my wall PERIOD Not literally  that wouldnt work  but in the form of a poster for a  action movie called Silent Rage. my roommate and I found this little gem at the University Park Mall and we could hardly contain our excitement PERIOD The large tagline near the top of the poster reads Science created him PERIOD Now Chuck Norris must destroy him. below that is more description  ah but how this poor language fails me Description does not accurately capture the poetry contained in these words PERIOD Hes an indestructible man fused with powers beyond comprehension PERIOD  An unstoppable terror who in one final showdown will push Chuck Norris to his limits PERIOD  And beyond. below the text and a picture of Chuck Norris sporting a sheriffs badge and ten gallon hat the title Silent Rage appears in bulky shadowed black letters PERIOD Next to this a smaller icon of Chuck Norris shirtless delivers a kick to the word Rage so that it begins to crumble and crack in half PERIOD This poster aptly showcases the selling power of Chuck Norris PERIOD In the movie he plays Texas sheriff Dan Stevens but you see no mention of that character on the poster PERIOD Instead the actors name appears multiple times like a brand product PERIOD The marketing geniuses at Columbia Pictures knew they were not going to sell this film on the basis of the plot alone PERIOD In case youre curious the story follows Chuck Norris as he battles a reanimated murderer he previously shot and killed but whom scientists brought back to life with rejuvenating powers. so they tried to sell the film based on Chuck Norris superstar charm his captivating charisma and his unassailable martial arts skills PERIOD

But what do you really know about Chuck Norris the man the myth the legend Less than you might suspect PERIOD For instance did you have any idea that Chuck Norris

Was born Carlos Ray Norris and did not get the nickname Chuck until he was serving with the American Air Force in South Korea PERIOD

Has a professional karate record of  with all five of his losses being avenged that is he later fought the victorious fighters and taught them the true meaning of pain PERIOD

Filled in for Sean Hannity on that hosts Fox News debate program on Jan PERIOD   PERIOD Look it up on YouTube you wont be disappointed. instructed Bob Barker in karate for years and appeared on The Price Is Right once for Barkers eightieth birthday PERIOD

As should be apparent Chuck Norris is a multifaceted multitalented humanitarian who eats criticism for breakfast PERIOD There is a reason that his name is a household synonym for sublime a reason Conan OBrien installed a Walker Lever on his desk to play random clips from Walker Texas Ranger a reason that Chuck Norris Facts are the biggest Internet craze ever a reason we cant get enough of him PERIOD

Most of us fail to realize what exactly drives the Chuck Norris mystique PERIOD I once realized it but then Chuck Norris became aware of this fact and roundhouse kicked it out of my mind PERIOD I can only offer the fragments of my hypothesis PERIOD

I posit that Chuck Norris career path was no mistake PERIOD I believe this as firmly as Chuck Norris believes evolution does not exist as he stated in an online column for WorldNetDaily PERIOD Yes you may look at his life and figure he is your average American soldier turned hardworking superstar karate fighter turned incredibly stiff movie actor showcasing formulaic and repetitive fight scenes turned television star responsible for reviving morally unsophisticated Westerns turned Total Gym infomercial salesman turned evangelical Christian author turned Internet fad and conservative spokesman PERIOD You may see him that way but it would be the last mistake you would ever make PERIOD

Chuck Norris who is omniscient knew scripts for movies like The Delta Force and The Octagon hardly merited the paper they were written on but he accepted those projects anyway PERIOD Just as some theologians argue that our tarnishing universal sin only further glorifies Christs redemptive work for humanity I argue that Chuck Norris early Hollywood mishaps only further elevate and exalt his many storied accomplishments today PERIOD He has karatechopped our expectations in half he has taken the glut of Chuck Norris humor in stride and he has never rested on his laurels PERIOD

Remember Chuck Norris does not sleep PERIOD He waits PERIOD

James Dechant is a senior English and Theology major who can be contacted at emailprotected PERIOD One time a man asked Chuck Norris if his real name was Charles. chuck Norris did not respond he simply stared at him until he exploded PERIOD

The views expressed in this column are those of the author and not necessarily those of The Observer PERIOD
