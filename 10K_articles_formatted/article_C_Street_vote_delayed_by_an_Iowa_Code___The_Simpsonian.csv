The Indianola City Council has postponed the vote on Simpsons C Street proposal due to a last minute mention of an Iowa Code PERIOD

The Indianola City Council met for a study session on Monday March  where it planned to discuss Simpson Colleges proposal to close C Street PERIOD

What they do in study session is just a conversation between all of them where they talk about things and no action can be taken no votes be made no motions can made its just more of a discussion said Jill Johnson executive director of marketing and public relations PERIOD

Due to the unexpected mentioning of the Iowa Code at the study session a new issue needs to be addressed before the potential closing of C Street can occur PERIOD

Unfortunately they never got very far because someone brought up that there is some section of Iowa Code that may prevent a city from closing a street Johnson said PERIOD It was sort of an obscure reference that came up sort of at the last minute. johnson said only two of the council members had access to the code and none of the others members had heard of it before so the council needed outside interpretation PERIOD

I think the next step is that they are going to ask their attorneys and probably Simpson will ask their attorneys to interpret what that code means Johnson said PERIOD And if it truly does mean that there is some obstacle that would prevent a city council from taking an action to close the street. the city council will now have some time to discuss the code due to the canceling of the March  meeting because Indianola schools are on spring break PERIOD The next meeting will not be held until March  PERIOD

Johnson said she doesnt think the proposal is a dead issue but isnt sure where it will go from here PERIOD

I really dont know what will happen but I know there is one thing that both sides can agree on is that it is a terrible street Johnson said PERIOD The street is in terrible condition and it needs to be fixed. indianolas one way streets also affect the problems Simpson faces with C Street and the city councils decision PERIOD

Years and years ago probably in the 70s Highway  was widened to four lanes and while they were doing that they had to reroute traffic through town Johnson said PERIOD So they rerouted the traffic that was coming down Highway  on Buxton and Howard PERIOD And thats why they changed them to one ways so the traffic flow would be easier PERIOD When the road was completed they just never switched them back. research has shown that the one way streets in town could be changed back to two way streets PERIOD

The citys engineers have said that a city Indianolas size does not necessarily support one way streets Johnson said PERIOD I mean if you think about rerouted  you can see that thats a lot of traffic and it made sense but just an everyday traffic patterns theyve said that theres really no reason that they have to be one ways. regardless of whether or not the proposal goes through the potential closing of C Street will be a lengthy process Johnson said PERIOD

To get passed it has to go through three public hearings so three sessions of council where they can vote Johnson said PERIOD So there is a six week time frame in there from whenever they make the motion to close it and they have to keep voting on it three times to make sure that its passed. johnson said she is upset with the lack of progress the proposal has made PERIOD

I think thats one thing that everyone agrees on and its a little frustrating to not be able to at least be making some steps toward what could be improvement for everybody at this point Johnson said PERIOD

Joe Sorenson senior and student body president said he has attended a lot of the city council meetings and thinks that something needs to be done with C Street PERIOD

I definitely see C Street as kind of an eyesore on campus so anything we can do to develop it or bring the East side and West side of campus together again Sorenson said PERIOD

Johnson has experienced the poor conditions of C Street first hand PERIOD

I personally would love to see the street close but more importantly I would love to see the street improved somehow because its just terrible to drive on Johnson said PERIOD I drive on it every day and I know how terrible it is. nicolle Whalen assistant professor of sport sciences and resident of Indianola also believes C Street should be closed PERIOD

I think it would look pretty Whalen said PERIOD I think it would look more cohesive PERIOD And we would have a better campus environment PERIOD It really would help unify everything and would really just have a good central spot to campus. multimedia Journalism Professor Lisa Carponelli is adding a new job to her weekly todo list the Saturday evening anchor at WHO  PERIOD This marks..
