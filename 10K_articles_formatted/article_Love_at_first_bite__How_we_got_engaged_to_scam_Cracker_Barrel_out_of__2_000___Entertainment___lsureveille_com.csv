For clarity J indicates thatJaydenis speaking and W indicates that Will is speaking PERIOD

The best things in life are free  love biscuits etc PERIOD The secondbest things in life are acquired through mischievous means  love biscuits etc PERIOD

In honor of Valentines Day Cracker Barrel created a contest to give away a free years worth of meals in the form of  in gift cards PERIOD

You just had to do one thing to enter Get engaged PERIOD At a Cracker Barrel PERIOD And record it PERIOD And post it on Instagram PERIOD And have your mom freak out this part isnt required for the contest but its likely to happen PERIOD

So we did what any two sane people would do got engaged PERIOD At a Cracker Barrelyou know the rest PERIOD

A post shared by Will Nickel wilnickel

J For the record this was all Wills idea PERIOD

W For the record this was all my idea PERIOD

Before we get too far into the story we should clarify we are not really engaged PERIOD Sorry Cracker Barrel W and also my friends from high school who sincerely congratulated us you have been fooled PERIOD

Our initial plan was to get a group of our friends to also do fake engagements PERIOD The contest could have up to five winners and the more entries we had the more likely we were to win PERIOD How many people would actually get engaged at a Cracker Barrel We figured we wouldnt have much real competition and having multiple entries would guarantee a win PERIOD

We got plenty of people to say they liked the idea but we didnt get any people to say they wanted to do it PERIOD Apparently proposing at a Cracker Barrel and posting it publicly to Instagram is really embarrassing and weird. in the end we had to settle on just one fake proposal and bank on that being enough to win the contest PERIOD We just had to make sure the proposal was good enough to convince the Cracker Barrel judges panel PERIOD

Govt Taco is a cute trendy taco restaurant in Baton Rouge PERIOD It is located at  Government Street PERIOD It has a happy hour every day from  p.m

We went to the only Cracker Barrel in town a few days after Valentines Day to avoid the real couples celebrating their love and as many people as possible PERIOD The goal was to make the proposal as cute as possible without getting a single person to notice us PERIOD

J I supplied the ring and the ring box  a Christmas gift Id gotten from my parents PERIOD

W I supplied the cuteness  an important part of a cute proposal PERIOD

We filmed ourselves walking into the store and messing around in the worldrenowned Cracker Barrel gift shop to make it more believable PERIOD We also sat down and enjoyed a meal to make it more believable PERIOD We also asked for more biscuits three times to make it more believable PERIOD

Students couldnt bottle up how excited they were to return from winter break with their newpastelcolored Stanley brand water bottles PERIOD

After eating we went outside and set up our camera on a barrel presumably full of crackers that was in front of part of the restaurant where no customers were sitting PERIOD We decided this would be the ideal place to propose so no one would see it but you could tell it was at a Cracker Barrel PERIOD

As we were preparing to film a bus full of families pulled into the Cracker Barrel parking lot and we began to panic PERIOD

J Will got down on one knee as fast as possible PERIOD I probably shouldve tried to fake cry but I didnt want to draw more attention to this already stupid idea  unlike Will who picked me up and spun me around PERIOD

W I like to spin PERIOD You should see me in our office chairs PERIOD

After editing together the video and coming up with a cute little caption we uploaded it to Instagram and waited PERIOD We patiently stalked the contest hashtag to see other posts and if we had any competition PERIOD

J Will did not patiently stalk. he looked at that hashtag every day PERIOD He would count how many posts there were PERIOD He would show them to me and be like theres just no shot that they can beat us. w I am a competitive person PERIOD I like to engage in a little trash talk and I like to win PERIOD

Then six days after we posted the video we received the notification we had been dreaming of Cracker Barrel has DMed you PERIOD

A DM from the official Cracker Barrel Instagram

We won the contest PERIOD

After giving Mr PERIOD Barrel our emails and signing some documents our free years supply of Cracker Barrel in the form of four  gift cards arrived along with a handwritten note congratulating us on our engagement PERIOD

A handwritten note and four  gift cards to Cracker Barrel

You may be asking yourself Is it ok to lie

To that we would say we didnt lie PERIOD There is no legal definition of an engagement and there was never a stipulation that we had to actually get married PERIOD I did propose which was the only real requirement PERIOD

Did we mislead Yes PERIOD Did we lie No PERIOD

You may then ask Well even if you didnt lie isnt it unethical to mislead someone like this

Unfortunately you cant hear our response because our mouths are too full of biscuits PERIOD
