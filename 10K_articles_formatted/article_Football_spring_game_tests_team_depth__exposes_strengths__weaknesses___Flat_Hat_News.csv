8464,2023-11-05,"head coach Jimmye Laycock  and William and Mary came into this offseason looking for answers PERIOD Last years winless conference slate Laycocks first in his  years at the helm of the Tribe certainly raised a few questions PERIOD

Saturdays Green and Gold Spring game the culmination of the football programs offseason practices offered few of the answers the College was looking for PERIOD Instead of sorting out the battle for the quarterback position it may have muddled it further and instead of revealing goto playmakers on the offensive side no clear stars emerged PERIOD

However the team clearly showed what its identity will be this season  the type of oldschool smashmouth football Laycocks teams have been known for when they are at their best PERIOD Running the ball and stopping the run will be key to the Tribes success PERIOD

Even for a running team though everything starts and ends with the quarterback position PERIOD Laycock felt that while each player showed their strengths and weaknesses none stood out more than the others PERIOD

They all showed good things and they all showed things they need to work on Laycock said PERIOD Its good for them to all play in a semigametype environment. sophomore Shon Mitchell started at quarterback for the firststringers but went threeandout on both of his first two possessions PERIOD Then on his first possession back in the game in the second half he misfired on a deep pass leading to an interception by redshirt freshman safety Gage Herdman PERIOD

I have to be disciplined Mitchell said PERIOD Just a simple mental mistake PERIOD I just have to be stronger and more disciplined than that. i have to be disciplined Mitchell said PERIOD Just a simple mental mistake PERIOD I just have to be stronger and more disciplined than that. junior quarterback Brandon Battle in his first possession behind center with the second team was picked off by redshirt freshman cornerback Jaden Barnes who returned it for a touchdown PERIOD In his second however Battle bounced back connecting on a couple throws before the Tribe offenses drive stalled out PERIOD

Sophomore Dean Rotger took over at quarterback in the second quarter and after throwing his first pass away quickly completed two passes to move the offense down the field PERIOD Redshirt freshman running back Owen Wright converted a fourthandone to help the cause PERIOD An illadvised lob down the sideline almost turned into a pick but the Tribe offense converted on its good field position as redshirt freshman kicker Jake Johnston knocked his kick through the uprights from  yards out PERIOD In the second half Rotger completed the Tribes longest pass of the day to redshirt freshman receiver Amonyae Watson for just over  yards PERIOD

Sophomore quarterback Ted Hefter entered for the last possession of the half running the twominute offense with confidence PERIOD He completed five of six passes all to tight ends and running backs PERIOD Hefter even got in front of sophomore running back Nate Evans to block on a firstdown run PERIOD Junior kicker Kris Hooper hit his 32yard field goal PERIOD Hefter came back out to start the second half and led a solid drive but it stalled at about the defenses 15yard line PERIOD

Brandon he conducted some drives and put some drives together that was good offensive coordinator DJ Mangas  said PERIOD He made some throws PERIOD All of them looked like they were fairly decisive for the most part PERIOD Looking at Ted you know you could say the same thing for all of them PERIOD They made some throws  they did some good things but each and every one of them made some mistakes as well. even with the inconsistency at the quarterback position the running game showed its strength PERIOD Junior running backs Albert Funderburke Jr PERIOD and Brehon Britt along with sophomores Noah Giles Jaret Anderson and Evans all got meaningful touches PERIOD

Funderburke who saw a reduced role last season as he was returning from a serious knee injury showed flashes of his freshman year self when he was a tough player to bring down PERIOD Anderson and Evans both were good options as receivers out of the backfield an important position for a team who is losing safety blanket Andrew Caskin who is graduating this year from the tight end spot PERIOD Britt showed off his speed busting through the defense on a run that was called back on a holding penalty PERIOD And Giles who had the most carries last season for the Tribe converted on a few shortyardage situations PERIOD

I thought the running backs had a really good spring Laycock said PERIOD

I thought the running backs had a really good spring Laycock said PERIOD Its so good to see Albert Funderburke back in there  Thinking about the identity on offense today we threw the ball a lot more than we ran the ball PERIOD Now whether thats going to be us or not I dont know. come summer the five of them will be battling for the role of primary ballcarrier PERIOD However chances are that the Tribe will roll with a rotation of backs PERIOD

On the defensive side of things the Tribe looks just as strong as it was last season PERIOD The defensive line led by juniors Gavin Johnson and Joe Suarez got consistent pressure on the quarterback PERIOD

At the same time the secondary looks primed to make big plays this fall PERIOD Alongside the two interceptions the cornerbacks and safeties broke up a number of passes PERIOD

Defensively I think were probably about where we should be Laycock said PERIOD Offensively weve got to pick it up a little more. its never a good sign for your offense when the defense wins a scrimmage in which the only way it can score is a defensive touchdown PERIOD But its important to note that in the offseason a football teams defense is often furthest ahead in its development PERIOD This isnt a good look for the Tribe offense but well have to wait for the fall to see whether the sputtering offense is a sign of greater issues or just a bump in the road PERIOD

One thing is clear if the Tribe is going to win football games this season its going to have to run the ball PERIOD
