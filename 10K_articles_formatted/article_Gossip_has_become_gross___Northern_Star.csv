Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  NYSSA BULKESNovember  

Gossip rags are officially trying to gross us out PERIOD

Rather than wow readers with juicy tidbits on how their favorite stars are more unusual and unique than fans originally knew the trend is to tell us how gross and oddballish celebrities truly are PERIOD

Its like a reallife biology experiment PERIOD Kind of like dissecting the frog except the cute dead specimen lying on your lab table is now Ashley Olsen PERIOD

Yep its the latest news PERIOD Ashley Olsen was seen canoodling with Lance Armstrong PERIOD Normally such news wouldnt really stray far from normal celebrity romances PERIOD This one however is laden with a nice big age gap of  years PERIOD

Thats like  as old as you PERIOD Ha

But thats not even the best part PERIOD In a Nov PERIOD  article on radar.com a site that prides itself for bringing readers the best of pop culture scandal style and politics the writer refers to Armstrong as parteunuch and Olsen as slightly less boobtastic than Barbie PERIOD

Wow PERIOD That radar is a bit too highly honed even for my scathing tastes PERIOD

Not only have we compared the seventime Tour de France winner and cancer survivor to a sexless creature but weve painted the story of a pair that gives the creepy tabloid BatBoy a run for his money PERIOD

So  when were we going to start talking about their career accomplishments

Gossip already annoys me PERIOD Its like admitting your life isnt exciting enough and being up to date on everyone elses business makes your existence that much more worthwhile PERIOD Its official Gossip has by dictionary definition become disgusting PERIOD Not just from a human standpoint of whats decent and whats not but whats just gross PERIOD

For example instead of doing my environmental report on presentday Germany I could go and vote on which Lindsay Lohan jail mugshot I like best Golly how ever shall I choose The one where her face is as pale as my legs or the one that looks like she just finished doing a line

Or how about the rags that compile photos of bikiniclad famous folk and compare cellulite

Im so glad bikini season is over PERIOD Not just because I dont have to get cancerred sunburns but because my eyes can heal PERIOD

Seriously I dont want to see that If theyre trying to channel the fatlady greeting cards found at Gadzooks they havent quite succeeded PERIOD The effort however has nailed the nasty sick foulness factor on the head PERIOD

Oh you feel the need to buy one Stop Its like the equivalent to saying watching E News is an acceptable replacement for watching CNN PERIOD Just take that . out of your wallet and promptly put it into the garbage outside Wallys Market if you really want to waste it PERIOD

At least that would stop the tabloid crap lining the checkout lanes from destroying my corneas PERIOD
