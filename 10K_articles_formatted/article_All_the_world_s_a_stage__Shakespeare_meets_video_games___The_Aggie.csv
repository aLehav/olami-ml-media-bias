UC Davis faculty students create motioncapture game PERIOD

Friends Aggies Countrymen lend me your ears PERIOD For many the very thought of performing Shakespeare conjures up memories of stammering through a soliloquy in high school while a room of bored classmates look on PERIOD But the UC Davis Modlab an experimental laboratory for media research and digital humanities has developed a video game designed to take the fear out of performing Shakespeare PERIOD

In the game titled Play the Knave players pick a scene to perform choose from a variety of stage and actor avatars and act out scenes while a Kinect motion sensor camera picks up their movements and mirrors it on screen PERIOD The result is Shakespeare karaoke which allows players to engage with the plays of Shakespeare in an accessible way PERIOD

The idea of using performance to teach Shakespeare is an old idea said Gina Bloom a UC Davis English professor and the video game project director PERIOD A lot of teachers will assign their students a scene out of a play and the idea is that by speaking the lines and thinking about how to position your body you demonstrate an understanding of the play PERIOD So this game is just using the affordances of digital technology to make that assignment easier. sawyer Kemp a fifthyear graduate student in English and the installation coordinator of the project has travelled with the game to various Shakespeare festivals and witnessed firsthand the educational aspect of Play the Knave. for every time you ask someone to play five will say no but every time someone boots it up  people will come watch Kemp said PERIOD Its really validating to see these people who say theyre not an actor and they dont play video games to tell their friend Oh move your arm that way By watching other people do it they realize they actually do have some kind of knowledge PERIOD It shows that theyre engaging and understanding the performance. alison Tam a thirdyear English major who interned on the project was present at the games installation at the local Davis Arts Center located on  F street over the summer and enjoyed watching how the game engages people of all ages PERIOD

It was cool seeing how kids react to Shakespeare Tam said PERIOD You usually think of Shakespeare as something elevated and academic PERIOD With a game its so democratized that anyone can read or play it so it gives people a greater sense of ownership over Shakespeare. for Nick Toothman one of the lead programmers of the game and a sixthyear graduate student in computer science the most rewarding part of the project was at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival when he saw the public have fun with something he helped create PERIOD

It sunk in that Ive done something that people can have fun with Toothman said PERIOD Thats the most amazing feeling. however the course of videogame production never did run completely smooth PERIOD The team has encountered some growing pains during the games development mostly due to a gap between what they would like to add to the game and what is realistically achievable PERIOD

A lot of the challenges were figuring out what we could offer people in the experience and what we would love to offer Toothman said PERIOD We would love to give facial or detailed hand animation a try but the technology is just not accessible right now. bloom said that she sees the game growing in three directions continuing with the shortterm installations that have been set up at various universities and festivals bringing the game to teachers and then eventually releasing an athome version PERIOD

Theres some tension between what our budget is and what we would like Kemp said PERIOD Eventually we want there to be more customization like allowing people to change out the costumes or sets. but despite the restraints the team has found that glitches can often be incorporated in performances and utilized to an actors benefit PERIOD When asked what their favorite scene to perform was Bloom Kemp and Toothman all had the same answer the ghost scene from Hamlet because of funny glitches that allow players to exercise their creativity PERIOD

At the Utah Shakespeare Festival these two kids were playing the scene and realized that when you cross the avatars one of them will disappear Kemp said PERIOD One kid took advantage of the glitch and hed creep around and pop up randomly PERIOD When you watch the video playback it would look like the ghost was disappearing and reappearing PERIOD I thought it was genius that he was using the system to make the game even better. and so all the world really does become a stage as Play the Knave allows people who do not consider themselves performers a chance to indulge their inner actor and to engage with Shakespeares plays in an innovative and interactive way PERIOD
