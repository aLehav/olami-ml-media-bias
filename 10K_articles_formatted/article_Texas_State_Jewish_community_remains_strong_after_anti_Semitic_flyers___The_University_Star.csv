8550,2023-11-04,"antiSemitic flyers were found on campus at Alkek Library on March   PERIOD Star File Photo

In March  Texas States Jewish community woke up to white supremacist and antiSemitic propaganda plastered on campus PERIOD In the aftermath of the flyers rally against the community they face isolation and negligence PERIOD
The Swastikaladen flyers taped to the columns outside of the Alkek Library stated White man are you sick and tired of the Jews destroying your country through mass immigration and degeneracy Join us in the struggle for global white supremacy 
It wasnt the first white supremacist messaging found on campus as Patriot Front and other white supremacist organizations have circulated antiMuslim antiblack antiimmigration and antiliberal agenda flyers since the November  election of President Donald Trump PERIOD As recently as October  white supremacist propaganda has been found on campus PERIOD
The March  incident however marked the first affront to the Jewish community at Texas State PERIOD Katie Cohn consumer affairs senior said although she knew antiSemitism existed it was shocking to face it on campus PERIOD
It doesnt necessarily surprise me that thats an attitude that people have Cohn said PERIOD The posters were surprising because that was a very big expression written on paper in black and white. university President Denise Trauth did not immediately publicly respond to the March incident but did meet with Keely Freund political science junior and other members from Jewish Bobcats an oncampus organization for Jewish students after white supremacists posted a white nationalist banner over Alkek Library stating America is a white nation. we did talk to Trauth after the big banner incident on Alkek and it was kind of disappointing because her response was like These are people probably not at school PERIOD They came here PERIOD Theres not much we can do about it Freund said PERIOD
Trauths lack of action mirrors a larger history of silence by the Texas State community including oncampus student organizations PERIOD Talya Morris political science senior said though she feels like most Jewish students identify as politically leftleaning there isnt much support from political peers leaving the group in a state of limbo PERIOD
What are people doing Nothing Morris said PERIOD You dont feel like anyone has your side PERIOD The flyers were put up by the altright but you cant really turn to liberals PERIOD Who is really saying that antiSemitism is alive other than Jews
According to  Brandeis University data it is estimated there are  Jewish people in Travis and Hays county combined PERIOD Because of the small Jewish population in the area most Jewish students believe their demographic is more or less forgotten by their peers and community PERIOD
The number of times Ive had people say Wow Ive never met a Jewish person before and youd think theyd discovered a unicorn Morris said PERIOD The follow up is You dont look Jewish. i usually go off By Hitlers standards Eugenics What am I not meeting
Morris isnt alone in feeling ostracized PERIOD Cohn said students reaction to the antiSemitic fliers was perhaps unintentionally hurtful to those who were personally targeted PERIOD
I dont think the majority of people on this campus inherently agreed with those attitudes or antiSemitic opinions or beliefs but its kind of sad to see people walking by looking at it kind of as like a spectacle Cohn said PERIOD They didnt take it down and I dont know why that is. cohn said only Jewish students voice their concerns when antiSemitic incidents occur PERIOD She encourages other students to defend their Jewish peers as well PERIOD
Were always welcoming other people to step up and say something Cohn said PERIOD I think sometimes people are like Thats not my place. but more than likely were going to appreciate the effort. students interested in joining Jewish Bobcats can sign up for a community email through the website PERIOD
