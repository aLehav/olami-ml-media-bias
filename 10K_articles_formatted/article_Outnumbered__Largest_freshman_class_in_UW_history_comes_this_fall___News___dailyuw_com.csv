Students from the largest freshman class in UW history converge at Sylvan Grove PERIOD The UWs switch to the Coalition Application is one of the reasons for the increase in class size PERIOD

Freshman enrollment numbers at the UW have stayed constant over the past few years hovering at about  to  PERIOD However the incoming freshman class enrollment is currently projected at  PERIOD

The number of total freshmen enrolled wont be official until a few weeks into the  school year because the UW has to take into account summer melt which is when students who were accepted fail to enroll in fall quarter and more students being admitted from the waitlist PERIOD

There has been some concern over the ratio of instate students to outofstate students who are offered admission primarily due to  budget cuts PERIOD However instate residents have made up almost twothirds of the class consistently PERIOD For example the  freshman class was  percent instate students and the  freshman class was  percent instate PERIOD

The main reason for this difference is the amount of outofstate students attending the UW PERIOD More outofstate students than expected accepted their admission to the UW which created the increased amount of students PERIOD

However the increase in freshman enrollment is not expected to be a trend according to Paul Seegert UW director of admissions PERIOD

Due to the unexpected increase in the amount of freshmen attending the UW for the  school year Seegert said there will probably be fewer people admitted to the freshman class during the  school year to account for this years increase PERIOD But the university has not made enrollment goals for next year so the expected capacity for  is still to be determined PERIOD

Last year was also the first year the UW used the Coalition Application which is a national application used by many universities for its convenience PERIOD

We think being on a national application is good for all of our applicants Seegert said PERIOD That way when they are applying to the University of Washington it is easier for them to apply to other universities as well as the UW. before students officially attend their first class at the UW they are required to go through Advising  Orientation sessions PERIOD

Students are led by orientation leaders who help students adjust to the school year on campus and act as a resource for students throughout the school year PERIOD They meet other freshmen and learn more about what attracts students to attend the UW over other colleges firsthand PERIOD

Many students come to UW for the programs that we have that are rated very highly across the nation orientation leader Ambar Aleman wrote in an email PERIOD Many of our out of state students say they hear about UW through our programs and many others have had family members attend UW in the past and that is why they considered it a top choice PERIOD Other local students say it is the best choice for staying in state. another way the UW tries to help with the transition is through welcome events like Dawg Daze interim assistant director of First Year Programs Matt Skirven said PERIOD It will help them to get engaged with campus resources and experience what life on campus is like PERIOD The UW is a big place with a lot of activities and events going on throughout the school year so we want to give them a taste of that the first few days on campus. reach writer Monica Mursch at newdailyuw.com PERIOD Twitter MonicaMursch
