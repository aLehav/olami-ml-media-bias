Sometimes college is about the education you get PERIOD Sometimes its about the relationships you make along the way PERIOD

Take Sage Bannick a  UW drama graduate PERIOD His time at the University was spent much like any students except he chose USCs film school for graduate studies PERIOD

THE STORY

The story is a traditional detective story told in a nontraditional way PERIOD With much homage to classic detective stories the filmmakers grew up with the film adopts a style similar to that of the French New Wave films PERIOD

Johnny Mac is the detective going against his instincts to investigate a stalking case of a local waitress PERIOD Mac follows the stalker a skateboarding punk who leads him deeper into a web of deception .. PERIOD on a college campus PERIOD

As the detective turns down blind alleys and dead ends he discovers a plot to throw a football game masterminded by a local gambling ring PERIOD Its curtains for Mac and hes left holding the bag as the authorities close in PERIOD

The filmmakers realized that it would be far easier to follow a single character like a detective around given their budgetary constraints PERIOD Luckily they were able to use their different film stocks in a way that made sense to the story PERIOD

Much of the detectives investigation was in black and white while the digital camera the detective used picked up brilliant color PERIOD The storyline surrounding the detectives main love interest Naomi Rose Jumia Dowmit was filmed in a series of color shots that lost saturation as the story progressed PERIOD

THE SETUP

Bannicks partner in the production is Ari Bernstein PERIOD The two had the use of a diner as a command center in the heart of downtown Los Angeles and looked for suitable locations within walking distance PERIOD Each day they would scout those locations shooting with a special camera a small amount of the same film stock theyd be using for the actual movie PERIOD

 Bernstein said PERIOD We figured that if we could shoot just  minutes of usable footage each daywed have enough for a feature in just  days.Fuji was throwing away film and we rescued itIn fact with what I had saved in my fridge and that Fuji stock we shot on every type of filmstock that exists practically.What we did was similar to what Stone did with Natural Born KillersWe mixed not only the film stocks in a specific way but the conventions as well.We really couldnt afford to pay for gaffing and professional lightingWe were inspired by Terence Malicks film Badlands shot at sunset when the natural lighting is perfect.The act of filmmaking is an act of rebellionOnce you commit to that act you have to follow through PERIOD You really cant be rebellious only part of the time and conservative part of the time.Presto150 extras. bannick and Bernstein recognized this as they quickly had their film transferred to miniDV so they could edit at home PERIOD A windfall for the production included the discovery of jazz legend Chuck E PERIOD Weiss who agreed to let the team use four of his songs for the film PERIOD

Bannick who is from eastern Washington described over the phone an elaborate plan to market the film locally screening in places like Wenatchee Omak WSU and Central Washington University PERIOD

They have plans to show the film in late January to Seattle audiences as a fundraiser for marketing their film followed by screenings in a worldwide film festival circuit PERIOD Bannick described a theatrical release just for the west coast that would follow the festival tour PERIOD

They also intend to show the film for free on campus to students according to Bannick PERIOD
