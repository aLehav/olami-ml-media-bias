5367,2016-04-13,"mr PERIOD Knights supposed speech crime occurred during ASSU Senate debate of theResolution to Recognize and to Reaffirm the FightAgainst AntiSemitism PERIOD The proposed resolution recites a purported U.S PERIOD Department of State State Department definition of antiSemitism and State Department examples of such bigotry PERIOD The resolutions authors lifted this definition and these examples from a2010 Fact Sheet from the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat AntiSemitism PERIOD They also misrepresented the source of the definitionwhich was not the State Department but the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia PERIOD

The resolution recapitulated the special envoys assertion that allegations about  Jews controlling the media economy government or othersocietal institutions are contemporary examples of antiSemitism PERIOD Mr PERIOD Knight debated the appropriateness of including that assertionin the resolution PERIOD Questioning these potential power dynamics  is not antiSemitism he observed PERIOD I think its a very validdiscussion. many bigots harbor irrational beliefs about Jews as a group and among these for some bigots are fantastic suspicions concerningJewish political and economic power PERIOD Throughout history Jews have suffered horrendously from such bigotry and still suffer from it.The questioning that Mr PERIOD Knight endorsed is the antidote for this ignorance not an instance of it PERIOD

Yet Jews are not the only victims of bigotry and may themselves be bigots PERIOD Countless times I have witnessed Jews expressdisapprobation or even disgust for individual Arabs or Muslims not because of their individual actions or characters but solelybecause they are Arab or Muslim PERIOD Bigotry is wrong no matter its perpetrator or object a fact the resolution obscured PERIOD

The notion that only Jews may be victims of antiSemitism is itself bigotry PERIOD Arabicspeaking Muslims outnumber HebrewspeakingJews among the Semitic peoples PERIOD Arabs too may be victims of antiSemitism yet the resolution ignores them PERIOD

Since  only Jews have chaired the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System PERIOD Is this particular pattern in the leadershipof the worlds most powerful central bank an outcome of a worldwide Zionist conspiracy as some believe Does it stem from proJewish bias I seriously doubt it PERIOD To thebest of my knowledge informed by 25years on Wall Street meetings I have attended at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and multipleinteractions with Fed and Treasury officials the common Jewish heritage of Greenspan Bernanke and Yellen played no role in theirnominations PERIOD

But to Mr PERIOD Knights point if what I deem to be a coincidental inconsequential feature of centralbank control over the past three decades another deemed worthy ofinvestigation as possible evidence of favoritism or worse would I consider such inquiry to beipso factoproof of bigotry Of coursenot just as I would not assume that investigations of the phenomenon of white male domination of venture capital allocations areborne of bigotry PERIOD Bigotry and favoritism are real phenomena with real manifestations and as such investigating their effects islegitimate PERIOD Just because bigots may jump to conclusions and confuse effects with causes brings no discredit to nonbigots who seecurious patterns in data and choose to form and test hypotheses PERIOD

The resolution is repugnant for proposing the equivalent of reeducation camps for innocent student senators advancing a bigoteddefinition of antiSemitism focusing solely on bigotry suffered by Jews and for reciting examples of antiSemitism that are no suchthing PERIOD Mr PERIOD Knight was right to question the recital that troubled him PERIOD Shame should be felt only by the narrow minds that endorsed thisresolution and deliberately misrepresented his words PERIOD
