When I was little I climbed trees had tea parties scraped my knees and wore princess dresses PERIOD It wasnt until I was much older that I realized how open my childhood was PERIOD My parents encouraged me to explore my interests whether they were girly or not PERIOD I could be a girl with grubby fingernails from digging a hole in the backyard while pretending to be an archeologist with my twin brother PERIOD I could splash around in puddles and look for worms while wearing my Bella princess costume PERIOD I could define for myself what it means to be girly and Ive only just begun to realize what a profound influence that had on me PERIOD

While my parents didnt discuss gender roles with my brother and I they never pushed us to be more stereotypically masculine or feminine. i think that their relaxed attitude toward the topic allowed me to view my definition of girly as the norm PERIOD Discussing the topic would have made me more aware that there are definitions surrounding what it means to be masculine and feminine. although I was aware of those definitions from the media I never felt that they applied to me PERIOD

It wasnt until high school that I started to realize that many people both boys and girls are put in boxes PERIOD Girls are supposed to be breakable little porcelain dolls and boys are supposed to only be seen with their tough masculine masks on PERIOD The thing is most people dont fit into these molds PERIOD However society tells girls and boys to behave in certain ways and since parents were girls and boys once many pass on these messages to their children PERIOD Im not here to blame anyoneI think even those who uphold this system of orderly boxes are also victims of the system PERIOD No one wants to be stuffed inside a box that only part of them fits into PERIOD

I am a feminist because I hate boxes PERIOD It makes me sad when I see young women restraining their opinions because they dont want to seem bossy PERIOD I hate seeing young men scared of crying because they are afraid of seeming weak PERIOD For me being a feminist is about being an activist for gender equality not about hating a particular gender PERIOD Although the patriarchy does exist I also believe that our system of gender roles has hurt men as well PERIOD When I look at the most important men in my life my dad and my brother I see people who encourage me in everything I do PERIOD I see a father who wants his daughter to get a college degree and a job where she is the boss and brother who sees nothing wrong with intelligently bickering with his sister PERIOD I dont see people who represent the patriarchy but rather men who are just as uncomfortable with the idea of boxes as I am PERIOD Although I realize that many men are not as open as my dad and brother are it is still important to include men in the discussion PERIOD If not I am afraid that my childhood where I ran around in tea and dirt stained princess dresses will continue to be the exception PERIOD
