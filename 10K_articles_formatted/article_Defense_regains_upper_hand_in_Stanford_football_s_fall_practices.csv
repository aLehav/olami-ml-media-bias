5392,2014-08-15,"thursday marked the ninth day of Stanfords annual training camp and with camp coming to a close on August  head coach David Shaw has seen a recurring trend in this weeks training Stanfords defense has been dominant in its scrimmages with Stanfords firstteam offense PERIOD

At the end of last week the offense really was kind of handling the defense running the ball in offensedefense scrimmages Shaw said PERIOD And the last two practices the defense has really been dominant PERIOD It was good to see from a defense perspective PERIOD Good physical day today though. on Monday Coach Shaw was impressed with the play of defensive end Henry Anderson and defensive backs Dallas Lloyd and Ronnie Harris PERIOD During Thursdays practice a different set of defensive players caught coach Shaws attention PERIOD

Fifthyear senior David Parry was very good Shaw said PERIOD Fifthyear senior Henry Anderson again very good PERIOD Fifthyear senior A.J PERIOD Tarpley is capping off an outstanding camp making plays PERIOD I think junior Kodi Whitfield has had a couple good days back to back PERIOD Thats been good to see also. while these aforementioned players have all impressed Shaw the return of junior defensive lineman Aziz Shittu from injury and his play after his return has also encouraged Stanfords head coach PERIOD

Shittu was back live today full speed today which was good Shaw said PERIOD Just so quick and explosive PERIOD We need him we need him to play at a high level PERIOD He and fifthyear senior Blake Lueders are going to play a lot of football for us. shittu a junior from Atwater California is one of the most important pieces on Stanfords defense PERIOD Stanford has a ferocious pass rusher in Anderson a solid secondary led by Jordan Richards and Alex Carter and a strong inside linebacker in Tarpley PERIOD But if Stanford is going to replicate last years success against opponents running backs when the team was third in the country in opponents rushing yards per game Shittu has to be on the field and contributing valuable playing time potentially as Parrys backup at nose tackle PERIOD

According to Shaw it is Shittus versatility that makes him so valuable to this team an aspect that Shaw hopes can transform Shittu into a breakout player PERIOD

He can play anywhere close to the edge of the defensive line anywhere across the front he can play Shaw said PERIOD The biggest thing for me is he has learned it all he knows the different techniques involved he knows all the calls PERIOD How smart he is is as important as how quick he is so he can be that versatile guy that can be anywhere across the front PERIOD He could start one game at one position and midway through hes on another position PERIOD Thats great. if there has been one thing that has been talked about more than Stanfords defense it has been the status of senior wide receiver Ty Montgomery PERIOD Montgomery missed Stanfords spring practices because of a shoulder injury and his status for Stanfords opener against UCDavis is questionable PERIOD Although Shaw did not shed any light on Montgomerys status and whether he would be ready for the teams first game he did discuss Montgomerys work ethic over the summer and how much better he can be this season PERIOD

Right now its scary how much better he can be PERIOD I think hes put on eight to ten pounds hes faster and more explosive and just excited about getting the opportunity to play Shaw said PERIOD His energy is up he doesnt want to come out of practice he wants to get a rep hes pushing himself which I think is great PERIOD The skys the limit for him but as he and I talk I just tell him I just want you to be Ty PERIOD Dont worry about all the other stuff that can happen PERIOD All of the stuff people are going to be talking about for all of these other awards PERIOD Thats fine and good PERIOD Lets just focus on the football give your best. hes been doing that every day. it remains to be seen whether or not Montgomery will play in Stanfords opener PERIOD Shaw and the rest of the Stanford program are confident that once Montgomery comes back he can pick up right where he left off starring as Stanfords everydown deep threat PERIOD
