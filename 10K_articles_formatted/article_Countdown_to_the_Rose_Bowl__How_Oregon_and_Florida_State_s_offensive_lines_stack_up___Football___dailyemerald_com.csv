7662,2014-12-05,"in the days leading up to the  Rose Bowl the Emerald will take a unitbyunit look at Oregon and Florida State determining which team has the edge going into the showdown on Jan PERIOD 1in Pasadena PERIOD Today well look at each teams offensivelines with thoughts on Florida State from Perry Kostidikasof the Florida State View PERIOD

Oregon

The added allotment of time leading up to the Rose Bowl hasthe Oregon offensive linein a position that only compares to the first two weeks of the regular season PERIOD In other words the unit isalmost ashealthy as it was in September PERIOD With only center Hroniss Grasus status up in the air the Ducks offensive line mayhave every part it possessed as it entered its bout with Michigan St PERIOD on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Grasu has missed the lastthree games after injuring his leg at Utah on Nov PERIOD 8but his absence did not translate into a drop in production PERIOD While the injuries to tackles Tyler Johnstone Andre Yruretagoyena and Jake Fisher stirred a disheveled mess in the early part of the season Oregons offensive line has revamped into a formidable unit that has keyed its eightgame winning streak PERIOD

After its lone loss of the season to Arizona on Oct PERIOD   a game in which Marcus Mariota was droppedfive times  Oregons rushing attack has averaged  yards per game and the line has surrendered just  sacks PERIOD

Anchoring all of this success has been a line that has rebounded and retooled after each injuryits endured PERIOD In all the unit has assembled eight different starting combinations and at certain points relied on a true freshman and walkon PERIOD Fishers presence may be the most impactful as his return to the lineup initially sparked the pace Oregons been running at ever since PERIOD

Florida State

For Florida State the situation at the offensive line has beensomewhat similar to the Ducks PERIOD After starting center Austin Barron broke his arm head coach Jimbo Fisher eventually moved original left tackle Cam Erving to shore up the struggles the middle of the line faced PERIOD True freshman Roderick Johnson then assumed Barrons original position before the Seminoles matchup with Miami on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

The alterationpaid dividends PERIOD Since then the unithas given up just two sacks and Florida State ballcarriersareaveraging over six yards per carry PERIOD

The upgrades have definitely helped both the pass and run game Kostidakis said PERIOD Especially in terms of Dalvin Cook because once he finds a hole hes liable to be a threat. cooks become a byproduct of the switch and a firm example came in the teams last contest PERIOD In the Seminoles  win over Georgia Tech in the ACC Championship Cook rushed for a seasonhigh  yards and a touchdown PERIOD

Aside from Johnson the group is full of seniors thatare experienced and proven PERIOD Erving has won consecutive ACC Jacobs Blocking Trophyshonor given to best linemen in the ACCwhile left guard Josue Matias and right guard Tre Jackson are projected to go as high as the second round in the  NFL Draft PERIOD

Advantage Oregon.Sure Florida State has the NFL type models at the position however its averages on offenselook pedestrian to the pace Oregons moved at PERIOD Florida State is currently averaging just .8rushing yards per game  over  yards less than Oregons average.Although theirs a dramatic difference in the Seminoles play following the movementon the line the Ducks consistency trumps that of their opponents PERIOD
