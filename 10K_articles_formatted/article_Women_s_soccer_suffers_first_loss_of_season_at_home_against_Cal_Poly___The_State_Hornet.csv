State Hornet StaffAugust  

Sacramento State womens soccer hosted Cal Poly today in its breast cancer awareness game where the undefeated Mustangs won  which gave the Hornets their first loss of the season PERIOD

Both teams had  shots at goal throughout the game and played the starting goalies the entire  minutes PERIOD Sac State sophomore goalie Kimberly Mata had four saves compared to Cal Poly freshman goalkeeper Alyssa Giannettis seven PERIOD

Both teams played the whole field the first  minutes of the game with the Hornets deep in Mustang territory but Cal Poly turned it around and pressured Sac State offensively to move the game over to the Hornets side PERIOD

In the beginning of the game we dominated them but then they were in our territory after that said Sac State womens soccer head coach Randy Dedini PERIOD I think we were just too reactionary PERIOD We werent anticipating and we reacted to whatever they did. less than  minutes in to the game midfielder Cristina Farrington of the Mustangs used a header for a shot at goal but the ball went just left of the net as the score remained  PERIOD Farrington did not stop there as the junior scored two of the Mustangs four goals by the end of the game PERIOD

We just really need to work on getting our marks and following them said Sac State veteran defender Gabriela Trenton PERIOD After the ball was playing we were reacting instead of knowing where to be at the right time. a yellow card was called on Sac State midfielder Megan Burg midway through the first half which is when Sac State began making substitutions PERIOD

The Hornets utilized  of their 30player roster on the field at some point during todays game all of which got over  minutes of playing time PERIOD

Its still early in our season so were still looking at players to see who can step up and do things Dedini said PERIOD Weve got a lot of good players. sac State had control with less than three minutes left in half but Cal Poly hustled back for a goal from the top left corner of the box by substituted forward Sara Epps PERIOD

The Mustangs led  at halftime but the Hornets came back strong to score less than seven minutes in to the second half tying the score  PERIOD

Offensively I thought we did some good things occasionally but we were just too reactionary and too loose in the back defensively Dedini said PERIOD

Sac States only goal was made by the junior transfer out of Nevada Raylene Larot with the assist from forward Jordan Carlberg PERIOD This marks Larots first goal of the season and as a Hornet PERIOD

We came out strong and I think once we got scored on we just kind of put our heads down Larot said PERIOD We should have been more positive. the Mustangs did not let the tie last long as they widened the lead scoring three goals in a row in only seven minutes to put them at the final score of  PERIOD Farrington made the second and fourth goals and the third goal came from centerback Braelyn Fetsch PERIOD

The goals were really fast on top of each other Trenton said PERIOD This is our wake up call PERIOD We can look at the film and now work on these things and get better from it. sac State now has one loss on the board  and will head in to its fourth game of the season playing for a win against the University of San Francisco Friday at  p.m PERIOD in at Negoesco Stadium PERIOD
