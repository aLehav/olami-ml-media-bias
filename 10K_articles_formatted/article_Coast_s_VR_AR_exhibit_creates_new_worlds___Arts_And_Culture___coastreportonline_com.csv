The exhibit Immersion Visions of the Singularity through VRAR will transport viewers to another dimension  one where technology and humans come together PERIOD

Cocurated by Matthew Newman and Scott Broberg the exhibit is composed by students from Orange Coast Colleges new immersive media program PERIOD In it you will find different sections and 3D prints taken from sculptures and created entirely in virtual reality PERIOD

When using a virtual reality VR headset you are taken to a different realm and travel to a futuristic world PERIOD The augmented reality AR experience is viewed through interactive tablets that have been mapped to the floor plan PERIOD

Matthew Newman an instructor in the FilmVideo department has worked in VR for six years and has been teaching at OCC for two semesters PERIOD He previously worked as an art director at a gallery in Newport Beach and has his own video studio PERIOD

It the gallery did not necessarily mean to present AR as an art medium but rather to present the possibilities of AR Newman said PERIOD

More specifically the presentation of AR is an extension of the art experience creating an interactive gallery PERIOD Instead of just looking at a painting you can interact with the art PERIOD

Its an evolution of an art gallery Newman said PERIOD

As part of the exhibit Anthony Cruz an immersive media major presented a piece on life and death. his exhibit explores the everpopular trope of attempting to use VR to survive death PERIOD

Throughout life we gather experiences and information PERIOD Now artists can recreate interactive stimulations. instead of visiting graveyards we can bring them back in virtual reality Cruz said

VR carries with its connotations of implausible scifi novels taking place in far away worlds but in actuality VR is becoming more and more accessible on Earth PERIOD

OCC became one of the first community colleges in the nation to offer a VRAR certificate program when it began last semester as part of the FilmVideo department PERIOD

It is a twoyear certificate but with enough engagement and enrollment from students the department is hoping to make it a major PERIOD

Newman said the future of the technology is endless adding that augmented reality is used by surgeons and astronauts along with the Army which is using headsets on a transparent display like a video game PERIOD

Newman said that he was excited for the limitless possibilities of VR PERIOD This gives students the opportunity to build narrative experiences and to build virtual sets PERIOD

For the consumer VR is finally at that point where they can afford it and buy it which is great for the industry PERIOD We have a lot of students designers and developers using this technology Newman said PERIOD

Immersion VRAR Visions of the Singularity will remain open until April  in the Frank M PERIOD Doyle Arts Pavilion which is open Monday through Thursday from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD Admission is free PERIOD
