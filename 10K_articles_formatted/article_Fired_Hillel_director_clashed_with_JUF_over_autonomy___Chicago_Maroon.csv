2191,2022-03-16,"details emerged last night about the deteriorating relationship between the Newberger Hillels recently fired executive director Dan Libenson and the organization that terminated him the Jewish United Fund of Chicago JUF at an open discussion with two of the higherups involved PERIOD

In the second open meeting this week over the hotly debated firing Libensons successor Interim Director Paul Saiger A.B PERIOD  and John Lowenstein the JUF official overseeing all Illinois Hillels fielded pointed questions from Jewish students about why Libensons pink slip was necessary PERIOD

What weve learned from the student group here is you guys want complete transparency and were going to give you that to the best of our ability Lowenstein said PERIOD

Tensions have long been known to exist between the JUF and Libenson whose organizational philosophy stressed greater freedom from the JUF the owner of the Hillel building endowment and name PERIOD

However Lowenstein explained corporate autonomy for the Hillel was never a viable option due to resistance from donors who gave money on the condition of JUF oversight PERIOD

Whats more according to Saigers account corporate independence would also have run against an agreement dating back more than  years between the Hillel the JUF and Newberger family PERIOD

In the early 1990s the Newberger family funded a chapel inside the Hillel on campus Saiger said after the meeting PERIOD

By  the building had fallen into disrepair and the Newbergers donated an additional  for repairs PERIOD Their only condition was that the building would become JUF property the executive board promptly transferred ownership PERIOD

In  beset with financial problems the Hillel signed the rest of its assetsincluding its endowment and nameover to the JUF PERIOD However Saiger said the assets were to remain for the eternal use of U of C students PERIOD

The relationship with the JUF would grow to be a source of dismay until in a March  letter to JUF President Steven Nasatir and Chair Skip Schrayer Hillel board member Ruth OBrien decried the Hillels lack of corporate independence PERIOD

The letter concluded with Libensons and the boards plans to resign and form a separate Jewish organization elsewhere under a different name PERIOD

Harvey Barnett an attorney representing Schrayer and Nasatir shot back two days later

Your utter refusal to engage in any constructive discussion of fiscal responsibility coupled with Dan Libensons totally inappropriate actions as an employee leave us no choice Barnett wrote PERIOD We are compelled to accept the resignation of all the members of the advisory committee effective immediately and in the absence of such resignations to terminate forthwith any further service on your part. libensons firing and the dismissal of his board became inevitable once their intentions to form a separate organization became apparent Lowenstein said after the meeting PERIOD

With Hillel and JUF still joined at the hip Libenson is continuing his plans PERIOD In a conversation last night he said he will run his new organization JUChicago just as he led Hillel for the past six years hoping to serve Jewish undergraduates and graduate students on campus PERIOD

At this point Im just focused on the future and carrying on the great work Hillel has done in the past six years serving the community he said PERIOD Although the organization hasnt secured a space Libenson hopes to have done so by this fall PERIOD

Saiger has worked within the national Hillel organization since  PERIOD He will continue in his position stabilizing the Hillels finances and putting together a new executive board until next summer at the latest he said PERIOD He will also lead the search for a new director PERIOD

Since the town hall meeting on Monday students have formed the Jewish Student Working Group and are planning to form a student board that will liaise between Hillel and JUF employees and the rest of the student body PERIOD

Dan was the driving force behind this program and I have a great amount of respect for his work Saiger said PERIOD The real tragedy of this situation is that students have been impacted in a painful way. your donation will support the student journalists of University of Chicago PERIOD Your contributions go towards our annual website hosting costs and equipment costs PERIOD
