365,2016-06-08,"news broke this week via Shirley Young of the Boston Globe that the MBTA will soon service latenight weekend travelers around the city PERIOD Starting as early as this coming spring all T subways and the  most popular bus routes will run until  a.m PERIOD on Saturday and Sunday mornings according to Young PERIOD

Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick was quoted in the Globe article about the expanded hours saying Is this cool or what after finding  million as well as corporate partners to help with the MBTAs latest project PERIOD

While this move by the T will surely benefit the Boston nightlife one should not expect a Green Line trip to Harvard Avenue at  a.m PERIOD to be any better than it is now at midnight PERIOD Expanded hours are necessary for the city to truly take advantage of the fact that most of its younger crowd wants to stay out past midnight PERIOD

Bars clubs and music venues like the House of Blues will now be able to extend their hours knowing their customers relying on public transit will be able to stay a few hours longer PERIOD

The fairly obvious issue here is that the T is not magically going to become any more tolerable at  a.m PERIOD than it is anytime after midnight nowadays PERIOD If you are heading anywhere near Allston during those hours the T is bound to be full of drunken andor obnoxious people PERIOD

If you are heading back to the neighborly East Boston via the Blue Line that  a.m PERIOD train will have to wait for the last of the Green and Orange Lines before your voyage under the sea PERIOD Chances are even if you make the secondtolast train you will be waiting  minutes for it to come PERIOD

Without going into the deficiencies of the Orange Red and fabled Silver Line the point is clear PERIOD Extending the hours of a mediocre product is helpful since people can stay out later PERIOD What is not beneficial is that the T is not getting any more efficient with longer hours PERIOD If anything Bostonians should expect a less functional transit system when this trial takes effect this spring PERIOD
