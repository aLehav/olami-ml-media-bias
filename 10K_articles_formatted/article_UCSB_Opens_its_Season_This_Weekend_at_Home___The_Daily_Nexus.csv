With the graduation of its batting average leader Jessica Soria UCSB will look to the only other player to bat over . last year Sophomore infielder Arianna Palomares PERIOD As a freshman Palomares was a huge offensive surge as she reeled in  hits and had an average of . overall ranking her second on the team behind Soria PERIOD

The presence of Palomares last year beautifully complemented the smallball style of play that the Gauchos present by getting on base and creating scoring opportunities for the team PERIOD

Another player who is sure to make some noise for Santa Barbara this weekend is junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom PERIOD Wisdom a former Big West Freshman of the year and All Big West team selection is a doublesided knife for the Gauchos on the diamond with outstanding defense and offense PERIOD

Her defense in the circle is dominating but it is not limited to pitching as the coaching staff is no stranger to sticking the junior in the outfield on days that she doesnt pitch or even after they bring in another pitcher PERIOD This strategy used by head coach Brie Galicinao is without a doubt to keep her on the field for offense PERIOD
