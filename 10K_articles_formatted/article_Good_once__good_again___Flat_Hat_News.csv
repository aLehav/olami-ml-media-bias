8425,2023-11-05,"williamsburg is ripe with shopping opportunities  New Town the Williamsburg Premium Outlets boutiques in Colonial Williamsburg and even Goodwill are all popular choices for students at the College of William and Mary PERIOD

However there is a lesserknown yet arguably more rewarding shopping opportunity close by local consignment shops PERIOD People or consigners bring in clothing  often vintage or highend designer brands accessories and home decor  and the consignment shop purchases the items and resells them PERIOD The consigner and the shop both make a profit off the sale and the customer who ends up buying the products is able to find something unique at an affordable price PERIOD

I want to help people find a way to recycle their wardrobe without spending too much money said Nina Watkins owner of Twice as Nice Consignment Boutique PERIOD

Twice as Nice is located just over two miles from campus and already sees significant student traffic Watkins said PERIOD Its website states that it carries fashionable like new clothing for women and children along with stylish wearable accessories. my customers want to look good but they dont want to spend retail prices Watkins said PERIOD

Twice as Nice encourages local women to consign their gently worn highend clothing and use the money made to purchase new clothing at the store PERIOD The women are effectively recycling and swapping their wardrobes rather than spending money on brand new clothing PERIOD

We focus a lot on building a solid relationship with the Williamsburg community Watkins said PERIOD Our goal is to always have great prices and products. another local consignment shop is The Wardrobe located five miles from the College in the Village Shops at the Kingsmill Shopping Plaza PERIOD The eclectic little shop has been in business since  selling a wide variety of highend designer and vintage womens clothing and accessories PERIOD

All ranges of customers can find something they like here at a price they can afford owner Cassandra Dennison said PERIOD Anyone from a student to the owner of a company. we have a really good local following but new people discover us every day Dennison said PERIOD Its a lot of fun because you never know what people and products will walk through the door. consigners at The Wardrobe receive  percent of the selling price and customers can get up to  percent off already affordable prices due to consistent instore sales PERIOD

Despite the wide range of affordable highend clothing Dennison noted that The Wardrobe has seen a bit of a decrease in traffic due to the increase of shopping venues in the Williamsburg area PERIOD With the constantly expanding Williamsburg Premium Outlets it is easy for small locallyowned shops to fall by the wayside PERIOD

We want to build our relationship with William and Mary students Dennison said PERIOD Were considering moving closer to the College at some point. dennison says its important for local businesses to give back to the community PERIOD Because of this The Wardrobe donates a lot of clothing to Transitions Family Violence Services a domestic violence shelter and organization in order to help local women in need PERIOD

I opened The Wardrobe because I hated my desk job and wanted to do something that I loved Dennison said PERIOD Ever since then weve been helping women find clothes they love at good prices. tara Marable also opened her shop The Vintage Rabbit in an attempt to fulfill a dream PERIOD Marable had always wanted to open her own store and opening a consignment shop was a great way for her to carve out a niche in the community PERIOD

Also only about five miles from campus The Vintage Rabbit sells furniture and home decor PERIOD While students from the College may not be willing to buy a daybed or china cabinet for their dorm rooms the shop carries a wide variety of smaller items such as tea sets small sofas and vases and receives a significant amount of student traffic PERIOD

We see quite a few students especially around the time when everyone is moving in employee Ashley Rogers said PERIOD

Each price tag has three dates and three prices on it  the shop decreases the price of each item by  percent every  days after it is first put out on the sales floor PERIOD This system ensures that customers can find a piece in their price range PERIOD

Something that makes us special and that customers really love is that were constantly rearranging the store PERIOD We rotate the furniture daily Rogers said PERIOD It looks different every time they come in even if its the same stuff just arranged in new ways and being used differently. even though most of its furniture is older The Vintage Rabbits employees are always doing their best to keep things fresh PERIOD

We were one of the first area consignment shops to start loading pictures of our products on Facebook and that was really helpful for bringing shoppers in Rogers said PERIOD They could already see pieces they liked online and that would bring them into the store. good once good again  Marable had always wanted to open her own store and opening a consignment shop was a great way for her to carve out a niche in the community PERIOD Also only about five miles from campus The Vintage Rabbit sells furniture and home decor PERIOD While students
