An unusual cast of characters came to Kennedy Theater stage a
couple of days ago as Jim Gamble awakened them for his show  Gamble a master puppeteer has been amusing audiences at
the Kennedy Theater for almost  consecutive years PERIOD

The word  may bring to mind a childs amusement but
puppets are not just for children PERIOD In fact it is believed that
during the Middle Ages puppets first began performing in churches PERIOD
They were used to tell stories from the Bible PERIOD

Puppets being great comedians were eventually banished from
the church PERIOD They then appeared on street corners and fairs amusing
audiences with their playful antics PERIOD

 said Gamble PERIOD

Present day puppetry is used extensively in conjunction with
live theater and recorded media PERIOD Disney he said is using a lot
more puppetry in its productions both at the parks and in shows
like  on Broadway PERIOD

Just recently Gamble toured and brought to life the popular BBC
childrens series  He said it took over five
months building the staging alone PERIOD He performed the show in front
of live audiences across the United States PERIOD

He added that there are many advantages that puppets have over
people in performances PERIOD He didnt specify what that was but one
could imagine that there are not too many puppet divas out there
and puppets unlike people are always on time PERIOD

Gamble also believes that college students interested in
studying the theater should learn about puppetry in order to
increase their opportunities for employment PERIOD And for those in
elementary education the art form can also be used to enhance
learning in the classroom PERIOD

The master puppeteer said in an email interview that many of his
productions have been designed specifically to foster music
education and cultural enrichment PERIOD He said that he firmly believes
there is a market for good applicable and entertaining work with
puppetry PERIOD

So just how hard is it to manipulate a marionette Gamble likens
it to learning how to play the piano PERIOD For some they can never
master the art PERIOD For others it takes years PERIOD

He wrote 

Then there is the art of creating the puppet itself PERIOD A true
puppeteer can not just walk into the puppet shop and buy a
character they have to design it themselves PERIOD

 Gamble said PERIOD 

Christy AhSing a local puppeteer on Oahu said of Gamble 

Gamble said that he usually has a puppeteer practice for hours
with the marionettes in front of a mirror PERIOD He then has the
puppeteer make the marionettes walk without sagging and without
looking down at them PERIOD

After they have mastered that the puppeteer must learn how to
perform a variety of emotions with the puppet character without
using any words PERIOD Gamble wants them to be able to project the
feeling from the puppet character and to be able to do it almost
automatically PERIOD

With almost  years of performing and about  productions in
his repertoire Gamble just might retire someday PERIOD He said that he
is  to eventually manage his
production company and continue long after he has retired PERIOD His
puppet shows are timeless and the artistry combined with the
entertainment will never go out of style PERIOD

It is suffice to say that the audiences who have grown up
watching him perform would always miss that extra quality only a
true puppeteer master like Gamble can bring to the stage PERIOD
