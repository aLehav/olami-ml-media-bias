UConn redshirt junior guard Sam Cassell Jr PERIOD dribbles to the basket during the Huskies preseason exhibition game against the University of New Haven at XL Center in Hartford Connecticut on Nov PERIOD   PERIOD Bailey WrightThe Daily Campus

As basketball season begins its always good to get some predictions out there before the season officially starts PERIOD Our basketball beat writers answered some questions on what theyre looking forward to this season PERIOD

Sports Editor Matt Zampini and staff writer Elan DeCarlo take a look at the mens team while Associate Sports Editor Dan Madigan and staff writer Spencer Mayfield will be covering the womens team PERIOD

Matt Zampini The Huskies are extremely deep this season PERIOD It wouldnt surprise me if Ollie used  or  guys a game PERIOD So I think its going to be hard for anyone to average over  points a game but Im going to say Rodney Purvis will lead the Huskies in scoring PERIOD He said after the last exhibition game that he was ready to lead this team and Ollie said he wants to run on offense this season PERIOD

Purvis is one of the best players in transition and I think hell get a lot of points from transition PERIOD Plus his jump shot has improved from a year ago PERIOD

ElanPaolo DeCarlo This is a borderline impossible question to answer PERIOD Its easy to imagine a different scoring leader from game to game PERIOD The safe bet is to go with Rodney Purvis as hes the returning leader but Im going with Daniel Hamilton.The sophomore forward is perhaps the most versatile player on the team and should figure to be a leader in minutes PERIOD I can easily see him knocking down more threes and getting to the foul line more to pump up his scoring volume PERIOD

Dan Madigan Breanna Stewart will lead the team in scoring again this year PERIOD As deep and talented as this team Stewart is the centerpiece that makes this team so dangerous PERIOD She can score in so many ways from all over the court and theres no reason she wont do it again as she goes for another National Player of the Year award and her fourthstraight national championship PERIOD

Spencer Mayfield I am going to go out on a limb here and say that Breanna Stewart will lead her team in scoring PERIOD She is the best player in the country and it is her senior season PERIOD Stewarts offensive game has really developed over her career here at UConn PERIOD She is the most versatile player on the team as she has the ability to score in the post and on the perimeter PERIOD She can also put the ball on the floor and get to anywhere she wants on the court PERIOD She will once again be a nightmare for opponents to match up with PERIOD

Matt Zampini Ive been on the record as not a huge fan of this guy but I think Omar Calhoun might make a comeback this year after a lost junior season PERIOD In his freshman year he started  games and averaged . points and . rebounds per game game PERIOD In his next two season he averaged . and . points per game PERIOD He has looked much more confident in the exhibition games and that is what its going to take for him PERIOD

All it is going to take is for him to knock some shots down early in the season to keep that confidence high PERIOD Calhoun wont let his season go to waste PERIOD

ElanPaolo DeCarlo Steven Enoch will shock UConn fans with how ready he is as a freshman PERIOD If theres a flaw with this team its in the frontcourt PERIOD The returning players Amida Brimah Phil Nolan and Kentan Facey have all reached their ceiling PERIOD We know who they are PERIOD Enoch represents an unknown commodity and his potential is limitless PERIOD Hes massive runs well has good hands and has been described by teammates and Ollie as being a sponge PERIOD

A coachable  year old with his physical skills at the center position is something that cannot be overlooked PERIOD Expect him to be the first big man off the bench before  begins PERIOD

Dan Madigan Even though she will miss the first few games of this season with a thumb injury I expect Natalie Butler to turn a lot of heads this season PERIOD The 6foot5inch center sat out last season after transferring from Georgetown where she won the Big East Freshman of the Year award and averaged . points per game and . rebounds per game PERIOD

If there is any weakness on this team its the lack of a big post player but Butler will fix that as soon as she returns to action with her incredible size and skill PERIOD

Spencer Mayfield Gabby Williams will surprise a lot of people this year with her athletic ability PERIOD Williams was moved to the forward position for the first time in her career as a freshman and did a solid job making the adjustment PERIOD

Now in her sophomore season I think Williams will look even more comfortable at the position PERIOD She was named the American Conference Sixth Player of the year last season for her contributions of . points per game and . rebounds per game PERIOD I expect Williams to be UConns best rebounder this season especially if she makes it into the starting lineup PERIOD
