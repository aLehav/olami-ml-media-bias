As social media reignites interest in Astrology its future remains uncertain

While many of the concepts originally proposed in astrology were debunked or challenged by modern science as much as  of Americans believe in it PERIOD Astrology is an ancient form of predicting realworld events off of the positioning of the stars in the sky as it relates to Earth PERIOD

Unfortunately the original concepts of astrology have been largely lost by modern audiences PERIOD With astrology once again becoming popular with social media users the field has two potential futures one of tradition or internet platforms capitalizing from inaccurate monthly horoscopes PERIOD

Fortunately astrology is once again picking up popularity with social media users PERIOD When asked what drives people to astrology even though science conflicts with it Truth knowing there is something real and there is an order to the universe Lance Ferguson said an avid student and reader of astrology since  PERIOD

Horoscopes as theyre known today were first introduced to American media in the 1930s and eventually became marketed towards women PERIOD These horoscopes focus on a persons sun sign the sign most people associate with their birthday PERIOD Women today are still twice as likely as men to believe in astrology PERIOD

The issue with modernday astrology is that many people rely on the basic horoscopes created by the media PERIOD These horoscopes dont follow the traditional chart form of astrology because they only discuss a persons sun sign PERIOD This can create an incomplete picture of a persons real horoscope for a given time due to the loss of other important factors such as their moon sign rising sign and houses PERIOD

Astrology is complicated PERIOD Sun sign astrology horoscopes is like looking at one ingredient in a recipe and telling you what it will make PERIOD This is the problem with newspaper stuff PERIOD Its all garbage and I think not even written by an astrologer Ferguson noted PERIOD

By several accounts Ferguson appears to be correct with magazines such as Teen Vogue and Cosmopolitan having horoscope sections PERIOD While these magazines have real astrologers writing them Smithsonian Magazine reported that many horoscopes in the media were historically written by writers with little knowledge on the subject PERIOD

Ferguson runs Skywatch Astrology a website that uses astrology as a tool to guide people in their decisionmaking process throughout life PERIOD Based on planetary alignments people can either have Kiss days where the overall outcome of the day is good and people should take risks as well as Quack days where people should expect excess stress in their lives PERIOD These days are the same for everybody but individual signs also have their own predictions PERIOD

I almost think the only way to prove astrology is to get a personal reading of your birth chart Ferguson explained PERIOD Traditionally astrology utilizes all of the planets in what are known as charts PERIOD A birth chart requires a person to know where when and at what time preferably to the minute they were born PERIOD They detail specific information about a person including their strengths weaknesses and personality traits PERIOD Many astrologers can forecast when major events happen in a persons life based on their birth chart PERIOD

Much like a clock a chart has  houses and each house represents a specific outcome of events determined by how its ruling planet corresponds with another PERIOD The planets moon and sun within a house can determine the events of a persons life at a given time PERIOD

The sun sign most commonly discussed in horoscopesdetermines someones identity and selfvalue PERIOD Two other very important signs on a chart are the moon and rising signs PERIOD

The moon sign determines information on someones character and ambitions PERIOD Since the moon moves through one sign every  days it is important to know where it is within your chart to provide an accurate prediction of events PERIOD

Finally the last of the three most important signs is the rising PERIOD The rising sign refers to what sign was rising on the other side of the world at the time of somebodys birth PERIOD This sign determines someones outward appearance what sign someone appears to be to others PERIOD

Fortunately astrology is once again picking up popularity with social media users PERIOD When asked what drives people to astrology even though science conflicts with it Truth knowing there is something real and there is an order to the universe Ferguson noted PERIOD

Astrology is at a crossroads with many looking into unspecific heavily commercialized forms of it for guidance and others learning how to read charts and predict specific events from the Internet much like Ferguson did when he first began studying it in  PERIOD

As astrology continues to be picked up by this generation Ferguson hopes that the truth about it comes out PERIOD
