5121,2023-11-04,"pitlick led the Gophers with  points last year PERIOD

by  Jack WarrickPublished  November  

Its an old clich that when players become upperclassmen something changes in the way they play act or lead PERIOD

For Rem Pitlick who has led on the stat sheet the past two seasons with  total points in two seasons and seven games hes just going to keep on doing what hes been doing PERIOD

I guess I dont know the word but whatever comes with it obviously like people say the younger guys are looking at you and stuff I dont really think that changes much for me personally PERIOD I just try to lead by example PERIOD Im not much of a rah rah guy Pitlick said PERIOD

Pitlick is tied in points this season with sophomore defenseman Clayton Phillips with five points through the first seven games PERIOD Pitlick tallied the game tying goal in Minnesotas victory over Wisconsin Friday  a  victory for the first win in Big Ten play PERIOD It was a power play goal and Pitlick has had a knack this year for producing in special teams situations PERIOD

Obviously he brings a spark to the table with his speed and his shot and his hands PERIOD I think a lot of guys counter off his speed said defenseman Tyler Nanne PERIOD He does a really good job leading from the up front. all of Pitlicks points have been scored either on the power play or the penalty kill PERIOD He has four points on the power play and one on the penalty kill PERIOD

One hes going back to center for the first time so hes playing a 200foot game and hes playing against other teams top players said head coach Bob Motzko PERIOD Rem wants to be part of the offense PERIOD When weve talked Ive told him those are two worlds being a top center playing top minutes against other teams top players and then that offense PERIOD Once those two worlds find each other hell be a special player. pitlick had success in his first two years with the program but in the halfway point of his career with Minnesota Don Lucia resigned and Motzko and his staff came into the picture PERIOD

Theyre still getting to know us were still getting to know them PERIOD Obviously theres differences but its been a nice fresh breath of air Pitlick said PERIOD

Freshmen and underclassmen have made their impact felt early on in the season as there was at least one freshman on the top three forward lines in last weeks series finale PERIOD Phillips a sophomore defensemen ties Pitlick for points this season with five assists PERIOD Phillips only skated for the second half of last season after leaving the juniors for DivisionI hockey PERIOD

I think Sammy Walkers playing well too PERIOD Hes really fast and he brings a lot of skill Pitlick said PERIOD I think obviously theyre coming along and its an exciting group for us. the Gophers have dropped four out of the last five games but the series in Madison Pitlick said showed promise for better play moving forward PERIOD

It was good to get our first Big Ten win obviously its a fun building to play in the Gophers versus the Badgers Pitlick said PERIOD So I think we learned that we can play with any team PERIOD I think we knew that from the beginning PERIOD We have a lot of talent on this roster and were just going to keep looking forward to getting better every day and I think the results will take care of themselves. pitlick and the Gophers will start a sixgame home stretch on Friday PERIOD They will play St PERIOD Lawrence at 3M Arena at Mariucci in a twogame series Friday and Saturday PERIOD
