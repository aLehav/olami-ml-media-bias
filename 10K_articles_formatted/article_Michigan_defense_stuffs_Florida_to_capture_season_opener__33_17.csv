ARLINGTON Tex PERIOD  The first pick came then the second PERIOD

Suddenly the Michigan football team was trailing by a touchdown with its starting quarterback taking a seat on the sideline PERIOD Then came a blocked punt and the game was at risk of spiraling out of control PERIOD

And yet the 11thranked Wolverines   a team ample with youth after returning at best five starters  threw their inexperience out the window recovering to score  secondhalf points and defeat No PERIOD  Florida  in the AdvoCare Classic at ATT Stadium PERIOD

I mean we didnt hang our heads said freshman wide receiver Tarik Black PERIOD You know when we face adversity we just got to get back to it get back up PERIOD

Really Coach just emphasized coming out and pretty much clearing our heads and just coming out and doing what we do and thats play Michigan football PERIOD And I think thats what we did. the secondhalf resurgence started with redshirt junior quarterback Wilton Speight as he went 5for7 with  yards to set up junior running back Karan Higdon for a threeyard touchdown rush on the opening drive PERIOD

Redshirt freshman kicker Quinn Nordin slowly built Michigans lead for the rest of the third quarter nailing a  and 50yard field goal after two fumble recoveries to put the Wolverines ahead  entering the final frame PERIOD

Then the defense took over as it had the entire game PERIOD

Florida  failed to score a single point in the second half eventually replacing Feleipe Franks with Malik Zaire at quarterback PERIOD

The Wolverinesdefense tallied stop after stop  holding the Gators to just  yards conceding just three points and capping the day off with a sack of Zaire that turned into a fumble recovery in Floridas end zone PERIOD

I seen a bunch of guys play like men today Bush said PERIOD  We just had a bunch of guys rise to the occasion PERIOD I cant express how happy I am and proud of those guys I am. and if not for the defensive unit the first half could have easily gotten out of hand PERIOD

Though he eventually returned linebacker and defensive captain Mike McCray started the game on the sideline for unknown reasons and sophomore linebacker Devin Bush was nearly ejected for targeting on the first play of the game PERIOD

Roughly  minutes later after finding freshman wide receiver Tarik Black for a 46yard touchdown to give Michigan a  lead with just over three minutes left in the first quarter  going  yards on three plays in just  seconds  Speights day took a turn for the worse PERIOD

The Gators turned his two picksixes into a  lead despite failing to score a single offensive touchdown and tallying just  total yards in the first half PERIOD

And with the picksixes came the quarterback controversy PERIOD Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh went with Speight to start the game but two consecutive interceptions landed him on the bench with just under  minutes left in the first half PERIOD

Fifthyear senior John OKorn took over only to watch sophomore Will Hart have his punt blocked after OKorns first offensive drive ended with a three and out PERIOD

OKorn was given only one more offensive drive after the punt block as Speight reclaimed his duties under center for the remainder of the game and finished 11for25 with  yards one touchdown and two interceptions PERIOD

Theres a lot to learn from it Harbaugh said PERIOD Theres really good things to learn from it PERIOD We already have talked about some of them and there will be more to learn from it PERIOD But hes experiencing it PERIOD Thats big PERIOD

And then you know its always astonished me you know with quarterbacks PERIOD Its a sign PERIOD It really is a sign when a quarterback can have something really bad go something really bad happen and come back from it. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
