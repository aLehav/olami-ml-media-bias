Booth Library received a grant in August for  from the Office of Broadband Regional Engagement for Adoption  Digital Equity READY program in order to develop digital literacy programs for surrounding communities PERIOD

During the spring semester of  at some of Easterns staff at Booth Library Zach Newell as Dean of Library Services Beth Heldebrandt as Public Relations Director Stacey L PERIOD KnightDavis as Head of Circulation Services and Nate Carlson as Digital Literacy Coordinator together applied to receive money from the statewide grant program Broadband READY PERIOD

It was mostly designed to provide opportunities for increased infrastructure throughout Illinois to provide access to rural communities and in some of the regions that may be funding the distribution of laptops to undeserved communities PERIOD

But the direction we sort of took it with or they sort of took it with was a direction of education PERIOD Its no good to provide access to the Internet access to these technologies if people arent equipped to use them arent equipped to use them in productive or responsible or effective ways Carlson said PERIOD

Digital literacy is the ability to have safe informed and active participation in digital technologies PERIOD This is a core part of the curriculum taught in the program along with enabling students and patrons to be active safe and informed participants PERIOD The course is also meant to inform participants in digital media and enable them to use digital technology to advocate for themselves and their community PERIOD

It is also important that users understand digital footprints feeling safe and secure online informational literacy and fake news literacy giving people the skills to determine their own bias and determine the bias of the media they consume PERIOD

To start the process money went towards instructing around  total educators who were trained from various partners in a workshop offered at Booth Library over the summer PERIOD The rest of the money went to those grant partners to provide technology and pay for the instructors of workshops PERIOD

So far three workshops are being offered at Effingham Library as well as workshops at the Mattoon Public Library and Charleston Carnegie Library PERIOD The program will also be offered to University Foundation instructors for the fall semester for Eastern freshmen and Lakeland College is a grant partner as well PERIOD

Carlson shared a story he had heard from one of the Lakeland College GED instructors in which he said They had a woman come in their GED class and she said Ive been working in construction for  years PERIOD I dont have my job anymore. she didnt know how to use a computer she didnt know how to use Microsoft word use the Internet and this woman who had a steady paycheck for so long just trying to get by and survive in this very tumultuous economy lacked the skills to even take the GED course because the GED course was online. he finished off with And that for me paints the picture for me that people are getting left behind because a lack of digital literacy. for adults adjusting to a digital changing world colleges can provide the resources to help PERIOD Newell when interviewed mentioned efforts at Eastern to help students keep up with changing technology PERIOD

The pandemic allowed government emergency education relief funds to purchase  laptops along with webcams digital cameras and other equipment to address the digital equity gap to continue with classes online going into the fall semester and be distributed through the library PERIOD

 was also used previously to convert an instructional studio in Thomas Hall to give instructions on how to install and use software on laptops after checking out technology from hired on graduate assistants there PERIOD

We work in tandem PERIOD The whole library itself is studentminded and studentoriented PERIOD Between circulation helping with interlibrary loan requests like journals that we dont have library technology helping students in the fishbowl and technology help checking out dongles in the CSI space that can help with technology with the actual instruction of the software and hardware said Newell PERIOD
