Civility should outweigh eating crow

MATTHEW WAITE is a senior newseditorial major Daily Nebraskan Senior News Reporter and Opinion Editor PERIOD

Oh mother I hate to tell you this PERIOD It pains my heart PERIOD I thought that college was supposed to educate people PERIOD Round them out PERIOD Make them thinkers PERIOD

But oh here in the last months of my collegiate education I cant help but feel saddened PERIOD It seems that civility and the ability to think before your mouth opens has gone away PERIOD I realize all the world is not like college but I thought this place was supposed to be better PERIOD

It isnt PERIOD

Someone  and you better be thankful for this  whose name and phone number I know but wont publish for all the world decided to take it upon his drunk self to call one of my columnists and open his mouth long before he thought PERIOD And he did it with a group of laughing folks in his residence hall room PERIOD

And it isnt even over anything like race or gender or something important and fiery PERIOD

Its about the Dukes of Hazzard for crying out loud PERIOD

But I believe his words should appear in print so the good folks on East Campus can defend themselves against such wonderful thinkers like this joker PERIOD

This was transcribed from Todd Munsons answering machine Tuesday morning PERIOD



Wow PERIOD

In one answering machine message this gentleman managed to harken each and every negative stereotype any student has ever held about East Campus PERIOD

Does this bother anyone else

Have we as the human race gone from thoughtful meaningful public debate about the days issues to veiled threats and obscene tirades on peoples answering machines

Where did we go wrong

Is civility dead Is discussion a thing of the past Can we criticize anything without using a word that ends in uck and doesnt start with s or f

And arent there more pertinent things to talk about After the chalking bombardment of letters to the editor they slowed to a trickle PERIOD And in that time we discussed serious issues such as free speech and morality PERIOD We even ran a story about amateur strip night at a local club with a fleshy photo and no one batted an eye PERIOD

But mess with the Dukes and look out PERIOD

Have we replaced intellect with television

Shame on you PERIOD
