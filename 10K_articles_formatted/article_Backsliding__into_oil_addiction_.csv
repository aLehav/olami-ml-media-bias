5398,2014-10-20,"since I moved within biking distance of campus more than a year ago I havent been fueling up my car that much PERIOD So I was a bit shocked when I visited the pumps yesterday and discovered just how far gas prices had fallen PERIOD Less than . a gallon Had I just been transported back to Massachusetts

No my trusty old Honda Accord and I were still in Silicon Valley We were merely witnessing the local consequences of falling oil prices worldwide PERIOD

For thefirst time in four years the global price of a barrel of oil  precursor to gasoline among many other things  has fallen below  PERIOD Thatsa  percent price drop since oil was selling for  a barrel back in June PERIOD It seems thatrising production in the United States andfalling demand in Europe have caused prices to drop in spite of geopolitical uncertainty surrounding oil producing regions in the Middle East PERIOD

Youd think as someone about to swipe her credit card at the pump Id think this price drop was good news PERIOD A dollar of gas now literally goes further than it did a month ago PERIOD

But shortterm savings on the consumer end only foreshadow longterm costs in our economic and environmental future PERIOD Thats because when oil prices fall people tend to start using more oil PERIOD

Remember when oil prices hit147 per barrel back in  and gas prices were at an alltime high Most American consumers dont seem to either PERIOD Last month as gas prices fell we started buying less efficient cars againSUV sales soared while hybrid sales sank andaverage vehicle gas mileage made its biggest drop since  PERIOD Theefficiency of our vehicles seems to neatly track gas prices and savings at the pump quickly evaporate into larger fuel tanks PERIOD

When oil prices fall we also tend to forget that oil is in fact a limited commodity PERIOD We forget that eventually we will run out of this magical energycontaining substance that someone has transformed into the fuel for our vehicles thematerials that make up our belongings andeven the food that we eat PERIOD We forget that oil which takes millennia to form from the bodies of tiny animals and plants is the very definition of a nonrenewable resource PERIOD

Because we forget we dont think about alternatives PERIOD We dont think about how we will fuel goods and services when oil prices inevitably climb again PERIOD And even though theres only a small direct economic tie the electric car market between the oil market and the renewable electricity market people tend to be more dismissive of wind and solar when they perceive fossil fuels as cheap PERIOD Falling oil prices stifle innovation and trap us in the status quo PERIOD

Its also much easier to ignore the environmental costs of oil when using it just seems so economical PERIOD Despite the scientific consensus linking human fossil fuel use to carbon emissions and in turn those emissions to a changing climate companies and politicians still have to convince stockholders and voters that dramatic immediate changes to their bottom line are worthwhile PERIOD Thats a tough sell unless oils expense is so high that its use becomes cost prohibitive PERIOD

Still the current drop in oil prices gives us a unique opportunity to transition our economic system into one that more realistically captures the environmental impacts of our fossil fuel use PERIOD Though our politicians wont dare broach the subject why not institute a carbon tax now Fill in the gap between the recent relatively high gas prices and the falling prices now with a tax margin that goes in part back to consumers as a rebate PERIOD Use the rest of the revenues to encourage groups likeTransition U.S PERIOD to keep envisioning and preparing for a world without oil PERIOD

As an environmental scientist its easy for me to be drawn to the ecological reasons for transitioning away from fossil fuels PERIOD Not only do I worry about the longterm and frighteningly unpredictable effects of climate change but Im also all too aware of the shortterm local costs ofoil spillsdrilling accidents andthe like PERIOD And I know Im not alone in worrying about the geopolitical consequences of buying oil overseas PERIOD

But my greatest worry stems from the fact that I am a human living in a time of energy wealth and who knows that that era is coming to a close PERIOD We will run out of oil It is merely a question of when PERIOD And allowing shortterm price drops to suck us back into our comfortable fossil fuel addiction is so foolish that it may prove lethal PERIOD
