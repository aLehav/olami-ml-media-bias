While the University of Cincinnati is the secondlargest university in Ohio its employees rank No PERIOD  in political contributions PERIOD

Political contributions which are tracked by the Federal Election Commission when more than  is given to a political entity are expected to reach alltime highs this year with an estimation of more than  trillion to be spent nationwide by the end of the presidential election cycle PERIOD

Money is absolutely important to any election outcome said Patrick Miller associate professor of political science at UC PERIOD But the two things that matter are first to spend enough money to be competitive and second to spend that money strategically in a manner that maximizes its impact with the optimal message. a high number of donors does not indicate potential election outcomes as much as it indicates grassroots support Miller said PERIOD

The Board of Trustees led all members of the UC community with  in contributions   of which went to Republicans PERIOD

Ohio Gov PERIOD John Kasich who began his term in  has appointed board members Thomas Cassady William Portman III and Geraldine Warner during his time in office PERIOD

The correlation between trustee appointments and hefty political donations is very strong Miller said PERIOD Political figures often reward their financial supporters with appointments PERIOD

Of the trustees who donated thus far in the  election cycle Gary Heiman leads the way with  PERIOD Warner donated a total of  to various Republican candidates and organizations while Stanley Chesley gave  splitting the sum between opposing political parties PERIOD

Many individuals and organizations give to both sides to both parties to opposing candidates said John Bryan vice provost at UC PERIOD I can only speculate that such contributors really want access to the powers in both of those parties to whichever candidate wins PERIOD Is that cynical opportunism  or just good business

Portman III is the forthlargest donor on the board spending  on political contributions in this election season alone PERIOD

Political appointments like trustee positions are often nothing more than political patronage or spoils for the supporters of a winning candidate he said PERIOD

Ideally a governor will appoint a person who has an interest in education and an unbiased view of how the university should work Miller said but this is not always the case PERIOD

Trustees however are not the only members of the UC community doling out cash this election season PERIOD Employees of the university professors and administrators alike also exercise their right to donate political capital to politicians and interested parties PERIOD

The Ohio State University ranks No PERIOD  behind UC with a total of  in political contributions made by its employees PERIOD

Although professors and educators at the university donate large sums to political entities Miller said it is not necessarily unethical PERIOD

Professional people are typically capable of separating their personal political selves from their professional selves Miller said PERIOD Just because I have political preferences as a political science professor and contribute to candidates I prefer that does not mean I teach from my political perspective. professors instructing students on political ideologies should promote students independent critical thinking not a particular party or candidate Bryan said PERIOD

Bryan who gave  to the campaigns for President Barack Obama and Sen PERIOD Sherrod Brown DOhio said professors who contribute to campaigns are not acting unprofessional PERIOD However political proselytizing in educational capacities crosses an ethical boundary PERIOD

The Collective Bargaining Agreement between the university and faculty explicitly warns faculty to separate personal opinions and beliefs with their professional lives PERIOD

It warns them to ensure that when they speak on individuals on matters unrelated to their faculty responsibilities they must ensure that they make clear that they are not speaking on behalf of the university Bryan said PERIOD Faculty should not use their positions of authority and power to advance personal political agendas. eugene Somoza professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience donated the largest amount of political contributions out of all employees   to several Democratic political organizations and candidates including Obama PERIOD

Somozas wife Peggy donated  to various Democrats and Democraticsupporting organizations PERIOD

Bryan believes students should be aware of why donors contribute money to organizations and candidates in the first place PERIOD
