What Askov Finlayson

Where  N PERIOD First St. Minneapolis

When it comes to shopping local in Minneapolis women have a world of opportunity PERIOD Men on the other hand not so much PERIOD Menswear retail in the Twin Cities has a tendency to be singular PERIOD The few boutiques that do exist cater to a limiting aesthetic high fashion and exorbitantly priced labels PERIOD Meaning theres not much middle ground for dudes that dont necessarily identify as fashionistos but still want to flaunt their outfits PERIOD

This has all changed with the recent opening of the new North Loop boutique Askov Finlayson. pERIOD And we have our Gov PERIOD Mark Dayton to thank for it he fathered the two creators Andrew and Eric PERIOD

Andrew  and Eric  Daytons schooling primed them for careers far outside the realm of hospitality or retail PERIOD Andrew thought he might turn his law degree into a prosecution career and Eric was slated to take onthe corporate business world PERIOD However in  a somewhat nontraditional impulse investment an enormous and historic brick and timber warehouse precipitated an entrepreneurial journey that would produce a restaurant the Bachelor Farmer a bar Marvel Bar and finally the last piece to their ambitions Askov Finlayson PERIOD

We bought the building without real plans Andrew said PERIOD It was a canvas for us and what we were going to do together PERIOD We saw an opportunity in the realm of vibrant retail and thought that the space with big open windows would be ideal for a store. the store charmingly named after a familiar intersection from childhood trips to their familys Lake Vermilion cabin  carries a diverse array of products but with a clear emphasis on the menswear PERIOD Though the brands are respected the Daytons are clear about the first and foremost importance of their product which for the record they handpicked entirely PERIOD

We had an idea of some of the stuff we wanted to carry that wasnt available in the Twin Cities Eric Dayton said PERIOD We have trouble pinning down what our look is but its mainly concerned with quality and structure PERIOD You have to get dressed in the morning and if youre going to get dressed it might as well be in something quality. this transfers into a lot of Minnesotafriendly gear like flannels quilted jackets and sturdy wool outerwear PERIOD Most of the merchandise looks perfectly fitted to the woodsy visual aesthetic of the space PERIOD The brothers are especially proud of conducting the interior designwork themselves PERIOD Additionally there are miscellaneous gift items for sale as well such as pillows umbrellas and a limited amount of womens wear though in the future they plan to expand their offerings to females PERIOD

Spending nearly seven days a week splitting time among their three businesses one would think the brothers might feel a little overwhelmed or burnt out but things seem pretty calm PERIOD

It would have been ambitious to tackle any one of these projects Andrew Dayton said PERIOD Weve definitely got our hands full but its the people our staff PERIOD Our role is more top down and they all really excel at their individual areas. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
