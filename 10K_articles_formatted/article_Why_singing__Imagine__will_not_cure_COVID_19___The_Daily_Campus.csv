March  was a stressful day for the world PERIOD Europe induced a 30day travel ban the NBA season got suspended and while my phone was blowing up with this news I was struggling to finish a project before the start of spring break PERIOD I had a lot on my mind being aware of the increasing cases of COVID19 swirling across countries and dealing with the possibility that it might be my last week on campus for the semester PERIOD However juggling global crises and lastminute due dates soon became the least of my worries when the worst news of all arrived PERIOD

When the headline Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson test positive for coronavirus popped up on my screen it felt like the world had stopped spinning PERIOD Flashbacks of Woody the cowboy Forrest Gump and the beloved train conductor from The Polar Express came rushing through my mind and I immediately stopped everything I was doing as Tom Hanks health became my first priority PERIOD

Two weeks later an additional  cases have been reported in the U.S PERIOD with a stronger demand for tests PERIOD Although the amount of testing has significantly increased it still doesnt feel like enough to capture the entirety of infected victims some of whom do not even show visible symptoms PERIOD When our favorite celebrities test positive for COVID19 our immediate reaction is shock sorrow and perhaps anger at the universe for getting Hollywoods most wholesome man sick PERIOD It feels wrong to have felt like this now considering Tom Hanks net worth of  million PERIOD

Being rich and famous has its perks PERIOD For one thing youre rich PERIOD Alongside that people look up to you and no one wants to see their role model die PERIOD Therefore people in higher positions are first in line for getting tested while everyday inhabitants and medical workers struggle for the opportunity PERIOD Having access to better healthcare better doctors and better hospitals becomes very useful during times like these PERIOD It just sucks that it only applies to the top  PERIOD

Instead of using their readily available wealth to aid the current crisis some celebrities have taken it upon themselves to battle science with art PERIOD Last week Gal Gadot posted a compilation of her and fellow moguls singing John Lennons Imagine a song that I gladly enjoyed until then PERIOD What was supposed to be a moving piece ended up being a source of discomfiture PERIOD If anything being stared down by an Alist celebrity as they sing tonedeaf through a camera only brings the opposite of peaceful thinking PERIOD

The video gained more backlash than support with people interpreting it as a poor effort against the pandemic PERIOD Citizens have lost their jobs family members are dying and the last thing they want is someone singing about peace and hope within the comfort of their mansion PERIOD Lane Moore mocks the situation in a fairly sarcastic tweet

What if we did a modern version of We Are The World but its 20x as awkward filmed on iPhones most of the celebrities look like they hate that theyre in it and it solves nothing because this is a pandemic and not a war Omg yes

In better news Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively have since donated  million to food banks in North America as well as  of proceeds from Reynolds company Aviation Gin to recently unemployed bartenders PERIOD COVID19 has certainly had a detrimental impact on lowincome families and workers and its refreshing to see someone handle it appropriately PERIOD

Imagine is a good song but not good enough to solve a pandemic PERIOD Instead be like Ryan PERIOD Go donate PERIOD Sacrifice time to help someone out PERIOD Especially if youre a celebrity PERIOD
