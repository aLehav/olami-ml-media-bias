When tight end Jake Murphy decided to forego his senior year to enter the NFL draft he received many questions as to why PERIOD Trying to prove his doubters wrong Murphy was a top performer in the combines three cone and 20yard shuttle drills PERIOD His main goal was to be able to impress the scouts with his catching ability a good quality to have at the tight end position PERIOD
