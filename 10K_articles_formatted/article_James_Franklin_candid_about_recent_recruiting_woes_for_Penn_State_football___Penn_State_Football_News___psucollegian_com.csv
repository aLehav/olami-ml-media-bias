Head coach James Franklin speaks with the media during a press conference at Beaver Stadium Wednesday Feb PERIOD   PERIOD

This time last year Penn State recruits would have weekends circled on their calendars in which they would make the trip to visit the center of Pennsylvania to experience all the blueandwhite have to offer PERIOD

In the age of coronavirus though those experiences are simply unattainable for high schoolers aiming to play on the next level  as they must now make their decisions based off of what they already know about the contending programs PERIOD

And this has had an extremely negative effect on the Nittany Lions recruiting class of  as the top program in the Northeast currently holds the thirty-third ranked class in the nation according to the 247Sports composite rating PERIOD

Now focused on his squads upcoming seasonopener in late October James Franklin is still prioritizing getting the  class back on track  stressing theres still time to do so PERIOD

This class is not done but up to this point we havent gotten it done Franklin said PERIOD We have not recruited up to the standard that we normally have. the Nittany Lions currently hold the seventh ranked  recruiting class in the Big Ten behind schools such as Nebraska Maryland and Minnesota according to the 247Sports composite rating PERIOD

Normally Penn State has reliable means of showcasing the campus and Beaver Stadium as well as the culture inside the program PERIOD

But now amid the coronavirus pandemic Franklin is missing out on the ability to demonstrate to recruits what it means to play football for the program PERIOD

Obviously you dont have official visits you dont have unofficial visits you didnt have the spring game and you didnt have spring practices Franklin said PERIOD

With State College being its own isolated community in the middle of the state Franklin and the rest of his coaching staff have found it difficult to replicate the atmosphere of Happy Valley for recruits who have never visited the college town PERIOD

Where were located its not like we have a bunch of recruits that live within an hour of campus Franklin said PERIOD This is a place youve got to come and see. out of the  commits for Penn State in this cycle  of them are outofstate prospects and none live within  miles of campus PERIOD

While he cant physically journey the recruiting trail this fall Franklin has made sure that he and his staff have exemplified the Penn State culture for potential commits as best they can in Zoom calls and other media PERIOD

Nothing about this is normal and weve got to make the best of the situation were dealt Franklin said PERIOD Youd like to still be able to provide some of that experience. and as prospects slim down their lists of their top schools with signing day slowly approaching the Penn State coaching staff realizes it may have to take some chances on players who have never stepped foot in State College PERIOD

Were gonna have to sign some kids that weve never had on campus Franklin said PERIOD

Theres still time to bolster the upcoming class but Franklin understands changes must be made in order to ensure the tables are turned PERIOD

Weve got to be able to make some strategic changes and find a way to get it done and be successful Franklin said PERIOD
