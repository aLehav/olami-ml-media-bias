5023,2023-11-04,"do war supporters see President Bush as only a leader for their fear

Published  September  

I was originally going to write this column on the pleasures of Super  mm film PERIOD Id mention the pleasant noise of the film projector and compare the colors of the Super  film projections to the colors newborn babies see PERIOD Id point how Super  film slows the pace of life and makes it possible to see a persons gait see each strand of a girls hair blow across her face and see how shadows seem more defined than they appear in real life PERIOD But that column will have to wait PERIOD This weekend is one of an early homecoming for the University of Minnesota but it is also one of crystallization of the current antiwar movement PERIOD

Instead of marching in a parade I will be riding a bus for  hours to get to Washington D.C. for what is anticipated to be the largest antiwar demonstration in the United States against the Iraq war PERIOD Im going largely out of curiosity PERIOD Does anybody have sympathy for the president Do war supporters see him only as a leader for their fear Do protestors even empathize with Bush as a human

In many ways I feel sorry for President Bush PERIOD I believe somewhere down inside of him there is a spark of humanity that realizes his crusades against homosexuals against innocent civilians of foreign and home origins the environment and against the future citizens of this country are wrong PERIOD Somewhere inside of him there is a boy who just likes to play baseball PERIOD But now President Bush and his like are caught in their own power struggles PERIOD Does President Bush cry at night

And in all of this who can blame Bush and his kind for taking advantage of the countrys collective apathy PERIOD Much of the blame can be placed on a Democratic Party that too easily abandons its most progressive factions and ideals PERIOD Can the progressive Democratic Party that brought us Franklin Delano Roosevelt be recovered I dont think so PERIOD They are too far gone PERIOD They are the beasts of H.G PERIOD Wells The Island of Dr PERIOD Moreau  originally beautiful distinct creatures now sewn together ugly and deformed PERIOD The Democratic Party should really be abandoned and allowed to die its pathetic death PERIOD The Democrats are a party for the corporations as much as the Republican Party is PERIOD They even run their party like a corporation using people as mere tools without really caring what they think PERIOD

Americans want authenticity PERIOD They want honesty PERIOD They want people who stand for something PERIOD In this Bush was better than Al Gore and John Kerry PERIOD I think Bush really does believe his policies are best for the United States PERIOD His disinclination to confront the public and seriously engage in discussion over his policies combined with Karl Roves masterful staging has really insulated the him from having to deal with the truth that his policies arent the best option PERIOD

In many peoples minds Cindy Sheehan is an authentic character PERIOD She lost here son Casey in Iraq and now she wants answers PERIOD What did Casey die for And in many ways the antiwar movement is different for her authenticity PERIOD It is not composed of disgruntled Gore voters PERIOD It is not composed of terrorists PERIOD Rather it is composed of real Americans asking questions PERIOD Why are Americans dying in Iraq Why did the president neglect the people of Louisiana and Mississippi during and after Hurricane Katrina

Im skipping homecoming to march in a parade PERIOD Hopefully well all be better off PERIOD
