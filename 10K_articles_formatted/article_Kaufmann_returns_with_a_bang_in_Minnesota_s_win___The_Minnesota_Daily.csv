COLORADO SPRINGS Colo PERIOD  Welcome back Evan Kaufmann PERIOD

The junior forward returned from a 10game absence with a bang netting two thirdperiod goals in the Minnesota mens hockey teams  win at Colorado College on Friday PERIOD

If someone told me Id score a couple goals and wed come out with a win on the first game back Id take it Kaufmann said with a grin after the game PERIOD

The grin perhaps came in lieu of how he scored those goals PERIOD His first at  into the third deflected off traffic in front of the net and gave the Gophers a  lead PERIOD

Then with  remaining in the period Kaufmann caught a pass behind the defense and shot a puck that bounced off Tigers goalie Matt Zabas helmet and shoulder before trickling into the net PERIOD

It was a great contribution by one of our few upperclassmen coach Don Lucia said PERIOD

Kaufmanns goals touched up what was otherwise a solid performance by Zaba who stopped  of  shots he faced PERIOD

His counterpart Gophers senior netminder Kellen Briggs picked up another win in his hometown of Colorado Springs and he said he knows his  saves on  shots tells a large tale for why Minnesota earned the victory PERIOD

Briggs said the team played well defensively not giving Colorado College  overall  WCHA opportunities to shoot on net often PERIOD

With the win and St PERIOD Cloud States  loss to Wisconsin Minnesota   gained two points in the race for the MacNaughton Cup PERIOD

The Gophers now sit six points ahead of the Huskies with five games remaining and if they win and St PERIOD Cloud State loses Saturday night an eightpoint lead could all but seal up a second straight regular season title for Minnesota PERIOD

And with Fridays win at Colorado Springs World Arena a place where the Tigers lost just their third conference game of the season the Gophers are looking to build off the scrappy victory PERIOD

This is definitely a big boost for the team Kaufmann said PERIOD Were getting some help from some other teams in the league right now and were going to concentrate on taking care of our job. gAME SUMMARY
