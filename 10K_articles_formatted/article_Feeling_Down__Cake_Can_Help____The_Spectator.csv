We know that  in  people are affected by a mental health condition said Marisa WayRogainis the development coordinator for NAMIs Seattle branch PERIOD Our aim is to not only raise awareness of NAMI as a resource for people in Seattle but to also just get the conversation going. participation in the event is simple PERIOD Attendees just need to show up ready to try some tasty locally made treats PERIOD When people come in well have a couple of greetersthen there will be a bunch of people with the baked goodsand well have volunteers helping people get whatever baked goods they want WayRogainis said PERIOD And were going to have an information table with information about NAMI programs as well as other mental health resources. there will also be a raffle and opportunities to buy tickets and win prizes PERIOD

I really like the attitude and importance given to mental health awareness said Seattle U student Roisin Slevin PERIOD And the promise of very cute cakes in a friendly environment. all baked goods at the Depressed Cake Shop are to be donated by local Seattle bakers who agreed to submit their creations to support NAMI PERIOD Since there is a limited supply of baked goods it is advised by Optimism Brewery owner and cofounder Gay Gilmore that all those interested arrive early PERIOD

Optimism Brewery was selected to host this event for its large space and support of local nonprofits PERIOD

Were celebrating optimists wherever we find them and those are largely nonprofits those are thegroups that are out really doing the hard work and believing in themselves and their causes Gilmore said PERIOD We really support those guys PERIOD And so we wanted to use our space and our beer to help them. the brewery will be open during the event so all those who are over  are welcome to try one of the  beers currently on tap PERIOD However this isnt your typical microbrewery PERIOD

We dont talk about beer style names because theyre kind of intimidating to some people Gilmore said PERIOD We pay our workers living wageand we are a tipfree establishment because we dont like what tipping represents. optimism works to create positiveand supportive environments for nonprofits big and small PERIOD Nonprofits can have events here for free all the time we do a lot of donatingit just so happens we have that affinity for mental illness Gilmore said PERIOD

All funds donated at the event will go to NAMI for their general operating budget PERIOD Given the organizations small size with only three staff members and one Americorp member money received goes into their programming fees and general operational fees PERIOD
