If one were to sum up the performance of Nova senior Ricky Wright last year there would perhaps be no better phrase than breakout. the 6foot7inch power forward took his game to the next level honed his skills and emerged as one of the premier lowpost powers in the Big East conference last season en route to being named a All Big East Second Team selection PERIOD Along with his fellow experienced classmates and a plethora of freshman talent Wright hopes to see that same spirit which took his game to the next level extend to the entire team PERIOD

As has become quite clear since during even the earliest signing periods Wright is not the only one anticipating the emergence of this team PERIOD The media hoopla surrounding these Wildcats is as high as its been in recent memory and while this has carried with it a level of excitement and anticipation this senior understands the other factors that come along for a team being violently thrust into the national spotlight PERIOD

We still have to play basketball games to gain respect Wright is quick to remind reporters PERIOD

As for predicting how his squad will fare in the alwayscompetitive Big East Wright isnt even going to go there PERIOD

Its too early yet to tell PERIOD

My biggest concern is having so many newcomers and trying to get everyone on the same page we finished on last year. that responsibility figures to be one of Wrights biggest challenges to date PERIOD However it is evident even early in the preseason that he is ready and able to provide the necessary leadership and guidance to complement his already proven talent on the court PERIOD

Wright enters his fourth and final season on the Main Line as the primary lowpost threat for the Cats a role which he excelled in and shared with departed center Brooks Sales last season PERIOD

With the loss of Sales to graduation Wright will not only be expected to absorb his former teammates duties in the paint but more importantly will be called upon to be the leader of a raw and talented group of young men PERIOD

His coaches have just as much confidence in this aspect of his game as they do in his interior moves PERIOD

Were very happy especially with Ricky Wright assistant coach Joe Jones said PERIOD He has really stepped up and become a vocal leader and someone that is going to do all the little things in practice that will help us win. in addition to his new role as vocal leader Wright will undoubtedly continue and improve upon his junior season during which he averaged . points to go along with . rebounds per outing PERIOD Despite earning serious recognition in the Big East in his junior year Wright has continued to work tirelessly throughout the postseason with a devotion that he knows will not go unnoticed PERIOD

I just want to continue to get better and help the freshmen out PERIOD Ive only got a year to try and teach them the things that Sales Malik Allen and Michael Bradley taught me PERIOD Im just trying to lead the team on and off the court with any troubles we may have. the mentality and mindset of the East Chicago Ind PERIOD native is the impetus for what head coach Jay Wright hopes to become the mantra of the entire team PERIOD When asked what the Villanova faithful should expect from the team this season Wright answered with a response indicative of his understanding of what his coach expects PERIOD

Youre going to see lots of defense and hard work the senior said PERIOD That is what we pride ourselves on and last year we set the foundation for that so thats going to continue to lead us and set the tone this year. villanova fans have higher hopes than ever that this formula will translate into a berth in a different postseason tournament than the Cats have participated in the past two seasons PERIOD Dealing with the pressure to make it to the Big Dance is yet another obstacle Wright must guide his team through PERIOD

The anxiety and the anticipation is the biggest thing he pointed out PERIOD My first two years people were really anxious for season but after a couple of games it kind of got old PERIOD Last year the anxiety continued to build and there were even larger crowds for every game. as far as thinking ahead to those later games and opponents however Wright understands the pitfalls that can come with counting any chickens before they hatch PERIOD

For me personally every game is important because its my last year PERIOD I take every game just as important as the one before it PERIOD Im just trying to focus and take every opponent really heavy because Im not one to underestimate anybody. with an alreadyproven and experienced Wright roving the paint area complete with his menacing scowl and fiercely swinging elbows its defender beware when challenging this Wildcat PERIOD With the mentality he brings to the team opponents can count on more of the same from his teammates PERIOD

We just try to play harder more together and with more pride than any other team we face he said PERIOD

Add to that the leadership qualities Wright brings to equip his team with the mental toughness to compete in bigtime college basketball and the Nova Nation will have ample reason to cheer this season PERIOD
