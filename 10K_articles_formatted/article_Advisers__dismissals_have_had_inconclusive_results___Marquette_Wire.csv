3211,2023-11-04,"when student publication advisers are dismissed as the Tribunes will be at the end of this academic year the journalism program and student media can face serious challenges PERIOD In some cases the newspaper journalism program and staff morale improve but in other cases dismissing an adviser under controversial circumstances damages a universitys reputation PERIOD

The adviser change at Hampton University in Hampton Va. has accompanied by a task force improved the newspaper according to Talia Buford the editor in chief of the Hampton Script PERIOD

The Script endured controversy in the fall of  when JoAnn Haysbert acting university president at the time wanted a letter she wrote printed on the front page next to an article about a school cafeteria receiving citations for health code violations PERIOD

But the letter was moved to another part of the paper Buford said PERIOD And as a result the entire issue was confiscated by the university PERIOD In response the university formed an 11member task force of which Buford was a part to create an editorial policy for the newspaper PERIOD The administration had promised not to confiscate any more issues PERIOD

Buford was happy with the results PERIOD

 she said PERIOD

But in the process two of the papers three advisers were fired because  Buford said PERIOD

 she said but added there was some skepticism in the newsroom PERIOD

Still there was little bitterness Buford said PERIOD Despite a delay to find new advisers things have gone  she said and the new advisers have been helpful PERIOD

But a positive outcome like that at Hampton University does not always occur PERIOD The journalism program at Kansas State University in Manhattan Kan PERIOD faced difficulties after the dismissal of Ron Johnson adviser to the Kansas State Collegian according to Sarah Rice editor in chief at the Collegian PERIOD

In the spring of  the Collegian failed to report on the Big  Conference on Black Student Government raising questions about the diversity coverage at the paper said Rice the Collegians thenmanaging editor PERIOD This led Todd Simon then director of Kansas States A.Q PERIOD Miller School of Journalism and Mass Communication to evaluate the newspapers content PERIOD Shortly after Johnson was reassigned to teach other classes PERIOD

According to Cheryl May director of media relations for Kansas State Johnson wasnt reassigned due to content issues with the Collegian PERIOD Instead May said the tenured journalism faculty voted  not to retain Johnson as adviser citing his poor interpersonal relationships with faculty staff and students PERIOD

But the newspaper staff was upset that its popular adviser had been fired PERIOD

 Rice said PERIOD 

Johnsons reassignment led to criticism from journalism organizations PERIOD

College Media Advisers  which works to help student media improve their operations  censured Kansas State and the Society of Professional Journalists put out an advisory against the school PERIOD

Because of the censures Rice said no adviser has yet been selected to replace Johnson and so  alumni of Kansas State have filled in while the search continues PERIOD

 Rice said PERIOD

The College Media Advisers censure which discourages faculty and professors from applying to the university will stand until the program has satisfied the organizations demands to let students produce all content without faculty review according to Kathy Lawrence president of College Media Advisers and director of student publications at the University of Texas in Austin PERIOD

The university needs to take steps to safeguard future advisers according to Johnson now an assistant professor of journalism and mass communication at Kansas State PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

Over the last few years newspaper advisers at Vincennes Universty in Vincennes Ind PERIOD and Barton County Community College in Great Bend Kan PERIOD have also been fired and others  have resigned PERIOD

Regardless of how well a newspaper fares after its adviser is fired dismissing an adviser for content problems speaks to a disturbing trend in college media according to Mark Goodman executive director of the Student Press Law Center PERIOD

 Goodman said PERIOD 

Advisers have also dealt with added pressures from universities to provide more favorable coverage of the university PERIOD

 Goodman said PERIOD

Part of the dispute between university and adviser lies in the advisers role PERIOD

 Lawrence said PERIOD
