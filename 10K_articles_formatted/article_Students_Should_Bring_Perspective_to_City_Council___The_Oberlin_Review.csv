Traditionally Oberlin students have been leaders in finding solutions to environmental problems poverty disenfranchisement gun violence and a broad range of social justice issues PERIOD Students have made major contributions as tutors and mentors in our public schools and as supporters of our community garden PERIOD Your creativity and thoughtful problemsolving regularly energize the town PERIOD

Some of you choose to register in Oberlin and if after careful study you vote in local elections that is an experience that can benefit the town and enrich your college experience PERIOD

The September  issue of the Review is a stellar example of students learning about the town and writing thoughtful summaries of issues facing the city PERIOD Parking for example remains a difficult problem of concern for both town and gown. as you embark on your busy year of study know that you are welcomed by the city of Oberlin as citizens feel that our town comes alive each September PERIOD I wish you all successful fulfilling years at Oberlin College PERIOD If you have an interest in city politics feel free to call me or any other City Council member or to drop into a City Council meeting the first and third Mondays of the month at City Hall PERIOD Once again welcome to Oberlin
