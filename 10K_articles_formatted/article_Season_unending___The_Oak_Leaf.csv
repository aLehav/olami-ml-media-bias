Zane Zinkl Variety  News EditorOctober  

Fire flashed across her vision sparking discord in the ashes of her mind PERIOD The dreams of sleep of love and sunshine of night and fear faded in that flash of flame PERIOD Her nostrils curled PERIOD The taste of acrid smoke and burning plastic tainted her tongue PERIOD Heat and soot stained her skin PERIOD Each heavy breath lingered in her lungs choking the life from her PERIOD

Her eyelids fluttered open PERIOD

The darkness of her room was all encompassing save for the deathly glow creeping beneath her doorway PERIOD Beyond the door the dull deafened sounds of crackling wood and creaking drywall were unmistakable PERIOD

She stumbled out of bed in a daze covering her face with her elbow letting loose a series of hacking coughs PERIOD She staggered barefooted towards the door her pajamas all that stood between the smoldering world and her tender flesh PERIOD She reached out in uncertainty to touch the doorknob PERIOD It was very hot but it did not hurt PERIOD

She opened the door and felt the oxygen torn from her room rushing towards the hungering inferno that had been her living room PERIOD It raged and spat and cursed her at her grinning an evil grin PERIOD The flames raced towards her from just a few yards down the hall PERIOD

She did not have time to think PERIOD Nothing could prepare someone for such a moment PERIOD Her life became cold reaction basic instinct PERIOD It happened in an instant PERIOD

She fell on her hands and knees a small respite from the smoke crawling away from the fiery death following her as fast as she could PERIOD Down the hall her brothers door was open PERIOD She crawled desperately feeling her lungs struggle with the strain PERIOD

She practically rolled through the doorway quick to kick the door shut behind her PERIOD Her brothers room was dark save for the window that looked out over the front yard PERIOD A hot ambient glow emanated through the pane of glass PERIOD Outside the world was burning PERIOD

Still on the ground she crawled towards the light PERIOD Something soft and stiff brushed her hand PERIOD She looked down and let out a mottled scream PERIOD In the dusky light she could just barely make out the form of their cat Coco stiff and dead PERIOD She never saw the cats eyes but she would always imagine they looked sad PERIOD

Her hands began to tremble and she swallowed hard PERIOD The reptilian mind the animal instinct wrenched back control its will to live indomitable PERIOD She lunged toward the window prying it open PERIOD She knocked out the screen in seconds using every fiber of her tired muscles to pull herself through the window PERIOD

She fell through the hedges outside and hit the hard ground with a thud whipping the wind out of her PERIOD When her air returned she staggered to her feet and looked solemnly on the ruins of her life PERIOD

The world she had known PERIOD

The world she was raised in PERIOD

The world she had prepared for PERIOD

That world was in flames PERIOD

Houses burned along the lane as far as the eye could see through the fiery dusk PERIOD Empty husks of cars poured out melting metal onto the asphalt PERIOD The sky was choked with smoke and it seemed like the stars would never shine again PERIOD

Even the verdant old oak in her yard once resplendent with life now towered above her like a flaming flag in an endless wind PERIOD Ashen memories of the worldthatwas floated down from the sky and kissed her cheek PERIOD She tried to wipe them away but her sweat and tears would not let them go PERIOD

She limped down the lane weaving between the ruins and rubble PERIOD The smoke clouds swirled in around her choking out the light PERIOD From out of the stark grey darkness a man in an open blue bathrobe sprinted toward her his tails fluttered and flapped raggedly behind him PERIOD

My wife Has anyone seen my wife He called out desperately in the dark to no one in particular a panicked glaze in his eyes PERIOD

Those eyes zeroed in on her and the man came up and grabbed her shaking her frantically by the shoulders PERIOD

Have you seen her Have you seen my wife Her name is Carlita Shes about this tall with dark hair PERIOD Have you seen her Have you seen my wife

All she could do was shake her head paralyzed by fear PERIOD

Part of the man broke just then PERIOD He released his hold on her PERIOD

Ive got find her Im going to find her Carlita Carlita Babe where are you

He ran off yelling into the darkness PERIOD

She never knew if the man found his wife she never saw him again PERIOD

The hot ground littered with steaming coals twisted debris and smoldering ash scorched her poor feet PERIOD She kept walking each step testing her mettle each sight aging her soul for an eternity PERIOD A part of her never stopped walking through the smoke and fire PERIOD It was an endless loop played over and over again each time she closed her eyes PERIOD

At some point through the shroud of ruin she spotted the lights of police cars and firetrucks  a beacon on the horizon PERIOD It took hundreds more eternities to get there but get there she did PERIOD It was all a daze after that PERIOD Someone swooped her up PERIOD She was in an ambulance PERIOD A mask strapped to her face PERIOD Her hand was grisly burned PERIOD

The doorknob had hurt her after all PERIOD

Her eyes rolled into the back of her head PERIOD The world went white PERIOD

The smoldering spectres haunted her every night PERIOD It had been two years PERIOD The evermoving flow of time and the immediacy of now struck her like a train PERIOD She woke up startled weeping sobbing hysterically PERIOD It was a normal thing now PERIOD

She looked deeply into her hand its gnarled scar a grim reminder of everything she had lost PERIOD She wished she was dead PERIOD She always wished she was dead now PERIOD How could anyone live like this

Her mother rushed into the room leapt over to the bed and held her daughter tightly PERIOD

Shhhhhhh PERIOD Shhhhhh its alright she soothed PERIOD Its alright PERIOD Everything is alright PERIOD Im here PERIOD Youre not alone. the girl burst out in fresh sobs of torment PERIOD

Her mother squeezed her tighter PERIOD

Its alright baby PERIOD Its alright PERIOD You dont have to be afraid PERIOD I wont let anything happen to you PERIOD Its over now. the girl fell darkly silent suddenly her eyes empty sockets PERIOD

Her mother could never understand PERIOD

The sickly grey visage of that smokey cloud its heart pulsing with hellfire would always hang over her PERIOD

It would always be there PERIOD

Her constant companion PERIOD

A deathly shadow PERIOD

She would never escape it PERIOD
