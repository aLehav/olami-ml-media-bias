With spring break fast approaching for El Camino College students many are left to wonder whether traveling during an ongoing pandemic is a safe idea PERIOD

As it currently stands there are a total of . million cases of COVID19 in the United States alone according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PERIOD This figure alone is enough to discourage many El Camino students from enjoying spring break on vacation PERIOD

While indoor activities and events may be on hold for the time being many outdoor establishments have adjusted for students on break PERIOD

Drivethrough movie theaters are a way to watch movies by following the COVID19 safety guidelines PERIOD Locations such as Arena Cinelounge DriveIn have provided the classic moviewatching experience in place of a traditional indoor theater with films such as Godzilla vs PERIOD Kong debuting on March  PERIOD

Students should look into reserving their tickets in advance with prices reaching from  per car PERIOD As it currently stands there are drivein theaters on both  Sunset Blvd and  N Las Palmas Ave PERIOD

Due to the ongoing pandemic locations have set safety guidelines to ensure that guests have a safe viewing PERIOD Examples of such policies include temperature checks social distancing facecovering mandates and rules about staying in your vehicle at all times except restroom visits PERIOD

Aviation fanatics longing for an enjoyable spring break should look no further than the Western Museum of Flight PERIOD Located on Airport Drive in Torrance PERIOD

The driving force behind a visit should be the opportunity to attend an educational institution dedicated to informing visitors of their history PERIOD COVID19 has caused health and safety guidelines to be followed to ensure guest safety PERIOD With social distancing face coverings and temperature checks being the forefront of such policies PERIOD The admission fee is  PERIOD

Scenic spring breakers that seek outdoor adventures in place of indoor activities may turn to Madrona Marsh Preserve and Nature Center PERIOD Attending visitors are encouraged to enjoy selfguided trips PERIOD Stationed on Plaza del Amo Torrance PERIOD Visitors wont want to forget their binoculars for some bird spotting PERIOD

As with any other location social distancing measures are required and face coverings for employees to ensure visitor safety PERIOD As a bonus visitors are welcomed to enjoy Madrona Marsh free of charge however docent tours are available for preschool through college students for  cents per student PERIOD

El Camino students seeking hairraising experiences should turn to JJ Helicopters for breathtaking Los Angeles views PERIOD Students may want to look into alternative perspectives with a city as diverse and enriching as Los Angeles PERIOD Located on Airport Drive in Torrance PERIOD

Due to limited spacing in helicopter rides safety measures include face coverings temperature checks along with limited capacities on board PERIOD Traditional 1hour tour prices reach as much as  per person PERIOD

While following the safety guidelines carefully one can visit the piers PERIOD However proper planning may be needed to ensure a safe trip PERIOD Santa Monica Pier has usually charged guests  per vehicle PERIOD However walkups are always free PERIOD

Social distancing is a requirement along with face masks PERIOD However Santa Monica has a strict curfew on itself PERIOD With the pier officially closed by  p.m. all guests will be informed to exit PERIOD

Spring break during a pandemic does look like it may be full of complications PERIOD But it has shown many folks how to adapt  showing that with a bit of preparation anyone can have a safe and fun spring break while following the safety guidelines PERIOD
