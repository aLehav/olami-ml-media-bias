ention and reversal of ailments such as diabetes and heart disease PERIOD

Scientific studies have shown the more we eat a wholefood plantbased diet the healthier we are Pollard said PERIOD Everything presented will be meatfree and wholefoodbased. though the meal will be meatfree Pollard said the movie isnt about vegan ideology or banning animal proteins from diets but rather focuses on the health benefits of organic plantoriented eating PERIOD
