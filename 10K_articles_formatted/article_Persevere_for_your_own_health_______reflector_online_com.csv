Generally clear skies PERIOD Low 42F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The weather has been teasing us lately with a few sunny breaks from the dreariness of winter PERIOD

Even though were probably due for a few more cold snaps the transitional warm snaps always manage to lure out one particular faction of society the joggers PERIOD

But just as fast as they appear most joggers disappear back into their airconditioned houses or cars for the rest of the summer PERIOD

This is a plea to anyone who is beginning a workout plan this spring PERIOD Stick with it PERIOD This could be your breakthrough year if you give it a chance PERIOD

The benefits of regular exercise have been adequately documented PERIOD Theres no point in explaining why people should work out PERIOD

What people really need to understand is how long they should expect to exercise before they see any results PERIOD

Everybodys body works a little differently so it may take one person longer to adapt to a workout than another PERIOD And its usually going to take longer to notice results than whatever target period you have scheduled PERIOD

Trust me it does eventually get easier PERIOD But that wont come until after some hard work PERIOD The trick is to mentally toughen yourself enough to persevere even when it seems like youre working out for nothing PERIOD

Some people seem to think that after a week or so of exercising they should be up to speed with experienced runners PERIOD This is of course not the case PERIOD

Every winter scores of people tell themselves that theyre going to get out more once the weather shapes up PERIOD Then every spring those people are unleashed on the world for a furious week or two of jogging or whatever workout they prefer before their limits are tested PERIOD

This is the time of year when regular joggers start to notice a lot of new faces suddenly appearing on the street PERIOD Its even more obvious than the New Years resolution surge which is understandably hampered by the cold weather PERIOD But after a couple weeks the number of new runners begins to thin out PERIOD Then inevitably warm weather gives way to hot and as the old adage says only the strong survive PERIOD

But there is no reason why we cannot all be strong enough to exercise on a regular basis PERIOD Certainly finding the time in a busy schedule can be an obstacle but nobody said that you have to work out every day to get in shape PERIOD Exercising two or three times a week will have an impact after your body gets used to being pushed PERIOD

And then if you do stick with your exercise regimen the most wonderful things start happening PERIOD You notice the changes PERIOD

Suddenly you can run a little farther without losing your breath PERIOD You can lift a little more weight without exhausting your muscles PERIOD Or you can play ball longer without getting worn out PERIOD

Then your ego really kicks in PERIOD Once you realize that all the hard work you put in is finally paying off it only makes you want more PERIOD

When you notice a little less fat in the mirror it makes you want to drop whatever youre doing and immediately go run some more PERIOD

When you notice slight changes in your muscle tone it makes you want to hit the weights even harder PERIOD Its amazing what a little progress can do for your mindset PERIOD

This is one of the few times when vanity can actually be a healthy trait PERIOD

But if working out just doesnt seem to agree with your body and you cant fathom the idea of dieting then try to be content with yourself PERIOD Stress is a killer and stress over weight or appearance can be particularly intense PERIOD

So if you dont lead what the experts would call a  lifestyle then please try to be satisfied with the way you are PERIOD Because unhealthy living coupled with stress is going to be much worse for your body than unhealthy living alone PERIOD

For those that do intend to make an effort to exercise this spring now that your cold weather excuse has gone away be prepared for an uphill climb PERIOD

Nobody said getting in shape was easy PERIOD And there are no pills or miracle machines to do it for you PERIOD Youre just going to have to sweat it out PERIOD

Remember that when it feels like you cant go any further and your body is screaming at you to quit thats the crucial moment when you have to decide to keep going PERIOD

Those moments and they may come on a daily basis are going to set the tone for how successful your workouts will be PERIOD

Your body isnt used to that much physical discomfort and your brain instinctually tells you that if you would just sit still the pain will go away PERIOD So its up to you to override your thoughts ignore the pain and keep moving PERIOD

Of course remember to drink lots of water all day and be sure to stretch out before you exercise PERIOD And bear in mind its important to push yourself while youre exercising but common sense should be employed PERIOD

The last thing we need is somebody working out to the point of hurting their body rather than helping PERIOD

So to those people who are trying to get in shape this spring and summer I salute you PERIOD

Even if you dont make it very far before you throw in the towel theres a lot to be said for trying PERIOD Youre definitely on the right track PERIOD
