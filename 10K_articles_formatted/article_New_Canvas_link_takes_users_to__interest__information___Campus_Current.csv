Canvas will display a new link on every students dashboard this semester that will lead to videos and information about possible majors PERIOD

According to Assistant Dean of Liberal Arts Dr PERIOD Marjorie Rawhouser the new link dubbed campus communities will support AACCs new fields of interest program PERIOD

Rawhouser explained fields of interest as a new way the college is organizing majors this semester PERIOD

She said although the college will not add or remove any majors it will organize them into fields of interest based on common skills to help undecided students narrow down what they want to study PERIOD

Each major that links to the campus communities feature on Canvas will have its own module which will include upcoming events and contact information for faculty liaisons PERIOD The module also will contain a brief video previewing the classes students would take within a chosen field of interest and which types of jobs are available in that field PERIOD

Rawhouser said all students can use the new Canvas link to explore information about any field of interest whether they have chosen a specific one or are undecided PERIOD

This sounds extremely useful Elijah Richard a firstyear undecided student said PERIOD I will

definitely use it because Im undecided PERIOD Being able to pick a field Im interested in using the new link would save me time and effort. students who are not undecided will also have a link to the fields of interest PERIOD

Even if you have a major you still might want to know more about another field Rawhouser said PERIOD

Kevin Thompson a firstyear environmental science student said he might consider changing his major in the future PERIOD This will help new students figure out what they want to do but it can also help if you are curious and looking to switch. campus Current
