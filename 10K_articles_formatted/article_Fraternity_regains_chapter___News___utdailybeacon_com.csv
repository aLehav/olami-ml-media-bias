One of The University of Tennessees oldest fraternities is back on campus PERIOD

Kappa Alpha which ended its previous stint with UT on a sour note has reloaded with new members and is poised to make its return a successful one PERIOD

Founded in  Kappa Alphas Pi chapter was one of the universitys longeststanding fraternities when its charter was revoked by the orders national office PERIOD An article in the Feb PERIOD   issue of the Daily Beacon said Kappa Alpha was removed from campus due to numerous incidents the most prominent of which involved the chapter organizing cock fights hiring strippers and recruiting homeless men to box PERIOD

After a few years hiatus the national office began the process of recolonization in  PERIOD The fraternity became an official provisional chapter last November PERIOD

The reemergence of Kappa Alpha will be beneficial for UTs Greek system as a whole Fraternity Affairs Advisor Andrew Shafer said PERIOD

Any time someone gets kicked off its an opportunity for them to come back as a stronger group he said PERIOD Bringing them back is a step in the right direction for all of UTs chapters. the strength of the new group can be contributed to the process by which members were selected PERIOD The Kappa Alpha National Office conducted a series of interviews with a pool of roughly  prospective members PERIOD The pool was then trimmed down to  men who would best represent what the fraternity stands for PERIOD

I cant think of a higher compliment than the national office handpicking them to represent KA Mike Baisley said one of the chapters alumni advisors PERIOD

Its a very impressive group of individuals he added PERIOD

The group of individuals ranges from freshmen to seniors PERIOD The chapters members said the opportunity to revitalize a fraternity added to the appeal of joining Kappa Alpha PERIOD

Youre given the unique opportunity to become a charter member Adam Rowan chapter president said PERIOD

Rowan also has a Kappa Alpha legacy in the family PERIOD

His father uncle and cousin were all members of the fraternity during their college years PERIOD His family history of involvement inspired him to join the renewed brotherhood PERIOD

It really excited me to be able to build on that legacy of family tradition he said PERIOD

According to Rowan becoming a charter member is not without its rough spots PERIOD

Kappa Alpha is currently a provisional chapter PERIOD In order to become an official charter the group of  founding members must maintain the national Kappa Alpha principles while establishing a foundation for the individual chapter for a period of  days PERIOD

Theres a lot of trials and tribulations that go into the rechartering process and were finding that out the hard way Rowan said PERIOD Its more difficult for us because we have no precedent to build off of. despite the difficulties Rowan is confident the rechartering process will result in a more tightly knit fraternity PERIOD

Kappa Alpha is expected to be granted an official charter by the next Fall semester PERIOD In the meantime the fraternity will be holding an event for its charity the Muscular Dystrophy Association this spring PERIOD Plans to build a house are also in the works PERIOD Rush for all fraternities begins Jan PERIOD  PERIOD
