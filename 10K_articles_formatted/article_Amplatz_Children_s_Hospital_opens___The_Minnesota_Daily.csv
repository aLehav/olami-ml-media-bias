by  Kyle PotterPublished  May  

Rochelle and Kerry Ingram have lost count of how many times their son Devin has gone under the knife PERIOD
We stopped counting after  Rochelle Ingram said PERIOD
Since Devin was born more than  years ago the family has shuttled back and forth between North Branch Minn. and Minneapolis to tend to his kidney problems including a transplant in  PERIOD
But Saturday was different PERIOD
Devin and almost  other children settled into their spacious new rooms after being moved from the old University of Minnesota childrens hospital on the East Bank to the new  million Amplatz Childrens Hospital in Riverside which officially opened Saturday PERIOD
Marked by its metallic peacockcolored exterior the 227000squarefoot facility is home to  patient rooms an intensive care unit and a childrens emergency department that works around the clock PERIOD Natural light floods through each rooms bay window and illuminates the walls and floors painted in cheery pastels PERIOD
It replaces the outofdate childrens hospital on the East Bank which will be repurposed to care for adults PERIOD Medical School Dean Aaron Friedman said hospital staff had to work around the old space PERIOD
Its going to be a tremendous improvement over what were able to provide today Friedman said of the new building PERIOD The setting will work with us to improve and enhance the care. as Devin Ingram sat in his new room watching a movie on an enormous LCD TV his parents listed the benefits of the facility that theyre sure to see more of in the coming years a refrigerator and an extra pullout bed in each room more cupboard space and a washer and dryer on the premises PERIOD
Every room has just one patient which gives the Ingrams privacy and some peace of mind PERIOD
It seemed like every time we roomed with someone he would catch something PERIOD Now we dont have to worry about that Rochelle Ingram said PERIOD
Dr PERIOD Joseph Neglia chairman of the Universitys pediatrics department has been involved with the design and planning of the building for the past several years PERIOD
Behind the shiny exterior and stateoftheart technology the hospital is focused on creating a positive healing environment for the children and their families Neglia said PERIOD
A small touchscreen monitor hangs at each bedside that allows kids to pick movies or video games change the rooms lighting and if need be call a nurse PERIOD
The hospitals  private rooms are identical and were designed in conjunction with a team of children and their parents PERIOD Each room is  percent larger than the nations average room PERIOD
It really is not a standard childrens hospital Neglia said PERIOD It will allow them to feel a little more normal in a period of recovery. the hospital is named for Dr PERIOD Kurt Amplatz who spent  years researching medicine at the University PERIOD His daughter Caroline Amplatz donated  million toward the hospitals construction in  in her fathers honor PERIOD
Caroline Amplatz Friedman and Neglia all looked on at the hospitals ribbon cutting ceremony Tuesday PERIOD
As he watched How to Train Your Dragon Devin Ingram and his family noted their muchimproved view PERIOD The straight shot to Minneapolis downtown skyline is far better than the view of a brick wall at the old hospital PERIOD
Or a porta potty Devin Ingram added PERIOD
Its more comfortable too  more inviting Rochelle Ingram said PERIOD It makes it not as bad to stay in the hospital. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
