Oklahoma States Cameron McGriff shoots a threeas the Cowboys take on Tulsa in the Reynolds Center on Dec PERIOD  PERIOD

As a freshman Cameron McGriff saw his older teammates react to adversity on the court PERIOD

He witnessed how Leyton Hammonds and Phil Forte then seniors on the Oklahoma State mens basketball team bounced back after difficult games PERIOD He watched Jeffrey Carroll and Mitchell Solomon maintain optimism PERIOD

During the  season the Cowboys sputtered to a  start in Big  play PERIOD

They handled it like pros McGriff said PERIOD They were just resilient kept positive energy every day. oSU is facing earlyseason struggles again but McGriff finds himself in a different role PERIOD McGriff a junior forward is a veteran captain for the Cowboys PERIOD He like Hammonds and Forte throughout his freshman season is someone who can set the tone for his young teammates PERIOD

A grueling nonconference stretch resulted in four straight losses for McGriff and the Cowboys this season PERIOD OSU holds a  record and has two matchups left before its first Big  game PERIOD

The Cowboys will look to break the losing streak when they face Central Arkansas at noon Friday in GallagherIba Arena PERIOD

Im kind of familiar with what were going through right now and I think Im trying to handle it the best way possible keep positive energy amongst these other guys who may be discouraged McGriff said PERIOD

During McGriffs freshman year the Cowboys recovered from the shaky start to conference play and ended with a  record going  in the Big  PERIOD McGriff said the upbeat attitudes of teammates including Hammonds and Forte influenced the outcome of the season which ended with an NCAA Tournament appearance PERIOD

This year McGriff is adapting to more than a leadership role for younger Cowboys PERIOD Opposing defenders have directed their attention toward him striving to limit his scoring efficiency PERIOD After McGriff had a careerhigh  points in OSUs victory against LSU on Nov PERIOD  his offensive productivity waned PERIOD He scored in single digits in three of the Cowboys past four games including his twopoint outing against Nebraska on Sunday PERIOD

Mike Boynton OSUs coach recognized how McGriff has transitioned from quietly posting highscoring performances to becoming someone opponents prepare to stop because they know he can score PERIOD

Its a pretty natural thing Boynton said PERIOD Its kind of hard to quantify how hard that adjustment is. oKStates Mike Boynton on Cameron McGriff trying to adjust to facing defenses that focus on him...Hes gotta take pressure off himself offensively. pic.twitter.comjMhjcpKA4a

Boynton said he could tell McGriffs mindset wasnt where it should be when he saw him uncharacteristically miss free throws PERIOD

Inconsistency from the stripe has affected multiple Cowboys in recent games PERIOD In the loss to Nebraska OSU shot 8for15 from the freethrow line and made only half of its free throws in the second period PERIOD

We get a lot of reps up and at this point you just have to focus and be ready to make the shot McGriff said PERIOD

Boynton said McGriff needs to ease the offensive pressure he puts on himself PERIOD When Boynton had oneonone film sessions with each player McGriffs meeting reinforced the idea that he can impact a matchup with skills other than scoring PERIOD

I can crash the glass try to protect the rim take charges McGriff said PERIOD

Winter break allows the Cowboys to focus solely on basketball and McGriff said its a time for them to regroup PERIOD As McGriff tries to lead a group of mostly inexperienced but undiscouraged teammates he knows where he is focusing his efforts PERIOD

Just trying to find a rhythm throughout the game McGriff said PERIOD Trying to help my team in any way possible. sports.edocolly.com
