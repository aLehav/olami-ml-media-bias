1826,2007-05-09,"i absolutely love this school PERIOD If I had to make the decision again I would still come here PERIOD 
But even though Santa Clara has been a great place to spend four years there is no shortage of ridiculous crap that goes on at this campus PERIOD 
Since this is my last article and I wont have a chance to write about any of these issues individually here is my list in no particular order of  things that go on at this school that annoy me PERIOD
 Santa Claras antifun policy
We arent getting a football team back the Greek system is staying off campus and the alcohol policy is getting stricter without making anyone safer PERIOD Is it just me or is University President Paul Locatelli. s.J. on a mission to ruin everyones fun
 Dangerous drinking rules 
Speaking of the alcohol policy it is ridiculous that students still get punished if someone calls the EMTs for them PERIOD 
The administration stated a new alcohol policy was needed because transports were up but all the new policy does is decrease the incentive for students to get medical help for a friend who might be in serious danger PERIOD 
 Discussion of campus issues lacking
 The MCC stifles discourse through attrition PERIOD The combination of fear and apathy on campus keeps a lot of voices silent and has created a general disdain for the MCC among the silent majority of students PERIOD This is of course counterproductive to combating racism at Santa Clara which is a very real problem PERIOD
 RLCs not as advertised
The RLCs are pretty much a failure PERIOD I may be biased because I spent two years in Communitas which basically is the RLC without a theme but the RLCs seem to really only do two things PERIOD 
Unity RLC just isolates all the minority students from the rest of the campus which doesnt help the racism problem PERIOD And Loyola and da Vinci just isolate members of two of the most docile RLCs in the newest nicest dorms which doesnt seem like a coincidence PERIOD 
 What happened to Western Civ
Removing the Western Civilization requirement from the new core curriculum is ludicrous PERIOD What kind of liberal arts school doesnt require Western Civ The claim that students dont need Western Civ classes because they were exposed to it in high school is about as ridiculous as assuming that students dont need to take calculus in college because they have already taken geometry PERIOD
 Administrators getting involved off campus
The administration needs to  quit wasting time interfering in benign offcampus incidents PERIOD 
My housemate recently had to go to a judicial hearing because our house received three 48s in one year and Santa Clara police  issued a fine PERIOD Isnt the fine punishment enough 
Whats even more ridiculous Some friends of mine broke a plank in their fence and their neighbors complained to the school PERIOD Now the student tenants have to attend a meeting with an administrator PERIOD
 Blatant disregard for student safety off campus
And while these administrators are wasting time dealing with fences really scary stuff is going on off campus PERIOD 
There have been two drug busts at the apartment complex next to my house in the past year PERIOD There was a police standoff at an apartment on Bellomy Street two years ago only to be followed by a murder a year later PERIOD 
And through it all the administration has remained silent PERIOD 
 Less than satisfying food service
Bon Appetit They have a monopoly so they provide mediocre food and terrible service and rip us off in the process PERIOD 
And as if that wasnt enough Bon Appetit has the nerve to insult our intelligence by insisting that they offer  like almost  for a burger and fries that are about on par with McDonalds quality PERIOD
 Bogus book prices
The Bookstore This one is a nobrainer PERIOD They also have a monopoly and they also rip us off PERIOD 
The only alternative Get a decent price online but wait until week four to get your books PERIOD
 Inaccessibility of birth control
Santa Claras birth control policy is stuck in the Stone Age PERIOD The policy doesnt really stop anyone from obtaining contraception but the fact that the health center cant provide it because the Pope says so is embarrassing PERIOD  
Chris Cavagnaro is a senior political science major PERIOD
