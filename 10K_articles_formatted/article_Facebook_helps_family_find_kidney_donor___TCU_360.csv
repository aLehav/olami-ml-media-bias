Facebook is not just for sharing photos and videos or connecting with friends PERIOD For senior music performance major Danielle Bishop the social media site provided her family a unique way to find her father a kidney donor PERIOD

Last year senior music performance major Danielle Bishops father Dr PERIOD Michael Bishop contracted atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome aHUS PERIOD aHUS is a disease so rare that Dr PERIOD Bishop was originally misdiagnosed according to Danielles mother Patty Bishop PERIOD

It was misdiagnosed because they didnt know what was wrong with him Patty said PERIOD There are only about  to  people in the United States who have it. then came even more devastating news PERIOD

Nicole Bishop Danielles older sister said the doctors informed the family that the donor couldnt be in their fathers immediate or extended family because those members may also have the disease in their blood PERIOD

I started panicking a little bit Nicole said PERIOD At that time the disease had progressed a lot PERIOD We were pretty desperate. the doctors placed Dr PERIOD Bishop on a wait list for a kidney match but the family couldnt afford to waste time PERIOD Danielle said the doctors told her family the average wait lasted four to five years but the family could not wait that long PERIOD

A frantic hunt began for a kidney match PERIOD The Bishops began spreading the word to friends but with no luck PERIOD

Nicole said she decided it was time to expand to a wider population PERIOD

I realized I needed to be open about it and do all I can to find somebody she said PERIOD I knew about marketing and social media and I thought might as well make a Facebook page. hundreds of users began not only liking the page but also sending messages to the family offering to donate PERIOD While some were friends of family others were complete strangers PERIOD

People around the U.S PERIOD and people worldwide were trying to be donors Danielle said PERIOD

After waiting about six months a match was finally found PERIOD The match didnt come from another state or country PERIOD The donor conveniently enough was located right in the Bishop familys hometown of Sugarland Texas PERIOD

Jennifer Stoval has known Dr PERIOD Bishop for  years but only through his office PERIOD He happens to be her sons pediatrician PERIOD

We were following Dr PERIOD Bishop when he got sick Stoval said PERIOD I happened to be in the office one day and saw they had set up a Facebook page. nicole said when her family heard news of the kidney match they thought it was too good to be true since it had to be exact PERIOD But once they learned the donor resided near Sugarland and actually knew Dr PERIOD Bishop personally their spirits lifted PERIOD

That was the icing on the cake Nicole said PERIOD We all shed a lot of tears that night PERIOD God is good. prior to viewing the Facebook page the only thing Stoval knew about the Bishops was that they had three daughters PERIOD

The page let me see what the girls were doing and it gave me a lot of information about the family Stoval said PERIOD It really helped me make my decision and start the testing because I saw that this family had come together PERIOD They were trying to reach out. stovall said she never waivered during her testing and imagined herself in Pattys position PERIOD

I kept thinking that if it had been my husband I would want someone to do that Stovall said PERIOD Its just interesting the way things work out. dr PERIOD Bishop underwent his kidney transfer on July  PERIOD

Its incredible Danielle said PERIOD We are really thrilled PERIOD My dads alive so were happy. nicole said her father is back to his old self again PERIOD

Hes doing very well she said PERIOD Hes back to working fulltime PERIOD He looks a lot better and has a lot more energy PERIOD

Patty said both Stovall and her husband Michael are now part of the family PERIOD

We really enjoy having them around Patty said PERIOD Theyre near and dear to us. on every other Friday for the rest of his life Dr PERIOD Bishop will be infused via IV with Soliris a drug manufactured by a pharmaceutical company in Connecticut PERIOD She said the infusion prevents kidney rejection and usually takes  minutes to complete PERIOD

Both Michael and Patty Bishop have now put their efforts into creating and increasing awareness for aHUS PERIOD She said because the disease is so rare it is often put on the backburner and forgotten PERIOD

A couple weeks ago the couple traveled to San Diego Calif PERIOD where they promoted their Facebook page and advocated aHUS research and treatment to  people in attendance PERIOD

Facebook can do some really great things Patty said PERIOD It can be bad but it can do wonderful things and it has for us PERIOD It brought in awareness about kidney donation. readers can find the Bishop familys public page at www.facebook.comdrbishopkidney PERIOD",Facebook helps family find kidney donor | TCU 360,Texas Christian University
