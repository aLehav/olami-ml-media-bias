I decided to visit my father in Akron during the first weekend of February to catch up with him PERIOD I hadnt seen him since December and I was looking forward to recounting my stories of Egypt a part of the Middle East and North African region which I had visited since our last meeting PERIOD As a Palestinian he had his own tales to tell about the region PERIOD

Our conversation shifted to Palestine specifically as it often does and we recounted the hardships of the Palestinian people through the past eight decades PERIOD We discussed the tragedies and the difficulties then the conversation shifted slightly PERIOD But Syria he said PERIOD Whats happened there is unspeakable. we shared a silent moment in recognition and continued PERIOD The next day I woke to news of an earthquake in southeastern Trkiye that had reached parts of Syria PERIOD

At the time the earthquake had a death toll in the hundreds across the region PERIOD A day later thousands PERIOD By Feb PERIOD  over  had perished including nearly  in Syria PERIOD The .8magnitude earthquake has devastated communities and families turning buildings to rubble and leaving millions of people without homes PERIOD

Let me make it clear By focusing on Syria in this article I am in no way downplaying the severity of the recent earthquake among Turkish people PERIOD I write here on Syria specifically and I was inspired to do so because of the recent disaster but I am not writing per se about the disaster PERIOD

Syrias numerous weaknesses make it a nation unprepared for a disaster like the Kahramanmara earthquake PERIOD This is not the first crisis the country has faced and it is unlikely to be the last PERIOD According to the Fragile States Index Syria is the thirdleast stable country on Earth the result of a variety of factors including a fractured government and a feeble economy PERIOD

Its easy to sympathize with the Syrian people PERIOD Their participation in the Arab Spring uprisings was characterized by a hope especially among youth that the Arab World would finally see an end to tyrannical autocratic regimes and see a new dawn of peace PERIOD A democratic society was taking shape PERIOD Yet what came of it was a civil war that after nearly  years has shown no signs of stopping PERIOD According to the United Nations Human Rights Office  civilians were killed in the first  years of fighting PERIOD It is easy to sympathize but few take action PERIOD

Modern Western powers broadly speaking are not interested in the wellbeing of Middle Eastern countries and their people PERIOD They participate in sending relief packages but if they truly cared the United States would not have invaded Iraq on false claims of weapons of mass destruction nor would it impose sanctions that make delivering aid to Syria unnecessarily difficult nor send military aid to Israel that is used among other things for aerial attacks on Syrian soil PERIOD Frankly what has happened in Syria is a gross injustice PERIOD The people who call the country home do not deserve to live in constant fear of death or displacement as unwilling expatriates or as refugees huddled into precariously assembled camps PERIOD They as much as the people of Ukraine the United States or any other nation on Earth deserve peace stability and fair treatment PERIOD Because they lack such fair treatment though they have been left naked in the wake of a tragedy that has devastated their home PERIOD

Though the Syrian government is untrustworthy when it comes to distributing relief funds there are nongovernmental organizations  such as the White Helmets in Syria and the International Rescue Committee more broadly  that can make a difference PERIOD I encourage people to donate to organizations like these but I dont think that a donation is enough PERIOD Syria is constantly the center of global attention as a failed state. because of this there seems to be a common sentiment that its salvation is a lost cause and that its people are destined to suffer for the rest of time PERIOD To sit idly by and grow complacent to the suffering of others begets yet more suffering and injustice PERIOD This sentiment of indifference must be addressed if the world is to become a more habitable place PERIOD

Humanitarian activist organizations are important factors in achieving this goal but development really happens on the ground PERIOD Tides need to change paradigms need to shift and individuals must take accountability as advocates for change PERIOD Do not forget that we at Oberlin live in the most powerful country on Earth a country that despite all its flaws allows for free expression and democratic elections PERIOD Use your power and your platform to make a difference PERIOD Remember Syria like you remember Ukraine PERIOD Remember its people whose tears and blood are shed side by side PERIOD Remember the hundreds of thousands of innocent people who have died in a war they had no part in PERIOD Remember the children who have no place to go when their homes collapse in on themselves PERIOD Remember  speak up assist and advocate PERIOD
