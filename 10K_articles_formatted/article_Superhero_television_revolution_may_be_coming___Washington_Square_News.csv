1842,2023-11-04,"comic book characters have become essential fixtures of modern entertainment PERIOD Movies have benefited the most from this superhero craze with The Avengers making more than  million its opening weekend but TV is starting to capitalize on the trend PERIOD From The Walking Dead to the upcoming Arrow which premieres this Wednesday comic books are beginning to realize their smallscreen potential PERIOD

Translating comics to TV has always been a problem PERIOD For starters many bigname actors are simply not interested in TV PERIOD This leaves lesserknown actors who often have just as much talent but considerably less draw power with the pressure of carrying iconic characters to the small screen PERIOD Thus many comic book TV shows falter after just a few episodes PERIOD However there are two comics that have the potential to escape this trap and make great TV adaptations PERIOD

First though it may be dark Marvel Comics The Punisher would make for terrific television PERIOD Frank Castle alter ego of The Punisher has all the vengeful spirit of Batman without any of the moral scruples PERIOD Castle is a vigilante whose fight against the criminals and mobs of New York City is nothing short of a bloody oneman war PERIOD He murders kidnaps extorts and tortures his victims PERIOD

Castle is the perfect antihero for cable television and might be a nice fit for HBO PERIOD He has a large enough following to attract an audience on his own and viewers would be able to sympathize with his motivation his murdered family PERIOD The Punishers story is often portrayed like a crime show an angle that could be taken in plenty of different directions  from a basic revenge arc to an exploration of the dark psychological contortions of his mind PERIOD Castle is a very complex character and having multiple episodes to fully explore his multifaceted personality would make for very emotionally compelling television PERIOD

Another old comicbased show that deserves a reboot is Wonder Woman. the show was not a huge hit in the 1970s but with all the hype surrounding Marvels Black Widow this would be a perfect time for DC to take Wonder Woman out of the vault PERIOD She has a massive following and a comic book history dating back to  PERIOD Wonder Woman exudes confidence strength and moral conviction  a great role model for young girls everywhere PERIOD She is independent loving fierce and sympathetic while still maintaining her authenticity PERIOD She has the potential to become an inspirational empowerment figure for the modern era PERIOD

Many significant comic book characters are too emotionally complex for a movie to fully grapple with in only two hours PERIOD Some characters are a better fit for the small screen not because they cant support their own movie but because their stories are more intriguing when told over time PERIOD
