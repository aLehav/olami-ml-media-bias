Living in coastal Louisiana is no easy task PERIOD Hurricanes have drowned and destroyed houses in areas like Venice and Empire creating a desire for hurricaneproof housing PERIOD

A multidisciplinary study from the Universitys Coastal Sustainability Studio looks to find out whether thats possible with earth block or adobe style houses PERIOD

Associate professor of civil and environmental engineering Michele Barbato said the researchers plan to use soil from around Louisiana as construction material to make the ecological footprint as small as possible PERIOD

For example he said cooling and heating in adobe houses has the potential to be  percent more energy efficient than standard houses PERIOD

Assistant professor of architecture Robert Holton said the studys main challenge is to see if its feasible and sustainable to make adobe suitable for Louisiana PERIOD

In Louisiana theres a hot wet climate Holton said earth blocks have traditionally been used in arid climates like the west Southwest U.S..

Ph.D student Mirsardar Esmaeili said the earth blocks can be fortified with concrete to combat the humidity and improve wind and flood resistance PERIOD Adding lots of concrete isnt optimal though as it makes the building costs more expensive PERIOD

The less concrete needed the better Esmaeili said PERIOD

The study has three focal points for the houses aesthetic structural integrity and economic feasibility PERIOD The focal points correspond to the three departments working together on the study architecture engineering and agribusiness PERIOD

Working with other disciplines is nothing new to Holton PERIOD He said architects are always working with other specialties by the nature of their job PERIOD

Architects often work with people in engineering acoustics environmental systems and lighting Holton said PERIOD More people offer different perspectives on the work. barbato agreed saying big issues like global warming and coastal sustainability require many perspectives PERIOD

No single approach can tackle these issues Barbato said PERIOD

Multidisciplinary studies bring more than just different perspectives Barbato said PERIOD Funding agencies are putting more money into multidepartmental studies PERIOD

Despite the benefits of multidisciplinary research Barbato said it brings some unique challenges PERIOD

For example he said the word design means completely different things to engineers versus architects PERIOD Design for engineers means safety coefficients stresses and dimensions of the structure PERIOD For an architect its about how the space is organized for aesthetic purposes in addition to structural concerns PERIOD

Barbato said the study is still in its early stages with data collection as the primary aim PERIOD Esmaeili and fellow Ph.D student Nitin Kumar have mapped out and tested various soils around Baton Rouge to find the right balance of sand silt and clay PERIOD

If there is too much expandable clay cracks propagate in the blocks Esmaeili said PERIOD

So far theyve found soil in the sweet spot of sand silt and clay around riverbanks PERIOD
