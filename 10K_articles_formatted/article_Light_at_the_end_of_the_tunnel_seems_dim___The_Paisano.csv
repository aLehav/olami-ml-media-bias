Celebrating National Cat Day

A Swifties analysis of  Taylors Version

Theres been a general air of doom for the impending  year PERIOD The Mayans decided to play the grandest trick on the world and pretend like they knew when it was going to end PERIOD This has left my ear filled with conversation from amateur doomsday theorists about all the coincidences occurring around the world that prove the world is coming to an end PERIOD

The debt in the U.S has topped an unprecedented level and now is equal to the entire U.S economy PERIOD In other words the debt that the U.S has incurred is now equal to everything were producing in this country PERIOD

Long term projections show that the likelihood that the national debt will grow at a faster rate than the U.S economy and the economy would have to grow at rate of  percent in order to keep pace PERIOD

President Obamas  budget shows the debt moving past  trillion in  years PERIOD Last summers deficit reduction deal could make that number  trillion PERIOD Among advanced economies only Greece Iceland Ireland Italy Japan and Portugal have debt larger than their economies PERIOD These countries all share the distinction of being at the center of the European debt crisis PERIOD

If that doesnt cheer you up consider the coming election PERIOD Many Republicans find themselves dissatisfied by their candidates PERIOD On top of that President Obama has never looked more unimpressive in the eyes of many voters PERIOD The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Sunday shows that  percent of the nations voters strongly approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing as president PERIOD Voters strongly disapprove giving Obama a Presidential Approval Index rating of . although declining unemployment is still higher than it has ever been going into an election year since World War II PERIOD At . percent there is still much to be done by the next president in terms of job creation PERIOD

Were also fatter than weve ever been PERIOD According the CDC about onethird of U.S PERIOD adults . percent are obese PERIOD Approximately  percent or . million of children and adolescents aged  years are obese PERIOD The number of overweight Americans not obese is . percent PERIOD According to a new study released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development threefourths of Americans will be obese or overweight by  PERIOD

The whole world has gone to hell in a hand basket and this is coming at a time when many of us will soon be entering the workforce within the next few years PERIOD Our generation is inheriting a great big pile of manure and we will be forced to solve many of these problems PERIOD

However over the break I had the chance to talk to a friend who was doing some work for children in Sudan PERIOD His church raised money to feed  children in Sudan with a bag of rice and beans daily PERIOD When he visited he found many of the children lived naked digging through garbage to survive daily PERIOD Im reminded of the story because many of the problems we have seem so small in the grander scheme of things PERIOD

Martin Luther King Day has passed with many observing the day by doing things that have little value PERIOD Dr PERIOD King said All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence. if the world comes to an end then I hope that our time on earth would have been spent trying to make it better rather than just complaining about it PERIOD
