What is our responsibility to socially awkward people in classes Should we let them speak their awkward opinions openly even if it takes away from the class on the whole



Nicholas



Lincoln NE





Nicholas Ive long feared the dreaded token weird kid PERIOD



One of them exists in every class Ive ever taken in college PERIOD Sometimes there are two which is completely ridiculous because they play off of each other PERIOD If its three watch yourself because youre in for a bloodbath PERIOD Its typically never more than two but exceptions can be made PERIOD



The gods that do the scheduling for the University of NebraskaLincoln have worked out a formula to make sure that the weird kids are pretty equally distributed between classes so were all evenly unhappy PERIOD If youre asking yourself what a weird kid looks like so you can make sure who they are the litmus test is pretty easy Do they wear the same clothing every time you see them Do they speak at a volume well above the other students in class Do they have an accent like a 1950s movie character Do they try to relate all of the material youre covering back to  or their pets



If you answered  to any of these questions you have a weird kid on your hands PERIOD Unlike pretentious kids burnouts dickheads dweebs assholes douchebags and thatonegirlwhothinksshessmartbutweallknowthetruthsweetheart weird kids are not selfaware PERIOD In fact they think theyre normal just like you and me PERIOD But they couldnt be more wrong PERIOD



The normal unassuming college student adds productive input to class discussion instead of turning it into a Samuel Beckettesque catastrophe where everyone puts their heads down trying to harness their happy place praying for the person to just shut up PERIOD



To answer your question Nicholas I believe that we have no responsibility to weird kids PERIOD Yes you can call them socially awkward and pretend they dont know any better but lets call a spade a spade PERIOD Just a note here the idiom  predates our racially sensitive fingerpointing  the ancient Greek playwright Menander used the expression first  and has nothing to do with a once offensive term I simply use it now to focus my hatred on weird kids. theyre weird



When I was home over the summer I was walking around the Princeton University campus enjoying a nice summer day PERIOD As I walked I noticed a girl with whom I went to high school PERIOD Like a kind polite person I said hello and asked her how shed been PERIOD



No longer do I care to be categorized as kind or polite PERIOD I had forgotten how goddamn weird and loud and terrible this girl was PERIOD As soon as I greeted her she inundated me with her life story since wed graduated PERIOD No one knows how long this onesided conversation lasted but it felt like days PERIOD



Oh youre going to Princeton University now That must be exciting PERIOD Oh you just spent a year in England studying at Oxford Thats great PERIOD Oh you have some really contrived opinions about Restoration literature that youre somehow rationalizing by comparing it to your twenty-first century life Thats cute PERIOD

No PERIOD



 I screamed to heavens once she was out of earshot PERIOD



Whether or not we have some responsibility Nicholas you can decide for yourself PERIOD But Im going to use the final few inches of this column to declare war on weird kids everywhere PERIOD Nevermore will you ruin perfectly good classes for me with your foolish ramblings PERIOD



Heres to you Really Christian Girl who told me that God hated me for the amount of graphic fornication in my creative writing assignments PERIOD



Heres to you ImAllowedToTalkLikeThisBecauseImFromNorthOmaha Guy PERIOD You have terrible taste in film your comments were longwinded and incorrect and your final project was made on Windows Movie Maker PERIOD



And finally heres to you PacMan Kid roaming the halls of Neihardt waiting to spring out from a dark corner and say something really loud and stupid and disruptive and misguided and selfgratifying and horrible and Ill just put my head down because otherwise Ill say something Id regret later PERIOD



If I was more of a man Id stand up to these foes and best them with my wit and superior everything PERIOD But alas I am not PERIOD
