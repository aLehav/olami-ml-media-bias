Updated November     pm



UC is home to many students and a lot of them are what is considered nontraditional meaning they are not between the ages of  and  have children or fulltime jobs. more and more students are faced with parenthood at early ages forcing them to compromise time and education for the welfare of a child. amanda Friedman is a student parent who has been attending UC parttime for eight years working toward a degree in Communications and a certificate in Womens Studies PERIOD She already has an associates degree in general studies from Clermont College PERIOD 

She had her son Isaac Dec PERIOD   at Good Samaritan Hospital after finishing a final exam Dec PERIOD  PERIOD 

Isaac suffers from Down syndrome a congenital disorder caused by having an extra twenty-first chromosome resulting in short stature and mild mental retardation according to Websters dictionary. i work full time so I have only been able to go to school part time but it is really important to me to get a degree I want to be able to protect my sons rights said Friedman. she and her husband did not find out Isaac had Down syndrome until he was born. so far we are really lucky she said Isaac is really healthy has no heart problems he is developing a little slower maybe three of four months behind compared to typical kids. friedman has to find a way to balance her schoolwork family and job which is what most student parents find hardest the balancing according to Perez. having a child makes me really pay attention in school PERIOD I want to be able to learn as much as I can about people and law so I can try to protect my son to the best of my ability when I need to it definitely gives you a new real sense of purpose. friedman attended class up until the last days of her pregnancy. my professors were very accommodating I just told them up front that I was pregnant and what I would need from them she said. the hardest thing is when the baby is kicking you and youre in classes listening to the professor lecture and you have to just sit there and pretend this little baby isnt jabbing you. friedman said being pregnant didnt really impede her school work as she had an easy pregnancy. her mother is able to watch Isaac at night while she and husband work as head servers for two Cincinnati restaurants PERIOD 

During the day her husband is able to watch their son while she attends class. both Friedman and Perez said one of the most challenging aspects for student mothers is the increasing tuition. in general it would great if the university could stop raising tuition help out with books PERIOD I know sometimes nontraditional students can get grants but when you are budgeting so strictly anyway and next quarter the tuition is up again it can be a big deterrent from continuing with education Friedman said PERIOD 

Rachelle Lawson who has an associates degree in Education from UC and is currently in her third year of communication study is also a student mother. she had her now 8yearold son while she was completing her first degree PERIOD 

I stayed in school all throughout my pregnancy I was  years old at the time Lawson said PERIOD Then when I gave birth I had to establish a whole new lifestyle for us and get settled into parenting. she decided to go back to school and obtain a bachelors degree after being a case worker for Hamilton County Job and Family Services for four years. while the case management workforce developed my experiences I knew I needed to go back to school to really be successful. lawson also wanted to spend time with her son. she said she knew she needed to be home more and that school would have to be put aside until her son was old enough to be in school during the day. i had to work and pay out of my pocket for him to go to daycare but I didnt have another choice she said PERIOD 

After school he goes to the community center near his school until Lawson is either finished with class or her parttime job at a collections office. definitely the most difficult thing about having a child is learning to juggle all the different aspects of life and maintain healthy social relationships said Lawson PERIOD I have to really focus to not neglect anything. lawson initially came back to UC to pursue school counseling starting with education then psychology. she did a lot of personal reflection before realizing she wanted to obtain a degree in communication PERIOD 

Lawson hoped it would help her achieve her goal of becoming a motivational speaker for young women PERIOD 

UC and its professors have been accommodating to her needs as a nontraditional student so far according to Lawson PERIOD 

As UCs population continues to diversify the university strives to encourage all students to feel comfortable and accepted while getting an education PERIOD
