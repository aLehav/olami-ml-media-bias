Its not uncommon for Quinn and Jack Hughes to skate together PERIOD

The two brothers  Quinn a sophomore defenseman on the Michigan hockey team and Jack a forward for the U.S PERIOD National Team Development Program NTDP U18 team  have played together for nearly their entire lives PERIOD

But Friday will be the first time the two take the ice to play against each other PERIOD

Last week the Wolverines  got off to a slow start against Vermont as they fell  in the first game of the season PERIOD After beating Waterloo in an exhibition matchup the following Sunday Fridays game is a chance for Michigan to finish shaking off the earlyseason cobwebs PERIOD

Exhibition games are usually thought of as an easy win for the home team maybe a chance to give some playing time to younger players and help the team settle into the season PERIOD

This game doesnt have the makings of aclassic exhibition game PERIOD

The NTDP features Jack Hughes who is already considered a candidate for the No PERIOD  overall pick in the  NHL draft PERIOD If that isnt reason enough last weekend the NTDP defeated last years national runnerup Notre Dame  in South Bend PERIOD

I think its a good sign in a way for our players Michigan coach Mel Pearson said PERIOD Its a good reminder to our players that the NTDP is a good team and that they can beat anybody PERIOD Were gonna have to play and thats why you schedule this game. and the matchup has the added bonus of allowing the Hughes brothers to face off against each other in a real fiveonfive setting PERIOD

I think its special any time you get an opportunity to play against your brother Pearson said PERIOD I had the opportunity to do that in college so it was pretty cool PERIOD Its interesting because I think you compete harder PERIOD

I dont know how they feel about it but I always thought it was pretty neat playing against my brother  and competitive PERIOD Probably competed harder against him than anybody else and Im sure these guys have a little bit of compete in them too. quinn said hed rather play with his brother than against him but its clear that if he must play against his brother he wants to be the victorious one PERIOD

I think were not really worried about trash talking or anything like that PERIOD I think he just wants to win and I want to win Quinn said PERIOD He wants to bring his A game and I want to bring my A game thats all it is. and with Jack playing forward and Quinn playing defense theres a reasonable chance the two brothers A games will come into direct contact PERIOD

Quinns skill as a defenseman led him be picked seventh overall in the  NHL draft and Jack has the pedigree of a top prospect too PERIOD Its a battle of strength vs PERIOD strength only complicated by a family relationship PERIOD

This likely wont be the last time the Hughes brothers face each other PERIOD But its the first and itll be memorable regardless of which brother wins PERIOD
