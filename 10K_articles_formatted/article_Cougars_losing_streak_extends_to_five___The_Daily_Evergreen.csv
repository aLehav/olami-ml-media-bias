RYAN ROOT Evergreen reporterJanuary  

WSU mens basketball extended their losing streak to five games when the Cougars   fell to the Colorado Buffaloes   after a complete breakdown in the second half PERIOD

The Cougars led Colorado by  points at one point in the first half but blew the lead in the second half after Colorado senior guard McKinley Wright IV took over offensively PERIOD

Head coach Kyle Smith said Wright IV played like a senior and was certainly the differencemaker in this one PERIOD

Wright IV went down early in the first half after a loose ball collision between him and freshman center Efe Abogidi PERIOD Wright IVtook a long time to get up and off the court PERIOD He was helped off by the Colorado trainers and he eventually returned at the start of the second half PERIOD

Senior guard Isaac Bonton turned his game around somewhat after scoring just four points against Utah PERIOD He finished with  points on  shooting PERIOD He played all but three minutes in this game as he and sophomore guard Noah Williams tried to find the answer on offense together PERIOD Williams finished with  points of his own which included four threepointers PERIOD

Sophomore guard Ryan Rapp made his longawaited return to the court against Colorado after missing the past month due to COVID19 protocol PERIOD He said it feels good to be back on the court and help his team out in any way he can PERIOD

I was quarantined in the house for a long time havent seen all the guys Rapp said PERIOD So its been really good to be back out on the floor with everyone and just being around the team again. wSUs first four minutes of the game had a lot of energy and tenacity from the Cougar offense PERIOD Bonton scored a quick five points which already surpassed his point total in WSUs previous game against Utah PERIOD

Smith said he was really proud of the team starting the game with a lot of energy on offense PERIOD Playing a team like Colorado was certainly going to be a challenge to keep the momentum going he added PERIOD

I knew it was going to be tricky to stay in that zone and we werent able to Smith said PERIOD

Although Bontons doubledigit scoring streak ended last game against Utah he scored  points after just  minutes into the first half PERIOD He was the only Cougar with doubledigit points until Williams joined him when he scored his tenth point with a little over five minutes left in the half PERIOD

Colorado powered through the remainder of the first half PERIOD The closest Colorado cut the lead to was four but the Buffaloes trailed for the rest of the half PERIOD

At the half WSU led Colorado  PERIOD Williams and Bonton combined for  points  points apiece to give WSU the edge at halftime PERIOD

Also at halftime the Cougars shot . percent from three and  percent from the freethrow line PERIOD Both of these stats are both first halfseason highs for WSU PERIOD

The momentum of the game shifted once Wright IV checked back into the game at the start of the second half for Colorado PERIOD Wright IVwas certainly not  percent as he was consistently stretching out his lowerbody injury PERIOD

At this point Wright IVcompletely took over in the second half PERIOD

Wright IV who had only an assist in the first half scored  points dished out four assists and pulled in seven rebounds in the second half alone PERIOD He managed to play every minute of the second half PERIOD

With a little over  minutes to go in the game the Buffaloes took their first lead since the opening minute of the game as they led  over WSU PERIOD

Slowly but surely Colorado pulled away with the doubledigit win PERIOD Freshman center Dishon Jackson became the third player on the WSU team to score doubledigit points scoring  points PERIOD

Over  percent of the Cougars points came from the starting lineup as the bench only scored five points PERIOD

Smith said its important to have depth on offense and hopefully Rapp among others can find the answer off the bench soon PERIOD

The Cougars next game will be against the Buffaloes once again this time on the road at the CU Events Center in Boulder Colorado PERIOD Tipoff will be at  p.m PERIOD PST and will air on ESPNU PERIOD
