Following world leaders meeting in Katowice Poland for COP24 and the G20 summit in Argentina it seems international momentum toward climate action is growing despite President Trump being the only leader at G20 not to sign onto an agreement reaffirming commitment to the Paris Climate Accord PERIOD 
In fact Trumps administration plans to hold a sideshow at COP24 to promote clean coal detracting from the global action on climate change PERIOD The urgency of climate action was made clear by the recent IPCC Report on Global Warming of . c and the even more recent National Climate Assessment PERIOD 
The responsibility for U.S PERIOD action on climate change lies on leaders in America with the power to make change PERIOD University endowments often invest heavily in the fossil fuel industry sotoplevel administrators in higher education have the potential to be these leaders PERIOD 
Fossil fuel divestment targets polluters who have ravaged the environment and accelerated climate change PERIOD Divestment has already shifted . trillion away from fossil fuel companies PERIOD 
The premise is simple institutions with investments in fossil fuels remove their holdings from such companies and reinvest them in climate solutions like renewable energy or sustainable agriculture PERIOD Notable divestment commitments include the country of Ireland New York City New York and London England as well as many systems of higher education across the globe PERIOD 
In the U.S. some public university systems that have divested from fossil fuels include the University of Massachusetts University of California and University of Maryland systems PERIOD 
In the state of North Carolina Warren Wilson and Brevard colleges both divested citing the moral obligation for systems of higher education to discontinue profiting off of climate destruction PERIOD 
While these are great steps they do not address the combined UNC System endowment which totaled a collective . billion as of June  PERIOD This sum includes the endowments of  institutions in the UNC System PERIOD 
Students from UNC Chapel Hill NC State University UNC Asheville UNC Wilmington Western Carolina University and Appalachian State University united to form the NC Reinvest Coalition recognizing both the moral imperative behind fossil fuel divestment as well as the promising financial returns that have been demonstrated by sustainable investing PERIOD We are committed to ensuring the UNC Systems investments are aligned with its values and we cannot condone our institutions environmental destruction and contributions to the climate crisis PERIOD 
Administrators in the UNC System suggest that divesting would negatively impact returns on investment but that is not the case PERIOD In fact at NCSU a small portion of the endowment is already invested exclusively in socially and environmentally SRI responsible funds PERIOD
Since its inception in  this  million portion of the endowment has consistently outperformed its traditionally invested counterpart according to Bloomberg and publicly available information on both funds PERIOD If one acknowledges that addressing climate change means ending use of fossil fuels as we do today then fossil fuels pose a long term investment risk PERIOD Therefore they are financially unsuited for university portfolios which aim to preserve long term returns PERIOD 
Furthermore divestment is inconsistent with the missions of our institutions PERIOD Institutions that express a commitment to incorporate economic social and environmental sustainability into our institutional practices shouldnt invest in companies doing just the opposite by contributing millions of dollars to dirty fuel companies PERIOD
The decision to divest is not just one that has to be embraced by universities within the UNC System PERIOD Jon King the president of the UNC Management Company which invests the UNC System endowments has expressed firm resistance to fossil fuel divestment and sustainable investing PERIOD 
The lack of transparency and commitment to client satisfaction from UNC Management Company is shocking PERIOD UNC System schools do not receive any information about where our money is invested apart from what is publicly available online PERIOD This is almost unheard of especially considering that the UNC System schools are clients of the UNC Management Company PERIOD 
NC Reinvest Coalition and UNC System students are demanding that universities remove their endowed holdings from UNC Management company if UNCMC refuses to become a signatory to the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment UNPRI and grant a fossil fuel divestment request PERIOD Beyond fossil fuel divestment we ask that UNC Management Company 
incorporate SRI investment approaches into their management approach PERIOD If not a new management company ought to be considered PERIOD
