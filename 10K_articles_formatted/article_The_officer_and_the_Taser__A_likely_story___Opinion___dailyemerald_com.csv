7673,1970-01-01,"in a dangerous world full of potential evildoers hidden under every blanket police officers have a right to employ Tasers when suddenly tangled in a mess of fabric PERIOD

One courageous Eugene police officer was unafraid to protect his city from a clothcovered hand attached to a incompliant student who refused to explain why he was sleeping on his bedroom floor hours after procuring a new apartment PERIOD When the officer tried to pry the covers from this presumed vagrant some force of nature tried to interfere with his peacekeeping efforts PERIOD

Officer Judd Warden  the  Officer of the Year for his efforts to preserve order by firing some  volts into the back of local neerdowell Ian Van Ornum  wrote in a report that he did not know whether he had tripped on the students legs the blankets my own feet or slipped PERIOD I dont know if the student swept my feet with his legs PERIOD I know I was pulling the students blanket back to see his hands and the next thing I know I am on the ground on my right side. any reasonable person would tase the bejesus out of a blanketwielding floor sleeper who can magically topple an officer of the law PERIOD

Some may say the student could not answer questions because he did not speak English PERIOD A Chinese exchange student he is enrolled in basic English courses at the University PERIOD

Maybe the University should learn to teach these students common phrases such as Police  drop the comforter or Im falling Im gonna tase you. warden offers this gripping account of his struggle after he hit the sparse bedroom floor I was now tangled in the blanket and the students legs PERIOD While I was on the ground he turned toward me PERIOD I thought he was coming at me to potentially hurt me and told him to get back PERIOD He continued toward me ignoring my commands to now get back PERIOD I stood quickly and deployed my Taser striking the student on the right side of his chest PERIOD He was still sitting on the ground PERIOD He rolled to his stomach and was taken into custody. this student just wouldnt quit PERIOD First he rented an apartment different from the one he was supposed to occupy and was so unremarkable in doing so that management forgot him and called police when he was found inside PERIOD Then he dared to occupy the space without a bed  a sure sign of skullduggery in the Craigslist era PERIOD Then he ignored a policemans call to remove his hand from under the covers PERIOD

He was lying on the floor and would not show me his hands when ordered to PERIOD I continued to yell at him to show me his hands and got negative results Warden wrote PERIOD He just stared at me and did not say anything to me PERIOD He sat up but still had his right hand hidden under the blanket PERIOD I continued to tell him to show me his hand PERIOD I attempted to push him over with my foot PERIOD He just leaned against the wall while now sitting and still had his hand hidden under the blanket. who did this guy think he was Casually leaning against a wall with his hand under a blanket groggily staring at a man who entered his bedroom to yell and brandish a peace wand PERIOD One must assume he did not know where he was PERIOD He surely would have thought twice about his actions if he realized how such intransigence is handled in the city of Eugene PERIOD
