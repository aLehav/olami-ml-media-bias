Cool temperatures and a ground still laced with trickles of snow are not ideal for the beginning of the outdoor track season PERIOD But the Michigan womens track and field team has to make a transition into a new season PERIOD Last week the Wolverines started practicing outdoors again for their first meet PERIOD Today they will be in Tallahassee for the Florida Relays PERIOD

Were more prepared than the first meet of the indoor season Michigan coach James Henry said PERIOD Our goal is to take pressure off individuals and give them the chance to run in relays given the good weather outdoors. during this twoday meet the team will gauge its fitness against other teams PERIOD Coming off a break from Big Tens the Wolverines should be able to ease back into competition after this nonscoring meet PERIOD

Its been four weeks since theyve competed assistant coach Mike McGuire said PERIOD Were excited about getting started  were making a little bit of a transition from a small 200meter indoor track to going outside. unique to outdoor season some athletes are able to compete in field events which were not present during the indoor season PERIOD Discus javelin and hammer are three events which the Wolverines will put contenders in for the first time PERIOD

In these events well be placing a mixture of veterans and new people Henry said PERIOD Its their chance to start the season PERIOD Although its the third season overall its the first season for them. relays make up the majority of events at the meet PERIOD The 4100meter relay is an added bonus to the fastpaced stimulus of track and field events PERIOD

Its a perfect meet to start out the season McGuire said PERIOD Well have the opportunity to get some relays in PERIOD Most of our top and middledistance runners will compete in relays. for the outdoor season a more complete itinerary of relays are run including the 4100meter relay up through the 41500meter relay PERIOD Due to space limitations in the indoor season only certain relays are run including the 4200meter 4400meter and 4800meter events PERIOD

Introducing longer relays could present a challenge to distance runners PERIOD With events such as the 41500meter relay stamina is key PERIOD For this type of event careful preparation is required and proper conditioning shows up in these extensive runs PERIOD

Also since the time span is longer runners have to be smart and pace themselves throughout the race PERIOD

Two Wolverines will represent Michigan for the distance portion of this meet PERIOD

Katie Jazwinski and Lisa Ouellet will just be running relays McGuire said PERIOD Weve been down there the last three years previously and have always done well. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
