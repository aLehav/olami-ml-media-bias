A phrase that Ive been hearing repeatedly throughout the duration of the pandemic is when we go back to normal. things will be better plans will be made and loved ones will be seen when we go back to normal. a pandemic is not an event that leaves a culture untouched and frankly if we come to the other side of this and nothing has changed due to it we should strive for better PERIOD

This moment has highlighted necessary change PERIOD

As somebody who both is and has loved ones who are at heightened risk of complications due to COVID19 the responses to the pandemic on many levels have failed me PERIOD

I am not even part of other groups that have been touched much more deeply by this trauma like Black Americans and the homeless population PERIOD

We are in a moment of redefinition PERIOD I do not know what the future will look like but I do know that it is incredibly unlikely it will look like the past PERIOD

So when people reassuringly tell me that any myriad of things will be better when we go back to normal its dismissive of this entire experience PERIOD

Its dismissive of the sacrifices Ive made the nights Ive spent awake and the precautions Ive been taking for the past eight months PERIOD

I dont know what our new normal will look like or when it will come but I know I hold it to a higher standard than this PERIOD

The COVID19 pandemic has been a huge blow to the convention community mainly for the artists who sell to the many patrons that attend PERIOD

Conventions were the highlight for artists PERIOD For some to make a living PERIOD

It wasnt just the fanfare of the many fandoms cosplays or events that were condensed into those short three days PERIOD

It was seeing all the people and the smiles brought on as they bought our goods that took hours and a lot of money to produce PERIOD

With virtual cons what is left for the artists

Paying and prepping for the amount of stock enough to sell to hundreds of people for it all to stay in boxes and to slowly sell online PERIOD

Conventions gave notice fan support and gave us confidence in our work PERIOD

As one of those artists what do I do now

Being stuck at home has resulted in me watching a lot of TV PERIOD Almost every new show I seemed to have watched PERIOD

The Bachelorette in particular has sparked a lot of conversation lately PERIOD This season is truly unlike any other PERIOD

Not only did the filming process happen during a pandemic but the bachelorette this season was very unexpected PERIOD

Usually the bachelorette is a popular contestant from the last season of The Bachelor PERIOD

Not only was Clare not from the last season she was also  PERIOD Most of the contestants were noticeably much younger than her PERIOD

Clare being a very intense person brought a deep emotional turn to almost every conversation PERIOD

Her need for a deep connection got in the way of her making meaningful connections with the contestants PERIOD

Not everyone can dive straight into a deep conversation without knowing someone for a while PERIOD

Her fixation on the contestant Dale also became an obsession PERIOD

I understand the feeling of falling for someone very deeply and wanting to focus on only them PERIOD

However The Bachelorette is all about dating multiple men at once not just one PERIOD

With the election around the corner which old white guy is going to win

The one who doesnt know what position he is running for or Chester Cheetos grandpa getting his orange dusty fingers all over the oval office

One candidate who calls himself a visionary has one point for his candidacy that I love and believe we all need to get behind from here on out PERIOD

We need to value our relationships more than money and politics PERIOD

We are all in this together and need each other PERIOD

Go out and vote for whoever you believe will run this country the best and at the end of the day if you and your neighbor voted opposite of each other you still better bring them that damn cup of sugar over for their cookies and tell them to have a great night because that is what neighbors do PERIOD

With COVID19 keeping us all indoors theres no better time than now to truly evolve into the greatest chef in the world Chef Gordon Ramsay PERIOD

With all the time you have inside its a great time to binge some Master Chef or stalk Gordon Ramsays TikTok and dream of being as cool as him PERIOD

Sure you can learn a recipe or two but what I really mean is learning how to speak like a true chef PERIOD

Next time you sit down for a meal maybe spew out a quote from Gordon Ramsay himself like For what we are about to eat may the Lord make us truly not vomit. eventually maybe even you can become as beautifully versed as Chef Ramsay PERIOD

Just dont go blaming me if you start speaking in a British accent PERIOD

I cant tell which is worse the fact that West is on the ballot or the fact that some voters dont know hes only on the ballot in  states PERIOD

Those  do not include Washington PERIOD

There are some interesting and passionate third party candidates on the ballot who have well thoughtout stances on issues but Kanye West isnt one of them PERIOD

Also many third party candidates are actual politicians PERIOD

Please take your vote seriously and vote for a party that isnt titled the Birthday Party PERIOD

The Electoral College is the formal body which elects the President and Vice President of the United States PERIOD

When voters go to the polls in a Presidential election they are actually voting for the electors to cast their ballots for that ticket in the Electoral College PERIOD

According to the Federal Election Commission in the  election Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by . and while that may not seem like a lot that . represents more than . million votes PERIOD

However President Donald Trump won the election because of the electoral college obtaining  more electoral college votes than Clinton PERIOD

If you care about democracy you should care that this happened PERIOD

The people of the United States did not vote Donald Trump into office PERIOD

Rather a group of people took the countrys fate into their own hands and decided to vote against the nominee the people chose PERIOD

The peoples voice should be the voice that matters the most PERIOD The nominee the people vote for should be the nominee to become president PERIOD

To accurately represent a true democracy the electoral college should be abolished and the fate of the country should be voted on through the popular vote PERIOD

The flipside of COVID19 outbreaks is COVID19 breakouts PERIOD

Ive probably aged a good five years during the pandemic because of maskne or mask acne PERIOD

Its not cute PERIOD Ive combed through the recesses of rSkincareAddiction and tried many different strategies to manage it PERIOD

Right now my strategy is being thankful the mask covers up the problem it caused PERIOD Send help PERIOD

Whether or not you submit your ballot by  p.m PERIOD today and I encourage you to do so please remember to get involved the rest of the year PERIOD

Regardless of how this election plays out there is still more work to be done PERIOD

Stay informed on what your elected officials are PERIOD

Know who your representatives in congress are PERIOD Know who the mayor of your town is PERIOD

While it seems like your voice wont make a difference it does PERIOD

If theres something in your community or in your town that you dont like speak out about it PERIOD

And if your elected officials dont do anything about it then vote them out or run for their position to change it PERIOD

While it is important to vote in a presidential election please remember to make your voice heard more than once every four years PERIOD

Growing up Ive never had any consoles where I could really play with anybody else PERIOD

I found joy in watching people on YouTube playing games instead PERIOD

During COVID19 I was able to get a PC that could run the games Ive always wanted to play myself PERIOD

Ive been able to play Ark Survival Evolved Among us and Dead by Daylight PERIOD

Playing these games has kept me going throughout the pandemic PERIOD

Phasmophobia by Kinetic Games has the most recent one PERIOD

It was released on Sept PERIOD  and has already hit number five on Steams list of top games PERIOD

The game itself is described as a four person coop psychological horror game but can also be played with a solo team PERIOD

Ive never been one for the horror genre and probably wouldnt have even considered playing it if I hadnt watched others play it PERIOD

The goal in the game is to discover what type of ghost based on the three pieces of evidence the ghost reveals without getting killed by the ghost as well as record evidence of the paranormal activity PERIOD

The game uses directional chat for players to have a complete immersive experience PERIOD

Phasmophobia is so fun itll make you wet your pants PERIOD

Every single day is a gift and should be treated as such PERIOD Its a gift because tomorrows not promised PERIOD

All we can control is right now and right now its very vital that we vote PERIOD

Ill be the first to admit that Im ashamed I have never voted before PERIOD I blame myself for this selfish act PERIOD

Always believing that everything will be handled PERIOD Clearly with how divided our country is that assumption was wrong PERIOD

You should never leave anything in the hands of someone else PERIOD Especially someone who doesnt care about you PERIOD

President Trump during the second debate didnt condemn white supremacy and told the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by. get up and vote PERIOD Your voice matters PERIOD Right now is going to determine the future not just for you but for your kids and their kids as well PERIOD
