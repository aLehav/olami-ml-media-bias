In  no new addition had more hype for the Michigan baseball team than graduate third baseman Matt Frey PERIOD Coming off a stellar senior season when he was arguably the best hitter on Davidson Frey only improved through preseason training PERIOD

He became the frontrunner to start at third base for the Wolverines after hitting the best on the team by a landslide according to Michigan coach Erik Bakich PERIOD However the potential of Freys fifth year was quickly cut short PERIOD

In the last official fall practice he tore his ACL and didnt play for the entire  season PERIOD For most players a seasonlong injury means a waste of a year PERIOD

Not for Frey PERIOD

Hes a guy that traveled with us every single away series because it was very clear from the beginning how valuable he was as a teammate Bakich said PERIOD   Its created a very seamless transition for him this year for a guy who hasnt played in a full year. after that season on the bench Frey was joined by his Davidson teammate graduate second baseman Alex FedjeJohnson PERIOD Both were attracted to Michigan because of its culture recent success and academics PERIOD

I think academics played a huge role Bakich said PERIOD   They both are excellent students and had very specific goals in terms of wanting to get into the Ross School and wanting to pursue business later in life PERIOD And they both happen to have a year of eligibility remaining and wanted to play at the highest level possible while still earning a great education. fedjeJohnson entered his fifth year with sky high expectations PERIOD Coming off of a dominant senior year with Davidson in which he slashed ... he was expected to be a plugandplay piece in the lineup PERIOD

FedjeJohnsons hitting has been far below his Davidson peak to start the year PERIOD He has been by far the least efficient hitter among batters with at least  plate appearances PERIOD Slashing ... hes had more strikeouts than hits or walks PERIOD

The Wolverines are traditionally much better at integrating transfers PERIOD Just last year Griffin Mazor Christian Molfetta and Benjamin Sems all vastly improved from their preAnn Arbor forms and were each selected in the  MLB draft PERIOD

The season is very young but FedjeJohnson will need to be more patient at the plate to fend off bench players from seizing his spot in the lineup PERIOD

He plays our best defensive second base and we need to get there defensively as well Bakich said PERIOD Were at the point now were  games into it where its not about time PERIOD  I would expect that well see some simplification to his swing into his approach this week just to allow him to be a little bit more consistent and productive for us in the lineup. on the flip side of the coin Frey has been elite PERIOD

After a slow start with only four hits through the first six games he broke through with a fourhit threeRBI game against FIU on March  and never looked back PERIOD

He leads the starting batters with  walks while maintaining the lowest total strikeouts at nine and slashing ... PERIOD Michigan has depended on him as one of the most consistent hitters on the team PERIOD

Hes one of our hes one of our most patient hitters Bakich said PERIOD Hes got some of our best plate discipline and he very rarely chases PERIOD When he swings the bat hes got a propensity to make hard contact PERIOD  Hes just an older mature hitter. moving to a new place can be difficult especially when you feel like you need to swing hard and prove yourself PERIOD Frey and FedjeJohnson have shown through their results that patience is one of the most important parts of baseball PERIOD

If FedjeJohnson stops forcing it at the plate success like Freys will follow PERIOD
