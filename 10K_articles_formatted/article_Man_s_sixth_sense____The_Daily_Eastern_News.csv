Love is a great and beautiful thing PERIOD But lets face it  hooking up is so much more fun PERIOD



Eastern has definitely treated me better than high school did PERIOD There are a few things I have learned about the opposite sex during my four years at a state school which happens to have a larger female population than male PERIOD While personal lessons hit home more the things my old man has told me about women lately have been equally insightful PERIOD He and my mother separated during my sophomore year and needless to say his outlook on the opposite sex was affected PERIOD

The purpose of this column isnt to give any sex advice though because Im far from the one to be giving tips on seducing women or turning yourself into the big man on campus PERIOD

Rather Id like to talk about what I believe is mans sixth sense PERIOD Its all about the vibe PERIOD Im sure most of you know what Im talking about PERIOD As Led Zeppelin said When your evening starts to glow is usually when you start to pick it up PERIOD She wants it and you know it PERIOD Now you have to decide what are you going to do about it PERIOD

In my opinion women dont need to waste their sixth sense on something as caveman as young lust PERIOD In case some of you guys havent noticed and as my old man would say women ultimately decide if things are going to progress past the flirting phase PERIOD

When youre hot youre hot PERIOD It seems like youll go through stretches at a time where nothings happening and youre just going through the motions PERIOD Then suddenly typically out of nowhere theres the vibe again PERIOD Maybe it coming from someone youve known for a while who is also been in slump and other times its from someone you just met and you really dont know that well PERIOD

The key is the outofnowhere element PERIOD Typically forcing the issue leads to disaster PERIOD I dont know how many times one of my friends or myself has built up a night in our minds as the night when you finally make your move PERIOD But those nights where you just go out to have good time are the nights where something extracurricular happens with someone who is pleasing to the eye or captivates you with his or her knowledge of whatever topic you might be on that night PERIOD

Lately my old man has stressed the fact that they want it just as much as you do PERIOD Now that I think about it hes actually been telling me that since high school but maybe I finally believe him PERIOD Nonspecific pronouns work fine in this paragraph because in my opinion it doesnt matter what side of the equation youre working on theyre both equal PERIOD

Bringing us to one of the most intriguing sociological questions of human nature PERIOD Why are females typically punished by their peers for their sexual prowess while males are rewarded or held in high regard by theirs Slut and pimp kind of mean the same thing in the college lexicon but one is practically a slur while the other is a college form of nobility PERIOD

Oh yeah why isnt it called the walk of shame when a guy walks home on a Saturday morning at  a.m PERIOD wearing the same clothes as the night before with a big grin on his face
