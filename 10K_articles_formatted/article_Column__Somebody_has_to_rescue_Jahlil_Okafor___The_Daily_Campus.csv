All of Philadelphia Trusts the Process but the Process has left some prospects behind PERIOD

After over a year of trade rumors Jahlil Okafors time with the 76ers is finally coming to an end PERIOD Last week the Sixers announced they would not pick up the fourthyear option on Okafors contract making the big man an unrestricted free agent at the end of the year PERIOD

Theres no guarantee Okafor even reaches that point PERIOD Philadelphia is still dangling his name out there looking for a willing trade partner PERIOD And teams should take the bait because the former No. overall pick still has something to offer a team PERIOD

Okafor has been glued to the Sixers bench as other prospects have flown past him on the depth chart PERIOD Some of this is due to the fact that Okafor has struggled with injuries but he has always had to share a frontcourt with other young big men with unrefined games PERIOD

Last year Philadelphia had four lottery players sharing the same frontcourt PERIOD The 76ers made it clear that Joel Embiid and Dario Saric were their chosen two stopping just short of leaving Nerlens Noel and Okafor in a cardboard box on the side of the highway PERIOD

Its hard for a prospect to develop when hes fighting for scraps PERIOD

Embiid and Saric suit the 76ers but its not Okafors fault he was drafted too high for the current state of the NBA PERIOD

Okafor likes to get the ball with his back to the basket and despises the thought of leaving the paint PERIOD Just  of his  shot attempts last year came outside of the key PERIOD In a league that values pace and space above all its a wonder that Okafor was drafted as high as he was PERIOD

Even if he is a man out of time a big man with a scoring touch will always have a place in the NBA PERIOD

Okafor is two years removed from his rookie season where he averaged . point per game and  rebounds PERIOD The knock on him has always been his defense but other big men like Karl Anthony Towns are below average defensively and its rarely ever brought up PERIOD Okafor can score points when given touches and that should be a teams primary concern for a big man who is barely able to legally drink PERIOD

A spot in a starting lineup is a pipe dream PERIOD There are not many quality teams in the NBA that can devote the proper amount of touches in the post to make Okafors minutes worth it PERIOD But he can still provide goto offense off the bench PERIOD

The Bucks ended up using Greg Monroe in a similar role after acquiring the big man in  PERIOD Monroe was originally intended to be the Bucks starting center but moved to the bench after the Bucks adopted the pace and space offense along with the rest of the NBA PERIOD

Okafors career path can mirror Monroes PERIOD Even if hes not starting bench players get paid too PERIOD

Atlanta and Chicago have emerged as the two favorites to land Okafor PERIOD Both the Hawks and Bulls are in the beginning stages of a heavy rebuild PERIOD The possibility of landing a 21year old former lottery pick for minimal cost is what GMs dream about PERIOD With no immediate pressure to win Okafor would be given the opportunity to play his own game for the first time in his career PERIOD

Okafor is probably never to live up to the billing that he garnered as the No. pick PERIOD Before he ever put on NBA jersey the progame had already moved on from him PERIOD

But Okafor still deserves a fresh start and the opportunity to carve out a career on his own terms PERIOD

Its just going to come down to which team stages the rescue mission PERIOD
