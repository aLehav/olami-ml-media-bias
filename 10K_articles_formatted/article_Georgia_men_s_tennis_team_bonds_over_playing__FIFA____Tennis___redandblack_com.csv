The No PERIOD 20ranked University of Georgia mens tennis team faced No PERIOD 12ranked Mississippi State University in a dual match at the Dan Magill Tennis Complex in Athens Georgia on Friday March   PERIOD Mississippi State defeated Georgia  PERIOD PhotoVira Halim www.virahalim.wordpress.com

For college athletes college life can be difficult they get up at unruly hours and have to work out and practice for the majority of the day PERIOD And not to mention they have the added responsibility of making sure theyre on top of their homework PERIOD

However as the sun falls and night time begins there is one activity that keeps the Georgia mens tennis teams minds at bay playing the popular video game 

Inside Jan Zielinskis dorm in East Campus Village lies an Xbox One with four controllers gearing up for a  match PERIOD The usual players are Nathan Ponwith and Alex Diaz but occasionally the entire team likes to get in on the action PERIOD

With four controllers they opt to play a twoontwo match PERIOD On certain occasions the team will play for  Which means whoever loses the  match will have to bend down by the net and the winners will serve the tennis ball at their butt during the next practice PERIOD

You just get hit in the ass real hard and it hurts Ponwith said PERIOD Just get hit in the ass real hard by a ball but you get over it PERIOD You play like a game and winner stands by the server line. ponwith who is a sophomore remembers when he lost a  match his freshman year PERIOD He was so mad that he ended up throwing a chair at the wall PERIOD He had no explanation as to why he did it but says it could be because he was caught up in the moment PERIOD

I got kind of angry and I threw a chair at the wall pretty good Ponwith said PERIOD I dont really know how to chalk it up but it was just chair in the wall. the players dont restrict the game of FIFA just to their dorm rooms they also bring it on road trips PERIOD

During the SEC tournament last year Zielinski brought his Xbox One for the road trip to Knoxville Tennessee so the team could play some FIFA on the road PERIOD The Bulldogs took a charter bus so they had a TV in there PERIOD All they had to do was hook everything up PERIOD

The entire team wanted to play but with only four controllers the losing team had to alternate out PERIOD They played for the entire trip PERIOD

The FIFA was on for four or five hours Zielinski said PERIOD We were just having fun there is not much we can do on the bus PERIOD When we dont have school to do or there is nothing else going on we just try to kill time as best as we can PERIOD I think playing FIFA is a great way to kill time. prior to this year Zielinski would play with the current mens tennis manager Chanmeet Narang PERIOD As Zielinski recalls they had a FIFA session that lasted for four hours PERIOD Whenever Zielinski plays  he likes to pick his favorite team Barcelona PERIOD

When he is not playing FIFA Zielinski tries his best to catch the Barcelona games on his phone but he always keeps up to date with the results PERIOD Zielinski got a chance to visit the famous Camp Nou stadium when he was  years old PERIOD

He was in Spain because he was competing in the G1 Juniors Tournament in the Juan Carlos Ferrero Academy PERIOD He remembers walking past the trophies and the Hall of Fame PERIOD He even has a small Barcelona soccer ball that he uses to warm up before he gets out to the Tennis court PERIOD

Even though not everyone on the team follows soccer as closely as Zielinski theyve found a way to gather around the sport PERIOD

Playing FIFA definitely is a fun activity that we can all do together Ponwith said PERIOD Its something that we can hang out and do together. class of  fivestar recruit Trent Bryde of Suwanee Georgia has signed a national letter intent to play for the the University of Georgia mens tennis team PERIOD
