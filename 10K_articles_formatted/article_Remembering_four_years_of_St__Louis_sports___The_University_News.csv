3634,2018-10-10,"i still have the ticket stub in my wallet PERIOD Before the game it was selling for  to  and in some cases more PERIOD

After the game some lady offered me  for it PERIOD No way PERIOD I had just seen history PERIOD I had just stood among  people to watch a line drive just barely clear the fence and put a new number in the historic baseball record book PERIOD

Years from now there may be hundreds of thousands of people who could claim to be at that game PERIOD But I want to make sure I have proof PERIOD Mark McGwire had just given me my first great St PERIOD Louis moment PERIOD

 Dec PERIOD   PERIOD The Billikens are taking on the Kansas Jayhawks PERIOD I made the drive up from Kansas City with four of my friends all of whom attend KU PERIOD

I remember all the trashtalk being thrown my way that day on the ride up PERIOD I remember that night in the Kiel Center PERIOD I have never heard an arena so loud PERIOD

It was one of the only times Saint Louis University had a true collegebasketball atmosphere PERIOD I remember the drive back almost complete silence except for the snickers coming from me PERIOD I think my friends were too shocked to speak PERIOD I mean who would have expected that a little Catholic school like SLU could put such a beating on the talentladen Jayhawks PERIOD

 Until the spring of my freshman year in  SLU hadnt beaten Cincinnati in something like  years PERIOD But this was the game that proved SLU belonged in Conference USA PERIOD

SLU played like a championship team PERIOD Every time the Bearcats tried to put the game away the Billikens came roaring back PERIOD We charged the court when SLU came away with the win PERIOD

 I watched with all of my friends in complete silence as Mike Jones wrapped his arms around the Titans receiver PERIOD An instant before the entire room exploded into mindnumbing celebration you could hear the collective sigh of relief PERIOD

It was the sigh of victory PERIOD A prelude to complete joy PERIOD

And even though you couldnt pay most people to cheer on the Rams  months before we cheered as if we had lived and died Rams football all of our lives PERIOD

 While my friends went skiing I was on the couch in Colorado for spring break watching as Kenyon Martin broke his leg PERIOD

I continued to watch intently as Justin Love led the Billikens to one of the most improbable wins I have ever seen over a Cincinnati team that had beaten SLU by  points only a few weeks before PERIOD

I followed on television through the Conference USA tournament as they stole their way into the only NCAA Tournament in my four years in college PERIOD

 I remember the phone call I received after writing my second commentary PERIOD It was from a friend of mine on the mens soccer team PERIOD It sounded something like this PERIOD

Ryan I had no idea it would get this kind of reaction but you might want to keep an eye on whos walking behind you because the guys are really upset PERIOD Theres talk of you getting a serious beatdown. oops PERIOD The bad news is that I was now a targeted man by people who could probably beat the snot out of me PERIOD

The good news was that people were reading what I was writing PERIOD I figured it was a fair tradeoff PERIOD Who knew anyone outside of Europe would be so emotional over soccer

 Its hard to believe my time at SLU is done PERIOD It feels like only yesterday that I was sitting in Busch Stadium watching McGwire slapping the hands of the Chicago Cubs infielders as he rounded the bases PERIOD SLU has given me so many great memories and opportunities PERIOD

All I can do in return is offer my thanks PERIOD Thanks to The University News for giving some random guy with no real experience a chance to share his feelings on sports and SLU PERIOD

Thanks to my sports editor Mark who simply trusted that Id write something worth reading and for never yelling at me when I missed the deadline something that happened every week PERIOD

Thanks to the copy editors who corrected all of my mistakes and trust me they definitely have their work cut out for them when theyre correcting my writing PERIOD

Most of all thanks to everyone who read this column PERIOD There are more people than I can count who have gone out of their way to let me know they have enjoyed something I have written PERIOD

And even a few who let me know how much they didnt like what I write PERIOD You are the reason I kept on writing PERIOD

Thank you for giving me a reason to share my opinions with the small community we like to call SLU PERIOD
