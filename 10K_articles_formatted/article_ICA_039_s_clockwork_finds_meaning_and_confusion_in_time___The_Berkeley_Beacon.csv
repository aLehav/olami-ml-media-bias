7908,2023-11-01,"upon looking through the glass entrance to the Institute of Contemporary Art curious viewers are beckoned by the Technicolor looking glasses of Ugo Rondinones iclockwork for oraclesi PERIOD The Swiss artists installation graces the Sandra and Gerald Fineberg Art Wall and greets visitors in the foyer of the ICA PERIOD

Mounted to it are  rectangular mirrors each framed and divided by thin wooden panels and made to look like brightly tinted windows PERIOD Reflections of popping pink electric indigo and highlighter yellow accent their mesmerizing surfaces PERIOD Each mirror varies in size and placement lending a transcendent hippie feel to a nearly overstimulating visual PERIOD

The backdrop for his windows is seamlessly constructed wallpaper sectioned together by hundreds of whitewashed pages taken straight out of iThe Boston Globei PERIOD

Boasting just as many ads as articles and following no chronology it seems the artist chose pages that would provide an appealing condition for the frames PERIOD

Overall the newspaper spread gives an artistically monotonous vibe to the passage of time underlying his glassy panes and it tones down its hypnotic qualities PERIOD Instead of looking like bizarre hallucinations they are transformed into a series of imaginative introspective portals reminiscent of a childs kaleidoscope PERIOD

As the title suggests Rondinone uses this opportunity to explore the mystical nature of time in the spatial practices of art PERIOD As implied by the placard description he attempts to combine the precision of the past the perplexity of the present and the wonder of the future into one stupefying space PERIOD

Unfortunately pensive as it may be the artworks supposed meaning doesnt always shine through PERIOD

Each window is meant to represent a week in the transpiring of a year PERIOD The wall is designed to simply reproduce a makeshift calendar of perception PERIOD

Clarifications aside his attempt is unlikely to be recognized en masse PERIOD If not for the daily print history behind it no simple spectator would guess at Rondinones intention and even with iThe Globei as a constant reminder of the past his desired effect is still puzzlingly elusive PERIOD

Even so his end product is so fascinating it hardly matters whether his true intentions surface successfully PERIOD The beautiful mystery of time is immeasurably or measureably maintained PERIOD

The title iclockwork for oraclesi is a line from the poetry of Edmond Jabes a Parisian postWorld War II poet known for his literary illustrations of Judaism and exile PERIOD

According to the ICAs biographical description of Rondinone the artist wrote an email to Nicholas Baume chief curator at the museum expressing that he admires Jabess poetry because it reveals a mystical attention to religious experience coupled with a real engagement with daily human conditions. through this lens one can appreciate Rondinones radical mirrors they uncover the human relationship to time felt interpersonally and spiritually PERIOD

In that sense the wall of art invites its audience to stop reflect and intake the amazing sight whether cognizant of the ticking clock or not PERIOD

iThe Sandra and Gerald Fineberg Art Wall installationi clockwork for oracles iwill remain on display until November  PERIOD i
