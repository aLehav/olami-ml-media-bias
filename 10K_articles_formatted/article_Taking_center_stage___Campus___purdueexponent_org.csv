Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm















An apocalyptic Menards a sinful trip to Ohio and a town hall in LazyTown were just some of the scenes during Ad Liberations Friday night performance which was set against a backdrop of laughter and cheering from the audience PERIOD

Ad Liberation one of several improv comedy groups on Purdues campus had their first show of the semester in Matthews Hall and performed in front of an audience of over  people PERIOD

An eclectic mix of professors students locals and staff swarmed into the crowded theater to laugh along with games skits and banter that lasted for over an hour PERIOD

The event was hosted at the same time as improv group Crazy Monkeys performed for a larger audience at Stewart Center on the other side of campus PERIOD But members of Ad Liberation stressed that there was no competition between the two groups PERIOD

We have a great relationship with all of the other comedy groups said Adrik Herbert a junior in the College of Engineering and the president of Ad Liberation PERIOD We all have our own quirks and that prevents any tension between the groups. one of the quirks that defines Ad Liberation according to its members is its style PERIOD While other comedy groups on campus may break their shows into shortform segments Ad Liberation performs in a longform style spending longer amounts of time on particular games skits and jokes PERIOD

Its what makes us kind of different from other groups on campus said Amanda Bolen Ad Liberations practice captain and senior in the College of Engineering PERIOD We always have shortform games to start but longform is our main draw. ad Liberation is the newest of comedy troupes that perform across Purdues campus every week having been founded only  years ago PERIOD

Since then their members referred to as robots during their shows have managed to craft a show that draws significant audiences every week barring bad scheduling or unforeseen circumstances PERIOD

We had a show last semester on the Friday before Fall Break PERIOD I dont think were going to do that again Herbert said PERIOD We didnt have that many people in the audience and it was really difficult to keep the energy up. ad Liberations shows depend on cooperation with the audience PERIOD Throughout the event audience members will shout suggestions for scenarios or answer questions posed to them from stage PERIOD In Bolens opinion the level of audience engagement at a particular show can make or break the night PERIOD

Everything about the show is tailored to what the audience wants to see PERIOD Its completely what the audience makes it. bolen said PERIOD

Despite the relative youth of the troupe Ad Liberation still manages to draw significant audiences every week sometimes topping  people PERIOD

We kind of have our own cult following Herbert said PERIOD Theres definitely people who come to the shows every time. an important aspect of all improv groups is camaraderie between the members Herbert said PERIOD

Theyre such a great group of friends to hang out with said Hugh Grennan the newest member of Ad Liberation PERIOD Grennan said the robots of Ad Liberation not only practice together twice a week but also spend time together almost every day PERIOD

Its just a really great community to be a part of. grennan said PERIOD

According to members of Ad Liberation cooperation is the defining characteristic of the group above everything else PERIOD Not just cooperation with each other or with an audience but also with the other improv comedy groups PERIOD

Herbert said the ultimate expression of this cooperation will come on March  when every comedy group on campus is set to perform together in one large show that will last for over two hours PERIOD

The participating groups will mix comedy styles swap jokes and play games together for what Herbert hopes will be a large audience PERIOD

Its going to be the largest comedy show in Purdues history Herbert said PERIOD
