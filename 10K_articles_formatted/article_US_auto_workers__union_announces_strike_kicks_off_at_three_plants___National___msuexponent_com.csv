The US auto workers union announced the start of a strike at three factories just after midnight on Friday as a deadline expired to reach a deal with employers on a new contract PERIOD

 the United Auto Workers union said in a post on social media platform X adding that workers were striking at plants for General Motors Stellantis and Ford PERIOD

 UAW President Shawn Fain said in a webcast two hours before the midnight contract expiration at the three major automakers PERIOD

Fain said the union would strike at one plant at each company a GM plant in Wentzville Missouri a Stellantis facility in Toledo Ohio and a Ford plant in Wayne Michigan but only the final assembly and paint operations PERIOD

About  workers were walking off the job Friday after employers and the union  which represents about  workers  failed to reach a lastminute agreement PERIOD

Fain has described the targeted strike as aimed to maximize pressure on the companies while negotiations continue PERIOD

Ford which had complained about the UAWs slow response to its latest offer received at  pm a counteroffer with what it called  terms PERIOD

 the company said adding that it  towards electric vehicles PERIOD

General Motors and Stellantis did not immediately comment PERIOD

On Thursday General Motors upped its offer lifting a proposed wage increase to  percent PERIOD The company had previously proposed an  percent rise according to the UAW PERIOD

A prolonged conflict could prove bad news for President Joe Bidens reelection campaign as voters are already unhappy about stubborn inflation PERIOD

On Thursday evening he spoke by telephone with Fain and the heads of major automakers to discuss the ongoing negotiations PERIOD

After a lengthy period of union defensiveness Fain has seen the current tight labor market as an opportunity to push through major gains PERIOD The negotiations also come as the Detroit Three remain buoyed by a period of profitability PERIOD

In a presentation on Wednesday Fain described the plan of a gradually expanding strike as aiming to keep the companies off balance and maximize the unions bargaining position PERIOD

He has told local unions to be in a  in case their factories are enlisted in the strike said Michael Spencer vice president of UAW Local  which represents  workers at Stellantis Ram factory in Sterling Heights Michigan PERIOD

Spencer and other leaders at the union are devising strike plans in which workers would do scheduled fivehour strike shifts manning the plants  entrances to create a visible UAW presence PERIOD

 said Spencer who noted the goal is not to hurt consumers or the company PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

Spencer said wages have not kept up with the cost of living which means Stellantis workers cannot afford the vehicles they make PERIOD The Ram  pickup can cost between  and  depending on the trim level PERIOD

Other sticking points include raising pay and benefits for temporary and junior employees at lower tiers who currently make as little as  per hour compared with the top rate of  an hour PERIOD

The UAWs demands include a 40percent hike in wages which Fain has said is needed to match rises in CEO pay PERIOD

Analysts have said a lengthy strike would put pressure on suppliers who might be forced to lay off workers in a move that could slow a recovery when the strike ends PERIOD

The worstcase scenario would be a lengthy strike at all three companies dampening consumer spending and weighing on the economy in the Great Lakes region Canada and beyond PERIOD
