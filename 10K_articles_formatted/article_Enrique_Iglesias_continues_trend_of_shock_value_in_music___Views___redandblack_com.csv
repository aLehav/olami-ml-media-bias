Enrique Iglesias has begun to employ the same shockandawe tactics that made Miley Cyrus notorious PERIOD

Its only February and we already have what people are calling this years Blurred Lines. enrique Iglesias released his latest music video Im a Freak feat PERIOD Pitbull on Jan PERIOD  and it has already received more than six million views on YouTube PERIOD The video features Iglesias and Pitbull grinding dancing and partying with a house filled to the brim of halfnaked young women PERIOD

With artists such as Iglesias Pitbull Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke it is clear the pop music industry has turned to embrace grabbing the attention of the public rather than focusing on art or musicality PERIOD Miley Cyruss nowinfamous VMA performance in which she dance provocatively with a foam finger may have not acquired positive attention but it got people talking about her  and this is exactly what she wanted PERIOD

Iglesias has now disappointingly jumped onto the same bandwagon PERIOD And unfortunately this belief that any type of attention is good attention may be correct PERIOD

While these artists are no longer viewed as positive role models what they are doing is actually very smart PERIOD Miley Cyruss newest album  debuted at No PERIOD  and set the record of any female pop artist in  selling  copies in the first week  all thanks to her growing reputation PERIOD It is difficult to watch a beloved pop star such as Iglesias move into this new category of stardom but odds are his record sales will skyrocket as a result PERIOD

At the age of  Iglesias seems to be far too old to be starring in this video to be honest it is almost creepy but it is clear the Spanish soloist refuses to be ignored PERIOD

Should we be angry with these artists for changing the face of music to a jawdropping sexual fiasco or do we just have to accept that this is the era we live in

The answer is not so simple PERIOD On one hand I respect Iglesias for being smart enough to know that to be successful in the music scene in  one must perform outrageously PERIOD However I become nostalgic for a time when beautiful ballads like Hero were noticed and appreciated and I am disappointed in him for being a truly talented artist who feels he has to sings songs like Im a Freak to get attention PERIOD
