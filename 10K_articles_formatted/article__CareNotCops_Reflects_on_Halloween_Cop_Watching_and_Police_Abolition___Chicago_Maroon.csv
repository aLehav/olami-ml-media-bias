2244,2022-03-16,"during the weekend of Halloween the UChicago student organization CareNotCops organized a cop watching event on fifty-third Streetthat is observing police interactions to ensure residents rights are not violated PERIOD

Originally founded in  after a University of Chicago Police Department UCPD officer shot student Charles Thomas who was wielding a metal pole during a mental health crisis CareNotCops CNC is a campaign by student organization UChicago United PERIOD According to CNC organizer Warren Wagner from the start the vision was to divest from policing and invest in care specifically mental health care. now CNC has a set of more specific demands including defunding disarming and disbanding UCPD as well as disclosing its budget PERIOD Additionally they support defunding and abolishing the Chicago Police Department CPD PERIOD

As part of their campaign CNC collaborates with local South Side community organizations including Good Kids Mad City GKMC Assatas Daughters and the LetUsBreathe Collective PERIOD

GKMC is a Black and brownled youth activist group committed to ending violence in Chicago PERIOD They led a Halloween programming event for children in response to the increased violence and police presence that historically has affected Hyde Park during the holiday season PERIOD CNC assisted GKMC in cop watching PERIOD We were basically playing a supporting role in the event they had already planned Wagner explained PERIOD

Wagner emphasized the importance of listening to local activists and leaders given that almost all UChicago students are guests in Hyde Park. to that end Wagner said that CNCs aim was just to try and deescalate and challenge police violence and if there were some conflicts between youth that was for Good Kids Mad City to handle. the week before Halloween CNC held training events for student cop watching volunteers in collaboration with the Peoples Response Team a national activist group committed to ending police violence PERIOD Additionally they met just before the event on Halloween to prepare for the night PERIOD We grouped together and went over the goals and tactics of cop watching and a couple of Know Your Rights things CNC organizer Sahar Punjwani said PERIOD CNC shared some of these resources on its social media pages which included a guide for bystander intervention tips for cop watching and specific scripts for engaging with the police PERIOD

According to Wagner  to  UChicago undergraduate students turned up for the cop watching event along with several members of the National Lawyers Guild who came to observe the occasion PERIOD The group broke into four or five teams over two shifts Wagner said PERIOD

It was also an opportunity for CNC to observe University and city police in Hyde Park PERIOD On Halloween when we were in downtown Hyde Park doing the cop watching we saw huge groups of cops staring directly outside the Capital One Bank and also Sweetgreen which really indicated that these cops are prioritizing property over people Punjwani said PERIOD The people who organized the cop presence were the aldermen and the University and the business owners in the area which also indicates the overall valuation of property over people. additionally Punjwani learned of UCPDs undercover carsunmarked police vehicles used to supervise individuals when they do not think the police are watching PERIOD

Theyre just trying to use all these different tactics to continually harass the surrounding community especially Black and brown youth Punjwani said PERIOD This will keep expanding PERIOD We clearly didnt know about undercover cop carsand theyre going to expand to more insidious methods of harassment so its up to usto stop this she said PERIOD

As CNC continues its work Wagner hopes to build a base and connect people to leverage that power to make the administration come to the table. in the meantime he added were doing things like this cop watching event which directly challenges police violence not waiting for the administration. uCPD did not respond to The Maroons request for comment PERIOD
