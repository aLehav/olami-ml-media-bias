Jonathan Nichols WriterFebruary  



Humans desire community  with friends with family with church bodies with spouses PERIOD Most everyone finds himself in community in some way or another PERIOD Humans are born into it PERIOD But community isnt always good and it doesnt always work well PERIOD Communities ranging from high school cliques to the nowdefunct Soviet Union evidence the destruction that bad community can sow PERIOD In light of such disasters both large and small one might wonder  how does rich lifegiving growthinducing community come about

In his  essay Poetry and Marriage The Use of Old Forms Wendell Berry draws an analogy between the institution of marriage and the craft of poetry PERIOD He suggests that they are united by a shared element the element of form PERIOD Forms have two elements a law and a promise PERIOD When one sets out to write a poem or to marry there are certain laws that must be followed PERIOD In Berrys words definitions  settings of limits  are involved. in marriage a man is limited to one woman and however great the temptation might be to leave after a fight he cannot PERIOD In poetry the poet is limited to a structure and however great the temptation might be to leave a line unrhymed she cannot PERIOD

But paired with these laws these limits is a promise PERIOD The promise is that by submitting to the laws of the form a world of opportunity is opened that was not present before  a deeper relationship or a richer verse than could have been had before entering into the form PERIOD The two elements of form cannot be had individually to forsake the way is to forsake the possibility. marriage and poetry are both predicated on forms but they are not the only forms in the world PERIOD Another has existed as long as both  community PERIOD In its many forms community has imposed limits and opened possibilities for thousands of years PERIOD Christianity has a long tradition of communal forms ranging from the Old Testament tribes to the early church to monastic orders PERIOD

In the vein of that tradition Biola offers its students a form of community as well PERIOD The form sets out a law requiring students to take  units of Bible classes to refrain from drinking and smoking to go to chapel and stay the whole time PERIOD And it offers a promise If you do these things possibilities will open up PERIOD God will meet you and you will grow PERIOD As with marriage and poetry the promise cannot be had without the law to forsake the way is to forsake the possibility. if youre new and wondering where to find community at Biola or if youre on your way out and wondering how you missed it take a look at the form that Biola has to offer PERIOD The demands it makes can be frustrating PERIOD The tendency to skip chapel in favor of lastminute homework will not lessen as you progress through your years at Biola PERIOD You will always have chances to complain about your Bible courses and GE requirements PERIOD The opportunity to break contract with friends will always be around PERIOD

But in the moments when those temptations are most appealing consider the cost PERIOD To break the form is to give up the possibility PERIOD This does not mean that you give up the chance of community or the Christian life or a close walk with God PERIOD But it does mean that breaking contract skipping chapel and cutting corners on schoolwork comes with a price the price of the possibility of growth through submission to this form PERIOD Ultimately this is the promise of a teacher the promise of education the promise of Biola  do things our way and you will grow. youre here now for eight semesters or for one PERIOD Take the challenge Follow the form submit to the law and gain the promise PERIOD Its never too late to begin PERIOD
