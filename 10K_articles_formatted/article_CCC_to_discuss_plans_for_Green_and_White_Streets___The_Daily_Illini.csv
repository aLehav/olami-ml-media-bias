2305,2023-11-04,"the Champaign City Council will discuss zoning changes to Green Street and the possible removal of parking from White Street at Tuesdays study session at  p.m PERIOD in Council Chambers PERIOD

The zoning proposal would accommodate businesses instead of the parking spaces and large commercial buildings currently occupying the space between Third and Wright streets PERIOD

We had a plan in  called the University District Streetscape Action Plan to update Green Street said Zeba Aziz planner II for the City of Champaign PERIOD This section of Green Street is so close to the University and students and it has a bigger opportunity and potential. depending on the direction taken by the city council planners will move forward to draft a proposal for the project PERIOD

The zoning change would make development on the West side to match the East side the  and  blocks of Green Aziz said PERIOD The future development helps to move toward a more pedestrian friendly urban dense and studentfriendly street that it has the potential to be. marci Dodds Dist PERIOD  said that the proposed change would be good for the campus community PERIOD

The entrance to campus would be better looking she said PERIOD The whole corridor would be consistent and would link campus to the rest of town. the council will also discuss a proposal to remove parking on White Street between Fourth and First streets PERIOD

The proposal comes in response to changes in the Mass Transit District MTD bus routes which caused an increase in bus frequency along White Street PERIOD

There used to be one bus every  minutes or so but now there is a bus every five minutes said Rob Kowalski assistant planning director for the city of Champaign PERIOD The MTD is asking the city to remove onstreet permit parking on White Street. the city already removed onstreet parking on White between Wright and Fourth streets Kowalski said PERIOD

With parking on that one side of the street it is impossible for two buses to pass he said PERIOD This was not an issue when the bus frequency wasnt as high as it is now. kowalski said buses will use Fourth Street until construction on the drainage basins on Second Street the Boneyard Second Street Detention Project is completed PERIOD Since buses are using this route some parking remains on White between Fourth and Second streets without affecting the bus routes PERIOD

There is a financial implication to removing parking Kowalski said PERIOD We get revenue from the permits people buy to park there so we would not be getting that revenue. dodds said she has questions about parking on White Street that she will bring up during the study session PERIOD

The affect on students will be a real consideration Dodds said PERIOD The memo says that most apartments on White Street have parking for their tenants but my question is what about visitors and friends",CCC to discuss plans for Green and White Streets - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
