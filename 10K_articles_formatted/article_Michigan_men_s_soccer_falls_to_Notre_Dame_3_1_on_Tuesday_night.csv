The beginning of the game was very fast paced PERIOD One minute in the Fighting Irish scored off their first shot when forward Daniel Russo passed the ball to forward Jack Lynn who beat two Michigan defenders to put Notre Dame up one PERIOD

The Wolverines responded quickly scoring on their second shot of the game PERIOD Junior defender Evan Rasmussen netted his first career goal following a nice pass play from sophomore midfielder Bryce Blevins PERIOD

With  minutes left in the first half Michigan appeared to score and take a  lead but the goal was called off due to a controversial offside penalty PERIOD Two minutes later an opportunistic Notre Dame offense struck as Lynn scored off a transition pass from midfielder Ethan OBrien to notch his second goal of the game PERIOD

Just before the end of halftime tensions over the preceding events came to a boil as a scramble ensued between the two teams PERIOD However the fight was promptly subdued and no cards were handed out PERIOD
