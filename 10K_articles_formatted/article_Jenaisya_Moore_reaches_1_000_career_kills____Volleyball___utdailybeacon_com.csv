Jenaisya Moore  before a match against Texas State University at ThompsonBoling Arena at Food City Center Aug PERIOD   PERIOD

The Lady Vols continued their SEC winning streak by sweeping Ole Miss in three sets    PERIOD Tennessee volleyball   SEC is currently ranked No PERIOD  in the nation PERIOD

After giving the third set to Mississippi State in their last match on Friday the Lady Vols put in the work to stay polished and disciplined against Ole Miss PERIOD Tennessee still sits No PERIOD  in hitting percentage and kills per set for NCAA volleyball PERIOD

I think whether it had anything to do with Friday nights third set or not the team came in really focused after that second set head coach Eve Rackham Watt said PERIOD I thought we kind of looked determined to play well in that third set and I thought we did PERIOD Sometimes when youre up  you can pump the brakes a little bit and I thought we didnt PERIOD We just kind of continued to play the way we had been playing and even stepped it up a little bit offensively. as a team Tennessee stepped on the gas pedal when it came to hitting PERIOD Morgahn Fingall and Jenaisya Moore led the match in kills with Fingall tallying up  kills with a . hitting percentage and Moore having  with a . hitting percentage PERIOD

The game proved to be a special one for Moore as she tallied up her one thousandth career kill PERIOD

Moore played four seasons with Ohio State where she had  career kills averaging . kills per set PERIOD She has been one of the biggest highlights of the transfer class for the Lady Vols as she has excelled in hitting stats and being a point leader for the team PERIOD

Moore averages . kills per set for Tennessee PERIOD

Congratulations to Jenaisya for her one thousandth kill PERIOD Were really excited for her Rackham Watt said PERIOD I thought Morgahn had a great match PERIOD I really liked the way she picked her shots and then I thought that was as good a match as Erykah Lovett played PERIOD It was kind of a quiet . but she really just was so efficient in the swings that she had PERIOD I also thought her and Yelianiz Torres passed the ball really really well. erykah Lovett and Klaudia Pawlik also had great offensive plays for the Lady Vols PERIOD Pawlik was a force in the middle with a . hitting percentage PERIOD

The Lady Vols put pressure on Ole Misss serve receive serving up nine aces PERIOD Caroline Kerr led the match in assists with  PERIOD Kerr has been a weapon for Tennessee and is currently ranked No PERIOD  in the nation in assists per set PERIOD

I thought we did a nice job from the service line Rackham Watt said PERIOD Which I also thought we did on Friday but I felt like today we did a little bit better job of stopping their offense PERIOD So in general Im pleased with the performance and the emotional response. yelianiz Torres led the match with  digs Ashllyn King had five and Lovett contributed four PERIOD Tennessee had six blocks four of which were from Pawlik who has exhibited growth from the middle PERIOD

I thought it was a great response to Fridays performance Rackham Watt said PERIOD I thought we were really really clean PERIOD Obviously hitting . much cleaner from the offensive standpoint. the Lady Vols will continue their journey on the road to take on Alabama on Wednesday at  p.m PERIOD ET PERIOD
