VCU professors are teaching empowerment and communication skills to unhoused people in Richmond through a blend of medicine and the arts PERIOD

Its not so much about being homeless its about being people said Alan Dow assistant vice president of health sciences for interprofessional education and collaborative care at VCU PERIOD

The program helps recognize the humanity of the unhoused population and realize there are more similarities than differences between them and anyone else Dow said PERIOD

The program mainly aims to empower those experiencing homelessness while providing students and faculty in the health professions an opportunity to interact with these individuals in a nonclinical leveled playing field Dow said PERIOD

If youre adding a health crisis on top of a crisis of housing you get people that are doubling in crisis Dow said PERIOD So understandably people are not at their best. elizabeth Byland is the head of applied improv at the VCU department of theatre PERIOD She leads a program called Applied Improv to Impact Homelessness PERIOD

The class teaches transferable soft skills like effective communication selfexpression and trust in other people through improv Byland said PERIOD She said the program is the first of its kind as it addresses both the experience of homelessness among veterans and healthcare disparities that may be experienced due to it PERIOD
