2170,2022-03-16,"the University of Chicagos graduation rate for black students has grown  percent since  according to a recent study published in The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education PERIOD

The increase puts the Colleges graduation rate of black students six percentage points behind that of white students far ahead of the national average difference of  percent PERIOD

The improvements at the U of C represent a narrowing of the gap between the graduation rates of black and white students which in the late 1990s hovered around  percent said Michael Behnke vice president and dean of enrollment in the College in an email interview PERIOD

Chicago is also well ahead of the national graduation rate for black students which despite modest increases remains at a relatively low  percent PERIOD The national graduation rate for white university students is  percent PERIOD

Graduation rates for white students at the U of C averaged in the low 80s during the 1990s while the rate for blacks was near  percent PERIOD

Since the 1990s the graduation rate for black students has increased at a more rapid rate than for white students PERIOD Currently the black student graduation rate is  percent while the white student graduation rate is  percent PERIOD

While there is still work to be done the improvement is significant and very gratifying Behnke said PERIOD I think it is the result of two things PERIOD One is greater selectivity PERIOD All students have stronger preparation PERIOD The second is significantly more programmatic support. the U of C acceptance rate has declined from around  percent in the late 1990s to  percent last year according to Behnke PERIOD

The study also found that universities located in communities geographically isolated from black populations or exhibiting a less than welcoming attitude toward black students had particularly low graduation rates PERIOD

The studys authors associate the University of CaliforniaBerkeleys low graduation rate for black students with its raceblind admissions and perceived failure to provide institutional support for minority students PERIOD

Universities that consider race in admissions including Ivy League schools have seen improved graduation rates among black students according to the study PERIOD

At the University of Chicago the success is partly due to the growth and strength of initiatives geared toward minority student retention said Ana Vazquez deputy dean of students in the University and director of the Office of Minority Student Affairs OMSA PERIOD

It makes sense why some institutions have higher minority graduation rates Vazquez said PERIOD We have students that are highly motivated more institutional support more student support. in  a report commissioned as part of thenprovost Richard Sallers Initiative on Minority Issues sought to make the administration more sensitive to minority issues in the University community PERIOD

Several steps have since been taken to improve programs for minority students on campus including the restructuring of OMSA and an Admissions Office initiative to identify better minorityrecruitment strategies Vazquez said PERIOD

Vazquez expects a further narrowing in the graduation rate gap between black and white students PERIOD Upcoming changes such as the switch to the Common Application which will likely attract a larger number of minority applicants as well as OMSAs relocation to a new threestory facility will allow the University to continue its steady gains PERIOD
