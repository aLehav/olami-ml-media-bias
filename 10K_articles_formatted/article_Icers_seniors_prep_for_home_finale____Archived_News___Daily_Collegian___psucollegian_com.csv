Among the seven is senior captain Kevin Jaeger PERIOD As it stands Jaeger is second alltime on the Icers goalscoring list with  PERIOD

 Battista said PERIOD

Jaegers exploits on the ice have been well documented throughout his career PERIOD But a couple of his teammates have at best struggled to even play on senior day PERIOD Chris Rome is one such player PERIOD
