Updated November     pm





Orange Coast Colleges Global Engagement Center is home to services like the study abroad program IECOCC and the Multicultural Center as well as international students PERIOD

Orange Coast College will pause its contract with a Russian student recruitment agency in light of Russias invasion of Ukraine PERIOD The Coast Community College District CCCD Board of Trustees convened for its biweekly meeting where President Mary Hornbuckle proposed the motion on March  PERIOD The motion passed with  in favor with Vice President Lorraine Prinsky absent PERIOD

Given the state of the world today I was a little distressed to see that we have marketing agreements or educational agreements with two Russian firms and I would like to see us pause these until we get sorted in the world Hornbuckle said PERIOD

OCC participates in EducationUSA a state department program and has a yearold contract with LLC International Center of Insterstudy Russia InterStudy PERIOD No students have been recruited by InterStudy and sent to OCC according to Associate Dean of Global Engagement Nathan Jensen PERIOD

That particular agency hasnt sent us any students yet PERIOD And now because of the current situation thats why its really not likely for them to send any students anytime soon Jensen said PERIOD Students cant get a visa theres issues with money and between the countries and things like that so theres a lot of barriers to students coming now. it has been  days since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb PERIOD  catapulting the Ukrainians and the world into a time of uncertainty PERIOD As some countries show support for Ukraine and its efforts to retain its independence financial services and media companies have halted their services to the Russian people and ultimately the Russian government PERIOD

I would not want to punish Russian students for what their government is doing but I also wouldnt want to be engaged with any kind of business agreement with Russia in any way at this point Hornbuckle said during the meeting PERIOD

Hornbuckles proposal passed with a  vote PERIOD Student Trustee Roy Sahachaisere voted against the measure on the basis of not hindering student access to higher education PERIOD

Trustee Hornbuckle you nailed it on the head when you said we shouldnt have the students pay the price for what the government is doing and I mean why should we deny a student that wants to go into our school system now just because of the unfortunate circumstances of whats going on now Sahachaisere said during the meeting PERIOD

It is common for colleges to form agreements with agencies to prevent the need for travel to recruit students PERIOD We get a lot of students from a lot of the different agencies Jensen said PERIOD

Recruiting agencies are basically independent businesses that recruit students for colleges and universities PERIOD OCC has contracts with  different education agencies that recruit students from all over the world PERIOD

Per the agreement between OCC and InterStudy once students are recruited and enrolled in classes for an entire school year OCC pays a  fee for that recruitment work PERIOD According to Jensen the process is complicated PERIOD

For an international student we pay a total of  per student Jensen said PERIOD We pay part of it after the first semester of enrollment part of it to the second semester. now that the resolution passed Jensen Dean of Enrollment Services Rozanne CopocciaWhite and Vice President of Student Services Madjid Niroumand are working together to pause OCCs student recruitment agreement with InterStudy PERIOD

Weve never done it before so were kind of navigating that Jensen said PERIOD It might be a situation where we just contact that agency and say We have to pause it for a period of time and just give them a notice in writing. although the resolution passed Hornbuckle stressed that this is a request to pause OCCs agreement with InterStudy not completely abandon it PERIOD









Thank you to the student trustee for voting against this motion how will Russian students know and understand America if they cant come here and see how we live We have students here from China and Saudi Arabia and their human rights policy is awful PERIOD Shame on the Board of Trustees for seeing the long term picture and kudus to the student trustee
