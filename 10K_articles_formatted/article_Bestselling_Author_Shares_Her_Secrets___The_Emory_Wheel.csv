Kami Garcia is a supernatural force to be reckoned with PERIOD She cowrote the internationally bestselling Beautiful Creatures series with Margaret Stohl PERIOD And her newest book Unbreakable is the first in the Legion series PERIOD Unbreakable tells the tale of Kennedy Waters who learns that her mothers death was caused by paranormal forces PERIOD Now Kennedy takes her mothers place in a secret society the Legion whose goal is to protect the world from a dangerous demon PERIOD Last week I got the chance to speak with Garcia about her new book and her approach to writing PERIOD Heres what she had to say PERIOD

Q You wrote your first series Beautiful Creatures with Margaret Stohl PERIOD How has your writing process changed between writing with a partner and writing on your own

KG Okay so basically when Margi and I write together we create an outline PERIOD Then I write maybe chapter one and shell write chapter two and then we switch we swap and we actually write over each others work PERIOD Its like editing each other PERIOD Well cut things well add new things PERIOD So by the time you do that a few times some sentences basically cut out a few words of mine and a few words of hers and it becomes very seamless PERIOD And the other thing thats very convenient about it is that you never really get stuck because if youre having trouble with a scene or you get quote unquote writers block you pass it off to the other person and you have somebody else to fill in those blanks 

When I write alone my process isnt that different PERIOD I have an inspiration wall in my office PERIOD Im really visual so I have photos song lyrics quotes from poems and things like that that kind of remind me of the characters or the setting and I have this taped all over one giant wall in my office PERIOD And as Im outlining it kind of fuels the outline it kind of helps me visualize all the places and think about what Im going to be writing about PERIOD And then I do a pretty loose outline where I basically just outline the main plot points PERIOD And then I start writing PERIOD Im really linear I dont skip around a lot PERIOD I do veer off the outlines sometimes but my main beats pretty much always remain the same and I always know how the story is going to end  Im kind of skeletal my first drafts are pretty much the framework and then I go in in the second draft and I kind of layer in and add the details and more description the meat on the bones PERIOD

Q What sort of research did you do in order to write the book in terms of the secret societies and the supernatural

KG Oh my God what kind of research didnt I do Research is probably my favorite part PERIOD Its also one of my great procrastinating techniques because I could read forever  Id never write a word PERIOD I read a lot of grimoires old magical books written by the clergy about summoning demons and theology and alchemy what they believed magic was PERIOD And also about different kinds of protective symbols and wards throughout different cultures which also comes back to symbolism PERIOD The Illuminati was huge on symbols and I did research on the way the Illuminati morphed from a group of enlightened scientists to more of a political turn PERIOD And then I created my own mythology as well PERIOD I feel like its easier to suspend disbelief if you start with a place of truth PERIOD So if you start with some true history and then you turn that upside down or you veer off to the left its a lot easier for readers to buy into it PERIOD

Q Youve said youre very superstitious PERIOD What is your biggest superstition and has it ever played a part in Unbreakable or Beautiful Creatures

KG Oh my gosh my superstitions play a part  I guess in a weird way you know I write about really scary magical mystical things PERIOD And a lot of the things I write about scare me PERIOD And I think subconsciously maybe my crazy superstitions are my way that I balance that that I manage it so that I can write about the scary and creepy things without freaking myself out PERIOD Because everyones always like oh my God how do you read about that stuff how do you read about haunted places and sleep at night And Im like I dont know PERIOD But I cant see a horror movie without having bad dreams PERIOD So its weird PERIOD

Q I have a question about the inspiration wall PERIOD Do you create that before you start writing or is it an ongoing process

KG I start it before and then its ongoing PERIOD So I usually have a whole bunch of images mood kind of images PERIOD So for Unbreakable I had a lot of pictures of spirits old houses and buildings or abandoned places that reminded me of details and things or just set the mood of what I was trying to create PERIOD And then Ill add more as I go on and figure out who the characters are or write about a place  Im really visual PERIOD I went to George Washington University and before I decided I wanted to teach I was a fine arts major PERIOD I wanted to be a painter PERIOD So for me everything starts with the image and then it goes from there PERIOD You know how they say reading a book is like a movie in your mind For me it really is PERIOD I see the scenes playing out and I feel like my job is to record them in the best way possible before I forget PERIOD

Q So would you say that you actually watch the scenes and are just recording them or do you come up with the scenes and as youre coming up with them youre visualizing them

KG Well I usually have some idea of what it is before I start writing PERIOD I usually know where its going to be what the setting is and what I need to accomplish in the scene PERIOD I might know were going to be in Kennedys bedroom the spirits going to come and the boys are going to burst in PERIOD But then as Im writing Im visualizing PERIOD Im actually watching the scene and Im thinking okay shes asleep shes in her bed she hears a sound and Im typing as Im thinking about it PERIOD And then when theres dialogue I actually listen like I hear them talking PERIOD One thing I figured out is that you generally can write a lot faster if you go in with some plan PERIOD Even if you end up veering away from the plan just the idea of having the plan helps you move faster PERIOD So I try to have the key points of the scene in my mind and the writing is filling in all the blanks and fleshing them out in a fun way so that theyre really visceral and really visual instead of just you know the boys burst in and they rescue her PERIOD I want to hear it and feel it and see it PERIOD

Q Whats the top reason that someone should pick up Unbreakable

KG I think that if you enjoy paranormal fast pace and a lot of twists and turns then youd definitely enjoy the book PERIOD And I think it has a kind of Supernatural the TV show Supernatural meets The Da Vinci Code vibe PERIOD At the heart its really suspense PERIOD Its got romance and it has some kind of dark elements but its really suspense PERIOD Its really about the element of the unexpected PERIOD

Although the convenience of email cannot be denied the act of receiving and reading a snailmail letter is by far the better experience PERIOD So kudos to youI understand that the letters are not personalized but are they physically signed by the sender That would be such a nice touch  and a single for which Id gladly pay more PERIOD Perhaps the sender could sign a small percentage so that a randomly chosen few every week would have a very little extra thrill PERIOD That possibility would absolutely make my heart race a bit faster as I tore open the envelope
