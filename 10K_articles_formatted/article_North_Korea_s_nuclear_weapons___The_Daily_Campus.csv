8312,2023-10-25,"north Korea announced Monday that it had conducted its first nuclear weapons test confirming once and for all that the country has been and is still seriously developing a nuclear weapons program PERIOD While there is currently much speculation regarding the success of the test it should nevertheless be a catalyst for the United States and its allies to develop a firm policy for dealing with North Korea PERIOD One that works toward stopping proliferation of nuclear technology in the country immediately PERIOD

Since North Korea first declared that it was going to quit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in  its aim to develop nuclear weapons technology has been clear PERIOD And although the U.S PERIOD and its allies worked thereafter on negotiating with North Korea the threat posed by the country has been dangerously ignored or exacerbated by the U.S PERIOD during the past five years PERIOD Before any talks with North Korea were conducted during the Bush administration the President labeled the country as part of an axis of evil and a year later North Korea quit the Nuclear Nonproliferation treaty PERIOD The talks that occurred subsequently were totally unproductive PERIOD

While North Koreas nuclear ambitions would not have been completely quelled by talks with the Bush administration preaxisofevilaccusations our country probably could have done more to stall North Koreas nuclear capacity had negotiations been attempted before comparisons with terrorists were made PERIOD

Before this crisis progresses any further immediate action must be taken PERIOD We cannot afford to repeat our past mistake of not treating North Korea like the serious threat it is PERIOD Analysts are occupying themselves by discussing the apparent failure of the test pointing to the relatively small output as evidence that North Korea does not currently have the capacity to launch a nuclear attack or provide to other countries nuclear weapons of any great magnitude PERIOD This may be a comforting analysis as it eliminates the possibility of an immediate threat but it ignores the fact that while North Korea may not have perfected its nuclear technology now it will most likely be able to given enough time PERIOD

There is no foolproof way of dealing with the situation PERIOD The world cannot meet the threat of violence with violence PERIOD Attacking North Korea is not the correct solution at this time PERIOD Likewise however the world cannot afford the allow North Korea to get away with what it has in to past a new compromise has to contain stricter consequences than denying North Korea promised aid as it is evident that when denied aid or angered in some other way the country simply resumes its nuclear program PERIOD The U.S PERIOD must develop a new policy with its allies that confronts the crisis in North Korea while recognizing that the countrys nuclear capacity is stronger than ever PERIOD
