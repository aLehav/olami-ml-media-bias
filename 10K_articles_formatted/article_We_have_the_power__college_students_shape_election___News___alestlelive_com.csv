Being informed about any major topic is undoubtedly important PERIOD When topics begin to affect someone personally they typically become even more important PERIOD

Some may think the presidency does not directly affect students but it definitely does PERIOD Issues such as how college tuition will be funded healthcare laws and others can affect American college students in a big way PERIOD

College students have as much say as all other Americans in how their lives money and bodies will be governed in the future when they are registered to vote PERIOD To vote is to have power and every able student should take full advantage of it PERIOD

College students are one of the least likely groups to vote so we are working to change that by tabling in the buildings that include the majors that are less likely to vote like engineering and life science freshman biology major and Student Government Vice Chair for Voting Initiatives Natalie Reczek said PERIOD

Being informed on each and every candidate is crucial for making the decision on the candidate that one chooses to cast their vote for PERIOD There are many resources on campus that can aid in becoming more aware of different candidates political platforms PERIOD

I encourage all voters to ensure they know all the topics and research the candidates before making their decision on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD I also want students to ensure that they are open to others opinions Student Body President Luke Jansen said PERIOD

Political opinions are not something that should tear us apart PERIOD Others may have a political opinion that differs from your own but you are different people Jansen said PERIOD We do not all have to agree on everything but we do have to remember that in the end we are all humans and should treat one another with respect no matter if it is an election year or not. two student organizations College Democrats and College Republicans are active groups on campus and they invite anyone interested to attend their meetings PERIOD

I always visit the candidates website to see where they stand on issues senior political science major and Vice President of SIUE College Democrats Nick Raftopoulos said PERIOD

I think it is a good idea as a school for professors to have information on their Blackboard about different candidates sophomore political science and international studies major and member of College Democrats Rahime Aliu said PERIOD

Of course being informed on the issues in pointless if students dont register and vote PERIOD

One of the first steps that needs to be taken care of before voting would be to register PERIOD

If youre not registered yet you can register in person on the day of the election in the MUC PERIOD You need your drivers license and two forms of address Reczek said PERIOD

Typically college students run into issues with voting because they are registered in their hometowns county rather than their universitys county PERIOD A simple solution to that is applying for an absentee ballot which is not as difficult as some believe PERIOD

To get an absentee ballot you need to be already registered and have voted in one election already PERIOD Then you can go to your countys website and either complete it online or print it and mail it in PERIOD And if you havent voted before you need to go to your county and get registered to vote absentee Reczek said PERIOD

Being an active member in the political world may not be everyones favorite thing but in order for the best actions to be taken for students it is crucial for students to vote PERIOD Get out register and go to the polls on Election Day PERIOD

To find out where you are able to vote simply Google where can I vote and a search box will appear that allows you to show all locations where you can cast your vote in this election PERIOD













Indeed the choice between Republicans and Democrats have an important impact on students PERIOD First of all this would be decisive for which education reforms would be done PERIOD Normally most of the laws make education system in schools and colleges stricter PERIOD Students find it difficult to handle new types of academic assignments PERIOD Thanks god there exists review essay writing service where you can find an a good essay writing company to write a good essay for you PERIOD If you face the same challenges than you should definitely visit this page PERIOD
