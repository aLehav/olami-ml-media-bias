1529,2004-02-25,"all TCU PERIOD All the time PERIOD

The university is evaluating its graduate programs to determine whether to recruit more graduate students or start new doctorategranting programs PERIOD

A committee from Chancellor Victor Boschinis Vision in Action program a longterm strategic planning program is looking into the role of graduate education at TCU PERIOD

William Koehler provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs said he would like to see an increase in the number of doctorateseeking students PERIOD

We want to have more graduate students and we want the quality to remain high he said PERIOD

Having more graduate programs would help attract students as well Koehler said PERIOD

It may have a positive impact on recruiting graduate students he said PERIOD

Adding graduate programs could impact TCUs standing in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education PERIOD The Carnegie Classification was first published in  and separated doctorategranting institutions into four categories Research Universities I and II and Doctoral Universities I and II PERIOD Research institutions were categorized by the number of doctoral degrees awarded as well as the amount of federal funding received PERIOD

However these categories were condensed into two sets for the  classification DoctoralResearch UniversitiesExtensive and DoctoralResearch UniversitiesIntensive the former category awards more graduate degrees PERIOD The change was made after the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching decided federal funding was not an adequate indication of research activity PERIOD

TCU is currently classified as a DoctoralResearch UniversityIntensive along with  other institutions PERIOD Of the  faculty research schools  are private schools PERIOD This means TCU fits into a category of schools that during the period analyzed awarded at least  doctoral degrees per year PERIOD

The categories are not intended as tools for measuring university quality Boschini said PERIOD

The classifications themselves were never meant to establish a hierarchy of schools he said PERIOD

The  Carnegie Classification categorizes institutions based on their performance from fall of  through spring of  PERIOD The next classification report is due in  PERIOD

As chancellor I would say that we are currently classified correctly  and for that I am happy Boschini said PERIOD

If TCU decided to place more emphasis on graduate education the university could possibly move up to the category that offers more graduate degrees PERIOD DoctoralResearch UniversitiesExtensive award  or more doctoral degrees per year across  or more disciplines PERIOD Private universities comprise  of  of these nationwide PERIOD

In the past TCU has not been interested changing categories Koehler said PERIOD

It would be a total change in culture he said PERIOD But I dont want the past to dictate the future. tCU currently offers Ph.D PERIOD degrees in areas including English history physics psychology chemistry pastoral theology and Biblical interpretation PERIOD

Becoming a DoctorateResearch UniversityExtensive school would require TCU to make dramatic changes Koehler said PERIOD

TCU now promotes the teacherscholar model in which faculty do research as well as teach PERIOD The university would change to promoting the scholar model with a focus on student research Koehler said PERIOD Student and facultyconducted research is expensive and would require more lab facilities as well as grants to fund projects PERIOD

There would have to be an infusion of enormous sums of money he said PERIOD

TCUs fact book lists a group of  universities which TCU calls its peer group PERIOD Of these schools  are DoctoralResearch UniversitiesExtensive PERIOD Two are ranked as DoctoralResearchIntensive and two are Masters Colleges and Universities I PERIOD

I personally do not think that our Carnegie category has much to do at all with how we compete with other institutions Boschini said PERIOD

Increasing graduate programs would benefit undergraduates as well as graduate students said Sherrie Reynolds director of graduate studies for the School of Education PERIOD Having more graduate programs would help attract faculty she said PERIOD

What a graduate presence does is bring in faculty specialists in a certain area she said PERIOD Thats exciting for undergraduates to learn from those people.",Grad programsâ€™ role explored  | TCU 360,Texas Christian University
