7872,2023-11-01,"black professors make up  percent of all Emerson faculty but their images appear far more often in the colleges promotional material and publications a iBeaconi survey of those materials has found PERIOD

In fact three professors who have filed discrimination complaints have played prominent roles in selling Emerson to prospective students PERIOD Those professors and several college administrators say the discrepancy between real and promoted diversity at Emerson is no accident PERIOD

Professors Roger House and Pierre Desir who have filed discrimination complaints against Emerson with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination as well as film professor Claire AndradeWatkins who had to sue the college in  to gain tenure have all been featured in recruitment efforts and pamphlets PERIOD Emersons admission materials often prominently feature minority professors to potential students even as the college has historically denied academic tenure to nonwhite candidates PERIOD

Just three years after she won her bitter discrimination lawsuit against Emerson the college featured AndradeWatkins on the cover of its admission viewbooks PERIOD In her case AndradeWatkins successfully argued Emerson had denied her tenure because she was black the same reason she said she was sought out for a promotional photo shoot PERIOD

They came and took pictures of me like glamour shots she said in an interview in her office in February PERIOD

Director of Creative Services Chuck Dunham who designs admission packets said he receives directives to use photos of multicultural students and faculty in recruitment packets from admission officials PERIOD When asked if he thought including more black students in admission materials helps recruit black students he said I think a lot of people go by that. you try to represent the colleges make up and diversity in an honest way Dunham said PERIOD As someone who lays out the book I try to be honest as to what the balance is but I dont have final say PERIOD The admission office approves it. house and Desir before they were denied tenure last year were both used to promote the college PERIOD House was twice the Journalism Departments featured professor and Desir recruited black high school students to Emersons visual and media arts department where he teaches PERIOD

House a history professor was featured in the colleges  and  admission viewbooks in two nearly identical Journalism Professor Profiles. in the book House is given a fourpicture doublepage spread and his accomplishments such as documentary productions for National Public Radio and an upcoming book on Chicago blues legend Bill Broonzy are touted in a blurb below PERIOD

I allowed the college to use my image in its publications because I thought it had a genuine commitment to diversity he wrote in an email message PERIOD Unfortunately the administration lacks the will to do the right thing. dr PERIOD William Smith director of the colleges Center for Diversity acknowledged a discrepancy between Emersons recruitment and promotional materials and the actual diversity makeup of the school PERIOD

The contradiction comes from if Roger was still here and Pierre then its not false advertising he said in an interview in his office PERIOD But the inconsistency comes when the poster boy is knocked out of the box. since  Desir has worked at a summer recruitment program called YMCA Black Achievers in Greater Boston PERIOD The program brings minority high school students to Emersons campus for a motivational taste of college life and so the college can woo them PERIOD Desir said Smith approached him to represent Emersons film program at the YMCA PERIOD

When a student of color comes to visit Emerson College and sees all white faces it doesnt look welcoming Desir said explaining that he was sent to the program to help recruit black students PERIOD He is one of two black professors in Emersons VMA department PERIOD

They always put students of color up front to say Oh look at them but then I hardly have any in my classes he said PERIOD Its a diverse world out there and Emerson students are not being prepared PERIOD They use us to promote themselves as a diverse institution. smith said he was unsure of who would represent the VMA department at Black Achievers once Desir leaves Emerson PERIOD

Well thats a difficult question he said PERIOD Im going to be optimistic and say I look forward to new hires who will be diverse. dunham described a new admissions recruitment brochure he helped to design called Inclusion. the brochure which was also worked on by admissions official Ronn Beck will be sent to programs like Upward Bound the US Department of Educations plan to support the college careers of high school students from lowincome families and to guidance counselors at predominately black schools PERIOD

The packet includes a large photo of black Hispanic and Asian students and faculty on the front PERIOD On the inside there is the same photograph from the front of the Creating a Culture of Inclusion Emersons new diversity plan PERIOD

The plan released in September of last year includes strategies for the college to recruit more multicultural students and faculty PERIOD House in fact was one of the professors who worked on the plan PERIOD

In  the year he was to apply for tenure he said the Office of Academic Affairs asked him to conduct a study of the collegewide curriculum to find out how Emerson could prepare its students to work and live in a diverse society PERIOD The assignment required House to research the studies of diversity thinktanks review the policies at comparable institutions audit course syllabuses at Emerson and conduct a sample survey of students and faculty PERIOD

In truth it was hardly an assignment for one junior professor without expertise or resources House said in a followup email message PERIOD In comparison Boston University and Harvard University had established special committees of faculty members and administrators to conduct similar curriculum evaluations PERIOD When conducting the study I continued to teach courses serve on other committees work on research and prepare for the tenure process. house said he submitted his report to the Office of Academic Affairs several months later and his work inspired Goal Four of the diversity plan which outlines diverse curriculum. however he said he remains perplexed and disappointed at the course of events after submitting the study PERIOD

First the Office of Academic Affairs used my work without saying as much as Thank you House said PERIOD Then it recommended that my application for tenure and promotion be denied. smith said the way Academic Affairs treats professors handicaps the efforts of the Admission Office and Center for Diversity to increase diversity at Emerson PERIOD

It doesnt make me feel good PERIOD One unit is doing really good work and another unit of the college is having difficulty he said PERIOD In the work that I do it presents a huge negative. cancel reply
