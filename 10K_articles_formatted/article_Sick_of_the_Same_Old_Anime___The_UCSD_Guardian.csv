My most recent ponder takes me down memory lane  or more specifically to that corner of Library Walk where a little shack of Japanese knickknacks and cell phone accessories stands every other week PERIOD I dont make a habit of visiting this shop but sometimes I find myself in a terrible bout of nostalgia that forces me to take a peek PERIOD You see I  like a sizable handful of other nerds on this campus  was one of those kids who grew up most identifying with the weird Japanese action figures comics and television shows that populated hobby shops and the Internet PERIOD

Luckily these days Im strong enough to walk past a window display of action figures and not experience an overwhelming urge to buy them all  though all that restraint is probably what led me to take a look around the shack PERIOD What I found most interesting this time around werent the accessories but the stacks of anime DVDs on display PERIOD To my surprise I recognized every single one  some of them dating back two decades PERIOD What should have been a heartwarming observation  that the shows I adored growing up are still somehow relevant  actually struck me with a pang of sadness PERIOD I agree that these animes are classics to keep around but where are all the new ones

I grew up in a sort of golden age of anime PERIOD The shows that typified my childhood were dense and highly sophisticated sociological and philosophical commentaries romantic transvestite martialarts comedies laced with bestiality and robot apocalypses centered on religion life and death PERIOD Today the most popular animes are typified by conflicts between the same old badasses and newbiewithhiddenpotential protagonists  an triedandtrue conceit but without any depth to keep my eyes open PERIOD What happened to the nuances Its as if all the new shows are mashups of old formulas PERIOD

Perhaps Im just giving them a hard time or becoming that old guy who doesnt get it and has a hard time adapting to generational change PERIOD Perhaps anime has always been like this every new show simply a revision of a previous one PERIOD Perhaps all media follows this pattern and Im in denial PERIOD

But come on  does it all have to be so terrible Im all for reintroducing old concepts in new shells but only when theyve got some sort of fresh idea involved PERIOD I cant be the only one moping over the complete rut of creativity and progress in which an industry I once adored has recently been stuck PERIOD

Guess Ill just go take my place in the hall of purists where hiphop heads scowl at the new school of sameness and grandparents spit on anything fancier than the phonograph PERIOD
