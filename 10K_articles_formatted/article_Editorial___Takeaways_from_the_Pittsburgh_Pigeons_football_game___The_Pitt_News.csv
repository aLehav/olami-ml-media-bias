Pigeons on the field of Acrisure Stadium Saturday evening PERIOD

By  The Pitt News Editorial Board October  

While there may have been a football game at Acrisure Stadium on Saturday that some people were interested in the real game happened between the pigeons on the field PERIOD They swooped in and wouldnt leave the field  partially because they couldnt figure out how to exit the stadium and partially to dominate in a game of their own pigeon football against the Virginia Tech Vultures PERIOD

Kenny Pigeon the former quarterback for the Pittsburgh Pigeons came back to show Kedon Slovis how its done PERIOD While Slovis missed easy openings right and left and threw interceptions Kenny Pigeon flew in around the  yard line and strutted around the field even getting more first downs than the Panthers themselves

While Slovis threw a painful interception to Virginia Techs human football player Keonta Jenkins Kenny Pigeon was able to score for the Pittsburgh Pigeons PERIOD He found some peanuts that someone threw onto the field and brought the rest of the pigeons over to them to eat  a stunning feat in the game of pigeon football PERIOD

Not only did Israel Abanikanda have a great game scoring a Pitt record of six touchdowns in one game but his pigeon counterpart Israel Abeakakanda was also the only pigeon player who didnt fly into the field goal post during the game PERIOD Bravo to them both  we cant wait to see what you accomplish next

Speaking of Abanikanda he also broke former quarterback Tony Dorsetts rushing record with  yards PERIOD While we dont know how the real Dorsett felt about this Tony Dovesett the former Pittsburgh Pigeons star running back definitely had a lot to say about Abeakakandas new record PERIOD

Its really amazing that Abeakakanda was able to fly around the field and never once hit the goal post Dovesett said PERIOD Hes a really great player and Im glad he was able to find the courage to beat my record Im really proud of him. dovesett held the former record of only flying into the field goal post  times in his career and only  times in one game PERIOD Abeakakandas record is almost unheard of in the pigeon ACC  also known as the Aviary Coast Conference PERIOD Hopefully Abeakakanda will continue this streak and take the Pittsburgh Pigeons all the way to the championships against other hopeful teams such as the Syracuse Songbirds Miami Mourning Doves or even the North Carolina Nightingales PERIOD

The botched snap by the Panthers leading to a touchdown by the Hokies might have made some fans cringe but it hurt the Pittsburgh Pigeons more PERIOD When the Panthers snapped the ball the birds hanging out near the end zone got scared and flew to the opposite end of the field giving the Virginia Tech Vultures better position on the field PERIOD

All in all the Pittsburgh Pigeons won the game but it came down to the wire PERIOD Just as the Virginia Tech Vultures swooped in to block a touchdown Kenny Pigeon flew a Hail Mary pass to Israel Abeakakanda  in pigeon football this means he threw a tab of an empty beer can that someone threw onto the field  and Abeakakanda swooped into the Pigeons end zone without hitting a field goal post and scored a touchdown PERIOD

Congratulations to the Pittsburgh Pigeons
