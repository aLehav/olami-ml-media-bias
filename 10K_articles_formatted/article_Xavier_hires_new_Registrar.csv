While Wawrzusin admits that everything may not be easy as a Registrar the job has been a rewarding one for her PERIOD

The biggest challenge of being a Registrar is balancing the roles of leader administrator and service provider Wawrzusin said PERIOD However one thing which can really describe Xavier University is excellence PERIOD So far everyone I have met from all areas of campus has shared a commitment to making Xavier University the best it can be. the Office of the Registrar has many more responsibilities outside of assisting students with their scheduling needs PERIOD

We are responsible for protecting the accuracy and integrity of academic records for posterity Wawrzusin said PERIOD We are also responsible for keeping our business practices and the student system uptodate as well as leading innovation in support of the academic mission of the university. dr PERIOD Wawrzusin spoke well of the challenges and implications of her job PERIOD
