Q Pertaining to relationships How do you know when you have had enough When is it time to call it quits

A Its hard to exit a relationship when you care about someone that goes for anyone PERIOD A good indicator to know youve had enough is questioning when its time to call it quits PERIOD A relationship between two people cant be onesided both you and your partner have to give the same effort in whatever way that may be PERIOD If this person doesnt make you happy anymore then it may be time to move on PERIOD Sometimes life doesnt give us the person we want or things dont go the way we want it to because life has something better to offer us down the road PERIOD That better thing could come tomorrow or in five years but the longer you keep making yourself unhappy the longer it will be until you find what you deserve PERIOD

Q I think one of my friends is stealing from me  not just Easy Mac PERIOD My clothes How do I confront her about this while trying to be respectful and keep our friendship

A If you arent sure if she is stealing your clothes or not the best thing to do is confront her in person and be straight up PERIOD Texting her about it may make you come off as passive aggressive PERIOD If you are lucky enough to have a lock on your door lock that shit up The best thing to do is ask her if shes seen any of your missing clothes you can always throw out a Have you been borrowing my clothes I cant find my gauchos and am worried about them Making it seem like you are more worried about where your clothes are rather than accusing her is a great way to be respectful to your friend PERIOD
