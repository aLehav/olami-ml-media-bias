The Cabin in the Woods is a rare movie falling in line with selfaware films like Shaun of the Dead Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and The Fifth Element films that simultaneously parody pay homage to and act as stunning examples of their genres PERIOD

The genre that Cabin tackles is horror PERIOD It takes the wellknown tropes and ideas of the genre and turns them around both making fun of making use of and twisting them inside out PERIOD The story follows five college students who go out to spend the weekend at a cabin in the woods PERIOD What they dont know is that the entire trip is being observed and manipulated by a mysterious group of controllers PERIOD And thats all Im going to reveal of the plot PERIOD

Cabin is built on taking the audiences preconceptions and thoroughly blending them with the unexpected PERIOD The tagline on the posters say it perfectly You think you know the story. this is one of the few movies that is much better to go into completely blind PERIOD Dont let anyone tell you anything about what happens PERIOD

Cabin marks the directorial debut for Drew Goddard who started his career writing episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel for Joss Whedon who produced and cowrote Cabin with Goddard PERIOD Whedon who also created Firefly and Doctor Horribles SingAlong Blog is famous for his rapier wit dialogue PERIOD He and Goddard heap it into the movie without restraint often putting some of the best lines in some of the most inappropriate moments which only makes them better PERIOD I havent laughed out loud at a movie this much in some time PERIOD

But just because Cabin has a healthy dose of verbal humor does not mean that it isnt a serious horror movie PERIOD Once the movie gains momentum it does not stop delivering and the setup makes even predictable events surprising which combined with Whedons propensity to defy what one is supposed to do leads to an extremely engaging cinematic experience PERIOD

On another level its a serious critique of what we love and what we dont about horror movies PERIOD I love being scared PERIOD I love that mixture of thrill of horror that objectification of wanting definitely for the people to be alright but at the same time hoping theyll go somewhere dark and face something awful PERIOD The things that I dont like are kids acting like idiots the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances PERIOD Drew Goddard and I both felt that the pendulum had swung a little too far in that direction. joss Whedon cowriter and coproducer of Cabin in the Woods
