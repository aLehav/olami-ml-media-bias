Published  November  

I was in Coffman Union one morning when I saw the most offensive sign Ive ever come across.At a table run by the Women of Virtue there was a message written on a whiteboardAre Eating Disorders a Sin

Eating disordersare recognized by both the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association as diseases.Diseases such as anorexia and bulimia are attributable to abnormal brain function and are related to other pathological brain conditions PERIOD

Eating disorders often occur concurrently with depression and it is because of this fact that I object so strongly to the Women of Virtues message.According to the Suicide Reference Library the risk of suicide is  times greater for a woman with anorexia nervosa than for a healthy woman of the same age and racial group PERIOD There are approximately  million American women with eating disorders PERIOD These women live every day trapped in a selfdestructive cycle that feeds them only shame and anger PERIOD Now we are going to tell them that this is their fault that there is no hope for them in this world or the next that they continually make a choice to turn away from God These women have no choices PERIOD Their choices have been stripped from them by disease and now we are condemning them By insisting that these women can control that we are telling them that they have the power to cure themselves PERIOD This is a dangerous message tantamount to telling someone with depression to cheer up. the selfhatred and anger that go handinhand with an eating disorder would be made intolerable by the inevitable failure PERIOD

Women who suffer from secret diseases suffer alone PERIOD Any one of us could be going home tonight to face this disease PERIOD The Women of Virtue are women of strong faith who believe that the message they are bringing is true PERIOD However the damage that could be caused to a mentally ill person by telling them that their illness is a sin could be irreparable PERIOD If there is not hope in this life and if by uncontrollable sin there is no hope in the next what is there leftWithout hope we have nothing.If our interest is in saving souls let us start with saving the minds and lives of the suffering among us PERIOD
