I guess those suffering with Black Hairy Tongue disease will not have a cure in sight with Chanels pumpkin patch ruined in FOXs latest episode of Scream Queens Pumpkin Patch. the episode managed to give audiences a bit more information however showrunner Ryan Murphy doesnt disappoint by giving viewers even more questions PERIOD

Last week left viewers with the one Scream Queen Zayday kidnapped by the Red Devil PERIOD Grace and Pete are still persisting that a search group goes out to find her PERIOD Dean Munsch ever so calmly shuts down the campus giving out a curfew to cancel Halloween PERIOD

Zayday wakes on a deep red cushion in a darkened room PERIOD Suddenly a trapdoor high above her opens and she discovers she is trapped in a basement hundreds of feet underground PERIOD The Red Devil appears holding a small white fluffy dog a la Silence of the Lambs. back at the Kappa house imaginary lunch is being served PERIOD Chanel  finally speaks up in a little more than a monotone hum declaring herself next in charge with Chanel in jail PERIOD Grace receives no help from the Kappa sisters in finding Zayday so she turns to her dad PERIOD This time the fatherdaughter standoff takes place not in his wicked scary film classroom but in his bedroom PERIOD Wes and Gigis salad date must have gone extremely well considering the fumbling going around to the sweet sounds of the 90s in his bed when Grace and Pete walk in PERIOD After the awkward aftermath of this encounter Grace and Pete finally gain allies in helping to find Zayday PERIOD

After gaining allies in Dean Munsch and Denise the group tries to figure out their plan of action PERIOD During this the audience hears a major clue PERIOD Gigi brings up intricate details about the land around the Shady house PERIOD The others brush it off as Gigi being her typical oddball character however I think this only intensifies Gigis part in the murderous spree PERIOD Grace remembers that smart phones have a GPS inside of them and they trace Zaydays phone to her location PERIOD

The GPS tracker takes them to a cellar a chatty old lady rents to whom we suspect is the Red Devil PERIOD Once inside the team splits up Gigi and Denise Grace Wes and Pete PERIOD Grace Wes and Pete come upon what seems like the Red Devils lair PERIOD In the room there is a long table with wine flowers and what looks like Oakland nachos PERIOD Below on the floor Grace trips over the handle to a trap door PERIOD She opens it and we see Zaydays room completely empty PERIOD During this time Gigi and Denise find what seems like a torture room PERIOD

Because nothing is ever simple with the Red Devil the lights go out PERIOD Through night vision goggles of the Red Devil the episode pays more homage to Silence of the Lambs. denise tries to save the day by tasing the suspect however she ends up tasing Gigi in the boob PERIOD Gigi finally tases the Red Devil and the lights come back on PERIOD Denise runs to find Grace Pete and Wes PERIOD She brings them back to the torture room where Gigi claims that the Red Devil hit her across the head with a baseball bat and left through a chute PERIOD Again a truly sketchy claim by Gigi that provokes an awkward stepmotherstepsister bond instead of suspicion PERIOD Denise points to the fact that it seems suspicious that Zayday is gone and so is the Red Devil PERIOD

Later in the night during Kappa presidential elections Zayday unexpectedly arrives PERIOD Zayday tells the tale of her Red Devil abduction and claims that the Red Devil released her from the basement and presented her with flowers and a meal of Oakland nachos PERIOD Discovering the Red Devil has a crush on her Zayday uses this to her advantage and escapes by stabbing his hand with a fork PERIOD Grace is relieved that Zayday is back while other Chanels seem to be skeptical PERIOD

In the final scenes of the episode Gigi is spotted walking in the dark PERIOD Following her is the Red Devil PERIOD The two meet up and Gigi gives order for another kill PERIOD It is now confirmed that Gigi is somehow involved in the Red Devil murders PERIOD

Even with the campus curfew Chanel still intends to open her pumpkin patch at  on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD Chanel  is baking in the kitchen showing us that she decided to stay even though she is being forced to wear a Mary Todd Lincoln costume for Halloween and is furious with Chanel PERIOD Hester comes along and swears to be a double agent persuading  to help her overthrow Chanel with the help of the candle crazy pledge Jennifer PERIOD After bribing her with hardly used expensive candles hidden in Chanels closet Jennifer agrees to throw the vote to Zayday PERIOD

Later the primary Chanel is arrested for the murder of Ms PERIOD Bean and is stuck in the prison because her father refuses to bail her out PERIOD At lunch Chanel finds Chaneloween fans among her fellow prison mates PERIOD Her prison stay is stopped short when Chanel  bails her out PERIOD Donning her signature killer shades Chanel swears revenge on Chanel  her suspect to who ratted her out PERIOD

Feeling down after her stay in the slammer Chanel begins the Kappa presidential vote before Grace and Zayday arrive PERIOD After Chanel opening declares she will swing the vote to win the voting begins PERIOD

Im predicting that Gigis participation in the Red Devil murder stems from a hatred of the Kappa House PERIOD Having to take care of the child Gigi blames Munsch and the Kappas PERIOD She plans to take them out one by one PERIOD I mean who actually believed the Red Devil hit her across the head with a baseball bat and got away when there was not even a scratch on her head

After discovering that the Red Devil has a thing for Zayday and the fact that other Dollar Scholars have been involved with the Red Devil Boone my new prediction for the person hiding behind the red suit is Earl Grey PERIOD We were introduced to his sudden interest in Zayday last episode but never saw him this episode PERIOD If he truly cares for Zayday wouldnt he be out helping Grace and Pete find her Instead he is nowhere to be found unless right in front of the viewers eyes as the Red Devil PERIOD
