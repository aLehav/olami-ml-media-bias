Gov PERIOD Sam Brownback plans to pass legislation that will change the way with which education in Kansas is dealt PERIOD While most people complain about the legislation bringing about radical changes to teachers I am far more concerned about the students PERIOD

Two major changes brought about with Brownbacks legislation include forcing eighth graders to create a career plan as well as offering to any high school a  incentive for each student who graduates with skills in specific laborbased industries PERIOD

By having high schools reach for that sweet money from the government they are coercing the schools into shifting their direction from an open and free system for students to one that will focus on more laborintensive studies PERIOD The classes offered at any high school will slowly shift away from the arts and humanities to those that deal with areas that are lacking such as the agricultural industry PERIOD

The far more damaging of these two sections however includes having the eighth graders create their own career plans for their future similar to what I have experienced in European nations PERIOD

I would be a fool if I were to expect each and every student to follow the career plans they create in eighth grade PERIOD By forcing the students to create a career plan the school puts an insanely large amount of pressure on its students PERIOD How would you feel if you had to choose your future in eighth grade Brownback is destroying the students dreams before they can materialize PERIOD

And the damage this bill would cause for liberal colleges would be apparent in about two years after being passed PERIOD The enrollment in liberal arts schools will drop significantly as high schools create more linear paths for their students PERIOD With some students already worried about the job market as it is just think of the inevitable chaos PERIOD Single russian women

This bill needs to die now and Brownback needs to learn this from those that it affects  everyone PERIOD
