Former Georgia player and current Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford.PhotoHenry Taylor

When the Los Angeles Rams traded quarterback Jared Goff firstround draft picks in  and  and a thirdround selection in  to Detroit for quarterback Matthew Stafford it was a move that signaled the franchise was allin on pursuing a championship with its current core PERIOD

Stafford was seen as the final piece to the puzzle and the only question left was how he would perform when the playoffs rolled around PERIOD

In Staffords first season with the Rams he had one of the best seasons of his career passing for  yards and  touchdowns with  interceptions PERIOD However questions remained about Staffords ability to perform in the postseason having only appeared in three playoff games over the course of  seasons with the Detroit Lions PERIOD

To bet on going from good to great at that positionAnd especially from where our team was our core group of players where they were in their career the coaching staff we have felt like it was just too good of an opportunity to pass up.Its a whole lot more fun when you gotta make a play like that to win the game and just steal somebodys soul Stafford said PERIOD Thats what it feels like sometimes where theyre sitting there going Man we just had this great comeback and you get to reach in there and take it from them PERIOD Thats a whole lot of fun. rams head coach Sean McVay has had high praise for Stafford throughout the  season and this week touched on his quarterbacks ability to lead with passion PERIOD

I think the quarterback position in general you got to be able to strike that balance of being evenkeeled but having the appropriate authentic emotion when its necessary McVay said PERIOD And hes got a great feel for that PERIOD And its always authentic. the Rams are now set to host the 49ers in the NFC championship game on Sunday a third matchup between the NFC West rivals this season PERIOD

If Stafford can lead the Rams to a victory hell make his first career Super Bowl appearance and become the first former Bulldog quarterback to start one since Fran Tarkenton started Super Bowl  for the Minnesota Vikings in  PERIOD

The perception of Staffords career would completely change if he helped the Rams win a Super Bowl title PERIOD A championship win would put Stafford in position to potentially earn a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame after his career ends whereas prior to this season that seemed highly unlikely PERIOD
