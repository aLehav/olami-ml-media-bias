Its widely known that clothes are an easy way to express oneself but lately a new styling necessity is stepping onto the scene nails PERIOD

Manicures are becoming more than just a pampering selfcare habit PERIOD Theyre taking over the fashion realm as a selfexpression staple PERIOD From little flowers to intricate glasswork nail art is becoming more popular than ever PERIOD

I get design manicures because having fun nails makes me happy said Jo Anna Valdez  PERIOD Whether it be for styling purposes or just a boost of serotonin nail art is infiltrating salons across the globe PERIOD

The takeover that this modern trend currently has on the world is reminiscent of the ancient world PERIOD Believe it or not it wasnt Instagram or TikTok that started nail artistry PERIOD

The Chinese are actually credited with inventing nail polish PERIOD In  BC these women soaked their nails in egg whites gelatine beeswax and dyes from flower petals in order to achieve a shiny nail with subtle hues of red and pink PERIOD These perfectly curated nails indicated wealth and social status PERIOD Back in  BC Egyptian mummies were laid with gold painted and hennatinted nails as discovered by archeologists PERIOD Jumping over to the Asian continent Indian women were found also flaunting hennapainted fingertips around the same time PERIOD Even ancient Babylonian men colored their nails with kohl before battle PERIOD

Now nail artistry is a bombing industry and has since been completely reimagined PERIOD With the addition of sculptural nails and otherworldly designs produced by artists like Mei Kawajiri and Sojin Oh nail art is limitless PERIOD What once depicted wealth social status and a warrior has now reached the likeness of modernday teens and adults PERIOD Still showcasing who they are this modern nail art portrays personality instead of status PERIOD

I think of nail art as a type of accessory said Anna Kallajian  PERIOD I wear very simple jewelry and tend to like simple nail art so I think in that way it helps show my personality the same way jewelry does. valdez added Nail art expresses my personality and who I am even on the days when Im wearing sweats. nail art has found its place in the fashion realm as a wearable accessory PERIOD Nail art is wearable art said Kallajian PERIOD

Nails are no longer overlooked PERIOD Rather theyve become an important piece in ones look PERIOD Nail art creates so much buzz around peoples fingertips that the press often highlights celebrities choice of nail color or design PERIOD Manicures even take over massive events like the Met Gala and nearly every award show with critics highlighting the best nails PERIOD

Nail art expresses the personality of those it adorns PERIOD
