In honor of Womens History Month were exploring some of the most iconic morally ambiguous female characters and examining why they continue to captivate audiences and inspire conversations about gender power and morality PERIOD

Medea the granddaughter of the sun god Helios experienced prominent interest in the feminist movement of the late twentieth century PERIOD She breaks the norm of a loving and nurturing mother by harming her children to seek justice and revenge for herself when her husband Jason leaves her to marry the wealthier princess of Corinth PERIOD While killing her children to punish Jason is morally reprehensible Medeas justice demonstrates her desire to retain her agency in the patriarchal society PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Douglas Bruster Professor of English and American Literature thinks that Medea was a radical work of its time because of how it treats gender and the complexity of human nature PERIOD

It is one of Euripedes strongest plots where the unthinkable happens  Mother deliberately sacrificing her own children which opens up the question of female passion justice and the role of anger in our lives Bruster said PERIOD

Essentially Medeas passion vengeance and commitment to justice make her memorable PERIOD While she is undeniably cruel her strength and resilience are admirable when she escapes from patriarchal oppression in Corinth PERIOD

Lady Macbeth comes across as someone who is ambitious and ruthless and she defies conventional morality when she convinces her husband to murder the king who was a guest at their home PERIOD Her ambition for power demonstrates her willingness to break traditional gender norms PERIOD She wants agency and control instead of being submissive to her husband PERIOD

English professor Dr PERIOD Eric Mallin elaborated on how Lady Macbeth may seem tough and ruthless but shes vulnerable inside and doesnt understand the implications of violence PERIOD

Theres one thing that Shakespeare is doing that you could argue is antifeminist is that women have all this power but they cant commit this kind of violence without it messing up their lives Dr PERIOD Mallin said referring to Lady Macbeths descent into madness PERIOD

Overall Lady Macbeths strength ambition ruthlessness and even weakness make her multidimensional and incredibly human PERIOD

Dany as her fans call her is considered by many to be the feminist icon in A Song of Ice of Fire and in the TV adaptation Game of Thrones. shes portrayed as a champion for justice and liberation working to free slaves and oppressed people PERIOD Dany is also a survivor of trauma and abuse at the hands of her brother having been sold into marriage as a young girl PERIOD Within this context Danys character is admirable she overcomes adversity is willing to be a great ruler and works to fulfill her dream of conquering Westeros PERIOD

However Danys actions demonstrate a darker side to her character PERIOD As she gains power and influence she is willing to use violence to achieve her goals exemplified by her crucifixion of slave masters PERIOD Her moral ambiguity stems from the tension between her desire to be a just and compassionate ruler and her willingness to employ harsh methods to maintain peace PERIOD

Complex and multifaceted women in fiction offer readers a glimpse into the duality of human nature and the challenges of making ethical decisions in a world thats not always black and white PERIOD By embracing morally ambiguous female characters we can broaden our perspectives on the female experience PERIOD
