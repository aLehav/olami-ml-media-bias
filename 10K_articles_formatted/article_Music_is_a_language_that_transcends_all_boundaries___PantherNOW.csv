Music is a universal language PERIOD Its a form of communication that transcends space and time touching the hearts of people worldwide PERIOD With just one note a shred of hope happiness and even sadness can be transmitted from one soul to the next PERIOD

Despite not being a musician music is an important factor in my life PERIOD Music evokes a sense of calmness during times of stress but it can also fuel my waves of rage and bring forth the tears Ive been holding back PERIOD

Music is just an expression said Kevin Gutt a former violinist and junior majoring in biomedical engineering PERIOD You get feelings that I feel you cant get anywhere else. like Gutt I believe that the sound or lyrics of a song can explain exactly what you are feeling inside during your highest and lowest points in life PERIOD

Music is the love and understanding that illuminates dark times and the serenity during great times PERIOD When words arent enough music helps you communicate unexplainable emotions PERIOD

Music is also a bridge between cultural heritages and different backgrounds PERIOD It erases the line that defines all borders and allows a group of distinct people feel the same thing at the same time PERIOD

For instance when a friend of mine started listening to Korean music or Kpop she would play it in her car all the time PERIOD Even though I didnt understand what the artist was singing I could tell if the song was romantic or upbeat and empowering PERIOD This demonstrates the universality of music because music reaches a profound level that can be understood by anyone PERIOD

You can totally relate to someone opposite to you just based on music taste said Gutt PERIOD You dont see the boundary at that moment youre just talking about music. gutt emphasizes the nonjudgmental nature of music PERIOD It doesnt discriminate between people who are different or not socially accepted PERIOD It affects whoever is present sending the message directly to the hearts and bones of every stranger PERIOD

Because music is such a personal experience people can feel so protective over the artist or genre of music they like PERIOD Due to this profound connection finding someone that understands that music as deeply as you do is a powerful moment PERIOD

The other beautiful aspect of music is that it can help with your individual development PERIOD Not only does music teach you a little bit more about yourself it also benefits the most powerful organ in your body PERIOD

Scientists found that music stimulates more parts of the brain than any other function in the human body according to NPR news PERIOD Its amazing how a song can allow us to experience everything we are in just two to three minutes PERIOD

Music especially in your early years you develop the skills the personal skills as a human being to shape what youre going to be as an adult Gutt said PERIOD

Music is a language that loops through every mind every person every group and every nation PERIOD It can settle internal struggles empower revolutions and most importantly hold up a mirror and show you who you are who you want to be and who you will be PERIOD
