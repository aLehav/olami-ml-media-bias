Remember Me



It was late summer in  PERIOD An opinion piece in a Long Island publication no longer in print by a man named Richard LHommedieu caught the eye of Stony Brook professor Norman Prusslin PERIOD

LHommedieu had just come from a trip to Georgia and visited the states music hall of fame while there PERIOD In his article he pondered about the possibility of one on Long Island and said he thought it was time the region had a music hall of fame of its own to recognize its great many talented performers PERIOD

Prusslin agreed PERIOD After emailing LHommedieu and introducing himself the two organized a meeting in the Deans suite in the Student Activities Center at Stony Brook University PERIOD Thetwo men invited people who they thought would be able to contribute to this organizationconcert promoters musicians an attorney a producer a writer PERIOD And the group of  or so sat to discuss what this idea could become PERIOD

Ten years later the Long Island Music Hall of Fame has become a nonprofit organization that has inducted such musicians as Louis Armstrong Cyndi Lauper LL Cool J Mariah Carey and Billy Joel it gives music students scholarships to help with their continuing education and is working to establish a museum of Long Island music history PERIOD

Prusslin says Stony Brook University was the only place the Hall of Fame could have begun due to its geographic location and the history of the late 1960s PERIOD

Back then not only was Suffolk County not as developed as it now is but Long Island was not as developed either in fact Nicolls Road did not go further south than Route  the Long Island Expressway did not go past exit  Route  and the large number of students at the university did not have nearly as much to do as they do now PERIOD

Because Stony Brook University is more than  miles from New York City one of the largest concert venues in the world it proved to be the perfect place for acts who were playing in the city to squeeze in one more show PERIOD Prusslin explained how one of the music industrys theories casually referred to as the  mile rule was the reason PERIOD

If youre playing a concert in some location you really cant play another one within  miles of it in the immediate time frame PERIOD Because then you have the two locations competing with one another he said PERIOD

So based on the distance from the city and the size and sheer number of venues the university had at the time famous acts would come to play three to five times per monththe Allman Brothers used to practice in Tabler Quad Bruce Springsteen played the Union Ballroom Jackson Brown played in the Union Auditorium U2 played in the Pritchard Gym the Red Hot Chili Peppers Blue Oyster Cult Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan also all played at the university PERIOD

All this music history and influence Prusslin said is the reason Stony Brook University was the ideal venue for the Long Island Music Hall of Fames founding PERIOD It now has grown to occupy a building in Port Jefferson and hosts its semiannual induction galas at grand locations PERIOD

Rebecca is a senior majoring in journalism and minoring in Middle Eastern studies PERIOD She joined The Statesman as a copy editor in her sophomore year after traveling to Turkana Kenya with members of that years editorial board and has enjoyed her time here ever since PERIOD She hopes to become either a business reporter or a foreign correspondent when she graduates PERIOD rebeccaanzel
