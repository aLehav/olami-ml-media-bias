Pitts Graduate School of Public Health would have shown Epidemic a video that Pitts Graduate School of Public Health would have shown Epidemic a video that simulates the outbreak of and response to infectious diseases if anyone had bothered to show up Thursday afternoon PERIOD

Maybe they were all home with the flu PERIOD

But Associate Dean for Student Affairs Sandra Quinn and Center for Public Health Practice project coordinator Molly Eggleston still had a lot to talk about PERIOD The issue of public health could never be more timely Quinn said as outbreaks of SARS and other contagions threaten the world PERIOD

The lack of an audience underscored Quinn and Egglestons assessment that public health is an issue that the public knows next to nothing about PERIOD

Differing from the medical field public health focuses on the prevention of conditions that allow diseases to spread rather than treating their symptoms PERIOD

We cant survive as a healthy world with just medical care which is where we put most of our resources Quinn said PERIOD

Seatbelts restaurant inspections and childhood immunizations are all products of public health policy recommendations PERIOD So even if they dont realize it people are affected by public health issues every day PERIOD

Quinn quoted former U.S PERIOD Surgeon General C PERIOD Everett Coop who said health care is vital to some of us some of the time public health is vital to all of us all of the time. public Health is a global issue Quinn continued PERIOD A disease can emerge from rural areas and spread around the world in hours. diseases dont recognize geopolitical boundaries Eggleston added referring to Chinas delay in reporting the SARS outbreak and how worldwide surveillance is needed for public health officials to contain such epidemics PERIOD We need a public health Interpol. with international concerns like SARS and bioterrorism the public health field is expanding at an incredible rate Eggleston explained PERIOD Its not as dramatic as the computer boom of the 90s but significant growth is seen in funding and the number of jobs that need to be filled PERIOD

Many of those jobs go unnoticed by the public jobs like EIS  standing for Epidemic Intelligence Service  officers often called virus hunters who were scouring emergency rooms across the country on Sept PERIOD   searching for symptoms of bioterrorism PERIOD These officers also conduct contact tracing as they try to backtrack infections all the way to the original source PERIOD

Developing countries give rise to the globalization of health problems Quinn said PERIOD Often where the natural environment is disturbed such as when a dam is built infectious diseases are released PERIOD

We thought we had things under control until things like HIV Ebola and SARS emerged over the last  years Quinn said PERIOD Viruses have jumped species from animal to human PERIOD What we face more and more is how do we communicate the risk without alarming people and in a situation that changes minute to minute

Eggleston described how discrimination occurs with new epidemics such as how restaurants in Chinatown in San Francisco for instance are reporting a drop in business following the SARS outbreak or how gays were regarded during the first few years of AIDS PERIOD

Its an unfortunate reaction arising from fear Eggleston said PERIOD Thats where public health comes in  to help people understand the facts and give them perspective. gSPH now offers an early admissions program to undergrads who can take graduatelevel classes in their senior year and finish them one year later instead of two PERIOD

And the GSPH also jumped up two places in the national standings to No PERIOD  out of  accredited schools of public health according to the U.S PERIOD News and World Report PERIOD It remains No PERIOD   and the No PERIOD  public college  for research funding from the National Institute of Health PERIOD
