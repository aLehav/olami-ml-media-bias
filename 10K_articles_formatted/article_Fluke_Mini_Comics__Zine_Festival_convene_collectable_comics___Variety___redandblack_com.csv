The Fluke MiniComics ad Zine Festival will take place at  Watt April  PERIOD

Correction appended PERIOD

An Athens tradition since  the Fluke MiniComics and Zine Festival started as just that  a fluke PERIOD

Put together by artist Todd Bak immediately post911 the convention provided a home for Southern artists after an exhibition was canceled in New York PERIOD

The first convention was held at the nowdefunct Tasty World with only a few artists displaying and about  guests in attendance this years convention boasts  exhibitors and expects  to  attendees PERIOD After the first year Bak turned the convention over to Athenian artists Robert Newsome and Patrick Dean who have run the convention for the past decade PERIOD While the show has swelled in size since its beginnings it retains its early sense of democratic exhibition PERIOD

The thing I like best about the show is that we dont focus on special guests or big names Dean said PERIOD The person paying  to sell minicomics gets exactly the same treatment as someone whos got a book out from a bigger publisher. the convention has become so popular its been forced to deny some exhibitors tables PERIOD

In the past people could basically just show up pay the fee and set up a table Newsome said PERIOD Weve actually had to open up preregistration this year  we have so much interest we cant fit everyone in. the convention boasts an eclectic group of exhibitors from local artists and crafts workers to exhibitors from midsize publishers such as Top Shelf and Oni PERIOD The convention has seen the early works of many upandcoming artists  Robert Venditti creator of The Surrogates and Andy Runton creator of popular childrens series Owly both exhibited some of their earliest work at the show PERIOD

One thing thats really nice about the show is giving students and firsttime exhibitors a place to show off their work Newsome said PERIOD

Many past artists have gone on to greater successes PERIOD

A lot of people who exhibited here  years ago are now working fulltime in the comics industry Dean said PERIOD

While the show is smaller than other Southern conventions such as Dragoncon or HeroesCon it makes up for it with a casual laidback vibe that engenders cooperation and friendliness rather than the usual scrabbling for sales PERIOD

Its a really friendly place Catie Donnelly a twoyear exhibitor from Atlanta said PERIOD A lot of shows you dont get the chance to socialize muchI met this great group of girls from SCAD last year I cant wait to see them again. the festival will have a diverse assortment of art on display from sliceoflife minicomics to scifi action and adventure pieces childrens stories and even local crafts PERIOD Some of the more wellknown artists exhibiting will be Chris Schweizer SCAD professor and creator of The Crogan Adventures Joey Weiser creator of Oni Presss Mermin the Merman and Chris Sims and Chad Bowers ComicsAlliance contributors and cofounders of Action Age Comics PERIOD While the festival attracts plenty of attention from around the Athens area Newsome hopes to see more participation from University of Georgia students PERIOD

We get a lot of students up here from SCAD because they have a fulltime sequential arts program Newsome said PERIOD We see a fair number of people that look like UGA students but without checking IDs we have no way to know for sure. newsome cites difficulties advertising on campus as a major reason few students know about the show PERIOD

Luckily the show keeps growing with or without students and Newsome and Dean hope to see more people than ever this year PERIOD

Every year is a surprise Newsome said PERIOD I have boxes full of great stuff I get every year  theres just so much great work coming out of the show. a full list of exhibitors is available at www.flukeisawesome.blogspot.com PERIOD
