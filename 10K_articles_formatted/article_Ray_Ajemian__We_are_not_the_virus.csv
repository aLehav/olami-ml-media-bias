March  marked the day the United States officiallysurpassed every other country in confirmed cases of COVID19 PERIOD That day alone over3000 people died globally pushing the total death count past  PERIOD And yet as thousands lose their lives every day I have seen onephrase circulate more than almost any other second only to wash your hands  we are the virus and coronavirus is the cure. beside insinuating that the deaths of COVID19 victims are a good thing and equating the deceased to parasites being incredibly cruel the statement is untrue PERIOD Most of the environmental improvements cited as proof that quarantine is healing the Earth actually have far simpler answers PERIOD The suddenly clear fishfilled Venice canals for instance arent due to any change in water quality its because there are no boats to kicksediment into the water when everybody is home PERIOD In some cases the lack of human activity is detrimental to animal life like the monkeys and deer in Asia who are now abruptly without their primary source of food tourists  and are now wandering hazardous cities in search of replacements PERIOD

There have been some real environmental benefits to the mass quarantines though particularly a decrease inair pollution PERIOD However coronavirusrelated changes in emissions are temporary and relatively small in scope PERIOD If anything the changes brought by COVID19 and the responses of our institutions show us just how little the average person is to blame for pollution PERIOD We are not the virus industrial capitalism is PERIOD

Take for instance the air pollution drop PERIOD The decrease in emissions inItaly andChina is because their factories have been shut down en masse not because people are driving less PERIOD Italy even continued to run public transportation as it was deemed an essential service and still saw these massiveemission decreases PERIOD Simply put it makes little difference that individuals arent getting in their cars when71 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from only a hundred companies PERIOD These corporations and the people who run them are the virus not the commuters and car owners PERIOD

Coronavirus will ultimately only make pollution worse as economic panic tempts governments to be even more permissive of corporate pollution PERIOD The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic has already called for Europe to forget about the Green Deal for the economys sake  his country happens to depend heavily on nuclear power and coal PERIOD Similarly President Donald Trump has pledged abailout for the airline industry saying theyll be number one in line all while airlines are on track to emit aquarter of the worlds maximum manageable amount of carbon carbon budget by  PERIOD

We know for a fact that human beings are not fundamentally harmful to the planet because weve been living here for hundreds of thousands of years PERIOD Indigenous people have been livingsustainably for as long as people have existed and they still are PERIOD Now with most of the world living industrially indigenous people care for80 percent of Earths biodiversity and  percent of its land despite being only  percent of the world population PERIOD Not only can human beings live without irreparably polluting the environment  we can live in ways that are beneficial to the planet despite what Western environmentalists might say PERIOD We just need to adopt these beneficial practices on a much larger scale and that means ending the harmful ones first PERIOD

To call industrial capitalism a virus is apt because it sickens and kills people like a virus PERIOD It isnt happenstance that the U.S PERIOD ranksfirst in infant mortality obesity and youth poverty and last in sanitation and access to water of all the worlds developed nations despite having thehighest GDP PERIOD Poverty and social inequality kill Americans as often as heart attacks and lung cancer with4. percent of U.S PERIOD deaths being traced back to poverty PERIOD This translates to  Americans who died in  a toll over  times larger than the total COVID19 death count by March  PERIOD These fatal issues in America have only gotten worse in the  years since  PERIOD

Coronavirus is set to combine with these already fatal issues in apocalyptic ways PERIOD The U.S. as of  has2. doctors per  people PERIOD Compare that to Italys . doctors per thousand as Italys hospitals areoverwhelmed with dying COVID19 patients PERIOD Make no mistakecapitalism will be the primary reason coronavirus kills Americans PERIOD A system built on masses of impoverished people selling their labor to a few business owners ensures that workers will work unless they are given another way to survive PERIOD Unsurprisingly the Families First Coronavirus Response Act neglects paid leave formillions PERIOD COVID19 belongs to a family of viruses weve known about for a long time but a vaccine doesnt exist yet  of course now it will takemonths before one will be developed PERIOD Still our government is already itching tolift shutdowns and social distancing rules so that businesses can operate and profit normally PERIOD Some officials have even saidimplicitly andexplicitly that the deaths caused by relaxing restrictions would be worth it for economic recovery PERIOD

As of March  COVID19 is projected to kill2. million Americans in total PERIOD This sort of death toll is neither normal nor necessary in China only3331 have reportedly died and the number of cases has started to stagnate although this number is disputed PERIOD Social distancing alone is not enough to save lives when some dont have the option and others have no health care to save them once they have it and yet even that bare minimum is falling by the wayside for the sake of profits PERIOD We can only hope that this will be the final case study against unfettered capitalism before we finally learn to care for each other and our planet PERIOD Weve all but passed the point of no return already PERIOD
