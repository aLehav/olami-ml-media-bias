Humanities Week returned from Oct PERIOD  to  with free online and inperson events around Virginia Techs campus PERIOD

Virginia Tech mens soccer fell to No PERIOD  North Carolina Wednesday night in the first round of the ACC tournament  a loss that puts the nail in the coffin on the Hokies season PERIOD

While most of spooky seasons special events have come to pass fall is far from over with plenty of fun festivities still in store for Hokies hoping to embrace all the season has to offer PERIOD Southwest Virginia hosts events and has natural beauty for students to enjoy with family friends or 

An open letter to President Sands

Search salaries of employees from Virginia Tech and other universities dating back to  PERIOD

Ithas gotten to the point where the race card seems inevitable PERIOD

But can you blame anyone for playing it The political advantage it offers is invaluable in crucial elections PERIOD The image of an egalitarian Democrat versus a sinister racist Republican surely pulls Independents to the left PERIOD There is just one problem That trick is becoming harder to perform PERIOD

Fewer people are racist than in the past and past and present racists are rightfully insulted and mocked by everyone else.Even so thats no reason to keep racial issues at the back of your mind when listening to politicians PERIOD The media and political opponents should investigate whether a candidate has racist views PERIOD No vote of mine is going to any racist candidate PERIOD But the insults hurled around today are way too general and unfounded PERIOD They are disproportionately aimed at Republican candidates PERIOD

Republicans and Tea Partiers have been consistently painted as fanatics and racists PERIOD However the most evil of Republicans George W PERIOD Bush appointed not one not two but three minorities to highlevel cabinet positions PERIOD

Alberto Gonzalez is still the highestranking Hispanic government official in United States history PERIOD Condoleezza Rice was the first black woman to serve as secretary of state PERIOD Colin Powell was the first black person to hold the office of Secretary of State PERIOD Granted these positions arent as sexy as being the first black president but a devout racist wouldnt appoint minorities to such crucial positions PERIOD Surely those appointments would at least make Bush critics hesitate to call him racist PERIOD Not a chance PERIOD Kanye West and many others labeled Bush a racist during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina PERIOD But things have changed PERIOD

The Republican Party named Michael Steele as its first black national party chairman PERIOD In  Republicans compensated for the inept Louisiana Governor Blancos term by electing Bobby Jindal the first Indian American governor in U.S PERIOD History PERIOD These are all great achievements but they cant compare to placing a minority in the countrys highest office.Today Herman Cain is campaigning to become the  presidential Republican candidate PERIOD He refers to himself as an American who is black rather than African American PERIOD For being a proud black man who flourished in the private sector he is thriving within that racist Tea Party PERIOD He has overwhelming support in Georgia a state that went to the old white guy in  and is considered one of the top five primary candidates PERIOD So surely now pundits would at least hesitate to call Tea Partiers and Republicans racists PERIOD Not so fast PERIOD One of the smartest most articulate of liberal pundits is seen through Cain and the Tea Partys deception PERIOD Janeane Garofalo has exposed the right wingers ploy in Keith Olbermanns showpodcastbasement PERIOD

She asserts that Cain is being used to deflect the racism that is inherent in the Republican Party Why would he do that Garofalo has an answer for that too PERIOD He either has a case of Stockholm syndrome she asserted the same of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas or he is being paid PERIOD

Cain responded by asserting that he found the comments pathetic and hilarious PERIOD He also claimed that whoever was supposed to pay him still owes him money PERIOD So if a black man running as a Republican cant shake off claims of racism within the conservative movement whats happening to the white guys and gals Rick Perry has already had one doozy of a racism accusation thrown at him PERIOD Ed Schultz who always looks like hes about to froth at the mouth caught Perry making a claim about a black cloud that hangs over America. schultz has proof PERIOD

Perry is on film saying those exact words PERIOD Schultz then sums his interpretation up for the audience  the black cloud that Perry is referring to must be President Barack Obama PERIOD But he ended the video early PERIOD The full clip shows the context of Perrys speech  trillion worth of debt PERIOD He says that big black cloud that hangs over America that debt that is so monstrous. even Jon Stewart thinks Schultzs smear is ridiculous PERIOD Stewart jokingly accuses Schultz of being a bigot by using such remarks as red herring and yellow lobster referring to an actual yellow lobster PERIOD But while Stewart is being satirical Schultz really is doing a disservice to

minorities PERIOD

I doubt he is a bigot but when Schultz pounces on Republicans for making statements that sound racist when taken out of context he is trivializing people who truly deal with racism in their lives PERIOD There are still a lot of racist politicians and somehow they get reelected PERIOD Instead of trying to discount a black Republican candidate or taking a speech out of context to make a politician seem racist the media should be concentrating on the facts PERIOD If there is real substantial evidence of racist remarks or actions from a politician the media must expose them PERIOD

But until convincing evidence of bigotry exists the media should focus on the candidates ideas and political records PERIOD Sarah Palins image was never tarnished by accusations of racism PERIOD She was however revealed to be horribly ignorant of crucial issues by journalists who challenged her qualifications PERIOD This type of journalism is necessary to help the public support the right candidates PERIOD

While Ed Schultz Janeane Garofalo and others are over analyzing small portions of speeches and drafting unsupportable conspiracy theories actual racists and other corrupt politicians are in office enjoying an absence of media attention PERIOD But calling a Republican a racist requires much less work and gets headlines PERIOD This pattern will continue until the average American watches Schultz babble nonsense gets bored and changes the channel PERIOD Then again most of us do that already PERIOD
