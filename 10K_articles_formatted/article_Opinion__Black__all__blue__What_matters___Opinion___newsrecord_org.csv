A few clouds PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Its an analogy widely disseminated by now Bob is at a dinner everyone gets a meal except for Bob PERIOD

Hungry Bob says Bob deserves food but the response from all the other wellfed attendees is everyone deserves food. and it has served as the perfect analogy for the Black Lives Matter movement and insidious response of all lives matter. it does not need to be stated that everyone deserves food or life and any other basic human right PERIOD

But when someone is completely denied the same access  like the metaphorical Bob for the centurieslong systematic oppression of black people including the countless names slain by police officers recently  the conversation isnt about everyone any more PERIOD

When the response to their struggle is saying everyone else deserves what they arent getting you arent being egalitarian you are blithely ignoring them because you dont like what they say PERIOD

Im yet to see someone protest the NFLs annual fall ensemble of pinkhued gear in honor of breast cancer awareness month PERIOD

Even on the hypersnarky internet nobody is callous enough to seriously say all cancers matters without trying to reach soulless troll status PERIOD

The newest twist on Black Lives Matter versus the all lives matter debate has been largely framed since the July  events in Dallas where five police were shot dead and another seven injured during a protest of the recent officerrelated deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile PERIOD

Ten days later three more officers were shot dead in Baton Rouge Louisiana with three more injured PERIOD

The newest response to Black Lives Matter has been that blue lives matter meaning police officers PERIOD What a fascinating development PERIOD

Singling out the plight of black people or Bob from earlier was some sort of affront to the colorblind postracial paradigm but blue lives matter is a perfectly acceptable response PERIOD

So was the issue with the word black

This summer at the Cincinnati Enquirer I interned at the realtime breaking news beat PERIOD

Talking to police officers was a daily occurrence as was being face to face with the brutal reality of daily deaths robberies and assaults PERIOD

I would never sully the extremely hard necessary and great work that men and women in uniform do keeping us safe PERIOD

However another brutal reality is the lack of accountability that officers face for their misdeeds PERIOD Michael Brown Eric Garner Tamir Rice and Freddie Gray were killed in officerrelated incidents that ended with no charges among many many others PERIOD

Former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing begins trial on Oct PERIOD  for murder charges in connection to the July  shooting death of Samuel DuBose PERIOD

The legal system will decide Tensings fate for a traffic stop in which the officer deemed the most aggressive at UCPD stopped DuBose and claimed he was dragging the officer with his vehicle PERIOD

That account appears to be easily debunked given Tensings body cam footage PERIOD Its an important step that Tensing was actually indicted and facing the most serious of charges PERIOD

But its equally important that two officers who corroborated Tensings false narrative Phillip Kidd and David Lindenschmidt face serious consequences for their behavior as do all officers sworn to protect and serve PERIOD

Nobody in their right mind ever tried to say all lives dont matter just that black ones do PERIOD

Nor did anyone say that the lives of the many many diligent and heroic officers around the nation dont matter PERIOD

This is all simply a matter of people dying for seemingly no reason with no repercussions PERIOD

Bob just wants dinner  and justice PERIOD
