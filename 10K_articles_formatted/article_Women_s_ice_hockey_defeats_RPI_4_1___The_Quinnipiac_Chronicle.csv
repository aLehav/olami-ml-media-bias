Kelly Babstock scored two goals in the final seven minutes of play to put the game out of reach for the Bobcats PERIOD Nicole Kosta and Brittany Lyons each added one for themselves as Quinnipiac womens ice hockey defeated RPI   by a final score of  on Friday evening PERIOD

It was maybe the most complete team effort since Ive been here Quinnipiac head coach Rick Seeley said PERIOD Top line to bottom line all  players. the Bobcats jumped out to an early  lead on a goal at the  mark from Nicole Kosta she received the puck from Kelly Babstock behind the net skated it around the back of the net and squeezed it in between the post and goaltender Kelly OBriens pad PERIOD

Quinnipiac   ECAC concluded the first period with  shots on goal PERIOD The Engineers OBrien turned aside all but one of the shots sent in her direction PERIOD Quinnipiac goalie Victoria Vigilante stopped all eight shots thrown at her in the first stanza PERIOD

OBrien made amends for the goal in the first period by withstanding a deluge of Bobcat scoring opportunities in the second PERIOD The Bobcats led by Nicole Brown more than doubled their scoring chances in the first period as they tested RPI with  shots on goal PERIOD

OBrien came within . seconds of recording a seamless second period PERIOD It would be Brown who led the charge with a teamhigh four shots in the period and she also proved to be the catalyst for the Bobcats scoring play in the final minute PERIOD

Brown from deep in her own end sent a pass to Amanda Colin at mid ice PERIOD Colin received the pass and streaked down the right side of the ice before zipping it in front of the net to a streaking Brittany Lyons PERIOD Lyons redirected the pass into the top left corner of the net giving the Bobcats a  lead as they headed into the final period PERIOD

With a goal from RPIs Lauren Wash just  into the third period the Engineers didnt let the Bobcats runaway with the game PERIOD

There were times when we gave them too much of a gap Seeley said when he was asked of the performance from his defense which only gave up  shots on the night PERIOD  Thats when things got a little desperate when they were attacking our zone PERIOD  I thought they had a great overall performance especially when things got desperate and they got a little tired PERIOD  I thought they recovered really well. it remained a  contest up until the final  of the game when Kelly Babstock who had been having a relatively quiet night on the score sheet took the reins PERIOD
She scored on a wrister over the glove of OBrien to increase Quinnipiacs lead to  PERIOD  It was the Bobcats third goal on their forty-first shot of the night PERIOD  About four minutes later she added another to make it  game PERIOD  It was her eighteenth goal of the season PERIOD

Quinnipiac had a  advantage in shots on goal PERIOD  It is the fourth straight game in which they have outshot their opponent by at least  PERIOD  However against UNH and Boston College they were unable to convert those opportunities into goals PERIOD
