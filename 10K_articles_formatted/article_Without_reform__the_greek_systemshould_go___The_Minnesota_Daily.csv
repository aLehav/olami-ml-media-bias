If I were to create a Top Ten List of things I have a strong distaste for three things that would appear at the top of my list are drugs especially alcohol and tobacco violence particularly sexual violence and silence or the refusal to communicate PERIOD When these vices are perpetrated by institutions my blood boils PERIOD This is because we are a society that hesitates  refuses  to hold institutions accountable not only for wrongdoing but also for fostering an environment where people find encouragement and coercion to embrace destructive attitudes and behaviors PERIOD
The greek system most notably the fraternal portion is an institution with insufficient measures in place to deter the abuse of alcohol and drugs and the perpetration of violence specifically sexual violence by its members and their allies PERIOD University systems in conjunction with the greek system perpetrate the third aforementioned vice by ignoring these issues or downplaying their importance and impact in the University community PERIOD Therefore the greek system and the University alike can be found guilty of fostering destructive oppressive environments PERIOD The University should be required to make changes in policy or be forced to eliminate the greek system from the University community PERIOD
We can begin our examination of the problematic nature of the greek system with a look at alcohol abuse PERIOD The results of a  survey of more than  students at  fouryear colleges in  states show that  percent of students who lived in fraternity houses were binge drinkers PERIOD This means that they had consumed at least five or more drinks at a time in the twoweek period prior to being surveyed PERIOD In comparison  percent of male students overall were classified as binge drinkers PERIOD Another finding reveals that students living in greeksystem housing drink three times the number of drinks as the average student PERIOD
At the University of Minnesota the fraternity and sorority houses are on property that is not owned by the University PERIOD These houses do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Universitys alcohol policies which are unclear and easily bypassed PERIOD Sororities prohibit alcohol from their premises for insurance purposes while fraternities under different insurance regulations are not required to attain a permit by the University to sell alcohol at parties PERIOD In fact University policy prohibits the sale of alcohol on its premises PERIOD Fraternities with the special privilege of separate land ownership and all the benefits of being immersed in the University gain financially from the sale of alcohol quite often to minors PERIOD
It would be difficult to discuss sexual violence on campus and in the greek system without studying the role of alcohol PERIOD Studies have shown that on college campuses  percent of reported rapes involve the consumption of alcohol or some other drug and  percent of rapes are perpetrated by someone the victim knows PERIOD
Although alcohol itself should not be blamed for the occurrence of acquaintance or date rape it must be recognized as a relevant factor PERIOD A quick informal study of a fraternity party reveals several conditions that make sexual assault highly possible PERIOD Men and women are together in a festive mood and a sexuallycharged setting PERIOD The presence of alcohol in the mix increases male aggression and sexual desire while simultaneously causing a breakdown in judgment and the ability to communicate effectively PERIOD Throw in fraternal peer pressure to score and what develops is a situation that promotes rape and rape culture PERIOD
Of course alcohol abuse and sexual violence do not occur in a social vacuum PERIOD Nor do they occur solely in the greek system PERIOD Athletics and ROTC are other programs that have been targeted as havens of destructive attitudes and behaviors PERIOD Residence halls where young men and women test the waters of social independence for the first time also have a responsibility to promote healthy lifestyles PERIOD
There are many other issues beyond alcohol and sexual violence that foster a desire for change in the greek system PERIOD Some of these are ingroup superiority ostracism the social elitism attributed to membership misogyny in fraternities and the privilege that can be attained with the pocketbooks of alumni PERIOD These factors are cause for policy development that can make the greek system more proactive in promoting healthy living among its members and more accountable for members actions PERIOD
The final responsibility then lies with the University to break its silence on the issues facing the greek system PERIOD As a single fraternity brother or sister is within the institution of the greek system so is the individual institution of the Universitys greek system is within the larger institution of the University PERIOD Therefore it is the Universitys responsibility and our responsibility as its constituents to speak out against destructive behavior and attitudes and to create an atmosphere that fosters respect and responsibility toward ourselves and each other PERIOD
If change is not brought about in a collaborative effort by the greek system or in University offices that are able to adjust policies on alcohol and sexual violence then I favor the termination of the greek system and an investigation into the shortcomings of University policy as a consequence PERIOD
Emmanuel Ortiz is a junior in the College of Liberal Arts PERIOD He is cofounder and chair of Men Against Rape and Sexisma former coordinator of the Peer Education Program at the Program Against Sexual Violence and a member of the Universitys Alcohol and Tobacco and Other Drug Policy Review Committee PERIOD
