Immersive. its the industry buzzword for virtual reality VR PERIOD

The nerd world has debated the viability of VR to death since the first Oculus Rift preorders shipped on March  PERIOD

Questions about how well it works whether all games can really benefit from a VR treatment and even online harassment have been discussed in the news PERIOD

Yet Im thinking back to the buzzword immersive and to my horror Im wondering if full immersion is right for me PERIOD

The Rift and all the other various VR headsets out there are chock full of sensors and gadgets to give players an immersive gaming experience PERIOD

The Oculus Rift and VR headsets in general sound super cool PERIOD

What could be better than feeling like Im really slaying a dragon as I gallop through the snow laden land of Skyrim

Controlling Lara Croft as if I am Lara Croft as she raids some tombs That sounds awesome PERIOD

Except that the Dragonborn goes through some scary shit PERIOD

Hear me out hereIm not kidding I really do think adventure games can get terrifying PERIOD

Personally Im a big scaredycat so even adventure games can scare me out of my seat PERIOD

Sometimes looking away from the screen and screeching into a pillow like a hawk is the only way I can continue to keep searching for Ciri or survive the hordes of Flood infected aliens coming at me PERIOD

I dont even try to play horror games my fight or flight system kicks into gear and Im running away before you can say Wanna play Amnesia

The idea of having my face literally strapped into a screen trapped while skeletons and zombies sneak up behind me while I mine for diamonds is mildly horrifying PERIOD

Yes I get scared playing Minecraft too PERIOD

My palms are sweating at the thought of having to go through Ravenholm in virtual reality PERIOD WE DONT GO TO RAVENHOLM IN VR

At the same time the idea of feeling like Im really cruising through space behind the stick of a sweet starship or standing at the edge of a magnificent fantasy vista is highly appealing PERIOD

Its disappointing to think that I like those who get motion sickness from VR may have to stay away from VR games PERIOD Even more disappointing when I think that Ill have to stay away because of the very nature of VRthe immersion

Anxiety and fear can hit gamers even without being immersed in VR so is it going to get worse the more immersive games get

If VR truly is the future of video games then I and the rest of the gamers out there with anxiety or fears will be left out in the cold PERIOD
