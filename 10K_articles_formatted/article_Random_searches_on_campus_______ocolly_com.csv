A great debate that has arisen as a direct result of terrorist actions around the globe is the practice of random searches PERIOD Now the debate has come closer to home with a newlyenacted campus security policy PERIOD



In what has been called a  to their registration status several homes of international students have been searched by FBI agents PERIOD International students may be subject to further searches PERIOD



Under the National Security EntryExit Registration System NSEERS foreign nationals are required to present several forms of information and identification PERIOD They are asked for documents like a proof of lease student visas passports proof of enrollment and several other papers PERIOD



Even if there is a chance of averting a terror attack is this really a policy that our countrys founders had in mind Of course the drafters of the Bill of Rights could never have anticipated the recent international climate or the increasingly dangerous world we live in today PERIOD



After the Sept PERIOD  attacks and the ensuing investigations it became evident that terrorists had received training used in terrorist actions in several American universities PERIOD One hijacker even received flight training at the University of Oklahoma PERIOD



But are these measures justified How can intent to use a college education for terrorist purposes be proven These are questions that need to be asked before we demand too much more out of our international students the vast majority of whom love this country very much and would wish its people no harm PERIOD



Of course if we searched everyone we would find some incriminating evidence sooner or later PERIOD But is that really the America we want to call our own We all want to feel safer but random searches which are probably not all that random should take a back seat to real police work rather than racial profiling PERIOD We can be a safer country without sacrificing our freedoms that so many have fought and died to preserve PERIOD
