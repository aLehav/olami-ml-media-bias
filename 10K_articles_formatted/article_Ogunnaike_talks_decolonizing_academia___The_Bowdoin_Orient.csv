Oludamini Ogunnaike an assistant professor of African religious thought at the University of Virginia UVA visited Bowdoin on Monday to deliver a lecture entitled From Heathen to Subhuman Religion Race and the Academic Disciplines. oludamini Ogunnaike spoke about the development of modern Western racism and the implications of colonial power structures for academics today PERIOD

Oludamini Ogunnaike was brought to the College in part by his brother Bowdoins own Assistant Professor of Africana Studies Ayodeji Ogunnaike PERIOD Before the talk began Ayodeji Ogunnaike prefaced the lecture by explaining that the research had grown out of a term paper his brother completed during his first year of graduate school over the course of two long nights in Ayodeji Ogunnaikes undergraduate dorm room PERIOD

Oludamini Ogunnaike began by showing several clips to highlight how Western racism functions today PERIOD One clip showed European Union High Representative Josep Borrel referring to Europe as a garden and the rest of the world as a jungle. so the question is how did we get here he asked to frame the rest of the talk PERIOD Most people will be like Oh thats horrific PERIOD Thats terrible PERIOD You shouldnt say that out loud  But in many ways these guys are just saying the quiet part out loud right

Oludamini Ogunnaike explained that these racist ways of thinking originate from the Great Chain of Being a medieval way of ranking the value of the worlds living things based on their proximity to God and the divine PERIOD

This might seem like a funny or weird idea today but I mean think about it PERIOD If a dog gets hit by a car we cry right If you run over a roach nobody cries. so we see some forms of life as being more valuable than others Oludamini Ogunnaike said PERIOD

Although the Great Chain of Being began as a way of categorizing all living things Oludamini Ogunnaike explained that it eventually transformed into a way of measuring the value of humans against other humans PERIOD

They put the Chain down flipped it and reversed it Oludamini Ogunnaike said PERIOD And so in the past Africans and Native Americans are kind of the back of the bus of progress and Western Europeans are at the front leading the charge. oludamini Ogunnaike modeled how the West continues to be applied as the standard for human excellence on all levels PERIOD

This stuff is not dead by any stretch of the imagination Oludamini Ogunnaike said PERIOD Its produced this whole genre of literature of What went wrongWhy didnt the Muslim world become like the Western Why didnt China develop like the Western world So Western civilization is just civilization PERIOD The Western academy just becomes the academy PERIOD Western philosophy is just philosophy PERIOD Western education is just education. oludamini Ogunnaike highlighted religious studies as one place where the walls of the Western academy are broken down PERIOD

Religious studies is one of those few places where nonWestern intellectual traditions are studied in any kind of depth where people get the languages and the experience necessary to become semifluent in these traditions Oludamini Ogunnaike said PERIOD

During the QA session following the lecture students asked Oludamini Ogunnaike about solutions to breaking Westerncentric patterns of thinking in academics PERIOD Oludamini Ogunnaike put forth small yet tangible steps for students to take such as creating reading groups focused on postcolonial texts or lobbying the College for shifts in curricula PERIOD

The tools that Oludamini Ogunnaike suggested left attendees like Lia Kornmehl  feeling optimistic for the future of academia PERIOD

Obviously we cant dismantle all of these structures alone or in one day but having some tools to start doing that work in classrooms and in privileged institutions like Bowdoin is really powerful Kornmehl said PERIOD
