Tiger Stadium is sealed on Jan PERIOD   as security measures heighten in response to recent vandalizing PERIOD

Five breakins in five weeks isnt the kind of record Tiger Stadium wants to be known for PERIOD With recent incidents occurring throughout January and into early February the question is whether more should be done to deter criminal activity in the stadium PERIOD

Trespassing in college football stadiums is not an unusual crime PERIOD Stadiums around the country at various universities can typically experience these incidents periodically PERIOD However University of Florida Police Department spokesperson Major Brad Barber said breakins are not a frequent occurrence at the universitys stadium PERIOD

Weve encountered individuals on the field late at night early in the morning periodically over the years Barber said PERIOD But nothing substantial by any stretch of the imagination. one reason for this could be UFs open stadium policy PERIOD Barber said Ben Hill Griffin Stadium popularly known as The Swamp is open to the public seven days a week PERIOD

Excluding football season the entire stadiums bleacher section can be accessed from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD every day PERIOD Barber said the open access is greatly used by students and faculty alike PERIOD

It is used extensively by students staff faculty and visitors Barber said PERIOD They come and exercise within the stadium itself. the field is still off limits to unauthorized personnel during operating hours Barber said PERIOD And after  p.m PERIOD each day the stadium is secured PERIOD But the stadium isnt simply locked and left alone PERIOD After hours it is under increased surveillance by university police and athletic personnel PERIOD

We operate with increased patrols around the stadium PERIOD And there are staff from the university athletic association that actually are housed within the stadium Barber said PERIOD They live there in an apartment thats there in the stadium PERIOD And they conduct periodic checks through the evening. at the University of Michigan UMPD spokesperson Diane Brown said the universitys football stadium Michigan Stadium encounters frequent breakins PERIOD The incidents have always been present Brown said as Michigan Stadium is a high profile venue like Tiger Stadium PERIOD

That hasnt particularly changed an awful a lot over the years PERIOD It still is kind of an activity that occurs fairly frequently Brown said PERIOD

Similar to Tiger Stadiums  holding capacity UMichs stadium nicknamed The Big House holds  people PERIOD Comparable to LSUs breakin incidents Brown said most of Michigan Stadiums trespassing incidents are attempted by students or others trying to sneak in for a quick glance and maybe a picture or two PERIOD

Its not uncommon for us to have illegal entry where students and others are climbing over the fence to go in and take pictures and stuff Brown said PERIOD Theyre usually not going in to do any harm. similar to UFs current stadium policy UMichs stadium also used to be open to the public Brown said PERIOD That policy however was eventually changed for security purposes PERIOD

It needed to be done Brown said PERIOD Its a high profile location. having an open stadium policy like at UF isnt the solution to ending all activity around a universitys football stadium PERIOD In  a person climbed a fence at UFs Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and jumped to his death according to The Gainesville Sun PERIOD

The suicide along with a rape incident in a stadium bathroom in  raised questions to whether the stadium should remain open The Gainesville Sun said PERIOD

The Gainesville Sun also reported that UFPD Capt PERIOD Darren Baxley said that policies involving the stadium were being evaluated but such incidents can happen anywhere PERIOD

I dont believe that the stadium is less safe than anywhere else Baxley told The Gainesville Sun PERIOD It does present a unique challenge to secure a facility that large and it gives an opportunity for people to do something that isnt good but that can be said for a lot of different areas around Gainesville. lou Marciani director of The National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security at The University of Southern Mississippi said Tiger Stadium could potentially benefit from what the center calls an environmental design assessment. the assessment involves evaluating the exterior security system and proposing what upgrades could be made to deter future trespassers PERIOD Marciani said that proper fencing lighting and signage are among the main areas that a university can focus on to reduce criminal activity at a specific venue PERIOD

LSUPD arrested students Michael Freetage Travis Lecompte and Jacob Phillips for simple burglary at Tiger Stadium according to Media Relation

Six breakins occurred at Tiger Stadiumlast spring but there has only been one so far in  PERIOD After a year of implementing new security fea
