9002,2023-02-09,"why is it so hard to stand up for black folk Why is it so courageous Why is there so much risk involved in speaking out against injustice

These are the questions that the Rev PERIOD Dr PERIOD Andre E PERIOD Johnson asked Loyola on April  at the lecture White Silence and The Making of WhiteChurchQuiet. johnson founded the hashtag in  in response to the white Churchs silence on police brutality PERIOD

The talk sponsored by Messina and CCSJ called audience members to have empathy for and awareness about these issues PERIOD

We should all care when innocent people are being targeted when innocent people are being killed Jean Lee Cole Ph.D. said in her introduction to the talk PERIOD Cole is the inaugural faculty director of communityengaged learning and scholarship and helped bring Johnson to campus PERIOD

Johnson helped to frame this cry for empathy in light of race relations in the United States and in relationship to the Christian Church PERIOD As he has observed if there is any type of Christian response in the aftermath in one of these events it is from the black Church PERIOD

The story of Jesus is someone being set up by the State PERIOD They thought they were getting rid of a bad dude PERIOD His death was nothing special they had two other guys there at the same time Johnson said PERIOD This is relatable to the black community and the black struggle PERIOD Its one of the reasons why we have the tradition of social justice of liberation in the black Church. but where is the white Church Why arent white Church leaders speaking out

Johnson cited recent research that states that while over  percent of black Christians believe that police brutality is part of the picture of race about the same number of white Christians believe the opposite that police killings are isolated incidents PERIOD

If you already come to the table not believing my truth how can we really get things accomplished Johnson said PERIOD

Johnson often referred to Robin DiAngelos idea of white fragility as an explanation for the Churchs silence PERIOD White fragility is the idea that even a minimal amount of racial stress becomes intolerable he said PERIOD

White fragility is responsible for the cry of All Lives Matter in response to Black Lives Matter. this reaction often tells me something about who you think black people are Johnson said PERIOD

Johnson also referred to the Department of Justices report on the Baltimore Police Department after the death of Freddie Grey PERIOD The testimonies and stories offered in the report are ones that are shared by countless African Americans across the country he said PERIOD

To Johnson the report is also a sign that there is a problem PERIOD

Does the white Church believe black truth Do you see me as human Johnson said PERIOD How many times do you have to hear the same stories over and over and over and over and over and over again before it beings to resonate as true

And yet Johnson understands white Church leaders silence speaking out means risking ones job and career friends and family PERIOD

To admit police brutality is part of the picture of race in America damages their idea of America it causes them to reexamine what they think of black people in the first place he said PERIOD

Johnson may understand the roots of the silence but by no means does he justify it PERIOD To have the evidence right in front of us and to still not be empathetic is problematic he said PERIOD And thats the nice way to put it. johnson ended his discussion by reviewing Loyolas Mission Statement PERIOD The statement makes it clear that all human beings are made in the image of God and that everyone is a child of God PERIOD

If thats true then if Im seeing black bodies laying on the ground I can be empathetic because thats my brother or my sister laying dead on the street he said PERIOD Thats all we need. to catch up on the discussion view WhiteChurchQuiet and ActivismLoy where students livetweeted the lecture as well as some of the class discussions in which Johnson participated PERIOD
