The City Council will be having two separate public hearings about the Americans with Disabilities Act and making sure buildings are following codes PERIOD



The presentations will take place at  p.m PERIOD and  p.m PERIOD at City Hall Tuesday PERIOD

Mayor John Inyart said the ADA often assesses public buildings to make sure they are up to date with the ADA standards PERIOD

We had a company come in and do an ADA assessment of all our buildings Inyart said PERIOD As a part of the public requirement for this process we have to have a public hearing to let people know what they have found. he said the council might start adopting policies for the sites that need to be worked on PERIOD

This is a longrange process to make sure all of our facilities are ADA compliant Inyart said PERIOD Its more than just wheelchair accessibilityits a lot of stuff. the council will be evaluating policies after the evaluation at its regular meeting at  p.m PERIOD

Part of the evaluation process with this company is the evaluation of our policies Inyart said PERIOD One of the first things that has to be done is we have to have a hard and fast policy that talks about how we will deal with any accessibility issues. inyart said this policy will not physically change the buildings but details how the staff addresses and reacts to concerns about accessibility PERIOD

This is just a roadmap through the rest of the process Inyart said PERIOD

The council will also be looking at alternative naturalgas suppliers PERIOD

Once a year we have a small window of opportunity to contract with a supplier of natural gas Inyart said PERIOD We will be changing to a company called CenterPoint Energy Services Inc.

Inyart said they will be voting to amend the terms of the agreement with Ameren to allow the city to go to another company for natural gas PERIOD

They have to approve this before they can vote to approve the agreement on a contract with CenterPoint PERIOD

Inyart said this allows competition of the cost of natural gas PERIOD

It allows us to bid out that amount of natural gas we are expected to use and get a better rate Inyart said PERIOD It saves the taxpayers money to do this. this bid could save the city more than  he said PERIOD

The council will also discuss the bid to a company to repave State Street north of the city limits PERIOD Inyart said they are waiting to see the bid and based on recommendations by the staff they might be prepared to vote on one PERIOD
