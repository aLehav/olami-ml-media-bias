Iowa pitcher Cole McDonald throw a pitch during a baseball game between Iowa and CalState Northridge at Duane Banks Field on Saturday March   PERIOD The Hawkeyes dropped their home opener to the Matadors  PERIOD

Pete Ruden Sports Editor April  

Heading into its second road series of the Big Ten season Iowa baseball needs solid production in an area that has been a strength at times this season pitching PERIOD

The Hawkeyes are coming off a  loss at Bradley on Wednesday in which they used eight different arms PERIOD While the performance wasnt terrible  Iowa only gave up  runs on  hits  the Hawkeyes tendency to allow base runners caused problems PERIOD

For the most part the pitchers that we ran out there did a really nice job Iowa head coach Rick Heller said in a release PERIOD They fought and battled PERIOD Some guys who needed to get out there and get some confidence did a good job PERIOD The plan worked well if we would have just executed both on offense and defense but we did not. trenton Wallace started on the bump and the Hawkeyes didnt allow a hit until Jason Foster  Iowas fourth pitcher of the game  entered from the bullpen PERIOD

Then Iowa gave up  runs in the next . innings conceding  hits and  walks in the process PERIOD

You have to keep your free bases to a minimum and we had too many Heller said in a release PERIOD Two of their  runs were walks PERIOD We made some mistakes defensively. luckily for Iowa Purdue is not a strong offensive team giving the Hawkeye pitching staff an ample opportunity to bounce back PERIOD

The Boilermakers are hitting just . as a team last in the Big Ten PERIOD While center fielder Skyler Hunter comes at . his team doesnt follow suit PERIOD

Purdue hasnt displayed much power this season either clubbing only  home runs on the season PERIOD

RELATED Bats wanted in loss to Bradley

Iowas weekend rotation of Cole McDonald Cam Baumann and Grant Judkins will enter the series trying to give the Hawkeyes their third conference series win in a row PERIOD

As it has the last two weekends it will be important for McDonald to come out strong in the opener PERIOD

After a rocky start to the season McDonald has settled down allowing  runs in his last two starts  a total of . innings PERIOD

Judkins Iowas Sunday starter has been strong all season boasting a . eRA with an opponents batting average of . pERIOD

If McDonald and Baumann get off to a fast start it will make it easier for Judkins to attack the hitters he faces in the series finale PERIOD

It gives me confidence going out there seeing what theyve done seeing how theyve pitched different batters Judkins said after Iowa swept Illinois on March  PERIOD

The Hawkeyes will also be presented with the chance to get their bats going again Purdues starting rotation includes Andrew Bohm and Ryan Beard who are both  with ERAs above . pERIOD Both of those pitchers also have an opponents batting average over . pERIOD

The room for improvement is there but with the Hawkeyes embarking on a road trip against a team one spot behind in the Big Ten standings Iowa has a chance to gain some ground and climb the conference standings PERIOD
