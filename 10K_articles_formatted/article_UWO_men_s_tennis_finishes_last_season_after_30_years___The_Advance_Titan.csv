9202,2023-11-01,"the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh said goodbye to the mens soccer program earlier this school year after it was announced in spring of  that it was being cut PERIOD

It is now time for UWO to say farewell to the mens tennis program as well PERIOD

Junior Austin Laumb transferred to Oshkosh to play tennis after spending his freshman year of college at a small private school in Minnesota PERIOD He said he has no regrets when it comes to switching to be a Titan and he will miss playing more than anything PERIOD

Well its definitely an honor to play for UWO and its been the experience of a lifetime Laumb said PERIOD Playing on this team has been the best time of my life and has given me memories I will never forget PERIOD I met some of my best friends on the team our team is incredibly close and Ive met some of the best people in my life through tennis. when Chancellor Andrew Leavitt and Athletic Director Darryl Sims announced the two programs would be phased out after this school year they said it was due to budget cuts PERIOD However mens tennis head coach James Lewison said he could not find logic in this reasoning PERIOD

I truly believe the reason for cutting the program was out of total lack of care for the program and I think the Oshkosh community deserves to stop hearing about budget issues when the money from our program will be going to other more popular programs Lewison said PERIOD A good example to show the disinterest by the chancellor and athletic department was that my group of guys wasnt even invited to the athletics meetandgreet in September PERIOD Wouldnt you think that if the athletic department empathized with the tennis players they would have invited my team to the event There have been other instances similar to that where the team has not been included PERIOD But maybe the chancellor and athletic department are just trying to practice not having the team next year

This is not the first time the administration has threatened to cut the mens tennis program PERIOD Steven Francour the head coach of both mens and womens tennis at Oshkosh from  to  and a previous tennis player at the University said the same thing happened back in  PERIOD

We had a meeting with Elliott Garb the assistant chancellor at the time and he told us due to budget concerns that tennis would be cut along with wrestling Francour said PERIOD There was a lot of backlash so they reversed the decision. unlike many other sports at UWO including both the softball and baseball teams who traveled to Florida the mens tennis program was not given any money by the athletic department to travel on a spring break trip in March Lewison said earlier this year PERIOD According to Lewison he and his players were especially frustrated with the situation given the circumstances of the longevity of the team PERIOD

UW Oshkoshs Assistant Vice Chancellor Jamie Ceman stated the mens tennis team spends  each year PERIOD This amount of money equates to . percent of the total athletic department budget which consists of  PERIOD

Tennis players and Lewison said they have been told the  will not be expired after this season PERIOD Rather they have been informed the money will instead be added to other sports funds PERIOD

Francour said the actual amount of money that will be saved from cutting the team is insignificant PERIOD

Its like having a penny in your pocket and that penny falling on the ground Francour said PERIOD It has no consequential value. francour also pointed out how other UW System schools have not made drastic changes the way UWO has since Scott Walker cut UW budgets in  PERIOD

The whole state system is under the same budget Francour said PERIOD Yet no other school to date has dropped a sport PERIOD Its disappointing to think they could not have come up with a solution. the mens tennis team learned about their fate during the  tennis season when Daniel Bickett was still their coach PERIOD Bickett was the coach at UWO during the  season before accepting a position at UWGreen Bay PERIOD

Sophomore David Leffler explained Sims was the first person to tell the team it was being cut PERIOD

Coach Bickett came up to us after practice one day and was like Hey we have a meeting with Darryl Leffler said PERIOD And we thought we were in trouble for something PERIOD We walk in there and Sims immediately was like Guys Im sorry but your program is getting cut. i had no clue PERIOD I was so mad at that moment PERIOD It sucked. leffler went on to list the reasons Sims gave for why the tennis team would not be able to compete following the  school year PERIOD

He said it was budget reasons from the . million dollar budget cut from Scott Walker Leffler said PERIOD But then to find out that its really going back into the athletic program probably hurt the most knowing that Sims kind of lied to us right there PERIOD He just tossed up a bunch of different numbers saying what our budget was PERIOD It was just a whole mess of information. since then the team has been given other reasons for the cut like not being in a conference and Title IX PERIOD
Players and Lewison agree the lack of communication between them and administration has made this transition harder and more hurtful than necessary PERIOD

Mark Gorski the father of sophomore Vincent Gorski said from a parents perspective the University is not taking advantage of a situation that could teach his son and other athletes valuable characteristics for the future PERIOD

Each day my employees look to me to make good decisions that provide security and future growth for the company and employees Mark said PERIOD Our leadership team bases our decisionmaking on the company mission PERIOD The UWO leadership team is failing and letting our future leaders down. mark also believes the athletic department is not following its mission statement which is The Department of Intercollegiate Athletics support and extend the missions of UW Oshkosh by shaping an environment that promotes excellence in student achievement academic success and personal growth and identifies and communicates the needs and concerns of studentathletes to the University community and beyond PERIOD The Department of Intercollegiate Athletics is committed to providing an equitable multisport athletic program for male and female students. nowhere in the mission statement does it state the programs should be in a conference that provides championship status or automatic qualifier status Mark said PERIOD This sounds like the athletic director is reaching for reasons to support a poor decision that does not support the Universitys mission statement PERIOD Sincehave the funding available from donations why not keep the program going By working with the team to teach them how to budget and plan instead of giving up UWO could be known as an innovative university and could sustain this offering for many years to come. according to sophomore Jordan Anderson he and his teammates were given no suggestions or recommendations from administration on steps of how to keep the program running PERIOD

My first reaction after I heard that we were being cut was What can we do and How can we prevent it Anderson said PERIOD
 The administration really has given us no option PERIOD You would think that they would want to do everything they can to help prevent it same as we do PERIOD But it seems like theyre doing everything they can to make sure that it stays cut which is pretty backwards in my opinion. selffundraising has been outofthequestion since the beginning sophomore Logan Zastrow said PERIOD

Administration just doesnt want to go back on their word Zastrow said PERIOD Theres really no reason why we cant fundraise for ourselves PERIOD Theres no downside to us bringing in more money. while all of this offthecourt drama could have gotten in the way of his players games and practices Lewison said he is happy it did not PERIOD The head coach said he is proud of the way his athletes have treated the situation PERIOD

There hasnt been much drama at all which was surprising to me since I thought the guys might take out their frustration that the program was ending on me Lewison said PERIOD We have worked a lot on mental game and taking one point at a time to avoid what I call the snowball of frustration. overall the Titans are  on the season PERIOD They are  at home  away and  at neutral locations PERIOD Since they are conferenceless they do not have an overall conference record or a conference placing PERIOD

Friday April  and Saturday April  marked the last games that would ever be played on their home courts PERIOD On the twenty-second the Titans fell to UWWhitewater  and on the twenty-third they lost to both UWEau Claire and UWLa Crosse  PERIOD

The mens tennis team will play their in their final game as a UWO program on Saturday April  at Concordia University WI PERIOD
For player Billy OConnell cutting the team has been a nightmare but he is extremely thankful for even getting the opportunity to compete at UWO PERIOD After transferring from UWWhitewater this year to UWO for the tennis program he is happy to get just one year to play PERIOD
OConnell along with the majority of the team will not be transferring to a different school to continue playing NCAA tennis PERIOD He and his teammates already have plans to live in a house together next year PERIOD

We are making a club team next year OConnell said PERIOD We are always still optimistic that they could still bring it the tennis program back next year or the year after PERIOD We are trying to do some selffunding through the team PERIOD We think that this is our best bet. michael Leffler the father of David Leffler said he wishes the  athletes the best of luck in their future endeavors PERIOD

The University has made its decision Leffler said PERIOD It adversely affects a lot of young men PERIOD However I want to believe the athletic director and the chancellor did not make the decision on a whim PERIOD In life we all have to learn to deal with adversity PERIOD Sometimes life does not seem fair but we have to pick ourselves up and move on PERIOD I know these fine young athletes will demonstrate their strength of character their commitment to UWO and continue to achieve great things albeit off the court

As for Lewison he is still searching for what to do next PERIOD

Ive been really privileged to be able to have a variety of interesting jobs Lewison said PERIOD I would love the opportunity to coach another collegiate tennis team although this team is setting a very high bar with how easy it is to work with them. independent Student Newspaper of UW Oshkosh Campuses",UWO mens tennis finishes last season after 30 years - The Advance-Titan,"University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh"
