By Miles PowersHuang Staff Writer January  

As the whistle blew at the end of the fourth quarter in Illinois  loss to California on Dec PERIOD  in the Redbox Bowl the  season drew to a close PERIOD Before looking ahead to  its worth reminiscing over the Illinis performance this fall as the program had its most successful season in half a decade PERIOD

Preseason

Before the season kicked off there were more than a few notable events that had a negative effect on the program PERIOD Georgia tight end transfer Luke Ford was unexpectedly ruled ineligible for the season by the NCAA PERIOD Defensive lineman Bobby Roundtree suffered a poolrelated injury that would sideline him for the season and fourstar freshman athlete Marquez Beason suffered a seasonending knee injury in fall practice PERIOD

Aug PERIOD  Smith Center Opens

After boasting one of the worst facilities in the Power  conferences the program opened the Henry Dale and Betty Smith Football Center next to Memorial Stadium PERIOD The building serves as a tool both to aid in current players recovery game prep and recreation while also impressing prospective recruits on their official visits to campus PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

Aug PERIOD  Game  home vs Akron

Illinois opened the season with a resounding victory crushing Akron  PERIOD

Michigan transfer Brandon Peters began his Illinois career with  passing yards and  touchdowns and ran for another  yards and an additional score PERIOD Junior running back Mike Epstein returned after missing the large chunks of the previous two seasons with injuries and led the Illini with  yards on the ground PERIOD

USC transfers Trevon Sidney and Oluwole Betiku also had coming out parties as Sidney caught Peters first touchdown pass as an Illini and Betiku registered . sacks PERIOD Standout linebacker Jake Hansen had a day to remember as well registering both a fumble recovery and an interception PERIOD The win was punctuated by a major hit from newly eligible linebacker Milo Eifler who sat out  after transferring in from Washington PERIOD

Head coach Lovie Smith was pleased his team got out to a winning start PERIOD

Offense has played good football for a long period of time defense needed to step up and I thought they did Smith said PERIOD Not pleased with the first drive Akron had a couple of big plays in there PERIOD After that first series took care of business played the run well. sept PERIOD  Epstein goes down

At his weekly press conference Smith reported that Epstein had suffered his third consecutive seasonending injury this time in one of his knees PERIOD The injury bug was far from done in decimating Illinois roster however PERIOD

Sept PERIOD  Game  away at UConn

The Illini hadnt won on the road out of conference in over a decade but ended that skid with a  win over the Huskies PERIOD

After falling behind early it was Rod Smith and the offense that rescued the game for Illinois PERIOD

Peters threw four touchdown passes and two went to USC transfer receiver Josh Imatorbhebhe who unveiled his ability to make contested catches for the first time a trait that would rear its head again later in the year PERIOD

With senior tailback Reggie Corbin out injured it was the passing attack and latedefense that clinched the game as Dele Harding made a crucial fourthquarter interception that allowed Illinois to run the clock out PERIOD

Smith felt his team showed great resiliency in the comeback win PERIOD

When you win youre disappointed a little in your play that was the case Smith said PERIOD We didnt start off the way we wanted to but good football teams are gonna have to fight through adversity and get themselves out of a hole and its really tough when youre on the road and you get in the hole the way we did but we fought back through it. sept PERIOD  Game  home vs PERIOD Eastern Michigan

Easily the most disappointing moment on the field in  Illinois dropped its first game of the year to Eastern Michigan  PERIOD

The offense was lethargic for long stretches but got things together late and tied the game with  remaining as Imatorbhebhe took over Illinois final drive culminating in a 36yard touchdown catch PERIOD

The Eagles were unfazed however and calmly drove down to kick a gamewinning field goal as time expired PERIOD

Despite playing well Imatorbhebhe couldnt hide his frustration with the loss postgame PERIOD

I dont feel like we played our best football at all Imatorbhebhe said PERIOD Its hard to find the good in this if Im being honest because it just wasnt good at all PERIOD If anything we didnt really play that well and we still almost beat a team that was better than we thought they were so that shows the potential that we have. on the bright side for Illinois Peters again put up an impressive state line with  yards passing and Corbin returned to his  form with  yards rushing and a touchdown PERIOD Tight end Daniel Barker also had an impressive performance for the third consecutive week as he registered  yards receiving after catching touchdowns the previous two weeks PERIOD

Sept PERIOD  Game  home vs PERIOD Nebraska

Illinois showed an impressive level of offensive firepower and was in control for long periods of the game but Nebraska refused to go away and stole the game late  PERIOD

Corbin started things with a bang rushing for a 66yard touchdown on the opening drive and Hansen recovered a fumble on Nebraskas first possession setting up an early twoscore Illinois lead PERIOD

Unfortunately for the Illini Husker quarterback Adrian Martinez came alive throwing for  yards and rushing for another  PERIOD

WanDale Robinson cut the Illini defense open all game and his touchdown ended up sealing the game with eight minutes left PERIOD

Most alarmingly on a warm night in a primetime game that seemed built for big passing stats Peters threw for just  yards PERIOD

Imatorbhebhe continued to impress however registering yet another touchdown reception his fourth in three games PERIOD

Freshman athlete Isaiah Williams received his first snaps as well but was held in check PERIOD

There were many opportunities for Illinois to get Nebraska off the field but poor tackling kept many of the Huskers eventual scoring drives alive something Smith lamented PERIOD

We have to tackle better Smith said PERIOD We had them in favorable thirddown situations and missed tackles and not being able to make some plays really hurt us. oct PERIOD  Game  away at Minnesota

Peters suffered an early injury and the Illini were shellshocked from then on out PERIOD Redshirt freshman Matt Robinson couldnt move the ball and the Illini defense allowed  rushing yards and  points in a  loss PERIOD

A small victory for the Illini came in the form of two defensive touchdowns one from Harding and Eifler respectively PERIOD

Smith saw similar flaws from the Nebraska game in the Minnesota loss PERIOD

Dont know what else to tell you Smith said PERIOD How do big plays happen Missed tackles PERIOD Weve had too many missed tackles well continue to work on it. the blowout signaled the point of the season in which Smiths seat felt the hottest PERIOD

Oct PERIOD  Game  home vs Michigan

The Illini defied national opinions and stayed in the game late with the Wolverines but the maize and blues superior talent won out as they pulled away in the fourth for a  victory PERIOD

Robinson got the start and looked much better throwing for  yards and two total touchdowns PERIOD

I thought it was pretty fun out there I had a good time Robinson said PERIOD Thought we played pretty well came up a little bit short but I thought as an offense we did a pretty good job. a rushing touchdown from Dre Brown cut the deficit to  early in the fourth and for a brief moment it felt as though an upset may be on the cards but the Wolverines took care of business down the stretch PERIOD

Playing against a wellrespected defense Imatorbhebhe shined again registering  yards and a touchdown PERIOD

Oct PERIOD  Game  home vs Wisconsin

Undoubtedly the highlight of the season and the game that saved Smiths job Illinois put together a complete performance and shocked the country defeating undefeated No PERIOD  Wisconsin  PERIOD

Then walkon receiver Donny Navarro made an impressive runafterthecatch touchdown to get the offense going and the Illinois defense tightened up holding Wisconsin running back Jonathan Taylor well under his average yards per carry PERIOD

Late in the game the Badgers appeared to have the game wrapped up as Kendric Pryor got open over the top but backup defensive back Devon Witherspoon tackled him from behind at the three yardline and Wisconsin eventually settled for a field goal PERIOD A late interception from Tony Adams gave Illinois excellent field position for a gamewinning drive and James McCourt kicked a 39yard field goal as time expired to clinch the victory earning himself a proper dogpile from his teammates PERIOD

Honestly I think going through my head was some oxygen because I was passed out at the bottom of the pile supposedly McCourt said PERIOD I got lifted up and I thought I woke up from a dream or something PERIOD It was unbelievable. oct PERIOD  Sidney Done For Season

After missing multiple games Trevon Sidney was ruled out for the season with a leg injury opening the door for Navarro and freshman Casey Washington to see the field PERIOD

Oct PERIOD  Game  away at Purdue

In a wet and ugly game Illinois took advantage of a shorthanded Purdue team and stole a  victory in West Lafayette PERIOD

The passing game was nonexistent but Brown had a breakout performance running for  yards PERIOD Tony Adams who had been recently moved from safety to cornerback made a crucial picksix on a day where points were hard to come by PERIOD

The win brought the Illini back to . a sign of a secondhalf resurgence Smith was banking on PERIOD

Ill just to try to make the comparison with a football game PERIOD If youre behind at the half what has been decided Nothing really Smith said PERIOD Its how you perform that second half of the game and its how you perform the second half of the season PERIOD Our players buy into that PERIOD It also helps when you come out in the third quarter and you play well right away PERIOD It gets the momentum going and thats where we are. oct PERIOD  Lere Oladipo Incident

Hana Renee InmanGrabow a woman claiming to be previously involved with defensive tackle Lere Oladipo went public on her Twitter account with information and pictures alleging domestic abuse against Oladipo PERIOD The program addressed the situation saying it was aware of the allegations and Oladipo was eventually dismissed a few weeks later PERIOD He had previously not suited up for several games PERIOD

Nov PERIOD  Game  home vs Rutgers

Illinois cruised to a  victory behind a pair of Dre Brown rushing touchdowns while Imatorbhebhe found pay dirt in the air again catching a 52yard touchdown PERIOD

Hardings late picksix put a resounding stamp on the victory just one of many highlights from the linebackers stellar senior year and total career PERIOD

What can I say about Dele Harding Smith said PERIOD Senior captain makes all of the calls big hits interceptions touchdowns he makes just outstanding plays. the win left Smith and company cautiously optimistic about making a bowl game needing just one win out of the final three contests PERIOD

Nov PERIOD  Navarro Earns a Scholarship

After joining the program as a walkon transfer from FCS school Valparaiso Navarro was given a scholarship after stellar play in Sidneys absence PERIOD

Nov PERIOD  Game  away at Michigan State

Illinois capped the largest comeback in school history with a touchdown pass from Peters to Barker with five seconds reaming to become bowleligible PERIOD After falling behind  the Illini offense broke out for  yards in the  win PERIOD

Peters threw for  yards and  of those including two touchdowns went to Imatorbhebhe on just four catches PERIOD The pair also hooked up for a crucial fourth and  contestedconversion that was easily the most clutch play of the day PERIOD

The win put Illinois at  with two games remaining and a conference championship berth was not out of the question yet either PERIOD

Nov PERIOD  Game  away at Iowa

After punching above its weight against Wisconsin and Michigan State Illinois minus a string of defensive starters came back down to earth in a  loss at Iowa PERIOD The lone bright spot on the day came when Peters found Navarro on a perfectly executed wheel route for a 31yard touchdown PERIOD

Though both offenses were subpar Iowa found ways to kick field goals and held on for the win PERIOD

Nov PERIOD  Game  home vs Northwestern

While the Eastern Michigan loss may have been the most disappointing moment of the  season this game served as a close second as Illinois was easily handled by a  Northwestern team that was winless in the conference PERIOD

Peters and Imatorbhebhe sat out with injuries and the offense mustered just  total yards PERIOD

I just feel like we never really got into the groove of things said senior wide receiver Caleb Reams PERIOD Thirteen plays in the first half is never good. it certainly wasnt the way senior running back Reggie Corbin wanted to go out on Senior Day as he ran for  rushing yards in the  loss PERIOD

Dec PERIOD  Illinois accepts Redbox Bowl Invitation

After missing out on the postseason every year since  Illinois secured a berth in the Redbox Bowl against California PERIOD

Dec PERIOD  Game  Redbox Bowl vs California

Down pretty much every upperclassman contributor on both sides of the ball outside of Peters and Corbin Illinois fought hard but fell to the California  PERIOD

Though he fell far short of expectations in  after running for over  yards in  Corbin rushed for  yards and a touchdown to bring a positive end to his Illini career PERIOD

Forced to rely on the likes of Carlos Sandy and Trenard Davis on the outside Peters fought for  yards passing and a touchdown to Barker to complement his  rushing yards PERIOD

The Illini fell victim to more than a few tough officiating decisions on the day highlighted by a confirmed targeting call against Eifler and a questionable spot on a Peters fourthdown run PERIOD

Despite the loss Smith was proud of where his program had come from PERIOD

Theres a lot to build on Lovie Smith said PERIOD Its a process and as we continue to take steps with our program a bar has been set PERIOD It was a lot of fun going to our first bowl game and were excited to see what the future can be. though the season didnt end how many wanted it to it is undeniable that the program is in a much better place than it was  months ago PERIOD And with a new worldclass facility to go along with lots of talent coming in either through transfers injuries or high school recruiting the trajectory of the program appears to be pointing up heading into  PERIOD
