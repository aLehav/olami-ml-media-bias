Editors note This story discusses themes including sexual violence PERIOD

Environmental management and protection freshman Lauren Tillotson was shocked to receive the first Clery Act notification in her inbox on Oct PERIOD  which notified students of a rape in Architecture Graveyard PERIOD Within a week a second email arrived with news of another oncampus sexual assault PERIOD

It made me pretty uncomfortable knowing just how often it happens Tillotson said PERIOD The descriptions were like  and  male and you look around and its like it could be anyone. on Oct PERIOD  the university sent the second email informing the campus community that another rape had occurred within the same week with different descriptions of the suspects PERIOD

Tillotson said that she didnt find the description from the recent assault very helpful given that the description was vague enough to describe many individuals both on and off campus PERIOD

The university distributed the notifications in compliance with the timely warning function of the Jeanne Clery Act which requires university officials to notify the campus community when certain crimes occur PERIOD

Clery Director and Title IX Coordinator Maren Hufton said that the Clery Act is a consumer protection law that requires higher education institutions to make disclosures about crimes reported on campus PERIOD

The purpose of the act is to inform our customers our consumers  parents and students and visitors to our campus  about whether they want to come to our university or even visit the space according to Hufton PERIOD

The Clery Act does not prevent crime but rather serves as a transparency function Hufton said PERIOD

During a presentation led by SAFER for alarmed parents following the second reported rape the confidential resource center outlined the criteria for Clery Act crimes that would warrant a timely warning PERIOD

The parameters of a timely warning are actually extremely narrow Assistant Director for Wellbeing Kara Samaniego said PERIOD

First campus security authority needs to be aware that a crime has occurred PERIOD

The crime must also be a Clery reportable crime PERIOD Clery Act crimes include criminal offenses such as sexual assault homicide or robbery hate crimes and offenses under the Violence Against Women Act PERIOD

The crime must also have occurred in Clery geography PERIOD At Cal Poly Clery geography is anywhere on campus or any other universitycontrolled property PERIOD This includes officially registered sorority and fraternity houses PERIOD

Lastly the threat must be considered serious and ongoing. chief of Police George Hughes in collaboration with Maren Hufton determines whether the threat is serious and ongoing on a casebycase basis PERIOD

Chief Hughes said that the police will talk to whoever they need to in order to determine the presence of a serious and ongoing threat PERIOD

Its not that we make these decisions in a vacuum Hughes said PERIOD It really comes down to what information we can get and how quickly we can get it. sometimes the police department does not have enough information to discern if a crime falls under the Clery Act such as when the location is unknown PERIOD Sometimes police are able to mitigate a serious threat so it is no longer a present danger. other times the information the police have about a Clery Act crime cannot be released to the public PERIOD

Sometimes we just cant put out a lot of information Hughes said PERIOD When we cant put out information for whatever reason  whether it be for the integrity of the investigation or privacy laws  people are going to always think of the worst. hughes said the information that can be provided to students is determined on a casebycase basis PERIOD

It depends on the incident itself Hughes said PERIOD If we have an ongoing investigation which we do in these matters I cannot release anything that could jeopardize the integrity of that investigation. releasing too much information could hinder identifying a suspect according to Hughes PERIOD

Hufton said that the university does not release information about cases of sexual assault unless there is a requirement to do so PERIOD She said it is a tremendous misfortune that members of the campus community may assume Cal Poly responds to sexual assault allegations from a PR standpoint because thats not generally what she thinks about when following processes and procedures required by the law PERIOD

We strive to keep everything as private as possible Hufton said PERIOD Thats a victims right. hughes said until the recent notifications there has not been a crime that falls under the criteria for the Clery Act since  PERIOD

University Spokesperson Matt Lazier said that the recent notifications relating to sexual assault do not correlate to rising rates of sexual assault PERIOD

Its a mistake to look at reports that are based on circumstances of individual cases and use that as an interpretation to mean that the rates of crimes are going up Lazier said PERIOD Youre talking about apples and oranges there. moreover students may not be notified when reported cases have been solved even when such cases have been made public in compliance with the Clery Act PERIOD

Following a timely warning campus officials will determine whether or not it is in the best interest of students to update them on whether the suspect has been apprehended PERIOD

Hufton said the university is not required to notify students when a suspect has been identified following a timely warning PERIOD

After a sexual assault has been reported to the police department Hughes said the police investigate the crime and fulfill the duty of a mandated reporter PERIOD

Investigations following a reported sexual assault are centered around the needs of the victim PERIOD

The criminal investigation is driven by the survivor and how willing he or she is to have an actual criminal investigation Hughes said PERIOD

Lazier said that overall the message is that cases are dealt with on a casebycase basis and that the university has the interest of the campus community and those involved in these cases in mind PERIOD

Were trying to balance the privacy issues the safety issues and the integrity of the investigation to reach a resolution that keeps everyone safe and holds people accountable for things theyve done wrong Lazier said PERIOD

Tilletson said her friends are a lot more cautious when deciding to go out and carrying pepper spray is the new normal PERIOD

The people Ive talked to are just unsettled by the unsolved case Tilletson said PERIOD Its kind of unnerving. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
