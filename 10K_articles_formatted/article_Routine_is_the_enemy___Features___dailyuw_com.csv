Updated November     pm



















We see it every January PERIOD Gyms and fitness centers swell with people fulfilling annual selfimprovement resolutions PERIOD Some will achieve their goals most will lose interest PERIOD At a basic level the goals of a beginner and the goals of a Division I athlete are the same to achieve results and to enjoy the workout PERIOD

Few people understand the value of achieving fitness results more than the U.S PERIOD Navy SEALs PERIOD When members of the elite special operations community began switching to an unusual workout called CrossFit thousands of serious athletes took notice PERIOD

 said Scott Takenaga a trainer at Level  CrossFit Seattle located on Leary Way PERIOD 

While CrossFit was quickly adopted by firefighters Army rangers and even mixedmartialarts fighters in preparation for a nationallytelevised fight it is also used by the likes of the Utah Jazz Dance Team which relies on CrossFit to maintain the high level of fitness required for performances PERIOD

 said Kristina Burton a Washington alumna PERIOD 

Crossfit was developed by Greg Glassman a former gymnast who opened a gym in Santa Cruz Calif PERIOD during the mid90s PERIOD Glassman began posting his Workout of the Day on his Web site in  PERIOD The Workout of the Day or WoD is still updated daily at www.Crossfit.com PERIOD

What originated as a single gym and a Web site expanded rapidly as its reputation spread and people around the country started their own CrossFit gyms PERIOD Today there are more than  CrossFit affiliates internationally including facilities created by soldiers and Marines currently fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan PERIOD

CrossFit has helped individuals recover from injuries PERIOD One former Navy SEAL suffered a back injury and implemented CrossFit workouts in his recovery process PERIOD Now in his 40s he claims that in addition to recovering from his injury he is currently in better shape than he was as a 25yearold Navy SEAL PERIOD

 said Nate Thornton a Washington alumnus PERIOD 

Busy students and working professionals will find the decreased time commitment convenient to fit the demands of packed schedules PERIOD CrossFit workouts are done in a very short period of time  a full workout can be completed in as little as  minutes PERIOD

 Burtain said PERIOD 

CrossFit workouts were originally created to be done in a garage and a membership to a CrossFit gym is not required as workouts and video demonstrations are posted for free online PERIOD

 said Robert Howell a UW alumnus PERIOD

After lifting weights for about five years Howell switched to the CrossFit program and was able to recover from a recurring shoulder injury PERIOD

Although the workouts are available online for free many CrossFit practitioners come to gyms for the sense of community and encouragement that comes with completing a difficult workout in the company of others PERIOD

 Takenaga said PERIOD 

Although many swear by the CrossFit workout its not for everyone PERIOD Some may not enjoy the intensity of the workouts and as with any exercise program improper form could result in serious injury PERIOD

 Takenaga said PERIOD 

Many who do enjoy the program appreciate its variety as expressed by one of the most popular CrossFit maxims 

To prevent what athletes refer to as  each CrossFit workout is varied between the muscles worked and the nature of the exercise PERIOD Workouts can vary from weighted squats to ring dips or medicineball throws to sprints PERIOD

 Howell said PERIOD 

After avoiding his old weightlifting routine for six weeks Howell found he increased his incline press from  pounds to  pounds even though he had not done that exercise in more than a month and a half PERIOD

 Takenaga said PERIOD
