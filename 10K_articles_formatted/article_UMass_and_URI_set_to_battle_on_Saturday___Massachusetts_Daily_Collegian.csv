The Massachusetts womens soccer team welcomes Rhode Island to Rudd Field on Saturday with the Rams still looking for their first conference win PERIOD

Rhode Island   Atlantic  is coming off a  loss to Dayton on Sunday PERIOD

UMass coach Ed Matz is on high alert going into Saturdays  p.m PERIOD game PERIOD

I think that not only is Rhode Island a very good team theyre a very hungry team Matz said PERIOD Their backs are against the wall PERIOD They dont want to start  so I think its a very dangerous game for us. the Rams are a team thats also competing directly with the Minutewomen for one of the eight playoff spots in the A10 making this game especially critical for UMass   A10 if its to return trip to the playoffs PERIOD

In order to pull out a win Matz said his team needs to match Rhode Islands intensity PERIOD

We have to make sure that were the team thats more hungry Matz said PERIOD One team is going to have a lot easier path to the playoffs after Saturdays match. history shows the Minutewomen are going to need a fast start if they want to come out of Saturdays game with a victory in hand

UMass is  this season when it scores first and  when it allows the first goal PERIOD

I thing its important to come out prepared to get that first goal is huge especially for us Matz said PERIOD

The way this Minutewomen team creates early opportunities begins with sound defensive play PERIOD

The unit  led by senior goalkeeper Emily Cota and starting defenders junior Lauren Skesavage and freshmen Georgia Gibson Madison Smith and Rebekka Sverrisdottir  continues to be a focal point for this team PERIOD

Together the Minutewomen have kept their opponents to a . goalsagainst average which ranks sixth in the A10 PERIOD And when the ball does get by the defense the UMass goalkeepers are there to back their teammates up with a conferenceleading . saves per game PERIOD

Despite its strong play Saturday wont be an easy task for the UMass defense to contain URI PERIOD

The Rams have two prolific scoring threats in senior forward Ashley Evangelista and junior forward Jennifer Barrientos PERIOD

Evangelista leads the Rams with five goals and  points on the season but Barrientos isnt far behind with her four goals and  points along with a teamleading three assists PERIOD

Matz said the Minutewomens defensive play is key to the teams success not only on Saturday but for the rest of the season PERIOD

I think weve established ourselves this year as a team that needs our defense to come out Matz said PERIOD We need our defense to play well PERIOD Everything we do in the game kind of focuses around our defense PERIOD So hopefully we will come out well be aggressive on defense and well win a lot of balls on defense. cameron McDonough can be reached at camemailprotected and followed on Twitter MDCMcDonough PERIOD
