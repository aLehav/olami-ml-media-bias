Mary Poppins said it best  sometimes a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. the saying refers to the general idea that accomplishing something unpleasant is more doable by manufacturing a bit of fun but it can be seen quite literally in the world of medicine PERIOD We inject all sorts of sweetness into unpleasant tasks especially those for children such as adding fruity flavoring to cough syrups shaping vitamins like cartoon characters and rewarding them with a piece of candy for good behavior at a doctors appointment PERIOD Administering shots is much more difficult to sweeten not much can be done about the fact that the needle is going to pinch PERIOD

Still many doctors and nurses try their best by making shots into a fun game or by promising a special bandage after PERIOD Ensuring proper medical care is necessary to support individuals in leading their best lives and to produce a healthier population but sometimes this care can be uncomfortable frightening and downright painful PERIOD Many medical practitioners and institutions emphasize compassion understanding and a little bit of sweetness to support their patients through difficult procedures PERIOD Unfortunately this principle does seem to have its limits especially when a medical issue becomes highly publicized PERIOD At present the societal response to the hot button issue of the antivaccine movement has been overwhelmingly bitter PERIOD

Its understandable why its difficult to take a saccharine approach to such a scary issue PERIOD Many believe the antivaccine movement will leave a large population vulnerable to illnesses with horrifying side effects which ravaged entire societies just decades ago PERIOD As such the fear and rhetoric surrounding antivaccination are somewhat out of proportion to the actual scale of decreasing vaccinations PERIOD According to a  report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC vaccination rates remain relatively stable and high PERIOD Still the same report does note that the proportion of children receiving no vaccines by  months of age has increased albeit slightly and gradually PERIOD This small increase matters however the decline in vaccinations is often credited as causing a global resurgence of preventable diseases inhibiting the goal of eradication PERIOD

Measles is an especially notable example  although it was declared eliminated from the United States in  it has recently made an infamous comeback PERIOD The year  saw the highest number of reported cases since  totaling  as of September  PERIOD The prospect of measles and other debilitating and deadly diseases returning to the U.S PERIOD is certainly terrifying so the vitriolic reaction to the antivaccine movement seems only natural PERIOD The term antivaxxer has become pejorative often grouped with the same type of stupid as flatearthers and climate change deniers PERIOD Unfortunately this vilification is unlikely to sway those hesitant about vaccination to the positive side PERIOD

In fact a hateful response only serves to deepen divides allowing the antivaccine movement to create a narrative of persecution PERIOD With the antivaccine sentiment taking a continually deeper hold in the U.S. it is imperative to reassess how we are approaching this movement and shifting the basis of our policies and discussions to understanding and compassion PERIOD

For one skepticism of vaccination is often treated as ignorance and stupidity PERIOD But many people have personal and cultural histories with the institution of medicine that lead to understandable hesitation and mistrust which may include the prospect of vaccination PERIOD Furthermore the concept of vaccination is certainly not intuitive PERIOD The narrative of illness prevention is largely based on avoiding germs so the idea of having germs inserted into ones body seems directly in opposition PERIOD Beyond active or inactive viral cultures many other ingredients that compose vaccines do not merely seem scary  we have been warned to avoid them notably formaldehyde and mercurycontaining thimerosal PERIOD Of course vaccines have been well established as scientifically and medically safe PERIOD But a mere statement of safety accompanied by absolute authority instead of understandable evidence can be intimidating and isolating rather than convincing PERIOD

Skepticism is largely treated as irrational and unreasonable but this blackandwhite response is incredibly invalidating and frustrating PERIOD Instead patients should be treated as rational capable of having reasonable concerns and discussions about the evidence behind vaccine safety PERIOD Reason is a far more effective response than resentment PERIOD

It is also important to acknowledge the emotions which accompany vaccination PERIOD These emotions may contribute to irrational thinking but mitigating irrational responses are not always accomplished by outright ignoring such feelings PERIOD

Often the decision against vaccination is made by parents on behalf of their children and many vaccines are scheduled for the first couple of months of life PERIOD Parents are tasked with the heavy responsibility of caring for this delicate fragile new person so its understandable that protective instincts may kick in at the thought of several massive needles containing viral cultures being injected into them PERIOD

YouTuber Unnatural Vegan summarizes this well noting her own emotional response to her childs vaccination  while her rational side knows vaccines are safe and necessary her emotions did cause a moment of hesitation PERIOD For a new parent who doesnt understand vaccination and has never seen the diseases they prevent such emotions may cause an even more influential response PERIOD Instead of invalidating this emotional response the focus should instead be on increasing understanding of the technology and the importance of vaccination PERIOD

Validate protective parental instincts and channel them into protecting children from preventable and potentially deadly diseases PERIOD Instead of operating with absolute authority treat parents as autonomous decisionmakers in their childrens health supported by medicine rather than ruled by it PERIOD

Clearly the bitter approach to the antivaccine is not the most effective one PERIOD Maybe its time to try employing a bit of sweetness instead PERIOD Maybe its a spoonful of compassion  rather than hatred  that we should utilize in the effort to quell the influence of the antivaccine movement PERIOD Vaccines absolutely are a revolutionary priceless public health technology that should be embraced and utilized by as many people as possible PERIOD

Creating a more positive attitude toward vaccination will not be accomplished by fighting fire with fire  or by reacting to ambivalence with bitterness PERIOD Finding a smarter approach to this prickly subject is not just crucial for the health outcomes of individuals  it is a public health imperative PERIOD
