Iowa pitcher Grant Leonard prepares to throw the ball during the game against UC Irvine at Duane Banks Field on Saturday May   PERIOD

Pete Ruden Pregame Editor February  

Iowa baseball kicked its season off on a high note taking down Kent State and Saint Josephs in its first two games PERIOD But it couldnt complete the perfect weekend PERIOD

After beating the Golden Flashes  and toppling the Hawks  the Hawkeyes fell to Pittsburgh in a highscoring affair  in the most unlikely of circumstances on Sunday PERIOD

Secondteam AllAmerican closer Grant Leonard entered the game for Iowa in the eighth inning with an  lead in his back pocket PERIOD

He then blew his first save in more than a year PERIOD

Leonard gave up four earned runs on four hits in . innings of work as the Panthers scored five runs in the eighth to complete the comeback PERIOD

Leonards weekend wasnt completely overshadowed by his rough outing on Sunday however PERIOD

The Mokena Illinois native recorded his first save of the new campaign in Iowas victory over Kent State on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

The Hawkeyes took a lead over the Golden Flashes in the third inning and never looked back PERIOD

With a  lead in the ninth Leonard took the Kent State lineup down in order and punched out two batters to put an exclamation mark on Iowas seasonopening win PERIOD

But Leonard wasnt the only Hawkeye pitcher shining PERIOD

Starter Jack Dreyer pitched his first meaningful innings since Feb PERIOD   and he impressed PERIOD Dreyer pitched five strong innings giving up only two hits and striking out eight PERIOD

After allowing a leadoff walk Dreyer recorded nine consecutive outs including a stretch of four straight strikeouts to end the first and second innings PERIOD

It felt good Dreyer said in a release PERIOD It felt nice to be with the team again and travel with them PERIOD My confidence was at an alltime high PERIOD I know that my team is going to help support me on defense and offense PERIOD We went out there and did our jobs. the Hawkeyes continued their streak of strong pitching into their win over Saint Josephs on Feb PERIOD  as well PERIOD

Starter Grant Judkins kept the Hawks scoreless for four innings before allowing two runs in the fifth PERIOD

Shortly after Trenton Wallace and Ben Probst combined to allow just one hit in four scoreless innings to close the game PERIOD

The offense was just as good PERIOD

Outfielder Ben Norman celebrated his birthday on Feb PERIOD  by going 4for4 with two RBIs and two runs scored PERIOD

Luckily we had a good scouting report on the guy Norman said in a release PERIOD I got some good pitches in some good locations got my barrel on it and found some holes PERIOD Im glad to get on for the guys and they can hit me in. it ended up being a celebration for Iowa as a team picking up its second win in dominant fashion PERIOD

I liked the way it started Iowa head coach Rick Heller said in a release PERIOD The guys came out with a lot of energy PERIOD Grant Judkins went five innings and pitched extremely well PERIOD Ben Norman on his birthday went 4for4 and had a great day. email emailprotected
