If theres one band Ive listened to thats helped me get through some tough times its Against Me I heard of them in high school when my friend lent me a copy of Searching for a Former Clarity and I instantly fell in love with everything about the band PERIOD Most importantly I began to admire frontman Tom Gabels loud harsh voice and thoughtprovoking lyrics PERIOD The album was about a decaying society filled with distrust and fear with a small ray of hope at the end of the tunnel and ended with the titular Searching for a Former Clarity a ballad that tells the story of a man dying from either cancer or AIDS PERIOD

Recently Gabel has been featured in media outlets and in music magazines particularly Rolling Stone after coming out as a transgender PERIOD When I first heard about this I was in complete shock PERIOD I couldnt believe the photo of Gabel featured in Rolling Stonesitting cross legged in nothing but a towel looking quite feminine PERIOD Apparently the Gainesville Florida rocker has suffered from gender dysphoria since childhood he has never felt comfortable in a mans body and had always wanted to be a woman PERIOD Gabel even told Rolling Stone he prayed to God repeatedly to wake up a woman and when nothing happened he began to pray to Satan PERIOD

After the shock of it all had subsided I thought about several of Gabels lyrics that might have been clues to his gender dysphoria of which he kept a secret until recently PERIOD

In the song Searching for a Former Clarity he sings

Confessing childhood secrets

Of dressing up in womens clothes

Compulsions you never knew

The reasons to PERIOD



In The Ocean there is a more blatant lyric

If I could have chosen

I would have been born a woman

My mother once told me

She would have named me Laura



When I first heard this lyric I admired Gabels open mind and found it to be beautiful PERIOD Now with Gabel coming out as a transgender it makes much more sense and represents an even stronger force than it did before PERIOD Even the bands name is about conflict against the self PERIOD

I fully support Gabels choice and am actually excited to see what will become of Against Me Gabel will be undergoing electrolysis and will live as a woman for one year before deciding on having a sex change operation PERIOD Gabel states the hormones will not affect his voice PERIOD

imagine me Gabel told Rolling Stone six foot two in heels fucking screaming in someones face PERIOD

Against Mes next album Transgender Dysphoria Blues is currently being recorded and is a concept album about a transgender prostitute PERIOD

His bandmates as well as his mother and his wife Heather all support his transition PERIOD

Tom Gabel will be going under the name Laura Jane Grace being that Laura is what his mother would have named him had he been born a woman PERIOD",JAM: Tom Gabel’s Transgender Dysphoria Blues – The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
