For those of you who read The Quest for the Ultimate Burrito what could possible go better with your favorite blend of meat beans cheese and salsa than the best margarita in town Yep you guessed it  nothing PERIOD  Some of you might think that all margaritas are the same but guess again PERIOD They are a delicate blend of tequila triple sec and lime juice that can leave you with a horrible taste in your mouth and a hole in your wallet with one small mistake in measurement or liquor choice PERIOD

So who has the best mixture price and atmosphere To keep it simple I went to four Mexican restaurants and ordered their house margarita on the rocks PERIOD Please dont try this at home kids PERIOD After drinking four margaritas in three hours things start to get a little crazy PERIOD So I set aside an afternoon and went on a noble yet drunken quest to find the perfect margarita PERIOD

Coming in last place was Seor Matias located on ninetieth Street just north of Center PERIOD On first glance the place looks old and rundown PERIOD Upon entering you notice your initial impression is correct PERIOD I sat down and ordered their cheapest house margarita and that is exactly what I got PERIOD Seor Matias makes their house margaritas with Montezuma tequila about as low in the tequila food chain as you can go PERIOD Not only was the tequila offensive but there was also an overpowering salty taste that mingled with its limeade counterpart in a most disgusting fashion PERIOD However they do have the secondcheapest margaritas at . pERIOD To top it all off I was not impressed with the service and knew there was a better concoction out there PERIOD

The cheapest for the four restaurants was La Fondas on one hundred and twenty-third and Center which was enough to earn them third place in my quest PERIOD They charge . for their house margarita and actually handpour them to order PERIOD Their choice of tequila is Jose Cuervo a step up from Montezuma in my opinion PERIOD The margarita was too limey and the Cuervo had a pungent tangy flavor and made for an unsmooth mixture PERIOD Out of the four restaurants La Fondas had something going for it that the others did not  a really funky smell PERIOD I actually spent more time trying to figure out what two scents could have possibly come together to make such a distinctive and terrifying smell than not enjoying my margarita PERIOD

My second to best pick was Roja on one hundred and sixty-eighth and Center PERIOD They have more than  tequilas to choose from and make their house margaritas with Pepe Lopez PERIOD The flavor was the best so far but still felt a little too tangy and it was the most expensive at . pERIOD The atmosphere was really modern and relaxed but still lacked the authentic feel that I wanted PERIOD Roja also got points for excellent service and original presentation PERIOD Instead of using the same cactus glass I found at the other three restaurants they did a plain glass that mixed well with the overall feel of the bar PERIOD

My quest concluded at one hundred and tenth and Maple where I found the ultimate margarita hiding out at La Mesa PERIOD Despite the fact that their house margarita is the second most expensive at . the taste blew the others out of the water PERIOD La Mesa uses Sauza tequila in their house margaritas which makes for one smooth and tasty margarita PERIOD Their signature mix had the perfect hint of sweetness to counter the tanginess of the lime PERIOD They also had the most authentic atmosphere and was the only place to give me free chips and salsa with my drink PERIOD

When my quest was over I needed some ibuprofen and a tall glass of water PERIOD Even though I couldnt see straight the winner was clear and La Mesa defiantly rose above the competition PERIOD Roja was a close second but lacked in over all mixture and authentic atmosphere PERIOD La Mesa had the total package and their free chips and salsa are the perfect compliment to the smooth taste of their Sauza margaritas PERIOD
