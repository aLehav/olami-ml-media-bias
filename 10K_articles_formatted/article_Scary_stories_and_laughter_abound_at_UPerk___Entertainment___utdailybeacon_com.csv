Costumed students bonded over coffee and Halloween stories at UPerk Thursday night PERIOD

A storytelling event held by the coffee house gave those who came to UPerk the chance to dress up in Halloween costumes tell each other stories and learn about the importance of storytelling in the process PERIOD

Students dressed in a wide variety of costumes everything from a pair of Ty Beanie Babies to one of Disneys Incredibles was present at the event PERIOD

After mingling attendees grabbed snacks and sat down at one of the many tables at UPerk and ordered complimentary coffee tea apple cider or hot chocolate ready for the storytelling to begin PERIOD

UPerk hospitality intern Mary Grace Reynolds opened the event with a few remarks on the value of storytelling explaining how it has declined in popularity in the age of information but remains no less relevant PERIOD She then proceeded to share a few brief historical ghost stories beginning with the legend of Dolly Madisons ghost residence in the gardens of the White House PERIOD

Following Reynolds seven more students walked up one at a time to the tall brown armchair and spiderwebcovered table at the front of the room and delivered their stories to the audience PERIOD

Some stories were scary as expected but others were lighthearted and funny such as Dr PERIOD Seusss The Lorax and an interactive story in the style of Mad Libs which produced a nonsensical tale about witches PERIOD

A round of applause followed each story and bursts of laughter intermittently filled the room throughout the night as the storytellers made jokes and spoke in intentionally spooky voices PERIOD

After each storyteller said his or her piece the guests were invited to chat and decide on the performers and costumes they thought were the best and the most original PERIOD

Sophie Lowe junior in therapeutic recreation and winner of most original story at the event explained what she gained from the night and learned about the value of storytelling explaining that there are so many different ways to get your point across thats not just saying You really should do this. sophomore in therapeutic recreation Rebecca Thompson who was costumed as Bee Happy for the night concurred and commented on the diversity of the stories at the event PERIOD

You had everything from Dr PERIOD Seuss to originally written stories to things that people found online  it was really cool to just hear all the different stories that people had to tell Thompson said PERIOD

Once the event was officially over guests did not immediately leave but instead lingered in the coffee house to visit with friends PERIOD Reynolds who closed the gathering declared UPerks scary story event a success and explained what she is looking for in the coffee houses future

I want to brainstorm and host more events that let students have more of a hand in itI think part of the greatness of this is that its primarily studentrun in nature because theyre the ones doing all the performing. log In
