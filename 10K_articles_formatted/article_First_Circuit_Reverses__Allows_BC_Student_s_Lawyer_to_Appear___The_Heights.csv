3714,2019-11-04,"the U.S PERIOD Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled on Friday that the Boston College student who had been suspended after the University had found him responsible for sexual assault will be represented by his attorney of choice at Tuesdays oral arguements PERIOD

First Circuit Judge David J PERIOD Barron had originally blocked Jeannie Suk Gersen a Harvard law professor who has written about due process violations in Title IX investigations and represented students in similar cases from representing the student John Doe at the oral arguments PERIOD Barrons Oct PERIOD  order came with a note that the motion for Gersen to appear was denied because it would create a recusal. the members of the threejudge panel had not been announced at that time PERIOD

Barron was a Harvard law professor from  to  and again from  to  when he was appointed to the First Circuit PERIOD He remains the Honorable S PERIOD William Green Visiting Professor of Public Law PERIOD Barron is the only judge on the First Circuit to have worked at Harvard PERIOD

Gersen has taught at Harvard since  PERIOD

The University suspended Doe in June after finding him responsible for the sexual assault of another BC student Jane Roe. after the University denied Does appeal in late July the two parties quickly went to court PERIOD On Aug PERIOD  District Court Judge Douglas P PERIOD Woodlock ordered BC to allow Doe a studentathlete to register for classes and participate in all University activities PERIOD

Woodlocks decision to send Doe back to campus largely rested on his ruling that BCs investigatory modelin which two investigators interview the claimant the accused student and any witnesses separatelyfailed to adequately address questions of credibility and potentially violated Does right to a fair process PERIOD

Doe had hired Gersen on Oct PERIOD  because Stuart Bernstein his attorney who had led the case through district court left work after his brother suddenly died on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Bernstein who was very close to his brother was unable to work as appellate counsel as he grieved with his brothers children according to the motion to reconsider Doe filed on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Bernstein also observed several Jewish traditions including Shiva a weeklong mourning period Sheloshim which lasts a month and the twiceaday recitation of the Mourners Kaddish according to the motion to reconsider PERIOD As he did not return to work until midOctober after the Jewish High Holy Days Bernstein was unable to continue his work for Doe in the weeks leading up to the appeal the motion to reconsider said PERIOD

Tara Davis another attorney who had worked on the lawsuit in both the District Court and the appeal began her previouslyscheduled maternity leave on Oct PERIOD  according to the motion to reconsider PERIOD

The motion to reconsider said that Doe retained Gersen because she was the only attorney that Doe considered prepared and ready to step in immediately for Mr PERIOD Brenstein and comply with the courts briefing and argument schedule. the motion took issue with the effect of the courts ordernamely that it would deny Doe of his chosen representation PERIOD It also noted that the federal statute on judicial recusal states the circumstances in which judges shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned but does not mention circumstances in which a judge would prevent an attorney from appearing to preserve his own impartiality PERIOD

Does legal team said in the motion that they have inferred that it was Barron who felt he might have a conflict of interest if his colleague had appeared at arguments PERIOD

The motion said that the selection of Gersen was not intended to cause any ethical issues for judges PERIOD

Appellee and counsel had no reason to question any First Circuit judges impartiality including Judge Barrons the motion to reconsider said PERIOD Multiple sitting judges regularly teach courses at Harvard Law School with ongoing and renewed appointments as visiting professors or lecturers without creating issues of recusal when the schools faculty members appear in their courts PERIOD

What is truly extraordinary however is to prevent Appellee from having his chosen attorney appear in this Court in order to represent him PERIOD Appellee is unable to find any case in which a judge concerned about the necessity of his own recusal chose instead to prevent an attorney from appearing on behalf of her client PERIOD A judges recusal rather than denial of a litigants choice of attorney is the customary remedy in Courts of Appeals. the motion also took issue with a lack of transparency surrounding the order and argued that if Barron was the judge who would have needed a recusal then he should have recused himself from the order barring her appearance PERIOD

On Oct PERIOD  the First Circuit announced that Judges Sandra L PERIOD Lynch Michael Boudin and Kermit V PERIOD Lipez would hear Does appeal PERIOD Barron will serve on every other panel as will Judge Norman H PERIOD Stahl PERIOD

That same day Lynch Boudin and Lipez denied Does motion to reconsider PERIOD A day later the order was corrected to note that Lipez had dissented in the decision to uphold Barrons order PERIOD

In response Does legal team asked for the full First Circuit to review the order PERIOD The petition argued that the decision to bar an attorney from appearing to prevent a recusal was both unprecedented and could have negative effects on future appeals cases PERIOD

Doe respectfully submits that the question is of exceptional importance to litigants in the First Circuit going forward because after the unprecedented Order in this case litigants may reasonably wonder whether a court could simply disqualify their chosen counsel based on an unidentified wouldbe recusal of an unnamed judge for an unexplained reason the petition said PERIOD Counsel in this jurisdiction may also reasonably wonder whether after their zealous efforts on behalf of their clients they could be disqualified from appearing because it would cause a recusal of an unidentified judge whom are unaware of having any cause for recusal. before the court could respond to the second petition however Lynch Boudin and Lipez reversed course in a Nov PERIOD  order and permitted Gersen to argue before them PERIOD
