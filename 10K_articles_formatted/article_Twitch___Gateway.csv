You twitch in your sleep PERIOD	At first your face is peaceful	a swell of silence a blank lullaby	waiting twiddling its thumbs for lyrics	written by Queen Mabs calligraphy PERIOD	Instead the honest Puck	Sneaks up with dustings of tripped	Up fairy musk curling up	Your nose with its more or less distasteful	Scent PERIOD	Like an old dog twitching at a	Bad dream you shoo away Hermias	Irksome trouble or at least you try PERIOD	It frightens me a little the way	Your body stutters as if the	Weird Sisters are casting Macbeths	Prophecies and nights of	Invisible blood PERIOD	If I could I would brush away	The spider beds inked with dew and anxieties	From your head PERIOD

I love to see the lullaby when you sleep PERIOD
