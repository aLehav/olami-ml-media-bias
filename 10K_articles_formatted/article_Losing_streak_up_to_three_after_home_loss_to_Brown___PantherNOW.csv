The FIU Panthers dropped their third straight home loss this Friday in the hands of the No PERIOD  Brown University Bears losing  sinking to a  overall record for the  season PERIOD

It was just one of those days that just didnt go our way ApplebaumDallau said PERIOD We just need to regroup and get ready for next Friday and finish the season on a high note PERIOD Bottom line we need to get ready for Conference play with the Sun Belt Tournament coming up. right out of the gate FIU played themselves into a hole as they went winless in doubles going  PERIOD Even the dynamic duo of Seniors Lisa Johnson and Christine Seredni could not take down the Brown Bears tag team of AllSecond team Ivy League Senior Carissa Aboukakre alongside Ft PERIOD Lauderdales own and freshman Laura Wiley PERIOD

Despite the high velocity serves and powerful returns Johnson and Seredni came up short in a  loss PERIOD

Junior Rita Maisak and freshman Sarah Mclean who claimed the only win for FIU also added to the Panthers woes in doubles suffering a  defeat to Browns other All Ivy League second teamer Cassandra Hertzberg and Sophmore Jessica Harrow PERIOD

I definitely did not think I played as well as I could in doubles Mclean said PERIOD I just need to stay focused and keep playing aggressive. fIU wrapped up doubles with a lackluster performance from Sophmore Giulietta Boha and freshman Nina Djordjevic as Browns Misia Kraowski and Julie Flanzer shut them out  PERIOD

As for singles the Panthers could not claw their way back and get the victory tallying just one win out of the six individual matches PERIOD Mclean was the lone Panther of the pack to clinch the win as she started slow by dropping the first set  but regained her composure and came back with a vengeance in the second set winning  PERIOD This set victory sent the match into a tiebreaker where Mclean sealed the deal with  win beating Cassy Hertzberg PERIOD

I think I really picked it up in singles Mclean stated PERIOD Im very proud the way I fought back and won the match. lisa Johnson could not follow up on her spectacular performance versus FAU and didnt seem as if she came out with the right energy dwindling to a   defeat to Browns Harrow PERIOD

Maisak also came out on the losing end of   of a slugfest by getting defeat by Junior Misia Kraowski PERIOD Maisak just could not establish a consistent rhythm PERIOD as went for the kill shot on almost every point and did not focus on hitting the open spots on the court PERIOD

Djordjevic avoided a serious facial or head injury in her   loss as she lept and dove onto the court in attempt to salvage a point PERIOD The side of her face only inches away from the hard surface was uninjured and popped right back up and finished the match PERIOD

Junior Magali Holt who has not seen action all season filled in for Giuletta Boha as she could not shake off the rust falling to a   loss in her  debut PERIOD

The Panthers play host to the Fresno State Bulldogs April sixth where the Bulldogs look to avenge their  loss to FIU back on January twenty-seventh PERIOD The match is set for a  p.m PERIOD start at the FIU Tennis Center PERIOD
