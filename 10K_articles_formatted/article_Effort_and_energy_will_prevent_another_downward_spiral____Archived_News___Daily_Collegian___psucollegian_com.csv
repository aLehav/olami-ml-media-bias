Julie Reis is a sophomore majoring in telecommunications and a Collegian field hockey writer PERIOD Her email address is jgr145psu.edu PERIOD

My Opinion

Its a phenomenon known as dj vu PERIOD

No this isnt a plug for the new Denzel Washington movie PERIOD Rather its a phenomenon that the Penn State field hockey team is working its hardest to avoid PERIOD

Last year Penn State lost its first game went on a 17game winning streak and suffered its second loss in the last game of the regular season PERIOD It then went on to lose in the first rounds of both the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments PERIOD

This years No PERIOD  Nittany Lions lost their first two games went on a 10game winning streak and lost their last regular season game on Sunday against Indiana PERIOD There was one loss toward the end of the season but thats one of the few exceptions when the results from both seasons are compared PERIOD

For the players the way to separate themselves from last years fate is simple Energy PERIOD Last weekend the lack of fire was expressed on the players faces and in Penn State coach Char Moretts words PERIOD

 Morett said PERIOD 

Losing to Indiana and therefore losing out on the Big Ten championship was punishment enough for these players PERIOD They know what happened last year and they know it is up to them to change it PERIOD Anything less than a strong showing in the Big Ten tournament this weekend is unacceptable PERIOD

Now is the best time to prove to themselves and everybody else that the team that went to the tournaments last year will not be the same this time around PERIOD The desire is there and sidestepping a repeat of last year is motivation enough PERIOD

The Lions have not won a Big Ten tournament since   even more incentive PERIOD Every team in the tournament has a clear shot at winning the title but if Penn State comes out with its topgame it catapults itself to the top of that list

Coaches and players alike have seen the stellar play that the Lions are capable of and only a few extremely important factors need to be executed PERIOD More aggressiveness and competitiveness is all this team needs PERIOD Every loss this season can be attributed to a lack of effort energy or focus PERIOD

 Morett said PERIOD 

Everyone knows what happened last year PERIOD The players are trying their best to not think about it PERIOD But its there PERIOD Now they just need a new ending to their season so this trap door wont be there at the end of next year PERIOD

History is funny in that respect PERIOD You can either learn from it and make an improvement for next time or you can leave it unchanged and leave the turnaround for another time another season perhaps another team PERIOD

This years Lions have done a great job at improving from game to game PERIOD This weekend will give them the opportunity to improve from season to season and finally finish on a positive note PERIOD They can only get there with every players effort and energy PERIOD This weekend will show if the lesson is learned PERIOD
