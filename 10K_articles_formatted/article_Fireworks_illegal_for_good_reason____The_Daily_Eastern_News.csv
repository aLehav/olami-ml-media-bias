I literally have warm memories of the Fourth because as an accidentprone person I tend to get burnt when playing with fireworks PERIOD Most of the Fourths that I remember were spent in Minnesota where my mothers side of the family typically has their annual family reunion on our national holiday PERIOD



Some of the memories I associate are four wheeling ice cream making chilled watermelon smoked barbeque and of course fireworks PERIOD

Fireworks are a staple of the celebration of the Fourth of July and many kids have memories of smoke bombs fountains and sparklers or some of the more dangerous kinds like firecrackers bottle rockets and so forth PERIOD

Stories about people setting bottle rockets off in their hand and exploding roman candles sort of turned me away from the more explosive fireworks PERIOD Though I was still able to burn myself from sparklers a few times of all things PERIOD

Because of the risks involved with fireworks they are illegal here in Illinois PERIOD Some of the more kidfriendly ones like sparklers and smoke devices are still legal here but the more explosive ones are banned PERIOD Despite the ban in Illinois Indiana has fireworks for sale legally PERIOD The Indiana border is not that far of a drive from Charleston so anyone around here wishing to acquire illegal fireworks does not need to put in a whole lot of effort PERIOD

Im from Calumet City which is in the near south suburbs of Chicago and is also literally on the IllinoisIndiana boarder PERIOD Its basically a Calumet City tradition to take the threeminute drive to Indiana and go fireworks shopping to bring back home to celebrate the our nations independence PERIOD In recent years people running this errand to Indiana have fallen under increased scrutiny as municipal and state police patrol the border and may stop people they believe to be carrying illegal fireworks PERIOD

Something law enforcement does is patrol the parking lots for fireworks sellers and eye Illinois license plates in the parking lots PERIOD

Because of all this one begins to wonder why all the fuss over these explosive items PERIOD I dont find fireworks to be all that appealing anymore and I prefer to go to a city show rather than setting them off myself PERIOD For whatever reason kids love fireworks and they love to light them off themselves PERIOD The slight lack of safety is one of the reasons kids like fireworks PERIOD Since they like to light them off they partake in it and as a result injuries occur sometimes and to varying degrees PERIOD

Safety and common sense is key with fireworks PERIOD That message cant resonate with everyone but it doesnt hurt to talk about it PERIOD The truth is there are some people that handle fireworks intelligently and others who dont PERIOD Small children obviously shouldnt be allowed to handle fireworks PERIOD Fireworks should be used away from people in a safe area PERIOD Going by simple common sense will allow most people to have a safe and happy Fourth of July PERIOD
