8915,2023-09-07,"as Swarthmore students returned to campus this past week for the start of classes they were greeted by temperatures reaching as high as  degrees and RealFeel temperatures peaking at  degrees according to Accuweather PERIOD To advise residents of the dangerous temperatures the National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for Southeastern Pennsylvania between Tuesday Sept PERIOD  and Thursday Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

For the  of Swarthmore students living on campus  have been forced to endure these extreme temperatures inside of their dormitories as only six of the  dormitories on campus are equipped with air conditioning PERIOD Heat waves are likely to become more frequent and intense in the coming years due to climate change PERIOD The college must face this fact put students health and wellbeing first and renovate residence halls to include more air conditioning and ventilation PERIOD

In preparation for this weeks heat wave the college provided students with one box fan for each room  notably not each resident  and air conditioning units in lounges within nonair conditioned residence halls PERIOD Nevertheless these measures have largely been ineffective for cooling down rooms PERIOD Several students have opted to sleep in their residence hall lounges to escape the poor ventilation in their rooms PERIOD Others have chosen to move in with their peers living in air conditioned halls PERIOD Some students who braved the heat chose to nap in libraries after sleepless nights in their rooms PERIOD

On Sept PERIOD  Area Coordinators emailed students regarding residents who took matters into their own hands by installing window air conditioning units in their rooms PERIOD The email stated that due to electrical circuit strains students are directed to turn in personal air conditioning units or remove them from campus PERIOD Those who do not comply may face disciplinary action for student conduct violations detailed in the student handbook PERIOD Threatening students with disciplinary action is not a viable solution PERIOD Students should not feel pressured to live in dangerously hot conditions at an institution with a prefinancial aid cost of attendance exceeding  per year PERIOD Furthermore it is wrong for the administration to penalize students for fixing a problem that could and should have been prevented prior PERIOD

The growing concerns among students make it clear that the college has not done enough to protect students from the hazardous temperatures PERIOD Without support from the college this weeks heat wave has become intolerable for the majority of students living in poorly ventilated residence halls PERIOD

Moving back to school in the fall can be incredibly stressful especially for students traveling from far away or starting college for the first time PERIOD A students dorm room is virtually the only private area where they can destress and recharge PERIOD The college has a responsibility to ensure that all students living on campus have access to comfortable living spaces that are conducive to learning and destressing PERIOD Students should not be put at a disadvantage because of poor living conditions and outdated infrastructure PERIOD

It is no surprise that this weeks temperatures prompted changes in area school districts PERIOD In Pittsburgh where temperatures were lower than those in the Philadelphia area school districts closed school entirely PERIOD On Sept PERIOD  the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that this weeks heat wave is the longest September heat wave in Philadelphia since  leading more than  Philadelphiaarea schools without air conditioning to close early as educators feared that the heat would negatively impact students learning PERIOD

These fears are backed by countless studies showing that in schools heat negatively affects students learning academic performance and emotional wellbeing and that students living in homes without air conditioning are put at a disadvantage when they do not receive quality sleep PERIOD More broadly extreme heat can pose significant physical health risks to even the healthiest of individuals PERIOD

These physical and mental health risks are serious especially when considered alongside the stressors that Swarthmore students face daytoday PERIOD Amid the large expensive construction projects on campus  from the building of the geoexchange system to renovations on Martin Hall  the college cannot continue to ignore the dismal conditions in which students live every day and night and without providing immediate solutions the college cannot and should not punish students for desperately seeking solutions on their own PERIOD

Its time for Swarthmores Campus Renewal Program to include an immediate and necessary improvement to students quality of life safety and wellbeing the addition of air conditioning to all residence halls on campus PERIOD We recognize the significance of the colleges mission to achieve carbon neutrality but believe that with the implementation of energy efficient air conditioning systems it is possible to balance both environmental and human health concerns PERIOD In the short term Swarthmore cannot stay silent on this issue PERIOD Students deserve more proactive solutions PERIOD

Dont forget about the EVS workers who have to work in this heat

Finally someone said something PERIOD

The college has a responsibility to ensure that all students living on campus have access to comfortable living spaces that are conducive to learning and destressing

No that is not what you are owed PERIOD

You are entitled to adequate living spaces that do not threaten health and safety PERIOD Does the heat youve experience threaten the health of those who are otherwise healthy If Id attended Swarthmore back in the day I would have experienced   degree days my first year there according to NOAA data At the school I did attend I experienced  without air conditioning PERIOD For most the heat is discomfort  that can be tolerated not a health threat over a short period of time PERIOD

implementation of energy efficient air conditioning systems it is possible to balance both environmental and human health concerns PERIOD In the short term

Please do write an on this concept into a plan specific to Swarthmore PERIOD I believe in the possibility of solutions but there are always compromises when our common resources are allocated in a community PERIOD

Individually installed room air conditioners should not be rejected because of meanness however old electrical systems cannot tolerate them without significant upgrades PERIOD
