Penn State forward Bill Downey stripped a Drexel player of the puck just across the blueline causing the crowd to erupt in eager anticipation of the solid scoring chance to come PERIOD Reading the play defenseman Eric Harbaugh burst up ice joining Downey on a twoonone break PERIOD

After a perfect behindtheback pass and a quick shot that squeaked under Drexel goalie Dan Angelines glove as he dropped into his butterfly position the No PERIOD  Penn State ACHA Div PERIOD I Icers  sat on a  lead over the No PERIOD  Drexel Dragons  PERIOD

More shocking than the fact that this goal came from a defensiveminded player suiting up for just his second weekend of play since returning from an injury was the fact that it was shorthanded PERIOD

 Penn State Icers head coach Joe Battista said PERIOD 

Penn State defensemen contributing on the offensive end of the ice seemed to be a common theme this weekend as they scored four of the Icers  goals and added six more assists PERIOD

The Icers watched game tape last week and found a weakness in Drexels defense making a game plan to exploit it PERIOD

 Battista said PERIOD 

Joe Maglaque stepped up on defense for the Icers scoring half of the defensemens points with three goals and two assists in the two games against Drexel PERIOD Maglaque took advantage of the Dragons collapsing defense to fire open shots from the point PERIOD

This resulted in two powerplay goals and a powerplay assist when forward Kevin Jaeger banged in a rebound off of a Maglaque shot PERIOD

Harbaugh said Drexel was supposed to be playing a diamond or a onetwoone defense on the power play but instead set up in a box or twotwo defense PERIOD He said this defensive set up gave the Icers point player on their umbrella power play unit a onetwotwo offense many open shot opportunities PERIOD

Maglaque used his overpowering wrist shot from the point to score his three goals this weekend PERIOD With no Drexel players around him he was able to set up and pick an open spot in the net to shoot at PERIOD

 Maglaque said PERIOD 

Other defensemen helping out in the offensive zone were junior Chris Rome with two assists and both Matt Wallace and Drew Ward who added an assist each PERIOD

Even with all of the scoring the forwards provide for the Icers it never hurts to have the defensemen chipping in PERIOD

 Battista said PERIOD
