6221,2023-10-08,"an unusually frigid November morning and my own dubiously graceful antics recently conspired to sideline me for the better part of a week PERIOD After my lazy attempt to exit my bed ended up in a painfully strained back I laid around in a dolorous stupor and promised myself to be grateful for every day my body worked normally PERIOD Yet the moment my back returned to its untroubled state I forgot all about it again PERIOD

I can take some comfort in the fact that such apathy is not entirely my fault PERIOD My indifference to the comforts Im used to is an example of a behavioral mechanism called latent inhibition first discovered in  by R.E PERIOD Lubow and A.U PERIOD Moore PERIOD Our brains take the massive amount of sensory input we receive on a continual basis and automatically filter out all the stuff that we have already processed and deemed irrelevant PERIOD We rapidly grow accustomed to various persistent environmental stimuli and tune them out so that our brains dont have to struggle with handling multiple sensations at once PERIOD

This ability conferred a survival advantage when our homo erectus ancestors were skulking about in the bushes stalking prey it was helpful not to have been distracted by the minute perceptions of hovering insects or poky dirt underfoot PERIOD Further down the evolutionary timeline we also find latent inhibition useful PERIOD If we have a particularly smelly roommate its helpful if were able to block out the odors after a while PERIOD And when were taking an exam we dont want to constantly feel our sleeves tickling our arms our body focuses accordingly on the task at hand and desensitizes us to all the other inconsequential ambient sensations PERIOD

Unfortunately this typically helpful ability can be a bit problematic when we start ignoring things wholesale PERIOD Latent inhibition is a notorious saboteur of human relationships  when we get used to the presence and kindness of those close to us we take them for granted despite their qualities PERIOD As most of us have experienced at one point or another were apt to get bored and end up seeking new people PERIOD

Similarly were bound to overlook the things in life that we are fortunate to have PERIOD I was overjoyed and overcome with gratitude when I got my laptop for my birthday four years ago but it rarely elicits the faintest thought anymore as to how privileged I am to have it PERIOD If it were to get lost I would be heartbroken PERIOD But until then it usually falls out of my consciousness PERIOD The same goes for every comfort and privilege we enjoy that others dont  its only when theyve disappeared that it might strike us how lucky we are PERIOD

Its rather impossible to be perpetually thankful when our possessions physical and intangible number in the hundreds PERIOD Were hardly going to profess our appreciation of shoelaces or phone chargers PERIOD But we can still keep our most valuable possessions close to our hearts PERIOD Trust me  Ive had the same lovably faded grey teddy bear for  years PERIOD
