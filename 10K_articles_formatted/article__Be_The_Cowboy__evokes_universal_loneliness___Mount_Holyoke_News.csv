Mitskis fifth studio album Be The Cowboy conveys poignant emotions through catchy tracks PERIOD

BY EMILY ROLESFOTSO 

Indie rock singersongwriter Mitski Miyawaki mononymously known as Mitski released her highly anticipated fifth studio album Be the Cowboy this summer to the delight of critics and fans alike PERIOD Catapulted into stardom after the successful release of her  album Bury Me at Makeout Creek Mitski has become renowned for lyrics that ache with such vulnerability that they have garnered her an indie cult following PERIOD Though that same raw emotion bleeds through every lyric on Be the Cowboy Mitski emphasizes the difference between herself and the person she sings about in her music on the album a distinction she feels has been overlooked in the past. in an interview with Pitchfork she denounced the way many people compare her music to emotional diary entries failing to acknowledge the effort and skill that go into composition PERIOD Thats so gendered PERIOD Theres no feeling of Oh maybe shes a songwriter and she wrote this as a piece of art said Mitski PERIOD

Be the Cowboy is composed of  artfully crafted tracks each under four minutes that feature characters with lives that sometimes differ from her own but which conjure emotions relatable to anyone who has experienced love and loss. each song is its own unique story but together they illustrate the dizzying complicated nature of human connection PERIOD

The opening track Geyser is an intense eruption that crackles with longing Mitski sings I will be the one you needI just cant be without you over wailing guitars only to transition into Why Didnt You Stop Me a more upbeat piece that flirts with feelings of regret and dependency over a synth pop beat contrasting the open and vulnerable track that precedes it with a deceivingly unaffected faade PERIOD Nobody is a manic descent into madness set over a disco beat. the desire to dance carelessly around the room as Mitski sings Nobody nobody nobody until it no longer sounds like a word or as she begs for one good honest kiss to stave off isolation displays the paradox behind the albums sense of cultivated vulnerability PERIOD

One of the strongest tracks on the album A Pearl captures the complicated pain that comes when you carry wounds that have not healed into a new relationship. sorry I dont want your touchits not that I dont want you Mitskis character sings desperately trying to reassure her lover before building to a roaring climax Its just that I fell in love with a warand nobody told me it ended. in Remember My Name Mitski writes about the desire to leave a mark on the world perfectly capturing the desperate ambition of early adulthood and the constant fear of being forgotten singing Just how many stars will I have to hang around me to finally call it heaven

From the emotional effectiveness of Mitskis poetic lyrics and passionate sound it is hard to believe that it is not her living these  lives she is somehow simultaneously the aging exlovers reminiscing on their youth in the quiet ballad Two Slow Dancers and the committed wife who feels trapped in Me and My Husband. pieces of Mitski live in each of these characters weaving their ways through the lines of her carefully crafted masterpiece and leaving behind an album that touches on parts of the human experience that often feel isolating but are as she reveals universal PERIOD Maybe Im the same as all those menWriting songs of all their dreaming Mitski muses fearing that her art could be derivative or mediocre PERIOD Be the Cowboy shows us that this couldnt be further from the truth PERIOD
