Students and administrators created the Social Life Task Force in response to the moratorium on dances last fall PERIOD The group aims to expand the variety of social activities available to a frustrated student body including smaller oncampus events and schoolsanctioned offcampus parties PERIOD

Undeclared task force member Jamie Stevenson sophomore emailed Director of Student Life Tamara Rice at the beginning of this semester eager to change the current social conditions PERIOD He stressed students dissatisfaction with the colleges social environment since the implementation of the dance ban PERIOD

Theres definitely been a lot of complaining from the student body PERIOD People arent happy about it PERIOD Im not happy about it PERIOD But I do see why Rice did that Stevenson said PERIOD

Rice announced the dance ban after eight alcoholrelated transports at the Oct PERIOD  Toga dance PERIOD

I just wanted students to think differently about the social scene and to think differently about what we can do thats fun that a lot of people will enjoy but just not get too crazy Rice said PERIOD Yes there is a ban on dances PERIOD But theres not a ban on concerts or poetry nights or comedy shows or DJ show cases. there have been no transports associated with college events since Toga according to Rice PERIOD

The task force set a goal to reintroduce dances next September or October according to Stevenson PERIOD For now the task force is brainstorming new ideas for social events PERIOD Taking inspiration from the wellreceived Jan PERIOD 31Groove at the Glenhosted by KOXY the task force is optimistic about creating smaller more diverse social events on a more consistent basis PERIOD

Undeclared ASOC FirstYear Senator Mary Fulham volunteered to lead the task force and has been considering what kinds of events will interest students PERIOD

According to  Fulham and Stevenson prompting consistent diverse options on and off campus is the goal of the task force PERIOD Rice believes this will not be difficult given the colleges location in a major city PERIOD

The other thing is Its not like we live in Iowa PERIOD Were in Los Angeles And I know Bengal Bus does late night safe rides on the weekends and they have like a  mile radius PERIOD And  miles gets you pretty far into L.A. Rice said PERIOD

For students the cost of getting off campus is often a consideration in making plans and staying on campus is often easier according to Fulham PERIOD The task force aims to strike a balance between encouraging students to go out into Los Angeles and providing frequent programming oncampus PERIOD

I guess what I dont want is for students to be just be sitting on their laurels and going Woe is me and There just is no fun and my social life is terrible Rice said PERIOD

In addition to generating more events the task force is also considering how to allow house parties more breathing room by having houses register parties with Campus Safety PERIOD

What registering means is that the house will tell Campus Safety that we are having a party and it will go from  p.m PERIOD until  p.m PERIOD and Campus Safety will agree to shut down the party at  p.m. but we will let it go on until then PERIOD And ideally we could communicate that information with the residents of the house Rice Campus Safety and the residents of the neighborhood Stevenson said PERIOD

According to Rice making Occidental a school where alcohol related transports are rare if not nonexistent will require students to take ownership of their personal and shared experience at social events PERIOD
