Honoring the life of Silke Crombie

As a result of the recent lead poisoning crisis in Flint Michigan the issue of faulty water systems in the United States has become a hot topic PERIOD 
Last fall the Carolina Public Press hosted a panel discussion on the ownership of water rights in Western North Carolina PERIOD
Katie Hicks assistant director for Clean Water of North Carolina said she believes public awareness of water rights ownership can influence many other social issues as well PERIOD
Were working to have meaningful public involvement and decisions about water and environmental justice which is all communities have equal access to clean safe environments and building peoples power to change issues that are affecting them Hicks said PERIOD 
One of the most crucial issues that public officials are focusing on is the fact that many of the pipes in American water systems have not been updated since postWorld War I PERIOD 
The bulk of our system really the beginning of the core of our system came about in the 1920s Lee Smith utilities director of Hendersonville Water and Sewer said PERIOD So were dealing with some infrastructure that is approaching  years. in a report entitled Buried No Longer Confronting Americas Water Infrastructure Challenge the American Water Works Association found that in order to maintain a healthy level of drinking water service to the public the country would have to invest  trillion during the next  years PERIOD 
There is however another issue that is complicating the potential for a national water system restoration project and this is demonstrated clearly in the city of Asheville PERIOD 
In  House Bill  was passed removing control of the water system from the city and placing it under the hands of a regional authority PERIOD
The city has filed an appeal of this decision to the North Carolina Supreme Court hoping that there will be a ruling in favor of Asheville retaining ownership of the  customers inside and outside of its lines PERIOD The state announced in January that it agreed to hear the appeal and arguments will be subsequently be set in motion PERIOD 
One of the cases that makes the city of Asheville and some of North Carolinas water systems unique is that they have not switched over to private ownership as quickly as the rest of the country according to a report put out by the Clean Water of North Carolina entitled Privatizing North Carolinas Water Undermining Justice. according to the  CWFC report  percent of public water systems and  percent of community water systems in the U.S.are privately owned although  percent of the American population does not favor privatization PERIOD 
The issue of infrastructure is cited as one of the reasons so many public water systems have switched ownership to private companies PERIOD The report states many of these 
systems are unable to afford needed repairs and elected officials often lack the political will to raise rates to update spending costs PERIOD 
Despite this there have been and continue to be attempts to maintain state control of North Carolinas water systems with many infrastructure programs throughout the state being consolidated into the Division of Water Infrastructure in  PERIOD 
One of the things I really liked about the legislation was that it charged the State Water Infrastructure Authority with building a master plan for the states water infrastructure needs not just approving projects here and there but actually putting together a plan so that project approval and prioritization and how these programs all operate are really going to operate fully in concert with each other and in concert with the states needs said Kim Colson director of the N.C PERIOD Division of Water Infrastructure PERIOD 
A new study released by the CFNC The Stealthy Takeover of NC Drinking Water A Snapshot of Corporate Privatization shows how this insidious trend is becomingin North Carolina PERIOD
The two major privatelyowned utilities in North Carolina according to the study are Aqua NC and Utilities Inc PERIOD Aqua NC a subsidy of Aqua America owns and operates watersewer systems in more than  counties while Utilities Inc PERIOD owns  divisions in  counties PERIOD 
After the Division of Water Infrastructure was founded in  the NC Utilities Commission decided to cement a rulemaking process which allowed utilities like Aqua to forgo commenting on certain billing surcharges that allow rates to gradually increase according to the CFNC PERIOD
This builds on a  decision by the North Carolina Utilities Commission to create an acquisition incentive to encourage Aqua NC to buy rural and suburban water systems which have fallen into disrepair and need upgrades PERIOD 
Although only . percent of Buncombe Countys population relies on privatelyowned community water systems according to the N.C PERIOD Department of Environment and National Resources there is evidence that those who do receive water from these companies are suffering economically PERIOD 
When these companies are mainly concerned about their bottom line they tend to cut on staff they tend to cut on how much maintenance they are able to doHicks said so in a lot of cases we do hear of a lot of problems and slow response times even while the rates are climbing. the Student Voice of UNC Asheville
