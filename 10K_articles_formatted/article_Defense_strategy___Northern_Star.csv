November  

Defense is based on a premise of aggresive killing of those whose governments hold opinions differing from ours said Ms PERIOD Raney in a letter to the editor advocating U.S demilitarization PERIOD

The alternative to having an adequate national defense would be to subject ourselves to what might be termed passive killing rather than aggresive killing. totalitarian governments whether communistic or facist disallow their citizens the freedoms we enjoy PERIOD Rather than tolerate criticisms these governments intern dissidents in labor camps passively killing them with poor nutrition and bitter working conditions or dissident citizens may simply be imprisoned with no recourse other than to ponder their crimes against the state in seclusion from family and friends PERIOD

Two studies will help illustrate why an adequate defense is necessary to preserve our freedom PERIOD

Osgood  proposed his Graduated and Reciprocated Initiatives in Tensionreduction GRIT strategy as a means by which the United States and the Soviet Union would decrease their nuclear arsenals PERIOD According to this plan the U.S PERIOD would announce a small unilateral concession and invite the USSR to reciprocate until the supply of weapons was depleted PERIOD This Osgood believed would promote trust between the superpowers PERIOD

The GRIT strategy has not been accepted however because the critical issue is verifiability not trust PERIOD Limitations agreed upon in peace accords are worth no more than the paper upon which they are written without the certainty provided by mutual verification PERIOD Osgoods method lacks this PERIOD

Pacifism is sometimes promoted as the means by which we can achieve peace PERIOD Shure Meeker and Hansford  demonstrated that passive resistance is quite ineffective PERIOD In this study participants were blocked from their goal by passive resistance PERIOD Of the  participants who met with pacifism   percent exploited the pacifist PERIOD Too many conditions must be met in order for pacifism to be consistently effective strategy PERIOD

I desire to live in a world free from violence and the threat of annihilation PERIOD The means to obtain this goal is not pacifism as Shure Meeker and Hansford indicate nor is it unilateral disarmament PERIOD Negotiations which include measures for the verifiability of compliance with the accords offer a level of certainty to both superpowers which is unobtainable by pacifism or unilateral disarmament PERIOD
