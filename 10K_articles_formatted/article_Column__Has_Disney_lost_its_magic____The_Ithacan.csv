6864,2023-07-26,"during a company earnings call for the yearend  quarter Feb PERIOD  Disney CEO Bob Iger  announced that the company would be laying off  employees roughly  of its entire workforce PERIOD This is one of the most significant job cuts in the companys 100year history PERIOD

The news of these layoffs should have been the talk of the entertainment industry if for nothing besides the unfortunate and abrupt nature of their announcement PERIOD However it was drowned out less than one hour later during the same February earnings call when Iger announced that the studio would be developing sequels to three of some of its most popular intellectual properties Toy Story Frozen and Zootopia. this news immediately set social media ablaze PERIOD While people had their attention geared toward debating on Twitter whether Disney and Pixar must make yet another entry in the Toy Story franchise it almost seemed as though the announcement about the layoffs did not even happen  no one was talking about it PERIOD

It is not a coincidence that Iger chose to make the sequel announcements shortly after the announcement about the layoffs during the company earnings call PERIOD It was a direct attempt to distract from the larger issue at hand which is that Disney like many other studios and tech companies in the current media landscape is currently in a more vulnerable position than it has been in years PERIOD

When Iger stepped down as Disney CEO and handed the reins over to Bob Chapek in February  the companys stock price was worth roughly  per share PERIOD Less than one month later the companys stock price naturally plummeted to about  per share  the lowest it had been since   thanks to the onset of the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD One year later in March  the companys stock was the highest it had ever been at about  per share PERIOD Disney was thriving and the theme parks were gearing up to reopen after over a year of being shut down PERIOD

Since Disneys stock peaked in  it began to only steadily decrease for a variety of reasons most of them stemming from Chapeks incompetence as CEO PERIOD Investors and the general public were beginning to lose faith in the company and resent Chapek PERIOD Even Iger communicated to people close to him that he felt as though Disney was losing its soul PERIOD

Chapek was essentially taking everything that Iger built over his  years as CEO and tearing it apart PERIOD All of the healthy relationships that Iger had formed with creatives were being dismantled whether it was through the very public Scarlett Johansson lawsuit or the censoring of LGBTQ representation in Pixar films PERIOD No one was happy especially not customers of Disneys theme parks which at every turn seemed to raise their prices and simply make it more difficult to have enjoyable experiences at any of them PERIOD

As a result of all of Chapeks blunders Disneys stock fell back down to roughly  in December  almost exactly where it was at the beginning of the pandemic PERIOD Luckily mere weeks before this occurred the companys board of executives decided to get its act together and boot Chapek from the company in favor of bringing back Iger for a twoyear term to course correct PERIOD

Instantly upon Igers return the damage wrought by Chapek began to dissipate PERIOD Iger reshuffled Disneys media and entertainment division getting rid of suits like Kareem Daniel who under Chapek took away much of the input that creatives at Pixar Marvel Lucasfilm and Disneys other studios grew accustomed to having during decisionmaking processes PERIOD Under Daniel Disneys pipeline seemed to shift in prioritization from a qualityoverquantity standard to the reverse PERIOD

The intense and heavy mandate placed in front of Disneys studios with particular emphasis on Marvel to develop more projects each year explains the lack of quality in some of their most recent work like Thor Love and Thunder  and AntMan and the Wasp Quantumania  PERIOD This can best be seen in the visual effects work of both Marvels films and shows PERIOD Over the last few years underpaid visual effects companies working for Marvel have been forced to meet unrealistically short deadlines and prioritize some projects over others to keep up with the dramatically increased studio slate PERIOD

Iger has noticed these qualms and taken action by mandating in February a decrease in the output of the companys most lucrative studios including Marvel and Lucasfilm PERIOD With the decreased demand Marvel chief Kevin Feige and Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy should have more control over the quality of their projects PERIOD As a bonus the visual effects teams charged with bringing their projects to life will also have more time to make them look the best PERIOD

While Disney stock began to increase as Iger started making some of these decisions he recognized that more would have to be done to bring shareholders and executives back on board and to increase levels of enthusiasm to where they were in  and before the pandemic PERIOD One way to do this is to leverage the companys existing popular IPs and bring them back into the fold with announcements of new projects PERIOD He also recognized that sacrifices would be necessary to aid the company in gaining more capital hence the layoffs PERIOD

It was an inspired move by Iger to announce three groundshaking projects for billiondollar franchises at the companys earnings call to drive home the message that he has returned to the company to bring back quality and profits PERIOD However he should have had the foresight to recognize that doing so mere moments after announcing the layoffs of thousands would seem a tad insensitive PERIOD Peoples livelihoods at stake are more important than the companys next big billiondollar project PERIOD While these types of projects and their successes help keep Iger from having to make difficult decisions like the one that he had to announce during the earnings call he should have known better than to toss seven thousand people aside and make it feel like a victory PERIOD It is just as great a defeat for Disney as it is for every single one of the employees who are affected by the layoffs PERIOD
