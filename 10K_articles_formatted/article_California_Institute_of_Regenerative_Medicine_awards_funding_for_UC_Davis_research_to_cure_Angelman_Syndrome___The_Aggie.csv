Angelman Syndrome is a rare neurogenetic condition that leads to developmental delays and motor and speech impairments



The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine CIRM recently awarded David Segal a professor from the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at the UC Davis School of Medicine with the Discovery Stage Research Project DISC2 award for his research on a rare neurogenetic disease called Angelman Syndrome PERIOD

CIRMs unique and competitive Quest Awards Program promotes the discovery of promising new stem cellbased and gene therapy technologies that could be translated to enable broad use and ultimately improve patient care according to their website PERIOD For Segal this grant is crucial in facilitating the translation of his research  along with the collaborative efforts of the labs of Jill Silverman and Kyle Fink  from the lab bench to the patient bedside for a disease with no current treatment in place PERIOD

Silverman a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UC Davis Mind Institute described the rarity of the Angelman Syndrome PERIOD

The Angelman Syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs in about one in  to  births Silverman said PERIOD When you combine them the overall effect becomes one in  PERIOD Altogether theyre not actually rare anymore theyre common PERIOD And the key is we just have to figure out one cure that we hope will be able to help. for a disease that is rare yet occurs frequently enough to demand attention Segal Silverman and Fink set out on the forefront of gene editing technology to find one cure that may pave the way for finding cures for other rare diseases PERIOD

Angelman Syndrome is a rare condition that leads to severe developmental decay motor impairments difficulty with ambulatory movements and emulation of speech due to the loss of ubiquitin ligase E3A UBE3A gene expression in the brain PERIOD To restore such gene expression Segal and his colleagues are employing a cousin of the CRISPRCas9 gene editing technique widely used in mouse models to be translated in clinical therapy PERIOD

We are using a member of the CRISPRCas family and many people have heard of CRISPRCas protein as a nuclease that edits DNA and thats mostly done with the socalled Cas9 proteins Segal said PERIOD Were using a cousin of that the Cas13 and instead of working on the DNA it looks to target a piece of RNA PERIOD Theres an RNA thats kind of holding that gene back from being expressed so if we could target that RNA with the Cas13 we think that UBE3A can then be turned on and expressed in the brain. fink is an assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Neurology and his lab specializes in translating what Silverman and Segal test in mouse models into usable technology in potential clinical trials PERIOD Testing the gene editing approach Segal has delved into Fink is working with pluripotent stem cells to be turned into neurons for patients with the Angelman Syndrome PERIOD

Weve been working with the stem cells for a while and understanding the duration of how long we have to maintain them and what are the necessary factors to push them into neurons Fink said PERIOD

Segal expressed gratitude for a grant that is difficult to come by the . million which the three labs are trying to receive in order to fund the Angelman Syndrome project PERIOD

CIRM is a special resource that we have here in California that just really supports stem cell research Segal said PERIOD In this latest version they are also supporting gene therapy as well so theyre really focused on translating these kinds of molecular research and molecular therapies to treating diseases in California and across the world PERIOD We applied to that and were ranked as the top grant in the state in that category across over  grants. the future for Angelman Syndrome and gene editing technology is ever evolving PERIOD Silverman echoed these sentiments in her work with her colleagues as an opportunity to inspire other companies and researchers to support research for rare diseases like Angelman Syndrome PERIOD

The idea and enthusiasm around gene editing and genebased therapies and stem cellbased therapies is that we sort of just need one success story Silverman said PERIOD Things arent so easy as copypaste or copy and replace but if  were able to get one which we have one molecular therapy now in a clinical trial thats a success story for one rare disease PERIOD Therell be one in  people as opposed to one in  people PERIOD And that paves the way for all rare disorders and many neurodevelopmental disorders. written by Brandon Nguyen  sciencetheaggie.org
