7677,1970-01-01,"when Oregon head strength and conditioning coach Jim Radcliffe agreed to a handshake agreement with Oregon Track Club Elite coach Frank Gagliano last year to train some of his athletes Gagliano asked what he charged PERIOD

Radcliffes terms were simple If they make the Olympics I want to go PERIOD

Last week he got that chance spending a few days at the high performance training center in Dalian an hour outside Beijing PERIOD A year after he began teaching OTC Elite athletes Nicole Teter Lauren Fleshman Nick Symmonds Cack Ferrell and Tom Brooks warmup routines core strength workouts and eventspecific strength regimens Radcliffe made the trip with Symmonds PERIOD Because of food poisoning and illness Teter was forced to spend most of her time before her  meter competition at the Olympic Village in Beijing PERIOD

It was the culmination of a learning experience for both the athletes and the coach PERIOD

It was pretty neat Radcliffe said PERIOD I havent been a real distance running aficionado Ive always been with sprinters and jumpers so Ive learned a whole lot this whole year. smith and Wheating did not advance past the first round while Symmonds failed to make the  final yesterday PERIOD

The relationship began when Oregon director of track and field Vin Lananna approached Radcliffe last summer about working with postcollegiate athletes PERIOD He began working with Teter and Fleshman first which paved the way for Gagliano  nicknamed Gags  to ask about working with Symmonds the  U.S PERIOD  meter champion PERIOD

Of course being post collegians and having to pay for most things they get they asked me what I charged Radcliffe said PERIOD I said well you make it to the Olympics I want to be a part of that to. security reasons kept Radcliffe from being able to train the runners in Beijing so he returned earlier this week when Symmonds OTC Elite  meter runner Christian Smith and Oregon sophomore Andrew Wheating  who all qualified in the  for the U.S PERIOD  went to Beijing and the Olympic Village PERIOD By Monday he was back in Eugene in time for  a.m PERIOD football practice PERIOD

He was disappointed to not watch them run in person but understood it was unavoidable PERIOD

Its like I was telling the football coaches its like coaching Monday through Friday but not going into the stadium on Saturday for the game Radcliffe said PERIOD But I still enjoy the Monday through Friday part. an Oregon strength coach for  years Radcliffe was courted by OTC Elite to show the athletes how to warm up more efficiently before races as well as emphasizing core strength routines and flexibility and mobility PERIOD He would typically meet with Symmonds two to three times a week around nine in the morning for their sessions together PERIOD

He realized quickly how much it meant to the athletes many of whom had never been through such training PERIOD

I found out is that it was a lot more meaningful to them because it wasnt something they had to do it was actually a privilege he said PERIOD I never had to worry about them being on time or not showing up or not being accountable. it was the first time Radcliffe had been to China after traveling to Korea twice and Japan four times PERIOD

Although Gagliano will not return as OTC Elite coach next season because of family health problems Symmonds told Radcliffe he wants him as a coach for as long as he runs which Radcliffe said hes agreed to on another handshake deal PERIOD
