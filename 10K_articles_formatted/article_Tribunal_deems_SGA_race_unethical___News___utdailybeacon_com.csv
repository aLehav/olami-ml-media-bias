Student Government Association elections have ended but the question of what is a  victory and what is a  victory remains unresolved by a Student Tribunal decision released this week PERIOD

On Monday April  the Student Tribunal heard a challenge to the validity of the SGA election from campus political parties Student Action and Team Tennessee acting as joint petitioners against Tennessee Now PERIOD

The tribunal ruled the results of the SGA elections would stand despite finding  brought forth in a challenge to the election results by two parties involved PERIOD Because of restrictions on its jurisdiction the tribunal was unable to act further in this matter PERIOD

However the university uses several measures that should ensure clean ethical campaigns are run PERIOD

Every year the SGA publishes an election packet that outlines proper guidelines for conducting a campaign PERIOD If there is a violation of procedure the SGA Ethics Committee is in place to discipline those who break the rules PERIOD

If a closer look is required at questionable action then the Student Tribunal is available to review ethics violations and election results PERIOD

Consequently in this trial the Student Tribunal was limited in its review to determining whether a  occurred that would have affected the election results PERIOD

The tribunal heard six charges against Tennessee Now and considered the first two charges involving an email sent by Vice President Ben Sanders and solicitation of students at Morrill Hall by Tennessee Now Communications Director Zac Wright to be irregularities PERIOD

The election results will stand because the tribunal who could make a decision  said both the email and solicitations 

The tribunal did say however the ethical charges brought forth were  but they were unable to render a decision on any ethical issues because of its limited jurisdiction PERIOD

The first charge was levied against Sanders and concerned an email he sent via a massmailing list to all College of Agriculture students under the name of junior student Ella Brown PERIOD The email appeals to agriculture students to vote for 

It continues saying  The email then encourages students to vote not at web.utk.edusga but at www.tennesseenow.org PERIOD

Sanders later sent out another email clarifying that  He also apologized to the 

Concerning the email the Student Tribunal said Sanders 

Sanders responded to the charges saying he was The bottom line is that there were no rules broken PERIOD This case was nothing more than an attempt to contort actions to make them seem illegal PERIOD It was a flimsy attempt to deal with personal disappointment in the out come of the election PERIOD

 Sanders said PERIOD

As for the allegations against Wright the tribunal said that while his solicitation outside of Morrill Hall was not an infraction his direct assistance with voting at the lobby computer while wearing a Tennessee Now Tshirt is an 

Although Wright did not  any rules the tribunal felt that Wright had enough SGA experience to recognize that he was in violation of voter privacy and confidentiality at a public computer PERIOD

 Wright said PERIOD

 Wright said PERIOD

Bryan Coker director of student judicial affairs who presided over the tribunal said that concerns were put forth regarding the actions of Student Action and Team Tennessee but that the tribunal 

After the ruling Student Action and Team Tennessee expressed disappointment in the tribunal not being able to do more PERIOD

 Chris Dollar Student Action presidential candidate said PERIOD 

Aaron Lay Team Tennessee presidential candidate said that the decision will help I believe this opinion will let students know how several members of Tennessee Now conducted themselves throughout the campaignI feel that the limitations put on the tribunal were too restraining PERIOD Due to this I feel we received some form of justice when they issued the opinion PERIOD The opinion clearly lays out why they could not take further action because it was not in their powerThe tribunal pointed out that this should have gone before the ethics committee first PERIOD Instead we were told it had to go to the tribunalThats a valid question PERIOD

My understanding is that before the election this was brought to the attention of the Ethics Committee PERIOD However there was not a formal complaint PERIOD The Ethics Committee felt that to move forward with it they had to have a formal complaint and no complaint was filed.They Student Action and Team Tennessee never turned in a formal appeal until after the election PERIOD I was under the impression that I did not have jurisdiction over the appeal because it was going directly to tribunalI think the tribunal had an issue with the fact that maybe it could have been dealt with earlier in the weekThe ethics committee investigated the email and we found that the rules in the packet were too ambiguous for us to make any type of decisionWe read over a lot of material and we wanted to make sure we did our job PERIOD We didnt see anywhere in election packet that he specifically violatedWe only have the ability to go over issues that are covered in the election packet.if you look in the packet you must follow rules of OIT Office of Information Technology regulations for UTs mail system PERIOD We looked at the acceptable users policy PERIOD We could not find a clear rule that Ben violated PERIOD

 Bradley said PERIOD 

The consensus between both the Student Tribunal and Bradley was that the SGA election packet was unable to effectively address this issue PERIOD

 the Student Tribunal decision stated PERIOD

Bradley said she agrees with that assessment PERIOD She feels that certain issues need to be addressed by the election packet in the future PERIOD

 Bradley said PERIOD

Lay and Dollar echoed the sentiments of Bradley and the Student Tribunal PERIOD They feel that one of the issues needing to be addressed are the deadlines for appeals PERIOD

The deadline for appealing the election results to the tribunal is  p.m PERIOD April  election results were released around  p.m PERIOD April  PERIOD

 Lay said PERIOD
