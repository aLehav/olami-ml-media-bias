Leonard Floyd

Leonard Floyd outside linebacker for the Los Angeles Rams understands that the atmosphere and expectations are both different heading into the  season as the defending champions PERIOD

Its very different because coming in we have a target on our back this year Floyd said during a press conference hosted by the Rams on June  PERIOD We gotta make sure we come every game knowing that weve got to put our best efforts out there. floyd serves as a leader on one of the best defenses in the NFL alongside other prominent defenders such as unanimous AllPro selection Aaron Donald PERIOD He is satisfied with how his name is mentioned with players such as Donald and how other players look to play alongside him as one of the perennial defenders in the league PERIOD

It makes me feel good man Floyd said who played with Georgia from  to  PERIOD Its hard work because I come in and I make sure that I show my hard work to the guys that come in how to get the job done everyday and how to make plays for the team. dAndre Swift

In his sophomore campaign with the Detroit Lions DAndre Swift increased his production in almost every statistic from his rookie season accumulating  yards from scrimmage and scoring seven touchdowns last year PERIOD

Headed into his third season in the pros Swift looks to continue to grow in all aspects in the backfield this offseason PERIOD

Im really critical of myself Swift said during a press conference hosted by the Lions on April  PERIOD I could always be more patient fall forward run behind my offensive line better routerun and be more crisp PERIOD A lot of little details that I could work on and take my game to the next level. swift will have the opportunity to increase his production with a healthier and more experienced offensive line this season PERIOD

Quay Walker

 first round draft pick Quay Walker has had a great first impression of the Packers since joining the team in April PERIOD

Im loving it so far Walker said in a press conference at the start of rookie minicamp PERIOD Its everything I planned for it to be PERIOD Im still getting used to it as I try to learn my way around PERIOD Overall I love it  It feels like home already. according to Walker the transition from college to the pros is the same as the transition from high school to college PERIOD

Moreover he said that his time at Georgia adequately prepared him for play in the NFL as he gets adjusted PERIOD After speaking with former Georgia teammate and current Green Bay teammate Eric Stokes he realized that many of the defensive tactics and other details are the same outside of terminology and other small tidbits PERIOD

Lewis Cine

Lewis Cine the last of Georgias five first round draft picks has had his expectations met thus far in his career with the Minnesota Vikings PERIOD

The biggest transition that Cine has made since joining the league has been adjusting to the speed of the game as opposed to that at the college level PERIOD

Offenses are way faster Cine said at a press conference hosted by the Vikings on June  PERIOD Ive seen that in my first couple weeks here but its starting to slow down for me because Im starting to think fast too. this is a testament to not only the preparation that Georgia provides its players but also the training and mentorship that the Vikings veterans have shown Cine PERIOD
