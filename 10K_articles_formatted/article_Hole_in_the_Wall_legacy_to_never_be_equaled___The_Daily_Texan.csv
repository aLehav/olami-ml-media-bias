5965,2023-07-11,"tuesday marked the launch of the muchhyped muchdelayed opening of East Side Kings newest and first ever brickandmortar restaurant at the Hole in the Wall PERIOD This development no doubt has local foodies foaming at the mouth as revered Austin chef Paul Qui unveils new menu selections at the location PERIOD But in the midst of all the fanfare over dressedup ramen noodles and things that are hard to pronounce it is easy to overlook the lost crowning culinary gem of the Drag the Hole Burger PERIOD

It has been months upon months since Ive enjoyed the greasy cuisine at if not my favorite then certainly the most conveniently located watering hole that I frequent PERIOD Many an ill spirit have I nursed back to health with a basket of salty fried okra washed down with a cold Lone Star PERIOD Nothing quite cured the I just bombed that exam blues better than a pitcher and the Tuesday buyonegetone burger special shared with my sweetie PERIOD The pains of a long and frustrating closing shift at my nearby retail job were blissfully whisked away by quesosmothered tater tots split with coworkers PERIOD

No longer PERIOD

Like a fleeting lover one day I awoke to find that it was all gone PERIOD Never to be heard from again PERIOD No goodbye no parting words no promise to reunite someday PERIOD Heartbreak ensued PERIOD I have searched high and low to find a burger to fill the void but all lack the perfect formula of taste location laidback atmosphere and budgetfriendliness offered by the Hole dining experience PERIOD My efforts have been in vain nobody utilizes bacon salt quite like the Hole in the Wall chefs PERIOD

My hope was briefly rekindled when I caught wind of rumors that food would be reappearing at Hole but was extinguished again when murals touting East Side King showed up on the buildings south wall PERIOD I had never actually tried the food from the trailers of the same name parked behind a handful of hip East Sixth Street dive bars so I had no negative opinion about the food PERIOD Yet somehow I couldnt get excited about the new arrival PERIOD Maybe my tastes arent refined enough to crave crafty Asianinspired street food while Im drinking cheap domestic beer by the pitcher and listening to the Rolling Stones on the jukebox PERIOD

Upon examination of the menu of the newest location my doubt remains PERIOD It features a sampling of just about everything I never wanted to try as a kid including Brussels sprouts beets and squid ink plus a slew of other ingredients that arent bacon salt or queso PERIOD If I wanted bean sprouts and cucumber kimchi Id turn to Whole Foods not Hole food PERIOD For  you can delight in what college students have been stockpiling for pennies on the dollar since their parents cut them off  ramen noodles PERIOD Granted unless you have some fukujinzuke or benishoga on reserve in your kitchen your ramen will likely pale in comparison PERIOD Nothing a little Sriracha sauce cant fix right But if you take advantage of happy hour or other drink specials you might save enough money to splurge on the noodles PERIOD

Will I try Holes newest offerings Eventually PERIOD Will I like it Maybe I will PERIOD Will I ever admit to liking it Unlikely unless I can get some bacon salt on thosefried beets PERIOD
