Rick Smiths Jan PERIOD  letter contains numerous errors which prompted me to write PERIOD

One fundamental error is his underlying assumption that our economic system allocates resources based on individual productivity PERIOD This is a fantasy PERIOD

Does he really think that an  million per year professional baseball player is  times more productive than a  per year science teacher

More to the point does Mr PERIOD Smith really believe that it is our capitalist system and not our government that is responsible for America having the best health care system in the world

He states that without profits of insurance and pharmaceutical companies there would be no research PERIOD Medical research in this country is primarily funded by the taxpayers through the National Institutes of Health to the tune of  billion this year alone PERIOD There is a hospital within a  minutes drive of every American built with taxpayer funds PERIOD Roughly half of the operating funds for these hospitals come from Medicare and Medicaid payments taxpayer funds without which these hospitals would shut down PERIOD

Taxpayers also heavily subsidize the nations medical schools PERIOD We have an excellent health care system because of ongoing taxpayer investment PERIOD Given this why should only some taxpayers be allowed access to it as Mr PERIOD Smith advocates I suggest that Mr PERIOD Smith spend a little more time on history and economics PERIOD
