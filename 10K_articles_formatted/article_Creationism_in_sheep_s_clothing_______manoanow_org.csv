A federal judge heard arguments yesterday concerning a lawsuit
in which eleven parents are suing the school board for introducing
an alternative to the theory of evolution into Pennsylvania
schools PERIOD The alternative theory is called intelligent design. this theory has been part of the Pennsylvania schools
curriculum for about a year now PERIOD Proponents of intelligent design
argue that the structure of life on earth is too advanced to have
evolved through natural selection challenging a core theory in
Darwins book  a widely accepted
scientific text PERIOD

Instead intelligent design supporters claim that life is the
result of intervention by an intelligent agent. the intelligent
design statement that teachers in Dover Penn. were instructed to
read to their students states 

What the intelligent design statement fails to note is that
specific things pertaining to Darwins theory have indeed been
proven as fact PERIOD But unlike Darwins theory the specific things
related to intelligent design such as the presence of an
intelligent agent have not been and cannot be proven without
introducing a faithbased perspective PERIOD The introduction of a
faithbased perspective in a classroom would blur the line of
separation of church and state PERIOD

Intelligent design sounds more and more like creationism in
sheeps clothing and holds no more scientific fact than the story
of Adam and Eve traipsing around the Garden of Eden PERIOD

It is fundamental for children to be presented different views
on how the universe came to be PERIOD It would be wrong to only expose
them to one view PERIOD However childrens parents and community church
leaders should be responsible for introducing arguments for
religious perspective on the origins of the universe PERIOD A science
teacher should not PERIOD

If children really feel cheated by learning only about the Big
Bang and Darwin in regards to the origins of the universe they
always have the option of taking religious electives or attending
churchbased schools PERIOD There are already plenty of outlets for
children to learn about intelligent design that do not take place
in public schools PERIOD

We will probably never know the true origins of life PERIOD However
evolution presents hard factual evidence about what happened after
life was set into motion PERIOD Intelligent design presents no factual
evidence whatsoever and has no basis in science PERIOD
