Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

DeKALB  After pitching the secondhalf shutout to clinch a victory against the Ohio University Bobcats in the one hundred and sixteenth annual Homecoming game NIUs defense collectively received Huskie Of the Week honors PERIOD

NIU faced a  deficit after conceding.. PERIOD

Looks can be deceiving is a good way to describe NIUs first MAC game of the season PERIOD While NIU   MAC trampled over Central Michigan   MAC at the end of the game defeating them  the two teams were separated by six points.. PERIOD

While the offensive statistics and display put forth by NIU against Central Michigan may seem more appealing what the defense was able to do trumps that PERIOD It was able to do something twice in this game that it only managed to do once in the other four.. PERIOD

Traditionally over the last couple of seasons NIU football has been known as an offensive juggernaut being able to score points seemingly at will PERIOD However after watching their season opener against Iowa the Huskies look like they are more of a defensive.. PERIOD

Two teams coming off completely opposite seasons will look to put a stamp on their first game of the year Saturday afternoon PERIOD In the history of NIU the Huskies will attempt to win their first game at Soldier Field PERIOD This contest will be played against.. PERIOD
