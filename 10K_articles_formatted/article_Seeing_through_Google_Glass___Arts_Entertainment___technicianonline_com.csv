Google began its crosscountry tour to introduce Google Glass to public consumers at the American Tobacco District in Durham Saturday PERIOD Hosted at Bay  Google Glass guides introduced the device which has garnered the worlds attention in the last year and a half PERIOD

When Google announced on Sept PERIOD  that the Triangle would be its first stop all  allotted spots were filled just days after the announcement was made PERIOD

Google first announced the Glass concept in April  and the company claimed it invented a glasseslike tool that would allow information and images to appear in the corner of the wearers eye PERIOD Some regarded it as the stuff of science fiction while others saw it as the future of technology PERIOD

When first put on the glasses dont appear to be functional PERIOD The blocky clear prism in the upper right corner distorts part of the users vision but its not until the user taps the glasses with one finger that the text comes into view PERIOD

The morning of the event long lines filled the American Tobacco Campus with people of all ages excited to try on the highly soughtafter technology PERIOD Google Glass guides showed attendees the various features of the product before they could try it on for themselves PERIOD

The product comes in five colors charcoal shale tangerine sky and cotton PERIOD Attendees had the opportunity to wrangle with the device and try the many features of Glass including searching the web by voice command searching for directions and taking photos and videos PERIOD

The company opened a contest in which users suggested uses for Glass with the best proposal winning early access for the affordable price of  PERIOD

Since that announcement Google has distributed Glass to  people which Google calls explorers. according to Emily Yudofsky product marketing manager at Google and a Google Glass guide explorers test the device during a period of time and provide critical feedback to the company PERIOD

Yudofsky said Google chose Durham because of Research Triangle Park and its growing reputation as a technology innovation hub PERIOD

Its a great place for us to let people try it its an amazing city Yudofsky said PERIOD We thought itd be an amazing place to start. last month Google announced that it had selected the American Underground an entrepreneurial technology incubator in Durham as one of the seven Google for Entrepreneur Tech Hubs around the United States PERIOD A Google for Entrepreneurs Tech Hub provides direct access to Google developers early access to Google Products and mentoring opportunities PERIOD

Devin Buell a program manager at Google X and Google Glass lead said Glass would be a paradigm shift in technology PERIOD

Glass is in the moment its designed that youre not having look down at the screen to access messages respond to email do a Google search Buell said PERIOD You no longer have to fish something out its there its instantaneous you could use it hands free so you dont have to type anything in and its a major shift of technology. buell said one of the challenges of designing Glass would be making people comfortable with the way it looked PERIOD

It was designed to be accessible but out of the way Buell said PERIOD You look at your phone its head down PERIOD What we want people to do is look up and experience the world but have all the same features you need PERIOD That was unique and how do you do that in a way thats accessible and that people are comfortable with

Jos Medrano a sophomore in physics said he was impressed with the depth of Glasss features PERIOD

Overall the entire event definitely showcased just what Glass could do Medrano said PERIOD I feel like either it or its successors will have a huge effect on how we interact with computers. medrano said he was particularly impressed with the builtin camera PERIOD

The camera on the device was without a doubt the fastest digital camera Ive ever used Medrano said PERIOD There was virtually no lag between my giving the command and the picture being taken. evan Holmes a sophomore in materials science and engineering said Glass voice commands were the most useful feature PERIOD

I feel the more you can resist using the touchpad on Glass the better the experience will be Holmes said PERIOD The trackpad is best suited for returning to the main OK Glass start page and sharing a picture you just took PERIOD As the voice commands develop I see the trackpad becoming less of a primary input for the device. though Glass is well out of the prototype stage Buell said there is still a lot of work to be done before Glass is ready for the real world PERIOD

We want to expand what were doing here and allow the public to interact with Glass more Buell said PERIOD There has been a lot of interest and open ended questions PERIOD So this was kind of the catalyst for that PERIOD Id say Durham was the start PERIOD Were not sure where were going to go next were excited to see where it takes us. google has not specified an exact public release date for Glass stating only that the product will be available to consumers sometime in  PERIOD
