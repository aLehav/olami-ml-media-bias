BACs along with GPAs were on the rise this Winter Term PERIOD For the first time classes were offered for course credit but the number of students transported to the Putnam County Hospital due to alcohol consumption spiked PERIOD

According to Dean of campus life Dorian Shager visits increased from one transport last Winter Term to seven this term PERIOD All of the students transported this Winter Term were firstyears PERIOD

The increases follow what Shager called the best start of the new school year DePauw has seen since the numbers were calculated PERIOD Winter Term proved to be a different story PERIOD

Within the last seven years an average of two DePauw students have been transported to the hospital due to suspected alcohol poisoning during Winter Term PERIOD The increase is both concerning and unclear to administrators plagued with the task of lowering highrisk drinking on campus PERIOD

The next step will be increasing programing and educational efforts second semester Shager said. we have an alcohol and drug oversight committee that will be delving into these numbers. another committee formed last year entitled BACdown made up of student leaders on campus from such organizations as IFC and Panhellenic Student Government as well as RAs and mentors will also research the numbers and discuss potential solutions PERIOD

Highrisk drinking is not a problem just on DePauws campus PERIOD According to the Newark Advocate covering Denison University a case of alcohol overdose occurs on average about once every two days that Denison is in session. the onus according to Fristyear resident assistant Craig Carter falls on the students PERIOD

I feel that RAs are doing their job PERIOD It is up to students to apply the knowledge they are given he said PERIOD Honestly the only way this is going to change is if there is a higher level of maturity among the student body PERIOD

Shager echoed similar sentiments PERIOD

DePauw students are at good calling for help when students need help he said PERIOD I think one of the things we need to do better is that students are cutting each other off earlier PERIOD

The problem is working the intervention in a socially accepted manner said Director of public safety Angie Nally PERIOD We want our entire community to be one of care PERIOD Even if youve never seen this person before and you see some kind of problematic thing thats starting to take place jump in and help. newsletter Signup
