The River Campus Medical Emergency Response Team is set to receive a  Jeep Grand Cherokee to help its members travel around campus PERIOD The car will be put into use next semester PERIOD The recent purchase was the result of over three years of petitioning by the MERT Executive Board PERIOD

In May  the Executive Board of MERT led by then Director of Operations Joshua Brown  submitted a 25page proposal requesting a vehicle in order to alleviate pressure on MERT members and help expand MERTs coverage across the River Campus and beyond PERIOD The issue was put off until January of this year when MERT pushed their proposal at a meeting attended by UR security University Health Services and other campus organizations PERIOD Finally in August of this year the car was approved and purchased at a discount price on a state contract PERIOD

This has been an ongoing project over the last three years Assistant Director of Operations and junior Brad Goldberg said PERIOD It was known at the time it was introduced that it was going to be a long process. the car is being paid for by UR security UHS and the College PERIOD It will have orange lights not red lights so that vehicles in front will not have to yield PERIOD

The vehicle will be expected to be operated in accordance with traffic laws and regulations including coming to full stops at stop signs in response to calls operating within lawful speed limits observance of lane markers  Director of University Security Walter Mauldin said PERIOD

Mauldin was very impressed with the MERT leadership over the last five years pointing to the high quality training and operational standards set by the organization PERIOD

When I had to talk to other University administration I was able to reassure them based on this wellestablished pattern of excellence and mature leadership he said PERIOD

The current administration of MERT is grateful for the effort that their predecessors put into getting the car PERIOD

We recognize the work of the past Executive Boards Director of Operations Daniel Nassau said PERIOD They were really the ones who made it happen. the new car will serve multiple purposes for MERT PERIOD The main function will be to transport MERT members across campus PERIOD Currently they have to walk from their room to the incident PERIOD

The May  proposal mentioned several instances when crew members were injured PERIOD On three separate occasions MERT members received injuries due to carrying their heavy equipment bags which according to the proposition can weigh  pounds with a full oxygen tank PERIOD On two occasions MERT members suffered injuries after slipping on ice PERIOD The car will provide speedy and safe transportation PERIOD

The car will also allow for the transport of equipment that MERT members cannot carry in their bags such as backboards splints and mechanical suction devices PERIOD

Well be able to carry almost all of the equipment equivalent to an ambulance Nassau said PERIOD

Another purpose that the car will serve is to expand the area that MERT can cover PERIOD As of now MERT receives around  calls for service a year and in the future they hope to be able to receive calls from outside the River Campus PERIOD

The car will allow MERT members to respond to emergency calls in Southside the hospital area graduate apartments and other offcampus housing PERIOD

Nassau is convinced that MERT provides quicker service than the  ambulance service contracted by the city of Rochester Rural Metro PERIOD

The average response time for MERT is six minutes he said PERIOD Metro on the other hand has a response time closer to  minutes PERIOD That difference can be huge. the new car will have a huge impact on MERT and its performance in times of crisis PERIOD

The car will not be used Nassau notes to transport patients PERIOD Patient transport will still be left to Rural Metro if such treatment is requested by MERT or UR Security PERIOD

Although the vehicle will not transport patients it adds a new dimension to campus saftey PERIOD

They will be operating on a new level Mauldin said.Wrobel is a member of the class of  PERIOD
