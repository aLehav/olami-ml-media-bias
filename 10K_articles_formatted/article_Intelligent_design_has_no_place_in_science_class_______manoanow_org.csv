UWIRE MADISON Wis PERIOD  Intelligent design resurfaced in
Wisconsin politics last week when Rep PERIOD Terese Berceau DMadison
proposed a bill to ban its teaching in public schools in
Wisconsin PERIOD

The past year of the fight between intelligent design and
evolution was significant because it witnessed the first
highprofile court case regarding intelligent design PERIOD In December
a U.S PERIOD District Court judge in Pennsylvania ruled in favor of 
parents who sued the Dover Area School District because of a
statement about intelligent design that was read aloud in
ninthgrade science classes PERIOD He found that the teaching of
intelligent design in schools violated the Establishment Clause of
the First Amendment which states that 

The first area where intelligent design fails is religion PERIOD
Supporters contend it is not a religious theory but when it is
rejected they cry religious persecution PERIOD In Justice John E PERIOD Jones
139page judicial opinion he said 

His statement is entirely accurate  it is creationism by
another name and in no way should be taught in our science classes PERIOD
It violates the separation between church and state PERIOD More
importantly though it is not scientific PERIOD

The supporters of the Wisconsin law cite similar concerns PERIOD At a
news conference with Rep PERIOD Spencer Black and University of Wisconsin
 Madison professors Berceau said 

Originally the case in Dover was over a small statement to be
read aloud in class which spoke about other theories besides
evolution PERIOD But the case argued in front of the district court
showed 

I have no problem with mentioning creationism PERIOD In fact my
tenthgrade biology teacher upon starting our evolution unit
mentioned creationism as an alternative to evolution PERIOD However he
made it abundantly clear that it had no scientific standing
whatsoever and would not be taught in his class PERIOD

For a theory to qualify as scientific it should be consistent
parsimonious useful empirically testable and falsifiable
correctable dynamic and progressive PERIOD Intelligent design meets none
of these standards PERIOD

Its argument consists mainly of claims that there are some
things that are too irreducibly complex for evolution to explain
alone meaning a system could not have possibly been formed by
successive slight modifications to a previous system PERIOD This is the
premise of evolution and intelligent design assumes it to be
false PERIOD They point to the human eye as an example but as Daily
Cardinal science columnist Adam Dylewski pointed out in November
scientists now have come up with a plausible sequence of explaining
the great complexity of our eyes PERIOD

Simply put intelligent design is not science and it violates
the separation of church and state PERIOD It does not belong in a science
class and Berceaus plan should be supported PERIOD
