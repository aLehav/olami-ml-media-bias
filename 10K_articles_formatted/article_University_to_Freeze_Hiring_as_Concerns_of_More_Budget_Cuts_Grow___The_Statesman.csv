Stony Brook University is once again feeling the effects of the New York State budget cuts according to a press release issued from President Shirley Strum Kenny PERIOD As a result the university will put a freeze on hiring of all staff and faculty PERIOD

The freeze is in response to the New York State budget deficit PERIOD On Oct PERIOD  Governor Paterson called for a special session of the New York Legislature and is asking them to cut another  billion from the state budget to compensate for the . billion New York State deficit PERIOD

According to Dan Melucci Associate Vice President for Strategy Planning and Analysis SUNY could get a cut in the    million range and Stony Brook could get as much as  million of that amount

Just over a month ago Stony Brook took a . million budget cut PERIOD With the dire economic situation however the university will be called to cut more PERIOD We dont know what Stony Brooks share will be said Melucci PERIOD

Melucci also said that the reasoning behind the freeze on hiring is so the university would not have to lay off as much staff in the future and so the overall payroll doesnt decline PERIOD

The university will be putting a freeze on all positions supported by state funds PERIOD These positions however are charged to direct research grants income fund reimbursable accounts and the residence hall fund PERIOD The university hospital and Veterans Home will not be frozen PERIOD

The journalism department is one area of the school that could suffer the most from this cut being one of the newer additions to the university PERIOD

It is too early to know the real impact of the freeze said Howard Schneider the dean of the school of journalism PERIOD We hope that we can continue to grow rapidly and that the freeze will be lifted. there are so many unknowns right now Mr PERIOD Melucci said PERIOD Overall what we can expect from this cut is fewer faculties and what students have feared an eventual tuition rise PERIOD

Positions that will not be frozen are the replacing of Kenny after her retirement at the end of the year and any dean positions PERIOD
