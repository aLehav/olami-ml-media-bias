Freshman catcheroutfielder Luca Tresh takes a swing against Clemson on Saturday May   at Doak Field PERIOD Tresh went  with two strikeouts and one walk in the Wolfpacks  loss PERIOD

With the  Minor League Baseball season already upon us several MiLB Pack Pros are continuing their push to climb through the ranks and become MLB Pack Pros PERIOD Among them six former Wolfpack players are ranked among the top  prospects in their respective organizations PERIOD Lets take a look at what lies ahead for these aspiring major leaguers PERIOD

Patrick Bailey catcher San Francisco Giants

With Joey Bart generating a lot of hubbub with the spring hes had it can be easy to forget that the Giants have not just one but two catchers among the top  prospects in their organization with Patrick Bailey in the mix PERIOD While Bart looks like the immediate successor to longtime San Fran backstop Buster Posey Bailey still carries a lot of upside with him heading into the  season PERIOD

In his first pro season Bailey excelled with the SingleA San Jose Giants but struggled in the jump to the Eugene Emeralds in HighA ball PERIOD The switchhitter saw his onbase percentage drop by . between San Jose and Eugene while nearly matching his strikeout total in  fewer plate appearances PERIOD For a prospect whose offensive calling card is his plate discipline Bailey will have to make significant progress at the plate to stay on track for his journey to the show PERIOD

Still theres no reason to be concerned about Baileys development PERIOD The Giants have a reputation of developing good catchers in their organization see Bart and Bailey has the defensive tools and leadership to succeed behind the plate PERIOD As the No PERIOD  prospect in the San Francisco system a rough patch in his rookie campaign wont derail that all at once PERIOD

Tyler McDonough outfieldersecond baseman Boston Red Sox

NC State baseball fans will remember Tyler McDonough as the center fielder for the  team that made it to the College World Series but McDonoughs defensive alignment looks like it will be more fluid at the professional level PERIOD Much like former Red Sox fan favorite Brock Holt McDonough is emerging as a utility defender at second base as well as center field PERIOD

On the offensive side McDonough is also switching to a more powerbased approach at the plate PERIOD Although the switchhitter tied for the most home runs on that  Wolfpack squad McDonoughs power numbers primarily came from his ability to drive the ball into the gap and leg out extra base hits as exemplified by his teamleading  doubles for NC State in his final season PERIOD At the pro level McDonough has put on some muscle to increase his raw power at the dish taking away a smidgen of his speed PERIOD

With only half a season of minor league baseball under his belt McDonough wont be playing at Fenway Park until around  but his promisingly smooth transmission into the professional ranks makes him a big piece of Bostons farm system good enough for No PERIOD  in the organization PERIOD

Nick Swiney lefthanded pitcher San Francisco Giants

For a guy that missed over two months of his first pro season with a concussion Nick Swiney had a really good  PERIOD

As in . eRA in  starts good PERIOD

Granted Swiney had a light workload while rehabbing his injury PERIOD He never reached five full innings in a single start in rookie ball or in SingleA with the San Jose Giants but allowing just three earned runs in . innings is nothing to scoff at PERIOD On top of  home runs allowed in  Swineys numbers give the Giants a lot to be excited about PERIOD

The southpaws success both past and future hinges on his two best pitches a wicked upper70s curveball and a changeup with a little more oomph PERIOD While both carry immense swing and miss potential Swiney will need to learn to throw them consistently for strikes as his opponents plate discipline improves with each level of the minor leagues PERIOD His low 90s fastball will help him pound the strike zone as well PERIOD

Although Swineys concussion resulted from a freak occurrence of him hitting his head on a bus door the 6foot3 lefty will also need to prove his durability in the coming year if he wants to remain a starter in the pros PERIOD If he cant withstand the grind of a full seasons worth of innings Swiney may be moved to a relief role PERIOD For now he sits at a respectable rank of No PERIOD  in the Giants organization PERIOD

Jose Torres shortstop Cincinnati Reds

The Cincinnati Reds seem to have started a rebuild this offseason with the departure of several key pieces from the major league roster PERIOD Lefthanded pitcher Amir Garrett got dealt to the Royals left fielder Jesse Winker and third baseman Eugenio Suarez were shipped to Seattle and right fielder Nick Castellanos left for Philadelphia in free agency PERIOD

And that will make it a  offseason PERIOD

That being said Jose Torres is now in a great position to develop his game just in time for a possible Reds resurgence in  PERIOD Along with Cincinnatis top prospects that are set to break into the show over the next couple of years Torres could make the jump to the majors as part of a new wave of young Reds talent PERIOD

Torres in particular is primarily a defensive shortstop but his bat caught fire in his first professional season PERIOD The rookie slashed ... over  plate appearances with the SingleA Daytona Tortugas in  a pace that will accelerate his progression through the minor leagues if he is able to maintain it PERIOD With his already solid glove the Reds No PERIOD  prospect has all the necessary tools to make it to the big leagues PERIOD Now he just needs to produce PERIOD

Luca Tresh catcher Kansas City Royals

Although he is the furthest from the show out of anyone in this group projected to make his MLB debut in  Luca Tresh has the simplest road to get there PERIOD To put it bluntly Tresh wont reach his full potential until he learns to limit his strikeouts PERIOD

Much like his  season with the Wolfpack Treshs raw power was hampered in his first pro season by his inability to get the bat on the ball PERIOD In SingleA Columbia Tresh struck out in  of his  atbats and registered just one extrabase hit for an abysmal slashline of ... for the season PERIOD Until Tresh can better work the count and show more plate discipline his tremendous upside will continue to go to waste PERIOD

Make no mistake Tresh is a great baseball player PERIOD Not every 17thround pick gets a  signing bonus and his teammates in the minors have praised him for his leadership and competitiveness PERIOD But after a  campaign that left a lot to be desired  will be a big year for the Royals No PERIOD  prospect to prove that he has what it takes to succeed PERIOD

Will Wilson shortstop San Francisco Giants

With lefthanded pitcher and MLB Pack Pro Carlos Rodn inking a deal with the Giants this past offseason San Francisco further solidified its connection with NC State baseball as Will Wilson completes the minor league trio of himself Bailey and Swiney PERIOD

That being said  will be Wilsons third season as a pro and the pressure to live up to his No PERIOD  overall selection in the  draft is mounting PERIOD His lack of mobility in the field hints at a future move away from shortstop so Wilson will need his bat to rebound in  if he wants to stay relevant in the Giants organization PERIOD

The jump to DoubleA is regarded as the most difficult in the minor leagues and Wilsons experience was no exception PERIOD After  productive games with HighA Eugene to start the  season Wilson slashed a miserable ... with DoubleA Richmond over  games PERIOD

These numbers were exacerbated by Wilsons  strikeouts in  plate appearances showing he has a lot of work to do if he wants to stay on track for his projected MLB debut in  PERIOD For the Giants No PERIOD  prospect  will need to be the year that Wilson takes his game to the next level PERIOD
