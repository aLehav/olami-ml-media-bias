Professor of psychology Daniel Lapsley said the majority of teenagers violate the law in some way he stole a Bob Dylan album when he was younger but this behavior is not indicative of a teen at risk of a life of crime PERIOD

Lapsley who also serves as the chair of the PsychologyDepartment spoke in the Eck Visitors Center auditorium Thursday evening about adolescent development and its effect on behavior and the formation of identity PERIOD Lapsleys talk was titled The Promise and Perils of Adolescence and was sponsored by the Notre Dame Club of St PERIOD Joseph Valley PERIOD

Lapsley said changes in the way the brain processes serotonin and dopamine during adolescence can affect the way anadolescent weighs decisions and their consequences PERIOD

The teen is more drawn to the potential benefits of a decision than the potential consequences and this is because of the work of the limbic system hesaid PERIOD Teens are drawn to immediate benefit so much so that they are willing to settle for less as long as the benefit is received faster. as kids get older they are more likely to consider both the risk and the benefit of their decisions and they are more likely to consider the long term consequences of their actions he said PERIOD

Lapsley said there are elements of adolescence that are shared across different species  something that is a result of evolutionary changes in the brain PERIOD

This occurs not just in human adolescence but across all mammalian species Lapsley said PERIOD This indicates that this risktaking and sensationseeking conveys an evolutionary advantage which is a point I hope you keep in mind in worrying about of your own kids. as result teenagers are more emotional more responsive to stress and more likely to engage in reward and sensationseeking he said PERIOD These changes also make teenagers more vulnerable to substance abuse and depression. lapsley said a concern to answer the question Who am I drives the intellectual complexity of the adolescent PERIOD The search for the answer to this question he said can result in a sense of egocentrism in which teens feel as though they are the center of the attention PERIOD

As a consequence of adolescent egocentrism teens are set to construct imaginary audiences Lapsley said PERIOD They assume that they are on stage and everyone else in their lives is the audience they are playing to and so this is said to account for the heightened sense of selfconsciousness PERIOD Youd be selfconscious too if you thought the whole school was buzzing about you noticing all of your flaws and applauding your achievements. the professorsaid adolescence is characterized by a search for identity one that is consistent between the person you were as a child and the promise of what you will be in adulthood PERIOD

I think individuation is a balancing between agency and community Lapsley said PERIOD This is sometimes called the basic duality of human existence PERIOD We all want to be independent and autonomous but we dont want to be isolated or alienated or lonely PERIOD

As much we yearn for attachment union and love we dont want to be enmeshed in our relationships PERIOD We must strike a balance and a lot of the pain of adolescence is trying to find out where that balance is. hesaid improving the ability of a child to cope with adversity doesnt take anything exotic it just takes the formation of meaningful healthy relationships PERIOD

The most important part of resiliency is that a kid has one good relationship with a caring adult who conveys that to the child Lapsley said PERIOD Children bring a lot to the table but the most important thing is that this recruit the attention of an adult in a childs life. lapsley said he hopes his audience identifies with his topics in the same way he identifies with them PERIOD

I think thats why I got into this he said PERIOD I think thats why I study adolescence because at the end of the day the topics that are of interest to me that I like to study and write about are things that I think Ive wrestled with myself. share This Story
