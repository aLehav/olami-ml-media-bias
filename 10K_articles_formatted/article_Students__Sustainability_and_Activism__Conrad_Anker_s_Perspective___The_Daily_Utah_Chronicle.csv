465,2023-10-23,"before he was a worldrenowned mountain climber Conrad Anker was an undergraduate at the University of Utah PERIOD A California native Anker was attracted to Utah by the variety of outdoor activities that the Beehive State has to offer PERIOD

If youre a climber or skier the U is great he said PERIOD

Once at the U Anker found his place in the Parks Recreation and Tourism program PERIOD Before he graduated in  Anker had started his own clothing company and climbed Gurney Peak of the Kichatna Mountains in Alaska PERIOD He also actively protested apartheid in South Africa PERIOD

Along with other students at the U Anker was part of a worldwide student movement against the minority rule by white South Africans in the traditionally and predominantly black country PERIOD Protesting U students demanded that the U divest from its South Africarelated investments PERIOD

South Africa was still under apartheid Anker said so that was an issue that was relevant to students while I was there. attempting to publicize the issue in a way U administrators couldnt ignore Anker and others assembled a shantytown on campus as a visual representation of the unjust situation in South Africa PERIOD

In a statement at a hearing for the United States Student Movement Against Apartheid at the United Nations Headquarters in  a student representative from the U recalled that the shanty forced a public reopening of the divesture issue and sparked interest and discussion from the university and community. the movement was met with outrage and opposition from the night the first shanty was built PERIOD Camps were repeatedly vandalized and at one point a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the protesters PERIOD

On a particularly destructive night one activists apartment was broken into and upturned PERIOD His walls carpeting clothing furniture and a large collect of rare first edition books were covered with the word Pinko in spray paint shampoo and toilet bowl cleanser the U.N PERIOD statement reads PERIOD

In the end the shanty strategy was successful and U administrators agreed to divest from any investments benefitting the South African government PERIOD

We camped out on it Anker remembers PERIOD We got the campus to divest. anker said student movements today remind him of his activism in the 80s  like the fossil fuel divestment campaign PERIOD

Recently U students and faculty began pressuring the U to stop investing in fossil fuel PERIOD In May  the Academic Senate narrowly voted in favor of divestment PERIOD The Board of Trustees however later reversed the decision PERIOD

Anker is in favor of divestment and said climate change is too important an issue to ignore or marginalize PERIOD

Climate change is real he said PERIOD We should stop debating whether it is real science or not PERIOD Its real PERIOD Its happening PERIOD Look at the air quality in Salt Lake  its unbearable. in Ankers view students play an important role in encouraging change in society PERIOD They also have an obligation to look out for future generations he said PERIOD

Never has the opportunity been better for students who are graduating Anker said PERIOD But at the same time the responsibilities are more immense than what they might have been. he believes this obligation applies particularly to those in the U.S PERIOD Realize that living in the United States we are extremely privileged and that there should be a sense of responsibility for us to be agents of positive change. ankers brand of activism is an optimistic one PERIOD His life motto is Be kind PERIOD Be good PERIOD Be happy. he highlighted the benefits of seeing things from both sides of the issue and approaching matters with a bipartisan outlook PERIOD

Were not going to bring about change by being bombastic and angry and divided he said PERIOD Were going to bring about change by all of us coming together and listening to the other side. in February Patagonia Peak Design and other outdoor recreation companies announced they would boycott Utahs Outdoor Retailer show in retaliation to the states environmental policies PERIOD Soon after following a sitdown with Gov PERIOD Gary Herbert the organizers of the convention announced they would move the event altogether PERIOD

Anker disagrees with the decision to pull the show from Utah PERIOD Along with companies like REI and The North Face Anker believes the decision will hurt small companies and Utahs tourism market PERIOD

Tourism drives the economy and its in a sustainable way Anker said PERIOD I think we can get more change done by being collaborative keeping the show and having a discussion with the elected officials of Utah PERIOD If we pull out for many of the conservative people theyre like Hey we won we dont care. anker admitted that he is sad to see Outdoor Retailer leave Utah which he said is a great place to have the trade show. i like it because Ive got Utah roots  its always been a part of where Im at and to see the trade show leave there I feel we arent moving the cause of being more environmentally aware Anker said PERIOD

Political views aside Anker who will speak at the Us commencement in May said students should be involved with what is happening in their communities PERIOD Care about your life and your environment he said PERIOD

As a climber academic and activist Anker has both literally and figuratively lived life on the edge PERIOD After suffering a heart attack in November  he has learned to appreciate the mundane aspects of life PERIOD I was like damn PERIOD I couldve died PERIOD I probably should have died Anker said but I survived PERIOD And because of that I approach life as every day being a gift. emailprotected
