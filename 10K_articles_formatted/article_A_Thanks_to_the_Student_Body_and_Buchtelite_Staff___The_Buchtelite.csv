By  Brooklyn Dennison EditorinChiefMay  

The Buchtelite has grown substantially over the course of the school year and it could not have been done without the help of the student body PERIOD

As the independent student newspaper The Buchtelite takes pride in both writing news that students may not have known about and relaying their concerns and opinions to the entire campus community PERIOD

Last spring semester the paper had gone on hiatus PERIOD It was brought back with a new staff and a new business model PERIOD Growing our readership and involvement with the student community was one of the goals we had in designing our new model PERIOD The more involvement The Buchtelite has with students the more we can better understand and thus better write about topics and concerns they are interested in PERIOD

We communicate with students in several ways PERIOD If we do not talk to students directly or via email The Buchtelite releases surveys to gather information PERIOD We also accept opinion pieces from students which may be published in the paper PERIOD I want to thank all of those who have communicated with us or have completed surveys we have sent out PERIOD We would not be able to successfully be the independent student newspaper without you PERIOD

I also want to thank the hardworking students and faculty members who have worked tirelessly to keep the paper going as a business PERIOD Professors Julie Cajigas and Val Pipps worked to keep The Buchtelite from going away completely after it had been on hiatus PERIOD Without them there may not currently be a student newspaper PERIOD I have so much respect for them both as people and as educators PERIOD

The Buchtelite staff is also utterly respected in my eyes PERIOD They have worked so hard to learn newswriting style and upkeep newswriting standards in a short amount of time PERIOD Two of our editors are graduating this semester sports and entertainment editor Erika Newcome and copy editor Robert Barrett Jr PERIOD I wish them the best luck in their endeavors and it was such a pleasure being able to work with them PERIOD

If any student is interested in newswriting we are always accepting volunteer writers and we also have a few open paid positions available PERIOD We are interested in finding a sports editor an arts and entertainment editor a social media editor and a special editions editor PERIOD If a student is interested in any of these positions they can contact me at emailprotected PERIOD

Likewise a student can email me if they have a topic they would like covered in The Buchtelite or if they would like to submit an opinion piece PERIOD Please submit your opinion pieces at emailprotected PERIOD We value your opinions and your viewpoints and would like to hear what you have to say PERIOD

In the future we plan on sending out surveys via our eedition PERIOD Our eedition is a weekly email that consists of the stories we have written over the past week PERIOD If you would like to have our stories delivered to your email or would like to participate in our student surveys several times a semester you can subscribe at httpsbuchtelite.comsubscribe PERIOD

Thank you for reading the Buchtelite PERIOD I look forward to writing news for you and on your behalf next school year PERIOD
