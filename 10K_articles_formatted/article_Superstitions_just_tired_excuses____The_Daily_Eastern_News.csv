If youre superstitious raise your left hand spin around counterclockwise three times touch your nose with your right index finger and howl at the moon on Friday the thirteenth while trying to ignore the smell of your lucky socks you havent washed in seven months PERIOD



Now that youve made a complete fool of yourself give up all that crap PERIOD

Superstitions have a weird way of controlling the way people think PERIOD These irrational beliefs take away reason and logic and turn intelligent people into a heartless mob looking for a scapegoat PERIOD

Did that sound like the way Cubs fans acted toward Steve Bartman Because I was actually trying to describe the Salem witch trials PERIOD

Superstitions have a funny way of making people believe they are doomed to fail its called a curse PERIOD

The curse is the most feared superstition PERIOD It is fueled by coincidences and traces its beginnings to the archives of history PERIOD

In the Cubs case a fan tries to bring a billy goat to a game the team says you cant bring a goat into Wrigley Field and the next thing you know the Cubs are cursed forever PERIOD

It was just a silly Greek superstition at the time but now its a fullblown curse PERIOD Unfortunate events like Mr PERIOD Bartmans interference with the ball only add to the strength of the curse PERIOD Cubs opponents like the St PERIOD Louis Post Dispatch like to add to belief in the curse by printing the word CURSED in huge letters on the front page PERIOD

Speaking of curses on the front page of a publication how about the Sports Illustrated cover curse

The October   issue of Sports Illustrated features Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood and Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez PERIOD Is it a curse that caused the two stud pitchers to lose the decisive games of their respective league championship series or just coincidence The highly superstitious will argue the date of the publication might strengthen the argument for the existence of a curse PERIOD

The Red Sox havent done a very good job of avoiding the label of being cursed PERIOD After winning the World Series in  Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruths contract to the Yankees and used the money to produce the play No No Nanette. any rational human being can see these things for what they are  coincidences PERIOD

Curses dont exist except in the mind of the naive PERIOD Curses get their power from the same source of the gods in Greek mythology the irrational fear of people PERIOD

A curse is the same thing as luck PERIOD

I remember watching a report on  or Dateline or some other news show examine luck PERIOD

They examined two women  one believing she had good luck and the other believing she had bad luck PERIOD

The two each chose from the same of pair unsolvable puzzles and each was told one was solvable and the other wasnt PERIOD The woman with bad luck assumed she had chosen the unsolvable puzzle and gave up in under a minute PERIOD The woman with good luck thought she had the solvable one and tried for several minutes until she was told neither puzzle was solvable PERIOD

A curse is believing something bad will happen to prevent you from accomplishing your goal PERIOD Persistence and optimism is the key to success PERIOD

I used to believe I should stop watching Cubs games if they were doing badly while I was watching PERIOD After I realized I wasnt watching too many Cubs games I decided to give that superstition up PERIOD

There is no point in being a fan if youre not going to watch the game PERIOD

Forget the curses forget the superstitions and just enjoy the game folks PERIOD
