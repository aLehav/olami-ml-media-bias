With  Now NYU is spotlighting its many initiatives targeted at improving the universitys sustainability PERIOD Heres what students think PERIOD

Natalia KempthorneCuriel Staff Photographer  April  

In  NYU released its very first Climate Action Plan PERIOD It set the longterm climate goals for the university which included a plan to achieve a  reduction in carbon emissions by  and complete carbon neutrality by  PERIOD However many students are not convinced that NYU is doing enough to reach this goal PERIOD

There are several student clubs on campus that have spoken out against the universitys sustainability initiatives such as Sunrise NYU Earth Matters NYU and the Alliance for Environmental and Social Justice PERIOD To truly reduce its impact on the environment these organizations say the university must work toward divesting from fossil fuels PERIOD



NYU has promoted  Now the name of the carbon neutral initiative with events like the ReFashion Show a runway featuring sustainable fashion and the One World Suite Performance an evening of music moving images and spoken word that celebrate the beauty of Earth PERIOD The  Now plan aims for students to live like its  and prompts the university community to motivate each other to boost climate efforts PERIOD

NYUs main focus has been reducing energy loss lowering greenhouse gas emissions and improving waste management with help from the Office of Sustainability PERIOD



The Better Buildings initiative

Buildings account for  of greenhouse gas emissions in New York City PERIOD As one of the citys largest landowners NYU has worked to increase energy efficiency in its buildings and thereby reduce energy consumption PERIOD

According to Cecil Scheib NYUs chief sustainability officer the university plans to renovate Rubin Hall during the  school year to improve energy efficiency and protect the building from outside temperatures  addressing the lack of heat during winter as well as the notoriously hot early fall and late spring living conditions with triplepane windows PERIOD Additionally the school plans to implement new ventilation systems and move toward complete electrification which requires replacing the existing heating and cooling systems that run on fossil fuels with a  million grant from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority PERIOD



Green spaces



NYUs Native Woodland Garden outside of Bobst Library is one of the universitys many sustainable landscaping projects including the  Thompson Rooftop Garden which reintroduces indigenous plants into the citys ecosystem PERIOD These projects also provide environmental benefits such as increasing shaded area to reduce heat and expanding habitats for local species PERIOD



Additionally NYUs 3700squarefoot green roof atop the Global Center for Academic and Spiritual Life is a lowmaintenance garden that absorbs water to reduce runoff during storms PERIOD



Switching to renewable energy is vital if the university wants to achieve a sustainable future PERIOD Just last year NYU installed  solar panels on the roof of Bobst PERIOD These solar panels produce approximately  kilowatts of energy during their peak hours PERIOD

While we shouldnt disregard the initiatives NYU has made toward achieving environmental sustainability students like Dylan Wahbe Sunrise NYUs Hub Coordinator and a member of the Student Government Assemblys sustainability committee believe that the university should do more to show their commitment to sustainability and climate change efforts PERIOD



NYUs Fossil Fuels Investments



NYU has over  million invested in fossil fuel companies PERIOD This must end Wahbe said PERIOD NYU has a moral obligation to denounce the fossil fuel industry and make our endowment fossil free PERIOD We know this wont happen overnight however NYU must make the commitment today. sunrise NYU is a studentled prodivestment group campaigning for NYU to retract current investments in fossil fuel companies PERIOD The organization has partnered with other groups on campus such as Earth Matters NYU the universitys longestrunning environmental club focused on creating a community that values the planet and the College of Art and Science Student Council PERIOD



The university cannot promote sustainability in good conscience until it completely cuts ties with the fossil fuel industry PERIOD

The climate crisis is here PERIOD If NYU wants to be seen as a green school it cannot maintain its investments in an industry dedicated to destroying human life Wahbe said PERIOD



To invest in our future NYU must divest from fossil fuels PERIOD
