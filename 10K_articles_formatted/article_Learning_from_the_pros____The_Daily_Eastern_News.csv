It was not an ordinary day at the office over at OBrien Stadium PERIOD



I walked into work today and except for maybe gamedays I never felt the same buzz around the office defensive coordinator Roc Bellantoni said PERIOD

If the Indianapolis Colts were to set up shop in Charleston for their training camp it would benefit Easterns football program in several ways including learning directly from the professionals PERIOD

Hopefully the college coaches can come in to our meetings and learn from us Indianapolis head coach Tony Dungy said PERIOD

The feeling is Dungy can teach the Panther coaching staff much about the specifics of the game especially on the defensive side of the ball PERIOD

Eastern head football coach Bob Spoo ran across the former Tampa Bay coach when Dungy was quarterbacking the Minnesota Golden Gophers from  PERIOD At that time Spoo was the University of Wisconsins quarterbacks coach PERIOD

Coach Dungy and I go way back when I was at Wisconsin and Purdue he was at Minnesota and we went up against each other at least once a year Spoo said PERIOD Hes everything that they say he is PERIOD Hes a pleasant man and an all around great person. dungy began his coaching career at his alma mater in  PERIOD The SpooDungy relationship continued PERIOD

Dungy broke into the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers in the mid 1980s as a defensive coordinator PERIOD He then latched onto the Minnesota Vikings with the same position from  PERIOD

After his stint with the Vikings Dungy landed the Tampa Bay head coaching job in  and was let go in  after four playoff appearances in his six years at the helm PERIOD

In  Dungy went to the Colts and led them to the playoffs PERIOD Dungy followed his  playoff appearance with a repeat trip to the postseason in  PERIOD

Since the  NFLAFL merger only  teams have scored as many as seven defensive touchdowns in a season PERIOD Four of those have come under Dungys guidance PERIOD

Bellantoni said he has always admired Dungys defensive philosophy and the way he is able to scheme gameplans PERIOD

Im excited to have him here Bellantoni said PERIOD Id like to be able to have the chance to copy what he has done PERIOD Im interested in figuring out why they do things and how they fix things when they have problems. according to the coaching staff the perception NFL scouts have of Eastern is the program could change for the positive PERIOD

I think the players would get something out of watching the pros perform Spoo said PERIOD They already idolize them but seeing them live is something different. spoo said the presence of an NFL team on a college campus where a top high school recruit is thinking about attending can be a huge advantage when it comes time for that recruit to decide what college he will play for PERIOD

He said a few years back the St PERIOD Louis Rams were holding their training camp at Western Illinois University PERIOD There was an offensive lineman both Eastern and Western were recruiting PERIOD The lineman eventually chose the Leathernecks and cited the presence of an NFL team as one of the biggest reasons for heading to Macomb PERIOD

Spoo and the entire Eastern staff hope the Panthers can acquire that advantage PERIOD
