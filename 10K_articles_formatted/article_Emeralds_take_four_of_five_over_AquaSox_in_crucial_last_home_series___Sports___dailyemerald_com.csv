Ismael Munguia  points towards the dugout after hitting a single early in the game PERIOD The Eugene Emeralds suffered a major  defeat at the hands of the Everett AquaSox on Wednesday July  at PK Park in Eugene Oregon PERIOD Will GeschkeEmerald

The Eugene Emeralds really needed this PERIOD

After a shaky and frustrating road trip they returned to PK Park for the last time with authority PERIOD They took the first four games against the Everett AquaSox only falling in the nightcap of Fridays doubleheader which ended their sixgame winning streak PERIOD

The strong performance was particularly important in the standings they remained a half game ahead of the Spokane Indians and pulled to . games ahead of the AquaSox PERIOD Just one week of baseball remains as the Emeralds look to win the HighA West PERIOD

Offense overcame shaky pitching

The Emeralds offense which went through a beyond brutal stretch on the road the previous two weeks showed up last week PERIOD They posted a ... line as a team hitting nine homers and scoring  runs in five games PERIOD Twenty of those runs came in the first two games PERIOD

Ismael Munguia was the offensive star going a blistering 10for18 with just one strikeout PERIOD He singlehandedly won the first game of Fridays doubleheader for Eugene tying the game with a home run and later hitting a walkoff single in the  victory PERIOD

Armani Smith Sean Roby Franklin Labour and Jairo Pomares also had super strong weeks in their own right PERIOD

The Emeralds pitching while not terrible wasnt as dominant PERIOD They gave up  runs posting a . team ERA PERIOD They struck out  batters while limiting Everett to  walks  a super solid . strikeouttowalk ratio PERIOD

The standout pitching performance came from Conner Nurse PERIOD He pitched seven innings of onerun ball striking out a careerhigh  PERIOD Over his last five starts he owns a . eRA with  strikeouts compared to  walks in   innings PERIOD Its been a tough year for Nurse at times but hes finishing the season remarkably strong PERIOD

Seth Corry has looked a lot better since returning from an extended developmental assignment although the Emeralds have been limiting his innings PERIOD He pitched three innings in one game this series surrendering just one hit and most importantly no walks PERIOD Prior to his developmental assignment he was issuing walks at a historically abysmal rate PERIOD

In the short time that hes been back he seems to be locating his curveball much better which is key for him since thats his main out pitch PERIOD

Another bright spot for the Emeralds on the pitching side has been the bullpen duo Austin Reich and Chris Wright PERIOD Theyve been lights out nearly every time with Reich usually handling the seventh andor eighth inning and Wright shutting the door in the ninth PERIOD

Reich has a . eRA with  strikeouts in   innings . k9 while Wright has a . eRA with  strikeouts in  innings . k9 PERIOD

Its now or never heading into the last week of the season

This season has been a grind  in fact its been by far the longest season in Emeralds history considering its their first year as a fullseason team PERIOD

But its all finally going to come to an end this week on the road PERIOD The Emeralds will technically be the home team even though theyll be playing in Pasco Washington PERIOD Theyre scheduled to play six games against the TriCity Dust Devils who havent actually played a game since Sept PERIOD  due to COVID19 contact tracing within their team PERIOD

As of now the upcoming series is expected to be played as scheduled PERIOD

The top two teams in the HighA West will compete in a bestoffive series after the regular season is complete PERIOD Due to PK Park not meeting fullseason minor league baseball standards the Emeralds will not be able to host any games should they make the playoffs PERIOD

With Eugene back in first place its a fairly safe bet to say that theyll at least be in it PERIOD The question is if theyll win the league or not PERIOD Theyre just a half game ahead of Spokane but . games ahead of third place Everett PERIOD

The AquaSox led the HighA West  even by a comfortable margin at times  for the majority of the season yet they likely wont even make the two team playoffs PERIOD

Barring any COVID19 related cancellations the Emeralds are set to kick off their series against TriCity on Tuesday at  p.m PERIOD
