was upset driving to the Nitro Burger food truck PERIOD

Why am I driving to them Trucks have wheels PERIOD Come to me Nitro Burger PERIOD You have both truck and nitro in your name PERIOD I just have a sedan PERIOD

I tracked the truck using Nitro Burgers Facebook page feeling like agent Cody Banks in the process PERIOD They were located on twenty-ninth and O but I originally thought I had the wrong place PERIOD The truck had been transformed to a stand with a grill in front and what looked like record sleeves plastered on the side of it PERIOD When I got closer I could tell they were cutout pictures of burgers which was a tad disappointing but also exciting PERIOD

I was greeted by a nice woman named Cherry who asked if it was my first time to Nitro Burger PERIOD I sheepishly told her it was not liking the feeling of giving her an advantage PERIOD She told me everything would taste good and looking at the record sleeve burger photos I could tell she was right PERIOD

I ordered a Stars and Stripes burger which was the closest thing to what I consider a normal burger lettuce tomatoes mayo cheese patriotic name alongside an order of steak fries and spent about  in the process PERIOD Her husband I think threw a large patty on the grill as I ordered PERIOD Cherry told me it would take about eight minutes and I quickly retreated to my car afraid of small talk PERIOD I remembered the Nitro Burger Facebook page telling me I could have texted my order ahead of time and I immediately regretted my decision to interact with other people PERIOD

I kept the drivers side door open listening to the knucklecracking sounds of the patty on the grill the smoky aroma breezing into my car PERIOD I checked my phone fervently waiting for the clock to head from  when Cherry told me about my wait to  when I hustled out of my car and into the warm embrace of my burger PERIOD I thanked Cherry and Eddy for the food waved goodbye to their young daughter Cheddy running around the truck and took off back to my apartment PERIOD

I laid out my food and marveled for a second PERIOD The steak fries were a ridiculous kind of big like halfapotatosized PERIOD It took six bites to eat a steak fry PERIOD It reminded me of the fries my mom used to make in the oven the ones I would smother with too much ketchup PERIOD

I smothered the steak fries with too much ketchup and joked about their size with my roommate PERIOD I moved onto the burger grabbing a fistfull of paper towels before getting started PERIOD

Nitro Burgers make what an old high school teacher used to call sink burgers because youre better off eating them over the sink PERIOD Ketchup and mustard stained my fingers before I even started eating but when I did I no longer cared what was on my hands PERIOD

The burger was very good PERIOD The mayo gave a good kick juxtaposed against the sweet taste of ketchup PERIOD The large patty was a slightly charred but it gave it a nice taste like enjoying a burger at a buddys backyard BBQ PERIOD I snarfed down the burger and sat there content with what I was digesting PERIOD

Nitro Burger updates their Facebook page regularly to say where and when theyll be available PERIOD Lincolnites looking for a different food experience should keep their eyes open PERIOD
