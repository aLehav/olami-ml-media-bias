Head coaches James Franklin and Urban Meyer shake hands prior to the game between Penn State and Ohio State at Ohio Stadium on Saturday Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

Although many teams dont like to say any game is bigger than another neither Ohio State coach Urban Meyer nor Penn State coach James Franklin can deny that a white out at Penn State is something else PERIOD

From the Buckeyes perspective theyre playing in what Meyer described as one of the top five atmospheres in college football a place where players have said the ground literally shakes PERIOD

For the Nittany Lions theyre playing the No PERIOD 2ranked team in the country and Franklin said its going to be a big challenge PERIOD

Two years ago the matchup went to overtime with the Buckeyes coming out on top  PERIOD

Last year the score wasnt as close with the Buckeyes winning  but the Lions were still able to make an impression PERIOD One Lions player in particular ran all over the Buckeyes PERIOD

Running back Saquon Barkley a freshman at the time rushed for  yards at Ohio State PERIOD

His performance has improved throughout the season and Meyer recognizes him as an important factor his defense will have to control PERIOD

Youve got to tackle well and make sure youre gapsound Meyer said PERIOD Thats number one on the hit parade as far as defending Penn State PERIOD You wont stop him but youll minimize the impact the running back has on us. the main focus for the Lions defense will be Buckeyes quarterback J.T PERIOD Barrett who has a few years of experience under his belt and is also a running threat PERIOD

Franklin also mentioned the strong offensive line and speed of the running backs as a threat to the Lions while Meyer added the Lions receiving corps as other things the Buckeyes will have to prepare for PERIOD

We believe this is as good a group of receivers weve faced not just this year but in a while Meyer said PERIOD

Defensively Meyer said the Lions look similar to how they have in previous years in terms of style despite the change in coaching PERIOD

The Buckeyes defense however has a factor thats surprised Franklin this year PERIOD

On the defensive side of the ball Im amazed that Im saying this name again but Nick Bosa as a true freshman is playing and playing really well as well is their defensive line in general Franklin said PERIOD

Franklin said the team is talented and has depth at every position and he has marked three key components for success in the game PERIOD

The Lions have already shown improvement in the first area PERIOD

Last year against the Buckeyes the Lions had points called back because of penalties but this season Franklin said they are one of the more disciplined teams when it comes to penalties PERIOD

This will have to remain consistent on Saturday and minimize turnovers as well PERIOD

Controlling matchups is going to be vital too PERIOD

You see it every week when youre watching games on Saturday a team that you think is going to dominate and they go out and just dont play as well and you wonder why Franklin said PERIOD A lot of it deals with matchups. wide receiver DaeSean Hamilton expects physicality and aggressiveness from the Buckeyes defense but he is confident in the Lions ability to compete PERIOD

I think we compare to them  we match up to them with their skill players and our skill players we match up very well Hamilton said PERIOD

The Buckeyes are also going into this with confidence though PERIOD

Barrett believes that a team has to have confidence in order to have success PERIOD

If you dont think confident like that then youre not going to win many games PERIOD Its almost like youre counting yourself out PERIOD Man they got us there Barrett said PERIOD So I always have faith in our adjustments and what were trying to do on offense. the final component is going to be explosive plays  to minimize the Buckeyes ability to make big offensive plays and pair that with major plays from the Lions end PERIOD

They are a bigplay team Franklin said PERIOD We have to limit their explosiveness and we have to create big plays which is something that weve done a pretty good job of all year long. in addition to adding a level of control to the game explosive plays also get the crowd involved and this week it wont be just any crowd PERIOD

Were going to need our fans PERIOD Were going to need our alumni PERIOD Were going to need everybody Franklin said PERIOD This is a tremendous challenge that were facing all together and were going to need the stadium to be the most difficult environment in the history of college football come Saturday night. meyer on the other hand would rather the crowd not be as loud PERIOD

I wish theyd save the white out for other games he said PERIOD
