Saquon Barkley was Penn States offense in a nutshell last night both figuratively and literally PERIOD

The freshman back made his return to the starting lineup after missing two games with an ankle injury and he picked up right where he left off PERIOD Barkley carried  times for  yards but like the Nittany Lions offense for most of the night couldnt find the end zone PERIOD He accounted for more than half of Penn States  total yards in the contest PERIOD

Coach James Franklin said he was hopeful that Barkley would be back last weekend against Indiana but that obviously the youngster played well in his return PERIOD The coach said the key is to continue to build on that PERIOD

His best chance for a score came on a 44yard scamper where Barkley flew around the right end of the defense and outran Buckeye defenders down the sideline PERIOD

The back wouldve given Penn State seven had there not been a yellow flag on the field nabbing Brian Gaia for holding PERIOD

 wide receiver Chris Godwin said PERIOD 

Like he did in the Lions home opener against Buffalo the freshman hurdled another defender PERIOD This time Barkley ran to his right and in a oneonone situation he lifted himself over Buckeyes safety Tyvis Powell PERIOD Dante Booker then brought him down immediately after limiting the back to a gain of just five yards PERIOD

Barkleys longest carry of the night came on a 56yard run where he split two wouldbe tacklers at the line of scrimmage went up the middle into a fray of defenders and then cut back outside PERIOD He crossed the 50yard line and flew down the Penn State sideline before he was caught from behind and hauled out of bounds by Vonn Bell PERIOD

 offensive lineman Brendan Mahon said PERIOD 

Franklin said one of the things besides penalties that limited his running game was the inability of his offense to avoid negativeyardage plays PERIOD
