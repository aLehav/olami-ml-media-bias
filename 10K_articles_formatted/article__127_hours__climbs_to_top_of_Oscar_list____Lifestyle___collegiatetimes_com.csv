While its a far cry from his starcrossed lovers film Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle still delivers a heartpounding experience with  Hours a film that reeks of Oscar PERIOD

The movie chronicles the harrowing journey of Aron Ralston a thrillseeking adrenaline junkie who soon finds himself between a rock and a hard place  pun intended PERIOD After a terrifying fall while exploring canyons in Utah he becomes trapped when a fallen boulder pins his right arm to the canyon wall PERIOD

James Franco portrays the reallife adventurer with stunning ease as if he were born to play this role PERIOD From the first second of the film Franco brings a certain likability to the character PERIOD He is a suave yet outdoorsy smooth talker with some wayward female hikers PERIOD This quick characterization is crucial so the audience actually cares about him when he makes his untimely fall PERIOD

The truly amazing thing about this film is a semiinformed moviegoer knows how it will end yet still goes and is enthralled in it the entire time PERIOD Spoiler alert He cuts off his own arm to free himself and get away PERIOD That really isnt a spoiler though as the film is based off a real story PERIOD

That scene in particular was gory gruesome horrifying and beautiful PERIOD The film really lets the viewers imagine themselves in that situation and asks what they would do if push came to shove PERIOD Could you do it

Still the movie is given such great constraints PERIOD How could Boyle possibly concoct an interesting movie from what should be no more than a segment on  Minutes

For the bulk of the film as expected the giant boulder immobilizes Franco PERIOD However somehow Boyle manages to pull it off keeping the audience captivated throughout PERIOD

He uses an interesting splitscreen technique at times to show viewers several different vantage points simultaneously PERIOD Francos character also has a video camera he uses to document his horrible adventure which serves as a running monologue to the audience PERIOD This emotional element Franco conveys is what really keeps the viewer enthralled PERIOD

Boyle also cleverly uses flashbacks and hallucinations which sometimes intertwine to help pass the time PERIOD He does this to reflect the thoughts going through Francos mind PERIOD The film really does a great job of getting the viewer inside the characters head PERIOD You watch his thought process as he methodically works through all of the different scenarios in which he could escape PERIOD

So is this oneman movie the new trend Earlier this year Ryan Reynolds climbed into a coffin for the duration of Buried. this style of film is incredibly simple in terms of action and plot and instead explores the intricacies of human thought and wit PERIOD Its much different than the typical Hollywood shoot em up action flick and for that Im glad PERIOD  Hours is truly a breath of fresh air PERIOD

Another recent Hollywood trend the movie rails against  time PERIOD It seems like most films these days like to push into the two or even twoandahalf hour mark PERIOD

Many directors fail to realize quantity does not always equate to quality PERIOD Michael Bay anyone Fortunately  Hours is a fraction of its title with a run time of just  minutes PERIOD

The Oscar movie season is really just beginning PERIOD With likely frontrunners such as The Fighter Black Swan and The Kings Speech not out in wide release yet there is no way to predict how the chips will fall PERIOD

Still  Hours is definitely worthy of this cinematic horserace PERIOD If nothing else Franco deserves Best Actor for delivering a gutwrenching performance that is raw gritty and real PERIOD

He brings Ralstons incredible story to life and easily propels the film forward singlehandedly  pun still intended PERIOD
