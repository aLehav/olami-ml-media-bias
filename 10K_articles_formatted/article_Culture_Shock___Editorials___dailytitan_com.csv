Partly cloudy skies PERIOD Low 53F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



There is a war taking place in the heart of Los Angeles PERIOD

There is a clash of civilizations between minorities and the mainstream between subcommunities and the middle class PERIOD

Were talking about a multilayered complex conflict between minorities and the AngloSaxon community and inside of that there lies a minority vs PERIOD minority struggle PERIOD

The recent battle of the billboards in Los Angeles was a public display of the clash between the Latino community and the AngloSaxon community PERIOD Suddenly Spanish radio stations were playing ads in English when they hadnt before PERIOD American flags were draped ostensibly by patriotic citizens over the word Mexico in the billboard and talk radio was inundated with frustration over a lack of cultural assimilation PERIOD

The mayoral race put City Councilman Antonio Villaraigosa in office for four years which may only add to the heat PERIOD Though only a third of registered voters turned out to vote they did not vote for the incumbent they voted for the Latino challenger PERIOD

The new installment of a Latino figurehead could possibly only accentuate the divide between the minorities PERIOD Though black voters endorsed Villaraigosa in this campaign they havent stood together with the Latino community outside of this one election PERIOD

Mexican President Vincente Foxs recent comments claiming that Mexican immigrant workers in the US are willing to work jobs that blacks dont even want heightened the divide between the two groups in Southern California especially in Los Angeles PERIOD Rev PERIOD Al Sharpton demanded a public apology and instead got only an invitation to the presidents house to unite for the sake of minority rights PERIOD

But is this enough Maybe for the sake of international diplomacy it is but theres still a long way to go in LA PERIOD

The black flight from South Central LA is another indicator that would indicate otherwise PERIOD Middleclass black families have fled LA making room an influx of Mexican immigrants PERIOD The number of blacks in that community has dramatically dropped over the last decade and they will only continue to do so PERIOD

Villaraigrosa certainly has many battles to tackle but the sociocultural dilemma is one of the fiercest PERIOD The next four years will likely be defined by many clashes PERIOD Allegations of LAPD racial attacks and increased racial violence in local communities will also likely continue PERIOD

The challenge facing LAs new mayor is one that American politicians have long contended with PERIOD One major difference between the immigrant societies of Americas past and todays fractured communities is that the melting pot metaphor no longer seems to hold any credence PERIOD

A new model of local government must emerge one that is both representative and uniformly American whatever that means PERIOD Villaraigrosa must become everyones mayor and bridge the gap between the status quo and the groups that are rapidly ascending from minority status to majority rule PERIOD We at the Daily Titan wish him the best of luck PERIOD
