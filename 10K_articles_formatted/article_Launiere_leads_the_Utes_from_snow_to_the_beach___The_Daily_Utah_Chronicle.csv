The Utah womens volleyball team is getting out of the snow and heading to the beach PERIOD

The Utes have been invited to compete in the fourth annual Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship in Riverside Calif. along with seven other top programs from around the country PERIOD

It shows that we are considered one of the top teams in the country said head coach Beth Launiere PERIOD Its a reward for our team to be able to be in this position to get the chance to play against other top teams in the country in the spring8212its an experience valuable to our players development. although playing in the sand is a lot different from playing on a gym floor Launiere said beach volleyball improves indoor play on many different levels PERIOD

The difficulty of running and jumping in sand makes it great for conditioning while ball control and reading skills on defense have to improve because its harder to move quickly in the sand PERIOD Increasing understanding of the game and improving mental toughness are also advantages to playing on the sand PERIOD

There are just the two of you out there sometimes without coaches and the players have to figure out ways to win Launiere said PERIOD Your weaknesses get exposed more easily so mentally youve got to be able to handle the pressure of just you and another player. the Utes took advantage of some of last weeks nice weather and the weekend in Santa Barbara Calif. to get in some playing time in the sand PERIOD

Although the team has only played in the sand four times Launiere said her team has improved a lot during the course of a week and is ready for the tournament PERIOD

I think we are as prepared as we can be and theyve gotten a ton better in a week she said PERIOD Well go compete8212its not life or death8212but well go down there and compete and just have fun with it. the beach tournament is the last of three tournaments the Utes have played in the spring and marks the end of their spring season PERIOD

Despite having lost several games last weekend at the Santa Barbara tournament and some others at the Utah spring tournament the Utes have made a lot of progress since they began practicing again in January PERIOD

Its been really great for the development of our team. launiere said PERIOD We lost three seniors and weve had big role changes for everyone on the team and its taken all spring to adjust to that this past weekend was good because we lost a lot and players stepped up and learned how much different their roles will be in the fall PERIOD You dont learn that if you just go beat teams all the time. the Utes will be competing in the beach tournament all day Saturday as they face top programs such as Hawaii San Diego Texas Nebraska North Carolina Southern California and host school UCRiverside PERIOD
