With so many distractions in Plemmons Student Union its easy to miss the small rectangular table covered with treats and goodies located under the Venezuelan flag in the international hallway PERIOD A smiling man and woman sit at the table PERIOD The Listening Post is just as it sounds PERIOD It is open to any student or faculty member in need of a listening ear PERIOD

The listeners are not in the union to tell you what to do Mike Osbourne an avid volunteer and listener at The Listening Post said PERIOD Its to allow you to decide yourself by getting you to talk about it. we have neighbors who have done this for several years and were both alumni of Appalachian so its a way to give back volunteer Dorothy Osbourne said PERIOD

Many of the volunteers are App State alumni who have given their time and effort back to the school PERIOD When the volunteers were in school however the topic of mental health was not a subject of discussion PERIOD

If you were stressed out you didnt tell anybody volunteer Maurice Ewing said PERIOD

The Listening Post was founded in  at the University of Denver but it came to App State as a reaction to the  Columbine High School shooting according to A Rumple Minute for Mission. the idea was that if someone could have listened to the difficulties students were having then the tragedy could have been avoided PERIOD

The Listening Post volunteers can refer students or staff to proper mental health services if they feel they cannot handle their situation PERIOD Volunteers are also trained for any mental or physical emergency that may arise PERIOD

We had a young person come in who came and collapsed the first Thursday here Osbourne said PERIOD They didnt know what to do with him because we never had anything like that before. another incident occurred with an honorably discharged Marine with two tours of combat duty in the Middle East PERIOD He suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder and was considering suicide PERIOD After talking with the listener for a short time the young man abruptly arose to leave PERIOD The listener followed him down the hall stopped him from leaving the building and walked him straight to the counseling center where professional counselors assured his safety PERIOD

All of The Listening Post volunteers are trained on how to be active listeners and are given a rundown on the numerous campus services that help students in need including suicide prevention training and the counseling center PERIOD

The purpose of the Listening Post is to provide a safe nonjudgmental place for students or staff to talk about anything on their mind Ewing said PERIOD

Although The Listening Post volunteers are faced with many individuals wanting a solution to their problems they know each visitor has the answer to their own problem PERIOD The Listening Post believes that people need some encouragement to come up what they already know is the right answer Ewing said PERIOD

The Listening Post is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays between  a.m PERIOD and  p.m PERIOD at the Plemmons Student Union in the International Hall of Flags and on Wednesdays between  a.m PERIOD and  p.m PERIOD at Park Place Cafe in Trivette Hall PERIOD
