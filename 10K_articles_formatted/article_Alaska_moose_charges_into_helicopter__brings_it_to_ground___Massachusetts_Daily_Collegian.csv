ANCHORAGE Alaska  A helicopter is not necessarily a match for an angry moose PERIOD Instead of lying down after being shot with a tranquilizer dart a moose charged a hovering helicopter used by a wildlife biologist damaging the aircrafts tail rotor and forcing it to the ground PERIOD

Neither the pilot nor the biologist was injured but the moose was maimed by the spinning rotor and had to be euthanized wildlife officials said PERIOD

It just had to be one of those quirky circumstances PERIOD Even dealing with bears and goats and moose and wolves this is pretty unusual and truly a very unique situation said Doug Larsen regional supervisor for the Division of Wildlife Conservation PERIOD

Biologist Kevin White was aboard the chartered helicopter on Saturday for a study of moose near Gustavus a community of  people about  miles northwest of Juneau in southeast Alaska PERIOD Moose outnumber humans there 2to1 White has written in an essay for the Department of Fish and Game Web site PERIOD

He shot the animal with a tranquilizer dart Larsen said and the pilot maneuvered the helicopter to keep the animal from slipping into a tight space or collapsing in water and drowning PERIOD

The moose would start to move and then the helicopter would back off and try to keep the moose out in the open Larsen said PERIOD

But instead of moving toward open space the moose charged the helicopter PERIOD

As the animal got closer and closer to going down an animal sort of loses its thinking  its ability to rationalize whats in its best interest Larsen said PERIOD
