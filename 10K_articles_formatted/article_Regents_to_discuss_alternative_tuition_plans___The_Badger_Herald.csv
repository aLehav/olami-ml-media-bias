2778,2001-12-03,"if the UW Board of Regents hears what it would like to hear this weekend tuition may never increase the same way again PERIOD
In the boards monthly meeting this weekend the regents will eye the tuition increase trend and some of the optional policies they could adopt to help curb the ageold problem PERIOD
Ric Porreca senior vicechancellor and chief financial officer at the University of ColoradoBoulder will address the regents Thursday and explain the pros and cons of cohort tuition PERIOD
Cohort tuition is one of the many options the regents will discuss in the coming year to find ways to increase educational quality for students while maintaining the UW Systems resource base PERIOD
The plan would initiate a tuition freeze singly for each class which would maintain itself for four or five years without facing an increase meaning that a student would pay the same amount of tuition for four or five years as they did their freshman year PERIOD This tuition would be higher than current tuition PERIOD
Supporters say cohort tuition would make tuition more consistent over a students college career making longterm planning more manageable and encouraging students to graduate more quickly PERIOD
The board is also considering other tuition options that would be less of an overhaul of the entire system PERIOD For example they are considering installing a program that would charge tuition on a percredit basis rather than charging all fulltime students the same amount PERIOD
According to a university press release another way the regents are considering to increase revenue in the longrun would be a program that charged nonresidents lower tuition if they are the children of UW alumni PERIOD Supporters of this program claim that while it may mean the school would garner slightly less tuition money in the long run both the states braingain efforts and possible alumni support would be enhanced PERIOD
The regents will also consider a program that would charge tuition based on family income PERIOD In this scenario according to the press release students coming from families with higher income would pay higher tuition and vice versa PERIOD Supporters contend this program would increase revenue while providing equality based on students ability to pay PERIOD
Finally the regents will look at encouraging institutions to offer more courses to adults who may have their tuition reimbursed by employers PERIOD The plan would charge tuition for professional and niche programs aimed at adults at a level that would essentially make the programs selfsupporting PERIOD
All of these programs are part of a new yearlong executive study titled Building Our Resource Base that seeks alternative ways of bringing in revenue to UW PERIOD
Unpredictability in state support for public higher education makes it imperative that other sources of funding be developed the study states PERIOD
But the regents say they are not taking action yet PERIOD Rather they will spend the next year studying these alternatives PERIOD
Each of these options has pros and cons and some degree of risk or uncertainty in terms of actual revenue enhancement that might result the executive summary said PERIOD
Options that receive further study will brought to the table in the spring as considerations for future budget proposals PERIOD
