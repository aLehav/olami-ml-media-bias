One of my favorite commercials of all time is for Citibank credit cards PERIOD

A middleaged man dressed in a wifebeater and boxers holding a beer and sitting in a recliner lipsyncs as the teenage girls voiceover talks about how she stole someones personal information to go shopping for a leather bustier that 

The commercial implies that with Citibank credit cards customers are protected from identity theft PERIOD

More than  million U.S PERIOD veterans are probably wishing theyd been promised a similar type of reassurance from the Department of Veterans Affairs PERIOD

The New York Times reported Monday that 

Since the data was stolen from the employees home in Maryland during a random burglary articles initially reported it was possible the thief didnt know what he or she had in his or her possession but anyone with a modicum of technological knowledge  and by that I mean absolutely anyone  would be able to figure out the threetwofour number combination that identifies a Social Security number PERIOD

The Times stated that  but  just doesnt cut it PERIOD

The three pieces of information necessary to gain almost complete access to someones finances are name date of birth and Social Security number PERIOD With this burglary . million veterans are now at risk possibly for the rest of their lives since getting a new Social Security number is considerably more difficult than canceling credit cards PERIOD

So what methods of recourse do people have available anymore In our modern society which thrives almost exclusively on plastic and computerized records how can anyone truly be protected

One way to prevent potential security breaches from occurring is to simply limit the amount of personal information companies have access to PERIOD

Risks are inherent in transmitting any information online but limiting it to credit card numbers that can be canceled takes the more permanent types of personal data out of electronic circulation PERIOD

This method is not foolproof  no method completely is  so another option is to use the power of government for good rather than evil PERIOD

In February  thieves had managed to trick the worlds largest commercial data broker ChoicePoint into providing information on more than  customers as the Times article reported PERIOD

That incidence caused more consumerprotection laws to be introduced in Congress but 

Translation consumers are stuck PERIOD

Obviously Im no data systems security expert but even I can figure out that major security breaches  whether by sheer dumb luck on the parts of the thieves or incompetence on the parts of the businesses  are bad news PERIOD

The growing number of incidents of mass identity theft indicates that whatever current system is being used isnt working and something needs to be done  before commercials like Citibanks become eerie reality PERIOD
