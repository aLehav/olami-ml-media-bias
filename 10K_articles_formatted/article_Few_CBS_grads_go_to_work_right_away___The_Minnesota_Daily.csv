5089,2023-11-04,"students say the college aims only to prepare them for more school PERIOD

Published  December  

When Carah Kucharski receives her bachelors degree she plans to jump straight into the workforce PERIOD

But the University of Minnesota genetics cell biology and development senior said taking College of Biological Sciences classes to prepare her for work after graduation has been difficult because they arent focused on the industry PERIOD

In a  CBS Deans Office survey only about  percent of CBS seniors said an undergraduate degree was the highest degree they planned on earning PERIOD

Since the majority of CBS students plan to attend further schooling options for those who want to go straight into the workforce are advertised less Kucharski said PERIOD

I dont even know where to start in looking for internships she said PERIOD In the career center there are plenty of med school internships but not really for industry. about  percent of students surveyed by CBS said they plan to receive a professional degree after graduation PERIOD About  percent plan to earn a doctorate and  percent plan to earn a masters degree PERIOD

Career Center for Science and Engineering Director Mark SorensonWagner said counselors at the center help students prepare for further schooling or work after graduation  like suggesting they attend University career fairs to connect with people in industry PERIOD

Biochemistry senior Peter Gorman who hopes to work at Cargill after graduating said career fairs were helpful because he could figure out his options and meet industry recruiters in person PERIOD

But Kucharski said most CBS students overlook industry as a viable option for career or internship opportunities because they mainly concentrate on going to medical school PERIOD

CBS only focuses on the knowledge you need to know to get accepted somewhere else she said PERIOD

SorensonWagner said CBS students start from the point of view that theyll go on to further schooling whereas College of Science and Engineering students dont PERIOD

What we see a lot of especially for CSE the engineering students typically go straight into industry he said PERIOD I think that one of the struggles as well is a lot of CBS students coming in thinking they want to go into a prehealth field research etc. cBS offers a onecredit class called Biology Colloquium to students who are interested in learning about their career options PERIOD

A lot of freshmen come in thinking about med school associate biology professor Kathryn Hanna said PERIOD But a lot will change their mind PERIOD  Part of my goal is to show them careers theyve never heard of. each year about  students take the colloquium class Hanna said and about twothirds of the students are in CBS PERIOD

Professionals from different fields visit the class to talk about their work Hanna said and students take a field trip to a company PERIOD

Gorman who took the colloquium concurrently with his internship said the class helped him evaluate whether he wanted to continue in the field but his other biochemistry classes dont apply to his internship because theyre researchheavy PERIOD

Everything we study is pretty directed to going into med school he said PERIOD

Kucharski said she wished her classes would teach students how to apply their research to industry rather than just focus on the medical field or conducting basic research PERIOD

Biology senior McKenzie Fitzgerald said when she interned for the U.S PERIOD Army Corps of Engineers in Crofton Neb. she only needed a basis of ecology and she learned most skills in the field rather than in the classroom PERIOD

The career center is trying to teach students about other options by bringing in companies SorensonWagner said but its up to CBS students to consider other options beyond graduate or professional schools PERIOD

Before his internship experience at Medtronic biology junior Andrew Taylor said he was set on medical or dental school PERIOD

Experience in industry  its definitely changed my mind and perspective about opportunities available to CBS students he said PERIOD

Taylor said resources that students need to find internships and careers are there if they put in extra effort to find them PERIOD

Gorman and Taylor said they used GoldPASS a University networking database and attended career fairs to connect with potential employers PERIOD

Hanna said students could also connect with local companies through temporary staffing agencies a service the University doesnt provide PERIOD

Theres a whole other world out there she said PERIOD
