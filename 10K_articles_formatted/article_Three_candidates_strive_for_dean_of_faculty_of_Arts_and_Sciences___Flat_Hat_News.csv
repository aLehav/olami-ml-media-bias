The dean of Arts and Sciences position has been vacant since August  when Maria Donoghue Velleca stepped down two years after taking the role PERIOD Raitt who has served in the position since Jan PERIOD   held the first town hall on March  PERIOD Approximately  faculty staff and administration members attended the event inperson and over  joined via Zoom PERIOD

Were funny were smart were erudite were eclectic PERIOD But we dont have a structure right now that articulates and dramatizes all our strengths and all our differences Raitt said PERIOD

Raitt a cochair of the Steering Committee for Computing Data Science and Applied Science Initiative proposed an umbrella structure in which five schools  computing data and applied sciences creative and performing arts humanities social sciences and natural and lab sciences  would all fit under Arts and Sciences PERIOD

Raitt emphasized her deep institutional knowledge during the town hall PERIOD Since arriving at the College in  she has served in a number of positions including chair of the English department faculty representative to the Board of Visitors and vice dean for Arts Humanities and Interdisciplinary Studies PERIOD

Ive been here for a really long time Raitt said PERIOD I really like working here and I know that we can transform ourselves and move forward in a way that we want to do if we can build the right kind of culture with the right kind of leader. jackson held the second town hall on April  PERIOD According to Jackson her interest in working at the College stems from her undergraduate experience at Harvard University where she enjoyed being challenged and stretched across disciplines PERIOD

William and Mary is one of those really extraordinary places that combines a studentcentered liberal arts experience a real commitment to the transformations that happen during that experience with the energy and vitality of a research institution Jackson said PERIOD

As an archeologist and anthropologist Jackson argued that this combination of a liberal arts and a research oriented education produces empathetic students who are wellsuited for analyzing data PERIOD She also said that the key strengths she would like to build upon and advance as dean include fostering an environment that promotes creative thinking and building and furthering an inclusive community PERIOD

I am good at moving us from a space of talking consulting to starting to pull out threads pull out big ideas start to bring them together and say Hey lets start to think about what actions are going to come out of this how were going to make decisions about what will come next Jackson said PERIOD

Jackson also explained some of her ideas on how to build on the goals of Vision  prompting a faculty member present at the town hall to point out that the plan is a sore subject for some members PERIOD The faculty member cited an open letter that over  members signed which explained their concerns with the administration over being excluded from major decision making at the College PERIOD

Thomas held the final town hall on April  PERIOD Prior to his time at the University of NebraskaLincoln Thomas served as a professor of history at the University of Virginia PERIOD Throughout his career he has led efforts to promote digital humanities PERIOD

Im here today because in my view William and Mary is the leading public university committed to the arts and sciences to the liberal arts in teaching and research Thomas said PERIOD

Thomas described his experience working on an interdisciplinary project that brought together leaders from across the University of NebraskaLincoln system culminating in the creation of an animated film chronicling the largest attempted slave escape in United States history The Bell Affair. what Ive learned from that experience is how working together across disciplines and across colleges bringing different expertise to the table including working in and with communities involving graduate and undergraduate students at the heart of that project  changes everything Thomas said PERIOD

During each town hall faculty asked the candidates questions about building morale their leadership style and future plans for the College including Vision  and the potential school for computer data and applied science PERIOD Faculty also asked Jackson and Thomas about their relevant experiences in anticipation of the potential new school of computer data and applied sciences at the College PERIOD

Faculty and staff morale was another focal point of discussion during the town halls PERIOD Raitt discussed a time where she met with some staff members and the expressed their concerns as she was putting together a white paper on the strategic plan PERIOD

Theres a group of housekeepers who used to always have breakfast in the lunchroom in Tucker Hall where the English department lives Raitt said PERIOD I went and I had breakfast with them PERIOD I mean you know I asked if I could obviously PERIOD And we had a long conversation about the strategic plan PERIOD And I said to them What do you enjoy about coming to work And you know what they said They said going home. a faculty member at the town hall told Raitt that it felt like faculty and staff morale was at an all time low and added that it felt low in ways that may have a ripple effect across campus PERIOD

Raitt said that low morale is a difficult issue and may stem from the COVID19 pandemic and the significant number of transitions in the Dean of Arts and Sciences office PERIOD

Another faculty member present highlighted his concern over the future of humanities programs at the College PERIOD He noted his concern for whether the administrations decisions will benefit the College in the long run PERIOD He also pushed back on the notion that morale issues stem from the COVID19 pandemic and instead said that they are more linked to administrative overreach such as hiring decisions without consultation from the faculty PERIOD

The faculty member highlighted other issues such as research funding being taken from their department and bureaucratic issues in interdisciplinary studies PERIOD

There is a narrative out there that the humanities are dying and that nobody is signing up for the humanities majors Raitt responded PERIOD Ive looked at the numbers across the nation PERIOD Its not true PERIOD Its just not true PERIOD At William and Mary weve seen an increasing number of STEM majors and weve seen a decrease in the number of arts and humanities majors PERIOD What we have not seen is a decrease in the number of students who are desperate to get into the arts and humanities courses PERIOD And to me majors are nice and all but what really matters is that students can take courses outside of their major and most students who are STEM majors or econ majors whatever it might be are still really eager to take arts and humanities courses. raitt emphasized the importance of investing in the arts and humanities PERIOD

I would see it as my responsibility to our students and to a concept of the liberal arts and sciences education that is really expansive to invest in the arts and humanities Raitt said PERIOD You cant be a good scientist without believing in your own creative capacities PERIOD You cant be a good scientist without believing in your own imagination PERIOD I think our students know that. provost Peggy Agouris convened the Dean of Arts and Sciences Search Committee chaired by Law School Dean A PERIOD Benjamin Spencer and made up of faculty staff and students who whittled down the initial candidates to the final round PERIOD Agouris ultimately makes the decision to extend the job offer to the selected candidate PERIOD

I hope to be able to make an announcement by the end of April after I receive the search committees report review the community feedback and make the final decision Agouris wrote in an email to The Flat Hat PERIOD

An outside consulting firm Russell Reynolds Associates also helped facilitate the search process PERIOD

Agouris laid out which qualities she is looking for in a dean as she makes the final decision PERIOD

In essence I am looking for a passionate and proven leader who reflects William and Marys excellence and who will lead Arts and Sciences with vision as the institution evolves Agouris said PERIOD This important position collaborates with me and the other deans in addition to leading a team of capable vice and assistant deans and directors PERIOD It is an exciting time at William and Mary and we have an opportunity with a strong leader and partner to shape a sustainable future for and celebration of Arts and Sciences. save my name email and website in this browser for the next time I comment PERIOD
