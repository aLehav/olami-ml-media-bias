Showers early then partly cloudy overnight PERIOD Low around 50F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD Chance of rain  PERIOD

Updated November     pm



As a proud Seattleite and a Starbucks consumer I not only watched Starbucks rise to the top of the global coffee industry I helped make it happen PERIOD

Starbucks has become my library my meeting room and one of my favorite hangouts PERIOD Somehow for a person who doesnt have a caffeine addiction I always manage to find myself in or around one almost every day PERIOD

And thats exactly how its supposed to be according to Paola Tassara the managing director of design for licensed stores at Starbucks PERIOD

Tassara said one of the goals for Starbucks stores is to design spaces for human connection along with a place for our baristas to share coffee PERIOD

And one of those spaces will now be located in Suzzallo Library PERIOD

Thats right Suzzallo Espresso is no more PERIOD Starbucks is currently renovating the area to open their second official store on campus by the beginning of fall quarter  PERIOD

Suzzallo Library represents a very special project for us Tassara said PERIOD

As part of the reveal Starbucks invited a group of journalists from around the region to its headquarters in SoDo to discuss the new cafe and introduce its final design PERIOD

The gathering kicked off in an obvious fashion over samples of Starbucks highend Reserve coffee while Starbucks discussed its procedure for ethically sourcing its coffee beans from places around the world like the Congo and Sumatra PERIOD

Its absolutely essential that Starbucks invests in on the ground support said Julie Anderson the global responsibility manager at Starbucks PERIOD We have very high standards for quality. that standard of quality was clearly visible in their plans for Suzzallo PERIOD

The new coffeehouse a project three years in the making was specifically designed inhouse to suit the needs of college students PERIOD

This includes having spaces for group study and meetings along with an ATM a unisex bathroom and perhaps most importantly of all lots of electrical outlets PERIOD

The number of seats is expected to remain roughly the same but the seats will come in a variety of counter seating tables and couches PERIOD

There will be writing on the walls in different languages relating to the schools four columns Loyalty Industry Faith and Efficiency PERIOD Existing artwork in the building will also be used to pay homage to the UW PERIOD

Some design features like the choice to move the pastry case to the back of the store were specifically made with UW students in mind PERIOD The move is intended to prevent long lines of students from stretching out of the shop PERIOD

Weekly meetings with the university helped Starbucks understand when peak hours are throughout the day and helped influence modifications to create a space that adapts to those busy times PERIOD

The hope is that this store will help ease the long lines that plague the Starbucks in the HUB as well as build upon the partnership Starbucks and the UW have PERIOD

The new space will also feature Starbucks Reserve coffee becoming the one of the first stores in the UDistrict to carry the specialty brand PERIOD

The staff of the new shop will mostly consist of trained students employed by Housing and Food Services as well as any current employees whod like to switch to the more campusfriendly location PERIOD

Impressed as I was with the design and the dedication Starbucks gave to creating a space according to the needs of students I couldnt help but mourn for a minute at the loss of Suzzallo Espresso PERIOD

Hopefully itll kind of have the same vibe as the old one said Colin Albert a student at the UW PERIOD It was a good place for groups to study. the question is How many more coffee shops will we have to mourn If the whispers I hear on campus are correct then this might not be the last coffee shop to be converted into a Starbucks PERIOD

And though I support Starbucks revitalizing a part of Suzzallo Library that was admittedly bland I also support the small independent coffee shops that help give the UW some of its personality PERIOD They may all serve Starbucks coffee but they still feel more personal than the ubiquitous corporate behemoth that is behind the green siren PERIOD

Albert reiterated this sentiment and acknowledged that there certainly are a lot of them around already PERIOD

That being said we could do much worse than partnering with Starbucks which sponsors important programs at the UW like Husky Leadership Initiative and MLK Day of Service PERIOD And for a campus that is dedicated to supporting good working conditions and ethical sourcing worldwide it was clear from the presentation that Starbucks does better than most other companies PERIOD

But lets just keep it to this Starbucks PERIOD Ive always found that too much of a good thing can be grounds for a bitter end PERIOD
