A race of egotistical goldskinned aliens a dancing tree with a threeword vocabulary a socially awkward empath a sentient planet and a universelevel extinction event its just another day in the lives of StarLord and his ragtag crew in Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy Vol PERIOD . vol PERIOD  sees James Gunn return to the double role of writer and director after the wild success of his first film PERIOD Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Dave Bautista Bradley Cooper Vin Diesel and Michael Rooker also reprise their roles PERIOD Joining the cast are Pom Klementieff as Mantis the newest member of the Guardians Kurt Russell as Ego the father of main character StarLord and Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha better known as Kismet or simply Her from the comics PERIOD

Klementieff plays an alien who has emotional empathy strong enough to simply touch someone and know what they are feeling in vivid detail PERIOD The addition of Klementieffs character Mantis is one of the high points of the film PERIOD Several interactions between Mantis and Bautistas Drax are the funniest moments in a movie that is full of comedic scenes PERIOD

Similar to the original Vol PERIOD  is a more lighthearted affair than most of Marvels other films PERIOD Comedy remains the primary focus here but its not without some rather touching scenes PERIOD The first time around the movie was about a throwntogether team that forms friendships through its combined trials PERIOD This time its about the dysfunctional family they have become and their relationships with outside groups such as Yondus splinter faction of the Reavers or StarLords dad Ego PERIOD

There are a handful of great surprises sprinkled throughout the movie via unexpected cameos or popculture jokes that are just too great not to laugh at PERIOD

From a technical standpoint Gunns direction and the cinematography by Henry Braham are excellent PERIOD The action sequences can be very busy with the amount of onscreen movement but it never feels overwhelming PERIOD In several scenes the timing of motion is slowed down to allow viewers to bask in the carnage that is about to ensue PERIOD

A minor complaint about the movie is the over abundance of postcredit sequences PERIOD Guardians of the Galaxy Vol PERIOD  has five and none are of vital importance or reveal anything too shocking PERIOD While the credit scroll has more going on than most with random lines changing to I am Groot before appearing correctly its still a drag to be forced to sit through them for postcredit sequences PERIOD One of them is even a little headscratching as it flies in the face of information established in the first movie PERIOD

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol PERIOD  isnt breaking any new ground in this installment but that isnt necessarily a bad thing PERIOD The first film was wildly successful because of its charming characters with their often bizarre banter goofy stylistic sensibilities and bombastic action sequences PERIOD All of those elements are back in spades this time around PERIOD
