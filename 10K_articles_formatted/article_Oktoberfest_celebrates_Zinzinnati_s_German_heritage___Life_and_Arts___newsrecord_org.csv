Each year Oktoberfest Zinzinnati attracts people of all ages with its exceptional German food beer music and entertainment PERIOD The event is a threeday celebration of all things German held in Downtown Cincinnati and is the secondlargest Oktoberfest festival in the world PERIOD

The event was held for its forty-first consecutive year this past weekend and judging by the grandeur of the festival it is not surprising that it has stood the test of time PERIOD

From the huge crowds to the wacky entertainment events to the outlandish yet delicious cuisine it is safe to say there is nothing generic about Oktoberfest Zinzinnati PERIOD

Many attendees showed off their German spirit through their clothing choices dressing in full lederhosen and suspenders PERIOD Others contributed to the energy of the celebration by openly embracing the culture that surrounded them PERIOD

Secondyear UC student Michael Palte was particularly impressed by the passion and enthusiasm possessed by the attendees PERIOD

The crowd here has been amazing PERIOD Everyone is so lively and energetic it really makes everything more enjoyable when the crowd is into it Palte said PERIOD

The crowd was willing to participate in many of the somewhat bizarre events of Oktoberfest such as a dachshund race  fittingly titled The Running of the Weiners  and the Gemuetlichkeit Games PERIOD Though these might sound odd at first the spirit and enthusiasm of those participating made it hard not to become invested in them PERIOD

Perhaps one of the most bizarre events is the Worlds Largest Chicken Dance PERIOD It is exactly what it sounds like thousands of people gathering together to do the Chicken Dance PERIOD It is a unique tradition that started in  when participants broke the world record for the largest Chicken Dance PERIOD

Live music is also a staple of Oktoberfest and this year impressively featured over  musical acts PERIOD Children and adults alike clapped and danced without care as traditional German melodies echoed through downtown Cincinnati PERIOD

While all of this may sound like a bit much for Oktoberfest newcomers there is enough to do and see that everyone can enjoy PERIOD

As firsttime Oktoberfest participant Karleigh Smith found out simply being in the environment of the festival is enough to stay entertained PERIOD

I was a little hesitant to come at first but Ive honestly had so much fun listening to all of the music and watching all of the people with my friends Smith said PERIOD The beer was just a bonus. oktoberfest might be best known for the incredible German foods and beers that it offers PERIOD Sauerkraut balls potato pancakes cream puffs bratwursts metts and strudels were just a few of the crowd favorites that were abundant throughout the festival PERIOD There was also no shortage of craft beers to choose from including Weihenstephaner Great Lakes and Cincinnati favorite Rhinegeist PERIOD

Oktoberfest Zinzinnati is a beloved Cincinnati tradition and brings in more than  attendees each year PERIOD Cincinnati native Nick Ewan a loyal Oktoberfest fan expressed his admiration for the festival this year PERIOD

The first time I came was when I was  and I havent missed one since Ewan said PERIOD I think everyone needs to experience it at least once. giant cream puffs line shelves at Oktoberfest Zinzinnati Friday Sept PERIOD   PERIOD Maddie Evans  Contributor
