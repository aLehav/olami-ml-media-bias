405,2023-10-23,"when the Utah football team took on South Florida back on Oct PERIOD  the Ute defense kept the Bulls off the scoreboard for the games first  minutes and  seconds before USF quarterback Marquel Blackwell hit receiver Brian Fisher with a 7yard scoring strike PERIOD
With that touchdown the Us quest for its first shutout of the year was ruined and the Bulls went on to add another pair of scores against the U scrubs PERIOD
Well now that Utah whomped Wyoming this past Saturday by a  margin and earned that longsoughtafter shutout several Utes credited USF with an assist PERIOD
After all not only did the Bulls provide motivation by coming tantalizingly close to putting up a gooseegg of their own only to yank it away but they provided a model for the Utes to follow against the Cowboysas both USF and Wyoming run hurryup no huddle offenses predicated around a spread passing attack PERIOD
This year playing South Florida first really helped because they run a similar offense to what Wyoming does said Utah coach Ron McBride PERIOD
And though the Utes assuredly would have been satisfied with the win even had Wyoming got a scoreYou can live with anything where you get more points than the other team McBride saiddont think for a second that the teams defenders werent hoping for a shutout especially after Utah destroyed Wyoming  in Laramie during the  season PERIOD
The defense stepped it up throughout the whole week of practice PERIOD So to shutout our first team of the season its just exciting for the defense said sophomore open end Jason Kaufusi PERIOD
Their offensive colleagues noticed their demeanor in wanting to keep the Cowboys at zero PERIOD
Our defense stepped up to the challenge PERIOD They wanted a shutout and thats what they got said senior halfback Dameon Hunter PERIOD Everyone was hungry for the shutout so nobody held anything back. the defenses effortsespecially in the last few weekshave been readily apparent PERIOD Based largely on strong performances against the Cowboys Bulls and New Mexico Lobos the U defense is now first in the MWC in both scoring defense allowing . points per game and total defense . ypg PERIOD
Then again the offense hasnt exactly been slouching off either PERIOD The Utes are second in the conference behind only BYU in both points . and yards . per game PERIOD
Utah is the only team in the league to rank first or second in all four of those categories and along with the Cougars is one of just two teams in the Mountain West to be undefeated against conference opponents PERIOD
Based on the strong efforts on both sides of the ball the Utes have outscored their past three opponents by a combined margin of  and have won four games in a row overall to improve to   MWC PERIOD
And as they prepare to go to Fort Collins Colo. to take on preseason favorite Colorado State this coming Saturday they say theres more still yet to come PERIOD
I dont think were up to our full capabilities yet Hunter said PERIOD Were capable of a lot more than that PERIOD Weve only started getting it going now in the second half of the season. emailprotected
