2202,2022-03-16,"alexander Fiterstein is currently one of the most acclaimed clarinet players in the world of classical music PERIOD He has played with countless classical superstars has received an array of outstanding reviews and in  was one of five recipients of the highly soughtafter Avery Fisher Career Grant PERIOD Given his reputation and the highly compelling program of the concert his performance at Mandel Hall titled Alexander Fiterstein and Friends came with hopelessly high expectations PERIOD Needless to say he and his chamber group did not disappoint PERIOD

The night started with Weinbergs Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op PERIOD  a piece that showcased Fitersteins dynamic range and his warm lyrical tone exceptionally well PERIOD Fiterstein noted that the work had been written by a composer whose family was killed in the Holocaust during World War II PERIOD The piece is tremendously difficult on the clarinet requiring extreme stamina and a strong sense of contrast for proper effect PERIOD Fiterstein executed even the most difficult virtuosic sections with profound grace refusing to compromise his phrasing or tone at any moment PERIOD The folky sections were lively and full of surprising yet welcome choices of articulation driving them forward and giving them an inherent sense of direction while the quiet moments were intimate and rife with absolutely gorgeous phrasing PERIOD The last minute of the second movementa transitory section where the intricate folk melodies and ghostly harmonies of the movement fade away into a few desperate clarinet notes with tensionheightening chords underneathwas a favorite moment in the program due to Fitersteins breathtaking piano PERIOD However pianist Michael Browns forte was annoyingly noisy and legato was severely lacking PERIOD All in all however the piece was a great appetizer for the performances main course PERIOD

The second piece of the night was the wellknown Quatuor pour la fin du temps by Olivier Messiaen PERIOD Also known by its English title Quartet for the End of Time the work was written by the composer while in German captivity as a prisoner of war in  PERIOD The piece is known for its vigorously dark theme and uncommon instrumentation at the time of its writing featuring a clarinet violin cello and piano PERIOD Premiered in a prisonerofwar camp and performed by fellow prisoners the piece has become one of Messiaens most recognized compositions and stands as a powerful message of art and faith in the face of war and violence PERIOD

For Messiaens Quartet for the End of Time Brown and Fiterstein were joined by Elena Urioste and Nicholas Canellakis on violin and cello respectively PERIOD Quartet for the End of Time is one of the hallmark pieces composed in the twentieth century PERIOD It is a grand allencompassing work the central goal of which is to separate music from the confines of time PERIOD A great performance of the piece requires an almost absurd amount of contrastdynamic and otherwiseand absolute cooperation between all members of an ensemble PERIOD In response to a UChicago Presents interview question about his fellow musicians Fiterstein affirmed his confidence in them and the importance of trusting each other because if youre playing for the first timemany times it works but it helps that youve rehearsed to a point where you have a certain level of comfort when you go on stage. fiterstein and Friends gave a striking performance of this legendary piece PERIOD Previously uninteresting parts of the piece sudenly became some of the most thoughtprovoking sections PERIOD The group coalesced into one entity the sounds of distinct instruments bouncing off each other spectacularly and creating an atmosphere of transcendence among the audience PERIOD The music was in the truest sense of the word transportive PERIOD A bad or mediocre performance of this piece can feel long monotonous and rather dull PERIOD But Fiterstein Urioste Canellakis and Brown brought Messiaens otherworldly aims to life and let the music escape from the temporal realm PERIOD

While the entire performance was nearly flawless the solo movements were the highlights of the piece PERIOD During the solo clarinet movement Abme des oiseaux Abyss of Birds Fiterstein showed what he is truly capable of with his warm vocal tone resonating beautifully on every note with spotless intonation PERIOD He used silence to great effect slightly exaggerating each of the moments of rest so that the sound had a chance to dissipate completely PERIOD When he came back from one of these long rests his crescendos were so lengthy and gradual that the sound seemed like it was crawling out of the depths of an abyss PERIOD By beginning each note with a quiet harmonicslike tone and gradually increasing its volume to thunderous extremes Fiterstein demonstrated his masterful and unmatched control of dynamics on the clarinet PERIOD

Equally extraordinary was the final movement and violin solo Louange  limmortalit de Jsus Praise to the Immortality of Jesus in which Urioste gave a passionate and moving delivery of the pieces conclusion PERIOD Throughout the performance the four musicians paid careful attention to balance and blend always ensuring that no instrument rose above the others PERIOD It was in ensemble playing that Canellakis uniquely demonstrated his talent in the higher register of the cello managing to maintain a dominant presence for the entire duration of the performance. canellakis bathed his performance in vibrato making the instrument sound as if it were weeping or lamenting PERIOD Michael Brown played calmly and with a beautiful tone in the background never distracting the audience from the lead instrument but instead providing lush harmonic context for the languid melodic figures PERIOD

It is no exaggeration to say that Alexander Fiterstein and friends transported the audience at Mandel Hall out of time for the entire  minutes of the Quartet for the End of Time. fiterstein is modest in his playing not allowing his virtuosity to eclipse the music itself PERIOD Instead his virtuosity and profound musical sensibility heighten the music he plays to an unmatched level PERIOD While the performance was sublime to say the least it is the underlying message of melancholic retrospection and artistic resistance against the onslaught of injustice that will remain with the audience long after the violins last note PERIOD
