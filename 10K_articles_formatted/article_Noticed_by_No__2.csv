Yet again Michiganders are getting screwed over by the politicians  a couple weeks ago John McCains camp turned its back on the state of Michigan PERIOD You could argue its a tactical decision you could say its for the best but ultimately theres no denying it leaves a bad taste in the mouth PERIOD With hardly any reservations McCain and his cronies have shut away the significant portion of Michiganders who support him and moved on to what they deem to be more essential states PERIOD

What a surprise PERIOD In January the Democrats did their part in minimizing the importance of this state with the debacle that was the Michigan Democratic primary and now nine months later the Republicans are doing the same by literally retreating PERIOD Things have come full circle for Michigan but not in the way we would like PERIOD

Through all of this however there has been one significant voice of reason sounding from the trenches of the Right PERIOD In an interview with Fox News vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin said this of the McCain camps decision to pull out of Michigan I read that this morning and I fired off a quick email and said Oh come on you know do we have to Do we have to call it there

While its telling that the McCain camp didnt even bother to share its plans with Palin and I hardly think she would make much of a difference without McCain by her side I still want her here PERIOD In fact I would love to just hear her oftimitated voice addressing the students somewhere on campus PERIOD

But more than that I want the problems in this state to be treated with the urgency and attentiveness with which they should be PERIOD Its a travesty McCain has conceded this state PERIOD Under the auspices of a Democratic governor Michigans economy has sagged to an incredible low with manufacturing employment dropping considerably over the course of the decade and the number of foreclosures increasing across the state PERIOD

McCains decision to pull out was influenced by the significant lead Obama has taken especially since the Wall Street crisis PERIOD No doubt many Republicans in Michigan are defending his decision PERIOD But this notion that forgetting Michigan and turning to other states McCains campaign will benefit in the long run is just astounding PERIOD This is the attitude a presidential candidate should take toward one of the most troubled states in the country And Republican Michiganders would rather see him turn his energy to Ohio than to their own state I dont get it PERIOD

Meanwhile you can say what you want about Palin PERIOD For the past month or so Ive remained largely indifferent to her though I have been both repulsed and amused in equal measures by how much this governor from Alaska has been degraded and demonized in the media PERIOD One particularly vivid example springs to mind In an article in Rolling Stone contributor Matt Taibbi called her a symbol of everything that is wrong with the modern United States likening her to the dream girl of a fat fucking pig who pins Country First buttons on his man titties and chants USA USA at the top of his lungs. wow PERIOD

Taibbis venomous rant aside the most obvious point of concern with Palin is her lack of experience PERIOD Shes often seen merely as the embodiment of the cynical manipulative and pandering tactics of the McCain camp PERIOD But at least the woman sees Michigan as more than a bunch of percentage points PERIOD

This may sound banal or nave PERIOD But this isnt so much about partisan politics as it is about Michigan itself and the people from this state who have undergone incredible hardships over the past few years PERIOD The politicians  Democrats Republicans whoever  have the responsibility to come here and talk to them PERIOD So why not invite Palin to speak on campus if she wants to come Her presence wouldnt make much of an impact in the long run though it would cause a raucous here which I would enjoy and the Democrats probably have Michigan in the bag PERIOD But nonetheless she like her running mate should be expected to address the issues that matter to the people in this state PERIOD Because ultimately theyre the issues that matter to Americans in general right now PERIOD

Like her or not Sarah Palin has at least recognized this PERIOD She has extended her hand to Michiganders and said Your state matters. political views aside we  students professors Ann Arborites whoever  should acknowledge her and say Yeah youre right. brandon Conradis can be reached at brconradumich.edu PERIOD
