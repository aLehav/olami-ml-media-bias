 February  marks the beginning of the National Eating Disorder Awareness Week PERIOD This week is often overlooked and forgotten which is unfortunate PERIOD Eating disorders are very serious and affect more people than one might expect PERIOD According to Nationaleatingdisorder. february  marks the beginning of the National Eating Disorder Awareness Week PERIOD

This week is often overlooked and forgotten which is unfortunate PERIOD

Eating disorders are very serious and affect more people than one might expect PERIOD

According to Nationaleatingdisorder.org over half of teenage girls and around onethird of boys will go to an unhealthy measure in order to prevent weight gain including vomiting smoking and laxatives PERIOD

The site also said that  percent girls between the ages of  to  are sometimes or very often on diets PERIOD

Other startling statistics state that  percent of  yearolds are afraid of being fat and  percent of first through third graders want to be thinner PERIOD

This shows that there is a definite problem in todays society and the way we view weight PERIOD

Weight is too much of a focal point in media and should be lessened PERIOD  Instead of thinness being stressed in  the media healthiness should be PERIOD

First through third graders shouldnt be  wanting to get thinner they should just be enjoying being a kid PERIOD

And its not just kids that struggle with this illness many adults do too PERIOD

Thats why we think this week is so important PERIOD  It brings  awareness to how many people are actually suffering with this illness and offers help PERIOD

So dont scoff and say this is just another stupid week PERIOD  Help spread the word and the importance of a healthy body image PERIOD
