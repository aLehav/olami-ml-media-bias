When you think of The University of Texas you think of Texas sports the passionate fanbase and the sea of burnt orange with their horns up at any given sports event PERIOD We are an institution of higher education first but the emphasis on athletics is continuously battling for top priority PERIOD

Weve won  national championships since  PERIOD Weve won  regularseason conference titles PERIOD UT studentathletes have gone on to win  Olympic medals PERIOD We even have nine studentathlete Rhode Scholars PERIOD All these statistics are proudly displayed on the UT Facts  Figures page right next to academics and research statistics PERIOD

UTs administration cares about academics as much as the next school but there is no denying that its athletics program gives our school a wellknown name diehard supporters and most of all money PERIOD

Even with the COVID19 pandemic limiting spectator attendance at sporting events Texas Athletics still made . million in profit for the  athletic year according to the Austin AmericanStatesman PERIOD However that number is nothing compared to the expenses generated by the athletic department every year PERIOD In the same athletic year Texas Athletics spent . million on things like scholarships coaches salaries and benefits and team travel according to the Austin AmericanStatesman PERIOD

Although college athletics is a huge moneymaking business studentathletes do not get paid a cent PERIOD Our studentathletes are expected to be fulltime students and fulltime athletes at one of the top schools in the country PERIOD

They must perform well both in the classroom and on the field while also managing the general stress of college PERIOD

In this forum we hear from two studentathletes about their experiences at UT PERIOD
