About two weeks after a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in East Palestine Ohio residents who had evacuated are coming back home PERIOD So is journalist Evan Lambert after his arrest at a press conference with Ohios governor PERIOD Police on the scene accused him of talking while the governor was talking but in a video of the scene from WKYC Studios Lambert said he was just doing his job PERIOD

The train derailment has introduced carcinogenic chemicals such as vinyl chloride and other flammable gases to the soil system and water systems according to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA PERIOD While residents are only facing ailments like headaches and irritated skin there are concerns about longterm health risks if the affected area isnt thoroughly cleaned up PERIOD Some animals including foxes chickens and over  fish in the area have already died PERIOD

Its up to journalists to be on every side of an event like this one PERIOD Its journalists who break down the science in simple terms so every reader can understand the consequences of this train derailment PERIOD Its journalists who advocate for the community affected by telling their stories in the midst of a much larger one PERIOD Its journalists who will hold all entities involved accountable for their commitments to rectifying this situation PERIOD

There couldnt be a redder flag than a journalist getting arrested at a press conference simply trying to cover the developments in Ohio for the benefit of the people PERIOD

Lambert was charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest but the charges were dropped this Wednesday PERIOD Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost stated there was insufficient evidence for either of these charges Lambert was in the middle of a live report when the governor began speaking and he stopped filming as soon as he realized PERIOD That was all it took for four police officers to remove him from the room and put him on his stomach PERIOD

Lambert said it wasnt lost on him that as a person of color his police interaction couldve been worse PERIOD Yost also acknowledged the importance of journalists on the ground when there are class action lawsuits governmental cleanup plans and local residents who want their voices to be heard PERIOD

Since the train derailment debacle began TikTok users have been instrumental in relaying the facts and inperson perspectives to wider audiences PERIOD Videos and their comments alike wonder why more news  on both mass and local scales  arent publishing more news about Ohio on their front pages PERIOD The ongoing problems continue to be documented by all major news organizations but the arrest of even one reporter should cause concern PERIOD

A free press is essential to the wellbeing of the people but especially vulnerable communities facing threats to their health and surrounding environment PERIOD The future of East Palestine Ohio depends on how journalists tell its story and how many people have access to the information PERIOD

I am a senior French and Earth Systems Science double major from St PERIOD Louis MO PERIOD When Im not wearing my EIC hat I am also a Chapel  Spiritual Life Fellow.. PERIOD
