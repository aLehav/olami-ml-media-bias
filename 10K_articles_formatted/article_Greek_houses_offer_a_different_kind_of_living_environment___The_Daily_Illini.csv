Though counterparts of the Greek system the lifestyles differ greatly when comparing a fraternity with a sorority PERIOD

Both sororities and fraternities make being alone an almost impossible task PERIOD To Mike Picardi senior in LAS and a member of Delta Chi fraternity this is a positive aspect of living in a house PERIOD

I worked at Kams as a bartender and I would sometimes get home at four in the morning and I could do a lap around the house and there would always be someone to chill with Picardi said PERIOD

While some might compare a Greek house with a dormitory Picardi found it much better PERIOD



A lot of people think they wouldnt want to live with that many guys but I didnt regret a minute of it Picardi said PERIOD

Jake Gold sophomore in AHS and a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity said that while sorority houses seem like a much nicer environment the rules seem much stricter and might resemble parents being present PERIOD

Its a whole lot of fun living in a house full of  guys and even though its hard to get things done I wouldnt change it Gold said PERIOD

While fraternities generally have some sort of alumni advisor to check in on their behavior sororities usually have house moms who have a much larger role PERIOD Delta Zetas house mom is always there to help the girls with daily issues even if its talking to a member after a bad day PERIOD

Shes always here to take care of us and shes pretty much like our mom said Jenny Tumba junior in LAS PERIOD

Tumba is currently living in her house for her second and last semester PERIOD

She loves the clean homey atmosphere of her Urbana house and says that when fraternity men come into her house they often comment on how nice it looks PERIOD

While many Greek stereotypes are false the cleanliness of fraternity houses does generally seem less than desirable PERIOD

Theres times when a girl will come in the house and be disgusted but when theres more than two guys living in the same place you cant have it clean  percent of the time Picardi said PERIOD

Because its up to the men to keep their houses clean it can be a struggle to keep it looking nice PERIOD

Gold mentioned that while his house is always the place for a good time it can often be filthy PERIOD

Its not something I want to show my mom Gold said PERIOD

While both Delta Chi and Delta Tau Delta fraternity members are in charge of cleaning their homes Tumba said that the Delta Zeta sorority has daily visits from a cleaning lady PERIOD

Though living in her sorority house has proved to be a good time Tumba looks forward to her move into an apartment next year PERIOD

Its fun living with all of these people but Im more mature now and I want my own independent area Tumba said PERIOD

While theyre a part of the same community fraternity and sorority living areas seem to be quite opposite PERIOD

Living in an apartment can give students space of their own but Greek homes seem to house camaraderie that cannot be found elsewhere PERIOD",Greek houses offer a different kind of living environment - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
