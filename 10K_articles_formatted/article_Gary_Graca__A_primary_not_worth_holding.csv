Congratulations to the estimated . million voters who made the trip to the polls yesterday for Michigans primary Courtesy of the Democratic and Republican National Committees you participated in a meaningless and counterproductive election PERIOD

Forgive me for being a little undemocratic but Michigan would have been better off if it hadnt held a primary at all PERIOD Taking this year off would have saved the state millions of dollars and left Michigan as uncharted territory for the general election PERIOD Instead of becoming a bottomfeeder scrapping for any kind of primary influence it could muster Michigan could have been a leader in the beauty pageant of swing states come spring PERIOD

Sure the founding fathers might be collectively rolling over in their graves at the idea of a state government voluntarily disenfranchising its citizens in an election but consider this The DNC and RNC basically already did so PERIOD The DNC stripped all of Michigans delegates to the Democratic National Convention because it leapfrogged its primary into January PERIOD The RNC slapped Michigan on the wrist by stripping half of its delegates PERIOD All Michigans state legislature had to do to sell the disenfranchisement was play the blame game PERIOD

Although they are usually free in the sense that citizens have the ability to support candidates without fear of political retribution what many people forget about free and fair elections is that they dont come cheap PERIOD Despite having less than half its delegates Michigan still paid full price for the election which is expected to add up to an estimated  million and could end up costing even more PERIOD

A costly but meaningless election shouldnt go over well with cashstrapped Michiganders PERIOD The state legislature didnt need to shell out another  million to hold an election for two political parties that wouldnt even save its seat at the national nominating conventions PERIOD Nothing obligates Michigan to hold primary elections PERIOD

Some argue though that Michigans primary was important regardless of whether it would be represented at the conventions PERIOD The key feature in this argument is momentum PERIOD Thanks to Michigan voters nativeson Republican candidate Mitt Romney received the first big victory of his underachieving campaign PERIOD

But momentum isnt as pivotal if its expected and Michigans results fit the script perfectly PERIOD With John Edwards and Barack Obama absent from the ballot Hillary Clinton was a shoein for the win PERIOD The media might have built up John McCain as a threat to Romney but realistically he was always a long shot PERIOD Romney has too many Michigan connections PERIOD His father George Romney was a popular governor here in the 1960s and young Mitt grew up here PERIOD You cant beat the hometown boy PERIOD

Maybe what Michigan wanted yesterday wasnt about results or influence PERIOD Maybe it just wanted a little attention which it got PERIOD Michigan was briefly courted in the national spotlight like it had so selfishly desired when it moved its primary ahead of New Hampshire PERIOD

However its a stretch to say that candidates were taking Michigan seriously PERIOD On the Republican side Romney McCain and Mike Huckabee managed to find time in the last two days to parrot a few stump speeches across the state PERIOD Bowing to party pressure none of the major Democratic candidates even bothered to show up PERIOD Michigans exposure wasnt even close to the months of doortodoor canvassing with which all of the major candidates including Democrats swooned Iowans PERIOD Rivaling Iowa and New Hampshire was the goal of holding Michigans primary early and it turned out to be a failure PERIOD

Voters probably unknowingly tipped their hand in a different way too PERIOD Included in the law establishing the new primary date is a section that allows the DNC and RNC access to lists of the people who voted in their respective primaries PERIOD For parties in a state without partisan registration this is a wealth of useful information when trying to decipher voting trends the legality of which was upheld by the Michigan Supreme Court in November  PERIOD

If Michigan had skipped the primary and held out until the general election it would have been a mystery state PERIOD It would have been more difficult to gauge whether the state would go Democrat or Republican support Clinton or turn against her buy into Obamas message of hope or discard him and identify with Romneys Michigan roots or see his fraudulence PERIOD These answers arent always easy to find in opinion polls because they depend on people not only caring but also caring enough to act PERIOD But we got partial answers to these questions yesterday which ruins our mystique a little PERIOD

The sad truth is not having a primary would have been better than having half of one PERIOD
