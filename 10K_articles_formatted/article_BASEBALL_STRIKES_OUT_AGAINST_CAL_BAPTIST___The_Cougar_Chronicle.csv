COUGARS LOSE THREE HEARTBREAKERS IN SERIES

MICHAEL RAWSON
SPORTS EDITOR

The Cal State San Marcos baseball team played their hearts out in a threegame weekend series against  Cal Baptist but came away emptyhanded PERIOD

In game one at home junior San Diego City College transfer Adam Bileckyj pitched brilliantly shutting out the Lancers through  innings and allowing just one hit PERIOD But the Cougars never mustered a run and eventually fell  PERIOD Lancers starter Drew Madrigal quieted the Cougars through  innings and Erik Wallace finished the job with  scoreless to seal the win PERIOD

Games two and three were away at Cal Baptist PERIOD This time the Cougars would find ways to manufacture more runs but so would their opponent PERIOD The Lancers took game one  coming back from a  deficit PERIOD CSUSM scored one run in the first and two in the sixth on RBI hits by Johnny Omahen and Trent Jemmett PERIOD But the Lancers answered with  runs in the bottom of the sixth to take the lead that would hold for the victory PERIOD The Lancers then stole the backandforth second contest  on two ninthinning hit by pitches by Omahen PERIOD CSUSM will look to return to their winning ways against Point Loma Nazarene on Tuesday PERIOD
