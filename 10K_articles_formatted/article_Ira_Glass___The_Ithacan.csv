6808,2023-07-26,"i love Ira Glass the host of the famous radio show This American Life PERIOD I started listening to it when I came to college after the suggestion of a former English teacher PERIOD I subscribe to the free podcast off iTunes so it automatically downloads every week PERIOD

Since I popped my podcast cherry if you will I have become addicted PERIOD I now listen to multiple radio shows including WNYCs Radio Lab and Freakonomics PERIOD I have even converted my roommate over to the darkside as we fall asleep most nights with the sounds of Ira Glass or Jad Abumrad draining out our thoughts PERIOD

In one of my production classes we have to write and host a fiveminute talk show to practice our use of Protools PERIOD I took this assignment to mean that I can host my own podcast which I chose to do on the convenience of sustainability in college PERIOD

Despite changing the assignment to fit what I want to do I cannot be more excited to host a minipodcast PERIOD The only issue is if I want to keep my topic or do one of the many others I have fantasized about suggesting to Iraif and when as meet and become best friends PERIOD
