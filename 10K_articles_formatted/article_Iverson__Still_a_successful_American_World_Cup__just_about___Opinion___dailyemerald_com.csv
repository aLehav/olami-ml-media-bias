7643,2022-12-01,"opinion A sputtering and naive performance against a threetime finalist should not fully take away from the growth this young team has on the horizon PERIOD They may yet catch up with the womens team someday PERIOD



Who wanted to win the World Cup in Qatar anyway Thats why the U.S PERIOD Mens National Team in a sign of solidarity against all human rights violations in this tournament protested their final game and refused to defend PERIOD Thats why we let a late runner go unmarked to score on three separate occasions PERIOD Im proud we took a stand against intolerance and it should be noted that the Netherlands did not show the same support for the cause PERIOD

Our campaign was unfortunately over when Christian Pulisic couldnt finish the games first chance PERIOD The first goal is always crucial in any knockout game even more so against this Dutch side PERIOD

If we had grabbed the first the Netherlands would have had to commit bodies forward and concede space in their defensive midfield PERIOD That would allow players like Weston Mckennie and Brendon Aaronson real estate and time to drive further at the Dutch defense creating more chances PERIOD When the Dutch scored they were more than comfortable sitting back with Virgil Van Dijk to defend crosses and overloading the midfield bogging down any advances PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD was haunted by the chances not taken through all four games PERIOD The absence of an established striker who can finish chances was an apparent hole in this roster PERIOD Sargent Ferreira and Wright apart from one inexplicable flickup were largely uninvolved and far from clinical in the final third PERIOD One of those names or one that didnt make the plane will need to step forward and produce goals if this team is to take the next step to become an international contender PERIOD

That step forward is not that far away anymore PERIOD Despite shrinking when faced with the towering standard of that level Saturday this tournament was still a success for the USMNT they did what was expected of them PERIOD

It wasnt quite an escape from the group of death like in  but making it out was no small feat PERIOD We allowed one goal in three games off one bonehead penalty held the Three Lions in a zoo for the second match and stepped up and won against Iran when we needed nothing less PERIOD Only  teams in the entire world got to the spot we did PERIOD

Tyler Adams put himself in the conversation of worldclass holding midfielders and leaders covering about . of the Earths surface over the course of four games PERIOD I counted his steps trust me PERIOD Tim Ream was rocksolid throughout keeping the likes of Gareth Bale Harry Kane Mehdi Taremi and a redhot Cody Gakpo quiet should not be ignored even if his career internationally is at an end PERIOD Matt Turner kept us in games multiple times and his distribution was a welcome bonus PERIOD Yunus Musah was industrious at times PERIOD McKennie Aaronson and Tim Weah showed they can be spark plugs PERIOD

There are players that with improvement in four years will solidify the team PERIOD Antonee Robinsons marauding runs forward helped create space up front PERIOD If he finds a gear other than first and sixth and can pick his head up to supply that space he will be effective for more than just covering ground PERIOD Sergio Dest was a good outlet going forward and if he becomes more reliable defensively he could very well become the star he was tipped to be PERIOD If McKennie finds his shooting boots at some point he could quickly become one of the more complete midfielders in the world PERIOD

Cristian Pulisic came in with lofty expectations strapped on him as the face of the team PERIOD He wasnt perfect but he was still our best player creatively and showed bravery and determination I wasnt sure he had PERIOD He proved that he still has his potential with him and hopefully soon hell find a club that will give him the experience he needs PERIOD Those four years will hopefully be healthy for him and his costar Giovanni Reyna as well PERIOD

I had my doubts about coach Gregg Berhalter going into the tournament and I assume I still will PERIOD However he got all his lineups right and aside from a few questionable substitutions he brought this team to the highest ceiling possible PERIOD

This campaign will mean more to the nation than just a knockout stage appearance PERIOD This generation of players was galvanized by the runs made in  and  and they are much younger than both of those squads PERIOD They will be back and the nation getting stirred up in this run will pave the way for the generation coming up directly behind them PERIOD

While it is a stark reminder of the financial inequity the U.S PERIOD Womens National Team has had to deal with they will receive a healthy share of winnings from this run the men made PERIOD Its ridiculous that backtoback World Cup wins did not give them those winnings they more than earned themselves but funds are funds PERIOD They are preparing a new generation themselves led by Rose Lavelle and Trinity Rodman and deserve the support they need to get back up to their skyhigh standards PERIOD

The mens team is just not there yet PERIOD The final game against a World Cup powerhouse made that clear PERIOD Were on the precipice of a continental shift though PERIOD This promising young team will only reload in four years arriving more experienced as individuals and together PERIOD This tournament we announced our return and with the games coming to our shores in  we will announce to the world that America took over yet another sport PERIOD
