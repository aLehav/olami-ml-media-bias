Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

March  

I was astonished by Dan Morans column of Feb PERIOD  PERIOD I was in shock that such a childish article would be printed in a college newspaper PERIOD Its as though Mr PERIOD Moran just pulled Julie Steges hair on the playground and is now yelling NAH NAH You cant get me

I applaud Ms PERIOD Stege for having the courage to stand up and crusade for what she believes in PERIOD I am also quite dismayed that Mr PERIOD Morans article implied that sexism is fine when its in cartoon form PERIOD Mr PERIOD Moran seems to be the one who should grow the heck up. sexism should not be allowed nor tolerated in any form PERIOD

I dont think you really understand the implications sexism has had for women Mr PERIOD Moran PERIOD Women must struggle daily to overcome the attitude that they should all be barefoot and pregnantand 1950s conservatist thinking isnt helping any PERIOD The attitude that some of us would just rather kick our shoes off and set a spell while the world goes by is ludicrous PERIOD

Wake up Mr PERIOD Moran PERIOD If you would simply admit that sexism is a terrible problem that it still exists and maybe suggest some ways to stop itthen maybe you would have a column that meant more than a school yard tiff PERIOD
