The candidates are disappointing but not as disappointing as their supporters who cheer uninsured deaths boo gay soldiers and defend racist comments PERIOD The candidates arent just far from perfect their values and policies exacerbate the economic and cultural divide that exists today PERIOD

Newt Gingrich is an adulterous fool with sensationalist sound bytes for a country that needs a more serious candidate PERIOD Starting a colony on the moon during your second term is a grandiose idea but its probably not enough to win over an electorate that speaks the language of the ghetto. yeah he actually said that about Spanish. not only have Newt Gingrichs remarks toward the Hispanic community been arrogantly ignorant but so have his suggestions that children work as janitorial staff or about Americans who cant marry respect the sanctity of marriage just like he has PERIOD

While Ron Paul may have some insightful albeit draconian suggestions for U.S PERIOD foreign policy his domestic stance is as woefully disconnected as Mitt Romneys PERIOD Pauls blind support of states rights could have grave implications for womens right to choose and his history of fraternization with white supremacist groups is nothing short of troubling PERIOD He appears on the surface to lack hypocrisies but upon closer examination of his constitutional interpretations regarding the powers granted to states many of the social liberals that support him would be concerned PERIOD

Rick Santorum is consistently homophobic and backwardthinking PERIOD His disgraceful attacks on the LGBTQ community should be enough to show that this man lacks the compassion to be a community leader let alone president PERIOD Giving Rick Santorum the benefit of the doubt is akin to his suggestion that rape victims make the best of a bad situation and accept what God has given them. rick Santorum may mean well but his bigotry is unfitting of a president PERIOD

Mitt Romney may be a flipflopper but the most distressing thing about his proposed agenda is that it preserves the status quo  the exact policies that lead to our current economic predicament PERIOD It doesnt take a degree in economics to realize that a consumerdriven economy cannot survive with supplyside economics PERIOD Rising education costs foreclosures and layoffs are all that has trickled down since Reagans presidency PERIOD

We cannot afford to elect a candidate that is not concerned about the very poor when the median income in the United States has decreased . percent since  while the ninety-fifth percentiles income has increased by . percent PERIOD Income inequality is not just a demographic issue without disposable income in the lower income brackets demand implodes making income inequality detrimental to the societal health of the U.S PERIOD

Romneys economic future is one in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer PERIOD Inequality is an inherent part of our current socioeconomic reality but we are all supposed to share in the benefits and the sacrifices PERIOD Instead the entirety of the economic hardship of the last  years has been endured by the lower classes while the rich have enjoyed relatively vast wealth expansion PERIOD

Corrupt beltway legislators obstructed President Obamas efforts to reverse supplyside economics and increase demand PERIOD Instead Romneys congressional ideologues continue to support policies that funnel tax dollars into the coffers of the one percent PERIOD Not that Obamas efforts were all effective but many of his failures on the Hill and around the country can be attributed to poor cabinet and staff appointments PERIOD

There is one Republican candidate that doesnt keep me up at night PERIOD While I dont care much for the Republican narrative he doesnt scare me as much as the rest and a couple of his issues speak to me PERIOD Buddy Roemer the former governor of Louisiana is refusing to take donations larger than  and is using his campaign as a soap box for muchneeded campaign finance reform PERIOD

More and more electability depends on wealth and sensationalism PERIOD The Obama campaign is expected to spend over  billion this election season and that does not take into account his campaigns recent backpedal on 501c4 super PAC nonprofits PERIOD Buddy Roemer has made the rounds on TV spreading his message and has found some resonance on shows like the Colbert Report PERIOD

I know that whomever I vote for this election season they wont be supported by Wall Street PERIOD
