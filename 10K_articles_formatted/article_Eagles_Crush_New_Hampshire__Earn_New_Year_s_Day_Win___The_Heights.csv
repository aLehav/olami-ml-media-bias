3664,2022-01-01,"heading into a New Years Day matchup both Boston College womens basketball and New Hampshire looked to open  on a positive note PERIOD Winless since Nov PERIOD  New Hampshire entered the game looking to end its drought and the Eagles vied to remain undefeated in nonconference contests in Conte Forum this season PERIOD Ultimately those trends continued into the new year and after a close first quarter BC ran away with its first win of  PERIOD

Coming off a 30point loss to Louisville BC   Atlantic Coast rallied to take down the Wildcats   America East by a final score of  PERIOD

Both teams entered the game with only about  hours of notice of its scheduling as BC Athletics announced the contest on Friday PERIOD The Eagles learned about the game upon returning to Boston after their matchup against Louisville PERIOD BC and UNH were scheduled to meet on Dec PERIOD  but the game was canceled and ruled a no contest PERIOD

We only had a day but we had a good practice yesterday and honestly I think last year with the COVID year you have to be quick to just flip the switch Taylor Soule added PERIOD

The first quarter saw both teams suffering from turnover woes PERIOD BC also struggled with shooting but eight offensive rebounds kept the Eagles in the game PERIOD Despite UNH leading for a sizable portion of the first quarter the Eagles rode their advantage in secondchance points to a slim twopoint lead going into the second quarter PERIOD

I dont think our slow start to the game was much of a problem with our time to prepare Soule said PERIOD Its just something that we have to recognize and get better at as the season progresses. bC head coach Joanna BernabeiMcNamee made some adjustments to get out of what she described as a funk in the first quarter and it showed in the Eagles secondquarter play PERIOD The Eagles dominated UNH to the tune of a  romp in the second period PERIOD BC also forced  turnovers the majority of which came in the Eagles  run to begin the quarter PERIOD

On multiple occasions the Eagles scored on a fast break or layup and immediately forced a turnover on the ensuing inbounds pass including forcing a rare fivesecond violation PERIOD Wildcats head coach Kelsey Hogan called a timeout after a Jaelyn Batts steal led to yet another free layup for the Eagles PERIOD The timeout slowed the Eagles down and UNH finally got on the board with a pair of free throws from Adara Groman PERIOD

Both teams settled down in the third quarter as the Eagles began to coast with their big lead PERIOD BC stayed in control and played a clean game shooting  percent from the field and not committing a single turnover throughout the entire quarter allowing the lead to balloon to  points PERIOD

Once the lead reached this mark BernabeiMcNamee began to play mostly rotational players for the rest of the game PERIOD While the Eagles only shot  percent from the field in the fourth quarter the damage had already been done in the first three PERIOD

Ultimately the turnover battle told the story of the game PERIOD BCs defense forced  turnovers which prevented the Wildcats offense from getting in a rhythm and gave the Eagles easy buckets on offense PERIOD Soule capitalized on many of these opportunities which allowed her to score  points off 7of7 shooting from the field PERIOD

I was just shooting Soule said PERIOD It helps when  percent of your shots are layups. featured Image by Nicole Wei  Heights Staff
