Lamont Momo Jones will be a name the Bobcats soon wont forget PERIOD

But for the Bobcats they will remember it with a victory in Paradise PERIOD

The Quinnipiac mens basketball team was able to hang on and defeat Iona  in overtime on Friday evening in the opening round of the Paradise Jam in St PERIOD Thomas U.S PERIOD Virgin Islands PERIOD

Jones forced the game into overtime with his late heroics as he sped down the court and drained a 3pointer with . seconds remaining in regulation to tie the game at  PERIOD Jones shot capped what was an eight point lead the Gaels overcame during the final  of regulation PERIOD Jones finished the game with  points  of which came in the second half or the overtime period PERIOD

In overtime Quinnipiac  jumped out to an early lead as Zaid Hearst drained a 3pointer on the first possession followed by Shaq Shannon banking in a deep shot from behind the arc to give the Bobcats a  lead PERIOD Junior Ike Azotam then added four straight points to extend their lead to  with  remaining PERIOD That would be all the Bobcats would need as they hit 7of10 free throws in the final  to seal the six point victory PERIOD

The Bobcats will now move on to face the winner of the first game of the night which was No PERIOD  UConn who beat Wake Forest  to advance to the winners side of the bracket PERIOD That game will be played on Sunday Nov PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD

Iona  will play Wake Forest in the losers side of the bracket PERIOD That game will be played on Saturday Nov PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD

After a rough first half in which he turned the ball over seven times Azotam came to life down the stretch and finished the game with a doubledouble and seasonhigh  points as well as  rebounds which was also a seasonhigh PERIOD He also was 5for5 from the foul line PERIOD

Jamee Jackson provided a big game for Quinnipiac with a doubledouble of his own with  points and  rebounds both of which are also seasonhighs for Jackson PERIOD He hit 6of7 from the floor PERIOD

Hearst Dave Johnson and Ousmane Drame all finished in double figures as well scoring  and  respectively PERIOD

For Iona Sean Armand has  points before fouling out in overtime PERIOD Tre Bowman added  but shot just 3for11 from the field PERIOD

Quinnipiac who has been a poor free throw shooting team over the years hit 26of31 from the foul line as a team PERIOD The Gaels however were right there with them sinking 24of31 PERIOD

The Bobcats did hold Iona to just  percent from the floor however while shooting  percent themselves PERIOD

If Quinnipiac wants to keep up with UConn they will have to do a better job of handling the ball as they turned the ball over a seasonhigh  times tonight resulting in  Iona points PERIOD

Since Quinnipiac head coach Tom Moore took the reigns for the  season the Bobcats had hit the  point mark just three times before tonight PERIOD Tonights  points are the most points the Bobcats have scored under Moore and the most points overall since Nov PERIOD   when they put up  against Concordia under former head coach Joe DeSantis PERIOD
