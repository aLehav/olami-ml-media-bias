This Sunday Hanson comes to the State Theatre PERIOD

I know I know this is great news PERIOD Unfortunately Hanson fans who dont have tickets are out of luck PERIOD The shows been sold out for a while now PERIOD Sorry PERIOD

On a brighter note youll still have a chance to participate in the walk for charity Hanson will be holding that day PERIOD

The walk which is in conjunction with Hansons  will raise awareness for TOMS Shoes a charity that delivers shoes to needy children in Africa PERIOD For each walker who participates Hanson donates a dollar PERIOD

This is a great idea PERIOD Who better to convince people to get involved than famous people in bands Granted Hanson isnt the huge cultural icon it once was PERIOD But the show did sell out so someone still cares PERIOD

If youre not sold on the idea maybe thisll work the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers Band are coming to the Bryce Jordan Center on Monday to support Barack Obamas campaign PERIOD

Bruce Springsteen held a similar concert to raise awareness for Obamas campaign a few days ago in Philadelphia PERIOD MTVs Rock the Vote campaign came to State College with a concert featuring Locksley Hymns and the Bullet Parade PERIOD Bands get the word out in a way that no one else can PERIOD

Also like Obama or not the Grateful Dead are a pretty big deal PERIOD When a band supports a cause people listen PERIOD This is the first time since  these four original members have performed together and theyre doing it in State College PERIOD

On that note people whove complained that the Grateful Dead shouldnt get involved in Obamas campaign are kidding themselves PERIOD The Dead were a huge part of the counterculture movement during Vietnam PERIOD The remaining members are original hippies PERIOD

Its more natural for these guys to get involved in a political movement than almost anyone else PERIOD Has anyone asked Ted Nugent to hold a concert for McCain Id go to that too PERIOD

It remains to be seen how much bands actually help the causes they stand for but its certainly nice to see bands exercising their considerable influence for a good cause PERIOD
