WASHINGTON  And the leading Republican presidential candidate is  none of the above PERIOD

The latest Associated PressIpsos poll found that nearly a quarter of Republicans are unwilling to back toptier hopefuls Rudy Giuliani Fred Thompson John McCain or Mitt Romney and no one candidate has emerged as the clear frontrunner among Christian evangelicals PERIOD Such dissatisfaction underscores the volatility of the  GOP nomination fight PERIOD

In sharp contrast the Democratic race remains static with Hillary Rodham Clinton holding a sizable lead over Barack Obama PERIOD The New York senator who is white also outpaces her Illinois counterpart who is black among black and Hispanic Democrats according to a combined sample of two months of polls PERIOD

A half year before voting begins the survey shows the White House race is far more wide open on the Republican side than on the Democratic PERIOD The uneven enthusiasm about the fields also is reflected in fundraising in which Democrats outraised Republicans  million to  million from April through June continuing a trend from the years first three months PERIOD

Democrats are reasonably comfortable with the range of choices PERIOD The Democratic attitude is that three or four of these guys would be fine said David Redlawsk a University of Iowa political scientist PERIOD The Republicans dont have that particularly among the conservatives theres a real split PERIOD They just dont see candidates who reflect their interests and who they also view as viable. more Republicans have become apathetic about their top options over the past month PERIOD

A hefty  percent cant or wont say which candidate they would back a jump from the  percent who took a pass in June PERIOD

Giulianis popularity continued to decline steadily as he faced a spate of headline headaches came under increased scrutiny and saw the potential entry of Thompson in the mix his support is at  percent compared with  percent in June and  percent in March PERIOD

The former New York mayor is running virtually even with Thompson who has become a threat without even officially entering the race PERIOD The actor and former Tennessee senator has essentially stayed steady at  percent PERIOD McCain the Arizona senator who is revamping his nearly broke campaign clocked in a bit lower at  percent while Romney the former Massachusetts governor remained at  percent PERIOD

None of the top candidates has a clear lead among Christian evangelicals a critical part of the GOP base that has had considerable sway in past Republican primaries PERIOD Giuliani a thricemarried backer of abortion rights and gay rights had  percent support  roughly even with Thompson and McCain who have one divorce each in their pasts PERIOD Romney a Mormon who has been married for three decades was in the single digits PERIOD

Nine Republicans and one allbutdeclared hopeful Thompson make up the crowded GOP field PERIOD It shrunk in recent days when former Virginia Gov PERIOD Jim Gilmore an underfunded long shot dropped out PERIOD Such discontent with the toptier could lead Republicans to reconsider lesserknowns such as former Arkansas Gov PERIOD Mike Huckabee or Kansas Sen PERIOD Sam Brownback PERIOD

Among the legions of undecided Republicans is Barbara Skogman  a retired legal assistant from Cedar Rapids Iowa PERIOD She isnt at all excited about any of the prospects PERIOD At one point she favored McCain PERIOD At another she was open to Giuliani PERIOD Now shes leaning slightly toward Romney but says shes far from sold on him PERIOD

Im looking for a strong honest person PERIOD Do you know of any she joked PERIOD She had an easy time detailing why she was queasy about each of the most serious contenders PERIOD Isnt that sad Then she reached a conclusion I just dont know. andrew E PERIOD Smith a polling expert at the University of New Hampshire said the number of voters in flux is no surprise given that the primaries arent for another six months PERIOD People really dont decide who to vote for until the last couple months or days he said PERIOD

On the Democratic side  percent declined to back a candidate and of those who picked a candidate some may be willing to change their minds PERIOD

Barbara Hicks  an English tutor in Arlington Va. said her friends got her to lean toward former North Carolina Sen PERIOD John Edwards but she said Its not set in stone PERIOD  I dont favor him very very strongly. the only other sign that Democrats are at all agitated about their choices is the continued support for Al Gore the former vice president and  Democratic presidential nominee who says hes not running PERIOD His popularity has slid some to  percent PERIOD

Otherwise Clinton kept her strong advantage over Obama her backers accounted for  percent of Democrats to his  percent while support for Edwards remained essentially unchanged at  percent PERIOD

While neither Obama nor Edwards has threatened Clinton in national polls both are giving her a chase in other areas PERIOD Obama leads her in fundraising for the primary and Edwards is running stronger in Iowa PERIOD

Nationally the combined sample found Clinton has the edge among black Democrats with  percent of their support to Obamas  percent PERIOD Her advantage is even wider among Hispanics she has the support of  percent to Obamas  percent PERIOD New Mexico Gov PERIOD Bill Richardson whose mother was Mexican had the backing of just  percent of Hispanics and virtually no support among blacks PERIOD

The APIpsos poll was conducted by telephone July  with  adults including  Republicans and  Democrats PERIOD The margin of sampling error for the full sample is plus or minus  percentage points plus or minus . percentage points for Republicans and . percentage points for Democrats PERIOD For the combined June and July samples the margin of sampling error is plus or minus . percentage points for Republicans and plus or minus  percentage points for Democrats PERIOD
