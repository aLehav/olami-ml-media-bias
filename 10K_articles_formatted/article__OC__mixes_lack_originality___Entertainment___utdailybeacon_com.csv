If the laggard comainducing tunes of  arent enough to make you want to slit your wrists not much else will PERIOD

Those diehard  fans who have had Nov PERIOD  the date of the  second season premiere penciled in on their calendars as if it were a national holiday should not rush out to purchase the shows accompanying soundtrack as only disappointment will ensue PERIOD While individually the songs might be sufferable as a collective entity the CD lacks diversity as well as anything remotely upbeat PERIOD

If the title of the soundtracks second volume is a red flag for the absence of creativity its songs only back up this lame attempt at unoriginality PERIOD With tracks entitled   and  one would more than likely expect uplifting songs that alleviate depression as opposed to the prevalent monotonous tunes that have you reaching to change the track shortly after it begins PERIOD

However the CD should receive some credit for sticking with the shows thematic mood as it allows the listener to relate to the teen angst heartbreak and difficulties that complicate the lives of the prime time soap operas spoiled melodramatic 18goingon35yearold protagonists PERIOD

While the album drags along it may be worth checking out for those lovers of indie music as it showcases the talent of Interpol Johnathan Rice The Eels The Killers and Nada Surf among others PERIOD Just make sure you or anyone else in earshot at the time are not borderline suicidal when popping this disc into your CD player PERIOD

Grade C

If  fails to enthrall listeners  will frustrate listeners as much if not more than its predecessor PERIOD

With mostly nontraditional Christmas tunes dressed up by bands such as The Raveonettes and Jimmy Eat World this compilation sounds more like the Beach Boys on Valium than an attempt at instilling Christmas spirit PERIOD

The only hint that this is a holiday album is the repetition of the word  scattered throughout the songs as to inform listeners that they are in fact listening to Christmas tunes PERIOD

Music and Christmas enthusiasts alike would be wise to spend their money on more  items besides  possibly a hat rack or maybe even one of those bobbing Hawaiian hula dancers for their dashboards for example PERIOD
