4897,1970-01-01,"the College Football Playoff Selection Committees mandate is simple find the four best teams PERIOD

However while the goal is clear the task at hand is not as simple as it sounds when put into practice PERIOD The difficulty of the process will likely be evident this weekend in the committee room as the 13member committee ranks the top  teams in the country and determines the playoff and other bowl pairings and Oklahoma may be part of some of the biggest debate in the process PERIOD

The selection committee goes through a long process to rank the top  PERIOD Going from No PERIOD  to No PERIOD  the committee uses the same process PERIOD It starts with every member of the committee making a list of the top  teams in no particular order PERIOD From there a series of listing steps and ranking steps is used to order the teams PERIOD

In the first listing step the committee members each pick the six best teams and then in the ranking step they rank the top three teams PERIOD The teams not ranked will be held over to the next ranking step PERIOD No PERIOD  through No PERIOD  are ranked three at a time and No PERIOD  through No PERIOD  are ranked four at a time PERIOD

This year three of the four best teams have been obvious from the start with Alabama Clemson and Notre Dame all but solidifying their spot in the playoff PERIOD This leaves the fourth spot up for debate PERIOD

That means the second ranking step is when the most debate  at least for the playoff spots  will take place PERIOD

Oklahoma and Ohio State currently sitting at No PERIOD  and No PERIOD  respectively are at the center of the debate to get into the playoff PERIOD Both teams sit at  and if they both win on Saturday both will be conference champions PERIOD However if one or both teams lose their conference championship games then this whole debate is moot PERIOD

When two teams are close the committee has a series of criteria they are given to consider when comparing them championships won strength of schedule headtohead competition if applicable and comparative outcomes of common opponents PERIOD The criteria are put in no hierarchical order and the committee members choose for themselves what is more important PERIOD

Its up to each committee member to determine whats important to him or her Bill Hancock president of the CFP said PERIOD But the criteria remain the same  the criteria that the committee uses to determine among teams that are really equal. putting Oklahoma and Ohio State to those criteria they stack up pretty closely PERIOD The two did not play each other so that criteria can be thrown out and each has the opportunity to become its conferences champion PERIOD The ability for Oklahoma to play for a conference championship did not exist a few years ago PERIOD While the Big  had a regular season title a big part of the reason it brought back the championship game was to help its teams in College Football Playoff talks PERIOD

Hancock said hes always believed conference championships can be a risk or a reward PERIOD

Every conference knows that that if they have an undefeated team going into the championship game and lose and fall out of the playoff because of that thats obviously where the risk comes in Hancock said PERIOD On the other hand the reward and really the biggest reward is getting another game against a quality opponent and thats what the Big  was lacking before PERIOD So now that they have that Oklahoma and Texas will both have the opportunity to show what they can do against a really good team PERIOD

From the perspective I think the Big  is better off with the championship than without. as for the other criteria the Sooners and the Buckeyes differ in strength of schedule with Oklahoma ranking No PERIOD  and Ohio State ranking No PERIOD  according to ESPN PERIOD

Finally the two teams played one common opponent this season TCU PERIOD The games against the  Horned Frogs will likely be closely looked at by the committee PERIOD Ohio State took on TCU in Week  at ATT Stadium in Arlington Texas winning  PERIOD Oklahoma beat the Horned Frogs  in a true road test in Fort Worth in late October PERIOD

After having played both teams TCU coach Gary Patterson said he knows which team hed rather play again and which he wouldnt PERIOD

Last year I had to play them twice last year with Baker Mayfield Patterson said Saturday after TCUs win over Oklahoma State PERIOD I would not want to play them twice with Kyler Murray PERIOD Telling you right now PERIOD Its recess PERIOD And its full blast. he said Oklahoma should be in the playoff if it wins the Big  Championship PERIOD Patterson also disagrees with idea that being a complete team is a barrier to entry to the College Football Playoff PERIOD

This thing I hear about Well youve got to be a complete team. no you dont Patterson said PERIOD You just have to have one side of the ball thats better than anything anybody else can do PERIOD All these people out there who have all those opinions about that they need to go try to come defend them. while Patterson may think being a complete team doesnt matter it is still something the committee has the ability to look at PERIOD The committee can pull up many detailed statistics to compare the two teams looking on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball PERIOD

Though how complete a team is isnt part of criteria for evaluating close teams Hancock said each committee member has the ability to choose what he or she values PERIOD

Its in the eye of the beholder Hancock said PERIOD

The Sooners are by far the No PERIOD  offensive team in the country racking up  yards of total offense this season which is  yards more than the No PERIOD  ranked offense  Ohio State PERIOD Oklahoma also run  fewer plays than the Buckeyes putting the Sooner offense at an average of . yards per play  almost a full yard ahead of the next closest offense Alabama PERIOD

Defensively the Buckeyes have the upper hand ranking No PERIOD  in total defense and giving up an average of . yards per play PERIOD Oklahomas defense is No PERIOD  in the country and allows . yards per play PERIOD

The selection committee can look up endless statistics about the teams and information about the games theyve played all season but while the debate happens the committee wont be at its full  members PERIOD Oklahoma athletics director Joe Castiglione Ohio State athletics director Gene Smith and former Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer whose son Shane Beamer is Oklahomas assistant head coach for offense  will all have to recuse themselves during discussions about the two programs PERIOD

Hancock said this many recusals at once is not uncommon for the committee and he said as many as four members have had to recuse themselves at the same time PERIOD It doesnt impact the debate he said PERIOD

Theres no way to predict Hancock said PERIOD But I think theyll be out for a fair amount of time. as talks of the College Football Playoff rankings and Championship November have ramped up Oklahoma coach Lincoln Rileys message to his team about its playoff hopes has stayed the same win and youre in PERIOD Its how his team has explained its close wins in highscoring games PERIOD A win is a win PERIOD Selection committee chairman Rob Mullens made it clear with what he said after the latest rankings came out PERIOD

When you look at Oklahomas body of work its still impressive Mullens said on ESPN PERIOD I understand that the defensive deficiencies are there and we talk about that but they really have a historic offense PERIOD What Kyler Murray and that offense is able to do scores enough points to win games and at the end of the day its about results. success An email has been sent to  with a link to confirm list signup PERIOD
