A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



After the Associated Student Government vice president used the term illegal alien in a post that endorsed Kris Kobach for governor there was student outrage on social media PERIOD

Michaela Todd ASG vice president wrote in a public Facebook post that Kobach would put Kansans first not illegal aliens. while she has apologized we dont think its enough PERIOD

This is a serious offense PERIOD

It might not seem like a big deal to use the phrase illegal alien because not that long ago it was regularly used PERIOD

However there are a multitude of racial sexual homophobic and genderbased slurs that we dont want to print that were once acceptable. we were proud when Kansas decisively voted that this language was not okay when they elected Laura Kelly PERIOD The Kansas people have rejected the racism and intolerance of Kobach PERIOD

But this incident concerns us PERIOD

Its never acceptable to call a person illegal and its important that we separate this word as something that only applies to acts not people PERIOD

Since the beginning of time groups have been put into illegal categories and are demonized with labels PERIOD

Women were threatened and called witches if they didnt know their place PERIOD

Irish people were once considered dirty and less than. being a black person without an owner was once illegal. and even now black people are treated as second class citizens PERIOD

Homosexuality was once illegal in this country PERIOD It still isnt supported by a sect in this country

Muslim people are demonized and scapegoated because of their faith PERIOD

Transgender people are persecuted and murdered everyday for just being true to themselves PERIOD

Hispanics are called murderers and rapists by our president amongst cheering crowds PERIOD

Most of us belong to a group that was illegal at one point or another and using dehumanizing language is a tactic to create ingroups and outgroups and set up intolerance PERIOD

This is the first step on a notsolong road to places where diversity and tolerance is outright rejected PERIOD

Michaela its time you meet with Hispanic and other students of color on this campus and start to understand their point of view PERIOD

Its time to start representing the people on this campus PERIOD

All of the people PERIOD

Not just the legal ones PERIOD









They may not be  but they are here illegally PERIOD  Often as a result of their parents illegal entry to the U.S PERIOD  The VP has a right to express opinion and if that hurts someones feelings tough PERIOD  They come from crap countries illegally PERIOD  We are either a nation of laws or not citizens first PERIOD  You should only be allowed entry upon invitation PERIOD  The term  offends me PERIOD

I would argue that our current immigration laws are no less palatable than the historic laws mentioned in the editorial PERIOD  The Hart Celler Act of  was the nail in the coffin of our immigration system PERIOD  Most of who you call illegal immigrants would love to follow the proper channels and be here legally but the number allowed to do so is a drop in the bucket compared to those trying to enter PERIOD  The VP declared she supported Kansans and Americans PERIOD  I thought she was supposed to represent students  Last I checked there were a number of students on campus that are neither Kansans or Americans PERIOD
