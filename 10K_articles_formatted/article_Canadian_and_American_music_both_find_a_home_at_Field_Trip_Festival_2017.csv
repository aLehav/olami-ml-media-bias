One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom





Setting foot in the park grounds of Torontos Field Trip Music and Arts Festival I knew little to nothing about the performers listed on the twoday lineup PERIOD I had heard a few songs from a handful and recognized the names of a couple more but for the most part I was incredibly uninformed PERIOD

Needless to day Wikipedia got a plethora of queries from my phone throughout the weekend PERIOD Still I gained far more from inperson observation than I could ever find in a web page PERIOD Here are some of my observations and experiences PERIOD

.The longer I watched Thundercat the less I wanted to leave PERIOD

I would actually still be there if he was still playing PERIOD Halfway through the first chaotic funk jazz instrumental I really didnt think I was going to make it more than a song or two but I made a pact with myself to stay at least until the Feist set started PERIOD Lets just say I ended up being very late to the Feist set PERIOD Gradually my focus shifted toward the onstage interactions and with that I was smitten PERIOD Thundercat was joined by two incredible musicians  a pianist and a drummer PERIOD The three collided and clashed then complemented and harmonized PERIOD At various moments I wondered if they had planned anything that was being played at all PERIOD Thundercat reassured me there was some sense of order with spurious sections of starkly hilarious and brutally honest lyrics PERIOD Toward the middle of the set he momentarily opted for more traditionally catchy beats and melodies but the funk and jazz improvisational influences were ever present PERIOD I strongly stand by the statement that his was the best set of the weekend PERIOD

.NYCbased duo Overcoats reached into my feminist electropop soul PERIOD

Anyone who can pull off an oversized suit jacket wideleg palazzo pants and sunglasses that cover half their face is a hero in my book PERIOD The two 20somethings Wikipedia didnt know their exact ages played song after song of minimalist beat backed pop PERIOD They struck harmonies so stunning it was hard to imagine a world where these voices never met PERIOD Their lazy semicoordinated choreography presented them as a united force of two starkly unique people PERIOD I added their debut album Young to my Apple Music account immediately after they bid farewell PERIOD

.LP PERIOD as in Laura Pergolizzi not long play has a bigger vocal range than you do PERIOD

The highly accomplished songwriter Rihanna Cher Christina Aguilera made transitions from a raspy alto to Phantom of the Opera high notes seem natural PERIOD I caught myself with a slightly gaping mouth more than I care to admit PERIOD

.If you want to drink at festivals in Canada bring your passport PERIOD

Apparently USA drivers licenses dont cut it not bitter or anything PERIOD

.Phoenix knows how to put on a live show PERIOD

I kept somewhat rough shorthand notes throughout the entirety of the festival PERIOD The only note I have from this set is synth guy slay. the rest of the time I was busy dancing like hell PERIOD A more accurate observation would have been synth guys slay because there were a total of three synths on the stage all of which got significant use in pursuit of the bright indie pop rock sound Phoenix in known for PERIOD One of the perks of being a headliner at a festival is that you generally get to incorporate a more intricate set design PERIOD Phoenix made good use of this liberty PERIOD A forward tilted wall of mirrors stood as the backdrop and reflected a light animated stage PERIOD The mirrors functioned as an artistic tool but also as a jumbotron allowing the musicians to be visible above the stages surface PERIOD Phoenix found a delicate balance between playing the hits the deep cuts and the new material PERIOD They ramped up the visual effects on lesser known songs and tracks with longer instrumentals to keep the crowd engaged whereas for popular songs such as  and Lisztomania they relied solely on frontman Thomas Mars wildly dancing around the stage PERIOD I dont think it was possible to leave that set without a smile on your face PERIOD

.I am not worthy to exist in the world of Feist PERIOD

On the pie chart of all emotions how many of them are you feeling The crowd accurately replied all of them. running to her stage from the Thundercat set I didnt have the best crowd position but she had the whole field feeling PERIOD Her actual performance was relatively understated she let her exceptional songwriting and ethereal voice do all the work PERIOD

.I saw Portugal PERIOD The Man live almost exactly a year ago and all the songs still sound the same to me PERIOD

Thats all Im going to say on that PERIOD

 PERIOD Canadian musicians held their own against stiff American competition PERIOD

Feist is the prime example PERIOD The Nova Scotian native played a lateintheday set on both nights of the festivalone with her band Broken Social Scene and the other as a solo artist  each of which had the crowd metaphorically on their knees PERIOD Her Sunday solo performance prompted Phoenixs Mars to question why his band was given the headlining time slot over her PERIOD Additionally Vancouverbased singersongwriter Hannah Georgas and Ottawan DJtrio A Tribe Called Red both put forth captivating sets PERIOD The second which combined indigenous dance with electronic hiphop beats made a very strong case for the innovation Canadian artists are contributing to the music industry PERIOD

Along with generally fantastic music Field Trip Festival provided a diverse food selection from a multitude of local food truck vendors a marketplace for emerging designers and a wellcurated exhibition of music photography from mainly Canadian venues PERIOD Perhaps most enjoyable of all was the relaxed atmosphere and a wonderfully friendly audience PERIOD Field Trip Festival  gave me something I dont need right now another reason to move to Canada PERIOD
