Do not go see Contagion PERIOD Yes it has an allstar cast that delivers an illegaldownloadworthy soundtrack an excellent script fluid editing and seemingly accurate science to back up the plot PERIOD However it also has the capacity to turn you into the next Howard Hughes hiding in a sterile hotel room covered in plastic and peeing into a jar for fear of contracting a deadly virus PERIOD

In all seriousness this movie is genuinely terrifying PERIOD It is perfectly clear that the creators of this film went to great lengths to make it at least appear scientifically and socially accurate and it pays off.Contagionfollows five characters each of whom is deeply impacted by an extremely transmittable extremely fatal disease that is quickly spreading across the globe PERIOD Minnesota father Mitch Emhoff Matt Damon watches his life slowly crumble as his loved ones are torn from him PERIOD Epidemiologist Leonora Marion Cotillard struggles to find the root of the disease in China while remaining unbiased PERIOD Dr PERIOD Ellis Cheever Laurence Fishburne attempts to calm a rapidly panicking public while racing to develop a cure PERIOD Jude Law slimes out as semiMessianic blogger Alan Krumwielde who stands to make a profit as the world burns PERIOD On the front lines is Dr PERIOD Erin Mears Kate Winslet who is trying to isolate all of those infected before the disease gets out of hand PERIOD SPOILER ALERT It does PERIOD

Those of you who are impressed by the cast list thus far have no idea whats in store PERIOD Prepare to geek out for cameos from Breaking Bads Bryan Cranston comedian Demetri Martin and a scenestealing Gwyneth Paltrow all of whom move decidedly out of their comfort zones in this film PERIOD The acting is predictably good throughout but Damon gets extra kudos for not overdramatizing what could have become a horrendously melodramatic role PERIOD One scene in particular stands out in which Mitch is informed about the condition of a sick loved one  it shows just how far Damon has come from his breakout role inGood Will Hunting PERIOD

Cliff Martinezs soundtrack is so distinct it almost acts as a character churning out a wail of steadily intensifying electronica that sounds like Trent Reznor and Daft Punks Oscarhungry lovechild PERIOD

The truly admirable quality of this movie is its ability to find horror in the mundane PERIOD The audience is assaulted with facts about how easy it is to contract this or that how often some people touch their faces after touching feces etc PERIOD If you dont wash your hands the second you walk out of the theater this movie hasnt done its job PERIOD The bigmoney shots in this horror flick arent of zombies chasing down a screaming child but rather of a sweaty man coughing up phlegm in a crowded marketplace and bodies in garbage bags being tossed into mass graves PERIOD

All right fine PERIOD See the movie PERIOD See if I care PERIOD You will have frontrow seats to two hours of seizures weeping loved ones mass graves and a surprisingly ugly Jude Law PERIOD But when I find you huddled in your dorm room inhaling hand sanitizer and weeping because of your own humbling mortality I will look down at you with the pitiless eyes of one who warned you not to fly so close to the sun PERIOD
