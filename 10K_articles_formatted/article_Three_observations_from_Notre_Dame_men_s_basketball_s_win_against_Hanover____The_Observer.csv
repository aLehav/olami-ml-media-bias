Jake Miller  Friday November  

On Wednesday night the Shrewsberry era officially kicked off as Notre Dame mens basketball hosted Hanover College DIII in an exhibition match PERIOD Notre Dame head coach Micah Shrewsberry inherits a very young team PERIOD The few upperclassmen that return have not played meaningful minutes in past years PERIOD For fans the hopes plans and assumptions for this season are up in the air PERIOD Nevertheless Shrewsberry made three things clear on Wednesday night

To start unfortunate for Zonaadvocates Micah Shrewsberry made it very clear that the majority of minutes will go to young players primarily freshman guards Markus Burton Braeden Shrewberry and Logan Imes PERIOD Forward Matt Zona and junior guard J.R PERIOD Konieczny saw the floor as well but the team seems ready to rely on them for supporting roles PERIOD

Notre Dame mostly played a loose man defense letting Hanover shoot the ball from deep PERIOD This worked against Hanover a team that shot  from the threepoint line in the first half PERIOD However this wont work against some of the Irishs tougher opponents such as Duke and Miami PERIOD The Irish have some promise in the backcourt and so Shrewsberrys focus reasonably is to put all of the teams defensive resources into defending the paint PERIOD Consequently teams can shoot from deep without being guarded closely PERIOD Every half second that a collegelevel player has to set up for a three increases their chance of making the shot PERIOD From what we saw against Hanover the Irish seem willing to take that risk PERIOD The strategy wont work if a team  or even a particular player  is on fire from deep PERIOD

Markus Burton and Braeden Shrewsberry are fun players and for fans like myself it will be entertaining to see their development PERIOD Like most young players Burton and Shrewsberry are volatile and will make mistakes PERIOD Some coaches lean into this volatility rolling with a highpowered fast offense PERIOD However Micah Shrewsberry made it clear that his team will not PERIOD

In his postgame press conference Shrewsberry stated

I want to play with great pace PERIOD That doesnt mean were playing at a breakneck speed. unlike the Notre Dame womens team the Irish will not look to the press or fast break as a primary source for points PERIOD Instead look for the team to utilize a lot of motion in their offense specifically cuts and offball screens PERIOD Turnovers will kill this team so Shrewsberrys system plans to avoid them at all costs PERIOD

Notre Dame starts the regular season Monday night at home against Niagara PERIOD Coverage begins at  p.m PERIOD EST on ACCNX and ESPN PERIOD

For those attending the game the first  fans will receive a Welcome to the Shrews Crew Rally Towel PERIOD Additionally earlyarriving students can claim their  fan shirt compliments of the Leprechaun Legion the student fanbase organization PERIOD
