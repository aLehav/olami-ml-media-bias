8813,2023-11-05,"throughout your collegiate career you will learn to navigate the city PERIOD But for any first timers acquainting themselves with the Souths concrete jungle heres a rundown on how to maneuver through the streets with the help of several common freshman quotes.Which quote do you fall under

Believe it or not the silent majority feel this way PERIOD Here are my suggestions to you PERIOD

 PERIOD Buy a Segway PERIOD Cant afford one Thats fine just rent one until you can PERIOD
 PERIOD Hire a chauffer PERIOD Parking is too much of a hassle and never convenient PERIOD Just pay someone else to worry about it PERIOD
 PERIOD Siri knows best PERIOD UmmYou cant be serious PERIOD Ask a stranger for directions PERIOD

Know that Atlanta is a city of douchebags PERIOD And I mean that with the utmost respect PERIOD Act like one and youll fit right in PERIOD

That doesnt necessarily make you a bad person PERIOD Granted you will meet plenty of cool ATLiens hipsters that went all organic and are spiritually enlightened plus a plethora of volunteers to charitable organizations PERIOD But they too have an inner douchebag PERIOD

Great youll know who not to ask for directions PERIOD

Students that fit in this category make the city their playground PERIOD My suggestion grab a bike because the sidewalk will only slow you down PERIOD

Explore every block in every direction for as long as the skyscrapers are in view PERIOD Stay open to where ever that journey lands you PERIOD

While on your ride dont judge a book by its coverthe epitome of Atlanta PERIOD Hidden behind corroded walls unique establishments pride themselves for the company they keep PERIOD Outsiders here on vacation satisfy themselves with tourist attractionspassing by fine dinners fancy music studios art galleries and exclusive boutiques even some locals never knew existed PERIOD

Embrace the city PERIOD Definitely worth the effort if you wish to diversify the scenery of your Instagram photos PERIOD

Youre probably a Facebook stalker PERIOD Know that being totally invisible isnt possible PERIOD You will be noticed by the many peoplewatchers PERIOD But there are ways to be inconspicuous and covert

First avoid making awkward eye contact and dont give off the death stare everywhere you go either PERIOD Its natural to get agitated but you dont want to look it PERIOD Try to appear relaxed PERIOD

When the campus is overcrowded with students on Tuesdays and Thursdayswhich it will be between twelve and twoyou can always walk underneath the courtyard PERIOD Dont be a killjoy and complain about how inconvenient the tradition is to you PERIOD

Yup PERIOD A trolley is definitely in the works PERIOD

Well see how that goes PERIOD After a few rides Im sure youll start to think its over rated PERIOD

Gosh youre so rational and think logically PERIOD People who fit this category excel in math courses or usually fit the role of designated driver PERIOD

Make use of the Panther Express PERIOD Youll quietly remain seated while nonchalantly scrolling through your Twitter feed PERIOD Occasionally one of Atlantas douchebags will hop on blaring music through their Beats headphones loud enough for the entire bus to hear PERIOD If the song selection is not of your preference tap them on the shoulder and make a song request PERIOD

And when crossing the street flagrantly yell at drivers for approaching the cross walk too close PERIOD Remember youre the pedestrian and you have the right of way PERIOD Let that douchebaggery from the traveling jukebox you met earlier rub off onto you PERIOD Heck play horse shoes in the middle of the street or a game of sand bag PERIOD

Yea so PERIOD What are you worried for guilty conscious

Look no one has planned out a heist to take control of your financial assets PERIOD Unless youre showboating a gold plated Macbook and youre not Trinidad James youll be okay PERIOD

More than likely you will have to waltz through Woodruff Park or nearby to get to class PERIOD Everyday a congregation of homeless people will hang out in the area PERIOD Do not be afraid PERIOD They can smell fear and will cunningly swindle you out of your money simply through their words PERIOD

Broad Street is an excellent choice for lunch but I highly recommend that you do not waltz around with your iPad late at night playing Candy Crush PERIOD Asking friends for lives when it is dark out isnt the smartest decision of you to make PERIOD

If you do ignore my warning at least request they loan you a charger so your battery wont die in case youre wrestled into a car PERIOD Youre going to need something to help pass the time while being held ransom PERIOD I kid I kid PERIOD

Get a horse and buggy PERIOD No seriously PERIOD

Youll see carriages pulled by steeds trotting along with a waste bag strapped around their rear collecting fecal matter PERIOD Try not catching a whiff with your mouth open PERIOD

Find a date PERIOD Its so romantic minus the horse crap you have to put up with PERIOD

This is the best safari a concrete jungle has to offer from the driver steering the horse to the well lit streets like Peachtree PERIOD Pick one theres a gazillion Peachtree streets PERIOD Hell compliment the both of you on your outfits and say youre such a lovely couple PERIOD Make recommendations on places to take your date next and youll feel so much more connected with the city PERIOD

Just be prepared to tip him at the end or risk being subjected to a couple of unwarranted remarks because hes a charming douchebag too
