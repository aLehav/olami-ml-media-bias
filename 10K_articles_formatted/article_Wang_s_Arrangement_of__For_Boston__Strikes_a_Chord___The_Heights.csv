3667,2021-03-28,"for nearly two years Nova Wang wanted to arrange a piece of music combining his love of the violin with his love for Boston College PERIOD He envisioned this piece as a sort of thank you letter to the University he said and aimed to finish it by graduation PERIOD

But when the pandemic hit partway through his junior year he was left feeling disconnected from BC and decided to fast track this dream PERIOD

On April  of last year Wang CSOM  posted his eightpart violin cover of For Boston on social media PERIOD The BC alumni Instagram page soon reached out to Wang asking for permission to post his video which struck a chord with the greater BC community PERIOD

At the time I was like Oh itll probably hit like a couple of the more recent alumni pages like it wont be a big deal Wang said PERIOD And then I think within days it was just like I saw it everywhere on BCs pages like the main Boston College page and it was such a cool feeling to see that something that I had done as a fun project for myself to kind of help like me and my friends during the pandemic really being expanded to the full BC community. the violin has always played a large role in Wangs life he said PERIOD His father enjoys classical music so Wang has been familiar with the genre since a young age he said PERIOD His parents encouraged him to start playing the violin and the piano PERIOD

I grew up a pretty involved kid Wang said PERIOD My parents wanted me to be the kid that tried everything at least once PERIOD And those are the two instruments my father really likes. his older sister who graduated from BC in  also played the violin and influenced his decision to pick up the instrument PERIOD

In some houses I feel like they talk about like passing down sports equipment but we pass down violins in my house Wang said PERIOD

Although Wang eventually stopped playing the piano he continued to follow his passion for the violin PERIOD He played under Peter Miller who taught Wang from elementary school until he graduated high school PERIOD

Wang has an incredible ability to stay focused and the discipline to take something learn the basics and then really keep refining it which was a pretty rare attribute Miller said PERIOD

Wang continued to play the violin throughout high school but he struggled to keep pushing himself he said PERIOD He attributes his ability to do so to Miller who said that Wang was rapidly rising as one of the top violinists in Vermont and needed more of a challenge PERIOD

I kind of refocused my attention with him away from more foundational exercises when I could see that he wasnt putting as much effort and I tried as much as possible to prepare him for going out into the outer world and to be successful in situations that would be competitive Miller said PERIOD

At the end of high school Wang had to decide on whether to pursue a professional career playing the instrument PERIOD When looking at universities to attend he was at a crossroads and applied to both music conservatories and more traditional colleges he said PERIOD

That was definitely a pretty big moment in my life definitely a turning point where I shouldnt say violin took a backseat but I really had to choose like where my career was going to go Wang said PERIOD

Instead of attending a school more geared toward music Wang ultimately decided to attend BCs Carroll School of Management with a major in finance PERIOD Throughout his time at BC though he has still worked to continually incorporate music into his life he said PERIOD

Wang is pursuing a music minor and he is a member of the Boston College Symphony Orchestra BCSO and the University Chorale of Boston College PERIOD He serves on the BCSOs executive board and has been the concertmaster since his sophomore year PERIOD Last spring Wang was one of the winners of the BCSOs annual concerto competition PERIOD

Wang is extremely technically gifted on the violin John Finney conductor of BCSO and director of Chorale said PERIOD He is both a great leader and a great team player and thats a rare combination  Hes one of these people that I know when he makes a suggestion its worth listening to. wang has also continued to incorporate his passion for music into his life by composing his own pieces such as an arrangement of For Boston. wang said that his love for BC inspired him to begin writing the piece at the beginning of last year PERIOD He wanted to think outside of the box and promote BC in some way especially if it combined his love of BC and his love of music he said PERIOD Originally he did not envision completing the project until his graduation PERIOD

The pandemicand a subsequent lengthy separation from campussped up Wangs plans by over a year PERIOD

As the pandemic happened I started feeling really disconnected from BC as Im sure a lot of people did because it was a tough time  and I really wanted to be able to unite BC together Wang said PERIOD And I thought this would be a good opportunity  because music is this universal language that really brings people together. though he had composed music before Wang had never written an eightpart symphony meaning that he had to adapt to writing something more complex he said PERIOD On the technical side of the project Wang ran into a few issues when it came to writing the actual music for the piece he said PERIOD Another challenge he faced involved the actual sound of the violin PERIOD

Violins have one tone Wang said limiting how high or low the sound can be PERIOD To write his For Boston piece Wang had to utilize audio editing to produce different tones PERIOD To do this he wrote two of the eight parts for cello and bass PERIOD He then recorded the parts on the violin and used audio editing to change the octave the music was played in to create the sound he was looking for he said PERIOD

One of the parts that was most challenging for me was figuring out how to make the performance sound like it wasnt just me doing it Wang said PERIOD Obviously the video shows its just me but to really sound like this full orchestra or at least this full set of like eight to ten violins was definitely something that took me quite a while to do. finney understands firsthand the challenges that can come with the violin and praised Wangs ability to adapt and be creative PERIOD

The violin is one of the hardest instruments to play beautifully Finney said PERIOD Its not that hard to play and be okay on the violin but to be able to make the sounds that he makesI mean he is a true artist. while he wrote and produced the piece sporadically over the course of a few months it took Wang about one full day to record the For Boston video PERIOD Most of the recording process did not take too long Wang said but the most timeconsuming part of the process was the audio and video editing PERIOD

After all of his hard work the most rewarding part of completing his For Boston piece was the reaction to the videospecifically from alumni who he never thought would see his performance he said PERIOD

I never thought it would hit alumni from years and years ago and seeing peoples reactions really did help kind of connect me back to BC during a tough time during the pandemic and I think at least I hope it really helped connect other people as well Wang said PERIOD

Besides his For Boston performance other work from Wang has also been posted on social media PERIOD

Miller instilled in Wang the importance of making music that has a broader impact from a young age he said PERIOD Although Wangs original motivation to compose the piece was personal what ultimately felt most rewarding was fostering a sense of community during what was an extremely disconnected time for many he said PERIOD

One of Millers biggest pieces of advice for me growing up was always to make my music have an impact like never just play music just to play music. wang said PERIOD Creating this video started as something that I did basically for myself and for people around me but it had that impact for me PERIOD And in this case I was fortunate enough that I was able to share it with a lot of other people. photo Courtesyof Nova Wang
