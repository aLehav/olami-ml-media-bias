Melissa Farley founder of the organization Prostitution Research and Education told the Seattle Times on Tuesday that the overlap between homelessness and prostitution is  percent PERIOD If you were a sex worker you would battle sexually transmitted diseases substance abuse psychological trauma and homicide PERIOD An estimated  percent of males in the United States have reported paying for sex at least once in their lifetime PERIOD Despite the existing demand for your work you would live in isolation forced to lie to family friends and the rest of the world about how you support yourself PERIOD

No matter where you are in the world society would treat you at best like common trash or at worst like a criminal PERIOD

Prostitution is universally seen as a social ill  a remarkably appropriate term for something that gives nearly everyone a queasy gut reaction PERIOD But how much of this queasiness is selfinflicted

What we feel and what we think are often inconsistent with each other PERIOD Today we are slogging through a deeply ingrained cultural milieu inherited from Victorian prudishness PERIOD Some of the strongest insults we have in English are related to sexual permissiveness and promiscuity PERIOD Yet we find ourselves philosophically more accepting of casual sex sex done for the sake of pleasure without regard to emotional commitments PERIOD Sadly the brain adapts more quickly than the gut and so we find ourselves stuck in hypocrisy PERIOD

We highminded people who look down on prostitution with either pity or vilification do more damage than anyone else PERIOD There is no inherent reason that paying for sex must take place against a background of violence and poverty PERIOD In fact the physical and psychological abuse that many sex workers experience is a result more of societys puritanism than of the act of selling sex in itself PERIOD

In a  article in the Journal of Medical Ethics Ole Moen systematically knocks down the nine most common arguments against the ethics of prostitution PERIOD Each at its base maintained its unethical because it involves the commodification of something deeply personal and emotional. however most of the people reading this would agree that sex need not be something deeply personal and emotional for it to be ethically sound PERIOD If this is accepted then it follows that if Sally wants to exchange money for sex rather than pleasure for sex then shes not in the wrong for doing so PERIOD Shes only converting the currency from pleasure to money like going from euros to dollars PERIOD Collecting euros may be a bit of personal fun but she still needs dollars if she wants to pay the bills PERIOD

The problems faced by sex workers are the same as those faced by any group which society marginalizes and makes vulnerable PERIOD Its often the groups that we look at with revolt disgust and otherness that we exploit the most PERIOD

A politician will make a speech against prostitution then return to the Ritz for a quick blowjob PERIOD While the more progressive among us take the view that if prostitution will always be around we might as well regulate it and make it as safe as possible for everyone PERIOD

Both operate under the same assumption that prostitution is evil and undesirable PERIOD Both are steeped in a patriarchy that fears women taking control of their own bodies PERIOD

If it werent for the culturally sanctioned violence and stigma prostitution could represent a viable economic opportunity especially for the young and the resourcelacking such as students PERIOD In fact for someone who is especially good at sex taking a soulsucking minimum wage office job instead of becoming a sex worker might seem irrational PERIOD

If prostitution were legalized and regulated tomorrow as it has been in many countries the physical wellbeing of sex workers would be dramatically improved but the culture of shaming them would remain PERIOD Even Wall Street call girls making hundreds of thousands of dollars per year must keep their identities and their professions a secret PERIOD It may take time for our gut feelings to subside and catch up to our brains Until then however we will continue to punish and push sex workers into drugs mental illness and untimely death PERIOD
