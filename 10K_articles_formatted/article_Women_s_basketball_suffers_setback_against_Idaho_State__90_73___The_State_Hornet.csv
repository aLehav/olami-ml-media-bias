The Sacramento State Hornets lost another game at home falling to the Idaho State Bengals  PERIOD

The second consecutive loss by the Hornets makes their record   in the Big Sky Conference and the Bengals record   PERIOD

After being down by five at the half the Hornets rallied early in the second half by shooting three threepointers but Bengals center Natalie Doma  and guard Andrea Lightfoot  finished the game with a combined  points PERIOD

We know Doma was going to score a lot said center Atty Boyer who had  points and  rebounds for the game but our plan was to shut everyone else out and they ended up scoring as well so that didnt help us. shes one of the best players in our conference. when we get panicked and when were down and since we hit those three threes said Forwardguard Emily Christensen who had also recorded her first doubledouble of the season it probably made us think that we can shoot but we should have ran the plays. the Hornets did tie the game early in the first half but could not capitalize on the Bengals poor defense in the opening minutes of the game PERIOD

We couldnt get over the hump Christensen said PERIOD Christensen finished the game with  points and  rebounds PERIOD Its nice to help the team a little more she said PERIOD

The Hornets bench also outscored the Bengals bench by a ratio of  PERIOD

The next game is at  p.m PERIOD when the Hornets are hosting Northern Colorado Thursday Jan PERIOD  at the Hornets Nest PERIOD
