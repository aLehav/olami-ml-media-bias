Both major political parties seem to have plenty over which to argue PERIOD With nearly every complaint and each political issue the president is the first to come under fire for the faults of our political system  perhaps wrongly so. whatever the issue the president is expected to not only have an opinion but also to do something PERIOD President Obamas recent executive order on immigration is such a situation PERIOD This executive order has come under immense scrutiny  being defined as executive overreach PERIOD

Through the Americans splitting from the British crown the founding fathers established a system based on constitutional law that would prevent any one area of government to overstep another. the executive branch was created to enforce Congressional legislation with power to be vested in the president. because the colonists had endured extreme tyranny and developed a disdain for the British monarchy their design was meant to keep American presidents from writing laws PERIOD

In Nov PERIOD  Obamas immigration policy granted an estimated  million immigrants temporary amnesty under his  This also created a limit on the number of immigrants allowed into the U.S PERIOD  but would not necessarily enforce these numbers PERIOD It was one of the most controversial acts by a president without Congressional consent in American history PERIOD Proponents claim that this deferred action of deportation is very different from executive overreach PERIOD They also claim that the president is exercising executive power consistent with other presidents throughout history PERIOD

Perhaps President Obama wants to do good PERIOD Maybe he is motivated by a desire to protect an already marginalized people PERIOD However the issue is not how  the intentions are but rather the dangerous precedent set PERIOD This action opens the floodgates for even more growth of presidential power. president Obama undermined many of the founding fathers checks and balances by disregarding the will of the legislature PERIOD

Some of you like me might be sympathetic to Obamas ultimate goals PERIOD There is a great temptation to ignore the issue of overreach  maybe just this once I urge you to remember that although today power might be used for your cause tomorrow it could be used against you PERIOD The key is to restrict and to divide the great power of creating laws among many representatives PERIOD Sure its slower PERIOD It seems like no one is ever extraordinarily happy with Congress PERIOD But it truly is the only way to maintain a free society PERIOD

Some of you probably disagree PERIOD A president is elected bythe peopleafter all The problem is that the larger the voting sample size in this case the whole country voting for a president the less likely the elected is to accurately represent the views of each individual PERIOD With each democratic decision there is a large number of Americans who are not being heard. as the famous author and political philosopher Ayn Rand wrote The smallest minority on Earth is the individual. the more that power is kept at local levels representatives  rather than allencompassing leaders  the more truly each individual will be represented PERIOD

Tyranny doesnt happen overnight PERIOD It happens slowly with quiet eroding barriers to power PERIOD What seems extreme and controversial now becomes common practice four years from now PERIOD
