Senior forward Derek Reese of the Tennessee Volunteers during the game between the Army West Point Black Knights and the Tennessee Volunteers at ThompsonBoling Arena in Knoxville TN PERIOD

Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said before the season that his team would have to shoot threes to win games PERIOD

In the first half of Tuesdays matchup with Army those three werent falling PERIOD Instead the Vols took a different approach PERIOD

Despite having the smaller team Tennessee started to attack the middle recording  points in the paint in the first half as the Vols beat the Black Knights  in ThompsonBoiling Arena PERIOD

A lot of guys were just kind of shooting contested shots senior wing Armani Moore said PERIOD At the end of the shot clock we hadnt gotten into our offense yet and I think that kind of accounts for a lot of the threes that we took. tennessee  shot just 2of11 and missed its first seven from behind the three point line before the break with Kevin Punter and Robert Hubbs knocking down one apiece the latter coming at the first half buzzer PERIOD

With shots not falling behind the arc Punter and Hubbs started to attack the basket with both scoring  points in the first half PERIOD

The second half however was a different story PERIOD Devon Baulkman missed all four of his attempts in the first half but started the second half by hitting a three from the corner PERIOD

Hubbs and Shembari Phillips added a three each after the break and Moore was 3of3 from behind the three point line as the Vols shot 8of11 from deep in the second half PERIOD

In the second half we werent stagnant on offense Moore said PERIOD We were driving and kicking and then we would kick it out again PERIOD He might have an OK shot but then he would kick it out to somebody who had a better shot PERIOD I think that was the biggest part. spotlight After Tennessees win over Marshall Derek Reese told reporters that he made a deal with the coaching staff PERIOD If he got at least  rebounds in a game he got to ask his coaches for permission to take a three PERIOD

The senior grabbed  rebounds for the third time this season against the Black Knights  and he cashed in on that deal PERIOD

With a little over three minutes remaining on the clock and the game in hand for the Vols Reese fired up his first three of the season as the shot clock wound down finding nothing but the bottom of the net and drawing a wide smile from his coach on the bench PERIOD

Reese has been wanting to shoot it and coach Chris Ogden made a deal with him without asking me Barnes said PERIOD After the game where he got  Derek waited on me after the press conference and asked Do I get to shoot a three I said No. he asked me again tonight and I said Anytime with one second left on the shot clock PERIOD Thats when you can shoot it. reese finished the game just one point away from his first doubledouble of the season as he scored nine points to go along with  boards PERIOD

He has now finished with double digit rebounds in three of the last four games pulling down a careerhigh  in the Vols loss at Georgia Tech in the second game of the year PERIOD

I had to change my mindset Reese said PERIOD Before I just wanted to shoot the ball PERIOD Now I want to get double digit rebounds every game PERIOD Id rather have more rebounds than points PERIOD Thats my role PERIOD Thats my job PERIOD If Im not rebounding Im not doing my job. the other guys Tanner Plomb led Army in scoring with  points on 8of19 shooting including 4of10 from behind the three point line PERIOD He added seven rebounds in  minutes PERIOD

Kyle Wilson added  on 8of16 shooting with five threes of his own PERIOD Kevin Ferguson Armys 6foot10 center scored nine points and pulled down  rebounds in the loss PERIOD

Outside the box score Last season Tennessee didnt score  points in a single game one time with the high being  PERIOD This year Tennessee has scored at least  points in four of its five games with the  against Army being a season high PERIOD

By the numbers

 Army outrebounded Tennessee  making it the first time this season that Tennessee has lost the rebounding battle PERIOD

 The Vols blocked  shots during the game with four of those coming at the hands of Armani Moore and Derek Reese added two of his own PERIOD

 Tennessee had  assists on  made baskets compared to just seven turnovers PERIOD
