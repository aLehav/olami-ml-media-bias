7967,2021-03-13,"to most people the flipping of the calendar from October to November signals holiday season PERIOD For film buffs it signals the arrival of awardseeking films PERIOD In order to keep their freshness in Oscar voters minds and create a public buzz prestige pictures from studios will start to release around holiday season PERIOD Most years it is glorious PERIOD This year not so much PERIOD Awardlevel films that are carrying tons of film festival buzz have always come to town around this time each year but this year they just arent getting here PERIOD This is happening for a simple reason PERIOD Blockbuster studio films are hijacking the holiday season PERIOD

At this time last year I had seen Hell or High Water Moonlight Hacksaw Ridge and Arrival with Manchester by the Sea and other Best Picture nominees soon following PERIOD This year in the holiday season I have seen the third installment in Marvels Thor franchise the eighth installment in the Saw franchise and a remake of a film based on a book in the form of Murder on the Orient Express. that isnt even mentioning the soonarriving mega blockbuster Justice League from Warner Brothers and the newest Pixar film Coco. take a peek down the road to December and there is a Dreamworks animated adaptation of The Story of Ferdinand a Jumanji reboot starring The Rock a third Pitch Perfect film and the next episode of the behemoth Star Wars franchise

There isnt necessarily a problem with these megabudget films existing or coming out during what is typically Oscar season PERIOD In a perfect world studio blockbusters and highbrow Oscar fodder exist in perfect harmony PERIOD That being said business in the film industry is quite far from a perfect world PERIOD No problem is posed for those who live in or around major film cities like Los Angeles New York City or Atlanta as most every film will release there regardless of its business status PERIOD However for the rest of the country it is becoming less and less likely to see the lessfinanciallysupported Oscar films like they usually can PERIOD

This new trend of holiday season blockbusters can more or less be traced back to  with Disneys December release of Star Wars The Force Awakens. with the rapidly growing number of massive blockbusters releasing each year studios started to realize that they cant all share the Summer season and expect to make a return on their ninedigit investments so when Disney wanted to roll out what was perhaps the most hyped film in the past decade they released it at Christmas time PERIOD They knew that the return of Star Wars was a big enough occasion to compete with any awards contenders that were releasing so they took the chance to make themselves the exclusive blockbuster and they succeeded with the film making over  billion dollars worldwide PERIOD One year later in  Disney released Marvels Dr PERIOD Strange in November followed by Rogue One A Star Wars Story in December and both were financially profitable PERIOD After  and  the rest of the studio industry started to follow Disney as they often do so now we have our situation in  with smaller independent films too afraid to release wide and compete with blockbusters like Justice League and Star Wars. another way these studios are manipulating the films of the season is by jacking up the prices for theaters to screen their films PERIOD This issue has been causing the steady rise in movie ticket sales and it hasnt been slowing down PERIOD This doesnt only affect film goers wallets but also the theaters funds PERIOD When the theaters shell out so much money to screen a blockbuster that will attract several patrons they dont always have the money to turn around and pay to screen a smaller prestige film that might not get as many patrons into seats PERIOD Disney recently laid out new requirements of theaters in order to screen the upcoming Star Wars film that are squeezing theaters tighter than ever which has lead to many theaters refusing to screen what will almost certainly be the highest grossing film of  PERIOD

Along with the recent advent of the earlyyear blockbuster releases with the likes of Deadpool and Logan the new trend of holiday season blockbusters is starting to make every season blockbuster season PERIOD This isnt as much of a negative thing as much as it is an observation of something that is certainly happening in the American film industry PERIOD It is a trend which I feel cannot be kept up and will almost certainly lead to a major industry shift whether that be the fall of multiplex theaters the fall of a couple major studios or just a reframing of award shows at large PERIOD Either way I want to be able to catch some Oscar films before the end of the year without having to drive to an Atlanta theater to do so PERIOD",Column: Studio films hijack the holidays â€“ The Crimson White,University of Alabama
