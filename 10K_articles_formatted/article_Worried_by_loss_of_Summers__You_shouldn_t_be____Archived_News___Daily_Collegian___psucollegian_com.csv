Worried by loss of Summers You shouldnt be

My Opinion

If a forward transfers from a below average basketball program does anyone care

And if he really is an awful player should anyone care

The answers to those questions are no and no PERIOD

Yesterday sophomore forward Robert Summers announced his decision to leave the Penn State mens basketball program PERIOD Junior Jan Jagla also decided to leave to pursue a professional basketball career PERIOD That decision makes sense as Jagla has averaged double digits and has talent on the offensive end PERIOD But Summers decision is the one that baffles me but in no way will I nor should anyone lose sleep over it PERIOD

If he were even a mediocre player then it would be alright to be upset but the fact that the guy averaged . points and . rebounds in  minutes a game tells me that he wont be missed PERIOD While he was one of the Nittany Lions better interior defensive players he shot . percent from the field and a teamworst . percent from the freethrow line PERIOD While his percentage from the field is not much different from the teams overall percentage when a player is 6foot11 he cannot shoot that poorly PERIOD

Thats why I am miffed by the comments that Summers made to The PatriotNews about his decision to transfer PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

How in the world do you fully utilize a player this bad You dont you try to hide him PERIOD

Did Robert Summers really deserve more than two shots a game No the majority of shots should belong to Marlon Smith Jan Jagla and Aaron Johnson PERIOD Even when Johnson Luber or Smith would find Summers cutting to the hoop eight out of  times the ball would clank off his hands like Donovan McNabb passes to Todd Pinkston and James Thrash PERIOD If mens basketball coach Ed DeChellis had decided to run any offense through Summers he would have been laughed out of than you can say Jerry Dunn PERIOD

The Gahanna Ohio native is no doubt now the worst former starter in the Big Ten PERIOD However he told The PatriotNews that he doesnt want to step down far in competition PERIOD He hasnt yet decided on any specific schools  go figure PERIOD His phone probably hasnt been ringing off the hook but Penn StateBehrend is a possibility PERIOD

All joking aside DeChellis has got to be wondering why Summers would transfer PERIOD He was getting career high minutes in a  conference and he didnt exactly draw a lot of attention during the recruiting process PERIOD Im sure he isnt too concerned considering Jason McDougald could probably give the Lions just as much as Summers has which tells you exactly how much Summers has contributed PERIOD

DeChellis has now had five players depart during his reign including Sharif Chambliss Brandon Cameron DeForrest RileySmith and Jan Jagla PERIOD Summers exodus is right up there with Cameron on the  meter PERIOD The only thing his departure will hurt is the depth of the Lions as it leaves them with basically three returning serviceable players in Luber Smith and Johnson PERIOD

It looks like DeChellis will have his hands full playing shorthanded with an inexperienced team once again PERIOD Regardless the loss of Summers should be an addition by subtraction PERIOD

It is probable that this column will be the most written about Robert Summers in his collegiate basketball career PERIOD His leaving barely warranted a mention on gopsusports.com and it didnt receive any mention on espn.com or cbs.sportsline.com  PERIOD
