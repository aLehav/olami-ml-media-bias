5958,2023-07-11,"spring is an interesting time for college football programs all over the country PERIOD

Some elite teams struggle to maintain their status atop the college football world  except Alabama of course  while irrelevant teams scratch and claw in an attempt to overcome mediocrity once the lights are shining PERIOD

Then theres Texas a team that knows both sides of this coin all too well especially the latter side as of the last few years PERIOD But aside from Texas impressive  recruiting class some of the largest strides the program is making arent even on the field PERIOD

That doesnt mean onthefield questions wont surround the program when Texas kicks off the  season at Maryland on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Whos the quarterback And the running back Will Texas lose to Maryland and struggle to fill the stands throughout the entirety of the season Or will the Longhorns build off the momentum from the Texas Bowl and an intense offseason

These questions are fine but they wont find an answer anytime soon PERIOD Heres what we know

Herman Del Conte make strides in getting Texas back

Just  minutes before kickoff on Oct PERIOD  against No PERIOD  Oklahoma State Longhorn fans were looking at a sparsely filled student section PERIOD It stayed like that for nearly the entirety of the game and Texas head coach Tom Herman couldnt help but take notice PERIOD

I was disappointed that we had performed to the point where the students had that kind of apathy for losing Herman said the following week PERIOD Weve got to do a better job. heres the thing about the culture at Texas  it takes time to turn things around especially in Austin PERIOD Texas students have arrived to a point where they would rather explore the city than attend a Texas game PERIOD This didnt happen overnight either PERIOD Although Charlie Strongs campaign was a short one it still did enough damage to the atmosphere at Darrell K RoyalTexas Memorial Stadium on Saturday afternoons PERIOD

But this challenge isnt being met without effort across the board PERIOD Texas made a huge move in hiring former TCU Athletic Director Chris Del Conte PERIOD Herman and Del Conte have made several strides in the past six months PERIOD The new general admission seating for students the statewide This Is Texas Tour the nationally ranked recruiting class and even the festivities at Texas OrangeWhite spring game may be just what the Longhorns need to get the ball rolling PERIOD

The running game isnt doomed

Theres no hiding it The running game hasnt been Texas strong suit since DOnta Foreman hung up his burnt orange jersey for the final time in  PERIOD Last years struggles were in large part due to the nonstop injuries that destructed the offensive line and the limited use of Chris Warren III PERIOD

Despite the injuries though the running game was one of the larger question marks heading into the spring game on Saturday night which led to unfair criticism PERIOD Yes both quarterbacks were the leading rushers Saturday night but the offensive line was playing both ways and offensive coordinator Tim Beck was fairly limited in his play calling PERIOD

Thats really all a spring game is  some call it vanilla others just call it unentertaining PERIOD But thats what major spring games across the country have come to now that they are televised for everybody to see PERIOD The running game isnt dead PERIOD It was last year but treating the spring game like anything more than that is a mistake PERIOD

As for the culture thats something Herman Del Conte and Texas Athletics can continue the fight to return to prominence but we wont be able to measure their achievements until the fall PERIOD

Itd be silly to expect a sellout on Sept PERIOD  for the home opener against Tulsa but USC comes to Austin the following week PERIOD If the Trojans cant bring Hollywood to Austin its fair to say no one can PERIOD
