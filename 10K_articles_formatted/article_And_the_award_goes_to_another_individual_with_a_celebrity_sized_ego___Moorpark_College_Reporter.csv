Okay I understand awarding exemplary performance in something no matter what the field PERIOD One of the best ways of encouraging people to excel is the awards process but once again the plague upon mankind known as celebrities have managed to turn something as fun and harmless as awards into a complete and total abomination PERIOD

Every time I turn around theres another awards show on TV PERIOD There are the Oscars the Grammys the Emmys the Golden Globes the SAG Awards MTV Video Music Awards MTV Movie Awards the Country Music Awards and so on and so on PERIOD  My God when will it end

Ive always been aware of the fact the celebrities are the most selfabsorbed egotistical people in the world but this is just ridiculous PERIOD How many times do I have to listen to people say that Brokeback Mountain is the best movies of the year I have been listening to people say that since before Brokeback Mountain was even released And quite frankly how many times do the makers of these movies have to be TOLD that their film is the best movie of the year Arent their egos overinflated enough

Not to mention the Lifetime Achievement specials that are held where a huge auditorium of celebrities show up to stroke the ego of another celebrity PERIOD I can just imagine whats going through their minds All of these people are here and they all showed up because I am so wonderful

Personally I cannot imagine a group less deserving of accolade PERIOD Come on these people do NOTHING Not only do they do nothing they get paid disgusting sums of money to do nothing PERIOD Actors do not deserve to get so much recognition they dedicate their lives to playing make believe They are professional pretenders

Now I dont think we should flat out abandon the award show PERIOD Im just wondering why there have to be so many of them for the exact same thing PERIOD Why cant we just have the academy awards Oh wait I know why PERIOD Its because celebrities love being told how wonderful they are on a daily basis PERIOD How stupid of me PERIOD
