The Dahnke Ballroom in Duncan Student Center will be alive with sights sounds and smells from around the world Thursday PERIOD The annual Night Market sponsored by the Taiwanese Student Association TSA and the Liu Institute for Asia and Asian Studies will host booths offering a wide variety of cuisines as well as performances and an art exhibition PERIOD

TSA president and senior Christopher Moy described the event which runs from  to  p.m. as a a spoof of an actual Night Market in Taiwan so that tends to be a lot like a really chaotic street fair with a lot of different kinds of foods. tSA Night Market is really about exploring different cultures through different lenses so we try to provide different mediums for Notre Dame students to come and see that he said PERIOD

Moy said the Night Market began as a collaboration between TSA and the Japan Club but has grown rapidly over the years PERIOD This year  different cultural clubs at Notre Dame will operate market booths including the Asian American Association Brazil Club Japan Club and Hawaii Club PERIOD The McDonald Center for Student WellBeing also known as McWell will also be running a table PERIOD

McWell targets conversations that arent as present in our communities and I wanted to create a presence for them there Moy said PERIOD

The Night Market will also feature performances by Project Fresh Encore by Notre Dame Chorale and Mariachi ND PERIOD This year for the first time student art will be exhibited at the Night Market as well Moy said PERIOD

We got regular students to send in pictures of the times they visited the places where theyre from he said PERIOD Were also trying to offer the opportunity for minority students to showcase their artwork as well. admission to the Night Market will be free and open to students faculty and the general public PERIOD Attendees can purchase food and other items from the different booths with tickets PERIOD On the days leading up to the Night Market TSA handed out tickets two per person in Hesburgh Library PERIOD Tickets will also be available for purchase at the event  one for  six for  and  for  PERIOD

Moy said he believes the diverse cultural representation at the Night Market reflects the diverse and welcoming nature of Taiwan PERIOD

Im not fully Taiwanese but I can go there and sort of feel at home PERIOD  Its a place where people are welcome he said PERIOD Thats what TSA Night Market has become PERIOD I guess in some ways its skewed from just Taiwanese street eats and sort of become a place where cultures can come and feel welcome around each other and we can offer anybody at Notre Dame the opportunity to come to our table. share This Story
