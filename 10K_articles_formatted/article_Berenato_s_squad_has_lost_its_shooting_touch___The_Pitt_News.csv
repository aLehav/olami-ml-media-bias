Twenty days ago in this paper I wrote the game story for an  victory for the womens Twenty days ago in this paper I wrote the game story for an  victory for the womens basketball team over Georgetown PERIOD That win moved the team to   in the Big East and gave coach Agnus Berenato her three hundredth career win PERIOD

A couple of days later I also had the pleasure of interviewing Berenato and writing a feature for The Pitt News on her career to commemorate the milestone PERIOD

Maybe I need to apologize for starting a jinx because it hasnt been as sunny in the land of Pitt womens hoops over the last three weeks PERIOD The team has dropped five in a row falling to  overall and  in conference play PERIOD They are currently stuck in a shooting slump that harkens back to the days of John Starks in the NBA playoffs PERIOD

Of course any criticism should be put in perspective and it should be noted that the five straight losses came against teams with winning records and that only one  St PERIOD Johns this past Saturday  did not have votes in the national polls when they met the Panthers PERIOD

But while the quality of opposition was firstclass the rim isnt any higher at Boston College or any smaller at St PERIOD Johns  and if you dont believe me Ill get Gene Hackman to bring his tape measure to the court PERIOD

The raw numbers from the last five games are downright depressing  . percent from the floor  percent from 3point range . percent from the freethrow line PERIOD And the totally irrelevant stat department tells me that all totaled thats  shots missed in five games and . shots that draw nothing but glass iron or air per game PERIOD

The source of the trouble is even harder to detect PERIOD While Pitt has played tougher defenses the shot attempts have been there PERIOD A lot of them have been open shots PERIOD They just arent falling PERIOD

Marcedes Walker has been scoring with regularity with . points per game and shooting . percent for the year PERIOD The other interior players for the Panthers have struggled PERIOD

Jennifer Brown the Panthers other lowpost threat third in the Big East in offensive rebounding has only averaged . points per game over the last five PERIOD Her shots have been erratic at best often shooting too strong on layups under the duress brought on by opposing defenders PERIOD Her post moves remain effective at getting her looks at the goal but her finishing has been lacking PERIOD

After a game against Syracuse in January Berenato talked about the difference between open shots and good shots PERIOD

Deep shots theyre going to be there with eight seconds or less on the shot clock PERIOD We dont need to take those quickly she said PERIOD

Offensively she always wants to work the ball inside and then back to the outside PERIOD In some instances like in the Syracuse game the team has failed to do so PERIOD But sometimes as defenses continue to double and tripleteam Walker the ball gets back to the perimeter players and they still cant connect from long range PERIOD

No Panther is currently over  percent from 3point range for the season PERIOD Katie Histed the secondleading scorer on the team has consistently shot in the high 30s but players like Amy Kunich Vika Sholokhova and Jessica Allen are all shooting below  percent  driving an exasperated Berenato after the loss to Connecticut to say I guess next year we just recruit guards. the coaching staff has assembled tapes of every shot the players took in some games allowing them to look at which shots were rushed or were poorly taken and which ones were good shots. the team goes through shooting drills in practice and spends lots of time working on offensive sets yet the woes continue PERIOD

With their next two games at home against highscoring West Virginia and lowly Providence the schedule at least provides good opponents for Pitt to regain its collective shooting touch PERIOD

Defensively the Panthers have played very hard and usually well and it has kept them in most of their games this year PERIOD But without the ability to score the winning ways of November and December could remain distant memories PERIOD
