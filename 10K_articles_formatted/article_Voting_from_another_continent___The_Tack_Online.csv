Every four years one Tuesday in November is marked as an important day PERIOD A day to speak PERIOD A day to choose PERIOD A day that impacts the United States for another four years PERIOD I missed that day PERIOD

Yes I did vote just differently than many other American citizens PERIOD  My first presidential vote was sent to a Minnesotan city hall by snail mail in an absentee ballot PERIOD The reason for this voting method was that Im studying abroad which I recommend greatly to Buena Vista students or any undergraduates at the University of Ghana this semester PERIOD

After the papers were emailed to me by the City Hall I simply printed them out and filled in my information PERIOD I mailed my ballot from the University post office weeks before Election Day because thats how long it would take to reach my state and clearly the ballot needed to be counted no later than Nov PERIOD  PERIOD So I had finished my civic task but the true event had not occurred yet

Fastforward to Election Day West African acquaintances of mine asked about my projections and told me theirs PERIOD As I stay with Americans and other foreign students in the International Students Hostel there was a concentrated following of the elections PERIOD If the college students werent in class they were discussing the elections PERIOD

Attention increased a great deal in the late evening as American polling stations began to close PERIOD However due to the fivehour time difference Eastern Time and obligations I had the following morning I chose to wake up periodically through the night to update myself through the web PERIOD  Also my Ghanaian roommates radio recited the ongoings of the special BBC program America Speaks PERIOD There was no difficulty in me staying informed PERIOD

In fact the big surprise Tuesday night was that the nation was so enthralled by the polls PERIOD The nation of Ghana that is PERIOD  Speaking to locals Ive learned that Ghanaians have continually developed an interest in American politics after earning their own independence in  PERIOD Fifty years later the election of Barack Obama as the first black president furthered the attention PERIOD Seeing a distant kinsman in high office brings pride to African hearts PERIOD

Im proud of the voter turnout this year in my country and I would have liked to witness it myself PERIOD To really experience an American Election Day as a registered voter Im going to have to wait four more years PERIOD
