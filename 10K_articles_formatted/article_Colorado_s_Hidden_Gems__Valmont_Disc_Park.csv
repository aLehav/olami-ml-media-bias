Frisbee golfing or Frolfing is one of the most laidback userfriendly sports around PERIOD

The skill set required to participate in a round of Frisbee golf is minimal and hardly physically demanding PERIOD All you need is a Frisbee or disc and a solid course to go to PERIOD Butsome company is definitely preferable with a sport that has so littlegoing on PERIOD The lack of action Frisbee golfing entails allows for plenty of conversation making the whole experience feel less like a sport and more like a leisurely walk with a purpose PERIOD Boulder has an array of courses to chose from and Valmont Disc Park stands out among them PERIOD

Valmont Disc Park is in North Boulder right off US  onto Valmont Road PERIOD This lightly wooded area surrounded by an exceptional view of the Front Range makes for a wonderful setting to walk around chat and play a slowmoving round of Frisbee golf PERIOD Theres an abundance of prairie dogs inhabiting an underground system of tunnels throughout the course and theyre bound to make your day PERIOD

This course offers eighteen holes that allow anyone to participate while also testing the skills of those who are not so new to the sport PERIOD The real beauty of the Valmont courseis how spread out it is PERIOD

The first seven holes are on top of and around a cactus hill PERIOD These holes are all relatively close to one another and are good for getting warmed up PERIOD

Holes  through  require you go through a gate beyond what appear to be the boundaries of the course only to take you toa huge opensky prairie PERIOD The obstructions are scarce on these holes but the distance is vast PERIOD You get to test your driving skills and your Frisbeesearching skills PERIOD

Holes  through  occupy a ridge where the depth of the terrain can easily deceive your aim easily entrapping your disc in a ditch puddle or thick brush PERIOD

Holes  and  also require you to exit another gate lining the prairie where you are funneled into the outskirts of an athletic field with tended grass PERIOD Theyre less intense than the previous holes PERIOD

The Valmont course is a perfect place to go to enjoy the day relax with friends and  most importantly  partake in the great sport of Frolf PERIOD
