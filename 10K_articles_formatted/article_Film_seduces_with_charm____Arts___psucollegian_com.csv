Charming PERIOD Thats the best word to describe Four Weddings and a Funeral  PERIOD Touching smart funny  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD charming PERIOD The whole movie practically oozes humor and optimism PERIOD

The plot though silly and romantic evokes classic Hollywood  its a feelgood movie PERIOD Sure its a bit hokey but you accept that and leave the theater happy and optimistic about life PERIOD Instead of synthetically forcing your emotions the movie puts your own problems into perspective and lets you believe in love again PERIOD

The premise is a twist on the old  story PERIOD Charles played by rising star Hugh Grant is funny selfconscious and polite  the quintessential Brit PERIOD But although he is constantly attending weddings he just cant find true love for himself PERIOD He wants the perfect mate but cant commit to any one woman PERIOD

The real fun involves Charles and his circle of friends who provide him with comic intermissions throughout his troubles PERIOD Instead of the stereotypical movie ensemble his friends are an incredibly realized cast of characters PERIOD Their interactions with Charles are what make Four Weddings and a Funeral such a hilarious romp PERIOD

There is the snakelike Fiona and her rich uptight brother Tom PERIOD The exuberant Gareth and his cynical lover Matthew serve as appropriate counterpoints PERIOD In addition there is Charles deaf brother David and Scarlett Charles flatmate who despite her flirtatiousness cant find a good man PERIOD

Although Charles friends provide plenty of comedy the films romance is somewhat underdeveloped PERIOD At the first wedding Charles meets Carrie Andie MacDowell a striking American  therefore a slut according to Fiona PERIOD But although we know Carrie and Charles are meant for each other Charles does not see it and after a brief fling they part until the next wedding PERIOD

But Carrie never makes herself sexy romantic or personable enough to explain why Charles becomes so infatuated with her PERIOD Whenever he thinks he has lost her for good she shows up again and you dont really know why PERIOD But its only a mild distraction and you end up rooting for them anyway PERIOD

The romance though ostensibly the primary plot ultimately becomes less important than the comic interaction between Charles and his friends which receives the most screen time PERIOD

Each occasion is a hysterically orchestrated excuse for them to get together talk and gripe PERIOD Its almost like an extended episode of  in that the characters are only truly happy when theyre not dating anyone so they can complain about it PERIOD

Only at the funeral does the fun temporarily slow down PERIOD A jarring experience it serves as a wakeup call to Charles and his friends forcing them to change their lifestyles PERIOD But somehow Charles finds himself engaged to someone he doesnt really love PERIOD

I wont give away the ending although I should warn that its probably not what you expect PERIOD But dont worry  could a movie that is so charming really let you down
