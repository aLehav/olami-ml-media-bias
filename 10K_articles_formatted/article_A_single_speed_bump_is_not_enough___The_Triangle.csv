Just a few weeks ago thirty-second Street in between the Armory and the Firestone building opened back up PERIOD When it did not only was there a newly paved street there was a raised crosswalk and median smack in the center of it too PERIOD Before construction that stretch of road was always blocked by food trucks and a crosswalk never existed PERIOD The new crosswalk will unify the exist portion of Lancaster Walk with the yettobeconstructed portion in front of the Firestone building PERIOD This is a great step for safety on campus for pedestrians  but its not enough PERIOD



According to the Philadelphia Police Departments in statistics provided to the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia  pedestrians were killed throughout the city in traffic accidents in  PERIOD Some of the most significant factors in these deaths were speeding and distracted driving PERIOD Its no secret to Drexel students that an alarming number of drivers zip through campus either not paying attention speeding way too fast or toying with a dangerous combination of both PERIOD



Philadelphia has laid down plans to reduce traffic deaths to zero by the year  as outlined in Mayor Kennys Executive Order  PERIOD This order includes changing road designs to incorporate protected bike lanes improve road markings and signals and install pedestrian signals on lights PERIOD It also includes more radical concepts such as implementing protected intersections and curbless streets PERIOD



Drexels campus today is largely home to faded road markings unprotected bike lanes and no mechanisms to slow down unruly drivers PERIOD Not only is the campus split in half by a major throughway crossing it can all too often feel like a suicide mission PERIOD Powelton Village is even worse regarding road safety PERIOD Any students that lives in the neighborhood can say theyve seen at least one dangerous road situation there before PERIOD



Way back in October  we reported on Drexel student Jimmy Zhaos petition to install a speed bump at the intersection of thirty-third street and Lancaster Walk PERIOD Zhao came across this idea when he discovered the University of Pennsylvania has speed bumps around campus to deter speeding PERIOD Despite the initial traction it gained with  supporters at its closing and interest from the Undergraduate Student Government Association ultimately nothing happened PERIOD No other speeddetering mechanism has taken its place on that intersection PERIOD



Drexels public realm plan seems promising in terms of changing road designs implementing several features that would improve pedestrian safety PERIOD But theres no word on what the timeline of building them would be nor is there even a potential start date PERIOD



Will a student have to get killed in a traffic accident before the administration makes radical changes in its approach to handling drivers The unfortunate answer to that question is probably yes PERIOD Drexel must act now to ensure our campus streets are safe for students PERIOD",A single speed bump is not enough - The Triangle,Drexel University
