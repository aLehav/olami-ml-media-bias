In the Oct PERIOD   issue in the article titled Opposing Parties debate on Education Chris Cabral was misquoted and Chris Khawands name was spelled incorrectly PERIOD In the same article the Democratic Party was incorrectly attributed with the belief that all poorly performing public schools should be shut down. also in that article Chris Khawand was incorrectly identified as the President of Democracy For America PERIOD He is not associated with them at all PERIOD  The president of the Democracy For America Campus Corp chapter at FIU is Franco Caliz PERIOD

To clarify Khawands views in the article do not reflect those of the Democracy For America Organization or those affiliated PERIOD
