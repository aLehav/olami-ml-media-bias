The Bachelor franchise has been a staple of primetime American television for decades now and its hard to envision that changing anytime soon PERIOD The intention of the show is to provide a chance for a single bachelor to meet multiple women and have a shot at finding love PERIOD

These days it seems as though the purpose of the show has centered around the theme of going on television to make money not to fall in love PERIOD Despite these wrong reasons and untrue intentions the franchise has never been more popular than it is now with ratings steadily increasing year after year PERIOD

Its confusing to think more and more people are tuning in to watch a show thats devolved into an overthetop dramafilled soap opera that serves as a platform for young millennials to receive brand deals PERIOD But they do PERIOD

The reason isnt because the American public is unaware of this trend but because they simply dont care PERIOD The drama and entertainment the show provides are enough for most of the audience to overlook the actual lack of success of the couples PERIOD

For the first decade of the series there is a plausible argument that contestants were solely focused on finding love PERIOD The allure of the show laid in the fact it was an unconventional method of dating and viewers were intrigued to see if this show would work PERIOD



But twenty years of the same shtick can become repetitive and monotonous so its understandable for the series to evolve and change PERIOD The longevity of the show is commendable and its likely due to its willingness to adapt to the times PERIOD

Today with the pervasiveness of social media and creating an online presence the air of innocence and deeply rooted integrity in the shows structure at its infancy would not be enticing enough nor would it attract a wide audience PERIOD What worked in the past would not work now PERIOD

The Bachelor franchise has a stronghold on the influencer promotion industry and its not surprising for contestants to capitalize on their fifteen minutes of fame for their time on the show PERIOD Ironically The Bachelor monopolizes online forums on Monday nights when the show is airing and has created a longlasting legacy for itself despite the change in the purpose of the show PERIOD

The framework of The Bachelor has drastically changed to account for the opportunity to build a personal brand so while the meaning and purpose of the show are no longer truly about love and roses the plethora of dedicated fans will always have its back PERIOD

The Bachelor franchise will continue to be the epitome of reality dating television shows but it would be naive of us to think its the same lovecentric show it was a decade ago PERIOD People used to question which contestants were there for the right reasons but as the past few seasons have shown it is more than likely people have multiple reasons for going on the show PERIOD

People looking to find true and pure love on The Bachelor may have a hard time finding it in todays social universe since the influencer economy has overtaken any true and pure motivations of The Bachelor contestants PERIOD It is said love is all you need but not many would turn down the chance to have love and money PERIOD
