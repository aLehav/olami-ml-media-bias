A line of people waited to get into the market before opening and continued to stream in throughout the day PERIOD

It has been a mess of people today PERIOD There was a current of people this morning that you could hardly get through said Nick Tefft from the vendor Spice Merchants PERIOD

Today has exceeded our expectations a representative from Dorothy and Tonys Gourmet Specialties added PERIOD

It cost  million and took  months of construction to complete the LEEDcertified facility PERIOD The market is now home to a meat market a fish market bakeries fresh produce vendors restaurants and more PERIOD

The variety of vendors came as a surprise to Calvin Ali Carpenter PERIOD I thought it would be more like a farmers market she said PERIOD It is more like a lot of different stores put together. the market is in fact many stores from around West Michigan that have moved together PERIOD Dorothy and Tonys Gourmet specialties moved from their location on Plainfield for the foot traffic that the aggregated market brings in PERIOD We moved here for the venue and more exposure said their representative PERIOD

Exposure was something all the venues gained on Monday PERIOD Shelby Kibler founder of Field  Fire an artisan bakery moved from Ann Arbor to Grand Rapids for the market PERIOD So far the move has been profitable PERIOD The bakers were up early making  croissants in anticipation of the opening PERIOD We sold out of croissants at  this morning so Shelby went upstairs and made another batch and then sold out of those too said Julie Kibler who was working the cash register PERIOD

Spice Merchants is a midwest franchise that was previously located in East Grand Rapids PERIOD In an interview Nick Tefft said he hopes the momentum of the market will stay strong PERIOD I think the market will be successful as long as there is good marketing and word of mouth he said PERIOD

The vendors werent the only ones to make the trek downtown for the market patrons from all over West Michigan drove in for the opening PERIOD The goal is that people will transition their day to day shopping here said Tefft PERIOD He thought this would be easy when people see the fresh local and expert quality of the food PERIOD

In addition to vendors the facility will also host cooking classes kids camps and other programming throughout the year PERIOD The facility still has space for five more vendors and two restaurants which will likely be filled in the coming months PERIOD

The indoor market will be open all year round from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD Monday through Saturday and  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD Sunday PERIOD It is located at  Ionia Ave PERIOD SW near the intersection of Wealthy and U.S PERIOD  PERIOD
