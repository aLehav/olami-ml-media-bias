At a state Board of Regents meeting on Wednesday outgoing University of Iowa Undergraduate Student Government President Connor Wooff was among student reps from four regents institutions that told the regents of the unprecedented student experiences this year PERIOD

Wooff said in Iowa City those challenges ranged from the pandemic to the consistent call for racial justice throughout the Iowa City community PERIOD

Racial justice and public safety has probably been the largest issue on campus beginning this summer with the murder of George Floyd he said PERIOD As we saw across the country the Black Lives Matter movement engaged millions of Americans and thousands here in Iowa City PERIOD We saw engagement from our student body on a public issue more than we have in generation probably since the Vietnam War. following these protests Wooff said USG focused on creating tangible change towards diversity equity inclusion both including racial justice and public safety PERIOD

The impact these protests had on the Iowa City and UI community led to the development of the Reimaging Campus Safety Action Committee he said PERIOD The Reimagining Campus Safety Action Committee was formed in June and is charged with developing a different more holistic approach to campus emergencies PERIOD

Wooff complimented the committee and said members of the committee are doing an incredible job when reevaluating what campus needs when it comes to safety PERIOD

The UI was not alone in ensuring students were a part of discussions about social justice on campus PERIOD Morgan Fritz the former president of ISUs Student Government said the student government hosted social justice forums and diversity roundtables PERIOD

Diversity equity and inclusion was definitely at the forefront of students minds and wanting to know that they were being heard and listened to she said PERIOD We are doing what we can to ensure campus is inclusive for everybody. students are learning differently because the majority of instruction at the UI has been administered online Wooff said PERIOD More than  percent of undergraduate course hours have been taught online for the academic year PERIOD Alongside classes he said the majority of student engagement has moved online as well PERIOD Under current guidelines the UI imposes a limit of  people on the number of people that could gather indoors for events in universityowned spaces PERIOD

Learning in this pandemic has been different than any class or any group of college students in U.S PERIOD history he said PERIOD Our students have come this school year learning in a global pandemic PERIOD In doing so they experienced Zoom fatiguemany have had a challenge with communication with faculty as its a lot different. the changes of learning in a home environment has been stressful and challenging to students Wooff said and options like extended drop dates and pass fail options to students have helped PERIOD

Kalista Nipper a 10thgrade student at the Iowa School for the Deaf signed to the regents and told them she felt connected at the school and the pandemic impacted her severely PERIOD

All of the students having to be in their home locations away from the campus we felt very isolated Nipper said through an interpreter PERIOD ISD for me is my second home so it was horrible to experience that isolation. she told the regents when the students came back to school the distance still exists and students are missing connections PERIOD

UNI Student Body President Elle Boeding said UNI is focusing on mental health support as the campus moves forward through the end of the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD UNIs student government wants to focus on making sure resources are accessible to their students she said PERIOD

Its really important that we give students the support that they need to be healthy and successful she said PERIOD Now more than ever mental health is at the forefront of all of our conversations in higher education. fritz said it was integral to ISUs student government to ensure students returned to campus safely and accommodations were made for them PERIOD

We were able to voice the student perspective and students were represented in the area of how to return to campus and I think it was largely a success she said PERIOD We were able to be back on campus and students were really happy about that. iSU student government also focused on accessibility of buildings alongside focusing on ways to ensure students were supported during the COVID19 pandemic Fritz said PERIOD
