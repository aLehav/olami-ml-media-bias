6816,2023-07-26,"on Saturdays at Southside Community Center dozens of kids run through the door in their leotards say hello to their mentors and change their shoes as they prepare for a dance lesson through Ballet  Books PERIOD

Ballet  Books is a community organization that aims to combine literacy skills and dance to engage students outside of a traditional classroom PERIOD It aims to foster excitement for reading through dance classes and oneonone mentor work and to target diverse communities that ordinarily would not get this opportunity said Talia Bailes founder of Ballet  Books PERIOD

Before arriving at Cornell University for her freshman year in Fall  Bailes took a gap year in Ecuador and worked with a local dance group PERIOD A lifelong dancer Bailes was inspired by the impact dance could have and wanted to share that with others she said PERIOD

I feel like dancing provided me while I was growing up with a lot of confidence Bailes said PERIOD I learned a lot about discipline hard work determination and really gained a sense of self. over the summer after her gap year Bailes assisted with research at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center located in Cincinnati PERIOD She learned that when kids fall behind in reading before third grade they will likely stay behind she said PERIOD Bailes now a senior at Cornell knew she wanted to combine literacy and dance in a new unique way she said PERIOD

The program is set up in two sections Seeds and Sprouts. seeds are  to 5yearold children and Sprouts are  to 10yearolds PERIOD In the Seeds class kids spend an hour in a class taught by student dancers and many activities throughout the class help incorporate literacy like writing letters in the air with twirling ribbons PERIOD At the end of every class the group reads a book together PERIOD In the Sprouts program students spend  minutes in a dance lesson and then  minutes with their mentor doing activities like scavenger hunts reading and crafts Bailes said PERIOD

By combining dance with other activities like reading writing and word games children are more likely to remain interested said Olive Onyekwelu a Ballet  Books mentor PERIOD Onyekwelu a junior at Cornell has been a mentor in the program for two semesters PERIOD Each of the  children enrolled in the Sprouts program is paired with a mentor who works with them oneonone every class PERIOD

One day my mentee really just didnt feel like working on reading skills Onyekwelu said PERIOD So I chose a book about yoga PERIOD My mentee and I agreed that for each page she would read we could try out the yoga pose PERIOD You find a way to make it work. the program has  total college and high school students serving as mentors dance teachers and assistants and elected board members Bailes said PERIOD

Ballet  Books is free for all participants PERIOD Leotards shoes and snacks are all paid for by grants donors and Cornell support and instructors are all volunteers PERIOD Local organizations like Pandora Dance Troupe provide donations that help keep the program free to students PERIOD At most dance studios one could expect to pay between  and  a month for tuition PERIOD The program aims to serve kids that would not ordinarily be able to take dance lessons because of these expenses PERIOD The program would not be able to function if it were not for the volunteers Bailes said PERIOD



A central focus of Ballet  Books is connecting local college students with their community Bailes said PERIOD Most mentors come from Cornell with a few from Ithaca College and local high schools PERIOD

It can be really refreshing to come here and get away from my studies for a minute and immerse myself in the Ithaca community Onyekwelu said PERIOD

Parents of Ballet  Books students also value the partnerships between their children and their mentors PERIOD

I love that my daughter has a chance to glance into what her future could be like and that she has so many great role models around her said May Yaelin the mother of Supantra a Sprouts dancer PERIOD

Supantra started dancing a year ago as she was entering second grade PERIOD Yaelin said she received an email from Tompkins County advertising Ballet  Books and thought it could be a great thing for her daughter PERIOD Supantra had experienced developmental delays socially and Ballet  Books has helped Yaelin said PERIOD

The program focuses on so many good things for Supantra like her confidence healthy habits physical health and positive body image Yaelin said PERIOD

It is also important that the students enjoy what theyre doing Bailes said PERIOD

When I am dancing it feels like Im dreaming 8yearold Supantra said PERIOD

Bailes said she finds it so rewarding to see students grow and come out of their shells PERIOD One of her greatest memories with Ballet  Books occurred last spring when all of the kids were onstage at Cornell PERIOD One young student got on stage and danced and Bailes later received an email that said the students sister cried while watching because she was so proud of her PERIOD Emails like this are common Bailes said PERIOD

Ballet  Books is currently focusing on national expansion aiming to grow beyond the original Ithaca chapter PERIOD In addition to developing chapters in New Jersey and Florida the program aims to expand further Bailes said PERIOD

Ithaca College senior Kevin Swann is the current marketing coordinator for Ballet  Books PERIOD

This semester were really working on compiling and sharing the resources weve gathered with other communities so people in other areas can start their own Ballet  Books programs in their area Swann said PERIOD

The Ithaca chapter of Ballet  Books recruits new mentors every semester and can be contacted on their website PERIOD

When you get to college you always have this sense of needing to find your place Onyekwelu said PERIOD I stumbled upon this program by accident and found a family. your donation will support The Ithacans student journalists in their effort to keep the Ithaca College and wider Ithaca community informed PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
