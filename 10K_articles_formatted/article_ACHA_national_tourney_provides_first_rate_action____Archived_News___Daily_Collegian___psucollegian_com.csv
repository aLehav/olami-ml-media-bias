ACHA national tourney provides firstrate action

Josh Moyer is a sophomore majoring in journalism and a Collegian Icers writer PERIOD His email address is jjm454psu.edu PERIOD

My Opinion

BENSENVILLE Ill PERIOD

Some would call it a secondrate league a poor mans NCAA PERIOD

But for anyone who attended an ACHA game this past season that person probably reached a far different conclusion the ACHA may not have the same talent but its just as exciting PERIOD

I attended the ACHA National Championship Tournament near Chicago last weekend PERIOD And while Penn State came up short in the title game I still didnt go home disappointed PERIOD

I witnessed some of the best hockey games Ive ever seen PERIOD

No PERIOD 1seeded Rhode Island overcame No PERIOD  Weber State  in overtime and was then upset by Illinois in the final period of the next round PERIOD

Penn State also defeated Ohio in the last  seconds and virtually every game went down to the wire PERIOD

What more could you ask for

Well for some fans that answer was still the NCAA PERIOD One conversation I had with a local went something like this

Local excited Is this game really for the national championship

Me Yeah PERIOD But its the ACHA not the NCAA PERIOD

Local disappointed Oh .. PERIOD whats that

Dont make the same mistake  that may be club hockey but its no secondclass association PERIOD

NCAA Division I talent is allaround take Penn States Joe Maglaque and Michael McMullen for instance PERIOD Both played for Division I Fairfield until the team disbanded PERIOD Instead of going to a different NCAA school they both opted for Penn State of the ACHA PERIOD

The Icers Kevin Jaeger is another example PERIOD NCAA schools didnt take a gamble on him because they believed the 5foot8 forward was too small  130plus career goals later I think its safe to say they were wrong PERIOD

But just how good are these guys

For that answer go back to January when the ACHA represented Team USA at the World University Games PERIOD The ACHA competed against teams with NHL players and squads with Olympic athletes PERIOD Still it managed a respectable  record PERIOD

Not too bad  club players vs PERIOD NHL skaters PERIOD

Its hard to compare the ACHA to existing leagues PERIOD But think of it this way the ACHA simply recruits players who fall through the cracks in the NCAA PERIOD

For you football fans and quarterback aficionados out there think Kurt Warner with the Arena Football League or Tommy Maddox with the XFL or even Doug Flutie with the CFL PERIOD

What we have with the ACHA is a collection of Warners Maddoxes and Fluties  good players in a notsorecognized league PERIOD

Trust me I wouldnt have taken the trip to Chicago and stayed in a place surrounded by cop cars and  if I thought otherwise  and even if our  towels were matted with the previous guests body hair our luggage was lost our first flight was cancelled and our second flight was twice delayed PERIOD

Id still do it all over again PERIOD And even though I wont have the Icers beat next season Ill still make the trip to the national championship tournament PERIOD

Of course next year Ill just drive to a relatives house PERIOD
