Fridays demolition of the Wall of Oppression will mark the closing of Social Justice and Diversity week and a time to reflect on what we say and how it affects out peers PERIOD

Words that have personally offended and collectively hurt members of Easterns community have been painted in reds and greens challenging students on their way to class PERIOD

Some of the words on the wall are so specific and so personal one can only wonder what would encourage another person to say them out loud PERIOD

The reality of it is that every person has something within them that has the ability to conjure the most painfully discriminatory statements toward another person or group PERIOD

Whether that part of a person is encouraged by anger social pressures or a biased upbringing it is important to acknowledge that every person should be afforded basic human rights and the right to feel comfortable and safe particularly in a place where the live and study PERIOD

A college campus is the perfect place to not only experience but also celebrate diversity PERIOD

People from all corners of the world have come together to develop themselves at different stages of their lives PERIOD

Every persons experience unique however this diverse group of people have come together at the same time to develop their unique stories at the same place with one another PERIOD

In this sense every person on Easterns campus has the capacity to be empathetic toward one another PERIOD

Community members should be using the elements of their lives that bond them to explore the areas that set them apart PERIOD

The best way to combat hateful thinking is to educate PERIOD Free speech allows us to fight hate speech with language that encourages a curious compassionate and understanding society PERIOD

Social insensitivity is a large problem perpetuated by the single instances in which it is practiced PERIOD When the wall is demolished Friday do not let its message fall to the ground with it PERIOD
