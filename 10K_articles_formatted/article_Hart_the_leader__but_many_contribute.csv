Going into the season many prognosticators and fans thought that sophomore Mike Hart may have to give up some of his carries this season to fellow sophomore Max Martin and freshman Kevin Grady PERIOD But if Saturdays game against Northern Illinois is any indication Hart is definitely entrenched as the starter with many other running backs making contributions PERIOD

By the time the first quarter ended the back showed why it would not be easy for anyone to take his starting spot PERIOD

Heading into the second quarter Hart already had  yards rushing and  yards receiving while adding a touchdown PERIOD He ended the day with  yards on  carries with a touchdown and four receptions for  yards PERIOD

I think Hart is quicker stronger he knows more hes more mature and hes more powerful running backs coach Fred Jackson said PERIOD Hes probably the smartest kid Ive ever coached PERIOD Hell be a tremendous football player before the seasons done. harts most impressive play came at the end of the first quarter when he took a quick screen while led by a convoy of blockers PERIOD A Huskies linebacker weighing  pounds more began closing in on Hart quickly but the shifty back would not be denied on his way to the endzone PERIOD

I turned it up and then I guess I got lower than him and ran him over Hart said PERIOD

Even though Hart was able to continue where he left off from last season Grady saw his first game action and did not disappoint PERIOD The Grand Rapids native got the first touchdown of his career and finished with  yards on nine carries PERIOD

But not everything went smoothly for the firstyear runner PERIOD After Michigan had the game in check at  Grady took over as the first option at running back and fumbled the ball at the goal line PERIOD But the coaches did not lose confidence in the young back PERIOD

Thats probably the first time that ever happened coach Lloyd Carr said of Gradys fumble PERIOD I think you have to learn that as you get closer to the goal line normally there are a lot more people closer to the ball PERIOD Im sure hell learn from that and this was a good day to learn it. carr and Jackson put Grady right back in the game after the fumble while also giving playing time to Martin junior Jerome Jackson and senior Alijah Bradley PERIOD In total the Wolverines had five different players run the ball and the coaches were happy with what they saw from the stable of backs PERIOD

Obviously weve got some depth at that position and I think that is one of the real solid strengths of this team Carr said PERIOD In this league youre going to get some guys dinged up. welcome Back After missing most of last season and not attempting a pass former starting quarterback Matt Gutierrez made his return to the gridiron Saturday PERIOD He attempted just two throws but made the most of them going 1for2 with a nice rollingtohis left toss to senior Jason Avant PERIOD

I felt good being out there again because according to a lot of people I wasnt supposed to be doing that Gutierrez said PERIOD It had been a while since I had played a game in Michigan Stadium or anywhere else PERIOD And two years later it felt really good and it was fun. carr was just as happy to see the redshirt junior out on the field PERIOD Before last season he named Gutierrez the starter but a shoulder injury cut Gutierrezs season short PERIOD Chad Henne took over and has not looked back once but Carr thinks Gutierrez is a better person and player because of the experience PERIOD

It was extremely satisfying to play him Carr said PERIOD I know his teammates have great respect for him PERIOD Everybody in our program does PERIOD Our situation at quarterback is awfully good PERIOD I believe that. playing with the Big Boys Saturdays attendance of  was the largest crowd to watch a MAC team play PERIOD It was the ninth time Carr has coached against a MAC school and his record remains perfect PERIOD
