The Beaches a Canadian girl band performed this year in the Bulldog Bash lineup PERIOD The band is comprised of sistersJordan Miller lead vocals bass and Kylie Miller guitar Leandra Earl guitar keyboards and Eliza EnmanMcDaniel drums percussion PERIOD All the band members were decked out in bright red outfits each one unique from the others PERIOD

The one outfit that caught the most attention was lead singer Millers red sequined gown PERIOD If audience members eyes were not drawn to the flashing lights of the stage then Millers glittering figure did the trick PERIOD The most surprising part about the gown It was thrifted the morning of the performance at local consignment shop Revolution Consignment PERIOD

Miller said the dress was an unexpected yet perfect find for the bands performance PERIOD

It was this beautiful long sequined ball gown like something Miss Scarlett from the Clue board game would have worn Miller said PERIOD

According to Miller before she visited the shop all she packed was long sleeves and her stripper bra which she judged would not be fitting for the family affair PERIOD However the dress from Revolution Consignment turned out to be the most fitting outfit of all PERIOD

It was the cotton underneath the sequins that made it so comfortable PERIOD I could move around in it which is a really important factor when youre picking a stage outfit PERIOD I could breathe in it and it was mobile PERIOD It was a functional outfit on stage Miller said PERIOD

Miller noted secondhand shopping is her most preferred method and pointed out all the benefits of avoiding retail stores PERIOD

I like shopping at consignment stores for a number of reasons PERIOD One being that its better for the environment PERIOD Im not contributing to any waste because the clothes are already there PERIOD Two because the clothes are more interesting and theres more of a variety than clothes at stores that have a particular trend and honestly its more affordable too Miller said adding that her purchase was only a mere  PERIOD

Thats the magic of consignment stores PERIOD You dont always luck out like that but when you do its more special. miller gave praise to Revolution Consignment for their customer service making special emphasis that one worker even offered the clothes from her own closet. john Baker sales associate at Revolution Consignment was the person who sold the dress to The Beaches PERIOD

Baker said just moments before he had an idea to make a video for the store stating how their customer base extended from Niagara Falls to Mississippi. according to Baker only  minutes later the Canadian girl band members walked in the store PERIOD

They were great amazing people PERIOD I told the staff were going to go world wide back in January PERIOD And look at us now those girls are a big deal Baker said PERIOD

John said the purchase was made from their vintage collection which is a smaller collection found in a separate room in the store PERIOD He is now calling it the sale of the year. jessica Taylor manager of Revolution Consignment added that this is a unique part of their store and they were happy to see Miller find something in the section of the store PERIOD

We have a pretty small selection of vintage clothes but the selection we have is pretty cool Taylor said.We were so excited that they got her dress here and we were so happy to meet them PERIOD She just got really lucky when she found a bright metallic dress Taylor said PERIOD

According to Taylor Revolution Consignment claims the title of the only consignment clothing shop in Starkville and the store brings in over  new items each day PERIOD The store just recently moved from a strip mall area off of Highway  into a house on  East Wood Street and Taylor said this has increased their customer interaction immensely PERIOD

As for The Beaches they are also adding new things to their musical collection in the near future though Miller could not disclose when PERIOD Although the band was planning to go on an American tour the tour recently was cancelled because the headliner of the tour was in a car wreck PERIOD
