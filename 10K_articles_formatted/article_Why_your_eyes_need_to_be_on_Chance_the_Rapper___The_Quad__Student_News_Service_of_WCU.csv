Since Chances extremely lowkey Soundcloud releases Home Studio I Am Very Lonely Lady Friend Hiatus Broadcast and the absolutely brilliant cover of Wonderful Day from the popular childrens cartoon Arthur there has been a minor pause of solo releases from him PERIOD Just recently he dropped a cover of Kanye Wests Family Business which Chance appropriately retitled Family Matters in honor of his tour PERIOD Then Bennett finally dropped his newest track Angels featuring other Chicago native Saba and of course Donnie Trumpet  the Social Experiment commonly referred to as SoX PERIOD Chance fans were glued to their television sets this past Monday Nov PERIOD  to see him perform on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. to say the least he did not disappoint PERIOD With a newfound confidence he opens with I got my city doin front flips and for good reason PERIOD

Chance the Rapper arguably is one of the most influential hiphop artists to come out of Chicago since West PERIOD Through various Instagram and Twitter posts you can find him doing selfless deeds for his city constantly especially for the kids of Chicago PERIOD Consistently hosting open mic nights and taking various class groups to museums and exhibits it shows that he truly cares about his city PERIOD In Paranoia a hidden song off his sophomore mixtape Acid Rap Chance seems distraught about the terrors that come from summer in Chicago singing that everybody dies in the summer wanna say ya goodbyes tell them while its spring. but now being the mature adult hes grown into Chance is choosing to truly do something about the issues in Chicago PERIOD

Good deeds aside he never seems to let down with the music he releases PERIOD While its been well over two years since his critically lauded Acid Rap Chance has still managed to hop on a ton of features most notably Donnie Trumpets Surf and drop a couple singles along the way PERIOD Not only does he provide a refreshing face to the rap game with his wild adlibs alongside his genius and witty lyricism but he also does not discriminate when it comes to features PERIOD In the past two years alone hes been alongside electronic artist James Blake comedianturnedrapper Childish Gambino Skrillex Justin Bieber Lil Wayne Wale and even Madonnna PERIOD Also noteworthy is a tape of freestyles with Lil B the Based God PERIOD Finally never letting free time creep into his schedule he even acted in a thoughtprovoking short film called Mr PERIOD Happy. usually when artists take a minor hiatus especially in the realm of hiphop fans tend to get antsy and rude PERIOD However it seems Chance knows how to hold over his fans and though each one of his verses may not be drenched in gold he always manages to entertain and show extreme creativity with whatever he does PERIOD During a stop at Austin City Limits on his Family Matters Tour he performed a brand new track and proceeded to end it with the wordsthird mixtape. not only did this song sound incredible but upon hearing confirmation of Chance dropping a third mixtape hiphop fans were essentially sent into cardiac arrest PERIOD

I still remember the first time I heard Acid Rap. it was my first exposure to Chance and I found myself rather neutral PERIOD His bars were creative even though I found his voice a bit annoying and I couldnt understand what the weird screeching sound thats in every song was PERIOD Spoiler alert its his adlib PERIOD But I found myself constantly revisiting it slowly gaining appreciation for the songs PERIOD Like most others the first song that clicked was a ballad of simpler times Cocoa Butter Kisses featuring Twista and Vic Mensa PERIOD Once I finally realized what he was saying thanks RapGenius my jaw dropped PERIOD Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy Tommy and Chuckie  And Chuck E PERIOD Cheeses pizzas Jesus pieces sing Jesus loves me is a line that alludes to his past that is so cleverly written I couldnt help but have a giant smirk on my face the first time I read through that song PERIOD After that I found myself going through the entire mixtape with RapGenius open on my computer allowing myself to truly understand the mind of Chance the Rapper PERIOD While Acid Rap collectively was extremely diverse his creative reach didnt stop there PERIOD Though Surf an album released for free by Donnie Trumpet  the SoX didnt blow me away by any means songs like Windows Sunday Candy and Slip Slide truly began to showcase the variety Chance had and eventually it came to fruition that Chance the Rapper wasnt just Chance the Rapper he was Chance the Artist PERIOD

Overall I cant talk up Chance enough PERIOD Hes done so much for his community and fans and remains unsigned to a major label all while continuously releasing music PERIOD Plus hes now a soontobe father PERIOD Congratulations Chance and remember family does matter PERIOD
