After the reading the audience was invited to ask questions about her writing process and particularly about the transition from undergraduate to MFA student to published writer PERIOD

Russell said there are advantages to going to an MFA program PERIOD Almost all her stories from this collection were written at Columbia and revised over and over again in peer workshops PERIOD The MFA program also connected Russell with agents and editors interested in publishing her work PERIOD

I had to be proactive and tell myself that Im never going to write the perfect story so Im going to send my stories out now Russell said PERIOD

Slouka pointed out the differences between a Ph.D program and an MFA program PERIOD He said that coming from a Ph.D program he wrote like a critic and had to reteach himself how to write PERIOD

Reading and writing for two years is a joy Russell said of her MFA experience PERIOD But it was a crazy thing to do. its nice to know that my novel has a home already said Russell of her promised novel PERIOD  It feels like Ive sold them real estate that doesnt exist yet. russell said she would love to write more short stories but novels are more economically promising PERIOD

When asked if Russell has a fantasy life of doing something different and practical she said that she works in a veterinary center for that very reason but wouldnt give up writing for anything PERIOD

Even on a bad day I might have written the worst sentence in the world but its not like I killed a man she said PERIOD
