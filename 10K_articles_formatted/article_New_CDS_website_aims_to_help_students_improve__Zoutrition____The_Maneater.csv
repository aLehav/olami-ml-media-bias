In order to streamline and modernize the college dining experience Campus Dining Services has introduced Zoutritionhttp128...144NetNutritionHome.aspx an online tool for students to fully customize their dining experience PERIOD

The service features full menus of all dining halls and most other restaurants on campus PERIOD Students can create meals by choosing listed foods and beverages which appear on the side of the web page PERIOD Once a meal is completed students can view information such as calorie count fat content and percent daily value of vitamins PERIOD

When selecting items students can also select boxes to exclude menu items including allergens such as wheat milk and peanuts as well as items conflicting with vegetarian and vegan diets PERIOD

Previously CDS gave dining halls printed menus with the nutritional content of foods PERIOD There was a significant student push to move the service online and after more than two years of development the site debuted for the fall semester PERIOD

The company helping to develop the website also provides CDS with its cash register software PERIOD No web design or computer programming students were involved PERIOD

It was a need that we saw and we had a lot of requests for CDS Marketing Manager Michael Wuest said PERIOD This was definitely a studentdriven product. wuest said student response to the service has been positive PERIOD CDS had a booth set up during Fall Welcome for students to browse PERIOD

We were showcasing Zoutrition and we probably had  to  students come through he said PERIOD They were very excited about it. students said the website could be convenient to their dining needs PERIOD

It would be convenient for people with lactose intolerance and its just a good tool for dining purposes freshman David Klein said PERIOD

The website is not completely allinclusive PERIOD Freshman Meghan Eldridge is allergic to tree nuts and peanuts and expressed concerns about the service PERIOD

I dont think its in a stage yet that is foolproof she said PERIOD

Nonetheless Wuest said the site is being improved every day PERIOD Students can personally meet dining hall chefs and go through recipes thoroughly to customize meals to their individual needs PERIOD

We take allergies very seriously and try to make sure that every student has a good nutritional experience Wuest said PERIOD

Wuest also spoke about what roles he hopes the site serves PERIOD

I think its just an enhancement of our dining program more than anything he said PERIOD It really gives us this other element of the program this online nutritional resource for our customers PERIOD Its a great system it works very well and to be able to go on at any time and plan out how youre eating for the week. the site is advertised on placards on dining hall tables and can be accessed through the CDS websitedining.missouri.edu PERIOD
