Updated November     pm



After an abysmal start to the season with yesterdays  loss to Arizona State the Hawaii womens soccer team looked to handle the task of refocusing itself against Texas PERIOD

Even with a rainbow in the distance to start the match as a potentially auspicious sign the Wahine  found themselves stymied by the organized offense from the Longhorns  as they fell  in their second match of the season in front of an announced crowd of  attendants PERIOD

Despite having played on the previous night the Wahine had only two changes up top in their lineup to start the match PERIOD As the match got under way Hawaii did well to maintain better possession of the ball compared to last night PERIOD

Taking advantage of the early possession Hawaii capitalized as Krystal Pascua turned with the ball placing a strike past the keeper to the upper left part of the goal in the fifth minute PERIOD Pascua continued her on the ball performance as she forced a save by the Longhorn goalkeeper in the seventeenth minute PERIOD

Despite not taking a shot until the twenty-third minute an opportunity for the Longhorns arose as Julia Dyche scored an equalizer from twelve yards after being found by a slotted pass from Lindsey Meyer PERIOD

As the second half of the match began both sides looked for the gamewinning goal as Ryan Daniels header for the Wahine went wide just inside the sixtieth minute while Monk Berger stopped four shots from the Texas offense PERIOD

Eventually Texas found a hint of inspiration that led to a long distance strike by Jaynes Whitney from outside the  yard box to the upper right of the goal in the seventy-third minute which proved to be the game winning goal PERIOD

The efficiency of the Texas offense was apparent as they amassed a total of eight shots seven of which were on goal PERIOD Hawaii on the other hand matched the eight shots but only three were on goal PERIOD

Although UH tried to rally near the end of the match they struggled to create any opportunities as the Texas defense remained stalwart until the final whistle PERIOD

The Wahine take on Northern Illinois in the first match of the OHANA Hotels and Resorts No Ka Oi tournament on Aug PERIOD twenty-eighth PERIOD
