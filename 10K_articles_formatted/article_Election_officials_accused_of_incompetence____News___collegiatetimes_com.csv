Following mistakes at Montgomery County polls during the last election county voting officials must now travel to Richmond to answer to the State Board of Elections PERIOD

If you cant trust the process you cant trust the outcome said Christiansburg local Terry Ellen Carter who made the complaints that have resulted in the Richmond meeting PERIOD

Montgomery County Registrar Randy Wertz and the three members of the countys electoral board Cynthia Chappelka Helen Young and Dean Dowdy have been asked to attend a meeting with the SBE on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

In her second letter of complaint to the SBE Carter requested that the board members be dismissed and that Wertz be fired for their collective and individual incompetence. problems with the polls began early on the morning of Nov PERIOD   when the electronic poll books malfunctioned at several polling locations in the county PERIOD

The  election was to be the first year Montgomery County would use entirely electronic poll books PERIOD These simply allow workers to check whether people who show up to vote are actually registered for that precinct PERIOD

However in the seven precincts where the electronic poll books failed workers allowed voters to cast electronic ballots without checking whether they were actually registered for that precinct PERIOD

In her letter Carter stated that at least  votes equal to . percent of votes cast in Montgomery County were compromised and she requested that these votes be thrown out PERIOD

According to Carter several reasons were given to why the electronic poll books failed to work PERIOD

There were different reasons coming from different places and thats when you know that theres something else going on  that the problem is coming from the top down Carter said PERIOD

On the morning of Election Day in response to questions about the polling problems Wertz told the Collegiate Times that many volunteers who worked the polls were elderly and unsure of how to correctly use the new technology PERIOD

The average age is anywhere from  to  Wertz said on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD A lot of these individuals have never been around a laptop and even though we had  or so training sessions some were still not comfortable with the new technology. poor training was one the reasons Carter cited in her letter for the mistakes made at the polls PERIOD She also said that many of the volunteers were working with incomplete sets of instructions PERIOD

The original instructions were quite lengthy so Mr PERIOD Wertz took the liberty of making that more concise and left out a step Carter said PERIOD If youre doing something brand new you need a back up plan. carter argued that Wertz should have ordered the use of provisional ballots which are backup ballots that can be used if there are no paper or electronic poll books available PERIOD

They can be set aside after they are cast and sorted through at a later time to see if they were cast in the correct precinct PERIOD

After becoming aware of the polling problems Carter had both written and spoken with the Montgomery County Electoral Board before contacting the SBE PERIOD

She said she made several complaints about Wertz including that he should have used provisional ballots but they just told me hes doing a great job she said PERIOD I felt that they listened to me but I felt like they just didnt care. carter said she does not know what to expect from the Jan PERIOD  meeting but that she is grateful to see something being done PERIOD

According to Electoral Board member Chappelka the board has decided not to talk with the press until after the Jan PERIOD  meeting PERIOD

Wertz was also unavailable for comment PERIOD
