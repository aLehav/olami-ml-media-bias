The Texas AM Softball Complex was built in  and will soon undergo renovations to achieve a standard that will rival other SEC facilities PERIOD

Kyle Field is not the only stadium undergoing renovation PERIOD The Aggie Softball Complex will receive a new look as part of The Next Step Campaign an ongoing development of AMs athletic complexes thanks to the twelfth Man Foundation PERIOD

The softball complex was built back in  and was one of the best in its time said Jason Cook senior associate athletics director but other schools have updated their facilities since then PERIOD

All of the schools in the SEC have outstanding stadiums in several sports Cook said PERIOD That tells you the level of our competition. the softball complex has received improvements over the years Cook said like updated outfield walls the existing scoreboard which was added in  and the removal of the roof over the grandstand in  PERIOD They have updated the field itself and added batting cages and bullpens PERIOD

Recruits are always looking for good fields along with uptodate facilities and amenities Cook said PERIOD Most importantly though they want to see what level of commitment the school is putting toward the program he said PERIOD

Alan Cannon associate A.D PERIOD for media relations said that while the playing surface is still in outstanding condition the press boxes and other amenities are below par PERIOD

While sports like football and basketball have an easier time raising money for renovations other sports have trouble just to break even Cannon said PERIOD Since state funding is not readily available Aggie Athletics has to rely on donors and ticket sales Cannon said PERIOD

There are also the fans to consider when thinking about the renovations Cook said PERIOD

We believe that we have the best softball fans in the country he said PERIOD We want to make sure our facilities are reflective of our fan base. architectural planning is projected to begin in August PERIOD
