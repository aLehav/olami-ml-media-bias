Hes said it before and he said it again PERIOD

During yesterdays weekly Big Ten teleconference Penn State mens basketball head coach Ed DeChellis mentioned what his team is planning to work on during the upcoming bye week PERIOD

But everything he said has been mentioned before as possible solutions to problems currently plaguing the Nittany Lions PERIOD

DeChellis is perplexed by his teams current sixgame slide and is searching for something anything to hang his hat on PERIOD

 he said yesterday PERIOD 

But during the same teleconference one week ago his remedy sounded oddly similar PERIOD

 DeChellis said during the Jan PERIOD  teleconference PERIOD 

The fundamentals DeChellis were referring to included defense and taking advantage of rebounds PERIOD

The zone defense that perplexed Big Ten foes last season just does not seem to have the same impact this year but has it been poor defense or better offense

 Minnesota coach Jim Molinari said yesterday PERIOD 

The intensity of the Lions defense has gone down greatly since last season PERIOD

Their numbers are down significantly from the  campaign PERIOD Penn State is surrendering   more points per contest than last year PERIOD

Opponents are also shooting  percent better from the field and  percent better from threepoint range against the Lions than they were last season PERIOD

 DeChellis said PERIOD 

Against Minnesota oftenoverlooked role players stepped up with career games to help beat Penn State PERIOD But during much of the Big Ten season the Lions have had trouble stopping their opponents top scoring threats PERIOD

 DeChellis said PERIOD 

Purdues Carl Landry and David Teague two of the Big Tens topfive scorers combined for  points in their win over the Lions PERIOD

Next came Indianas Roderick Wilmont who drained seven threes enroute to a 25point night at the Bryce Jordan Center PERIOD

Finally the leagues toptwo scorers Michigan States Drew Neitzel and Iowas Adam Haluska litup the Lions during consecutive games both Penn State losses PERIOD The two scoring fiends combined for  points against the muchmaligned Penn State defense PERIOD

DeChellis may have found the problem PERIOD The Lions have allowed the stars to score PERIOD But correcting the problem has not been easy PERIOD

The Lions have however been able to solve their earlyseason rebounding problem PERIOD Penn State was out rebounded during three of its first five Big Ten games PERIOD

But now Ed DeChelliss squad has regained its normal advantage on the glass PERIOD But the Lions have just not been able to capitalize on their work under the boards PERIOD

Against Minnesota the Lions grabbed  offensive rebounds but were only able to cash them into  points PERIOD

The numbers were even more mind boggling when Penn State traveled to Iowa PERIOD Although the Lions held a  advantage in offensive rebounds the Hawkeyes still outscored the Lions in secondchance points PERIOD

So DeChellis identified a problem and corrected it PERIOD But immediately another problem reared its head PERIOD

Its been a difficult beginning to conference play for DeChellis and his squad PERIOD The team has not lived up to preseason expectations PERIOD But the Lions are desperately trying to shake themselves of their current funk and steal a win on Saturday against Purdue PERIOD

But in order to beat the Boilermakers Penn State needs to fix its problems PERIOD And considering weve heard the same answers for the past few weeks the troubles may continue until the Lions can grasp the DeChellis teachings PERIOD

 DeChellis said PERIOD
