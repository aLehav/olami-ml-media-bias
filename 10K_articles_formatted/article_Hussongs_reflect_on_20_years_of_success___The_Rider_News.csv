Rider field hockey has had a total of five head coaches in its 41year history and only one has lasted more than seven seasons PERIOD

Head Coach Lori Hussong and her husband Dan who is her lead assistant have transformed a program that was synonymous with losing throughout the late 1990s  with a record of  from   to a dominant force over the last  years in the Northeast Conference NEC and Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference MAAC PERIOD No current Rider coaches have been here longer than the  years the Hussongs have PERIOD

Before Rider the Hussongs had successful coaching and teaching careers at West WindsorPlainsboro schools  miles away from Rider PERIOD Ironically enough Lori Hussong was Dan Hussongs assistant coach when he led the boys basketball team PERIOD To no surprise Lori Hussong was a successful field hockey coach with a high school career record of  PERIOD

When they took the job at Rider in  the Rider field hockey team was  in its last two seasons PERIOD Lori Hussong said they inherited a group of unorganized little fireballs. the turn of the century and control of the program also marked a new era of success for years to come PERIOD

That year we did finish below . but we actually snuck into the conference championship and the playoffs and ended up upsetting the No PERIOD  seed and the No PERIOD  seed and winning the NEC championship Lori Hussong said over a Zoom call PERIOD The look on their faces at the end of the season they just totally believed in what we were doing. we said This is what were doing they didnt ever question us PERIOD They would run through a wall for us and to see their faces at the end of the last game that was the best feeling in the world to see that. dan Hussong said the Rider teams in the few years before they took over did all the things that losing teams do. the championship was the first of  consecutive postseason appearances both in the MAAC and NEC and three NEC titles PERIOD After getting her first win of the  season Lori Hussong became the fifteenth active Division I Head Coach with at least  wins PERIOD

She now has  wins and counting PERIOD

In  they took a group of unorganized players and developed a winning culture PERIOD Something they have continued to do ever since PERIOD It is important to them that every player knows they are a piece of a bigger picture PERIOD

Thats a key to coaching success Dan Hussong said is to take star athletes  and Lori would often say this to the team  everyone here was the best on their high school team thats why youre here PERIOD Now you have to reinvent yourself and find your role in how youre going to make this new team now Division I college team better than all the other teams that were going to play PERIOD You want them to feel like a star but corporate with the other stars on the team PERIOD Then youve got the magic. the magic is not created in a day or a week PERIOD It takes time for players to buy into what the Hussongs are preaching PERIOD When they are out recruiting players they market themselves as parents who will take care of them PERIOD Sophomore midfielder Kiki van Ommeren who hails from the Netherlands said they made Rider feel like home PERIOD

The Hussongs host the team for a dinner at their house before the start of every semester and have the players over for a holiday party where they played bingo and make gingerbread houses before the fall semester ends in December PERIOD

The fact that they are married and have five children of their own creates a family dynamic within the team PERIOD One of their daughters Colby Hussong was a player at Hofstra and an opponent of Rider on multiple occasions PERIOD

Senior defender Brittany Romanczuk said some members of the team even call Lori Hussong Mom. field hockey is always on their minds even at home to the point where Lori Hussong said her kids ask them to not talk about Rider field hockey at dinner. telling recruits parents they will care for their daughter as if she is one of their own is a pitch the Hussongs make on the recruiting trail PERIOD Its especially difficult when recruiting international players because theyre starting a whole new life in America PERIOD When former midfielder Marion Waterkeyn  arrived in America as a freshman the Hussongs were waiting for her at the gate like a parent picking up their child after a trip PERIOD

When I landed in Newark International Airport I was totally on my own in a new country with another language a different culture and so on said Waterkeyn who is from Belgium PERIOD Then I suddenly saw two faces I recognized from my Skype conversations waiting for me at the exit Dan and Lori PERIOD They picked me up from the airport and were extremely welcoming and great at putting me at ease PERIOD The next morning they helped me find my dorm and introduced me to the rest of the team PERIOD  As soon as I arrived I already felt part of the Rider field hockey team and now I really miss it. playing for the Hussongs is what made Romanczuk choose Rider when she was picking schools three years ago PERIOD

It was very familyoriented Romanczuk said PERIOD I was watching one of their games and if someone made a mistake or something they didnt scream at them or something like that PERIOD They just let them play and then they talked to them after PERIOD The reason why I came to Rider was because of the coaches. our motto has always been Give your best effort in all that you do so our jobs as college coaches are not just to build the best team possible Lori Hussong said PERIOD Its to build the best person possible to when they leave the university and our team theyre better people and we know theyre going to be successful with whatever job they pursue or whatever path they pursue. romanczuk and van Ommeren both described the Hussongs as the most intense coaches they have ever had  and for good reason PERIOD It brings out the best in them PERIOD

After a  loss to Georgetown last season the team walked off the field emotionless PERIOD They gathered their bottles and jackets laid down their sticks wrapped in black grip tape and walked back to the goal cage PERIOD

A typical Division I field hockey game lasts  minutes PERIOD

Lori Hussongs postgame speech lasted around  minutes PERIOD

It shows how competitive they are and how committed they are to get the team as far as possible since theyre there for  years so they really like what theyre doing and I think also it makes the team better in a way van Ommeren said PERIOD If theyre so competitive and so committed the team will also be more committed and competitive. van Ommeren said she has never had a coach as competitive as Lori and Dan Hussong PERIOD

Rider doesnt do a college yearbook anymore and there are no college superlatives as some people remember from high school PERIOD But if there were a superlative to be offered for college coaches Romanczuk said the Hussongs would win Most intense and Most likely to never retire adding she could see them coaching for another five to  years PERIOD

Dan Hussong said if Lori Hussong were to leave he would go PERIOD If it were the other way around Lori Hussong would stay put PERIOD

Were happy Dan Hussong laughed PERIOD

As long as were happy doing it Lori Hussong said were going to keep doing it. follow Dylan Manfre on Twitter for the latest on Rider field hockey PERIOD",Hussongs reflect on 20 years of success â€“ The Rider News,Rider University
