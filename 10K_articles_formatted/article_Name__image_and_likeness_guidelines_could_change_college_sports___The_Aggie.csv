New NIL guidelines lay groundwork for the future of college athletics



By KATHERIN RAYGOZA  sportstheaggie.org



The question whether college athletes should get paid is often brought up and is constantly enduring changes in the legislature especially for future athletes PERIOD Name image and likeness NIL the elements comprising right of publicity is the only thing able to answer this question PERIOD

Part of the debate includes that the National Collegiate Athletic Association NCAA generates over  billion annually from athletics PERIOD The other part of the debate is that college athletes are considered amateurs and paying them would mean they have to be considered professionals PERIOD

One of the NCAAs greatest obligations to players writes Erik Cilburn a writer from Insight Into Diversity PERIOD Especially those who come from communities of color and lowincome households should be ensuring they are prepared for a future that may not include a lucrative professional sports career. federal legislation has allowed NCAA Division I student athletes to receive pay by their NIL PERIOD That includes receiving endorsement deals using social media to profit from their sport and they can now use their signatures on memorabilia for profit PERIOD

With the variety of state laws adopted across the country we will continue to work with Congress to develop a solution that will provide clarity on a national level said NCAA President Mark Emmert in a statement PERIOD The current environment  both legal and legislative  prevents us from providing a more permanent solution and the level of detail studentathletes deserve. in the past the NCAA prohibited athletes from receiving any sort of income from their sport by arguing that it would change the sport and that it would make fans less likely to watch or buy tickets PERIOD Fans who are college sport enthusiasts support NIL and  of them said that NIL should continue on in the future PERIOD

Im fired up said P.J Fleck head coach for the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team PERIOD Im fired up about name image and likeness PERIOD I think its tremendous PERIOD Our location the Twin City area the three and a half million people we have in our city the  Fortune  companies this isnt a small little college town PERIOD We have businesses galore and now have the ability for our players to benefit off their name with all of these companies. since athletes can get profit from personalities and identity this means that they can benefit financially by providing services for their pay. this can be seen in the form of being paid millions of dollars to promote a company or get a few hundred dollars from starting a YouTube channel or helping run a summer camp PERIOD

Before the NIL floodgates opened in  said Alex Kirshner a writer from Global States Matter PERIOD Plenty of people around college sports claimed that compensating athletes would distract them overwhelm them or make it harder for them to focus on competition and schooling PERIOD In the months since NIL deals were allowed by the NCAA athletes have instead found that the new rules are not only often lucrative but freeing. universities and colleges benefit financially from these athletes especially basketball and football players PERIOD While these student athletes work hard  not only in their sport but also are full time students PERIOD These players win championships for their schools and the schools are profiting from the athletes PERIOD Championships bring in revenue such as championship merchandise and the student athletes dont receive any percentages from the profits PERIOD

An example of this is Texas University running back Bijan Robinson who after returning from an injury in April  signed his sixth NIL deal with a Texas Lamborghini dealership a month later PERIOD He announced his partnership on Instagram PERIOD

The biggest downside about NIL is that international student athletes cannot receive any sort of payment in the U.S PERIOD and more than  NCAA athletes are left out PERIOD Visas that are provided to studentsathletes only allow limited employment whether that is on or off campus work PERIOD If these rules are broken serious consequences can occur such as being removed from the team deportation and unable to renew a visa PERIOD

Canadian hammer thrower Camryn Rogers who attended UC Berkeley is a supporter of loosening endorsement plans for athletes PERIOD But a UC Berkeley compliance officer warned international athletes they could possibly be deported PERIOD

That word hit me very very hard Rogers said PERIOD To see it come to fruition is so exciting but at the end of the day for international studentathletes its like it never happened. there is no clear prediction what will happen with the name image and likeness of the athletes in the future PERIOD But with several opposing viewpoints on NIL it will continue to be one of the most talked about topics of this next season PERIOD
