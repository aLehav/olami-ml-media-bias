Updated November     pm



Middle Eastern student voices are shaking up Sunday nights at the Titan Internet Radio station PERIOD Middle Eastern Student Society members along with other sponsors set up Off the Hookah last semester for students interested in listening to a unique interactive talk show about culture politics religion and sports  from the Middle East to the Orange County PERIOD

The Internet radio talk show airs every Sunday from 7p.m PERIOD to 8p.m PERIOD Students can get Off the Hookah by tuning in to the live show at httptir.fullerton.edu PERIOD By calling in students get a chance to win free gifts and speak to guests live PERIOD

Last week the talk show invited Arabic composer and rapper Shady Nasar to the station PERIOD Nasar accepted calls from encouraging fans and family and spoke about some of the people that inspired him during the time he composed his musical pieces PERIOD

Students involved in the show said that Off the Hookah spends its hourlong show raising local and international political issues and providing entertainment updates and guest appearances PERIOD

Every week is different depending what the issue of the week is said Rashad AlDabbagh president of MESS PERIOD Last week we had the whole show about the situation in Lebanon Syrian intervention in Lebanon and the things going on after Harirris assassination. the shows founders Fahmi Farahat and Talal Al Kaissi said they hope the show will reach a variety of students from different ethnic backgrounds with different cultural and political interests PERIOD

I thought it was a good idea to outreach to the students Farahat said PERIOD Our targets are the Americans who are interested in Arabic culture but dont know much about it  the political science majors or people who are interested in knowing whats going on in the Middle East and specifically ArabAmericans. from the M.E PERIOD to the O.C. is the slogan of Off the Hookah representing the idea behind the show news entertainment and sports updates from the Middle East to Orange County PERIOD They update listeners with the Middle Eastern views as well the views of ArabAmericans here in Orange County PERIOD

We wanted to give it a cool theme to target college students Farahat said PERIOD We thought of something cultural and Talal came up with Off the Hookah. the Off the Hookah crew consists of Lina AlAgha Rashad AlDabbagh Talal Kaissi and Fahmi Farahat a group of Middle Eastern students some of which are RadioTVFilm majors providing a voice for different countries in the Middle East PERIOD

I think people should listen to us because there is such a good integration of different types of people here and because we all can sit down in a forum and talk about Middle Eastern issues helping us recognize our identities AlAgha said PERIOD
