How much sleep do you really need Ive been averaging  hours a night since the eighth grade and Im thriving PERIOD I really dont need sleep or maybe Ive just built up a tolerance PERIOD I believe that doing as much as humanly possible in a day leads to fulfillment and natural exhaustion PERIOD

The way this works for me is by conducting a balancing act PERIOD I have my internship for professionalism classes for education intramurals for exercise and clubs for interaction PERIOD In my spare time Ive been teaching myself how to play the piano PERIOD Thanks YouTube PERIOD

Think about it theres  hours in a day PERIOD If you only sleep for five of them then that leaves  hours to live it up PERIOD Naps have negative effects because they teach your body to feed off of sleep PERIOD I have trained myself to feed off of activity PERIOD When I wake up Im excited to seize the day PERIOD

My completely madeup and unqualified theory is that when I sleep my body is taking advantage of the little time it has and works to the max PERIOD Another theory Im putting out into the universe is that less sleep builds your immune system PERIOD I never get sick PERIOD I expose myself to the elements when I walk to and from campus everyday and I spend time in many public places PERIOD

Unfortunately science has proven all my theories wrong but how am I the only exception to these rules I once slept for  hours and felt exhaustion like nothing else PERIOD While sitting in class I could hardly pay attention PERIOD When I got home I felt so lazy and had zero motivation PERIOD This lifestyle is not for everyone PERIOD In fact when I tell people about my habits they arent sure how Im functioning either PERIOD

I guess one day Ill look back and just have ten times more memories than everyone else PERIOD Or maybe Ill die earlier PERIOD We will have to see PERIOD But for now you can catch me going  mph PERIOD If anyone out there is also living this college experience hit me up PERIOD
