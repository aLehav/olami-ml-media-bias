Less than a month away from the  presidential election the first presidential debate left many Americans in a state of pessimism and uncertainty about the future of the United States PERIOD

On Tuesday Sept PERIOD  in Cleveland former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump faced off in a brutish debate during one of the most unprecedented times in modern U.S PERIOD history PERIOD The debate was moderated by Fox News anchor Chris Wallace PERIOD

Although the debate became somewhat personal given Trumps jeers and ad hominem attacks against Biden and his familyespecially Hunter Bidenthe two debated on some important topics pertaining to the United States PERIOD The debate can be broken down into several important topics picked by Wallace including the Supreme Court vacancy the COVID19 pandemic protests and violence in cities as a result of the issue of racism and the economy PERIOD

Following the tragic death of former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg the Supreme Court vacancy has become a point of interest for Republicans PERIOD Less than two weeks after RBGs death Trump announced he would nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court PERIOD

Several Republicans including South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell have been criticized for their hypocritical comments on blocking Obamas nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in  claiming it would be unfair to Americans to vote for a justice during an election year PERIOD
Biden countered Trumps claims warning that Barretts potentially successful nomination will solidify a  conservative majority in the Supreme Court PERIOD As a result Republicans will be able to repeal Roe v PERIOD Wade and the Affordable Care Act unraveling years of progressive lawmaking that could strip away healthcare accessibility and benefits for many Americans especially women PERIOD

COVID19 also became a major point of discussion during the debate PERIOD Trump has been criticized for holding several rallies without masks or social distancing enforcement as the U.S PERIOD has surpassed  thousand coronavirus deaths PERIOD Trump taunted Biden during the debate for his maskwearing saying I dont wear a mask like him PERIOD Every time you see him hes got a mask PERIOD He could be speaking  feet away from you and he shows up with the biggest mask Ive ever seen. less than  hours after the debate on Oct PERIOD  Trump announced he tested positive for COVID19 PERIOD He tweeted Tonight FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID19. trump was promptly hospitalized at Walter Reed Hospital and treated with an experimental antibody treatment steroids and oxygen PERIOD He has since been released PERIOD
Perhaps the most shocking part of the debate was Trumps failure to condemn white supremacists PERIOD Wallace challenged Trump asking if he is willing to condemn white supremacists and militia groups. both Wallace and Biden pushed Trump to condemn white supremacists PERIOD After asking for a specific group to condemn Biden suggested the Proud Boys a farright fascist organization that spouts antiSemitic Islamophobic and other bigoted rhetoric PERIOD
Trump stated Proud Boys stand back and stand by. trumps comments caused an uproar PERIOD Stand back and stand by suggests that these groups wait for his command and is not a condemnation of their actions PERIOD

The debate left one question who won For many Americans the answer is no one PERIOD The nation is at a standstill between polarizing political beliefs and a chaotic year defined by a pandemic and socioracial upheaval PERIOD
Many viewers felt as though the true loser of the debate was the United States itself PERIOD Between the U.S PERIOD nearing almost  thousand coronavirus deaths millions of Americans having filed for unemployment and facing eviction since the pandemic started and growing social unrest the U.S PERIOD faces a desolate political landscape PERIOD
Only time will tell if the U.S PERIOD can muster the strength and unity necessary to overcome the hardships that have plagued this country PERIOD
After Trumps COVID19 diagnosis the Commission on Presidential Debates decided that the second presidential debate initially scheduled for Oct PERIOD  would be canceled citing Trumps refusal to participate in a virtual debate PERIOD
Both candidates have instead opted to host their own respective virtual town halls on Oct PERIOD  at  p.m. with NBC covering Trumps town hall and ABC covering Biden PERIOD

The next debate is scheduled for Thursday Oct PERIOD  in Nashville moderated by NBCs White House correspondent Kristen Welker PERIOD

On Wednesday March  Providence College Democrats and Republicans held a debate on gun control PERIOD

Madison Clark  and Bryan Bates  represented the PC Democrats while Krista Minniti  and Charlie Dumon  represented the PC Republicans PERIOD Dr PERIOD Joe Cammarano a professor of public and community service and political science at the College acted as the moderator and enforced the structural components of the debate PERIOD

The first question that was posed was Will gun regulations make a community safer

The PC Democrats began with their argument asserting that statistics have proven that communities with higher levels of gun ownership have higher levels of gun violence per capita PERIOD

Clark argued that through the creation of gun regulations imposing consistent background checks and restricting opencarry laws a community would become safer PERIOD Bates added to this argument statingSome people say cars are more dangerous than guns PERIOD Instead of outlawing them we regulated them to make sure they are safer for society as a whole. in response PC Republicans argued that gun regulations would not make a community safer PERIOD

Minniti argued that a large percentage of reported gun violence was attributed to suicide and illegally owned handguns which would be attained through the black market no matter the amount of regulations imposed PERIOD She used Canada as an example of a country with higher gun rates per capita and lower homicide rates than the U.S PERIOD to further emphasize her point that regulations are not the answer to making a community safer PERIOD

Dumon took a more radical approach in his contribution citing the Sutherland Springs Church shooting in  PERIOD He claimed that Deregulations are something that will make the community safer. dumon stated that the only thing that ended the massacre was a good guy with a gun. each side was given one minute to offer a rebuttal to the opposing sides argument PERIOD The Democratic side chose to approach the point brought up in regards to suicide PERIOD

Clark stated Over twothirds of deaths related to guns are also related to suicide. people who choose to use guns for a method of suicide are more likely to actually die as opposed to those who choose to use pain killers or other methods PERIOD Clark concluded that reducing the availability of guns has an impact on whether or not a person actually dies. the Republican members refocused on the homicide rates claiming that creating further gun regulations would only cause more people to access the black market PERIOD They cited Chicago as a city that has some of the strictest regulations on guns in the country and yet has a very high homicide rate PERIOD

The second predetermined question that Dr PERIOD Cammarano posed was How should schools prepare for active shooters

The Republicans initiated the debate beginning with the assertion that schools should have at least one armed officer and there should be training for teachers on how to use a firearem PERIOD

Dumon argued that it would be more efficient and beneficial for a teacher to have a gun in order to minimize carnage PERIOD He emphasized the amount of time it would take to respond to a shooter without having a gun by counting the seconds it would take to walk to the fire exit attempt to get the fire extinguisher and successfully disable the shooter PERIOD

The Democrats argued that instead of giving teachers guns people should be confronting the motivations and underlying causes of why individuals commit school shootings PERIOD Instead of arming staff on school grounds Clark argued that there should be resources provided to educate teachers on how to resolve conflict without violence PERIOD

Clark also asserted that the presence of an armed officer might add to existing tensions particularly in racially diverse schools PERIOD Bates added resource officers can be a good asset if they are guided on how to use their expertise within schools specifically PERIOD

Another question was How should the Second Amendment be understood

Minniti began the argument for the Republican side by stating that it should be interpreted in the most literal sense PERIOD She claimed Without the Second Amendment there is nothing that stands between citizens and anarchy for it was initially created for defense against totalitarianism PERIOD Tyranny Minniti asserted is not a thing of the past PERIOD

Dumon elaborated on this tangent stating The Second Amendment was the greatest gift that God ever imposed on the USA because it protects all other protections PERIOD He cited tyrannical leaders such as Adolf Hitler Joseph Stalin Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong who took away peoples guns and thus took away their fundamental ability to defend themselves against their government PERIOD

Bates began the Democratic argument by stating that the Second Amendment and the Constitution itself is a living and breathing document. he argued that if people fail to interpret it in a modern context we wont be able to progress as a society PERIOD Bates stated that the Amendment was predicated on the idea of a wellregulated militia which they defined as state force PERIOD

Both Bates and Clark argued that the Amendment was built to be flexible and to fit the modern age PERIOD

Other questions involved how each side defined selfdefense if there should be a universal background check and if there should be any factors that disqualify someone from the right to bear arms PERIOD

Followed by the discussion of these predetermined questions was the opportunity for the audience to submit questions for the panel PERIOD

These questions addressed critical topics such as how one can objectively know whether or not a guy with a gun is good whether a teacher should be obligated to use a gun on a student who has a weapon standyourground laws and how realistic it is to argue that the Second Amendment protects the right to defend against tyranny when weapons of mass destruction exist PERIOD

This debate provided a unique opportunity for PC students to voice their opinions about a divise topic in a civil and engaging manner PERIOD

The debate titled There are some things that money should not buy brought in PCs associate professor of philosophy Dr PERIOD Colin King and Georgetown Universitys Dr PERIOD Jason Brennan PERIOD

The debate was centered around the idea of whether or not money can truly buy happiness PERIOD King and Brennan went head to head speaking about the value of life and how money can better it through a parliamentary style debate PERIOD Dr PERIOD King who flew to Providence from Switzerland argued that money should not be able to buy everything due to the fundamentals of ethics PERIOD

Dr PERIOD King brought up points such as grades and voting fraud money should not buy a vote and should not buy an A despite the students work saying otherwise PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Brennan argued for the negative and discussed that if there is somethingyou would not do for free you should not be able to pay for it PERIOD If you would do something however people should have the option to pay for it. brennan also brought up points such as prostitution being bad yet people pay for it however paying for a child was justified in the debate because of the establishment of adoption PERIOD
