 p.m PERIOD Feb PERIOD   Miami  No PERIOD  North Carolina

Following a thrilling win at home over Boston College the Hurricanes travel to Chapel Hill with their first of two opportunities to win doubledigit ACC contests PERIOD

It will be a tall order PERIOD The UNC Tar Heels are one of the hottest teams in the country heading into March boasting a sixgame winning streak PERIOD The formula fueling this hot streak is different from the one that led coach Roy Williams teams to backtoback title games PERIOD

Those teams had multiple dominant upperclassman who played inside and controlled the rebounding battle with the help of Justin Jackson on the perimeter PERIOD

Williams has adjusted that method PERIOD The team is now lead by junior Luke Maye a big man that shoots 3pointers and Joel Berry II who was last years Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four PERIOD

Instead of a couple dominant big men Maye and a deep group of solid wings consisting of Theo Pinson Pittsburgh transfer Cam Johnson and Kenny Williams have led the effort on the glass PERIOD

To win a tough game on the road Miami will need to do its best to limit the secondchance opportunities of the countrys leading offensiverebounding team PERIOD On offense the Canes must attack the basket relentlessly as UNC lacks a true shotblocking threat and is a bit undersized PERIOD Sophomore forward Dewan Huell could dominate against a small front court but it may not be enough PERIOD

Prediction North Carolina   Miami 



Noon March   Virginia Tech  Miami

Miami closes out its regular season against Virginia Tech which sits at an identical  ACC record going into the last week of the season PERIOD

A win over the Hokies would give the Canes the tiebreaker over North Carolina State Louisville and Virginia Tech all of which currently claim nine conference victories PERIOD So it could greatly benefit Miamis ACC Tournament seeding PERIOD

Coach Buzz Williams team is the only one in the conference that can say it beat Virginia which is currently the No PERIOD  team in the country PERIOD The Hokies have the talent to beat anybody so how can the Hurricanes pull off a win against them for a second time this season

In the first matchup between the two teams Miami dominated the glass  and got off to a hot shooting start to put away Virginia Tech PERIOD The Hokies duo of Justin Robinson and Justin Bibbs both played well combining for  points but fellow doubledigit scorers Ahmed Hill and Kerry Blackshear Jr PERIOD failed to do much of anything totaling just two points PERIOD

Part of VTechs strength is in its deep stable of scorers but if UM can turn two of them into nonfactors again thats a pretty good recipe for a win PERIOD

On offense look for the Canes to shoot away from deep  they knocked in  of  3pointers in their last matchup against the Hokies  and if they can connect on those looks they should ride into the postseason with another 10win ACC showing PERIOD



Prediction Miami   Virginia Tech 

The Miami Hurricane is the student newspaper of the University of Miami in Coral Gables Florida PERIOD The newspaper is edited and produced by undergraduate students at UM and is published in print every Tuesday and online everyday during the academic year PERIOD",ACC Predictions: UM looks to bolster tournament chances - The Miami Hurricane,University of Miami
