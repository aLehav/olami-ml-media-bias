Legacy Motor Club

Legacy Motor Club the NASCAR Cup Series team coowned by business guru Maury Gallagher and seventime NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson just inserted the final piece to their  puzzle naming John Hunter Nemechek the driver of their No PERIOD  Chevrolet Camaro starting next year PERIOD

With their driver lineup confirmed for next year Legacy Motor Club is a team that looks to take a massive step forward PERIOD This team has yet to look like the team that won the Southern  and had their best car finish No PERIOD  in the points standings PERIOD However there is optimism surrounding the team PERIOD

Men behind the wheel

Alongside Nemechek the team will retain Erik Jones for his fourth year PERIOD In the three years he has been with the team Jones has watched this team transition from Richard Petty Motorsports to Petty GMS Racing to Legacy Motor Club as Gallagher and Johnson entered the ownership group PERIOD Jones ontrack results have also improved winning the  Cook Out Southern  for his third career NASCAR Cup Series victory PERIOD

In  the team has primarily taken a step back but Jones has made the most of the situation posting four top10 finishes in the last eight weeks highlighted by a third place finish at Kansas Speedway PERIOD

As for Nemechek he is one of NASCARs top young drivers who is not competing in the NASCAR Cup Series this year PERIOD He currently drives the No PERIOD  Toyota Supra in the NASCAR Xfinity Series for Joe Gibbs Racing where he leads all drivers with six wins PERIOD He is one of the clear favorites to take home the championship in November PERIOD

Legacy Motor Club now has stability in the form of two young drivers as Nemechek and Jones are  and  years old respectively PERIOD

In  Legacy Motor Club will switch from its current manufacturer Chevrolet to Toyota PERIOD This move was announced on May  which was early in the season PERIOD However this move may have been explored as far back as January when the president of Toyota Racing Development

 said Wilson PERIOD 

Future success could explain current shortcomings

Toyota needed help and they have it for next year which may be why Legacy Motor Club is currently struggling PERIOD It is unknown exactly when Chevrolet found out that Legacy Motor Club would no longer field Camaros but they may have scaled back their technical and mechanical support significantly due to their future with Legacy Motor Club ending after this year PERIOD

The lack of sponsorship may be another reason for the teams struggles PERIOD Focus Factor Joness primary sponsor for most of last year chose not to return PERIOD As a result most of Gallaghers other businesses such as Allegiant Airlines and Sunseeker Resort have been on the cars for most of the season PERIOD

Gallaghers businesses were on their cars last year but the support of Focus Factor helped give the  team stability while they pieced together a season for the  PERIOD Now that Focus Factors support and money are gone the team has probably had to cut back in some areas where they didnt need to in  PERIOD Of course this is all speculation PERIOD It is not known exactly what is causing Legacy Motor Club to struggle but this is worth pointing out PERIOD

It is hard to tell what exactly Legacy Motor Club will become PERIOD In recent years the NASCAR Cup Series garage has seen several teams like Trackhouse Racing 23XI Racing and most recently RoushFenwayKeselowski Racing take a piece from the pie of success PERIOD

With many questions in the current season and significant moves being made for  the current issues plaguing the team may be temporary leaving hope for fans next year PERIOD
