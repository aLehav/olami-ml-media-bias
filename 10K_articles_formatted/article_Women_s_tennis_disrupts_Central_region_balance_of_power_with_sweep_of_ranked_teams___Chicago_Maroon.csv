2182,2022-03-16,"after a slow start to the season womens tennis got back to . in a hurry PERIOD

The Maroons upset a pair of nationallyranked squads on the road to solidify their status as a regional contender trouncing 22ndranked Luther  in Clinton IA Saturday and holding on to beat 29thranked Albion  Sunday in Albion MI PERIOD The victories evened the teams record on the year to  after an  start PERIOD The ninthregionallyranked Maroons were led by firstyears Vindya Dayananda Anuja Parikh and Alice Williams all of whom went undefeated in their singles matches PERIOD

It was a big step for our womens team to defeat two ranked teams in one weekend head coach Marty Perry said PERIOD Not only were they nationally ranked but they were ranked above us in the regional rankings PERIOD It means a lot to the program. from the opening serve the Maroons laid down the hammer against the Norse PERIOD The visitors swept the doubles competition to go up  and then took four of five singles matches to ice the victory PERIOD Chicago displayed its depth receiving victories from the pairings of Dayananda and thirdyear Ade OmodeleLucien Parikh and Williams fourthyear Annie Miller and firstyear Preetha Rajamani PERIOD

While the final margin was lopsided the individual matches were backandforth affairs PERIOD Dayananda the firstyear phenom from Kathmandu cruised to victory in first singles breezing past Luther thirdyear Annalise Conaway in straight sets   PERIOD 17thregionallyranked thirdyear Ade OmodeleLucien chipped in for Chicago coming from behind to edge 28thregionallyranked fourthyear Kirsten Madsen    at second singles PERIOD Parikh contributed with a marathon    decision at third over fourthyear Tasha Allemang PERIOD

In fourth singles Williams came up huge for the Maroons showing her composure as she gritted out a    win over thirdyear Molly Beyer PERIOD

Basically I got more focused Williams said PERIOD I hit all my shots and hit balls deeper and for a higher percentage

Firstyear Jackie Colvin finished things off for Chicago in sixth singles with a convincing   triumph over firstyear Taylor Cochrane PERIOD Fourthyear Tara Huinker provided the only bright spot for the Norse with a   win over fourthyear Annie Miller at fifth PERIOD

Im a little surprised about the result Perry said PERIOD But I know from my experience that they fight extremely hard whether theyre up or down PERIOD Theyve been doing that all year. the Maroons competitiveness on display against Luther was put to the test against the Britons PERIOD After dropping two of three doubles matches the Maroons were forced to play from behind and make up ground in singles PERIOD Led by their first years they did just that PERIOD

Dayananda ranked eleventh in the region eked out a   decision over 23rdregionallyranked fourthyear Katie Tornga PERIOD Down  midway through the second set she came back to take six of the next seven games for the victory PERIOD

Vindya did an awesome job of raising her level of play to the level of her first set after dropping behind in the second set Perry said PERIOD

Parikh once again took her match to three sets outlasting thirdyear Emily Stocker    PERIOD Williams dropped the first set in her match against secondyear Vic Seiter but stormed back winning the next  game for a    victory PERIOD

While the freshmen continued their strong play Miller clinched the meet with a   victory over Mara Rendina in fifth singles PERIOD Betsy Netherton and Emily Gundersen scored the lone Albion singles victories in the competition over OmodeleLucien and Colvin respectively PERIOD

Weve been practicing for a month and we actually executed what weve been practicing Williams said PERIOD Weve been progressing as a team and individually. with the wins the Maroons placed themselves in prime position to make a run at a place in the NCAA tournament PERIOD Bids go to the top eight teams in the region and Chicago ranked ninth is currently on the outside looking in PERIOD That may have changed after this weekend PERIOD With matches against Carthage and Wash U still looming on the schedule its still too early to make postseason plans but things are looking up for the upandcoming program PERIOD

We have the schedule to possibly make it the NCAAs Perry said PERIOD We know we cant get it a bid unless we keep on playing hard and improving PERIOD We the coaches were very pleased PERIOD I couldnt have asked for anything more from them this weekend PERIOD They gave it  percent. the Maroons look to keep their winning streak alive when they host 28thranked Carthage Saturday PERIOD
