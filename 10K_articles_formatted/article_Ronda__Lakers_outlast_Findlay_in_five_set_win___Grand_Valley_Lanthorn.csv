After sweeping five straight GLIAC opponents junior outside hitter Betsy Ronda and the red hot Grand Valley State University volleyball team found themselves in somewhat unfamiliar territory a competitive match PERIOD

The 10game win streak was on the line for GVSU at the University of Findlay on Saturday as the upandcoming Oilers and firstplace Lakers were deadlocked at  apiece late in the decisive fifth set PERIOD

GVSU coach Deanne Scanlon decided to call a timeout PERIOD

We had been up and down at that point but felt like we had something to prove Ronda said PERIOD Someone needed to step up and take charge thats what she was emphasizing going into that fifth set PERIOD There were some calls that werent going our way but she wanted us to focus on doing our jobs. the Lakers who had won  straight GLIAC matches dating back to last season showed why they are the No PERIOD  team in the country PERIOD

After the timeout Ronda tallied a kill from senior setter Kaitlyn Wolters to make it  PERIOD Then after Findlays Hannah Tong returned the favor to tie things up Ronda notched another PERIOD

Tong committed an attack error on the following play to give the Lakers a  edge which proved to be a big stop for GVSU PERIOD Wolters again found Ronda who ended it with her sixteenth kill PERIOD

We just had to stay aggressive Scanlon said PERIOD We play a lot of twopoint threepoint games before a practice  first side to two or first side to three  to emphasize how important those small little points are. the last five matches had not been much of a challenge for the Lakers PERIOD Prior to their loss in the second set at Findlay they had racked up  consecutive set victories PERIOD

GVSU had played in just one other fiveset match so far this season  a  loss against No PERIOD  Wayne State University Neb. at the Oredigger Classic on Sept PERIOD  in Golden Colo PERIOD  but its come a long way since then PERIOD

We struggled a little bit in Colorado but now we have these set people  weve got our groove and got our chemistry back said Wolters who finished with a gamehigh  assists to go with four kills and four digs PERIOD

Senior outside hitter Abby Aiken also turned in a strong performance with a doubledouble  kills and  digs while junior middle blocker Kaleigh Lound made a difference inside with  kills PERIOD

We just wanted to prove to ourselves that we can go five sets with tough teams push through and come out on top Wolters said PERIOD

GVSU the only undefeated team left in conference play secured the No PERIOD  seed in the GLIACGLVC Crossover Tournament with the win PERIOD

The team will clash with three opponents in the event this weekend in Aurora Ill PERIOD GVSU will play Lewis University on Friday before taking on two teams Missouri University of Science and Technology and Rockhurst University to close out the tournament on Saturday PERIOD

Were super excited for the Crossover Scanlon said PERIOD Thats an event that we look forward to every year PERIOD Everyone is going to come after us PERIOD I dont think were overconfident but we feel like were in a good place as a team PERIOD Things are coming together. oct
