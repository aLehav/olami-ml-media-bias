BridgeND  Friday October  

I was raised in a PolishCatholic household and religion was what we followed whatever the Church said was the correct way of looking at life PERIOD I only learned that gay people existed when I was  years old and my best friend had two dads PERIOD I didnt pay it any mind since her family made just as much sense to me as any other family would PERIOD If she was happy and loved what was wrong with that Five years later I came out as queer to my mother PERIOD My family tolerated my identity at first until I started dating someone who wasnt a man PERIOD They said I was brainwashed and blamed the media and leftists for my inability to be straight PERIOD As soon as I stopped dating that person my family believed me to be cured but that is not how sexuality works you cannot be cured of love PERIOD

My parents told me that my life would be over if I strayed from the norm if I fell in love with someone who wasnt a man if I wasnt heterosexual PERIOD This kind of reaction might be considered oldfashioned and absurd for Americans but it is customary and even expected for the Polish PERIOD Generations of Poles have been taught that being gay is wrong so its unsurprisingly hard for many people to step back from what theyve always known and accept an utterly different point of view PERIOD But what culture should be rooted in the hate of those who were born to love those of the same gender In Poland coming out as queer is like signing a lifelong contract to accept harassment the removal of rights and life as a propaganda target PERIOD

Using someones sexuality as a means of a political attack is a fading practice in many European countries PERIOD Still Poland has only protected the ability to destroy a gay persons career PERIOD Many conservative politicians have used antiqueer propaganda and the countrys homophobia as a weapon for political gain PERIOD Celebrity writer and broadcaster Mikolaj Milcke has been targeted whenever he returns to his hometown in Poland PERIOD His friends received countless text messages from locals asking why they werent afraid to leave their kids with him PERIOD Its not uncommon in Poland to refer to the LGBTQ community as an ideology particularly something created by the communist party PERIOD These statements have led to a lack of education on queer people in schools as well as scarlet letters for anyone who identifies as nonheterosexual PERIOD Five of Polands  provinces and over  towns and cities across the country have even branded themselves as free of LGBTQ ideology. duda ran his reelection campaign specifically on limiting gay rights saying his parents generation did not fight against communism for  years so that a new ideology would appear that is even more destructive. the minister of education has also openly called for people to stop listening to idiocy about some human rights or some equality PERIOD These queer people are not equal to normal people. as a country governed by hate Polands leaders have similar perspectives to the majority of citizens making the nation dangerous for anyone outside of the status quo PERIOD

Polish nationalism has a close relationship with the countrys religion Roman Catholicism and doesnt shy away from enacting laws based on Church doctrine PERIOD For Polish nationalists LGBTQ rights are considered part of communism which many Polish people are terrified of due to the countrys past PERIOD During their years under the Soviets the Church was the sole guardian for Poles that helped them maintain their identity and protected them from the USSR PERIOD After Poland was freed the paranoia and aftereffects remained PERIOD Even before the 1980s Polish Catholics werent as heavily targeted as Polish Jews so after World War II the Church became an establishment that stayed with Poles through every disaster PERIOD The Vatican has made blanket statements about members of the LGBTQ community regarding samesex marriage saying that God cannot bless sin which was approved by Pope Francis even though hes previously made statements supporting individuals that exhibit samesex attraction PERIOD As a conservative country devoted to the Vatican Doctrine Poland listens to what the Church values with politics and societal norms over the more ethical and practical stance PERIOD

Poland continues to be divided in politics culture and daily life but this isnt unsolvable PERIOD Making marginalized peoples equal to those who havent suffered doesnt detract from the countrys culture or tradition but instead enhances it in light of acceptance and progression PERIOD Poland is a Catholic country that values its traditions and religion but Christianity doesnt discriminate against humans because were all children of God PERIOD LGBTQ Poles deserve the same fundamental legal rights as anyone else PERIOD Ever since Ive learned what it feels like to love someone without fear in America I look forward to the day when I can do the same in my home country PERIOD
