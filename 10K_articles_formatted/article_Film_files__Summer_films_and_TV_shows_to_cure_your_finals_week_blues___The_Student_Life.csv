As the heat sets in and summer grows closer its a great time to find some new and old films and TV shows to entertain yourself in the coming weeks PERIOD Finals are soon and hopefully this list  including some of my alltime favorites  will offer you some escape and help you out if you feel like procrastinating taking a study break or finding something to look forward to after finishing your last exam PERIOD

In Y Tu Mam Tambin Alfonso Cuarn tells an intimate sexually charged story of two teenage boys taking a road trip with an older woman to a secret beach set against the backdrop of early 2000s Mexico steeped in class conflict and other types of sociopolitical turmoil PERIOD I would say that this is probably one of my favorite films of all time if not my favorite PERIOD The cinematography is stunning and the acting is some of the best Ive seen PERIOD Cuarns organic process of filmmaking allows him to construct complex characters who are shaped by both personal and national identity PERIOD In doing so he gives his viewer a realistic lens into a moment of sociopolitical tension in Mexican history PERIOD

Set during the summer in New York City High Fidelity centers on Rob Zo Kravitz the owner of a Brooklyn record store whos flailing in the aftermath of her biggest heartbreak courtesy of exfianc Mac PERIOD Desperate to figure out why shes had so much trouble with love she tracks down her exes on a quest of selfdiscovery to answer that question PERIOD The fact that this show was canceled after only one season is a crime PERIOD Zo Kravitz is totally mesmerizing as Rob PERIOD Another highlight of the show is Simon David H PERIOD Holmes Robs employee and gay exboyfriend who gets his own episode in which he relives his Top  heartbreaks PERIOD I watched this show for the first time as a senior in high school rewatching it as a sophomore in college has only deepened my love for it PERIOD Rob is a deeply flawed character and the series bares her flaws with refreshing realism making her highly relatable PERIOD Finally the soundtrack of this show curated by Questlove is one of the coolest Ive ever heard PERIOD

This film is such a comfort film of mine and holds a special place in my heart PERIOD It tracks the adventures of Texas teenagers on their last day of school in  PERIOD While the film has a stacked ensemble cast  including Matthew McConaughey Ben Affleck and more  it orbits around Randall Pink Floyd Jason London who drifts easily among stoners jocks and geeks PERIOD Pink is both a star quarterback and a stoner which presents a dilemma when his coach demands he sign a no drugs pledge PERIOD This film is unique in how it feels like a documentary as if it were literally filmed on the last day of high school in  and no one had any idea they were being filmed PERIOD Not only is the soundtrack insane but be it the hazing driving around acts of vandalism smoking weed clinking beers philosophical ramblings or hookups every moment is thoughtfully captured thanks to the fluid camera work and editing PERIOD This film shows life in high school for what it is and the loose attitudes of its characters have a genuine touch to them PERIOD Wildly entertaining Dazed and Confused is the kind of film with which you can simply sit back and live in the moment with its characters PERIOD It makes you feel a little reckless aimless and hopeful in all the right ways PERIOD

This is such a ridiculously beautiful film PERIOD Directed by Wong Karwai this Chinese film centers around a takeout express restaurant and the various individuals who cross through it PERIOD The film combines two different storylines  one that is more of a crime noir the other a romcom  both suffused with the sweltering Hong Kong heat PERIOD The characters in this film dont seem to know who they are PERIOD They wander around as loose individuals without families or homes struggling with heartbreak and desperate for lovers they can never have PERIOD Chungking Express is beautiful haunting and surprisingly funny PERIOD As this film deals with some heady complex themes I would recommend it for those looking to delve more deeply into foreign films or something slightly more challenging PERIOD

Its time for you to finally watch The Sopranos. no matter what excuses youve made in the past  or if youve somehow never heard of it  this show is more than worth the watch PERIOD This HBO series from David Chase follows the life of Tony Soprano James Gandolfini a depressed Italian mobster who begins to go to therapy PERIOD The writing and acting in this show particularly Gandolfinis performance are exquisite PERIOD In my eyes its a masterpiece PERIOD

American Honey a film that is both heartwarming and heartbreaking is also one of the most immersive Ive ever seen PERIOD While it feels a bit too long it pulls you in for the ride as it follows Star Sasha Lane a teenage girl who runs away from home with a traveling sales crew that drives across Americas heartland selling magazines doortodoor PERIOD She falls in love with Jake Shia LaBeouf and settles into the crews lifestyle of hardpartying and shirking the law PERIOD Like Dazed and Confused this film is more or less plotless and channels the liberating feeling of being young and reckless PERIOD However American Honey comes with more ragged edges PERIOD It doesnt shy away from baring the ugly side of youth of running toward an uncertain future only to find that it is no better than where you came from PERIOD

Rounding out this list is an old guilty pleasure PERIOD I grew up surfing so its possible that watching Blue Crush over and over again as a kid was not a universally relatable experience PERIOD Nevertheless this is still a fun watch with or without the nostalgia PERIOD The real draw of Blue Crush is not the acting or the script but the visuals  from Oahu beaches to insane surf shots  which make up for an overly dramatic plot line PERIOD While this film takes itself a little too seriously it sticks out as one of the few films about female surfers in a world of maledominated surf films silly dialogue and all PERIOD On a quality level the superior surfing flick is still The Endless Summer but this one is perfect if youre looking for some escapism and mindless entertainment PERIOD

Hannah Eliot SC  is from San Francisco California PERIOD She likes to surf and is on the search for more documentaries to watch PERIOD
