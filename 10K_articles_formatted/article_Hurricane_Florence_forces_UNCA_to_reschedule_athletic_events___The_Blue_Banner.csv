Hurricane Florence may not have hit Buncombe County as hard as the coast of North Carolina but the threat was enough to reschedule many of UNC Ashevilles athletic events PERIOD
The team was disappointed not to play said Frederico Santos coach of the womens volleyball team PERIOD
Womens volleyball was forced to reschedule their game against Charleston Southern University to a later date PERIOD 
The severity of Hurricane Florence caused flooding throughout North Carolina and meteorologists predicted as much as  inches of rain to hit Asheville PERIOD 
I think in these situations we all know that protecting life and being prepared for changes is very important Santos said PERIOD 
Volleyball was not the only sport that rescheduled PERIOD Mens soccer was moved from Sept PERIOD  to Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Mens tennis could not compete in the University of South Carolina Upstate fall tournament PERIOD Womens golf was originally going to play in the Pirate Intercollegiate but are now playing at the MSU Greenbrier Invitational in Kentucky PERIOD 
Our tournament at ECU was canceled said Ericka Schneider coach of the womens golf team PERIOD We were able to get into another event right away to take place of the canceled one. despite the news of Hurricane Florences path toward Asheville Santos didnt change his practice schedule PERIOD
The team prepared as if we were going to play Santos said PERIOD They worked hard all week until we received news of cancelation. mens soccer coach Mathes Mennell commended his team on how they adapted to the conditions PERIOD
I thought our players did an excellent job of being flexible and understanding that this was out of control Mennell said PERIOD
Santos recognized that in both sports and life conflicts can and will happen PERIOD
In life as in sports changes can happen quickly so we must be flexible and calm to analyze the situation and then take action. santos said PERIOD
Athletes get used to a certain rhythm when it comes to preparing for a game according to Mennell but the Bulldogs handled the transition with grace PERIOD
Athletes are creatures of habit but I thought our guys did a great job of realizing this was an extreme situation and adjusting Mennell said PERIOD
Mens soccer being pushed from Sunday to Tuesday gave them more time to prepare for the game but Mennell knows that more preparation time can be dangerous PERIOD
They were probably a little bit more prepared PERIOD The danger in that is when you set your schedule you try to maximize rest because there are so many games in a college soccer season Mennell said PERIOD I think they did a pretty good job. some teams like the womens golf team were ready to go out and play PERIOD
It didnt really affect their readiness to play Schneider said PERIOD They are fairly used to playing in inclement weather due to it being an outdoor sport. hurricane Florence has continued to have an impact on North Carolina PERIOD According to WFMY News Hurricane Florence caused  deaths in North Carolina and put approximately  citizens in emergency shelters PERIOD 
We have some guys that have family out on the coast so that weighed on them a little bit Mennell said PERIOD Their families were safe and they were able to ride out the storm. by the time the hurricane reached Asheville it had been downgraded to a tropical storm PERIOD
Thankfully we did not get much bad weather here in Asheville Mennell said PERIOD
Mennell thinks the rescheduling was done well PERIOD
I thought the rescheduling was pretty seamless and thats always a good thing Mennell said PERIOD
