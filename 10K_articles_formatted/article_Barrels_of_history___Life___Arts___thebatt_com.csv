While trying four different wines two reds and two whites tourgoers are taught the five steps in properly tasting wine  sight swirl smellsip and savor PERIOD

After spending an hour and a half at the flagship Messina Hof winery in Bryan I learned about the ins and outs of grape growing and winemaking PERIOD But perhaps most importantly I learned Messina Hof gives its visitors the celebrity feel of a professional winery at an affordable price PERIOD

The first thing I used to think of when I thought of a vineyard or winery was the cost associated with them PERIOD I mean expensive bottles of wine can be hundreds of dollars and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie had their wedding at a winery in France PERIOD For a while I held onto this idea that winemaking and vineyards were experiences only attainable for wealthy people and celebrities PERIOD However Cameron Ciemiewicz the tasting room manager at Messina Hof said he wants everyone in Aggieland to know that a good experience at a winery doesnt have to be expensive PERIOD

In wine culture there is this history of itbeing saved only for people who were on the more wealthy side Ciemiewicz said PERIOD There has been a shift now it is a lot more accessible and people of all backgrounds can enjoy wine PERIOD It doesnt have to be this pretentious thing anymore and we can enjoy it as a community together. known as Texas most awardwinningwinery Messina Hof could easily be a goto for only the areas most elite PERIOD Despite this Messina Hofs humble beginnings have influenced its growth PERIOD Planting their first vineyard in  on a oneacre plot in Bryan Paul and Merrill Bonarrigo started a family tradition that would pioneer the growth of the Texas wine industry PERIOD

The familyowned business began getting attention from neighbors shortly after its inception beginning Messina Hofs work in hospitality and accessibility for the Brazos Valley community PERIOD

People shouldnt feel intimidated coming here for the first time Ciemiewicz said PERIOD The reason we are here is to teach and guide people to making good decisions about wine PERIOD We look to educate people in an approachable way so dont worry about coming here without knowledge of wine PERIOD We welcome all levels of wine knowledge and that wont change anytime soon. for  I booked my tasting tour at Messina Hofs location in Bryan and was given not only a taste of the winerys history but a taste of several of their most popular wines and a complimentary wine glass PERIOD Now Ill admit Ive never been much of a wine person PERIOD Walking through the aisles of HEB and seeing the hundreds of different wine options always seemed intimidating so I typically opted for something else who am I kidding its White Claw PERIOD After spending an afternoon with Ciemiewicz however my outlook on wine was changed and I even bought a  bottle of Riesling as I left PERIOD

The familyowned feel of Messina Hofand Ciemiewiczs passion for teaching aboutwine made me feel like I was on an adult field trip and I would definitely compare my experience to my trips to the zoo as a child PERIOD I recommend Messina Hof for anyone looking for an interesting and affordable experience  they have tours and lowcost bottles as well as a restaurant and a bed and breakfast PERIOD For a grand total of only  I got a tour of one of Texas finest wineries a bottle of wine a complimentary wine glass and a newfound appreciation of wine that will last a lifetime PERIOD
