9039,2023-11-04,"isc giveth and the disc taketh away PERIOD In a sport determined by the travel of a 175gram piece of plastic sometimes all the practice in the world cant prepare an ultimate frisbee team for what Mother Nature brings to the table PERIOD

Such was the case for the three Carleton squads that competed in last weekends North Central DI Regional Championships held on the blustery plains of Madison Wis PERIOD With  mph winds persisting through both days of competition teams had to learn how to battle the elements as well as their foes as they fought for bids to the National Championships to be held in Boulder Colo PERIOD ninth weekend PERIOD

Things turned out favorably for Syzygy which surged to a secondplace finish and nationals berth but CUT and GoP experienced the other side of the windblown coin PERIOD CUT managed to hold onto one of four bids but a tough Sunday left the team finishing third while GoP struggled against the elements and finished in the middle of the pack PERIOD



The stakes were high for Syzygy as the top three finishers in womens play would advance to Nationals and everyone elses season would be over PERIOD The top four teams in the tournament  Iowa Iowa State WisconsinMadison and Carleton  were all national contenders with a legitimate shot at the title Wisconsin was two points away from playing in the national title game last year Iowa was ranked fourth nationally this year Iowa State beat Iowa two weeks ago at Conferences and Syzygy had beaten each of those teams at least once this year PERIOD

Saturday was devoted to pool play. despite having to fish the disc out of a nearby lake at least once due to wind gusting above  mph Syzygy took care of business in its first two games beating Nebraska and Wisconsin in a game in which neither team could score upwind before losing to Iowa PERIOD Quarterfinals against Minnesota featured several exciting upwind breaks a disc lost in the lake and a  victory for the good guys PERIOD

Sunday started with semifinals pitting Syzygy against Iowa State. the winner of this game would automatically qualify for Nationals while the loser would have to play two mustwin games in order to qualify. syzygy came out on fire scoring the first six points on the way to a dominating  win PERIOD In the finals Iowa beat Syzygy again this time  in a frustrating game PERIOD Syzygy slept well that night though dreaming of Nationals in Boulder ninth Weekend PERIOD

It was a disappointing Regional Championship for the twotime defending champions CUT as the one seed dropped to a third place finish behind Wisconsin and Iowa PERIOD Luckily for CUT the North Central Region had four bids to Nationals so the season did not end this weekend PERIOD The weekend was truly a tale of two days PERIOD On Saturday CUT took care of business winning its pool by defeating both MinnesotaDuluth and WisconsinMilwaukee with scores of  PERIOD This placed CUT in the semifinals against Iowa IHUC PERIOD The conditions were extremely windy but CUT came out focused and was able to run off enough upwind breaks to take Iowa  PERIOD With the semifinal victory CUT clinched one of the four births to Nationals PERIOD

Sunday was less successful PERIOD In the finals against the Wisconsin Hodags CUT came out flat and got stuck in a big hole PERIOD Wisconsin took the first half  one of CUTs worst halves in recent memory PERIOD Despite the setback CUT fought back but time ran out on them and they ended up loosing  PERIOD This set up another match against Iowa to determine second and third place for seeding purposes PERIOD Again the conditions were incredibly windy and CUT did not have the answers to Iowas zone or intensity PERIOD Iowa would end up taking the game by a score of  PERIOD

This was CUTs worst finish at Regionals in at least a decade and the two losses from the weekend are just one short of CUTs total number of losses for the entire season coming into the weekend PERIOD The loss will also create some interesting seeding for Nationals as CUT must now be seeded behind Iowa meaning CUT will likely be seeded somewhere in the  range instead of the topfive seed they almost surely would have secured had they finished first or second in the Region PERIOD Luckily CUT lives to fight another day and hopes to take the lessons learned from this weekend into Nationals PERIOD

The windswept fields of Madisons Stoner Prairie Elementary saw the Gods of Plastics season come to a difficult end as GoP was unable to overcome windinduced mistakes going  on the weekend PERIOD Saturday pool play started promisingly with the Gods sweeping past NebraskaOmaha  but the momentum stopped in the ensuing game with Iowa State PERIOD The glare off of an ISUC handlers sunglasses must have blinded GoP out of focus as the Gods struggled to convert in the red zone and fell  PERIOD Licking its wounds GoP played a hard fun game against eventual regional champion Wisconsin PERIOD Out of compassion for GoP alum and current Hodag Eric Alexander the Gods chose not to derail Wisconsins unblemished weekend as the Hodags pulled away  PERIOD GoP salvaged the day with a win over beloved rival St PERIOD Olaf overcoming a late Ole upwind break that nearly gave the team an excuse to drown its sorrows at Mifflin that evening PERIOD

Instead Americas ATeam remained in contention for the final bid to nationals at least for one more evening PERIOD Sunday was May Day but there would be no victory flowers for GoP the day proving to be a different kind of mayday as the teams flight through  came crashing to a halt PERIOD Squaring off with UWEau Claire on another blustery morning the teams traded shots early until a UWEC upwind break before halftime proved the difference PERIOD Unable to conquer the prairie winds against aptly named Eauzones tight defense GoP watched its season slip painfully away to the tune of a  defeat PERIOD

In true GoP fashion however the team would not let the loss entirely dampen its spirits PERIOD After a lighthearted consolation contest with UWMilwaukee GoP turned its efforts to its other primary purpose heckling opponents of CUT PERIOD With Pete Rogers  leading the way the Gods provided a boisterous accompaniment to the tournaments championship game proving that while Mother Nature may be able to derail onfield performance when it comes to unity and heart Carleton College really is the best PERIOD
