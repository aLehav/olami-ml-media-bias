What have you done lately to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions

That might not be a question you ask yourself every day but it probably should be PERIOD Al Gores testimony before Congress on global warming last week got me thinking about the urgency of using less energy in our lives PERIOD I know the issue of whether greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for rising global temperatures is hotly debated but I have to say Im with Al on this one PERIOD

I think theres enough evidence out there to show that if we continue to live the way we do our planet could experience extreme weather conditions that will only bring about havoc and destruction PERIOD We all contribute to global warming without even realizing it by doing everyday things like driving cars using computers and running the dishwasher PERIOD

Lets face it PERIOD We are a society completely dependent on harmful energy consumption but its not too late to change our ways and help reduce the effects of global warming PERIOD

You are probably wondering how you as an individual can do this PERIOD

The answer may be easier than you think PERIOD

A visit to www.climatecrisis.net the official Web site of Gores An Inconvenient Truth provided me with a multitude of ways we can cut down on energy consumption by making slight changes in our lives PERIOD

Some of these tips are easy enough for even the average college student to follow so let me share them with you PERIOD

You probably know that you should turn off electronics when youre not using them to save energy PERIOD

But did you know that things like hairdryers TVs and cell phone chargers still use energy when plugged into the wall

I didnt PERIOD I dont even want to think about how many times Ive kept my cell phone charger plugged into my wall when I wasnt using it but now Ill be sure to keep it unplugged PERIOD

And heres an extra incentive for unplugging those electronics  you wont just be saving energy but you could save money on your electric bill PERIOD

Another great way to cut down on energy is by using less hot water PERIOD I know we all love hot showers so a great way to use less hot water is by installing a lowflow showerhead PERIOD Doing so could save  pounds of carbon dioxide per year PERIOD

You can also use less hot water by washing your clothes in cold or warm water PERIOD This could save  pounds of carbon dioxide per year PERIOD

And next time you go food shopping keep these ideas in mind PERIOD Try to buy fresh food instead of frozen when you can because frozen food requires  times more energy to produce PERIOD Eating less beef is also a great way to reduce the effects of global warming PERIOD I know were all excited that McDonalds just reopened downtown but did you know that cows are one of the greatest emitters of methane and that methane is a major greenhouse gas Yep because cows eat so much grass and have multiple stomachs they exhale methane with every breath PERIOD

Now lets talk about cars PERIOD Sure they make it easy to get around but we should try to reduce the number of miles we drive PERIOD Walking biking carpooling and taking forms of public transportation like buses or trains are great alternatives PERIOD

In fact cutting down on driving by just  miles each week would eliminate about  pounds of carbon dioxide emissions a year PERIOD

And speaking of cars its a good idea to check your tires each week to make sure they are properly inflated because it could improve gas mileage by more than  percent PERIOD Every gallon of gasoline saved keeps  pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere PERIOD

And Ill leave you with one more tip PERIOD With spring finally here its time to go out and plant a tree PERIOD A single tree will absorb about a ton of carbon dioxide in its lifetime PERIOD I guess they dont say  for nothing PERIOD

Global warming may be a worldwide problem but every individual can help minimize the effects by reducing their energy consumption PERIOD

Dont doubt the impact you have PERIOD

When it comes to global warming little things can make a big difference PERIOD
