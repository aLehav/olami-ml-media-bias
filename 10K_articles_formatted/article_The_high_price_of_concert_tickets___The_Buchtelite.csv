There is nothing better than attending your favorite band or artists concert PERIOD Theres nothing quite like the energy in a soldout venue or the excitement of hearing your favorite songs played live PERIOD

But what once was a fun and thrilling way to spend an evening has now been turned into an expensive endeavor PERIOD

The prices of concert tickets are outrageous nowadays PERIOD Depending on the artist or band the venue and the section fans choose to sit in concert goers can end up paying an arm and a leg for tickets PERIOD

In fact according to an ABC News article at the beginning of the year the average price of a concert ticket had risen . percent since  becoming on average . per ticket PERIOD

Ticket prices were so high this summer that Forbes released a list of the most expensive summer concerts PERIOD If fans wanted to see Beyonc One Direction Taylor Swift or Pink they had to shell out quite a bit of money to do so PERIOD

One Direction topped the list their average ticket price being . pERIOD Just imagine how many hours of chores tweens had to do to cough up . for a single ticket PERIOD

According to the article Three of One Directions shows have an average price of over  and nine have an average price above . needless to say the British boy band made a killing off of parents who spoiled their children this summer PERIOD

As far as U.S PERIOD concerts go Beyonc had the most expensive ticket prices the average ticket costing . pERIOD Compared to One Direction the price doesnt seem so steep but it was still way too much money for an evening with Mrs PERIOD Carter PERIOD

It seems like the days of attending your favorite artist and bands concerts are a thing of the past PERIOD

Even if you arent shelling out  per ticket you still have to pay at least  to get decent seats PERIOD When it comes to artists like Beyonc Justin Timberlake Taylor Swift and Drake concert goers are lucky if they can even afford any type of ticketat all PERIOD

Honestly though we can only really blame ourselves for the high cost of concert tickets PERIOD With the ability to illegally download music not as many people are buying albums anymore PERIOD This believe it or not actually does hurt the music industry PERIOD

According to the Rolling Stones At the end of July U.S PERIOD albums sold just . million copies the lowest weekly total since Nielsen SoundScan began keeping track in  and for the first time ever labels sold fewer than  million albums in each of five straight weeks. because of these low sales artists and record labels had to raise the price of their tickets in order to make up for the loss PERIOD And how can we really blame them

If you think about it it really is a great business strategy PERIOD Labels and artists can now make a killing from just one sold out show let alone a tour full of them PERIOD

With the increase in prices the only solution for concert goers is to pick and choose which concerts they attend and save up the money to get awesome seats PERIOD After all a night with your favorite artist can be well worth the money PERIOD
