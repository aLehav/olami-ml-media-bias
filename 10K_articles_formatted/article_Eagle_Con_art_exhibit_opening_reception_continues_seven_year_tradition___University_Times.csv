Some of his notable projects are Star WarsThe Force Awakens Back to the Future Part II and Jurassic Park. the Art Directors Guild is our founding sponsor and they put a lot of time resources and love into this event so that students at Cal State LA have direct contact with some of the top professionals who work in Hollywood said Patrick Sharp faculty director of EagleCon PERIOD Its important for students to be persistent to get their foot in the door and keep going at it. the exhibit also served as an avenue to mixandmingle with industry professionals PERIOD The idea that we can actually talk to somebody who worked with James Cameron or Steven Spielberg is really fascinating said liberal studies major Luis Garcia PERIOD Getting to pick their brains and to learn how it is to work with directors of that magnitude is cool. mimi Gramatky the first female president of the Art Directors Guild has been sponsoring EagleCon for the last five years PERIOD Gramatky expressed to the UT how pleased she was with the interactions between the oldies and the newbies at the event PERIOD We have so much fun together its just delicious she said PERIOD

When asked about the large turnout and discussions amongst professionals and students Gramatky said

Its fabulous PERIOD This year in particular we seem to have finally gotten a lot of people to participate PERIOD Its so exciting I love it I cant say enough about it. students like liberal studies major Ruben Rodriguez loved the intimacy and amount of access they had when networking PERIOD

Its a much more personal experience unlike anywhere else said Rodriguez PERIOD If you have questions you are more likely to ask them because some conventions are too big and that discourages participation it makes me want to attend EagleCon even more. additionally many saw it as a precursor as whats to come and expected in Hollywood PERIOD Its a great opportunity to show what the expectations are in what were trying to do as creatives this exhibit is a perfect example and inspiration to us trying to get into the film industry said Garcia PERIOD

Friday EagleCons focus shifts to workshops and panels led by Hollywood veterans while Saturday the convention will be packed with more activities throughout the day such as comic book drawing exercises a student film festival and board game competitions PERIOD

Sharp explained Our big focus is actually getting professionals to campus in greater numbers and try to have more professionalization workshops for our students. eagleCon continues through Friday and Saturday filled with panels and activities in the University Student Union PERIOD
