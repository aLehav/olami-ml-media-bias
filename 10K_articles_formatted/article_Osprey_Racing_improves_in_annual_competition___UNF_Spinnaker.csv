Osprey Racing earned their highest finish in six years of competing at the Society of Automotive Engineers International competition placing forty-eighth out of  teams in the competition PERIOD

Each year Osprey Racing has to build a brand new car this years iteration was called the Swoop D6 from scratch PERIOD The car must be ready by the date of the competition This in itself is a huge task as  schools couldnt compete because they didnt have their car ready in time PERIOD

Other Florida universities competing against UNF annually are the University of Florida University of Central Florida Florida Atlantic University and University of South Florida PERIOD This year UNF beat UCF Florida Institute of Technology and USF PERIOD

The racing team has participated in the Formula SAE competition for five years PERIOD In  the team placed sixtieth and in  they placed one hundred and second PERIOD

The goal from here on out from the Osprey Racing team is to be part of the top20 teams at the competition stated Austin Hindman a Mechanical Engineering Junior PERIOD

The competition consists of two sections static and dynamic evaluations PERIOD The dynamic section of the competition evaluates the speed and the endurance of the car while the static section evaluates the design and the production behind the car PERIOD There are also eight subscores that are totaled over the period of the competition PERIOD

I think we had a really good car this year it pretty well in the dynamic events said Albin Alex a Mechanical Engineering Junior and Vice President of the club PERIOD So next year we will be focusing on the static events and basically working on the design event the cost the business that aspect of the club which we didnt do so well this year. the team has already started on the design for next years car and will be inspired by this years car PERIOD
