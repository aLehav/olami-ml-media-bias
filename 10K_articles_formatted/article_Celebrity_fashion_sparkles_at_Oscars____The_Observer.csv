Kelly OSullivan  Tuesday February  

Although the Academy Awards would not have taken place without the great films of the past year the fashions on the Red Carpet drew a large number of viewers before any statuettes were handed out PERIOD Whether audiences hoped to see elegant gowns or wanted to mock a fashion faux pas in real time this years preOscars festivities did not disappoint PERIOD

There were several standouts in the early evening festivities Cameron Diaz wore a pale pink Dior gown with clean architectural folds that fell into a nicely draped body and skirt while Jennifer Garners Oscar de la Renta was another interesting design PERIOD Strapless at the top and fitted through the thigh the gown featured a unique texture with layers of black material that fell into larger ruffles at the bottom PERIOD

Kelly Preston strolled by the paparazzi on John Travoltas arm in a gown featuring a recently popular silhouette PERIOD What set Prestons look apart was the fresh and interesting marigold shade by Roberto Cavalli PERIOD Pregnant beauties Jessica Alba and Cate Blanchett glowed in richly colored gowns by Marchesa and Dries van Noten respectively PERIOD

True to its name the Red Carpet featured several dresses of the same color PERIOD Teen pop sensation Miley Cyrus wore an elegant ageappropriate Valentino gown PERIOD Reminiscent of Old Hollywood glamour Katherine Heigl showed off a vintageinspired Escada gown with an equally fitting hairstyle PERIOD The always classy Helen Mirren touted a deeply colored Georges Chakra gown with stunning Swarovski crystal sleeves PERIOD

Also in crimson Heidi Klums bold John Galliano gown was auctioned off after the big night to benefit The Heart Truth an organization founded by the National Institute of Health to promote awareness of women and heart disease throughout the country PERIOD The red dress is the national symbol of women and heart disease awareness and Klum began her help promoting the cause when she wore a red Marc Jacobs creation on National Wear Red Day at the recent MercedesBenz Fashion Week PERIOD

The most debateinspiring gown on the Red Carpet was certainly French actress Marion Cotillards mermaidesque gown by Jean Paul Gaultier PERIOD However even skeptics of the design could not deny Cotillards beauty when she stepped forward to accept her Oscar for Leading Actress for her role in La Vie en Rose. one of the biggest misses of the night was Tilda Swintons shapeless and overly modest black washed silksatin Lanvin gown that perplexed many PERIOD Rebecca Miller wife of Daniel Day Lewis topped the worst dressed list along with Swinton PERIOD Millers black frock featured large black gems on the bust and red ribbon bows as straps along with long sleeves that appeared below her bare shoulders PERIOD

Further confusing the evenings audience were the simple shoes that Diablo Cody showed off to photographers PERIOD Cody was scheduled to wear a pair of milliondollar metallic Tstrap heels designed by Stuart Weitzman that featured roses of Kwiat diamonds PERIOD In the days leading up to the ceremony the writer of Indie film Juno had made known her disappointment at being used as a stunt to publicize the shoes PERIOD

Despite the few exceptions the ladies of Hollywood cleaned up nicely for the industrys most important night PERIOD However even those gowns that impressed viewers the most still lacked a certain something that memorable gowns in recent years had brought to the table PERIOD Loyal Red Carpet fans will certainly be waiting for more noteworthy looks from both the best and worst dressed at next years event PERIOD
