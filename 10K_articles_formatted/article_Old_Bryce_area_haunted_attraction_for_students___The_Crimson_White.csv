The unofficial term Old Bryce refers to a pair of abandoned buildings in a rural area of Northport that served as early establishments in the history of mental health in the state of Alabama PERIOD The S.D PERIOD Allen Intermediate Care Facility was open from  to  to serve patients older than  years old said Jeff Shackelford the public information officer for the Department of Mental Health PERIOD

Shackelford said the second building known as the Jemison building served as a dormitory for highfunctioning patients of the Partlow Developmental Center in Tuscaloosa PERIOD The last patients of the facility were served in the 1970s he said PERIOD

It is welldocumented that the conditions at the Jemison building were not good at the time Shackelford said referring to the landmark Wyatt v PERIOD Stickney lawsuit that stretched from  to  PERIOD The case brought the atrocities of the mental health system of the state to light PERIOD Eventually it was decided that patients had the right to appropriate care and led to the switch from state institutions to communitybased care PERIOD

Shackelford referred to a description of the Jemison building from journalist Paul Davis in The Tuscaloosa News in  PERIOD Davis wrote Human feces were caked on the toilets and walls urine saturated the aging oak floors many beds lacked linen some patients slept on floors PERIOD Archaic shower stalls had cracked and spewing shower heads PERIOD One tiny shower closet served  male patients the  women patients also had but one shower PERIOD Most of the patients at Jemison were highly tranquilized and had not been bathed in days PERIOD All appeared to lack any semblance of treatment PERIOD The stench was almost unbearable. today the Jemison building is dilapidated and painted with graffiti PERIOD Rumors circle among Tuscaloosa citizens that the buildings that comprise Old Bryce are now haunted PERIOD

I had a distant relative in it and I know some of the ways they treated the patients were horrific said Katie Fogg a junior majoring in electrical engineering who has explored the area twice PERIOD Rumor has it its haunted. however the haunting only propels student activity PERIOD

We parked behind an abandoned church and then walked a quarter mile in the woods said Roberts who on her third trip explored the basement and third floor of the Jemison building PERIOD Police are out there a lot on weekends and around Halloween. it was a combination of knowing what went on there combined with the thought of getting caught that made it so scary Fogg said PERIOD
