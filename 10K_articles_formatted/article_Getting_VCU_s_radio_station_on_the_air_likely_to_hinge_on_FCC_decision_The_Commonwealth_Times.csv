Time work and money will be the keys for a WVCW studentoperated FM radio station PERIOD The station now broadcasts online through its Web site PERIOD

Greg Weatherford student media director said several changes would have to be made for WVCW to gain an FM frequency even though he thinks it possibly could occur within a couple of years PERIOD

First of course the FCC Federal Communications Commission has to grant space on the spectrum and to create a station would be good for the community he said PERIOD The federal government controls broadcast so they get to say whether or not we can do it PERIOD So it would certainly be no less than a couple of years. i think by going FM you would be much more available to the entire community rather than simply to people who know to dial in to the Web site. greg Weatherford student media director

Bill Wright general manager for WVCW concurred with that opinion saying with the proper support and adequate funding an FM frequency could be possible within the next few years PERIOD

I would think that we should be able to get an FM frequency providing the administration is behind us the students are behind us and the funds are there Wright said PERIOD I would think in the next five years. weatherford said for WVCW to obtain an FM slot on the dial the FCC would have to approve the frequency and a tower would be needed PERIOD  In addition it would need special permits and additional funds PERIOD

That takes a lot of work as far as getting permits locally he said PERIOD  If its in the city limits which I will assume it will be well have to get building permits approved PERIOD

I think the money can be found out PERIOD I think weve got some money in the system for the amount that would be required. the student media director referred to the FCC as playing the most important role in gaining an FM frequency PERIOD

The biggest step he said and the most complicated and long drawn out one and the most expensive is probably going to be getting through the FCC. funds for the FM frequency he said would come from the Student Media Commission PERIOD

Right now the radio station is funded through the Student Media Commission not through SGA at all Weatherford said PERIOD And we are operating under the assumption that thats how were going to continue. wright said he too thinks a frequency would be the next stage for the WVCW station PERIOD

The next step would be to go either AM or FM Wright said PERIOD But it would be lowpower AM or it would be FM which is a big difference from regular AM and FM. jason Kenney a disc jockey and assistant general manager of the studentoperated station said WVCW should have an FM frequency because most other schools in Virginia have one or they have a broadcast station and it is something that the students should expect to have PERIOD

I think its just a natural progression Kenney said adding that it not only would raise the station a notch but it also would enhance the reputation of the school and its mass communications area PERIOD

Weatherford said by WCVW gaining an FM frequency it could be heard by more people PERIOD

What we have now is on the Internet Weatherford said PERIOD And its an excellently run station and I think its actually a very strong alternative college rock station PERIOD

But I think by going FM you would be much more available to the entire community rather than simply to people who know to dial in to the Web site. robert Fleskes marketing director for the Richmond Coliseum and faculty adviser for WVCW agreed with Weatherfords reasoning for the frequency PERIOD

The obvious reason More people would actually hear the station Fleskes said because its audience now is limited PERIOD Listenership is the main reason behind it. in regards to the community Fleskes sees the value an FM frequency would provide for commuter students PERIOD Moreover he predicted that much VCU pride would come with an FM frequency because it would be something students can call their own PERIOD

It serves both purposes to entertain and inform Fleskes said PERIOD

Wright agreed with both Weatherford and Fleskes PERIOD

I think it would just be more accessible to everybody Wright said PERIOD You know right now were doing the best that we can by putting it on the Internet and having it available for the students who all have Internet in their dorms PERIOD But this would allow them to have it outside of the dorms. if a lowpower frequency were used he said the station could only be heard locally PERIOD

I know a lot of people are talking about having it in their cars but if we went low power the broadcast range would probably be about three miles from the antenna Wright said PERIOD So you could get it if you were living around Richmond or driving around PERIOD But if youre a commuter student from Goochland youre probably not going to hear it. additionally Kenney said an FM frequency would provide practical experience for broadcast students as well as production work PERIOD

I think it just opens up a lot more opportunities for students to be able to practice in a professional environment for something that they may want to do careerwise Kenney  said PERIOD

WVCWS staff already decides the programming but an FM station also could produce live news sports and talk shows PERIOD

VCUrelated information of any kind could be available Weatherford said PERIOD

Wright said the current programming heard now would be aired on the FM frequency too PERIOD

We run off of CMJ format which is the College Music Journal he said PERIOD We also have specialty shows ranging from rap to electronic to country to jazz PERIOD We have some talk shows. wright recently met with John Michelli SGA director of student affairs to discuss the FM frequency while Michelli said he met with Wright to learn more about WVCW PERIOD

There was a bill that came to the Senate Michelli said in support of an FM station for VCU and I didnt know a lot about the subject so I went to them to get filled in. michelli also said that the purpose of the SGAs FM frequency bill is to provide student support for the station to the administration PERIOD

What they want from the SGA Michelli said is a bill saying that the SGA supports an FM station essentially saying the student body supports and would like an FM station PERIOD

So that if they ever go to the administration and the administration ever says Well do the students want this they can say Well I have a resolution right here that says the students do want it and you know case closed PERIOD So thats really all they want from the SGA. wright said that WVCW wants the students support PERIOD

Its nice to know that if this bill passes that just lets us know that the student body is behind it Wright said PERIOD
