Israels Genocidal War in Gaza What You Need to Know

Open Letter to former Macalester President Brian Rosenberg

At its core the Midway Murals project is only four walls and one man in the Hamline Midway neighborhood of Saint Paul PERIOD Its goals including economic development community engagement and bridging divides between immigrants and nonimmigrant community members are as ambitious as the projects leader neighborhood resident Jonathan Oppenheimer PERIOD

Funded by the John S PERIOD and James L PERIOD Knight Foundation neighborhood partners and a recently completed successful campaign on the crowdsourcing site Indiegogo Oppenheimer wants to flip the common indifferent perception many Minnesotans have of the neighborhood on its head by transforming this halfmile stretch of Snelling Avenue with four massive murals PERIOD

With over  vehicles using it every day Snelling is one of the most frequented roads in Minnesota PERIOD However the HamlineMidway neighborhood nestled around Snelling just a five minute drive from Macalesters campus remains largely unseen PERIOD Unlike the areas surrounding Selby and Grand Avenues high traffic has not brought streams of customers or investments to the Hamline Midway community PERIOD The reason is simple driving through many people cannot look past the graffitiriddled and aging appearance of the street PERIOD Midway Murals hopes to serve as a reason to notice all that this community has to offer both for people outside and within its perimeters PERIOD

I was really excited when they reached out to me last fall about the idea says Councilmember Russ Stark whose district includes the Hamline Midway neighborhood PERIOD I think its a really great way to bring a little bit of life and color and interest back to a stretch of Snelling that is looking a little old and tired right now. oppenheimer has commissioned four public artists to collaborate with business owners and the Hamline Midway neighborhood to design and implement four murals on the outside faades of four immigrantowned businesses PERIOD Community listening sessions and business open houses to determine what the community wants represented in the murals are still underway PERIOD However one thing is certain each artist will create separate murals in July and August  that is centered around the theme of starting anew. using a variety of techniques and mediums Lori Green Greta McLain Eric Mattheis and Yuya Negishis murals will aim to reflect the continuously changing face of both the neighborhood and its surrounding city creating an outdoor museum worthy of if nothing else being noticed PERIOD The diverse artists all host impressive professional accolades PERIOD They are considered by many appreciators of the Twin Cities public art world to be representative of what the scene is all about PERIOD

The artists that Im working with are awesome Oppenheimer says revealing a broad grin PERIOD And I dont say that lightly PERIOD I really respect them so much PERIOD Weve all become good friends in the last six months. in the HamlineMidway neighborhood many residents recognize a fairly palpable divide between many of the immigrantowned businesses and the largely nonimmigrant residential community PERIOD Stark says Theres a perception that some of the immigrantowned grocery stores and cafes are primarily there to serve the East African community and that theyre just there and relatively ignored by the neighbors. this perception coupled with Oppenheimers now close relationships with numerous immigrant business owners is one of the key motivating forces behind the project PERIOD

Oppenheimer openly addresses his trepidations of not having any official training in public art creative spacemaking bridging cultural divides or working with immigrant communities PERIOD Instead he is relying on his real world experience and reaching out to those who are experts in these fields soaking up as much as he can to achieve the most success PERIOD While he recognizes the asset of his communityinsider identity he is quick to point out that organizing a project like this which hopes to engage an incredibly diverse community is just not that simple PERIOD

In working with immigrant communities I am still an outsider Oppenheimer says openly PERIOD His optimism and tenacity however would never let him stop there PERIOD The complexity of doing this stuff is part of why it scares me but its also really exciting because its what I believe in and its what Im trying to do. with initiative and ingenuity like his it isnt not hard to believe that what hes trying to do will soon become a reality PERIOD The public planning process will continue over the course of five future community listening sessions and open houses to discuss the future of both the project and the wider Hamline Midway neighborhood PERIOD For Mac students who are sticking around the area for the summer there will be a grand unveiling celebration towards the end of August PERIOD More information about the project and its longterm goals is online at MidwayMurals.com PERIOD
