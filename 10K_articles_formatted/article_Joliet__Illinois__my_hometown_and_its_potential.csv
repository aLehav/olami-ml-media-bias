Ive always been proud of being from Joliet Ill PERIOD Before moving to Ann Arbor I had never lived anywhere else PERIOD Like my parents I was born and raised in Joliet PERIOD I grew up moving from neighborhood to neighborhood  but always within the citys boundaries PERIOD From the St PERIOD Pats area to the Glenwood Manor subdivision the diversity and beauty of my city make me proud to be from what others may believe is an irrelevant suburb of Chicago PERIOD

Situated  minutes southwest of the Windy City Joliet is a socioeconomically and racially diverse area PERIOD Almost half of the population is white while around onethird of the population is Hispanic and the remaining is predominantly Black PERIOD I would describe Joliet to be a middleclass mix of professionals and bluecollar lowincome workers with a median household income slightly above the national median of  PERIOD Growing up in this environment was very crucial in shaping my values what I want in life and who I am PERIOD My lovehate relationship with Joliet has been a constant backandforth my entire life PERIOD

For part of elementary school I attended St PERIOD Patricks Catholic School right down the street from my house PERIOD This was my first introduction to the different dynamics of Joliet which I discovered is a relatively religious city with a Catholic presence PERIOD Since school was mainly white and my neighborhood mainly Hispanic it seemed that white and Hispanic Catholics made up a majority of the city and that the church was important to the Joliet community and its people PERIOD What I knew of Joliet during this time existed within a bubble  a secluded white bubble that did not accurately represent the city PERIOD I was learning in a predominantly white school a school that didnt encompass the other ethnic communities PERIOD It wasnt until middle school when I got a stronger sense of the diversity Joliet has to offer PERIOD

After leaving elementary school I went to Hufford Junior High School a public school only about four minutes away from my house PERIOD Hufford was a drastic change in environment compared to St PERIOD Pats PERIOD Now attending a majority Hispanic school with almost a quarter of its students Black and only about  of the student population being white I was finally given a more diverse view of what my city actually looked like PERIOD Socioeconomically too  of the students came from lowincome families PERIOD I was placed in a diverse environment of social and economic intersections surrounded by many other Hispanic and Black students PERIOD Because I was surrounded by such a diverse group of students Hufford was my first introduction to the systemic poverty Joliet faces along with the subsequent stigmas surrounding my home PERIOD

Hufford was often referred to as the ghetto school by other students in middle schools only  minutes away PERIOD Despite only being preteens my Hufford community was forced to deal with racist and classist stereotypes that inevitably affect young childrens perceptions of themselves PERIOD Other middle schoolers who still lived in Joliet were judging Hufford students for simply not being as wealthy and thus not having the support such as lower studentteacher ratios and higher teacher retention rates that the nonHufford students enjoyed PERIOD Going to Hufford kickstarted my internalized shame over living in Joliet PERIOD I didnt interact much with the students who said these things about my school and city so it was only in high school that I began to truly battle with my lovehate relationship with Joliet PERIOD

The resurgence of white students into my life started at Joliet West High School also only three minutes away from my home PERIOD Though my high school was still very diverse most of my freshman year classes had a disproportionate amount of white students PERIOD Most of these students came from the middle school that was  minutes away Troy Middle School PERIOD

Despite going to the same high school students would and still do to this day make sure that others knew they went to Troy trying to distance themselves from Joliet as much as possible PERIOD Many of these students were also from the neighboring Shorewood Ill. a village with a population that is over  white with a median household income almost  greater than the national median PERIOD Due to this issues of race and class became an internalized problem for me PERIOD I didnt want to be associated with Joliet  I didnt want to be seen as poor or ghetto. many students shared this same perception and it seemed as if we collectively wanted to leave Joliet and never come back PERIOD Whenever Im scrolling through Twitter I always see people from back home wanting to escape the city describing Joliet as being the worst place one could possibly live PERIOD I acknowledge that I have the privilege and opportunity to leave home and pursue higher education to my surprise leaving Joliet has made me appreciate it even more PERIOD

Going to a predominantly white and wealthy university has turned my Jolietshame into pride PERIOD I came into the University of Michigan with remnants of hometown embarrassment PERIOD But after missing the diversity in my classrooms and seeing people who looked like me anywhere I went I started to appreciate Joliet more and more PERIOD I missed its cultural richness and going to public schools where the majority of students financial status matched mine and the national average PERIOD At the University many students are also from the Chicagoland area and are familiar with my hometown PERIOD Their perceptions however are often negative and reflect the existing stereotypes about home PERIOD Whenever I tell someone from the Chicagoland area that Im from Joliet I tense up and prepare for them not knowing where that is or having to watch them react as if Id told them something very concerning PERIOD Their responses are usually along the lines of Oh how is that and Im forced to continue to engage in an awkward conversation worried theyre going to think of me differently PERIOD Someone from the northern suburbs which are typically wealthier and less diverse even told me that their friend group has a running joke and a lot of thoughts about Joliet PERIOD In times like these I genuinely never didnt know how to respond PERIOD In high school and early freshman year I would laugh along with the perpetrator to avoid association with the city PERIOD Now however I make sure to stand up against the disrespect of inappropriate comments about my hometown and especially to those who have never lived there PERIOD

Attempting to steer away Joliet trashtalk conversations with other JTown natives is more difficult PERIOD I have had the chance to move hours away from a place Ive lived my entire life something many people dream of doing PERIOD It can be easy for me to love Joliet because I dont have to deal with the many problems that residents do PERIOD I have also had the privilege of living in a middleclass neighborhood with supportive family and friends PERIOD Considering  of students in Joliets public elementary and middle schools live in lowincome housing it is a common sentiment for many of these students to want to escape the physical aspect of poverty and the city they associate with their struggles PERIOD

Many misperceptions others have about Joliet which may be due to the large number of students living in poverty is that it is a gangridden and dangerous place PERIOD On social media I often see many people genuinely believing they could get shot in Joliet citing the disproportionate amount of negative news coverage they have seen about the city PERIOD Just because a city is economically and racially diverse this does not make it dangerous PERIOD The city itself should not be thought of in a negative way either PERIOD Despite crime falling in Joliet people continue to assume acts of crime are the citys fault often stereotyping entire sections of the city as bad ghetto or dangerous. the revival of these public sentiments occurred last weekend when over  people were the victims of a mass shooting that left two young adults dead  injured and many others traumatized PERIOD This horrendous occurrence was an awful action against innocent people trying to have a fun Halloween PERIOD Yet almost immediately social media began to be overrun with placing blame on Joliet and the East Side specifically which is perceived to be more dangerous PERIOD Instead of trying to help the families of the victims many people were talking down on Joliet once again PERIOD In a time when the city needs unity to heal from violence both residents and nonresidents channel their energy into criticizing an entire population and area PERIOD The vast majority of people living in areas with higher rates of crime are victims and cannot be grouped together with the few people causing harm to my community PERIOD

Reflecting on my time at the University of Michigan and studying public policy has made me extremely passionate about returning home and trying to make a change PERIOD Leaving Joliet allowed me to grow and value how ones hometown can provide opportunity and shape them as a person PERIOD Joliet has potential PERIOD Getting involved in the community through community organizing is a more effective way of changing Joliet rather than perceiving it as a lost cause PERIOD

Many believe that Joliet and its residents dont have the ability to change its current condition PERIOD I completely disagree PERIOD Just in  the Joliet Township High School District  won Advanced Placement District of the Year through expanding the number of AP courses students can take and offering summer workshops for each class thus providing important resources often unavailable to minority students and helping students raise their test scores PERIOD And politically Joliet recently elected its firstever Hispanic citycouncil member showing through community organization that the system can change PERIOD The people of this city are strong and united PERIOD I genuinely believe that being from Joliet makes you a stronger person  in the best ways possible PERIOD

Whether its driving down Black Road while blasting music of course past the Joliet Central High School castle and surrounding cultural murals stopping at Mr PERIOD Subs for some food or driving over the I80 bridge with your fingers crossed due to its old age I know Joliet has character PERIOD I love returning home and always tell people how proud I am to be from Joliet PERIOD Yes there are many social and economic problems that must be addressed but through pride unity and community action Joliet can become even more wonderful than it already is PERIOD

For anyone suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder or experiencing emotional distress due to acts of gun violence the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration provides a tollfree emotional distress hotline with resources for local care and support PERIOD To receive counseling over text the Crisis Text Line offers free  support PERIOD To support the families of the victims who passed due to the recent shooting in Joliet you can donate below PERIOD
