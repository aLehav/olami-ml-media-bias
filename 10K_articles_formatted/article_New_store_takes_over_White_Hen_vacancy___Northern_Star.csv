Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Peter SchuhAugust  

Students who suffer from sudden attacks of the midnight munchies can now get relief PERIOD

ot Spot has opened up in the Village Commons  Lucinda Ave. filling the void left when White Hen Pantry closed last semester PERIOD

The store opened July  much to the satisfaction of NIUs night owls PERIOD Were open  hours with a larger product line and cheaper prices than White Hen said Asif Quddus one of Hot Spots managers and a sixyear DeKalb resident PERIOD

He said Hot Spot is doing its best to not only fill White Hens vacancy but also to serve NIUs students better than its predecessor PERIOD The layout is the same but were using it much more intelligently Quddus added PERIOD

Hot Spot offers students a large deli as well as a product assortment that ranges from cigarettes and candy bars to shampoo and contact lens cleaners PERIOD New products include the daily edition of The Wall Street Journal and several assorted adult magazines Quddus said PERIOD There has also been a concerted effort made toward security during the later hours with the addition of overhead mirrors a door alarm and plans to install surveillance cameras said Tere Rivera an employee of Hot Spot who had also worked for White Hen PERIOD

Its totally different here and the changes are for the better Rivera said PERIOD

The management is a lot better and they appreciate suggestions PERIOD The customers have helped a lot Rivera said PERIOD

In general students appear pleased with the new store PERIOD

Its a little different said John Sherk a student who was grabbing a quick snack on the way to class PERIOD Maybe a little better PERIOD I dont really care Im just glad somethings here. advertisement
