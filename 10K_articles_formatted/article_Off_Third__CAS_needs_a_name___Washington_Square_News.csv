OffThird is WSNs satire column PERIOD

As a wideeyed and eager firstyear ready to take New York City by storm you gather all of your belongings and move into your first dorm PERIOD You are excited to attend one of the best universities in the nation PERIOD On the sweaty elevator ride up to your room you decide to network with the upperclassmen helping you move in PERIOD

What college are you in they ask not knowing how else to make conversation PERIOD

CAS you answer excited to be in the school with the most diverse set of majors here at NYU PERIOD

You mean C.A.S. they respond clearly disgusted by your naivete and lack of experience PERIOD You stutter trying to convince them it was an honest mistake but its too late  youve outed yourself as an overzealous firstyear who cant even name their own college PERIOD All your excitement deflates PERIOD Your mind hauntingly replays this conversation for the rest of the day and from now on you only introduce yourself with your major PERIOD

But youre not alone CAS firstyears everywhere face this traumatizing dilemma and to fix it NYU needs to give the College of Arts and Sciences a name PERIOD

Whether CAS as an acronym should be pronounced letter by letter is a debate that shouldnt even exist PERIOD We deserve to have a name that doesnt sound like a mnemonic device PERIOD Most of the schools at NYU have a universally pronounceable name be it Stern Tisch or Steinhardt PERIOD And dont even get me started on Gallatin the BuildABear Workshop of colleges that for some inexplicable reason received the honor of being named after NYUs founder despite CAS being its founding school PERIOD

Even most of the buildings at NYU have a name albeit often for a rich white man who donated millions of dollars to the university a trillion years ago PERIOD Our biggest library Bobst Library is quite literally named after an antisemite PERIOD

Where is the prejudiced legacy of CAS Where is our problematic king to idolize Personally I think the Rudy W PERIOD Giuliani College of Arts and Sciences has a ring to it PERIOD Our logo could even be a bottle of cheap hair dye PERIOD

Not only is CAS a name destined to cause chaos but its also hideously uncreative PERIOD Think about it  would Adam Sandler have attended Tisch if it was named College of Acting No PERIOD Would Robert Greifeld have gone to Stern if it was just called School of Business or SOB for short No PERIOD All the other names have a sense of flair and creativity to them and yet CAS kids are stuck with what is essentially the equivalent of titling a class about writing essays Writing the Essay. cAS students already have very little to bond over PERIOD NYU treats us like the compost bin of schools throwing away all the lastminute majors they couldnt think to put anywhere else PERIOD Why else are the art history chemistry and mathematics departments in the same school

I get it PERIOD Stern and Tisch are the favorite children Stern gets the famed Matto Espresso added onto its already unnecessarily large building and Tisch had Elizabeth Olsen walk its halls PERIOD Gallatin gets to be the quirky but loved teenager going through its emo phase PERIOD Where does CAS fit in

NYU will never solve this identity crisis that haunts CAS students but the first step in improving it would be giving us an actual name PERIOD
