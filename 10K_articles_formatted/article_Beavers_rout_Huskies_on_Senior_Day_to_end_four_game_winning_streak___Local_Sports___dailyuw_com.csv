Updated November     pm





Senior Mercedes Wetmore was held scoreless in her final regularseason game at Hec Edmundson Pavilion as the Huskies were blown out by Oregon State PERIOD

The Washington womens basketball team scored a nearrecord  points Friday against Oregon to earn its fourth straight win PERIOD But two days later the Huskies went cold in their matchup with a team they couldnt afford to shoot poorly against PERIOD

Oregon State which allows the secondfewest points per game in the Pac12 nearly held the UW to half of its point total from Fridays matchup with Oregon PERIOD The Huskies trailed by as many as  points Sunday when the Beavers used their size advantage to win  and spoil Senior Day for the Huskies at Hec Edmundson Pavilion PERIOD

Shortly after Sundays loss head coach Mike Neighbors said his coaching staff had already thrown away its copy of the games film PERIOD

Theres nothing good for us to learn from any of that he said PERIOD Were not going to waste any time thinking of it PERIOD Theres a lot of things we could point to but we absolutely got outplayed PERIOD We cant let it affect us going on the road next week and in the Pac12 tournament. had the Huskies   Pac12 won Sunday they would be tied with OSU for fourth place in the conference heading into the final weekend of the regular season PERIOD The top four teams in the final standings receive a firstround bye in the upcoming Pac12 tournament PERIOD

Early in the first half Sunday the UW stayed within striking distance and looked capable of hanging with the Beavers PERIOD But OSUs height advantage at every position proved to be the difference PERIOD

Starting center Ruth Hamblin a 6foot6 sophomore is at least three inches taller than any UW player and she dominated in the first half with eight points five rebounds and three blocks PERIOD

To end the half Hamblin rebounded her own miss for a putback before blocking a pair of UW shots on the other end PERIOD The Beavers led by  at the break thanks in part to Hamblin who finished the game with  points and  boards PERIOD

When we played her the first time my first thought was that she must have

had an awesome offseason UW guard Jazmine Davis said of Hamblin who has significantly improved her numbers since last season PERIOD When she comes in and dominates a game like that I just think of the hard work it took and it makes me respect them. davis and the UW guards rarely got into the lane Sunday PERIOD When they did Hamblin and the OSU frontcourt disrupted their shots PERIOD And from beyond the arc the Huskies shot just 3of17 for the game PERIOD

Freshman guard Kelsey Plum led the Huskies with  points most of which came after the games outcome was decided PERIOD Senior guard Mercedes Wetmore went scoreless in the final regularseason home game for her and senior Kassia Fortier who is out this season with a shoulder injury PERIOD

It wasnt the storybook senior day for Wetmore but she knows the Huskies still have a lot to play for this year PERIOD They close out the regular season at No PERIOD  Stanford and No PERIOD  California this week PERIOD

If we can get those ones our dreams can still happen this season Wetmore said PERIOD Well rise to the occasion. reach reporter Justin Lester at sportsdailyuw.com PERIOD Twitter JustinDLester
