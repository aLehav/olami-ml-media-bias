Im writing this article to you students on my way home from Israel PERIOD Its Monday morning April  nine oclock Jerusalem time PERIOD Most of you are awake right now in the final hour of your weekend Sunday night at eleven PERIOD Im about to layover in Istanbul before my final leg to LAX PERIOD

Ive thought about you often on this trip as  of us traveled together for  days in Israel PERIOD What I have been thinking about is the hope I have in you and the hope you embody for the world as a generation of reconcilers PERIOD

Yesterday I stood on the Temple Mount the most religiously contested acreage in the world PERIOD Muslims Jews and Christians of all stripes argue that this is their sacred ground PERIOD Symbolized in these  football fields of stone plazas and mosques is the tension embodied among many religious groups who have more often than not fought or divided PERIOD I reflected on the charade of peace that covers the underlying tensions PERIOD I reflected on that Temple Mount that Godwho will one day make all things newwould use this rising generation of Jesus followers to be his peacemakers those he called blessed in his sermon on the Galilean mountainside PERIOD

We are called to be voices of reconciliation and of peace PERIOD Of all the traits I pray you will exemplify as you go through Biola and graduate from heremany of you in a few weeksmy most passionate prayer is that you would live out the redemptive love of Christ wherever you go PERIOD That you would be reconcilers who live the love of Christ PERIOD That you would be called peacemakers PERIOD

That love of Christ is easy to show to the coffee barista when she gets our latte right PERIOD It comes naturally to our family so long as theres harmony PERIOD But living the love of Christ is much harder for those we might have previously ignored avoided judged or condemned PERIOD It is a tougher road when we live in tension with our families or in our residential communities PERIOD But Jesus calls us to demonstrate the power of reconciliation to all who come our way regardless PERIOD Neighbor or stranger PERIOD Roommate or mother PERIOD Colleague or foe PERIOD

More profoundly the life of radical reconciliation calls us to the risk of encountering people with disease those living outside of grace and even those who would threaten to harm or kill us PERIOD What does living this way look like when we extend Christs love to our enemies or the outcast the bullied or the disabled the unsavory or the unlovely What does it look like to love the persecutors of Christians and not just the persecuted

Jesus calls us to the way of reconciliationselfless humble vulnerable open and faithful PERIOD He has called us to live this way even if our attempts at reconciliation are rejected PERIOD

I thought about this on Jerusalems Temple Mount my last Sunday in Israel praying for you students on my way home today that you would lean into reconciliation PERIOD That you would take the risks of loving radically the way Christ has called you to love even if that love is snubbed PERIOD Blessed are the peacemakers Jesus said for they will be called the children of God PERIOD
