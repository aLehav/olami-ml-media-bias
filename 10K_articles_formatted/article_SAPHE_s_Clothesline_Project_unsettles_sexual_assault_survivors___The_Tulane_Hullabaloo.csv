Sexual Aggression Peer Hotline and Education hosted a Healthy Relationships Week as part ofSexual Assault Awareness Month at the beginning of April.SAPHE is a Tulane organization that provides a 24hour sexual aggression hotline and advocates for sexual aggression awareness and prevention PERIOD The organizationhung Tshirts in the LavinBernick Center for University Life decorated with messages against sexual assaultaspart of The Clothesline Project a national program that allows survivorsof sexual assault to express their emotions while increasing sexual aggression awareness PERIOD

While some shirts carried simple messages of survivor support others held detailed accounts of specific attacks PERIOD For example one shirt read My attacker said I flipped my skirt up PERIOD I was wearing a romper. others rattled off statistics about sexual assault on campuses PERIOD

Sexual assault is a crucial issue facing college campuses and organizations that advocate against it play a vital role at Tulane PERIOD The use of provoking visuals and statistics however are indicative of the difficulty in finding a balance between sexual aggression awareness and remaining sensitive to the needs of survivors PERIOD Additionally gendered symbolsimply that sexual assault is a womens issue which minimizes the experiences of victims of other genders PERIOD

While The Clothesline Project supports survivors of sexual aggression who have already connected with SAPHE it may have been damaging to those who have not PERIOD SAPHE cannot be criticized for not speaking with unaffiliated survivors of assaults andit is difficult to hold the organization accountable for the harm it could cause PERIOD But by hanging the shirts in such a highlytrafficked part of campus without any clear prior notification SAPHE left survivors who might have been triggered or emotionally upset by the messages without the choice to avoid them if they desired PERIOD

This situation is indicative of the difficulty faced by many antisexual assault activists in finding a balance between advocacy and survivor support PERIOD While increased awareness is an important step in stopping sexual aggression consideration of survivors must come first PERIOD Public awareness and generation of dialogue are essential for reducing incidences of sexual aggression PERIOD Increased communication prior to sexual assault awareness week would give sexual aggression survivors the knowledge necessary to avoid visuals that could be unsettling or provoking PERIOD
