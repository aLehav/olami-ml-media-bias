Ill admit it PERIOD I didnt believe them PERIOD

At least in my mind playing in the NIT was like going to the
prom with Britney Spears cousin PERIOD Its nice PERIOD But it
really doesnt come close to the real thing PERIOD

So when I went down to Crisler Arena on Monday and listened to
player after player tell me that they were excited to play in
college basketballs secondbest postseason tournament out
of two I was skeptical PERIOD

Sure they had to say that I thought PERIOD But its only the
NIT PERIOD I thought back to when Georgetown declined its invite to the
 NIT so that its players could go to class PERIOD I found it hard to
believe that the Wolverines were as motivated to win the thing as
they made it seem PERIOD

But Michigan proved me wrong PERIOD It pulled out a gutsy win last
night PERIOD And everyone from rows one through three whose drink was
spilled by one of the many diving Wolverines knows how badly the
team wanted it PERIOD

Just watching the game you wouldnt have known that
Sunday night the players gathered on campus with a hope of getting
into the NCAA Tournament only to learn that they werent
going to reach their seasonlong goal PERIOD The NIT was the teams
first postseason appearance since  PERIOD But it wasnt what
the Wolverines were shooting for PERIOD

Yet they stepped out onto the floor last night and played like
everything was still on the line PERIOD

We had to play right away said Michigan coach
Tommy Amaker of the teams quick turnaround between games PERIOD
So we didnt have time to think about it or feel sorry
for ourselves about the other tournament. daniel Horton was the poster boy for that effort PERIOD With less than
 seconds remaining the sophomore guard laid the ball in to put
his team up three and came down in pain PERIOD He struggled up the floor
stumbling once or twice on his injured leg and then he actually
jumped into the pile under the Missouri rim at the other end of the
floor to tip a loose ball to senior Bernard Robinson PERIOD

He could barely walk off the court during the ensuing dead ball PERIOD
But the pain didnt stop him from putting himself on the line
when his team needed a rebound PERIOD Even if it was just the NIT PERIOD

We pride ourselves on getting loose balls forward
Brent Petway said PERIOD We know that those can lead to big
plays. yeah the Wolverines did give up a  run in the second half
and allowed a ninepoint lead to become an eightpoint deficit PERIOD I
couldnt help but think about some of the other secondhalf
lapses that have doomed the Wolverines this year see Minnesota
Michigan State to name a few PERIOD

But Michigan hustled its way back in the last  minutes when
it could have just as easily have rolled over and let things get
out of hand PERIOD

Theres a lot of teams that arent playing
right now so its not that hard to get motivated
Petway said PERIOD

Playing at home didnt hurt either PERIOD The crowd at Crisler
Arena wasnt huge but it was loud PERIOD Michigan has always
seemed much more comfortable at home this year anyway PERIOD

If the team keeps playing as hard as it did last night it could
go deep into this thing PERIOD

In the end I guess I was wrong PERIOD Maybe when you havent
been to a prom in a number of years it doesnt really matter
who you go with PERIOD
