Minutes earlier the former president said  First lady for his presidency shes now the Democratic Partys standardbearer in the race for the White House PERIOD

For a man more accustomed to delivering policypacked stemwinders Clintons deeply personal address underscored the historic night for Democrats and the nation PERIOD If she wins in November the Clintons would also be the first married couple to each serve as president PERIOD

She will take on Donald Trump who won the Republican nomination a week ago PERIOD Trump who campaigned Tuesday in North Carolina mocked the former presidents speech in advance calling him 

At Trumps convention last week Clinton was the target of blistering criticism of her character and judgment a sharp contrast to the warm and passionate woman described by her husband PERIOD Seeking to explain the vastly different perceptions of his wife Clinton said simply 

The former president traced his relationship with his wife back decades recalling in great detail the first time he spotted her on a law school campus and the impact she had on pushing him into politics PERIOD He took voters back to a time when their relationship wasnt the subject of intense public scrutiny including during his affair that led to his impeachment as president PERIOD

Clinton closed the second night of the Democratic convention a jubilant celebration of Hillary Clintons formal nomination for president PERIOD In an important move for party unity her primary rival Bernie Sanders helped make it official when the roll call got to his home state of Vermont prompting delegates to erupt in cheers PERIOD It was a striking parallel to the role Clinton played eight years ago when she stepped to the microphone on the convention floor in Denver in support of her former rival Barack Obama PERIOD

This time Clinton shattered the glass ceiling she couldnt crack in  PERIOD

She leads a party still grappling with divisions PERIOD Moments after Clinton claimed the nomination a group of Sanders supporters left the convention and headed to a media tent to protest what they said was their being shut out of the party PERIOD At the same time protesters who had spent the day marching in the hot sun began facing off with police PERIOD

Indeed Clintons long political resume  secretary of state senator first lady  has sometimes seemed an odd fit for an electorate deeply frustrated with Washington and eager to rally around unconventional candidates like Trump and Sanders PERIOD Many voters have questions about her character and trustworthiness suggesting shes used her access to power to her personal advantage PERIOD

President Clinton spoke after three hours of testimonials from lawmakers advocates celebrities and citizens who argued otherwise PERIOD Each took the stage to vouch for her commitment to working on health care childrens issues and gun control PERIOD

 said Sybrina Fulton whose son Trayvon Martin was killed in  PERIOD 

The significant time devoted to the testimonials underscored the campaigns concerns about how voters view Clinton PERIOD Public polls consistently show that a majority of Americans dont believe she is honest and trustworthy PERIOD That perception that was reinforced after the FBI directors scathing assessment of her controversial email use as secretary of state even though the Justice Department did not pursue charges PERIOD

President Clinton complicated the email controversy last month when he met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch in the midst of the FBI investigation PERIOD Republicans cast the meeting as a sign that the Clintons play by different rules while Democrats bemoaned that at the very least it left that impression PERIOD

The former president has campaigned frequently for his wife during the White House race but mostly in smaller cities and towns part of an effort by the campaign to keep him in a more behindthescenes role PERIOD His convention address was his highest profile appearance of the campaign PERIOD

Clintons landmark achievement saturated the roll call with emotion and symbols of womens long struggle to break through political barriers PERIOD Jerry Emmett a 102yearold woman born before women had the right to vote cast the ballots for Arizona PERIOD

Martha McKenna a Clinton delegate from Maryland said the night felt like a celebration for Sanders campaign as well as Clintons PERIOD She added 

The Democratic convention drew the partys biggest stars to sweltering Philadelphia for the weeklong event PERIOD On Monday night first lady Michelle Obama made an impassioned case for Clinton as the only candidate in the presidential race worthy of being a role model for the nations children PERIOD President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will speak Wednesday along with Virginia Sen PERIOD Tim Kaine Clintons new running mate PERIOD
