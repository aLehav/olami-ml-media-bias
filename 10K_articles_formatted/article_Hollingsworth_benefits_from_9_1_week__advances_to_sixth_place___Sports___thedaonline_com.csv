Gabe Hollingsworth moved up four spots to sixth place after going  last week PERIOD

Hollingsworths only loss was the NebraskaTexas Tech game PERIOD However he wasnt the only one PERIOD

Every Challenge the Guru participant picked the Huskers to come away victorious PERIOD

DA Sports Writer Matt Gottfried and the Marshall mascot yes the Marshall mascot were the only ones to see the Red Raiders coming away victorious PERIOD

NU might have  consecutive sellouts but I think its safe to say that none of us are sold on the Huskers after last weeks performance PERIOD

Ryan Rueben finished  to maintain a fivepoint lead over Daniel Cassis PERIOD

Meanwhile Derek Walls and Brian Scott are knotted in a tie for third place just nine points out of first place PERIOD

This week though were making it interesting PERIOD If you pick Auburn and the Tigers upset LSU then you get an additional five points PERIOD

This gamble could make your season PERIOD

Onto the games



CONNECTICUT vs PERIOD WEST VIRGINIA

Playing in their first game since the death of cornerback Jasper Howard the nation will be watching to see how the Huskies respond PERIOD

But if youre going to judge this game strictly with offthefield issues aside West Virginia has the advantage PERIOD

Pick West Virginia



TEXAS vs PERIOD MISSOURI

The Longhorns didnt look like too much of a top  team against Oklahoma last week especially early on PERIOD

But if theres one thing about Texas its that the Longhorns always respond PERIOD

After beating Oklahoma by  points last season Texas responded the following week by scoring  points against thenNo PERIOD  Missouri PERIOD

Pick Texas



TCU vs PERIOD BYU

These two teams present an interesting matchup PERIOD

While TCU is fourth nationally in total defense its twenty-second in total offense PERIOD

BYU meanwhile is forty-eighth in total defense but seventh in total offense PERIOD

However BYU has already been tested against the likes of Oklahoma and Florida State PERIOD This will be TCUs first game against a ranked opponent this season PERIOD

Pick BYU

Who knew that Purdue was such a tough place to play huh

The Buckeyes will respond this week against a Minnesota team that struggled against Penn State last week PERIOD

Pick Ohio State



BOSTON COLLEGE vs PERIOD NOTRE DAME

Did anyone feel bad for Notre Dame after it lost against USC last week Was anyone excited for the Trojans

The only thing that couldve made that game less dissatisfying was if Tim Tebow was on special teams PERIOD

The Eagles are the better team entering this matchup but Notre Dame will likely try to find another way to squeak this one out PERIOD

Pick Notre Dame



CLEMSON vs PERIOD MIAMI

Clemson pulled out a  win over a pretty decent Wake Forest squad last week PERIOD But the Tigers have yet to win on the road this year including an embarrassing loss to Maryland PERIOD

Miamis next five games are against ACC opponents and if the Hurricanes want to return as conference champions it starts this week PERIOD

Pick Miami



OREGON vs PERIOD WASHINGTON

Steve Sarkisians early season success looks to be wearing off PERIOD

The Huskies have lost three of their last four with the win as a threepoint victory over Arizona at home PERIOD

Pick Oregon



PENN STATE vs PERIOD MICHIGAN

While Penn State is No PERIOD  in the country with a  record none of the Nittany Lions wins stand out PERIOD Their schedule is embarrassing PERIOD

The only strong team PSU has played this year was go figure an 11point loss to Iowa PERIOD

Pick Michigan
