Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Tom Clegg and Jeff KirikApril  

More muscle was added to the NIU Athletic Board Wednesday in the form of four resolutions passed by the board PERIOD

Three of the resolutions take effect as soon as they are added to the boards policy manual PERIOD They cover conference affiliation budget matters not previously covered by the board and academic affairs of athletes PERIOD Since the board does not meet regularly during the summer these three changes will probably not be made until next fall PERIOD

The fourth resolution which must be approved by the University Council will increase the boards representation on search committees for head coaches and athletic administrators PERIOD

Wednesdays passage of the first resolution gives the board power over proposals to join and withdraw from athletic conferences PERIOD It also gives the board a voice in the universitys votes for approving new conference members PERIOD The proposal passed by a  vote with two abstentions PERIOD

The second resolution requires that the board approve accounts it has not approved in the past PERIOD An example of an account which the board has not previously approved is the athletic funds in the NIU Foundation PERIOD Among those funds would be money raised through contributions to the NIU Huskies Athletic Association PERIOD

The third resolution gives the board the power to set up an ad hoc committee to oversee the academic affairs of athletes PERIOD The committee will review existing programs at NIU and make recommendations to the board regarding their impact on athletes academic progress PERIOD The board hopes to establish this committee as soon as possible next fall PERIOD

The fourth resolution which requires that three board members be included on search committees for head coaches and athletic department administrators was amended to include one student representative from the board PERIOD Interim chairman James Mellard an English professor cast a tiebreaking vote to approve the amendment PERIOD

On March  the board passed a resolution that the firing of a head coach must be approved by the board PERIOD This also must be approved by the UC before it takes effect PERIOD

The board passed this resolution after Athletic Director Gerald ODell fired mens basketball coach Jim Rosborough on March  PERIOD

Curtis Norton then the boards chairman resigned in protest of ODells action PERIOD Norton and others were upset that a fouryear verbal commitment given to Rosborough by an NIU search committee had been broken PERIOD NIU President John LaTourette replaced Norton with Mellard as the boards interim chairman PERIOD
