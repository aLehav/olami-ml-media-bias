The KU Office of Diversity and Equity created a badge to award students and faculty who attend four total events per year fromthe Office of Diversity and Equity Center for Sexuality and Gender Diversity Emily Taylor Center for Women and Gender Equity or the Office of Multicultural Affairs PERIOD

Since completing the Social Justice Fellows program earlier this year Brandy Ernzen hears Cody Charles voice often she said and its telling her to do the work. ernzen is the program coordinator for Indigenous Studies and Museum Studiesand was part of the Office of Multicultural Affairs  Social Justice Fellows program PERIOD The program which is open to staff and faculty will hold its third session in the upcoming spring semester and is currently accepting applications PERIOD

Charles is the associate director for diversity education and social justice programs for OMA and is one of the facilitators of the Social Justice Fellows program PERIOD One of the major goals of the program he said is to offer continued education to staff and faculty members and to discuss what it means to create inclusive spaces on a college campus. the idea was to create a classroom experience where we talk about social justice power and privilege Charles said and then creating inclusive spaces. the initiative was started he said in an effort to debunk the idea that offices such as OMA are solely responsible for creating inclusive spaces on college campuses and to encourage individuals to share the responsibility PERIOD

I think that on college campuses is this idea that multicultural affairs or diversity units are supposed to be the folks that do all the work around creating inclusive spaces Charles said PERIOD I think if we want an inclusive atmosphere and inclusive spaces on this campus and on any campus it has to become everyones job. the group will meet every other week during the spring semester PERIOD The program consists of discussions homework and sometimes guest speakers Ernzen recalled PERIOD

Emily Gullickson diversity and social justice educationprogram coordinator for OMA is also a facilitator of the fellows program PERIOD

I think that Social Justice Fellows is a great opportunity for staff and faculty to begin and continue engaging in critical conversations and are able to bring back what they learned to their own units and departments to create more equitable and inclusive spaces for all students staff and faculty she said in an email with the Kansan PERIOD

Ernzen also noted that utilizing new knowledge is a key part of Social Justice Fellows PERIOD

That is really the theme there is to not just learn about these issues but to really try to do something about them  dont just stop with learning she said PERIOD And you dont have to be an expert on any of these issues to see that there are problems within them and to try to make positive change. after completing the program Ernzen said she has been trying to implement what she learned into her work at the University PERIOD

I have offered to facilitate the University  social justice class as well as the Tunnel of Oppressions debriefing sessions she said PERIOD And Im not somebody whos super comfortable standing in front of a group of people but again I heard Cody saying do the work so Ive been trying to do that. ernzen said she has also tried to address issues that she felt were problematic to marginalized groups at different meetings she has attended PERIOD

You know once your eyes are opened you have to keep forging ahead I think she said PERIOD

Ernzen said she would recommend the program to other staff and faculty members PERIOD

I think these issues are not going away by any means and theyre only being amplified I think in this climate she said PERIOD And the more people are aware of them the more they take interest in maybe doing something positive to change the state of affairs PERIOD That can only be good. around  or  people have completed the program in the past Charles estimated and around  will be accepted into the program during the upcoming spring semester PERIOD

The facilitators are looking for a diverse group of individuals who want to take part in the conversation and then put what they learned into action he said PERIOD

Charles acknowledged that people sometimes think these conversations are not meant to be had in a professional setting but he said thats not true PERIOD

This is a conversation about making sure that everyone has access to resources and to positive outcomes and access to thrive Charles said PERIOD And this is about honoring histories and where we come from and where we are now PERIOD And this is just about creating room and space for all of us. the deadline to apply for the spring  session is Dec PERIOD  PERIOD If accepted applicants are asked to pay a  fee if they are able which goes toward materials and costs of the program PERIOD Inability to pay will not affect acceptance into the program PERIOD Applications are available online PERIOD
