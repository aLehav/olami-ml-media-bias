Were an institution that has an incredible role in society PERIOD We want to make this place as great as it can be said UIF President Thomas Farrell PERIOD

UIF is an agency that handles University fundraising efforts and incoming donations PERIOD Farrell said the average annual funding the foundation has received the last three years from alumni and other donations has been around  million but the goal is to raise that number to around  million seven to  years from now PERIOD

Right now UIF is deliberating over the budget and how to bring in more donations but Farrell said the new plan will be in action around January  PERIOD

Were ready to go PERIOD Its time to carry this plan out the next six years said Vice Chancellor for Development Jeff Lorber PERIOD



The staff at UIF refer to themselves as people trying to bring color to the Universitys vision. we want to connect our vision as directly as possible to the chancellor vice chancellor deans and the president Farrell said PERIOD

To do that UIF wants to increase the yearly donations from alumni PERIOD As of now nearly  alumni actively donate each year PERIOD

The alumni have been very supportive Farrell said PERIOD Our interest though is to better connect with them and improve what is a pretty good base PERIOD If you compare our level of engagement to other Big Ten institutions there is room for improvement PERIOD Its good but wed like it to be better. last year the foundation received key donations from the Grainger Foundation for  million the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for  million and State Farm in the agreement regarding the name change of Assembly Hall for  million PERIOD

Vice President Don Kojich said the Gates family approached UIF when they were looking to donate to the Universitys program designed to improve crop photosynthesis PERIOD

Thats unusual because with most foundations you approach them he said PERIOD

Farrell said he tries to reach out to alumni so he can help them feel more connected to the campus and its that familial relationship that drives donations PERIOD The same thing applies to wealthy foundations he said PERIOD

When millions of dollars are involved the process of donating takes awhile PERIOD

The vast majority of it is all about building those relationships PERIOD These types of gifts dont happen overnight Kojich said PERIOD

Taylor Polydore a junior in Media who made phone calls to ask for donations last year said that the more donations the foundation got the more involved the alumni were PERIOD

You give them incentives to go to games she said PERIOD They say oh I give this much money and theyll give me a ticket. its these relationships that are piecing together the University that Chancellor Phyllis Wise wants to see Farrell said PERIOD

Were responding to her vision he said. and our goal is to try to raise money and support that plan which helps make that dream become a reality. stanton can be reached at emailprotected PERIOD",UI Foundation plans to double funds - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
