4169,2001-03-01,"one of the primary mission objectives of Mothers Against Drunk Driving is to support the victims of violent crime PERIOD Consequently we have quite a bit of experience in grief counseling relatives and friends of victims PERIOD What follows is a condensed version of what we tell those who seek our services PERIOD

There is a commonality in the emotional consequences for the family and friends of a victim of a violent death regardless of the form it may take PERIOD What can anybody possibly say to a person who has suddenly lost a family member or friend in such a manner How does one answer the unanswerable question of why

First of all you who are going through just about every emotion possible are not going crazy PERIOD This is part of the grieving process PERIOD Shock and disbelief are usually followed by anger once the reality sets in PERIOD Then there is the sorrow and pain of the loss PERIOD This process must be faced and the grief worked through if there is to be any resolution to your feelings PERIOD The pain will subside PERIOD But dont worry you will not forget your friends PERIOD There will be flashes of their memory for the rest of your life PERIOD The hope is that these flashes will be happy memories PERIOD What can you do to have that happen Talk to each other PERIOD Remember the good times PERIOD Laugh along with the tears PERIOD Isnt this what you would like your friends to do for you

It is my belief that we have three options when it comes to choosing our actions during this period

 You can destroy out of anger PERIOD You will feel anger at the event that robbed you of your friend PERIOD You didnt get to say goodbye or how much that friendship meant to you PERIOD You are angry with the driver of the car PERIOD This is natural PERIOD The question is what you will do with this feeling If you let it control you it will destroy you and the relationships around you PERIOD

 You can do nothing out of fear PERIOD Will you stop driving be fearful to go outside at night become emotionally withdrawn because of this tragedy

 Or you can build out of love PERIOD You cared about your friends PERIOD Is there any better way to remember them than to care for others The act of giving of yourself helps to minimize the pain you feel focuses your emotions toward others in need and is a tribute to your friend PERIOD Find an organization that works toward eliminating the cause or causes of this tragedy and devote some of your time to it PERIOD You will find that this helps give meaning to the loss PERIOD

Finally if you have spiritual beliefs pray PERIOD Pray for peace for yourself and comfort for the family and friends of these young people and yes even the driver of the car PERIOD

Whatever you do try to remember that your friend is standing next to you and watching what you are doing PERIOD Will your actions make him or her smile
