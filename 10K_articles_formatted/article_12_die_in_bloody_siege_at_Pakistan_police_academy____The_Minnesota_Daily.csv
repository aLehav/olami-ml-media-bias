equipment is coming  it should be stopped he told state TV PERIOD Whoever the antistate elements are they are destabilizing the country. the attacks pose a major test for the civilian administration

there will be greater silence she said PERIOD Everyone is so fearful of the lethality of these organizations people wont get up to protest PERIOD The government is willing to crack down on these
