On Friday night a similar roar of applause to the one that filled Temples McGonigle Hall in April  bounced off the walls in Ann Arbors Glick Ballroom PERIOD

A room full of people crowded around nine round tables overlooking the golf course along East Stadium Boulevard eyes glued to the projector screen PERIOD On it the faintlycolored film from the day that forever solidified the  Michigan mens gymnastics teams place in history rolled PERIOD Nearly half a century later players from that national championship team still recall April   well PERIOD

Over  months of planning went into the reunion largely facilitated by a committee of four team members  Ron Rapper Murray Plotkin Ray Gura and Ed Howard PERIOD

When the idea of a reunion was first floated the committee estimated about  people would come PERIOD The team itself included  lettermen of which two have passed away PERIOD Just two still live in Michigan while others have settled as far away as Colorado Florida and Arizona PERIOD The proposition of every living teammate making the trip felt farfetched at first but after the committee put out a feeler it became reality quickly PERIOD

Eighteen months later  people packed the Glick Ballroom to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the teams national championship PERIOD Some former players brought up to three generations of family to the dinner while others traveled alone or with a spouse PERIOD Championship banners draped from the windows and the championship trophy sat on a table adjacent to the door as guests walked in PERIOD

Since  the Michigan mens gymnastics program is responsible for seven of the universitys  team national championships PERIOD Following the  title it took three decades for the program to hoist the trophy again PERIOD But the  teams impact on the perception surrounding the sport on campus goes far beyond a slab of iron with a championship inscription PERIOD

Makes one feel as if weve come of age and are considered as one of the major sports on our campus coach Newt Loken wrote in his annual team newsletter that summer PERIOD You men have elevated the sport of gymnastics to what some have declared a fantastically beautiful sport. more often than not the  national championship felt out of Michigans reach PERIOD Eight teams qualified for the twoday preliminary qualifiers in Philadelphia with the top three advancing to the finals the following day PERIOD

The Wolverines found themselves in fourth place at the close of the afternoon session PERIOD With their season on the line they surged past Southern Illinois and Temple to clinch a spot in the next days field PERIOD

Just over  hours later Michigan needed more than a surge PERIOD It needed a miracle PERIOD With every routine in the books besides one the Wolverines trailed Iowa State the heavy favorite by . points  a lofty score at the time according to Rapper PERIOD Silence fell over McGonigle Hall as Howard the last man standing stepped up to the horizontal bars PERIOD With the pressure of an entire season on his shoulders Howard delivered a careerbest . pERIOD

The national championship was decided by onetenth of a point  the scoring difference of a slight arm flex a threedegree vertical error or an inadvertent slight step on a dismount PERIOD Howard put the perfect bowtie on a  season forever cementing the team among Michigans alltime best PERIOD

The Wolverines narrow margin in the championship mightve been thrilling but it wasnt an accurate portrayal of how badly Michigan beat teams during that era PERIOD Beginning in  the team won four consecutive Big Ten titles posting a  dual meet record across a threeyear period in the process PERIOD The Wolverines won those meets by an average of five points PERIOD Thats the equivalent of a  win in football and  score in baseball according to Rapper PERIOD



Ironically enough the reunion began with a lost ring PERIOD

When trampoline champion Goerge Huntzicker discovered his championship ring was missing two years ago he phoned Rapper  the teams captain  to ask how to get a new one PERIOD These types of rings are hard to come by so Rapper thought it was worth it to reach out to the whole team to see if other players lost their rings too PERIOD The wheels began turning in his head and soon enough the idea snowballed PERIOD

A longoverdue reunion was in order PERIOD Using the event as an opportunity to issue redesigned rings to the team was the perfect reason to bring everyone to the Ann Arbor PERIOD But the face of the man responsible for building the team was missing as Loken passed away in  at the age of  PERIOD

Winning a championship is the pinnacle of college athletics Rapper said PERIOD And for this championship credit must go to our coach Newt Loken PERIOD  He emphasized the importance of hitting your routine and instilled in us the pride of representing Michigan in the sport of gymnastics PERIOD It was Newt who engineered our victory PERIOD In what is traditionally an individuallyfocused sport this team victory was very special. added Plotkin Loken knew how to make things happen PERIOD He knew how to say things in a way that made you want to stretch yourself. when Michigan granted varsity status to its mens gymnastics team in  Loken was named the programs first coach PERIOD From there the program was off and running PERIOD As a  national high bar and allaround champion at Minnesota he had the perfect pedigree to shape and lead an elite program PERIOD He remained at the helm for  years compiling a  career record while winning a pair of NCAA titles and overseeing  Big Ten individual event championships PERIOD

Plotkin graduated in  but remained in Ann Arbor to complete his masters degree PERIOD Loken nearing the end of his career made Plotkin his first assistant coach PERIOD To this day he raves about how lucky he was to have the dual perspective of both playing and working for Loken PERIOD

Lokens death in  marked the end of an era in mens gymnastics PERIOD Even after retiring from coaching he didnt miss a single home meet for  years PERIOD In fact once Loken retired his successor named an award for best individual performance at each home meet after him PERIOD Loken presented the award a certificate which quickly became one of the programs highest honors until  PERIOD

Loken was unlike nearly every other coach who has reached legendary status in his or her sport wrote former Daily sports editor Colt Rosensweig author of the biography Newt The Father of Michigan Mens Gymnastics PERIOD Instead of barking orders like a drill sergeant Newt resembled a kindly father PERIOD His unflagging optimism and constant encouragement  not to mention his excellent technical skills  motivated his gymnasts more than a good chewing out ever could. the program fell out of contention after Loken retired posting eight straight losing seasons during the decade prior to current coach Kurt Golders hiring in  PERIOD While the Wolverines suffered through their winless  season Golder served as the top assistant at Iowa  a program trending in the opposite direction PERIOD With little ambition to become a head coach at the time Golder was content PERIOD

That is until Loken called him PERIOD The next day Loken called again PERIOD And again PERIOD He wouldnt take no for an answer PERIOD

Ultimately Golder accepted the job  a testament to Loken and his legacy PERIOD It only took Golder three years to transform a winless team into a national champion PERIOD The program hasnt looked back winning three more national titles since PERIOD



As the guests dined on salads roasted Yukon potatoes and pecan crusted chicken Rapper approached the podium PERIOD Rappers grandson an aspiring gymnast himself was one of the  pairs of eyes on the front of the room PERIOD Lokens children sat at the front table while Plotkins grandchildren played with a ball in the back of the room PERIOD

Beyond the applause that accompanied Howards nowlegendary . three generations of admiration chatter and pride brought an equal presence to the room PERIOD And the bond shared amongst the  teammates proved to be as strong as ever PERIOD

Its great to get the band back together Rapper said PERIOD Theres something to be said about the athletic bond that ties together members of an athletic team PERIOD The bond is particularly strong that brings together an NCAA championship team. now they have new rings to show for it PERIOD
