Apologizing for the interruption an employee of Saints Rest Coffee House tells Betty Moffett that someone is on the phone PERIOD Theyre asking where they can purchase a copy of Moffetts new book PERIOD Moffett asks the employee to tell them its available at the Pioneer Bookstore PERIOD

Moffet took this brief interaction in stride PERIOD The use of Saints Rest as a directory for community information an interest shared by many Grinnellians in supporting the work of fellow community members and the fact that Moffett just happened to be in the cafe all stood out as a nod to the interconnectedness and coincidence which defines smalltown living PERIOD

Released on Oct PERIOD  by Ice Cube Press of North Liberty Iowa Coming Clean is a collection of  short stories authored by Moffett PERIOD Based on Moffetts memories of North Carolina and Grinnell Moffett introduces readers to the characters who have dotted the communities she has called home PERIOD

For Moffett small exchanges have made small town living in the South and the Midwest alike PERIOD There are funny little relationships that you have in a town this size and you cant push those boundaries you cant overstep said Moffett PERIOD This advice is echoed in her story Mirror Mirror. a reflection on the relationship between hairdresser and customer Moffett explores an imagined friendship between the two PERIOD Moffett claims that the smalltown boundary provides comfort establishing a standard for the relationship that must grow patiently with time PERIOD Moffett came to Grinnell with her husband Professor Emeritus Sandy Moffett theatre and dance about thirty years ago PERIOD As a member of Too Many Strings Band and a former director of the Grinnell College Writing Lab Moffetts interests intersect with different art forms  writing theatre and music  all platforms that can transport someone into the experience of another PERIOD

The stories are set in the communities Moffett has called home and the characters in her books are people who the reader may imagine nodding to on the street PERIOD The book grants readers knowledge of the characters shortcomings and a fondness for the peculiarities Moffett poses as strengths PERIOD

Communicated through dialogue the development of characters is given priority lines of description detailing the setting are forfeited in favor of creating threedimensional characters PERIOD It is through these characters that the reader gets a sense of the books setting PERIOD Once the reader knows the subject of the story they are equipped with a notion of how such a person might surround themselves what setting would best suit them PERIOD

Ive never been particularly interested in when or where Moffett said explaining her focus on dialogue and the piecemeal nature of the stories chronology PERIOD It is here that Moffetts stories become recognizable not as memoir but as fiction PERIOD

There are some things Moffett does not remember and some things she is not going to tell PERIOD Some things she will lie about PERIOD For her the lines between memoir and fiction are permeable PERIOD She cannot make up the basis for what she writes about but she is not opposed to changing what does not fit what she does not like and reworking the story in hopes of resolution PERIOD

Somebody said once and maybe particularly with short stories Start from the hurt. it doesnt mean disaster it doesnt mean tornado it doesnt mean murder but start from something that hurt you Moffett said PERIOD And if you feel something then it transfers from wherever feelings lie into your mind and your memory and you remember those things.Sometimes the hurt gets resolved sometimes you find a way around the hurt and sometimes the hurt is not resolved. brothers is one such story exempt from resolution PERIOD Professor Ralph Savarese English wrote in a statement printed on the back of the book By holding back the stories reveal lifes mysteries all the more and they pay homage to the laconic dignity of the people Betty Moffett writes about PERIOD The final story called Brothers will break your heart in the best possible way. one of the first stories Moffett ever wrote is the collections opening account The Store. written about thirty years ago  around the time she moved to Grinnell  she had just begun meeting with a group whose membership oscillated between four and eight writers who shared poetry short stories and encouragement PERIOD

That was my daddys story  he never told it the same way twice PERIOD Nobody did nobody told stories the same way  they added things it was expected it was entertainment Moffett said PERIOD

Years ago when she first asked him to read the story he replied that it sounded familiar but he did not recognize any of the characters PERIOD Somewhere along the line between his telling and her filtering it through her mind the interpretation changed PERIOD

The stories of her childhood have undergone evolutions and revolutions a process Moffett says steeps her stories in nostalgia PERIOD Growing up in a family of storytellers family tales were committed to the Ferguson Family Anthology a source of collective memory PERIOD Such is the nature of storytelling such is the nature of memoir becoming fiction PERIOD

Moffett will read from her collection at the Grinnell Arts Center on Nov PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD alongside the music of violinist Professor Tammy McGavock economics PERIOD Her book is available at the Pioneer Bookstore PERIOD
