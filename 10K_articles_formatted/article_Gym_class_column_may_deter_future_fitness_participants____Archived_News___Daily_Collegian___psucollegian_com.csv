As an aerobics instructor at the White Building I was very upset to read Allison Busaccas opinion of her  instructor  Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

While it is true the instructors try to encourage motivate and push our participants to challenge themselves I do not think any of us do so in a menacing fashion PERIOD Im not sure why Busacca chose to berate her instructor in such a way PERIOD If that instructors style werent a perfect match for Busacca she should try a class scheduled at a different time PERIOD She may not have found her perfect fit but that class was probably motivating to a majority of the participants PERIOD Not only did Busacca criticize her expert instructors style but she also divulged that she and her friend laughed throughout half of the class they attended PERIOD So besides doing herself a disservice she contributed to disrupting the whole class  making it hard for others to concentrate and get an effective workout PERIOD

But what I find most disturbing about Busaccas piece is that her column was probably a great excuse for many wouldbe exercisers to skip the gym PERIOD It is hard enough for participants to get themselves out the door and to the gym especially in cold weather PERIOD Reading a column such as this could only serve as a detriment to the health of not only an individual but to the entire student body PERIOD
