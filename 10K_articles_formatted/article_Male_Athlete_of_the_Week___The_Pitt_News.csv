When Adam Plutecki began basic skills of swimming classes in third grade in his homeland of Poland he had no idea that it would some day lead him to the United States PERIOD

After a year of weekly twohour practices a final event was placed where the young students could display what they had learned PERIOD It was there that a coach noticed Pluteckis skills and asked him to join a club swimming team PERIOD

In high school he went on to win several medals in the Polish junior championships while competing for the  Polish national team PERIOD

As his high school years neared to an end Plutecki set his goals on crossing the Atlantic and going to college in the United States PERIOD
