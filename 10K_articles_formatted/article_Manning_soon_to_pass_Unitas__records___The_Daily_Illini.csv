2368,2023-11-04,"colts QB Peyton Manning  throws a pass against the Bucs on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS DARRON CUMMINGS

By Michael Marot October  

INDIANAPOLIS  When Lenny Moore watches Peyton Manning he sees a little bit of John Unitas on every play PERIOD

The deliberate steps the hunched shoulders the way Manning carries himself on the field PERIOD Its pure Johnny U. almost down to the legendary 2minute drill PERIOD

So perhaps its fitting that the two greatest quarterbacks in Colts history are linked in the teams record books PERIOD Manning needs three touchdown passes to break Unitas franchise record  a number some people including Moore contend does not make Manning better PERIOD

Im happy for Peyton and I mean that in all sincerity said Moore a Hall of Fame running back who played with Unitas in Baltimore PERIOD As a former player I truly admire his ball playing PERIOD

But Peyton Manning is no Johnny Unitas PERIOD The game has changed tremendously over the years and if the game was played the way it is now what Johnny U PERIOD would have done is unbelievable. from the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

What Unitas did then is still amazing PERIOD

Of the top  quarterbacks in yards passing and the top seven in TD passes Unitas and Fran Tarkenton remain the only vestiges to the premerger days PERIOD

Too young to watch Unitas play live the 31yearold Manning still recalls his father Archie citing Unitas as his favorite quarterback because of his ability to run the hurryup offense and produce heroic comebacks PERIOD

It became the model for Peytons era PERIOD He now relies on the nohuddle as his base offense changes plays at the line of scrimmage  like Unitas used to in the huddle  and incorporates his teammates in much the manner Unitas did PERIOD

Back then it was revoluationary PERIOD Now its trendy PERIOD

Even the offensive components have a familiar look PERIOD Unitas relied on an array of Hall of Fame teammates such as Moore John Mackey and Raymond Berry while Mannings supporting cast has included Marvin Harrison and Edgerrin James the franchises new career leaders in receiving and rushing PERIOD

Manning credits Unitas for defining the position for future generations PERIOD He once offered to wear a pair of Johnny Us trademark black hightops as a tribute after Unitas died Sept PERIOD   PERIOD The NFL said no PERIOD

So despite the numbers last years Super Bowl MVP still finds it humbling and awkward to be mentioned in the same sentence as Unitas PERIOD

I think he did a lot to change the true passing game in the NFL Manning said PERIOD I always feel a little uncomfortable when my name is mentioned in the same statistical category as him. hed better get used to it PERIOD

Already the franchise leader in completions  Manning is likely to pass Unitas for two more Colts records  attempts and yardage  in the next month PERIOD He needs  more passes and  more yards to surpass both PERIOD

And with some good fortune Manning will soon be the Colts career leader in victories too PERIOD Unitas won  games as a Colt while Manning has  victories in  fewer games entering Monday night PERIOD

Of course the NFL regular season was shorter in Unitas days PERIOD

Judging from Moores description of Unitas however the two might be more similar than it appears on the field PERIOD

Johnny studied the game and watched films Moore recalls PERIOD He and Raymond Berry took it to the nth degree about how you can do this when you can do this or why you should do this PERIOD Johnny called things in the huddle you just wouldnt believe.",Manning soon to pass Unitas' records - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
