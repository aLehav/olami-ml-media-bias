Being a sports writer is a dream job for many sports fans PERIOD You basically get to watch sports write about them and get paid for it PERIOD The one caveat You need sports to actually be happening in order to write about them PERIOD

Normally thats not an issue but these are not normal times PERIOD Basically everything sports related has been canceled for the past month due to the coronavirus pandemic leaving sports reporters on unsteady ground PERIOD Some are still telling players stories or breaking down old games PERIOD Others are writing about lighter topics like video games PERIOD But some like Alex Putterman of the Hartford Courant have made the full transition from covering sports to covering COVID19 PERIOD

Putterman the UConn football beat writer and a general sports reporter for the Courant said he was called into the editors office on March  and was told that he would be helping out on the coronavirus coverage for a few days PERIOD At that time Connecticut didnt have any cases and the threat still seemed somewhat low so Putterman said he didnt know how long he would be covering coronavirus for and how that would interfere with his duties in the sports department PERIOD

At that time I kind of thought maybe the next few weeks  maybe Ill just have to be balancing sports with non sports Putterman said PERIOD I was getting kind of stressed thinking about it but then less than a week later basically sports were canceled PERIOD And so from that point it became clear PERIOD I was almost kind of lucky to be on coronavirus coverage because I wasnt gonna have a whole lot to write about otherwise. now Putterman is one of the lead reporters for the Courant on the virus providing daily updates and even maintaining a Google spreadsheet with updated data on cases deaths and hospitalizations PERIOD He has also written stories about hospital preparedness COVID19 testing and the numbers and spread of the virus among different demographics in Connecticut PERIOD



Heres spreadsheet Ive been working on showing daily data on COVID19 in Connecticut overall and by county PERIOD It also has data from other states for the sake of comparing both overall and percapita numbers PERIOD

Ill try to update at the end of every day.httpst.coo1YC8N65Gc

Putterman said that despite not really leaving his apartment he is actually even busier now than he usually is covering sports PERIOD

Outside of football season in terms of being a regular sports writer there are slow days when maybe Im working on something thats a little more long term or when I dont have a whole lot to do Putterman said PERIOD With this I dont really have slow days PERIOD Every day Im working on something. for a lot of sports writers such a major transition in role would be a tough adjustment PERIOD But Putterman is a versatile reporter who does a lot outside of sports PERIOD In fact one of his roles at the Courant is covering things that are sports related but are also pertinent beyond sports such as stadium finances or the political debate of sports betting PERIOD

I kind of pride myself a little on being able to do more than just gamers and previews and stuff Putterman said PERIOD I have tried to become good at a range of things because frankly I have a lot of interests beyond sports  I actually enjoy writing about non sports things sometimes and Ive been happy to be able to report on something thats so important. even still Putterman said that it has been challenging to cover something so intense and it has put a lot more pressure on him to get things right PERIOD

Its draining emotionally Putterman said PERIOD I kind of feel the stakes of it a little higher PERIOD With sports I certainly never want to make any sort of mistake but it does feel like okay if you get the running backs yardage wrong or something like thats bad and you want to avoid it PERIOD But its not really an issue of life and death PERIOD Whereas with this stuff theres this certain extra responsibility to make sure everythings right because youre trying to inform people on this really serious issue PERIOD Its tough. putterman said the feedback he gets in emails from readers means more with a subject like the coronavirus compared to UConn football PERIOD

Putterman said he misses sports a lot PERIOD An avid baseball fan he is very disappointed that he hasnt been able to have baseball games on TV every day and play fantasy baseball PERIOD But even more so he misses his job of covering sports PERIOD



UConn announces it has canceled all spring sports

 Alex Putterman AlexPutterman March  



Theres just a certain energy to covering sports Putterman said PERIOD In terms of being in the building the crowd PERIOD Theres a certain adrenaline writing on deadline PERIOD Its fun and it sucks that we dont have that. with all his work focused on the coronavirus Putterman hasnt kept sports in his life as much as some people PERIOD He still listens to some baseball podcasts and reads an occasional fun sports story but his hunger for competition has been satisfied by an unlikely source the TV show Survivor. ive been watching old seasons and stuff and I couldnt really figure out why all of a sudden it had really captured me and why I was getting so into it Putterman said PERIOD Then I realized that its kind of like a standin for sports for me because its people competing winners and losers and stuff PERIOD I think the same part of my brain that likes sports is now using Survivor to fill that void. putterman has been doing excellent work in his new role as a COVID19 reporter but sports will hopefully come back sooner rather than later and allow him and all sports writers to get back to doing what they love PERIOD
