There is a certain problem that exists among intelligent artists who wish to have their message reach as large an audience as possible PERIOD It is a problem that stems from the fact that most people are not interested in intellectual activity as recreation PERIOD As a result the artist must make a suicidal attempt to market intelligent ideas to an often imbecilic public PERIOD Manifestations of this scenario are seen in almost every medium of popular art today PERIOD

Take for example the musician who is told by his record company to  the writer who is told by his publisher to  or the painter who is told his artwork is too politically provocative and may thus be indigestible to the public PERIOD

This course of action is not beneficial to anyone involved PERIOD The artist is being forced to compromise his art presumably for the sake of making a living PERIOD The powerbroker publisher record label etc. has put itself in the rather arrogant position of determining what is and what isnt good art strictly for the purpose of money PERIOD The public  most damningly  is subjected to perpetuating the cycle of stupidity PERIOD The public will never become more informed if the power structures that are in place do not insist on challenging it PERIOD

Joe Millionaire Queer Eye for the Straight Guy The Bachelor and American Idol the show and the recording artists all prey upon an intellectually unmotivated publics thirst for something other than genuine edification PERIOD

What would happen if it became  to be a politically informed rational intelligent human just as it is  now to rot in front of a TV What if Karl Marx Mahatma Gandhi Mary Shelley and Malcolm X became popicons What if the major media institutions of the United States decided tomorrow morning that humanity must have its intellect challenged at every avenue

This is idealism PERIOD But the point is that human beings have enormous potential and that potential is daily assaulted by entertainment outlets that assume the absolute worst of humanity PERIOD Of course those outlets do so with good reason because the majority of humans are not looking to think too deeply about anything PERIOD

True societal change will come when artists  among others  decide to stop feeding this cycle of ignorance it will depend upon individuals seeking out mentally stimulating forms of entertainment and thereby ignoring the popularized brainlessness of today PERIOD
