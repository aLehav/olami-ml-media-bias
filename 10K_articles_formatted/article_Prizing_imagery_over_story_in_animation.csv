When I talk to people about films a goto topic when I feel the social awkwardness closing in on me I find a majority of people tend to focus on the plot  whether the characters actions were believable the ending fulfilling enough or the climax sufficiently exciting PERIOD Being a film nerd I often focus on visual elements that seem to go unnoticed andor unappreciated by many of my fellow viewers or maybe just appreciated in different ways PERIOD

Dont get me wrong  I believe that film and serial TV is the most powerful platform for telling stories that weve ever seen sorry books PERIOD But film is so much more than just a storytelling medium PERIOD This idea hearkens me back to my SAC teachings at the University specifically regarding the cinema of attractions PERIOD For those who dont know and probably dont care the term cinema of attractions refers to films that appeal to viewers not for their stories but for their trick photography unique camera work and the ability to show viewers things they have never seen before PERIOD

Most often the cinema of attractions refers to a period of early film history around the turn of the century remember the old filmmaker from Hugo  he was a real guy named George Mlis who specialized in cinema of attractions during which the cinema of attractions had its glory days PERIOD Narrative cinema coexisted with its more avantgarde counterpart but as films in general became more commonplace trick photography wowed audiences less and less and the psyche of the audience shifted the story became more important that ever before PERIOD

There are a number of reasons that narrative cinema won out over the cinema of attractions PERIOD Some are obvious others more obscure studios perhaps wanted productions that were easier to massproduce PERIOD Regardless the apparent truth is that classical Hollywood narrative films are far more popular than films that appeal to us visually PERIOD But are they The top grossing film of all time is Avatar and the new Transformers film which I havent seen but by all accounts is a  junkyard come to life has already earned over a billion dollars PERIOD I cant speak to the storyline of Transformers but I will say as many have that the plot of Avatar is nothing special wed already been told the same story in Dances With Wolves Pocahontas and others PERIOD

So why was Avatar still so successful despite telling an unoriginal story Because it is classic cinema of attractions PERIOD The stunning animation and innovative 3D experience made Avatar a phenomenon because people still want to be visually amazed PERIOD Unfortunately creative editing and beautiful direction dont amaze most viewers only people like us nerds in the film section PERIOD Thats why to me the cinema of attractions lives on most vibrantly in the world of contemporary animation PERIOD And unsurprisingly Pixar leads the way PERIOD

The Little Mermaid took us under the sea Aladdin showed us a whole new world but the twodimensionality of the animation doesnt hold a candle or a Lumire if you will to Toy Story released only three years after Aladdin. computer animation offers opportunity to create entire universes separate from our own where gravity works backwards animals speak English and everybody walks around doing handstands PERIOD The leap forward in animation technology even prompted the Academy to create a specific Oscar honoring the years Best Animated Feature first awarded at the  ceremony won by Shrek if youre wondering  it beat out Monsters Inc. PERIOD

In  the Academy further recognized the power of animation by awarding Up with a nomination for Best Picture PERIOD You want to talk cinema of attractions  its a freaking house being carried by balloons On the flip side Up also tells an amazing unique story not to mention the first ten minutes would make the saddest short film of all time PERIOD Still the success of the film seems to hinge on the quirky things that can only be done through animation dogs speaking and flying planes a floating house a boy who defies racial classification were this simply the story of an old lonely man connecting with a young boisterous boy the films magic at least in the visual sense would be gone PERIOD

In  perhaps the best animated argument for the continued success of the cinema of attraction hit theaters  How to Train Your Dragon. the story of the film is nice enough but the supporting characters arent as funny as theyd like to be the real magic of the film is every scene in which Hiccup flies with his dragon Toothless PERIOD I found myself somewhat uninterested in the plot yet the flying sequences never cease to take my breath away PERIOD The followup to this film mirrors its predecessor in this way and the culmination of the trilogy in a few years will be remiss if it doesnt show some major love to the flight sequences PERIOD

Ive listed only a few examples and Im not really sure if theres an argument here or even a coherent train of thought PERIOD I suppose Im mostly trying to say that I love animation and offer a semiacademic justification for why I see more childrens films than adult films in theaters PERIOD The cinema of attractions can survive nowhere if not the big screen PERIOD Take your Transformers Id rather punt all pretense of reality and be swallowed by the separate universe of animation PERIOD

By the way watch Kung Fu Panda. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
