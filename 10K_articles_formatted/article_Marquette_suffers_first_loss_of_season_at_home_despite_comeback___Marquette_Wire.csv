3197,2023-11-04,"despite flight issues and arriving to Milwaukee the day of the game No PERIOD  UCLA had complete control for  minutes Saturday night at Fiserv Forum defeating Marquette mens basketball  PERIOD

Thought they UCLA played with terrific poise throughout the game especially the way they came out and fought early Marquette head coach Shaka Smart said PERIOD

It is the first loss of the season for the Golden Eagles at Fiserv Forum PERIOD

The same poor shooting issues to begin a game in losses against St PERIOD Bonaventure and Wisconsin resurfaced for Marquette Saturday night against UCLA PERIOD

On offense Marquette hit only . of its shots including one of its first  attempts PERIOD

It was going to have to be a phenomenal defensive game Smart said PERIOD

The Golden Eagles shooting woes early in the first half allowedUCLA to build an early  lead into the under16 media timeout PERIOD

Shortly after the timeout the Bruins continued their momentum as junior guard Jaime Jaquez Jr PERIOD hit a 3pointer in front of Smart forcing him to call a timeout PERIOD Jaquezs shot moved the UCLA run to  over a span of nearly eight minutes PERIOD

That was ateam that you cant really get in transition and thats what they did redshirt junior guard Greg Elliott said PERIOD They turned our bad shots and turnovers into offense PERIOD Really any mistake we made into offense and that is something that most good teams do. with two seconds remaining in the half redshirt firstyear guard Tyler Kolek found Elliott open in the right corner who went onto hit a 3pointer at the buzzer to send Marquette into halftime trailing  PERIOD

Despite shooting . from the field in the first  minutes the Golden Eagles finished the half on a  run PERIOD

Smart made a starting lineup change at the start of the second half as Elliott replaced firstyear guard Kam Jones PERIOD

The second half started with both teams trading basket for basket keeping the score within  points at the  mark of the half PERIOD

Elliott kept Marquette in the game shooting 3for4 from beyond the arc in the final  minutes PERIOD He finished the game with a careerhigh  points three rebounds and two assists on 7for11 shooting from the field and 6for9 from the 3point line PERIOD

I think I missed my first two shots and I came out of the game believe it was Kam Jones he told me keep shooting they are good shots so I just remained confident like I tell everybody else so I had to do it myself PERIOD And I mean I shoot in here Fiserv a lot so Im always going to be pretty comfortable here. marquette would bring the deficit within nine with  seconds left after redshirt firstyear forward Justin Lewis finished the second chance dunk PERIOD

The Golden Eagles would outscore the Bruins  in the second half but late miscues and early offensive woes proved to be too much for Marquette PERIOD

Jaquez led the way on the night for UCLA with  points  rebounds two assists a steal and a block PERIOD

Just watching them from afar I knew it was going to be challenging to defend him because he really just takes what you give him Smart said PERIOD

Marquette committed  turnovers with UCLA scoring  points off of those turnovers PERIOD

If you take those away the points off turnovers  its actually a really really good defensive game by us Smart said PERIOD 

UCLA outrebounded Marquette  on the night including getting  offensive rebounds compared to Marquettes four PERIOD

It wasnt as much being out of position there was a couple where we werent where we needed to be but I think we were there and got hands on a lot but we did not corral them we didnt bring them in Smart said PERIOD Weve got to do a better job of of hitting the other player on a block out and keeping him from getting it and then going and grabbing the ball. smart said despite Koleks shooting 2for26 shooting slump from the field over the last four games there is no thought of removing him from the starting lineup PERIOD

Absolutely not Smart said PERIOD Hes one of our best offensive players even when he doesnt make shots PERIOD Tonight wasnt his night at all from the standpoint just how he played even though he had seven assists but too many turnovers. in Saturdays game Kolek went 0for5 from the field PERIOD Smart said Koleks struggles have come from rushing those shots. saturday night was the the fourth time overall both programs matched up against each other PERIOD With the win the Bruins lead the alltime record  PERIOD

Smart said there are a lot of things we can take from this game. hopefully we can learn a lot from playing against them UCLA and for some things that they do Smart said PERIOD

Marquette wraps up nonconference play with an  record PERIOD

The Golden Eagles do not have much time to dwell on the loss heading into finals break before Saturdays BIG EAST regular season opener at Xavier PERIOD That game is scheduled for a  p.m PERIOD CST tipoff on FS1 PERIOD
