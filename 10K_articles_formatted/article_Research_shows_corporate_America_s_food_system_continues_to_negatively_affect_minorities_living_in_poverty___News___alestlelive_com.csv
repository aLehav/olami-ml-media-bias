Bobby Smith pictured here has researched extensively on the Food Justice Movement PERIOD The movement works to provide culturallyappropriate healthy food for people in underprivileged communities PERIOD

In a threepart series featuring speakers discussing the importance of food and agriculture Bobby Smith speaks on the impact food can have within Black communities PERIOD

Smith is an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign as well as the author of a book that pays tribute to his work in the Department of African American Studies PERIOD

We have to reembed the economy into society Smith said PERIOD So we have to use the economy as a way to bring power to the people. one way of bringing the economy back into society is to simply bring society to the economy PERIOD One of the many examples Smith used is grocery stores saying that they tend to be sterile places that lack personality and community PERIOD

However in lowerincome communities the opposite is true PERIOD Grocery stores are rare in some communities with farmers markets taking their place  effectively heightening the sense of belonging within a group of people PERIOD Smith uses the example of Dollar General to further his point PERIOD

Dollar General  a place that sells food clothes toys and more  is common within less welloff places PERIOD Lowerincome families do not have enough money to purchase namebrand products so they must fill their stores with items that have been produced locally PERIOD This is where farmers markets become prevalent PERIOD

Farmers markets are hangouts PERIOD Theres a band playing in the corner  you got tamales being cooked over here  its a social setting Smith said PERIOD Social settings arent for everybody PERIOD Its not inclusive for everybody PERIOD It seems to protect society from what corporate agriculture is doing. corporate agriculture as Smith said protects their products instead of the people that they are selling to PERIOD Smith says that while protected these products are killing people PERIOD

This is a matter of life and death PERIOD Dont eat highly processed foods because your body will shut down and attack itself and be diseased PERIOD Deceased Smith said PERIOD

Corporate agriculture often has such a grip on smaller communities because their food is poorly made and accessible such as drivethrus and fast food PERIOD However this food is not healthy PERIOD This food is not filling and only forces someone to continue to eat more lowquality food to survive off a minimal amount of nutrients PERIOD

Its willful ignorance Smith said PERIOD People know people are hungry but its their problem. a lot of them know whats going on but turn a blind eye to it anyway. in order to fix this issue Smith suggested that we begin to work within our communities at these food marketplaces to begin the power shift PERIOD

I think it takes people spreading the message Smith said PERIOD These kinds of programs and conversations empower people PERIOD Whats important about these kinds of programs is it shows people they are not alone in this PERIOD So during this talk we had people who were doing one thing talking to folks who were doing another thing  living in the same community even though they never talk to each other PERIOD I think thats important because you build collective power. smith pushes the point that power lies within the people PERIOD He adamently believes that communities have the power to change their state of living PERIOD

I think that its going to have to impact those who are in power PERIOD Maybe it should be on the local ballot like on local county boards PERIOD Thats where the real work happens is at the local level Smith said PERIOD

One of the more individualcentered solutions on the issue of cutting heavily processed foods out of communities is the creation of aquaponic systems PERIOD Yashika Mckay was an attendee at the Rehearsing Black Food Futures speech and is the founder of a selfsustaining aquaponics system located in the St PERIOD Louis area PERIOD

Aquaponics is where you use fish waste to grow food Mckay said PERIOD That way if you know what your fish are eating then you know what your food contains. mckay describes this process as the first way to grow truly clean food with all of the aspects of growth within the farmers control PERIOD This limits the amount of damaging chemicals that make their way into the food and assists in creating healthier products and therefore healthier people PERIOD

Im thinking from the outside PERIOD I want to know what other people are going to think PERIOD I just want people to understand how the food system works and once we understand how it works we can begin to organize to resist it to work within it or use it for our benefit Smith said PERIOD
