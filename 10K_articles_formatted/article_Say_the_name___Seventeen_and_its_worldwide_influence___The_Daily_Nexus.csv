Another element that sets Seventeen apart from other Kpop groups is that they produce their own music and dance choreography PERIOD As Kpop idols usually expect a fast turnaround regarding the production of music albums and music videos most groups have producers that produce music for them to ensure comebacks happen frequently PERIOD However Seventeen selfproduces most of their music with vocalist Lee Jihoon better known as Woozi creating and composing many of their famous tracks such as HIT and WORLD. additionally members Hansol Vernon Chwe and Jeon Wonwoo also aid in lyric writing creating most of the rap components in their songs PERIOD Not only does Seventeen write and compose most of their discography they also choreograph most of their dances for their live performances PERIOD Main dancer Kwon Soonyoung more famously known as Hoshi choreographed the dance routines for many of the groups songs such as Dont Wanna Cry with this dance practice video amassing  million views PERIOD Although their dances are very difficult Seventeen is able to showcase its synchronization in its dance moves strengthening its popularity as a group that dances as one PERIOD

Seventeen established itself as a versatile force in the Kpop industry by maximizing the talents of all  members PERIOD Seventeen not only promotes itself as a group but they also perform in three separate units a hiphop unit a vocal unit and a performance dance unit PERIOD By taking full advantage of these subunits Seventeen is once again able to create content and songs unique only to them PERIOD

Seventeen has not only become a very popular Kpop phenomenon but also helped open the door for other Kpop groups to become a worldwide phenomenon as well PERIOD Seventeen has done many collaborations with other Kpop groups including performing on variety shows with groups ENHYPEN and Le Sserafim PERIOD
