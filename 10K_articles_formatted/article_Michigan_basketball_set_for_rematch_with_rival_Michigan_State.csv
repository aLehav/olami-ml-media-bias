Walking into the press conference after defeating rival Michigan State Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico had an added glint in her eyes PERIOD

It wasnt because the 15point win was a big upset or a win over a ranked opponent  her team was favored by a large margin PERIOD It was simply because the rivalry between the Wolverines and the Spartans means a lot to Barnes Arico her team and womens basketball PERIOD

This game is really special Barnes Arico said Jan PERIOD  after the win PERIOD It means a ton for both programs I think it means a ton for our state to have  a significant amount of fans to come out and celebrate the state of Michigan and womens basketball. sunday the Wolverines look to secure the meaningful rivalry win once again PERIOD

No PERIOD  Michigan was pleased with its performance in the showdown last month which saw the Wolverines dominate both sides of the 3point battle handily win the turnover contest and make critical hustle plays PERIOD On the other side however Michigan State felt its performance left a lot to be desired PERIOD

The Spartans shot just  from the floor significantly below their thenaverage  PERIOD They also went a damning 3of19 from deep that took them out of the game PERIOD Uncharacteristically high turnovers  including five firstquarter travels  further compounded their problems PERIOD

They shot it well from the perimeter and we didnt Michigan State coach Suzy Merchant  who wont be coaching Sunday after being released from the hospital earlier this week  said Jan PERIOD  PERIOD And usually thats kind of our thing is that we space the floor we get by people we penetrate we kick we do some things and we have people that can shoot and it just didnt go in PERIOD And we had too many turnovers in the first half which I thought contributed to some frustration too. the Spartans are unlikely to make many of those mistakes the second time around PERIOD They rank ninth in the nation in turnover margin and will be looking to rectify those uncharacteristic giveaways in their second matchup against their instate rivals PERIOD

Michigan State will be the first opponent Michigan plays for a second time this season as it enters the second half of conference play and it will have to do so at the hostile Breslin Center PERIOD

Despite the Spartans poor conference record they boast strong results at home PERIOD In December Michigan State handed No PERIOD  Indiana what is still its only loss of the season PERIOD And less than three weeks ago the Spartans took No PERIOD  Iowa into overtime before ultimately falling short of yet another upset PERIOD

Leaving East Lansing Sunday with a series sweep is easier said than done PERIOD And in a rivalry game like this the Wolverines have always known that they will need to bring their all PERIOD

Its just going to be a 40minute battle graduate forward Emily Kiser said Jan PERIOD  PERIOD No matter how each team plays youre gonna play the best basketball you can against your instate rival. last time out Michigan played some of its most balanced basketball PERIOD This time it might have to do so without sophomore guard Laila Phelia the teams leading scorer who is daytoday with a lower leg injury PERIOD Michigan State on the other hand didnt deliver to nearly the extent it wanted to PERIOD When Crisler Center broke into little sister chants in the final minute of play the Spartans already knew they hadnt executed their game plan PERIOD Thats a mistake they firmly believe theyll be able to rectify PERIOD

Control the controllables Merchant said PERIOD One of the things that we had to do was knock down shots from the arc PERIOD That was just something we had to be able to do against this defense the way they play PERIOD Its what we knew going in PERIOD  So our turnovers and our three ball I thought were the two things that really needed to be better today. michigan State hopes to perform up to its standards on Sunday PERIOD If the Spartans can do that the game could look a lot different the second time around PERIOD

But if the Wolverines can deliver another stifling showing theyll likely exit the court flashing those same smiles  this time in East Lansing PERIOD
