Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn argues a call with the referee during an NCAA college football game between Georgia and Auburn Saturday Nov PERIOD   in Auburn Ala PERIOD PhotoJoshua L PERIOD Jones joshjonesphotoyahoo.com

Coming into last season Auburn football had a lot of reasons to be optimistic PERIOD

Gus Malzahn was entering his third season as head coach PERIOD The Tigers were only two years removed from a BCS National Championship game appearance and they had reeled in consecutive top10 recruiting classes which included one of the top national recruits DE Byron Cowart.Many pundits believed Auburn would be Alabamas toughest competition for the SEC west title and it came into the season ranked as the No PERIOD  college football team in the country PERIOD

But it wasnt meant to be for Malzahns squad PERIOD Uninspired quarterback play from starter Jeremy Johnson and replacement Sean White held back an Auburn offense that was forced to settle for field goals too often in  PERIOD Despite lofty expectations it managed just a  regular season record although the Tigers did take out Memphis in the Birmingham Bowl PERIOD

This year Auburn has a much higher mountain to climb in terms of convincing the rest of the SEC that it can compete in one of college footballs most competitive conferences PERIOD The questions start at the quarterback position once again an area the Tigers did not do much to address in the offseason PERIOD

Johnson is the incumbent starter and has the strongest arm on the team but his touchdowntointerception ratio of just  from a year ago leaves much to be desired PERIOD Whites passing was less erratic but he threw for only one score on  attempts last year PERIOD The team also added junior college transfer John Franklin III to the roster PERIOD The former East Mississippi Community College player is an exciting dualthreat prospect but his production thus far has come against competition far inferior to what hell see in the rugged SEC west PERIOD

Its a mystery who will be behind center for the Tigers in  but the passing game will have to improve if Auburn wants to take a step forward from last season PERIOD

Things wont be easy for whoever that starter is as Auburns only star receiver from a year ago Ricardo Louis left the school to join the NFL PERIOD The team is left with Marcus Davis Jason Smith and Tony Stevens as its starters at wide receiver PERIOD The three upperclassmen combined for only  yards in  about  yards shy of the mark Louis set by himself PERIOD The Tigers also lose  yards of receiving production from running backs Roc Thomson who is transferring to Jacksonville State and Peyton Barber who is now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers PERIOD

Perhaps the one prospective bright spot on Auburns offense this year is the return of running back Jovon Robinson PERIOD Robinson had a strong finish to the Tigers  campaign going for  yards or more in five of the teams final six games PERIOD Auburn has had a 1000yard rusher in each of the past seven seasons which is the longest streak the SEC has ever seen PERIOD With not much competition for Robinson in the backfield this year it is a streak that is likely to continue PERIOD

On defense Auburn looks to be much more sound PERIOD Although the Tigers did not fare well last year finishing ninth in total defense in the SEC they have the players to make vast improvements on the defensive side of the ball PERIOD They return stars Carl Lawson and Montravius Adams on the defensive line and although Cowart was disappointing in his rookie season 2015s No PERIOD  national recruit will look to improve in his sophomore year PERIOD Auburn also signed DT Derrick Brown this year the top recruit in the state of Georgia PERIOD With all that compiled talent Auburns defensive line has the opportunity to be one of the most dominant units in college football PERIOD

Linebacker will be a more troubling position to account for as the team loses three starters from last year PERIOD Tre Williams is the only returning player who has logged significant snaps for the Tigers but graduate transfer from Illinois T.J PERIOD Neal brings needed experience to the middle of Auburns defense PERIOD

The teams secondary has a good chance to take a big step forward in  PERIOD Paramount to the Tigers pass defense is budding star cornerback Carlton Davis PERIOD Davis is coming off a rookie season in which he made  tackles to go along with eight pass breakups and three interceptions PERIOD His play was good enough to garner a selection to the AllSEC Freshman team and he will be Auburns top corner for at least the next two years. the team also returns former Georgia standout Tray Mathews and enforcer Rudy Ford PERIOD This pair of experienced safeties should prevent teams from going over the top of the Tiger defense PERIOD

The biggest question mark on the defensive side of the ball for Auburn is the coordinator Kevin Steele PERIOD He is the third defensive coordinator the Tigers have seen in as many years and his predecessors have not had much success with similarly talented squads PERIOD If Steele can manage this unit better than Ellis Johnson and Will Muschamp did before him Auburn should be able to hang in with virtually any other team in the country defensively PERIOD

After a disappointing  in which the Auburn Tigers finished just  Malzahn has a lot of questions to answer PERIOD Given the talent on the teams roster and the multiple top10 recruiting classes mediocre seasons are simply no longer acceptable PERIOD The current quarterback situation throws an SEC title berth this year into serious doubt PERIOD However Auburns defensive talents particularly along the defensive line should be strong enough to grant the team at least one or two more wins than it had last year PERIOD
