For the first time in three years the Mavericks are  PERIOD This weekend UNO tallied impressive wins over Colorado StatePueblo  and Montana StateBillings  at the Thanksgiving Classic in the Sapp Fieldhouse.Friday nights game was dominated by the Mavs out of the gate starting with senior forward Jerry Bennett PERIOD Bennett controlled the paint on Friday night nearly achieving a doubledouble by half time PERIOD

After being sidelined at the beginning of the season due to injuries Bennett finished the first game of his senior season with his first doubledouble as a Maverick PERIOD Bennett ended the game with  points and  rebounds as the visiting Thunderwolves had no answer for the senior PERIOD

I was so anxious to be out there this game Bennett said PERIOD My role is to grab rebounds and be a big presence in the post. michael Jenkins who has been utterly unstoppable during the beginning of this season had  points in the game PERIOD Jenkins who is now playing the wing position for the Mavericks appears to have the ability to get to the basket anytime he wants PERIOD

It feels really good its my natural position some people say Jenkins said PERIOD Im skinny but I like the contact. this has certainly been proven true early this season as Jenkins is shooting an average of eight free throws per game PERIOD

Andrew Bridger scored  in the game while his teammates Mitch Albers and Justin Peterson each scored  PERIOD UNO dominated the game for the most part as their 20point lead never seemed within reach for the Thunderwolves PERIOD Ty Mctyler led CSUP with  points in the game PERIOD

In Saturday nights matchup UNO broke a school record hitting an unbelievable  threepointers as the Mavs blew out Montana StateBillings  PERIOD The mark was two better than the Zac Robinsondriven record that was set last season PERIOD The Mavs shot  percent from behind the threepoint arc for the game PERIOD By the end of the game eight members of this team had made at least one three point basket PERIOD

UNO also dominated the glass on the night outrebounding the Yellowjackets  PERIOD  Matt Newman and Nate Owen both flirted with a tripledouble on Saturday night recording nine points  rebounds and seven assists each PERIOD

True freshman Mitch Albers connected on six of seven from beyond the arc in the game and led the Mavericks in scoring with  points PERIOD

UNOs tough fullcourt press consistently forced Montana State to turn the ball over and the Mavericks got off to an early lead PERIOD After seven minutes the score was  and the Mavericks kept their foot on the gas pedal PERIOD At halftime the score was  and the Mavs continued to press on toward the 57point blowout PERIOD

The teams  was the thirdhighest point total in a single game in school history PERIOD  It was the first time since  that UNO has scored more than  points PERIOD

This new and improved Maverick basketball team has become more and more fun to watch each time they play the game PERIOD  With the intelligent fastpaced play of coach Derrin Hansen the UNO Mavericks have begun to play an exciting pace of basketball PERIOD

The new additions have given the team a versatility that has yet to be contained this season PERIOD With all five players on the floor contributing to the offense there is no telling how far this team will go PERIOD The Mavericks have been playing team ball not only on offense but also on defense something that has definitely produced results here in the early going PERIOD

The Mavericks will try to continue their win streak this upcoming weekend and will have to do it away from home PERIOD They will face Missouri Western on Friday at  p.m PERIOD in St PERIOD Joseph Mo. then Northwest Missouri State on Saturday at  p.m PERIOD in Maryville Mo PERIOD
