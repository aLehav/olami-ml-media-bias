Lets be honest PERIOD You only really wear a fraction of the clothes you own PERIOD When youre strapped for time or in the middle of a fashion crisis your favorite items extend their sleeves and pant legs to you promising a day of comfortable banality free of any unforeseen fashion glitches PERIOD As handy as these goto outfits are theyre about as exciting as that leftover spaghetti in the back of your fridge PERIOD

So whats in the rest of your closet Most likely a plethora of untapped potential Items you bought on double clearance gifts from Auntie Doreen impulse purchases at SPCA and daring buys outside of your usual fashion comfort zone PERIOD So utilize them

I recently found myself succumbing to the tempting lures of my favorite clothing items PERIOD My jeans lobbying I imagine my jeans to have a husky sort of voice Oh honey do I know how to hug your body and boy do I make your ass look good Frazzled by too many units and the gaping hole where my second major should be I was no match for their seductive offers PERIOD For the first few days I lived in bliss snuggling into my sweatshirts and wiggling my slippersocked toes inside my moccasins PERIOD Bundled in my cocoon of cozy and propped up in a Shields library chair I would watch the fashionable boys and girls of Davis strut by their boots clicking importantly on the library linoleum and their scarves mysteriously fluttering in the windless indoors PERIOD

I could no longer pretend that I would rather live my life swaddled in sweatshirt material looking like I rolled out of an intense allnight finals study session when the potential to look original put together and classy was lying no farther than inside my closet curtains PERIOD Further guilted by the undeniable expert Miss Coco Chanel who said I dont understand how a woman can leave the house without fixing herself up a little  if only out of politeness I resigned to only wear my sweats inside the comfortable familiars would be an utter last resort a white flag of fashion defeat PERIOD

To create a wall between me and the lures of the regulars I composed a challenge for myself PERIOD I would not under any condition allow myself to wear the same pantshirt combination on a school day PERIOD I understand that for most people this challenge is simply not plausible but my closet extends beyond my closet it goes under my bed into my dresser onto shelves and even to the coat closet downstairs PERIOD To put it simply I have a lot of clothes PERIOD

This was easy at first I had a few good outfits on file and I loved walking around campus feeling put together and back up to my usual fashion par PERIOD Soon however I found myself forced to explore the dark and cobwebbed areas of my closet PERIOD Here were the distant cousins the ugly stepchildren and weird uncle Titos of my wardrobe and there was I finally ready to fully embrace them PERIOD No doubt it was hard to find a way to work some of these items into my everyday school outfits bright pink legwarmers but I approached each challenge with zeal and savored every victory PERIOD I began keeping a fashion journal of what I wore every day to better keep track of what combinations I had already used and to make notes about what was particularly successful and what needed some rethinking PERIOD

If you need a little help utilizing your wardrobe identify a neglected clothing item and try to assemble three outfits around it PERIOD If its an awkward dress you might try belting it adding tights or changing the footwear PERIOD Dont be afraid to be bold Create unexpected color print and texture combinations  you might be surprised at what works PERIOD If youre uncomfortable sporting bolder combos on campus for all your peers to see try strutting your new stuff on the streets of Davis PERIOD The Farmers Market downtown on Saturdays is always a great place to test the waters as it usually draws some crazy hippies who will always one up you on the experimental fashion scale PERIOD And if some of the items in your closet are past salvation purge them and make room for the new But dont just throw them away donate them to SPCA

I am proud to say that I am still trekking on PERIOD No pantsshirt combo has been repeated yet and my painfully unique teal and gold poodle sweater finally got its day in the sun PERIOD So go dig through your closet and challenge yourself to find a way to wear the things you so often neglect PERIOD
