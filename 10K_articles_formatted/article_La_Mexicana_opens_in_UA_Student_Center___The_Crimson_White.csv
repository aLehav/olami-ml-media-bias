La Mexicana a local restaurantturnedfood truck is this semesters Bama Dining Flip Kitchen occupant PERIOD

Located inside the UA Student Center beside Blenz Bowl La Mexicana serves a variety of menu options including authentic tacos with addon toppings stuffed burritos and tortilla chips with white queso PERIOD

Bama Dinings Flip Kitchen gives restaurants a chance to temporarily occupy a space in the UA Student Centers food court PERIOD Last semester Cheese Louise occupied the space PERIOD

We found there to be value in switching more often because there are different types of food that were not being offered in the food court said Bruce McVeagh the resident district manager for Aramark the contracted food service provider for Bama Dining PERIOD This gives a small business owner a chance to test out what it would be like to do a higher volume. kristina Patridge the director of UA dining services referenced the success of Blenz Bowls a company founded by two UA alumni as the reason why she believes Flip Kitchen will help small businesses PERIOD

Blenz Bowls started as a food truck on campus and now has a permanent space in the UA Student Center PERIOD The company currently has both food trucks and permanent locations at Ole Miss the University of Tennessee and the University of South Florida in addition to The University of Alabama PERIOD

McVeagh said a local small business owner wanted to turn his restaurant La Mexicana into a food truck so he asked to join the Bama Dining food truck program PERIOD After a tedious process to be accepted into the program La Mexicana drove its new food truck on campus in  PERIOD

The Bama Dining food truck program started in  due to requests from students to have food trucks on campus PERIOD To be approved for the program business owners must submit health scores appropriate insurance and various other paperwork to UA Risk Management PERIOD

Food trucks in the program pay a semesterly rent and commision on dining dollar sales PERIOD They have 24hour access to campus and over  different oncampus locations to choose to park the vehicles PERIOD

The businesses submit a location schedule by Friday for the next week PERIOD This schedule is posted at the beginning of the week on the Bama Dining website and its social media accounts PERIOD

UA Student Center Director Darrien Simmons said he often walks through the UA Student Center food court and eats at the different restaurants PERIOD He speaks with students and listens to their opinions on the service PERIOD

After La Mexicanas opening Simmons stood in line at the restaurant listened to students orders and ordered the most popular items PERIOD

Simmons said the Flip Kitchen program gives students a variety of options PERIOD

It gives students something to look forward to Simmons said PERIOD Its a surprise PERIOD The students dont know whats going in there. mcVeagh Patridge and Simmons ask for students to share their opinions of oncampus food services with Bama Dining through their website or through their student forum PERIOD

We listen intently on what is being said McVeagh said PERIOD We ask a lot of questions to try to find out what everyone would really like to have PERIOD Whenever flavors menus and palettes change so do we. questions Email the Culture desk at emailprotected PERIOD
