A tradition formed over  years ago continues to stay alive with the hard work and direction of members of the Performing Arts House PERIOD

The Underground is a cabaret style event where any student can come and perform something they love to do said Zoe Murphy a junior theater arts and accounting major PERIOD

Students who participate in the Underground often sing dance share poetry or perform comedy acts PERIOD

Murphy explained there is also an improv club that does an improv game at every Underground PERIOD

PA house members senior Cierra Clark junior Dallas Williams sophomore Jack Strub sophomore Jared Campbell and Murphy put a lot of work into making the Underground a great experience for everyone PERIOD

We do a lot of planning for the Underground Campbell said PERIOD

Student performances take up most of the event but the PA house likes to add additional elements to the show PERIOD

We like to have some kind of skit movie or song PERIOD We also figure out if there will be a theme and plan a skit around the theme Campbell said PERIOD

Their most popular themes include a Halloween costume contest ugly Christmas sweater contest and auction for dates with house members as a fundraiser for their philanthropy Run DSM PERIOD

They also work hard to keep their social media up to date PERIOD Clark makes posts for their Facebook page and Strub takes photos of the group and photoshops their heads onto posters promoting the next Underground PERIOD

The Underground is typically hosted in Barnum Studio theater or Pote Theater when the crowd exceeds over  students PERIOD Murphy said that she has seen crowds as large as  students who came to watch anywhere from eight to  students express themselves through their craft PERIOD

The Underground is usually once a month on a Friday night but when prospective students are on campus for a visit the Underground happens Thursday night PERIOD

Freshman elementary education major Faithyna Leonard was once one of these prospective students and said participating in the Underground helped weigh in her decision to go to Simpson because it allowed me to see a place where people were allowed to express themselves freely. since her first performance at the Underground Leonard has attended almost every Underground this year and performed an original slam poem about sexual assault PERIOD As a survivor Leonard thought the Underground would be the perfect place to share her thoughts because its a safe environment PERIOD

I felt safe and it made a great impact in my life Leonard said PERIOD

Members of the PA house encourage anyone who has a talent they would like to share to just do it PERIOD

Its a very encouraging and constructive environment Williams said PERIOD Its satisfying to do something you love in front of people who respect appreciate and understand your passion for what you do. anyone who is nervous about performing is encouraged to bring their friends for support PERIOD

The next Underground is scheduled for March PERIOD If students are interested in performing at the Underground they can reach out to a house member PERIOD Anyone who asks to perform will normally be put in the show unless it is already full PERIOD Then theyll be moved to the next show PERIOD
