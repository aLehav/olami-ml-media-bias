Every individual has their own perception of what their final loss of childhood and final fleeting moments of youth are PERIOD

Some think its turning  or the loss of their virginity PERIOD For others its moving out PERIOD

For me it was realizing that in approximately eight months I will be graduating college and like many others I have absolutely no clue what I want to do with my life PERIOD

When we were young we wanted to be princesses rockstars rocket scientists the president and so on  my plan was to be all of the above  but fast forward a decade Im expected to limit myself to just one major PERIOD

My requirements for a major were simple no math and one that allowed me to travel PERIOD  So what seemed like a random game of roulette I landed on public relations and off I went  leaving my home state with my clothes in a trash bag and a hopeful longing to find my passion PERIOD

Guess what I never did PERIOD

I love college PERIOD I love my friends classes and environment but I never really found the one thing most students come here to find to become properly equipped with the skills to succeed in the workforce and most importantly to find a way to support ourselves in one of the most expensive cities in the United States PERIOD

For a lucky few their path is set PERIOD

Premed Next step is medical school PERIOD Want to be a lawyer Next step is law school PERIOD Chose a random major and got jipped out of a year and a half of school due to the pandemic Well now seems like a good time to panic PERIOD

I know I shouldnt panic PERIOD We are all ambitious and passionate longing to make something of ourselves but there is something so intimidating about knowing I am just as lost about what I want to do with my life as I was the day I graduated high school PERIOD The difference is reality is flying at me fast PERIOD

Its frustrating that all my life my parents and teachers have told me college is where youll find your passion or college is where it will all fall into place but it just never really clicked for me PERIOD

Luckily since this topic has been on my mind for a while now I have gained some advice along the way by expressing my concern to just about anyone who will listen PERIOD

Heres what Ive learned

You have time PERIOD

Its okay not knowing what you want PERIOD Life is a game of trial and error and as students theres always room and time for error PERIOD

Network

Meet as many people as you can PERIOD If Ive learned anything throughout college its that connections will get you farther than any test score or GPA will ever get you PERIOD

Get an internship PERIOD

So many students that I have met throughout my college experience ended up working in a company that they had interned with PERIOD

Give yourself grace PERIOD

If youre anything like me you have the immense pressure on your shoulders  how to make your family proud how to make yourself proud how to make it work in the real world and how to be financially stable and independent PERIOD

This is normal PERIOD

Look around you PERIOD I can almost guarantee that the guy sitting right next to you with his massive textbook and copious notes who seems to be the next Steve Jobs is just as lost as you PERIOD

We all go through this and at the end of the day it will work out PERIOD Were all in this together PERIOD Take a deep breath work hard and keep an open mind PERIOD Your great job opportunity could be just around the corner PERIOD
