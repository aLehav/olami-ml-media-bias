Associated Students is holding a special election featuring online voting Dec PERIOD  and  to redistribute money once earmarked for financial aid PERIOD

On the ballot students will vote whether or not to transfer money currently funding Financial Aid workstudy programs to a new student retention center PERIOD

This money is currently being used to fund  student jobs on campus Director of Financial Aid Linda Clemons said PERIOD Youre not going to find a replacement for these jobs.The board voted unanimously in favor of this referendum Oct PERIOD  allowing it to be on the ballot PERIOD However two weeks later at the next meeting half of the board voted to revisit the decision PERIOD

I support the need to improve retention rates on campus and I think the retention center is a very good idea PERIOD But after our initial decision questions began to surface about how transferring this money could affect students and the overall plan of the how the money will be spent Director of Education Nicole Croly said PERIOD

Vice President of Finance James Shelby claims that student jobs will not be lost by the creation of the retention center and the idea that student jobs will be lost is an act of misinformation from people within the university PERIOD

The retention center will be creating student jobs through offering various lab assistant and mentoring positions Shelby said PERIOD The one thing that we really dont want is to lose student jobs. despite ASIs plan for the retention center is still in the concept phase Shelby said PERIOD

If the referendum passes the money transferred will not go towards actually constructing a facility PERIOD Instead it will be used to hire a consultant to find out if it is even feasible to build and if it something Sac State students really want PERIOD

Shelby also said the money may go toward hiring a program adviser to run the program and develop retention programs PERIOD

Student ASI fees are nearly 

In the past ASI set aside onethird of student ASI fees to Financial Aid PERIOD This past March the CSU Board of Trustees revised that ruling in Executive Order  allowing the money to be redistributed by ASI PERIOD

The amount translated to roughly  this past year of which Financial Aid redirected  back to ASI to cover campus work programs PERIOD

Aside from the issue of taking money away from Financial Aid there seems to be a growing concern about the ambiguity over the services the retention center will include PERIOD

Five days before the election ASI will begin circulating pamphlets on campus informing students that the new center will include a 24hour computer lab tutoring and mentoring programs study lounges and student jobs for those looking to get involved PERIOD

Lou Camera director of student activities said students can already find most of these services on campus PERIOD

The nearly completed Academic Information Resource Center behind the library already boasts a 24hour computer lab study lounges and more student job offerings when it opens next spring PERIOD

If students want tutoring help services such as the Faculty Student Mentor Program in Lassen Hall or Learning Communities which helps students form social and academic networks with professors and other students are two more options Camera said PERIOD

Students also have the option to visit their academic departments to learn about what kind of peer to peer and mentoring services are offered PERIOD

I dont know if starting a new program and erecting a new facility on campus is the best use for that money Camera said PERIOD

Shelby cites software as major benefit

Shelby believes the center may have other advantages PERIOD

What I would like to see later on is a place for students to be able to use LSAT software without having to purchase the software with Student Educational Leadership grants Shelby said PERIOD

He said having this software available in computer labs could be used to help students prepare for standardized graduate exams like the LSAT GRE and the GMAT PERIOD

This would be an added benefit of being part of the alumni program Shelby added PERIOD

But the minutes from the board meeting on Oct PERIOD  show no evidence these services were ever considered PERIOD

When the referendum was unanimously passed Lori Varlotta student affairs designee questioned the possibility of combining existing strategies to form a more effective program PERIOD

According to the minutes Shelby said This referendum is just to put it on the ballot not determine what services will be included PERIOD Passage of this referendum would just provide a pot of money to be used for the program to be determined later. referendum may lack longterm perspective

Camera said that the retention referendum as been dealt with in a very myopic approach neglecting any longterm perspective PERIOD

I would like to see us discuss this matter further before rushing into making such a quick decision Camera said PERIOD

Executive Order  actually offers three options PERIOD

The money can be left alone and continue funding workstudy programs in Financial Aid PERIOD It can be refunded to the students equaling about five dollars back to every student on campus or it can be shifted to other purposes which is what may happen PERIOD

The minutes from Oct PERIOD  show no evidence that options one and two were ever presented to the board by the referendums authors President Joshua Wood Vice President of Academic Affairs Luke Wood and Shelby PERIOD

We felt that such a small refund the students would be receiving it would be more beneficial to use the money elsewhere and for better purposes Shelby said PERIOD

But Camera disagrees and said everyone should have been aware of all the options from the start PERIOD

If it means refunding the students five dollars in order to avoid a hasty decision then thats what should be done Camera said PERIOD

Wood promises cash for work programs

Josh Wood made a verbal promise that the  would still be set aside for campus work programs while the rest would go towards the new center PERIOD

Some board members said that as detailed as the referendum may be it lacks any qualifying language stating that money must still be set aside for those programs PERIOD

Weve used that money to pay for employees of our campus work programs for the past few years said Sophia Albov director of natural sciences and mathematics PERIOD I only worry that the language currently in the referendum is too ambiguous for future ASI Board members to recognize. the issue of student graduation rates and existing retention programs is the hot topic leading into the special online election PERIOD

Out of the roughly  students attending Sacramento State only  percent graduate PERIOD Existing retention programs have an  percent graduation rate but only  percent of students participate in such programs PERIOD

ASI hopes that transferring money it currently provides to Financial Aid to help fund its plan for a new retention center will help increase these statistics PERIOD

With an  percent graduation rate Camera believes that existing programs are working in which case it becomes an issue about why students are not taking advantage of them PERIOD

I would like to know where our current retention system is not working Camera said PERIOD

Camera discussed the possibility that lack of funding and budget cuts may have resulted in students being turned away due to the lack of resources and staff available PERIOD

But Camera believes it would be cheaper in the long run to work with improving existing programs than creating new facilities altogether PERIOD

There were a bunch of programs cut last year because of the tight budget Camera said PERIOD Is it the best decision to spend money on a new program thats already being provided Perhaps we need to evaluate what programs could really use that money. if the referendum passes it does not mean the funds will immediately be transferred PERIOD Instead the issue will be presented to the Student Fee Advisory Committee PERIOD

At this stage the committee examines how the transfer will affect the universitys budget Financial Aid and ASI PERIOD Based on its analysis the committee will present a recommendation to Sac State President Alexander Gonzalez whether or not this transfer of funds is a fiscally wise decision PERIOD

Gonzalez retains final say over any transfer

Gonzalez will then make a decision based on the committees recommendation and the students vote whether or not to transfer the money which could happen as soon as next fall PERIOD

A total of nine members are on the Student Fee Advisory Committee five of which are ASI executive board members who voted in favor of the referendum.Three of the five are Shelby and the Wood brothers PERIOD

ASI has been accepting opposing arguments on the measure with today being the last day to submit arguments PERIOD

Patricia Worley the executive director of ASI said the reason for such a close deadline is that the board needs to have received all opposing views  days before the election so that they can be included in a voter pamphlet to inform students PERIOD

Official forum has never been required

Members of the board including Croly feel that students did not have enough time to learn about the issues involved and that the lack of board meetings in the weeks leading up to the election does not give students the opportunity to voice their opinions PERIOD

As far as I know there is no rule in the bylaws that calls for an open forum to voice opposition Worley said PERIOD But there has always been a call for opposition to any measure. the ASI money that goes to financial aid will be gone PERIOD All of it will go into the retention center PERIOD The money is for workstudy and will be gone unless another organization is able to somehow come up with the money Vice President of Student Affairs Shirley Uplinger said PERIOD

Clemons believes students need to be fully informed of the consequences and make the decision based on which one will help more students PERIOD

We have to ask ourselves Will this new center help more than  students and do we have enough information to answer that question Clemons said PERIOD

Your donation will support the student journalists of Sacramento State University PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
