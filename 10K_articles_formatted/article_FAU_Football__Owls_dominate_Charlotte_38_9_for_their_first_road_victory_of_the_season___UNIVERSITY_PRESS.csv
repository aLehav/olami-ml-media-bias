Bryce Totz Staff WriterOctober  

Just hours after accepting an offer to join the American Athletic Conference AAC the Florida Atlantic Owls   CUSA defeated the University of Charlotte   CUSA  in Charlotte N.C PERIOD This was the first road win for the Owls this season PERIOD

Charlotte kept the game close through the first half of the game PERIOD

The game was sloppy at first as Charlotte missed a 44yard field goal attempt on their opening drive and FAU fumbled the ball on the 49ers 20yard line PERIOD

We still put the ball on the ground too much and that drove me crazy head coach Willie Taggart said PERIOD

Following the fumble Charlotte had a 75yard drive that resulted in a 23yard field goal PERIOD

The Owls responded with a 12play touchdown drive to give them a  lead PERIOD Graduate quarterback NKosi Perry completed an eightyard pass to graduate wide receiver T.J PERIOD Chase in the corner of the endzone PERIOD

On the next possession Charlotte fumbled the ball and senior inside linebacker Caliph Brice recovered it PERIOD Brice went on to finish with ten tackles seven solo in the win PERIOD

I try to perform every game said Brice PERIOD This game was extra special because I had about  family members here. fAU did not capitalize on the turnover though as they had to punt for the first time of the night PERIOD

That punt led to Charlottes only touchdown PERIOD That score came on an 88yard drive that took  and  plays PERIOD

In the second half the Owls went on to score  unanswered points including a  touchdown drive to open the third quarter PERIOD Redshirt sophomore Johnny Ford caught a pass from Perry for  yards PERIOD

Ford lost a family member earlier in the week and was questionable to play but he decided to play to put a smile on the faces of his relatives watching PERIOD

All of this was for them Ford said PERIOD It wasnt even for me because I wasnt supposed to play this week. fAU scored again on their next drive as junior running back Malcolm Davidson carried the ball for nine yards to the endzone PERIOD

They had to punt on their next possession but quickly got the ball back as redshirt junior Korel Smith intercepted a pass from redshirt senior quarterback Chris Reynolds PERIOD

On the ensuing possession the Owls scored on one play PERIOD Perry threw a 30yard pass to redshirt junior Brandon Robinson PERIOD

Perry went on to finish with  yards and three touchdowns on nine completions PERIOD He also led the team in carries with  PERIOD

On Charlottes next possession Reynolds threw another interception this time to redshirt junior safety Ahman Ross PERIOD This was Ross first career interception and he immediately gave the ball to his mother who was in the stands PERIOD

Ross told me before the game he was going to get one Taggart said PERIOD It was great to see him go get it and give it to his mom. that interception led to a 27yard field goal from redshirt junior kicker Aaron Shahriari PERIOD

The FAU defense forced a turnover on downs on the next possession and the offense capitalized with a twoplay 61yard touchdown PERIOD

Ford ran for  yards on the first play and finished it with a oneyard touchdown run PERIOD He credited the offensive line with opening holes for him to be able to get into Charlottes secondary PERIOD He led the team in rushing yards with  on eight carries PERIOD

FAU plays its next game against the University of Texas at El Paso UTEP on Oct PERIOD  in Boca Raton PERIOD That game is scheduled for  p.m PERIOD and will be broadcast on ESPN PERIOD
