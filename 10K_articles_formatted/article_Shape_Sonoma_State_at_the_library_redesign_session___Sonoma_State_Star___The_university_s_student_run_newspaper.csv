9349,2020-02-03,"sonoma State University is encouraging students and staff to bring their ideas to the table and will be hosting library design sessions to learn what the campus community wants from the University Library redesign PERIOD On Feb PERIOD  and  the architect firm Noll  Tam who lead the redesign of the first floor of the library this past fall will be revisiting the University to gain insight from students and staff on the new design for the library PERIOD

It has been twenty years since we opened doors with plans that came out of the nineties prior to so many changes in technology and education said Karen Schneider Dean of the Library PERIOD

The library was originally constructed during an era before wifi smartphones and the many other technological advances that are an inevitable part of students everyday lives PERIOD With the assistance of student and staff ideas Sonoma State will be able to design a space that is more efficient and suitable for students of this decade PERIOD

There are currently many concerns among students and university staff with the state of the schools library one of the most popular being its layout PERIOD

Our building has an interesting design that makes it hard to find what you are looking forwhether it be a book a room or another person said Schenider PERIOD

Schneider suggested installing a glass staircase which would stand close to the center of the library PERIOD

The staircase would work as a visual anchor for students to be instantly grounded so they know where they are at in the building said Schneider PERIOD

Schneider believes this will be beneficial for students because it will be an easier way for students to find what they are looking for throughout the building PERIOD A similar concern was mentioned by library employee and student Abigail Carr a first year student at Sonoma State who assists students at the Help Desks in the library PERIOD Carr agreed that the current design of the library makes it hard for students to find books and material they may be looking for PERIOD

Making a more convenient system to locate books should for sure be in the schools plan for the redesign said Carr PERIOD She is asked by dozens of students everyday on how to locate books they are looking for PERIOD

With the recent completion of construction on the first floor Schneider wants to incorporate the ideas that helped make the first floor a more reliable and convenient place for students to study PERIOD The new study cubicles currently only located on the first floor have become a popular attraction among hardworking students PERIOD These study cubicles create an effective and private learning environment where students are able to work independently without the distraction of having to sit with other students PERIOD This new addition to the library has been very popular PERIOD

The cubicles are a really fun new way to study in the library I wish they had them all over the campus said fourth year student Daniel James PERIOD

The most recent plans for the future library incorporate adding more effective places for students to study PERIOD This may include creating single and group designed study rooms PERIOD Schneider also mentioned Sonoma States plan to focus more on inclusion by building nongender restrooms and nursing rooms to support staff who have children PERIOD All these factors are aimed to make the library not only a better place to study but a safe and inclusive place for all of the students and staff PERIOD

The library belongs to the students which means it is your building and needs to be designed to fit the needs of you the student said Schneider PERIOD

These design sessions are geared towards encouraging the creative ideas of students and staff to help recreate an essential part of our campus PERIOD Students and staff can register for these design sessions on the Seawolf Living website and can attend an hour and a half session on Feb PERIOD  or  PERIOD By participating in the library redesign sessions students and staff will be making their dreams a reality while also benefiting the Sonoma State community for years to come PERIOD
