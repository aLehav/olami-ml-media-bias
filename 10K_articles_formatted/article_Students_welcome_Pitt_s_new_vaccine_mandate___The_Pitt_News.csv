Students pictured at a late January vaccination clinic hosted by Pitt and the Allegheny County Health Department PERIOD

By  Abby Cardilli Staff Writer December  

Pitts vaccination policy which requires that all students faculty and staff be vaccinated against COVID19 went into effect Monday PERIOD The stakes for unvaccinated students who dont get an exemption are high  disenrollment for the spring semester PERIOD

The interim policy which the University announced Nov PERIOD  mandates that students faculty and staff complete a series of COVID19 vaccine doses authorized or approved by the Food and Drug Administration or World Health Organization including those made by Moderna Johnson  Johnson and Pfizer PERIOD If a student fails to meet the deadline they will not be eligible to enroll or will be disenrolled from spring  classes PERIOD They also cant live in residence halls starting on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

For unvaccinated University faculty and staff the vaccine mandate policy said they are subject to disciplinary action. this can include loss of electronic resources as well as termination of employment PERIOD

While some students are on board with the mandate which followed in the footsteps of other colleges and universities across the country some like Clair Nincke wished it had been implemented before the fall semester began PERIOD

While I wish that a mandate could have been enacted for this semester I trusted that my fellow Pitt students would get vaccinated before campus Nincke a junior economics and psychology major said PERIOD I hoped that the policies implemented by Pitt towards nonvaccinated students faculty and staff would encourage them to get vaccinated. a University spokesperson said Pitt chose Dec PERIOD  as the implementation date for the vaccine mandate to allow enough time to prepare for the spring term and to work with students to complete the vaccination process PERIOD

Dec PERIOD  was chosen as the start of the vaccine mandate to allow time to make necessary changes to enrollment housing or employment statuses for the start of the new term the spokesperson said PERIOD We will also use this time to work with those individuals who have started the process to become compliant by Dec PERIOD  but need additional time to complete the process. faculty staff and students can request an exemption from the vaccine requirement based on medical religious or moral reasons PERIOD Medical exemptions require a doctors signature and religious or moral exemptions require a notarized attestation PERIOD Those seeking an exemption must submit forms to the Office of Equity Diversity and Inclusion for vetting PERIOD If approved these individuals will still be subjected to additional mitigation measures such as routine COVID19 testing PERIOD

According to a University spokesperson as of Nov PERIOD  OEDI received a total of  submissions with  of those requests accepted and four contacted for clarification or further information PERIOD The spokesperson said Pitt currently has no definitive expectation for the number of exemptions PERIOD

The University continues to strongly encourage all members of our community to be vaccinated and expects our overall vaccination rate to continue to increase the spokesperson said PERIOD

The spokesperson added that throughout December Pitt will continue to work with those who wish to come into compliance and final decisions regarding compliance to the vaccine mandate  including employee status and student disenrollment  will be made in early January PERIOD The University will report compliance numbers in early January PERIOD

Although there is an exemption option Nincke said she was not concerned about possible pushback from the vaccine mandate PERIOD

Knowing the general attitudes of the student body I knew that the mandate would be generally accepted and appreciated Nincke said PERIOD

The vaccine mandate policy said the most successful and sustainable way to keep the Pitt community safe is vaccination PERIOD More than  of the Pitt community including students faculty and staff are currently vaccinated PERIOD

Alyssa Stouch a junior neuroscience major said this high vaccination rate along with Pitts COVID19 mitigation guidelines made campus feel safer PERIOD While she supports the mandate she said she understands why Pitt initially made getting vaccinated optional PERIOD

As much as I wish everyone would get the vaccine I understand why people having the choice was the initial position Stouch said PERIOD I personally have felt safe being fully vaccinated and knowing masks are required in all University buildings. but with the Omicron variant spreading in the U.S PERIOD and rising COVID19 cases on campus she said the mandate is a good move to keep the Pitt community safe PERIOD

Now that cases have been going up I feel that a vaccine mandate is necessary for the health and wellbeing of Pitt students staff and faculty Stouch said PERIOD

With fall semester quickly coming to a close Nincke is also in favor of Pitts mandate in light of the changing conditions surrounding COVID19 PERIOD

A fully vaccinated student body makes me feel safe and hopeful for a return to normalcy Nincke said PERIOD Hopefully classes and student life will become less restrictive as a result of the mandate. join our newsletter
