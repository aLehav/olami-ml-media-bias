Walt Disney once said Laughter is timeless Imagination has no age and dreams are forever. but not everyone agrees with the creator of the Happiest Place on Earth PERIOD

Weve all heard twitter culture comment and produce endless memes on the lives of childless adults who attend Disney on the regular but a recent viral rant by a mother touched on her frustration with childless millennials who love to attend this nostalgic theme park PERIOD

In the viral Facebook post the mother of a cranky 3yearold explained that Childless Millennials should be banned from Disney World PERIOD In her explicit rant the mother detailed an instant in which she visited Disney World with her son who wanted a Mickeyshaped pretzel that he had seen a childless adult purchase but couldnt purchase because of the long lines which made him upset PERIOD In her post she claimed that Disney was a FAMILY amusement park and that people without CHILDREN need to be banned PERIOD

The mother wasnt the only one who had something to say about these Disneyloving adults PERIOD

A recent article from Nypost titled Sorry childless millennials going to Disney World is weird also agreed with the ranting mother PERIOD The article however took the stance that although Disney allows you to relive your childhood a trip to The Happiest Place on Earth can cost the same as a trip to Europe PERIOD

But what are Disneys thoughts on Childless Millennials

Parents of younger kids might have a problem but Disney has been taking advantage of the real money maker PERIOD

Despite the park being marketed as a socalled Family amusement park Disney has been chasing after Childless Millennials who are nostalgic for their childhood offering everything from adultsonly cruises cocktails in restaurants and nightclubs and lounges for years PERIOD

Walt Disney had the vision and intent of Disney World being a place for all people to enjoy themselves with entertainment in all forms to have people of all walks of life and ages have fun PERIOD Wonder imagination inspiration and happiness doesnt stop when you hit a certain age PERIOD It seems as though those people who believe in banning millennials have forgotten that said Sophomore Kathleen Mabunay who has been an annual pass holder for five years PERIOD

I think people should be allowed to enjoy whatever they want Ive been going to Disney since I was a baby and I dont think I should bar myself off from it now just because Im older PERIOD That doesnt make sense said Sophomore student Christian Durham PERIOD
