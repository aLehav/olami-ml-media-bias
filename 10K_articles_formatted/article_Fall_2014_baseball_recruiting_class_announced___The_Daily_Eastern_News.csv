Easterns baseball team announced its latest recruiting class with six players set to join the Panthers for the  season PERIOD The recruiting class will have three pitchers and three position players joining Easterns roster PERIOD



Alex Cain Oregon Ill. is a 6foot3inch righthanded pitcher that was an allconference first team selection as a junior at Oregon High School PERIOD Cain posted a  record with a . eRA and  strikeouts in  innings pitched PERIOD He also proved to be effective at the plate posting a . batting average with  RBI PERIOD

I think with Cain because he is so athletic and so talented I dont think it will be an issue playing him both ways Schmitz said PERIOD I think Cain is good enough to pitch and play the field without any issues. scmitz also said that Cains breaking ball along with a solid fastball could have him playing the role of closer for the Panthers when he joins the program PERIOD

Jake Haberer Highland Ill is a 6foot2inch righthanded pitcher that was also an allconference first team selection in his junior season at Highland High School PERIOD Haberer posted a  record with a . eRA and  strikeouts last season PERIOD

Chase Thurston Danville Ill. will round out the trio of pitchers that are set to join the Panthers for the  season PERIOD Thurston is a 5foot11inch righthanded pitcher that was an allconference first team selection playing at Danville High School PERIOD Thurston posted a  record to go along with a . eRA and  strikeouts in  appearances PERIOD

I think Haberer has a chance to be in the starting rotation and I think Cain can be a twoway threat and Thurston has one of the best out pitches I have seen in a long time Schmitz said PERIOD I think all three of them will have an impact. troy Vandenbroek Belvidere Ill. was an allconference first team selection playing for Belvidere High School PERIOD Vandenbroek recorded a . batting average with  RBI and  doubles last season PERIOD The Panthers are projecting Vandenbroek to be a middle of the lineup hitter PERIOD

When it comes to hitting Vanderbroek is one of the best pure power hitters Schmitz said PERIOD There are very few hitters that come in here knowing how to hit but Troy is the wowguy out of the class PERIOD He really knows how to hit and hit with pop and as a freshman that is pretty amazing. marshawn Taylor Chicago Ill. was an allcity selection in his sophomore and junior season playing the shortstop position for Simeon Career Academy PERIOD Taylor posted a . batting average to go with  RBI and  stolen bases last season PERIOD

Marshawn Taylor is one of the most polished guys we have ever brought in here Schmitz said PERIOD He is a plus runner and a good shortstop. drew Sterioti Naperville Ill. rounds out the recruiting class that will join Eastern for the  season PERIOD Sterioti played primarily at third base for Neuqua Valley High School posting a . batting average to go along with five RBI and a . onbase percentage PERIOD
