8799,2023-11-04,"im not an art major or minor PERIOD

Im not a good artist PERIOD

I dont have any expertise in art history or critique PERIOD

Thats what I like about art its easy and even encouraged me to have an opinion on it art is so subjective that anything goes PERIOD

I dont understand how people can take so long at art museums PERIOD I just look at an art piece for about  seconds and decide what my opinion is PERIOD

Like dislike makes me uncomfortable confusing hate awful modern art therefore dislike pretty boring ooooh cool weird. i can get through a museum in about ten minutes PERIOD

Thats why I like to spin through Doane Hall of Art every so often see what my fellow students are up to and judge them PERIOD

I also enjoy the chalk drawings on the side of Doane PERIOD Its a nice touch  sort of spontaneous and whimsical PERIOD

Speaking of whimsical I hear there is a stuffed penguin in Carnegie PERIOD Not that I would call taxidermy art so much as kind of creepy but penguins are charming enough to get away with the weird factor of taxidermy PERIOD

I havent been able to find it though despite my best efforts PERIOD

Also whats up with that sculpture on the bottom floor of the library Im sorry but it startles me every time I go down there PERIOD

Im just absently walking down the stairs only to be assaulted by some misshapen melting creature hugging and making out with itself PERIOD

I finally figured out that there is supposed to be a faceless girl that the boy in the sculpture is hugging but curiously enough that does not help PERIOD

I dont know why I have such a grudge against this sculpture except that it has always made me uncomfortable PERIOD

I love libraries PERIOD Libraries are supposed to be welcoming comforting beacons of knowledge PERIOD That statue is not helping PERIOD

On the other hand I am a huge fan of the new alligator sculpture outside the Campus  Center PERIOD That guy is beastly and ferocious PERIOD

Plus the landscaping was really well done so it looks like he is coming out of a swamp PERIOD

Its a classy statue wellmade but also totally fun PERIOD Nothing brings a smile to my face like our gator guy looking grumpy while covered in snow PERIOD

Can we please start decorating him I am honestly disappointed this has not already happened PERIOD

Where was his seasonal Santa hat

Now that the weathers turning nice it seems like a perfect time for a crown of flowers or a lei PERIOD

Dear People please help me out with this PERIOD I can only imagine how charmingly ferocious he would look all dressed up PERIOD

And what about the senior circle

I dont think I get it PERIOD

I like the echo spot PERIOD Thats cool but past that is questionable PERIOD

I heard  and this is absolute pure unfounded rumor  that it was supposed to be a gator but they cut out the fourth section because it would be too close to Montgomery Gym PERIOD

One how did the artist feel about us literally cutting the head off of their work

Two how did we not foresee this problem before we agreed to do it

Im pretty sure I would like it if it had a head PERIOD

Thats a fun cool concept and lighting it up does make it look gorgeous when it is snowing PERIOD

If anyone had asked me I would have preferred a couple people running into the head while recklessly coming out of Montgomery to spending money on an unfinished piece of artwork PERIOD

Lets be honest  people running into things is pretty hilarious anyway PERIOD

Finally did you guys know there is a gator statue in the middle of a field up by Robertson

It is the most random piece of artwork Ive come across PERIOD Its just straightup in the middle of a field PERIOD

Everyone should go look for it

You can enjoy our beautiful forests and the great weather while youre up there PERIOD

After all it sure is beautiful outside nowadays PERIOD
