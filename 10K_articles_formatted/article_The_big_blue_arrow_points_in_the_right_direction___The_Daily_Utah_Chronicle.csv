417,2023-10-23,"theres an old adage amongst physicians that goes Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley in the morning will cure whatever ails you. as far as The Blue Plate Diner is concerned truer words were never spoken PERIOD 
Just grab some dark sunglasses and slip into your flipflops PERIOD No need to be formal here PERIOD Look for the enormous blue arrow in the sky near the corner of  East and  South PERIOD This arrow will conveniently direct you to the front door of the Blue Plate Diner PERIOD Kind humans will seat you at your choice of bar table or booth and you will be immediately dosed with comforting black coffee PERIOD 
No your tender brain is not deceiving you those Elvis paintings on the wall do look like they are melting and yes almost all of the interior dcor is Elvis related PERIOD Elvis soothing velvety voice caresses your ears from the speakers above and you begin to feel a little better PERIOD When The King isnt crooning you can expect The Man in Black to tell you some tall tales PERIOD
As far as the menu goes the Huevos Rancheros are a delicious albeit strange breakfasttwo fried eggs sit on top of two huge black bean pancakes blanketed by bell peppers onions and melted cheese PERIOD 
For you hangover victims any one of Blue Plates hearty omelets with homefries will soak up the remainder of the toxins still left in your stomach as will the fruitcovered waffles and pancakes PERIOD Your coffee will seem bottomless as your server tops it off before you get to that last questionable sip PERIOD
Still the most wellknown for good reason dish at The Plate is the house specialty Blue Benedicta sizeable double helping of poached eggs sitting atop a quarterinch thick slice of Canadian bacon drizzled with delectable hollandaise sauce and served with a helping of home fries PERIOD Even if youre not a traditional benedict fan The Blue Plates special will do much to sway your leanings PERIOD
Excellent service is no big deal at Blue Plate its just the norm PERIOD You will not have much luck getting a job as a server though since the original staff which was hired on at Blue Plates opening in  has stayed ever sincesays something about the atmosphere no 
However the nostalgia does not end with Elvis and the veteran staff PERIOD 
The booths patrons sit in came from the Olympic Club in Fillmore and the soda fountain and bar were acquired from Salina Drug PERIOD How ironic to be nursing a hangover over a bar imported from Utahs only legally dry town PERIOD
Not only good for the morning pickmeup Blue Plate also has great lunch and dinner PERIOD From homestyle favorites like chicken fried steak and liver and onions to huge burgers like the blue cheese bacon burger served with classic or my recommendation Cajun wedge fries PERIOD 
In addition to great food Blue Plate has amicable employees and a wellknown presence in the Salt Lake diner circuit PERIOD So whether you are smiling like Elvis because you sustained a blow to the left side of your face last night or just because Blue Plates ambiance wore off on you during your meal one thing is for sure Leave Blue Plate Diner and youll be leaving happy PERIOD
