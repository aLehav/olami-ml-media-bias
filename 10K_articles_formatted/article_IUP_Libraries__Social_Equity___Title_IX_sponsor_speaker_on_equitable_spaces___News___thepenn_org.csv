The event which was cosponsored by IUP Libraries and the Social Equity  Title IX Office is part of a Speaker Series that will be taking place throughout the remainder of the semester PERIOD

An activist spoke on the importance of changing the systems that leave Black students disadvantaged in terms of education PERIOD

On Feb PERIOD  IUP Libraries and the Social Equity  Title IX Office hosted a presentation on creating a more equitable education space in higher education for Black and Brown students in Pennsylvania PERIOD This presentation is part of the IUP Libraries  speaker series PERIOD

The speaker in this zoom presentation was Dr PERIOD Jessica Spradley the Vice President of Research and Assessment at the Care Based Leadership Collaborative and activist for Black excellence PERIOD Her and her husbands organization Care Based Leadership LLC focuses on providing inclusion and diversity training and cultural analysis to educational organizations as well as others PERIOD

The presentation started off with a small activity to break the ice PERIOD She asked the people who were present for the event to think of things in their life that happened recently made them happy or upset them PERIOD

Spradley then took some time to talk about herself her work her activism and what lead to her where she is right now PERIOD

She discussed how she once worked on fixing the systems that disadvantaged Black and Brown student PERIOD This act left her burned out PERIOD

We cannot be on activism all the time or it will burn us out. eventually Spradley came to a conclusion that changed her life PERIOD She decided that she would no longer try and fix a broken system instead she would try and take a different approach to fixing the problem at hand PERIOD

I was no longer trying to fix old and broken systems that hurt me and other people like me instead I was now trying to create new systems to help black and brown people in high education. the next topic that she discussed in her presentation was the subject of bias PERIOD The comment that she brought up was whether or not a bias could be something positive or negative PERIOD She made the point that this can be difficult to determine based on what type of bias could be presented like a bias toward what kind of apple that one would prefer PERIOD

She also talked about seed people a concept that she believes is very important PERIOD

The concept of a seed person is essentially that of a teacher or mentor PERIOD They plant the seeds of the next generation training and teaching them to become the person that they should be to better society PERIOD

The final part of her presentation was significant PERIOD She presented the line liberation without assimilation is the goal. the organizer of the event Carol A PERIOD Asamoah commented on her work and the presentation PERIOD

I have done this same type of work up at Punxsutawney for  years PERIOD The Black students there came from Philadelphia Pittsburgh and other Black majority areas of Pennsylvania they were here due to some low test scores PERIOD I helped them in programming and similar field to become better in this sort of field PERIOD Eventually I was called up here to continue my work. for those interested in learning more about Dr PERIOD Jessica Spradley she can be found on LinkedIn at httpswww.linkedin.cominjessicaspradley PERIOD
