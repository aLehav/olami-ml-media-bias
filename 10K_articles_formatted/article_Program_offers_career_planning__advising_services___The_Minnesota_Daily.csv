A lot can be said in a name PERIOD
For example the Office for Special Learning Opportunities which was recently remodeled changed its name to the Career and Community Learning Center naming itself for what students can find there PERIOD
The center offers University students both fundamental and practical lessons whether on or off campus for their career planning and life experience PERIOD
One part of the center located in  Johnston Hall manages the Career and Internship Services at its  Fraser Hall location the center offers the Community Involvement Programs and the National Student Exchange PERIOD
With the career service students might explore their possibilities and prepare for a career more easily and efficiently PERIOD It offers advising services and elective courses to seek suitable majors or jobs PERIOD
Through the Web site and office materials students can access more than  internship opportunities PERIOD The College of Liberal Arts Alumni Mentor program is an example of services offered in which students can learn more about particular jobs through yearlong oneonone meetings with professionals PERIOD
We are proud of the offers said Paul Timmins lead career services coordinator PERIOD
Through the community program students join nonprofit or government organizations in the Twin Cities working with social problems such as those in public health education and the environment PERIOD There is an option to participate in this program as a part of academic courses for various departments PERIOD
Students who participate in this program are expected to have a good understanding of and commitment to civic life PERIOD Laurel Hirt the coordinator of the community program said it is a winwin program because it is not only a great learning opportunity but also a benefit for society PERIOD In the last semester about  students participated through  organizations PERIOD
The student exchange is a national program in which students can attend one of the  other public universities and colleges PERIOD According to the centers brochures  states have at least one member university PERIOD
The main advantage of this program is the access to academic and social experiences students can have through the exchange PERIOD In addition the office has a program called Higher Education Consortium for Urban Affairs in which students learn urban studies and city arts with students from  other universities in the upper Midwest PERIOD
Though the center provides many options its usefulness basically depends on students PERIOD
Its so important  to think about career questions early on said Timmins PERIOD
We have a lot of offers PERIOD All they have to do is to come in find out more Hirt said PERIOD
