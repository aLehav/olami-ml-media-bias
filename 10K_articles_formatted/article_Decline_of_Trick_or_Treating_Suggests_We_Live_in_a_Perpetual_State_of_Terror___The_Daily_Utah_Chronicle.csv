409,2015-11-10,"seven trickortreaters this year PERIOD Only seven trickortreaters spent their Halloween walking the dangerous streets of my predominantly white Mormon neighborhood in Layton PERIOD Ive noticed a gradual decrease in trickortreaters since  PERIOD Whats so peculiar about Halloween now compared to five years ago Maybe trunkortreating has just dominated the scene for these parents or perhaps theres just not a lot of kids this year PERIOD However considering the local elementary school isnt closing its doors Id say thats not the problem PERIOD Its not just my neighborhood either  I looked on Facebook to find other people experiencing the same thing PERIOD Then I saw it  the reason plain as day in a reply to these kinds of posts I just cant trust my neighbors anymore. the decrease in trickortreaters is not the result of some kind of increase in psychopaths poisoning candy PERIOD Yet the common belief is that its safer not to go trickortreating as if the people in the neighborhood have suddenly been replaced with lunatics PERIOD The majority of the people in this neighborhood consist of the same people from five years ago PERIOD Quite a few of them were real Halloween enthusiasts  some transformed their entire garages into mini haunted houses PERIOD This difference is not the result of greater danger for children its merely the result of the perception of such danger propagated by the news media PERIOD

Have the hypedup warnings about the prevalence of razor blades in Twix bars that consistently show up every Halloween suddenly driven home the hysterical message Considering that there were six reported cases of tampered candy last year in the entire nation you could hardly call this a serious problem PERIOD Supposedly there have only been a total of  incidents of sharp objects placed in Halloween candy since  PERIOD

Though tamperedwith Halloween candy is and certainly has been a fear it was calmed by parents telling their kids not to eat candy that had already been opened PERIOD Simple enough PERIOD If you were extra careful you didnt eat easily rewrappable candy like Tootsie rolls PERIOD Razor blades werent enough to prevent the parents of my generation from letting us celebrate Halloween PERIOD This whole dont trust your neighbor mentality has developed separately from Halloween and the lack of trickortreaters is the result PERIOD

The propagation of danger on daytime television has become so constant that weve become convinced that the outside world is a dangerous place PERIOD You could say parents have become extremely gullible PERIOD The constant fearmongering on the news has a much greater sense of reality than it did even just a few years ago PERIOD Weve become aware that school shootings police brutality and all kinds of incidents that we used to think were just isolated issues are appearing with greater frequency PERIOD Our old idea was that what happened on screen doesnt really happen to us PERIOD Now it feels like thats no longer the case PERIOD

This inability to trust even your neighbors is fairly similar to the publics feelings during the cold war PERIOD Its a sign that we do live in a perpetual state of terror just as our nation did back then PERIOD How can we dare trust people we dont really know when were always looking at images of terror outside How silly is it that our greatest fear on Halloween is the celebration of the holiday itself
