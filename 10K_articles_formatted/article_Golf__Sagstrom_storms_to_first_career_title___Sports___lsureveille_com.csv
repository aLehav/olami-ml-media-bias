The final day of the Schooner Classic in Norman Okla PERIOD began with an LSU golfer in the lead and ended the same way PERIOD

The names just swapped PERIOD

Junior Madelene Sagstrom fired a  in the final round to take home her first individual title while freshman Caroline Nistrups 2overpar  dropped her from first to fourth as the Lady Tigers fell from the team lead into a tie for third PERIOD

LSU finished eight strokes behind Oklahoma State which used a 1under par final round to run away with the team crown PERIOD Oklahoma beat the Lady Tigers by nine strokes in the third round to claim second PERIOD

But the individual champion honors belonged to Sagstrom who had never won a college tournament despite an AllSoutheastern Conference campaign as a sophomore PERIOD

She bided her time at Belmar Golf Club sticking around with consecutive evenpar  rounds to open the event PERIOD

Sagstrom nearly pulled away from the field opening the round with three birdies in four holes before two bogies threatened to stunt her round PERIOD But four birdies in the next seven holes made a late bogey irrelevant as Sagstrom held off Kentuckys Liz Breed by two shots PERIOD

Madelenes had several secondplace finishes and close calls said LSU coach Karen Bahnsen PERIOD We agreed no one was going to look at the scores and just stay in the moment  she calls it her bubble PERIOD She stayed in the moment today and got over the hump. breed posted a tournamentbest  on Monday to push Sagstrom down the stretch PERIOD

Sagstroms performance was a noticeably better effort than her junior debut when she finished 4over par and tied for thirtieth last month at the Cougar Classic in South Carolina PERIOD

Meanwhile Nistrup posted another top15 effort to begin her collegiate career building off a 13thplace finish at the Cougar Classic PERIOD

She entered Mondays round with the lead after an impeccable 5underpar  during Sundays blustery weather to offset a firstround  PERIOD

An LSU duel for first appeared imminent with Sagstrom and Nistrup occupying the top spots on the leaderboard through two rounds PERIOD Instead a triple bogey  on the fifth hole and three bogeys in the last  holes derailed Nistrups title hopes PERIOD

Its a weird little par  straight up the hill Bahnsen said of Nistrups fifth hole PERIOD If you hit it over the green a little bit you go out of bounds and she just missed by one club long or shed be right there for the win PERIOD She did balance the bogeys with some birdies late and really fought to keep us in it. senior Ali Lucas bounced back from a tough Sunday with a sevenshot improvement for an evenpar  on Monday PERIOD She finished tied for twenty-second PERIOD

The par4s hindered LSU all week as the Lady Tigers posted a . stroke average on those holes tied for eighth out of  teams PERIOD Oklahoma State finished  strokes better on such holes PERIOD

Sagstrom however didnt struggle with them PERIOD She averaged . strokes on par4s tied for the best in the field PERIOD

Still the tournament was a comeback of sorts after an 11thplace finish at the Cougar Classic disappointed Bahnsen PERIOD

We didnt put too much stock into that first one Bahnsen said PERIOD Im really proud of the team  even though we didnt finish off the win  that we fought some wind and tough conditions during this tournament and were in contention PERIOD Two of our girls struggled Monday PERIOD If we had gotten that fourth score we could have won it. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
