The other day I heard about a freshman who did not think she belonged at Biola PERIOD During the story she said The people here are just so good and admitted that she felt intimidated by their goodness PERIOD Implicitly I heard her say that she was not good enough to be here PERIOD In a strange sort of way my heart dropped as I listened PERIOD I do not think I am good enough to be at Biola either PERIOD

I had not really thought about it before but suddenly began to see a difference between some of the Biola students I know and myself PERIOD They all seem shiny PERIOD Everything about them strikes me as righteous PERIOD They are the types who go on mission trips who love going to all three church services on Sunday who hold doors open for people and pray for me PERIOD Part of me wishes they faked their holiness PERIOD But I can actually see the Holy Spirit transforming them into the image of God and can see the fruits of this process in their Christlike action PERIOD

I think the Holy Spirit is working inside me as well but it looks different PERIOD I do not want to go on a mission PERIOD I am not even sure where I stand on the whole missions thing PERIOD I dread going to church every week and have to force myself not to fake sick PERIOD I love to gossip and constantly compare myself to other people PERIOD I suspect my inner dialogue would make most people cringe PERIOD

The loudest Holy Spirit interventions in my life are usually retroactive PERIOD It sometimes takes me a week to realize I have been obsessing over that thing someone said to me and have begun to imagine ways to hurt them before God finally yells Forgive them already Crap PERIOD So over the course of a couple days I work myself into a place of forgiveness kind of PERIOD God carries me most of the way PERIOD And a good chunk of the time I let go of whatever the thing was or go and apologize to the person I hurt PERIOD

If being a good Christian means being perfect or even particularly good I do not meet the criteria PERIOD If Biola is a collection of good folk I snuck in somehow PERIOD Being human is really difficult and I have not gotten the hang of it PERIOD But I think being a Christian should make being a human easier not harder PERIOD Jesus spent a good deal of his time at the loser table PERIOD He came to take the gossipy cynics like me and adopt them PERIOD I the churchhater receive full childofGod privileges PERIOD Partly this means I belong in his Church even before I know what he expects of me PERIOD It also means that God commits to making me shiny like him PERIOD

If I am not careful I still fixate on the scars of my sin PERIOD I think they make me stand out especially around good Christian folk PERIOD But Jesus has scars too PERIOD I belong at Biola because I belong to Christ and to his Church PERIOD Together we are a bunch of recovering scarred sinners that God made and continues to make into his children PERIOD
