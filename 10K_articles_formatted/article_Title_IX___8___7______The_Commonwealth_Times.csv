This past week marked the thirtieth anniversary of the historic Roe v PERIOD Wade ruling by the U.S PERIOD Supreme Court a ruling that the former President George Bush wanted overturned during his time in office PERIOD It should come as no surprise then to find out that the current Bush administration is equally antiwomens rights PERIOD Im not referring to the antiabortion agenda that our compassionate conservative president supports but rather the proposed changes to Title IX that are being considered during his administration PERIOD

For those who may not know what Title IX is it was a law passed in  that prohibits schools receiving federal funding from discriminating in all educational programs including athletics on basis of gender www.Washingtonpost.com Friday Jan. p PERIOD A01 PERIOD According to an article by Washington Post staff writer Michael Fletcher however the proposed change to Title IX amongst two dozen such proposals being studied by a national commission studying reform of Title IX would allow schools to devote as little as  percent of their athletic scholarships to women and still comply with the law  even though women comprise  percent of the enrollment in the nations fouryear colleges. even if one were to ignore the studies that show participation in athletics helps womens selfesteem and health or the fact that the number of women enrolling in colleges is on the rise as the Bush administration is apparently doing altering Title IX would still be a bad idea PERIOD

While there are probably some female athletes whose first focus is athletics just as there are male athletes who focus on it just as heavily if not more so athletic scholarships are sometimes the only way to get money for college PERIOD Saying that schools can unequally distribute this money solely on the basis of gender and still work within the law is a violation of the law in and of itself PERIOD

Some would argue that because of the enforcement of Title IX some positions on teams or mens sports in general have suffered in order to guarantee equal access and opportunities for womens sports PERIOD I however would like to suggest an alternate possible reason for lagging interest in mens sports PERIOD The world is changing as we move into the information age and beyond more emphasis is being placed on academics and our ability to understand more complex technology PERIOD As a result schools have to spend more money on technology so well be prepared for the real world after graduation PERIOD As a result of this theres less money in general for expenditures for both men and womens athletics programs PERIOD Added to the fact the economy is doing poorly across the nation and we can see how that further affects what a school can and cannot spend on sports PERIOD

Equality is not the cause of budget issues so much as a lack of interest in certain sports may be the reason for their elimination PERIOD And personally though I do understand that there are unequal fan bases I feel that both mens and womens sports are both important PERIOD I know there are some guys out there who may disagree with me who may in fact think womens sports dont deserve as much money as mens sports do and they are entitled to that opinion PERIOD However to those who feel that way remember most of the nations poor are women with dependent children for every dollar a man makes a woman makes roughly  cents for the same work PERIOD I could go on and on but the fact remains that this is still very much a maledominated society PERIOD Therefore there is no need to feel threatened by womens sportsthe ball has been in our court throughout history but now its time to pass it to someone else instead of playing keepaway PERIOD
