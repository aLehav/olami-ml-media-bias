Most people want to end hunger and the work of one Virginia Tech student is making that a reality for hundreds of college students PERIOD

Kelly Berry a junior agriculture and life sciences major was first inspired to provide for hungry students by volunteering at food pantries while she was on mission trips PERIOD After hearing about a particular homeless individual she decided to act on her desire to feed those in need PERIOD

I heard a story from a friend about one gentleman who was living out of the gym had a locker at the gym and whod take his showers there said Berry PERIOD Then in the evenings hed go and study in the library and hed stay there all night.. PERIOD he put himself through school that way. berrys solution was to begin the  Manna Ministry  located at the Wesley Foundation building on West Roanoke Street  the food pantry will provide resources for any student who needs them PERIOD

The first opening of the food pantry will be Thursday from  to  p.m. with operations continuing weekly around the same time PERIOD Students who come will receive points with which they can purchase the needed food rather than handing each person a prepacked bag PERIOD A large variety of food is available in order to give the students the food they like and to avoid allergy conflicts PERIOD

According to Wesley Foundation Campus Minister Bret Gresham the university has readily supported efforts to establish the food pantry PERIOD

When Kelly shared her dream with the entire Division of Student Affairs they had one question about it.. PERIOD When is it going to open Gresham said PERIOD

Both Gresham and Berry were adamant that the goal of this food pantry is not to advertise the Wesley Foundation ministry but to work with the Tech community as a whole to provide a good service PERIOD

Berry is pleased with the response of the community thus far PERIOD Multiple food drives have provided the majority of the stock and volunteers have stepped up to help with work in the building PERIOD

At the food drive in Kroger we would ask customers while they were shopping just to get an extra item on their list said Berry PERIOD They would sometimes get more than one item. one of the biggest concerns in the food pantrys imminent opening is whether they can maintain an adequate supply of food PERIOD According to Gresham other campuses around the nation like Oregon State and Arkansas have similar food pantries PERIOD Student enrollments at both schools equal approximately  students and their ministries serve about  students each week PERIOD

Our fear is with a student population of around  are we going to be able to handle  students coming through the door Gresham said PERIOD

However the positive response from the community along with their beliefs and faith have neutralized their doubts PERIOD

Nevertheless volunteers are needed at food drives and in the Wesley Foundation itself while others are needed to donate food and other materials to the cause PERIOD

Were going to start a drop box in the front lobby area where people can come and just drop cans that they have if were not here during the day Berry said PERIOD

Another goal of this project is to increase awareness that food insecurity is actually an issue for college students PERIOD

Its hard to say that there is a need because it is so unrecognizable but there definitely is based on the research weve done said Berry PERIOD I think its awesome that this is actually a possibility and that it has become a reality. log In
