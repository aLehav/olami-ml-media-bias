7761,2023-11-05,"g.K PERIOD Chesterton a notable convert to Catholicism from the twentieth century once rightly pointed out Merely having an open mind is nothing PERIOD The object of opening the mind as of opening the mouth is to shut it again on something solid. so are atheists openminded If not is their mind shut on something solid

In some of my experiences if asked whether atheists are openminded they will state that they are PERIOD They say that if you show them the evidence that God exists they will believe PERIOD However if presented with evidence for the existence of God theyll often reject it thinking you are putting forth a flawed God of the gaps argument PERIOD They dont want to rush to put God as the explanation when we can just wait for science to explain things PERIOD

At first this seems rational PERIOD Science has a great track record of explanatory power PERIOD For example it can help us explain the evolution of life show that the universe began to exist . billion years ago and help us to cure complex diseases PERIOD However the nature of evidence for God takes on a philosophical form rather than scientific PERIOD If one says any possible evidence for God isnt good enough because there must be an undiscovered scientific explanation then thats not really openminded PERIOD Thats just assuming no evidence is good enough unless its scientific evidence PERIOD Its making up your mind before youve given God a chance PERIOD

If you are an atheist reading this answer the following question What specific evidence would make you believe in God Im not wondering what type of evidence but come up with a specific example of something that would change your mind PERIOD One reasonable answer to this I have heard is to request a miracle PERIOD For example one might pray and then have an amputated limb spontaneously regenerated PERIOD However this doesnt exactly solve the problem if we are to avoid an argument from ignorance PERIOD Calling a spontaneously regenerated limb after prayer evidence for God is just saying I dont know what caused it therefore God. its a God of the gaps PERIOD

No serious defender of the existence of God would put forth an argument in the form of I dont know therefore God. instead he or she would simply point out the fact that there are good reasons to believe certain things will never be explained naturally so they must be explained supernaturally PERIOD In particular we have reason to believe the origin of the universe will never be explained naturally PERIOD Because the beginning of the universe was the beginning of all space time and matter its cause must transcend these PERIOD And because space matter and time are the mediums through which we do science the original cause of the universe cannot be explained scientifically PERIOD

If you believe that amputated limbs wont grow back from nothing without a divine cause then why is the universe different If you are truly openminded then go look at reasons that God exists from the best philosophers past and present Edward Feser St PERIOD Thomas Aquinas Aristotle etc PERIOD  If you find them unconvincing at least after you have examined the reasons critically you can say what is wanting about the arguments PERIOD Thats a lot better than just assuming they dont succeed and not bothering to do some critical thinking on one of the most important issues there is PERIOD

To answer your question of what evidence would convince me of a God PERIOD My answer is I dont know have any idea but if there was a God it should know what would convince me PERIOD

Its easy to prove that God exists PERIOD Does prayer work Surely if it works there is some objective experiment we could do to prove it PERIOD Lets pray for a crystal clear sign from god PERIOD Hes omnipotent right Lets pray for a unicorn to appear somewhere PERIOD Or a purple tornado to show up on the national mall PERIOD Have him place a 100ft cross in the middle of Times Square PERIOD Does God not work that way

Lets have a more scientific example PERIOD  cancer patients PERIOD Well have everyone pray for one group and not pray for the other neither group knowing if theyre being prayed for PERIOD Surely well see a demonstrable increase in the survival rate of those being prayed for PERIOD

Already been tried PERIOD The result Not only did prayer not help the patients those that were told they were being prayed for experienced more complications. httpfreethoughtpedia.comwikiHarvardprayerexperiment

I hope I would be compelled by evidence that would convince the majority of people of all faiths to convert based on that evidence PERIOD  That is say Christianity is true PERIOD  Jesus the savior the whole bit PERIOD  Whatever would convince all the Jews Muslims and Hindus to all convert to Christianity would be strong evidence IMO PERIOD

For those still prepared to search out an answer to the God question theres a new place to explore PERIOD The first wholly new interpretation for two thousand years of the moral teachings of Christ has been published PERIOD Radically different from anything else we know of from theology or history this new teaching is predicated upon the promise of a precise predefined predictable and repeatable  experience of transcendent omnipotence and called the first Resurrection in the sense that the Resurrection of Jesus was intended to demonstrate Gods willingness to reveal Himself and intervene directly into the natural world for those obedient to His Command paving the way for access by faith to the power of divine Will  and ultimate proof

Thus faith becomes an act of trust in action the search along a defined path of strict self discipline a test of the human heart to discover His  Word of a direct individual intervention into the natural world by omnipotent power that confirms divine will law command and covenant which at the same time realigns our mortal moral compass with the Divine correcting human nature by a change in natural law altering biology consciousness and human ethical perception beyond all natural evolutionary boundaries. thus is a man created in the image and likeness of his Creator PERIOD

So like it or no a new religious teaching testable by faith meeting all Enlightenment criteria of evidence based causation and definitive proof now exists and carries all the implications that suggests PERIOD Nothing short of an intellectual moral and religious revolution is getting under way PERIOD To test or not to test that is the question Im testing this now for myself PERIOD More info at httpwww.energon.org.uk

The naive irony in this article shows some of the fundamental flaws in assuming that some things require a divine explanation when the best answer is we dont know. the author makes a tremendous and flawed leap of logic PERIOD  Claiming that the beginning of the universe must transcend our knowledge of space and time does not mean that the mechanism must be supernatural PERIOD  The only coherent and supportable answer is we dont know. the author has used the all too human discomfort with not knowing to support the same god of the gaps argument he claims is an unfair characterization of religious belief PERIOD

There are some questions that may never be answered by anyone living nor any of our descendants PERIOD Aquinas in Summa Theologica put forth a reformulated version of the classic Greek arguments for the existence of god as well as several argument for natural law. all of these arguments make fundamental assumptions about the nature of the universe and causality which cannot be assumed to be true PERIOD  If we have learned anything from Quantum mechanics and relativity it is that our basic human perceptions in no way explain the nature of things PERIOD  Using arguments like the uncaused cause the prime mover etc. are based in logical fallacies PERIOD  For believers it confirms their understanding of god for the open minded seeker he or she will be left scratching their heads PERIOD  Consequently I find it truly ironic that the author claims that open minded leaves room for god when true skepticism and a curious mind should lead at best to agnosticism PERIOD

Hey Chris I appreciate the feedback PERIOD I must point out the fact that many people are not left scratching their heads when faced with the actual arguments for the existence of God not caricatures of them PERIOD In fact Edward Feser whom I mentioned in the article is one of many people who were over time convinced of Gods existence PERIOD Hope you can take a good look at his recent book httpswww.amazon.comFiveProofsExistenceEdwardFeserdp1621641333

The book has good reviews even from people who disagree with him PERIOD

Aquinas in Summa Theologica put forth a reformulated version of the classic Greek arguments for the existence of god as well as several argument for natural law. all of these arguments make fundamental assumptions about the nature of the universe and causality which cannot be assumed to be true PERIOD

What assumptions did they make and with what good reason have we to doubt them

If we have learned anything from Quantum mechanics and relativity it is that our basic human perceptions in no way explain the nature of things PERIOD

I havent learnt that PERIOD  All of science including QM and relativity merely describe reality it does not tell us what reality is PERIOD",On atheism and open-mindedness – Trinitonian,Trinity University
