e your age taking trips to Dubai riding jet skis in Cabo starting careers at their dream job getting engaged to their soulmate and graduating with honors in four years PERIOD Stress and anxiety tighten your chest as you sit on your musty futon thinking about the months worth of laundry piled up in the corner your love life in shambles bills due an uncertain graduation date and an unclear direction of your career path PERIOD

But social media is a trap PERIOD Its a place where people post their highest highs where we present our best selves at our most attractive intelligent and interesting PERIOD This perfect persona weve grown accustomed to consuming plus the speed at which we live our lives and the need for instant gratification has rewired our brains PERIOD

Weve adopted a mindset of comparison  tallying the things we dont have against the things others do PERIOD

For a while I framed my life in shoulds. i should have graduated by now I should have gotten an internship in D.C I should be traveling the world PERIOD I should have found a job by now PERIOD It took me a while to see that measuring my life in this way was stalling me leaving me perpetually discouraged and unmotivated PERIOD

A  Huffington Post article lists the ages at which successful people have failed PERIOD At  Oprah was fired from her first job as a television reporter PERIOD A 24yearold Stephen King lived out of a trailer and worked as a janitor PERIOD At  J.K PERIOD Rowling was suicidal a single parent and on welfare PERIOD But they knew their lives meant more than what they were going through PERIOD They remained steadfast because they were aware of their higher purpose PERIOD

If you feel like time is running out know that there is no timer PERIOD If you think youre running a losing race there is no track PERIOD If you feel stuck its only because you know your passions are greater than your reality PERIOD

There is no formula for the life you want and comparing yourself to your peers wont get you there PERIOD What will is your work ethic tenacity and confidence in your stride PERIOD

It is okay to go at your own pace PERIOD Good luck on your journey PERIOD
