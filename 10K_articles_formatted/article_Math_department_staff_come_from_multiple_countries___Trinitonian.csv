7759,2023-11-05,"trinitys math department prides themselves on being one of the most diverse departments at the university PERIOD The department have named themselves as The  because their department is made up of nine faculty members from eight different nations spanning five continents PERIOD

Peter Olofsson the chair of the department arrived at Trinity with an already established diversity presence as the Swedish member from a team of Vietnamese Swedish Palestinian Cameroonian Croatian Brazilian Mexican and American faculty PERIOD

After I was hired we have hired two new faculty one from Cameroon in Africa and one from Vietnam in East Asia Olofsson said PERIOD

This newly enriched department serves as a stark change from the math department of several decades ago in which everyone was not only American but also Texan PERIOD

Its not a deliberate effort to get this global diversity its just something that has happened when we try to employ the best people for the job Olofsson said PERIOD

Hoa Nguyen a professor from Vietnam one of the most recent hires anticipated the diversity of Trinity when she initially applied PERIOD

Nguyen found maths universality to be one of the uniting factors of these varying cultures PERIOD

Math faculty can easily look over each others background native language or skin color to focus on what we think are important in math education and in our own research fields Nguyen said PERIOD Some students find it comforting to relate to an instructors origin PERIOD Other students enjoy learning new ways to think or see math concepts from different perspectives. a heightened diversity helps bring awareness for the cultural differences on staff PERIOD

It helps to keep in mind that we should all act professionally to create a positive environment in the department and for our students Nguyen said PERIOD

Senior math major Ellen Liaw garnered a unique perspective on the diversity within the math department PERIOD For example Liaw recounted a story from her personal educational experience that highlighted the positive impact the diversity of the department had on her education PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Macura was telling us in our Modern Algebra class about how in Croatia she had to learn real analysis her first year of college PERIOD Its not always how its exactly put into their teaching method but how they inspire and support us to move forward using their culture. liaw said PERIOD

For Liaw the math department is like a family and she looks at the future of a campus which shares in this tightknit diversity with cautious optimism PERIOD

It is possible to expand diversity to the entire school but its going to take a lot longer to do that because were fortunate to have so many faculty from all over the world PERIOD Its impossible for Trinity to look for specific races and countries when filling jobs Liaw said PERIOD

Those looking to get more involved with diversity on campus are encouraged to contact Dr PERIOD Olofsson or another member of The  PERIOD
