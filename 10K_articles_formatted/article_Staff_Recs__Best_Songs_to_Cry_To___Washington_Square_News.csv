For some next Wednesday will be just another hump day in our trivial existence but for those who buy into the Hallmark industrial complex Feb PERIOD  will be celebrated as Valentines Day PERIOD For those who dont have a date or are just plain cynical you are in luck PERIOD The WSN Staff compiled a playlist of the best songs to cry to as you fight against the mononormative patriarchal holiday PERIOD Sit back relax and feel all the feels PERIOD

Africa by Toto

Tom Miritello Audio Engineer

While audio engineering seems like an emotionless task I cry more often than anyone I know PERIOD And when I cry I make sure to listen to the song Africa by Toto PERIOD Despite the songs lyrics being a very strangely worded depiction of David Paichs love of Africa I cant help but think of it when I begin to shed a tear about any of the several issues that are plaguing my life PERIOD The lush vocal harmonies the virtuosoesque keyboard solo the ornate extended outro  theyre always there for me when Im reminded of how poorly my life is going PERIOD

Baby Blue by King Krule

Alejandro Villa Vsquez Deputy Copy Chief

Archy Marshall better known by his angsty stage name King Krule proves his prowess for gloom and doom time and time again  basically everything you want out of Valentines Day PERIOD This popular song especially loved by hipsters and trash art students alike Baby Blue opens with delicate guitar chords that drip like tears out of the speakers PERIOD It is a frigid ballad between Marshall and his guitar PERIOD He sings about painting skies and shadows crossing paths and as the song comes to solemn close with rocky interferences and Marshalls trademark moans you are left with nothing but some ghastly notes and a feeling of deprivation PERIOD Perfect for snuggling with yourself PERIOD

Call Me By Your Name Original Motion Picture Soundtrack by Various Artists

Ryan Mikel Arts Editor

The Call Me By Your Name soundtrack is  minutes of reckless emotional turbulence that evokes a poignant nostalgia of your first love  or for some a lack thereof PERIOD The soundtrack is a mixed bag of classics John Adams Johann Bach and Maurice Ravel that make you long for a romancefilled summer in Northern Italy with Timothe Chalamet PERIOD Then there are the Sufjan Stevenss compositions Mystery of Love and Visions of Gideon that remind you every good thing must come to an end PERIOD Sufjan why do you hurt me so much with your tiny voice

Chelsea Hotel  by Leonard Cohen

Jemima McEvoy EditorinChief

Leonard Cohen is not a good singer but that doesnt stop me from listening to his music and more specifically sobbing over one of his greatest songwriting feats Chelsea Hotel . the song captures a moment of pure intimacy where nothing in the outside world matters  everything is momentarily still in the cityscape of New York PERIOD There are no expectations beyond the moments described in his lyrics and with an aching intensity of ambiguous emotional intent Cohen proclaims in the chorus I never once heard you say I need you PERIOD I dont need you. it strips love down to its bones and leaves my brain swirling about what it really means to connect with another person PERIOD

Closure by Hope Waidley

Tyler Crews Opinion Editor

Closure by Hope Waidley is the perfect song for when youre in the mood to wallow PERIOD It is best listened to when already sad however it can effectively bring down your good mood if thats your thing PERIOD Waidley has yet to garner much attention but her raw vocals and vulnerable lyrics set the scene for the perfect breakup song PERIOD With lyrics like I wish I could give you back what you want what you never got Waidley sets a tone of regret that many of us can recognize in our own breakups PERIOD Whether you are the dumper the dumpee or just someone looking for a good cry this song will give you all the feels PERIOD

Drew Barrymore by SZA

Natalie Whalen Film Editor

I judge a song by how easy it is to cry to and SZAs Drew Barrymore was my favorite song released last year PERIOD Not only is it highly resonant for all my ladies and gentlemen who have ever felt underappreciated lessthan or unsure about their feelings towards a past or present significant other it is a tearsoaked certified jam PERIOD For best listening pour yourself a glass of wine and turn up the volume all the way so that you cant hear your choked sobs as you sing along PERIOD Remember theres a Drew Barrymore in all of us  and we all deserve more love than were often given PERIOD

How To Disappear Completely by Radiohead

Matthew Holman Entertainment Editor

If the title of this track is any indication this is quite the distinct vibe PERIOD Rather than just paint the simple portrait of longing for a lover or heartbreak Thom Yorke and crew have wrought an extenuated mural of a song portraying the simple yet endlessly complex feeling of wanting to hide from the world after making a mistake with that special someone PERIOD Yeah PERIOD Deep PERIOD This ones best coupled with reflecting out of a rainy windowsill and herbal tea to profoundly drain personal toxins or something like that PERIOD

Kentucky Rain by Elvis

Anubhuti Kumar Highlighter Editor

This song is so sad PERIOD This guys girl just leaves him out of the blue and he doesnt even know why PERIOD He obviously loves her  Ive loved you much too long PERIOD My loves too strong PERIOD To let you go never knowing PERIOD What went wrong And get this the guy is Elvis If theres no hope for Elvis what hope is there for the rest of us I am wrestling with this question and probably still will be as I cry to this song on Valentines Day PERIOD I know Kentucky Rain is sad and everything but it so catchy and melodious It is the kind of soothing that makes you feel better listening to Elvis buttery voice while also making you feel inadequate because of Elvis dynamic singing ability PERIOD Cue renewed waterworks PERIOD Clearly lots of feelings here PERIOD

This Bitter Earth by Dinah WashingtonMax Richter

Ryan Mikel Arts Editor

The title says it all PERIOD This song is so depressing that it appeared in three major motions pictures of the last decade Shutter Island Arrival and Disconnect. it is a melancholic arrangement for strings juxtaposed against the great Dinah Washingtons soulful surveillance of this in fact bitter earth we inhabit PERIOD Lyrics like today you are young too soon you are old make you question your very own existence and my life is like the dust that hides the glow of a rose gives you all the feels PERIOD Who hurt you Dinah

Vienna by Billy Joel

Kristina Hayhurst Deputy News Editor

Billy Joels Vienna is the perfect song to put on during the small hours after dawn and before daylight PERIOD Its the only time when reality escapes you and for an hour or two youll actually believe you can leave your apartment hop on a plane and move to Austria PERIOD Its only when the sun comes up that youll realize you are alone with no money and already late to class PERIOD

WALLS by Kings of Leon

Natasha Roy EditoratLarge

This song makes me tear up a little every time I listen to it and sometimes I have to skip it when it shows up on a playlist PERIOD You can hear how heartbroken Caleb Followill is when he sings WALLS. the last time the chorus is sung really shows his full emotion and you cant help but feel for him when you listen to it PERIOD The bass drum also gives the feeling of a heartbeat throughout the entire song and honestly Im just a mess by the end of it PERIOD

Wicked Game by Chris Isaak

Yasmin Gulec Features Editor

As soon as the song starts and you hear Chris Isaaks heartbreakingly beautiful voice you will feel a couple of tears slowly streaming down your cheeks PERIOD The world was on fire and no one could save me but you. lets be real here a song about losing someone you love and feeling like they are the only ones for you is a sensation worth crying about and there is no better person that understands this pain than Isaak does here PERIOD The coolest thing about the song is how it was written PERIOD Isaak got a call from a woman he liked but also knew was toxic for him PERIOD She wanted to come over and talk to him and right after he agreed he started writing the song PERIOD He was so inspired that by the time the woman came to his apartment Wicked Game was finished PERIOD Knowing someone is bad for you but loving them anyway is one of the most painful things the human heart can experience especially on Valentines day PERIOD

With or Without You by U2

Emily Fagel Theater and Books Editor

With or Without You is the quintessential looking out the window while it rains and youre sad song PERIOD I dont know about you but hearing Bono repeat and you give yourself away  times really gets the tears flowing PERIOD This song is also featured in an episode of Friends and Ross and Rachel basically taught me what love is so theres an extra layer of sentiment there PERIOD
