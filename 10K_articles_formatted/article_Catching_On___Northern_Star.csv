By  Jarrod RiceSeptember  

Britt Davis stepped to the line of scrimmage like he had done thousands of times in his life but this time was different PERIOD

Not because he was playing the first college snap of his life PERIOD Not because he was in front of a crowd much bigger than most NFL crowds PERIOD

No Britt Davis who has played football his whole life was stepping up to play at Michigan in front of  people and on national TV at a position he learned only two weeks earlier PERIOD

Davis was a quarterback in high school and until Saturday a quarterback in college PERIOD That was until NIU coach Joe Novak approached Davis about the opportunity to get on the field as a wide receiver PERIOD

It was one day before practice when coach asked me if I was interested the Broadview native said PERIOD My No PERIOD  goal is to do anything to help the team and I felt confident I can get the job done. phil Horvath was named the starting quarterback this fall after winning a battle for the position that dated back to last spring which meant Davis had to choose between running routes or settling for a backup role PERIOD

Although Davis had the confidence of his coach as well as his own the fact remained he had never been on the receiving end of a pass in a game PERIOD

But even his lack of experience was no concern to Davis PERIOD He finished with two catches for  yards against Michigan

I was too excited to be nervous about it Davis said PERIOD I felt comfortable and was excited to be on national TV PERIOD It really got my blood flowing. davis threw for  touchdowns and  yards his senior year at RiversideBrookfield High School PERIOD He said his experience at quarterback has helped him make the transition PERIOD

Being a quarterback helped me a lot at receiving Davis said PERIOD We kind of had a feel of how wed want to run routes. physically Davis switch to wide receiver is a natural fit PERIOD Davis is 6foot3  pounds and runs one of the quickest 40yard dashes on the team PERIOD

Britt is just too good to be on the sidelines Novak said PERIOD He is one of the best athletes on the team PERIOD I wish I had three Britts PERIOD We could put one at safety. davis also has the advantage of having family suit up with him on game days PERIOD

Sophomore tight end Brandon Davis is Britts older brother but dont expect his big brother to tell him how its done PERIOD

You know what my brother is a gogetter so I didnt really need to tell him anything Brandon said PERIOD He knew what was expected of him and he knew what he needed to do. brandon added he is happy to have his brother on the field even hes not under center PERIOD

Hes a very talented quarterback and he could play anywhere he said PERIOD I would love to have him be our quarterback but thats not his role right now Phil is our guy. britt is still taking reps as the No PERIOD  quarterback in practice and said that part of his career isnt over but with the Michigan game under his belt he is prepared to get plenty more time at wide receiver  at least this season PERIOD

Right now its where I help the team most Britt said PERIOD Im just happy to be on the field PERIOD I dont care if its at wide receiver quarterback or kicker. even with Britt taking reps with the first and second team in practice Novak isnt worried about the amount of work PERIOD

He works up an appetite Ill tell you that Novak said PERIOD
