After sleeping on park benches in Houston and escaping the sting of northern Philadelphia winters by riding on SEPTA buses until asked to leave Joseph Martinez said Penn State is the most stable home he has ever known PERIOD

Though the university has been a place of refuge for Martinez seniorinternational politics and economics his new home has come with a price PERIOD

When he graduates in May  hell be more than  in debt PERIOD

A fallingout from home left Martinez a Houston native without a bed to sleep in twice during his adolescence  once as a 15yearold boy in Houston and then again as a 17yearold student in northern Philadelphia PERIOD

At one point his search for a place to rest his head even led the then15yearold to settle for the roof of a Houston elementary school he said PERIOD

Martinez eventually moved to Philadelphia to live with his cousin and fellow Penn State student Isak Handal PERIOD

Joseph is a hardworking person and determined for success Handal seniormedia studies said reflecting both on his career at Penn State and his memories of his cousin from their time together at Kensington Capa High School PERIOD He always knew he had to focus and find something better outside of Philadelphia. when he finally arrived at Penn State Martinez considered his new home too good to be true. but within the first hours of arriving on campus that feeling of comfort faded and Martinez said he felt as though he did not belong PERIOD

I thought someone was going to ask me to leave he said saying the schools mostly white student body made it difficult for him to feel like he fit in PERIOD

Martinez worked through the initial hesitation though and now is setting his goals high as he continues his academic career at Penn State PERIOD Having once spent a summer backpacking through Guatemala to Panama he said he wishes to attend graduate school and someday return to Central America as a political leader PERIOD

Despite his ambition there is one thing standing between Martinez and his goal  the cost of tuition PERIOD

Without any financial support from family footing the bill for the education he desires is especially difficult he said PERIOD

And though he is a resident of Pennsylvania Martinez said the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency has consistently turned him down for grants PERIOD

Senior Director of the Office of Student Aid at Penn State Melissa Kunes said the federal government strictly regulates the guidelines for both Penn State distributing federal aid and for PHEAA distributing Pennsylvania state grants PERIOD

The law ties our hands Kunes said PERIOD The federal government tells us what the financial makeup looks like. the only tuition assistance Martinez receives is from Penn States Office of Student Aid he said PERIOD

To keep his place at Penn State Martinez waits outside the Shields Building before the registration deadline for each semester talking to officials about the financial options available to him for dealing with his bills PERIOD

The challenge also carries over into his academic life too PERIOD Martinez said he is not able to register for classes until hours before the deadline because of outstanding charges on his bursar account PERIOD

Though he doesnt know how he will continue paying for his education Martinez remains both positive and hopeful PERIOD

I have God to thank he said PERIOD
