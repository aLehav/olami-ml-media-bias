Over  people gathered at St PERIOD Eugenes to watch Pope Francis address Congress during his first visit to the states PERIOD 
Until the recording of the speech froze the Pope with a hand raised in midsentence PERIOD
Deacon Mike Zboyovski took over standing in front of the TV with a stillmotionless Pope reading from a transcript of the speech PERIOD
Ill try to continue in my best Argentinian accent he joked PERIOD
The Pope spoke on a wide variety of issues including religious extremism immigration and refugee crises and the imbalance of wealth PERIOD
All of us are quite aware of and deeply worried by the disturbing social and political situation of the world today the Pope said PERIOD Our world is increasingly a place of violent conflict hatred and brutal atrocities committed even in the name of God and of religion. people from many different churches were welcome at this interfaith event to build connections and hopefully bring about change PERIOD 
The Creation Care Alliance a program of Mountain True partnered with St PERIOD Eugenes to host the event said Jane Laping a member of the steering committee PERIOD 
There is an organization called NC Interfaith Power and Light PERIOD We partner with them Laping said PERIOD It was their suggestion that we wait until the Pope was in the U.S PERIOD to hold the event to give people a chance to read the encyclical PERIOD We were creative and this is what we came up with. after the speech concluded Steve Runholt the pastor of Warren Wilson Presbyterian Church held a service PERIOD In keeping with the themes of Pope Francis speech Runholt invited two speakers during the service to tell their stories PERIOD 
The way forward on these issues is not debate the way forward on these issues I believe is through story and through relationship PERIOD Meeting people who differ from me has changed my life hearing their stories has changed my experience and my perspective Runholt said PERIOD We created some space tonight to hear some stories from people whose lives are touched by these issues especially climate change and environmental issues. the first speaker Ernestino Martinez told the audience of his childhood in El Salvador and how the landscape of his home country was torn apart by war PERIOD
Before the war everything was really pretty it was a beautiful life PERIOD We were fishing in the river we played in the sand by the riverside beautiful times PERIOD But everything changed when the war started Martinez said PERIOD The mountains and the valleys they mined all the land around it PERIOD You couldnt go back to the mountains the mines will kill you or at least take a part of your body. throughout the 12year war  pounds of bombs and gases were dropped PERIOD It greatly affected the fish population and the soil quality PERIOD Previously no chemicals were needed to grow corn but now the land wont produce any crops without the help of chemicals Martinez said 
We live now in a country with a lot of land a lot of mountains beautiful scenery but we have to take care of it of what we are going to leave behind to our generations Martinez said Im very happy knowing that there are people who stand up and illuminate the torch for others in this world. the next speaker Deke Arndt a climatologist originally from Oklahoma spoke about the Dust Bowl of the 1930s and how it continues to affect the people of Oklahoma generations later PERIOD
There was brokenness on several levels brokenness with an angry climate system brokenness in the way we treated the world around us and brokenness in the way we treated each other. arndt said PERIOD This event happened before climate change so why am I telling a story from  years ago Its because this same story is going on right now in Syria PERIOD The Syrian issue has all the same elements. the Pope also spoke about the Syrian refugee crisis in his speech PERIOD
Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the second World War PERIOD This presents us with great challenges and many hard decisions PERIOD We must not be taken aback by their numbers but rather view them as persons seeing their faces and listening to their stories trying to respond as best we can to their situation the Pope said To respond in a way which is always humane just and fraternal PERIOD We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays to discard whatever proves troublesome. arndt related the refugee crisis to issues in the climate system PERIOD 
The drought in Syria has been exacerbated over the past five years by temperatures that have not been seen in the Middle East Arndt said PERIOD That causes more water to evaporate precious water from the Euphrates which feeds the streams and farms of eastern Syria. when the flow of the Euphrates was cut off by the Turkish dam system it deprived thousands of young Syrians of water and work Arndt said PERIOD 
He also brought up multiple other issues of climate change PERIOD 
Many Bangladeshi farmers have moved away from the coast because rising sea levels are destroying their crops PERIOD Alaskan villages are being evacuated because the ground beneath them is thawing PERIOD
We have an environment with which our relationship is breaking PERIOD At the same time we have a relationship with those who we havent met that we are connected to through our actions on the climate system Arndt said PERIOD Those who havent been born the decisions we make today the things we do today the things we observe today will affect people that we will never meet or be born long after we die. the people in attendance were encouraged to try to make change in their own organizations PERIOD 
Irma Howorth who was in attendance said she is committed to doing what needs to be done PERIOD
We cant have healthy people on a sick planet Howorth said PERIOD I believe in doing my share PERIOD Carpooling eating vegetarian growing your own food recycling buying bulk and taking short showers. steve Runholt said he just hopes that the Popes visit and the meeting at St PERIOD Eugenes have sparked inspiration for action PERIOD
I hope its a game changer I hope it changes the conversation about climate change Runholt said PERIOD I hope that people especially politicians who insist on denying the reality of it are no longer able to do that convincingly PERIOD I hope this event builds bridges of relationship and cooperation. the Student Voice of UNC Asheville
