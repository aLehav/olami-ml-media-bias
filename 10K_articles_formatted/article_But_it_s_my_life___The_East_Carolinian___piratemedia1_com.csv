Partly cloudy skies PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Its so nice to finally be back in my element  school work and parties PERIOD Ive had at least one test in every class a few papers due and more reading assignments than I can handle PERIOD Ive been very stressed out lately having headaches not sleeping well and having a difficult time focusing on anything PERIOD I have a hard time talking about my feelings PERIOD You know the ones that come straight from your heart the honest to God truth and the ones that you just dont want anyone else to know PERIOD Ive found it very helpful to write out my life it helps me understand my situations from a different view PERIOD Im very talkative about most anything except my innermost thoughts my heart to brain talks and my occasional all too crazy nights out with my girls PERIOD So my entries begin as I explore myself and try to bring new meaning to my life PERIOD

We had our entire lives planned together PERIOD After we graduated college we were going to get married maybe have kids and live happily ever after I dont know what I was thinking at the time PERIOD Could this fairytale life of mine really come true Would we become one of those rare couples who were high school sweethearts then got married and stayed together forever

My curiosity and love for life changed all that with one simple yet devastating statement  Breaking up with my boyfriend of three years broke my heart into a million pieces PERIOD Many asked if it hurt me so badly then why did I do it I have sat and wondered the same thing and as clich as it sounds I wanted to experience the real college life I felt like I was being held back PERIOD

This may sound selfish so Ill say I was holding him back too he just couldnt realize it PERIOD He said that he felt like I owed him an explanation so quickly I racked my brain to find only blanks PERIOD I had no other choice than to let my heart do a little talking PERIOD Although I was happy and content on the outside I felt like we werent exploring ourselves enough because it was always  not  or  College is a time for self development and personal growth PERIOD So I guess you could call that  As for me it was a little on the bs side PERIOD

At first it was difficult to escape my once  life PERIOD Not talking to him everyday was making me go crazy PERIOD  my friends keep telling me PERIOD It really hurts but I know I made the right decision PERIOD My alltooserious relationship was also filled with jealousy stress and gradually turned into constant bickering PERIOD It took a huge part of my heart to finally end things with him and the time that followed was miserable PERIOD I realized how much time we actually spent together as I found myself at home alone watching television on Friday nights PERIOD I miss seeing his face kissing his lips and even hearing him say my name PERIOD My nerves are really bad not allowing me to get too much sleep at night but the sickening feeling finally went away PERIOD

My boyfriend was great and I really believed that he was  But after seeing how much fun everyone had last semester I just wanted to go out too but he always wanted to stay in PERIOD We built a great bond with each other we passed a challenge in life many struggle with to love someone and possess the courage to let them love you back PERIOD Of course I thought I made a mistake but Im a strong believer in fate PERIOD If we are supposed to be together then our paths will meet again PERIOD Its true that we cant always see what we need so maybe this is a blessing in disguise PERIOD
