Alerick Soularie  during game against Belmont on Tuesday April   PERIOD

There were only three scoreless innings in Sundays rubber match between Tennessee and Mississippi State PERIOD It was a backandforth game as the Bulldogs took the  win over Tennessee to improve to  in SEC play PERIOD With the loss Tennessee falls to  PERIOD

We need to find a way to get it done Tennessee head coach Tony Vitello said PERIOD There are no medals being handed out to these guys for second place Were able to beat teams like that PERIOD Were able to beat teams like Vanderbilt We need to find a way to get it done. for the eighth time in nine games Tennessee scored in the opening inning PERIOD Andre Lipcius got the scoring going by doubling down the leftfield line plating Justin Ammons PERIOD After Al Soularie singled Pete Derkay picked up his fifth RBI of the year on a groundout PERIOD

Soularie turned in a solid performance at the plate going 4for4 with a double and an RBI PERIOD

Just seeing the ball Soularie said PERIOD Relying on my hand speed and I was reacting to the fastball. it wouldnt take Mississippi State long to respond as Rowdey Jordan led off the third inning homering to right field PERIOD

Tennessee answered with a run of its own in the bottom half of the third PERIOD Keegan James hit both Jay Charleston and Lipcius before Soularies single gave the Vols a  lead PERIOD Tennessee got a runner on third with oneout in the inning but failed to get him in due to a pair of groundouts PERIOD

Tennessees starting pitcher Will Neely ran into trouble in the fourth inning as he gave up three straight singles to lead off the inning PERIOD The third one scored a run but Charleston was able to throw a runner out at third for out number one PERIOD Neely was able to pick up out number two but then hit Dustin Skelton to give the Bulldogs a pair of baserunners PERIOD

Jordan was the next batter and he hit a hard line drive that hit Neely in the ankle PERIOD The play loaded the bases for Mississippi State and ended the day for Neely as he exited the game due to injury PERIOD

The injury is a deep bruise on his ankle and the senior is questionable to make his start next weekend against Georgia PERIOD

Will Heflin came in in relief and walked in the game tying run before getting Brad Cumbest to ground out to end the inning PERIOD

Will didnt come in and throw strikes right away and thats what he needs to do Vitello said PERIOD Hes not a power pitcher PERIOD Schultzy Andrew Schultz Lingo Zach Linginfelter those guys have stuff they can back it up with if they dont throw the first punch but a couple times this weekend we didnt do that. tanner Allen gave Mississippi State its first lead of the day in the fifth inning taking a twoout  pitch deep for a solo homer PERIOD

The Bulldogs extended the lead in the sixth inning PERIOD Andrew Schultz hit two Mississippi State batters before Jake Mangum doubled down the right field line pushing the lead to  PERIOD

It seemed like the Vols may have been done after the two run inning but Zach Daniels wouldnt allow it as he launched a moonshot two run homer to pull Tennessee back within one PERIOD

Tennessee wasnt done on the inning getting runners on the corners with nobody out thanks to a Bulldogs throwing error and a Max Ferguson bunt single PERIOD Tennessee couldnt capitalize though as Jake Ruckers bunt didnt go far enough to allow the runner to get home and Connor Pavolony chopped one to the pitcher who caught Ricky Martinez in a rundown securing the second out of the inning PERIOD

Those arent baserunning misexecutions Vitello said PERIOD Those are situations where our hitter didnt get the job done PERIOD Our guys going on contact. the failure to even up the game in the sixth came back to bite the Vols as Mississippi State tallied one more run in the eighth inning which was good enough to secure the  win PERIOD

Tennessee returns to action Tuesday night when the Volunteers host Lipscomb at Lindsey Nelson Stadium PERIOD
