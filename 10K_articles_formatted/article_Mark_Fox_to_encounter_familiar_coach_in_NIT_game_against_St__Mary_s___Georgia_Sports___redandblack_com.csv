Coaching any game against any opponent is difficult PERIOD But when that team has a coach who knows whats going through your head at any given moment during a game that task becomes much more difficult PERIOD

When Georgia   SEC plays St PERIOD Marys   WCC on March  during the second round of the National Invitation Tournament thats exactly the challenge that Georgia head coach Mark Fox faces PERIOD

Hell probably be able to coach our team better than I can Fox said PERIOD

He is St PERIOD Marys assistant coach David Carter PERIOD

Carter and Fox worked with each other on Lynn Nances coaching staff at the University of Washington in the early 1990s PERIOD Then Carter was Foxs associate head coach at the University of Nevada from  to  PERIOD

When Fox took the job as the head coach at Georgia in  Carter became the Wolf Packs head coach PERIOD He coached there for six seasons and compiled a  record with two postseason appearances PERIOD

Having worked closely with Fox for so long Carter knows the way Foxs brain works throughout a game PERIOD

This guy knows exactly how I think Fox said PERIOD He knows all the tricks in the bag most of them anyway. although St PERIOD Marys and Georgia have never played each other on the basketball court Carters knowledge of Foxcoached teams creates a game that is similar to a conference game PERIOD

Often times in a league game the scouting is so intricate and detailed that this game wont be unlike a lot of games late in the year where teams really understand each other Fox said PERIOD

Even though Carters knowledge possibly gives St PERIOD Marys an advantage in this game Fox said that this point in the season there isnt enough time to make any strategic changes PERIOD

He also added that the time change when traveling to California for this game plays into that PERIOD The Bulldogs didnt arrive in Moraga until  a.m PERIOD on Saturday March  PERIOD
