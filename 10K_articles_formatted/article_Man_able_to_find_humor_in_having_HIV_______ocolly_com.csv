CHICAGO  If you think theres nothing funny about hemophilia or HIV Shawn Decker thinks youre probably not much fun yourself PERIOD If he can find the humor in either disease then quite frankly so can you PERIOD



 he said recently while in town to promote  his wry selfdeprecating book about growing up during the early AIDS era as a  and   terms he coined to replace labels he dislikes i.e. such as  and 







At  Decker has outlived his original prognosis by almost  years and he feels well enough in spite of bouts of fatigue to race around the country with his wife Gwenn Barringer promoting his book he was on the way to the fifty-eighth Annual Hemophiliac Convention in Philadelphia where he claimed to be receiving the Best Nosebleed Award which does not actually exist and on this day downing a cheeseburger and a glass of wine at Naha PERIOD He passed when offered a green salad PERIOD  he joked PERIOD



But back in  at age  Decker says that he was kicked out of sixth grade in his rural Virginia hometown when he was diagnosed with the then relatively unfamiliar HIV the result of tainted bloodproduct treatment for his hemophilia which had already turned his childhood into a hothouse life of trips to the doctors office and dangerous nosebleeds PERIOD



When he was finally allowed back on the premises to start seventh grade police were parked out front for some reason and a flier was distributed announcing that a student with the AIDS virus was enrolled PERIOD



As if junior high werent excruciating enough PERIOD



 Decker said with an apparent lack of selfpity PERIOD 



Also he added 



On the other hand Decker vowed the day he returned to school he would never talk about HIV again  a 12yearolds heartbreaking attempt to protect himself PERIOD Which didnt stop him from wondering  he said PERIOD During those early years 



The vow of silence lasted a full  years  eight years longer he notes in the book than anyone thought he would ever live and much longer than a huge percentage of HIVpositive  of his generation who died as a result of tainted blood long before treatments were available in  Decker himself wasnt diagnosed with AIDS until  PERIOD



But when he finally opened up about his condition at age  his life opened up too in amazing ways PERIOD



 he said of the sudden turnaround which hit him like a death sentence in reverse He had to prepare himself for the fact that he was going to live PERIOD
