5985,2023-07-11,"longhorn Legislative Aides an organization within Student Government has been helping college freshmen get acquainted with the  Acres for  years and now transfer students in their first year at UT are welcome to apply PERIOD

SG president Colton Becker and vice president Mehraz Rahman said they knew they wanted to open LLA to transfer students when creating their platform last year PERIOD They met with LLA codirectors Nikita Telang and Ricky Cooks as well as the Transfer Students Agency throughout the summer to make it happen PERIOD

A representative found in the SG constitution that the LLA program is to be open to all firstyear students nutrition senior Becker said PERIOD Its actually in the constitution PERIOD Its been overlooked for years. becker said the proposal initially received pushback  transfer students may be older than their sophomore directors or already have the skills the program teaches  but they are glad the program is now more inclusive PERIOD

There was a concern that the culture was meant for people who are first entering college in general and not for people who have already been to college in some form said Rahman a Plan II and marketing senior PERIOD But many of these experiences are the exact experiences they havent had and  would be helpful for them entering UT. lLA accepts  students each year who are mentored by the executive board SG assembly members and LLA alumni as they learn how to write legislation fundraise for different organizations and engage in service projects PERIOD

LLA provides all sorts of avenues for you to explore the things youre passionate about in your first year at UT psychology sophomore Telang said PERIOD We encourage students to use the program and its resources as a way to find yourself and what you love on this campus. while Becker said some in SG have previously been resistant to change Telang said they are happy to take the executive board and other agencies advice in this new chapter PERIOD

When Ricky and I were chosen as directors one of the things we promised ourselves was to have the best interest of the LLA program at the front of our minds Telang said PERIOD We wanted to make sure that we were not making this decision blindly and really took the time to educate ourselves on the issues transfer students face here on this campus. telang said she expects the program to be just as professionally and socially enriching as before even as it shifts and expands PERIOD

Both Ricky and I are excited to work with any new development or change for the betterment of the program Telang said PERIOD The qualities of being an LLA include a desire for a deeper integration within student government and that can benefit all students. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",SG organization opens applications to transfers â€“ The Daily Texan,University of Texas Austin
