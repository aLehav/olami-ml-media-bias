Jaylen Johnson and Ryan Bowman combine to sack Cal quarterback Ross Bowers PERIOD

 PERIOD The Death Row Defense is suffocating

If you read the box score for the game yes the Huskies did hold the Bears to  yards rushing PERIOD Granted the Bears lost  yards on the final play of the game on a botched field goal attempt but the Huskies run defense was absolutely suffocating PERIOD Californias leading rusher would turn out to be Derrick Clark who rushed for just  yards on  carries with starters Patrick Laird and Vic Enwere combining for just  yards behind Clark PERIOD

 PERIOD Hunter Bryant is the next ASJ

Yeah Im fine with making this comparison this early in his career PERIOD In Austin SeferianJenkins freshman season with the Huskies he caught  passes for  yards and six touchdowns becoming a prime red zone target for the Huskies at the time PERIOD Just six games into his UW career Hunter Bryant has  catches  receiving yards and one touchdown PERIOD If Bryant can continue his high level of play further into the Pac12 schedule he could become a prime staple in the Huskies offense like ASJ was PERIOD

 PERIOD The pass rush in particular played a big role for the dominant defense

Another contributor to the Dawgs holding the Bears to negative  yards was all of the Huskies sacks against redshirt sophomore quarterback Ross Bowers PERIOD Bowers would officially finished with nine carries with a net loss of  yards with eight of those carries coming from sacks PERIOD Junior Tevis Bartlett led the way for the Dawgs with two sacks but the entire defensive line ended up contributing to a sack one way or another against the Bears PERIOD If the Huskies can continue to generate pressure without sending too many guys this is a defense thats going to be tough to score on for anyone PERIOD

 PERIOD Vizcaino may be out of a job and Soderberg could be the Huskies shortguy

Head coach Chris Petersen said that there is definitely still competition at the kicking spot but its becoming fairly apparent that the funk that senior placekicker Tristan Vizcaino is in isnt going to be an easy fix PERIOD And worse despite Vizcainos struggles Petersen hasnt committed to redshirt freshman Van Soderberg meaning that neither has separated themselves from the other at least beyond  yards PERIOD Soderberg looks like he will be the guy from short distance and the jurys out on whether or not the Huskies will bring out a kicker on fourth down from  yards out for the rest of the season PERIOD

 PERIOD Late start times didnt seem to affect attendance but remain a big topic of discussion headed into next weeks game against Arizona State

After a lot of hoopla over the late start times this year for the Huskies and Petersens comments about the late times being painful the late kickoff didnt seem to affect the  fans that attended the  p.m PERIOD game PERIOD And after ESPN color analyst Kirk Herbstreit said that the Pac12 should be thankful for ESPNs coverage and the exposure that the network brings these talks certainly wont die anytime soon as much as coach Petersen and Pac12 Commissioner Larry Scott wants them too PERIOD With another  p.m PERIOD kickoff against Arizona State next Saturday the debate will most certainly rage on between west coast fans and Pac12 and TV network leadership PERIOD
