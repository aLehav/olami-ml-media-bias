The Utah and Tennessee tennis teams met for the first time on Sunday but for the 56thranked Utes the wait wasnt nearly long enough PERIOD The No PERIOD  Vols  who played host for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association KickOff Weekend won every point sweeping Utah  in a  win PERIOD

The 12thranked pair of junior Boris Conkic and freshman Rhyne Williams set an easy pace for the match defeating Utahs Timmy Allin and Jason Smits  in the No PERIOD  doubles matchup PERIOD

Junior JohnPatrick Smith and senior Davey Sandgren played a much closer match against Phillip Eilers and Alex Golding at the No PERIOD  position but eventually pulled away to win  PERIOD

Conkic said the teams doubles victories made it easier for the Vols to take control in the singles matches PERIOD

I think we started off well in doubles Conkic said PERIOD And then we carried that momentum into singles. williams the nations No PERIOD  player was the first to take advantage of that momentum dispatching the freshman Golding in a   victory at the No PERIOD  position PERIOD

Freshman Tennys Sandgren from the No PERIOD  position and Conkic from the No PERIOD  soon followed with their own   victories against Smits and sophomore Benito Suriano respectively to end the match PERIOD

Conkic said the quick wins by the Vols would be an advantage as they faced the South Carolina Gamecocks Monday for a chance to advance to the next round of the ITA Indoor Championships PERIOD

We got three quick wins which is always good in a tournament system he said PERIOD Tomorrow we have another match and its good to be ready for tomorrow and be rested. smith agreed saying his early control of his match against Eilers at the No PERIOD  spot enabled him to work on a few issues before facing the Gamecocks PERIOD

Towards the end of the second set  I started taking a few more risks in my serve so I can work on a few more things for tomorrow he said PERIOD Smith won the match   PERIOD

Conkic who with Sundays victory has started the spring season with eight straight wins said his success has come from maturity PERIOD

I just think that Im more mature maybe PERIOD Im a junior this year he said PERIOD I think my game is starting to be more solid. although Tennessee had already wrapped up the victory in its first four matches Smiths singles victory which earned the Vols their fifth point of the match gave him his twentieth victory of the spring season a number he said will hopefully continue to grow as the season progresses PERIOD In comparison Smith had  singles and doubles victories for all of the  spring season PERIOD

Junior Matteo Fago in the No PERIOD  spot defeated Stephen Jacobs   and senior Matt Brewer wrapped up the match by beating Allin   at the No PERIOD  position PERIOD

Vols head coach Sam Winterbotham said the success the team experienced Sunday should help them heading into their match against South Carolina on Monday PERIOD

Any time you can jump out and get ahead in these matches it builds momentum Winterbotham said PERIOD We did a great job of that today. the Vols faced the No PERIOD  Gamecocks Monday at  p.m. and although the Vols lead the alltime series  Winterbotham didnt believe it would be easy PERIOD

Theyre extremely talented he said PERIOD We know them very well PERIOD They know us very well PERIOD It should be a good match. editors Note The UT tennis team  defeated South Carolina  on Monday in the finals of the ITA KickOff Weekend in Knoxville Tenn PERIOD Smith led the Vols fourthstraight shutout of the season by tallying his ninetieth career win PERIOD
