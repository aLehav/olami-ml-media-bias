What do you get when you combine entrancing hiphop drum loops with gruff and edgy speechrap vocals all laid down on a bed of audio clips from pornographic films and news broadcasts

If you said insanity award yourself  point PERIOD

But BroadcastQuality Belligerence  the latest release from techrappers NonAggression Pact may also be the salvation of industrial music PERIOD

According to the press release from ReConstrictionCargo Music Florida programmer Jeff Hilliard and vocalist Jason Whitcomb have reunited in response to fans who have waited three years for a followup to their first release 9mm Grudge  PERIOD

Whitcombs rap n snarl poetry reveals his pessimistic view of human emotion PERIOD The lyrics to  dont mince words 

The dark undertones are wellhidden beneath Poeesque drum beats and techno sounds that range from synthesized pulses to Glockenspiel bells PERIOD

But its hard to overlook the lyrics on songs like  where Whitcombs distorted voice breaks through the calm funky beats to say 

So when NAP veers into familiar popindustrial territory dont get too comfortable  Whitcomb always returns to the weird using distorted rap vocals over music you swear you used to hear on Nintendo PERIOD

Dont be fooled by the Crystal Methodinspired introduction to  where the phrase  is repeated over and over again PERIOD

The song however doesnt stay predictable for long dissolving into Whitcombs effectsladen and raspy vocals which are robotic and often difficult to understand PERIOD

This album has taken on the vocal qualities and quirky beats of Stabbing Westward and Nine Inch Nails while adding danceable beats and so many humorous samples you cant hear them all in just one listening PERIOD

Its a pleasing combination that makes for a rare success PERIOD

And if the repetition of the sampled word  on the track that bears its name catches your ear youll understand where these guys are coming from PERIOD Any group that samples the voice of the peons in the PC game WarCraft has to be cool PERIOD
