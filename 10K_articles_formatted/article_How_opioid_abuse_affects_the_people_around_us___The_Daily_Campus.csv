Everyone hears about substance abuse butnot everyonefaces the true facts of the matter PERIOD In recent years opioid addiction has destroyed lives with no mercy PERIOD Unfortunately there are more cases in this state than more people can fathom PERIOD

One group on campus however recognizesthe issue PERIOD This semester theWGSS2255 class focused their activism work on substance abuse specifically opioid addiction PERIOD According to The National Institute on Drug Abuses  study Connecticuts rate of opioid related overdoses of . people per 100000was twice as high as the national rate PERIOD The students in the class decided to combat this and created the Connecticut Partnership Against Drugs CPAD focusing on resources for prevention PERIOD Last nights panel was just a small taste of the several events they have hosted PERIOD

The class invited three people to speak Sandy Valentine Stephen Feathers and Mike Augustine PERIOD

Valentine leads the University of Connecticuts Recovery Community PERIOD She has personal experience with long term recovery from alcoholism driving her passion to help those around her PERIOD Valentine now serves as a certified CCAR Recovery Coach Academy facilitator and is working on getting certified as a Recovery Coach Professional PERIOD

Feathers is an outreach worker for Perception Programs Inc working to bring recovery with cooccurring substance use and mental health problems PERIOD Feathers also provides Narcan training and distribution runs the Windham Syringe Exchange encouraging safe use for those who partake and guiding them through the journey of recovery PERIOD

Augustine is a licensed marriage and family therapist and licensed alcohol and drug counselor PERIOD He also served as the department head of MATS Services for Recovery Network of Programs for  years and counting giving him  years of experience in the field PERIOD

The panel discussed basics of opioid abuse but because of the diversity in their backgrounds was able to take the discussion in many directions PERIOD

Since the main focus of CPAD is prevention and recovery the panel spent some time talking about signs of opioid abuse PERIOD Common signs include weight loss nodding out pinpoint pupils and isolation PERIOD Augustine used the idea of isolation to talk about the stigma around the whole issue of opioid addiction PERIOD

Its all about stigma Augustine began PERIOD He then explained the many layers of stigma involved PERIOD The first layer of course is substance abuse in general PERIOD Beneath that comes the stigma of the drug being abused PERIOD Finally there is a layer of stigma surrounding the idea of injection PERIOD Augustine explained how injecting opioids is looked down upon more thansubstance abuse in general PERIOD He explained how this creates a feedback of isolation that drives the victim into a deeper hole of addiction PERIOD

When the panel was asked about how they are able to see addiction in a victim Valentine had interesting insight PERIOD

Everyone has a different level of bottom she said PERIOD She discussed how different situations different identities etc PERIOD play into the addiction PERIOD She concluded by saying the problem becomes an addiction when the victims life becomes unmanageable PERIOD

Another point that was discussed was how addiction itself is the driving force of addiction PERIOD Sometimes when a victim is addicted and recognize their problem they do not quit PERIOD It is not necessarily because they do not want to it is the fear of withdrawal thepain of leaving their dependency on a substance PERIOD

Of course there are many other conditions and situations that get in the way of recovery one of those being mental health which was also a big topic for the night PERIOD The panel all agreed that undiagnoseduntreated mental issues and opioids prescribed for pain management bring about the deepest holes for victims PERIOD This is where cooccurring treatment or treating issues simultaneouslyis one of the keys to recovery for victims PERIOD

Recovery brings a setof tools to avoid slippery places Valentine said summing up the message of prevention from the panel and CPAD as a whole PERIOD
