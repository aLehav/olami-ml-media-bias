Once in a while an extraordinary show takes TV to new heights PERIOD But few pundits predicted that last season Lost a castaway serial from J.J PERIOD Alias Abams  would be that show PERIOD Throw in some scifi elements a huge ensemble cast and weekly cliffhangers and it seemed like a recipe for disaster PERIOD Yet something compelled America to tune in PERIOD Whether it was the excellent performances or the engrossing mysteries of the island Lost became the watercooler sensation that ABC needed yes there was also that Desperate something or other too PERIOD

For those few who missed out the first time around or who just need a refresher to catch Hurleys lotto numbers Lost arrives on DVD PERIOD

Heres the premise An Oceanic Airlines flight traveling from Sydney to Los Angeles crashes on a seemingly deserted tropical island PERIOD The survivors band together and slowly learn to adapt not only to island life but to each other PERIOD Using a unique structure that incorporates extended flashbacks into each episode viewers learn more and more about the textured pasts of every castaway PERIOD From heroic M.D PERIOD Jack Matthew Fox Party of Five to the conniving con man Sawyer Josh Holloway PERIOD When it works  as is the case in the stellar Walkabout episode when alphamale Locke Terry OQuinn Alias is revealed to have been wheelchair bound  few series are better PERIOD But sometimes these tangents seem to be filler to round out otherwise thin plots PERIOD

The DVD set contains pristine transfers of the hidef broadcasts PERIOD More importantly it is loaded with extras PERIOD Beyond the standard commentary tracks is an extra disc packed with documentaries and featurettes PERIOD It breaks the series down from preproduction the actual construction of the individual episodes to the audience response PERIOD Viewers learn that Jack was supposed to die in the pilot and that most of the characters were based on the actors who auditioned PERIOD It even includes hilarious screentests PERIOD

Lost embraces the strengths of its medium in its serialization and large scope PERIOD Even though the revelations arent as shocking the second time around every episode is still an enthralling adventure PERIOD Just as you prepare to find out whats down the hatch in season two remember what brought the castaways together in the first place PERIOD
