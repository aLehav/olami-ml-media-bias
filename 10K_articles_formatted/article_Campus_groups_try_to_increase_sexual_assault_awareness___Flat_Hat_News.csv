8423,2023-11-05,"at a university that tops higher education rankings situated in a town with higher tourism rates than crime rates it may come as a surprise to some students that the term date rape surfaced on a national scale after an incident at the College of William and Mary PERIOD

The front cover of the  issue of TIME Magazine featured a dark image of Katie Koestner  and her story of sexual assault at the College PERIOD

The national media coverage that Koestners incident of sexual assault generated placed the issue directly on the shoulders of the College community often creating conflicting results PERIOD

While Koestners freshman Resident Advisor and the campus police supported her the Dean of Students at the time urged Koestner to get back together with her assailant PERIOD A trip to Earl Gregg Swem library even found Koestner staring at graffiti referencing her on a bathroom stall PERIOD

Since the  incident the College has implemented a specific response protocol to incidents of sexual assault PERIOD Beyond policy the College currently has four oncampus groups directly geared toward reducing incidents of and educating students about sexual assault PERIOD Eric Garrison who acts as a health educator within the Dean of Students office and advisor to Every Two Minutes and  in  and coadvisor to Health Outreach Peer Educators defines sexual harassment as using ones gender as a means of assault intimidation or threat PERIOD

I dont think that its a coincidence that  in  was established at the College in the years following this incidence President of the William and Mary Chapter of  in  Cem Pence  said PERIOD After the incident the administration probably felt a need to increase the awareness of sexual assault on campus. nearly  years following Koestners incident the battle to educate about and reduce sexual assault continues and it remains a prevalent issue on campus PERIOD According to College sexual assault statistics women aged  to  experience the highest per capita rate of intimate partner violence with  percent of College women reporting surviving rape or attempted rape PERIOD

I think that now the university is doing a wonderful job dealing with incidents of sexual assault Garrison said PERIOD The policies are in place and the resources are here PERIOD But its not just the job of one person one office or one vice president its something the whole campus has to pull together to do PERIOD You can do everything you can and no matter what you do things can still happen PERIOD We are doing the best we can with the resources we have. in a recent email to the entire student body Vice President of Student Affairs Ginger Ambler  Ph.D PERIOD  alerted the campus community of an incident of sexual assault PERIOD An unidentified suspect approached a female student on Harrison Street grabbed her and struck her buttocks repeatedly with an open hand PERIOD The student immediately called William and Mary police but the suspect was not found PERIOD

Some students still misunderstand the definition of sexual assault and thought the student overreacted PERIOD

I feel like what the man did was inappropriate but calling the police may have been going a little too far PERIOD Im not sure you could even be arrested for that PERIOD Maybe student affairs could have dealt with it Charlie Clark  said PERIOD

Typical sexual assault incidents take place in a partying environment which may downplay the severity of cases outside the norm PERIOD

A lot of incidents of sexual assault occurs within the drinking culture and would look bizarre or out of place in other settings Pence said PERIOD

Sexual assault advocacy groups still battle against the perception that the issue is no longer relevant PERIOD In response most groups have chosen to change the way their organizations work PERIOD

One campus advocacy group which originally formed to combat sexual assault at the College nearly disbanded this past year due to dwindling members PERIOD William and Mary Sexual Advocacy Prevention Advocacy or SAPA downscaled to four members but managed to recruit and regroup for the upcoming year PERIOD Their main purpose is to provide students information advocacy and a safe haven for members of the community who have experienced sexual assault or harassment PERIOD

While some campus advocacy groups have chosen to recruit more heavily others have consolidated to expand their resources PERIOD

In response to alarming sexual assault statistics College groups such as Sexual Assault Peer Advocates HOPE Every Two Minutes and the Student Assembly have teamed up to create the College Sexual Assault Awareness Week from March  to April  PERIOD The week includes profitshares to raise money for sexual health and advocacy groups on campus educational speakers and film screenings PERIOD

There is a tendency for the issue of sexual assault to slip peoples minds and this week serves as a reminder of how important the issue is Pence said PERIOD

HOPE is a studentrun organization that works with the Office of Health Education and the Student Health Center to provide community health information with a focus on sexual assault. while their main educational seminars occur during freshman orientation HOPE aims to spread education about healthy lifestyles throughout the year PERIOD

Two other sexual health awareness groups  in  and Every Two Minutes hold seminars for freshman halls during orientation and provide funding throughout the year to various groups PERIOD

 in  an allmale group is dedicated to preventing rape on College campuses and educating students about sexual assault focusing on how male students can help prevent such incidents from occurring PERIOD Every Two Minutes is a branch of the SAPA group and serves a similar function to  in  except that it bears a female perspective PERIOD

The educational aim will soon enter the classroom bringing with it the possibility of college credit PERIOD Starting in spring  William and Mary health educator and advisor to SAPA Eric Garrison will teach a class entitled Introduction to Understanding and Preventing Sexual Assault PERIOD The twocredit course will be a prerequisite for membership in SAPA and be taught seminar style focusing on a theoretical approach to sexual assault and forms of gender violence PERIOD

Sexual assault is not a womens issue its not a mens issue its a human issue Garrison said PERIOD Its not something we should leave up to one gender or group to be responsible for PERIOD We can all be survivors and we can all be agents of change. the student immediately called William and Mary police but the suspect was not foundWhen seconds count cops are only minutes away PERIOD Allow students to exercise their second amendment rights so they dont become victims
