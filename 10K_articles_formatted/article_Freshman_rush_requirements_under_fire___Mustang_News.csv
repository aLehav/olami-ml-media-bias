Director of Student Life and Leadership Stephan Lamb confirmed there are currently conversations occurring about plans to change this system whether that means removing the deferred recruitment policy for fraternities or changing sorority recruitment to match the policy PERIOD

It doesnt make sense to have a difference in policy Lamb said PERIOD Regardless of what we do I want to engage students in the dialogue. since the enactment of deferred recruitment for fraternities the NorthAmerican Interfraternity Conference NIC has pressured the university to roll back the restrictions PERIOD The Interfraternity Council IFC supports this position arguing that deferred recruitment is detrimental to the greek system according to Lamb PERIOD

The NIC believes that open membership is one of the cornerstones of the American experience and that should not be denied Lamb said PERIOD

The NIC took a handsoff approach at first to Cal Poly implementing deferred recruitment but later began asking for the policy to be dropped PERIOD Last year according to IFC president Jason Colombini the NIC requested the university change the deferred recruitment policy but no formal proposal was submitted so no action was taken PERIOD

This year Colombini plans to turn these requests into a reality PERIOD

Its one of my priorities this year as IFC president and I think its really hindering the potential of the greek system he said PERIOD

Cal Poly President Jeffrey Armstrong was actually one of the first to discuss changing the deferred recruitment policy Lamb said PERIOD He recently expressed to Lamb his wishes to make sorority and fraternity recruitments consistent with each other though Armstrong did not specify whether he would prefer the abolishment of deferred recruitment or its implementation for sororities PERIOD

He would like to see consistency at Cal Poly and not have it differentiated by gender Lamb said PERIOD

According to Lamb the solution must be found this winter to allow enough time for fraternities and sororities to prepare because the new rules would go into effect for next years fall recruitment PERIOD

Colombini said he plans on putting together a task force comprised of himself and four other fraternity presidents to help take action on the matter PERIOD He has been in contact in the past weeks with the NIC in order to establish a formal proposal to give to the university PERIOD

The policy of deferred recruitment was implemented in the wake of the tragedy of Carson Starkeys death in the hopes that prohibiting students from rushing during the fall of their freshman year would allow them time to adjust to the college lifestyle PERIOD

There is a concern that because of the immediacy of the rush experience students get placed in an organization that may or may not be consistent with their values Lamb said PERIOD

The reasons behind this disparity between fraternity and sorority recruitments are many but center around the fact that sorority recruitment as a whole has historically been more organized and prescripted by the National Panhellenic Council according to Lamb PERIOD

Fraternities have a very different culture that surrounds them and they really function as independent organizations without the benefit of this overarching structure Lamb said PERIOD

Theres more freshmen not showing up because they dont realize that you can still go meet people in the fraternities and build that base for winter he said PERIOD

 Comments

As a member of the Greek community I am not surprised how this article and many others in regards to Greek Life at Cal Poly seem to ignore the third council united Sorority  Fraternity Council PERIOD This council does not have deferred recruitment for first time freshman and actually has  fraternities that Freshman can rush and pledge in the Fall PERIOD By ignoring this council that is comprised of Cultural based and interest fraternities and sororities it gives a sense that we are not considered real Greeks. by creating these articles it sends an idea that freshman men can not join a fraternity fall quarter hurting our recruitment efforts PERIOD The reason that our council is different is that we have a dry pledge process PERIOD If a pledge of my fraternity is found to use alcohol or drugs they are dismissed from the process as we find academic achievement cultural awareness and true brotherhood above all PERIOD This is the main reason that our council was not hurt by the deferred recruitment PERIOD I would make sure future articles include who we are and what our small council represents PERIOD I do hope Cal Poly can remove this rule sanction on IFC council as a member who belongs to NIC but is in USFC we should all be given the same opportunity PERIOD In brotherhood PERIOD

I remember my first beer

Growth in a fraternity is a paththe longer your in it the more youll grow as a person

Thats laughable

How grown up were those upper classmen who encouraged Carson Starkey to drink enough to to die

Fraternities and sororities love to sugarcoat their purpose PERIOD  According to them they exist to help young men and women transition into adulthood and leadership roles in society  Last time i checked The real world is nothing like what goes on in the greek world PERIOD The greek world mostly consists of drunken debauchery judging people for superficial reasons and trying to fit in so badly that you pay a bunch of money so that you can feel accepted PERIOD

There are a lot of good people in cal polys greek society but they didnt become good people because of their involvement in greek life PERIOD  I would love to see drug testing as a requirement for any fraternity or sorority that wishes to be school sanctioned PERIOD Itd be interesting to see the results  Haha

To Sam

I love how you generalize all Greeks with one picture PERIOD No two organizations are the same and no two individuals are the same PERIOD What happened to Starkey was a tragedy but I do not expect your narrow minded reflection of the Greek system to understand who we are and what we believe in PERIOD There are drug and alcohol requirements for some Fraternities and Sororities but you obviously failed to read my first response PERIOD Before you make any future post I would fact check PERIOD Something so little people like yourself fail to do PERIOD

You make it seem like the only people who party and drink are Greeks when in reality the majority of College students do that on their own or with clubs and other organizations PERIOD The only difference is that we have letters across our chest and society seem to love to picture us in bad nature PERIOD It is sad that one wrong action by a few individuals overshadow all the good the Greek system does for the community PERIOD But then again I wouldnt expect you to understand that either PERIOD

Fact check Dont generalize and open your mind PERIOD

Victor

it is not my obligation to read your response as i was responding to the article not you PERIOD So you cant fault me for not reading your first response PERIOD

I agree with you that not all fraternities and sororities are bad and its my fault for not stating that in my first response PERIOD There are good greek organizations but i believe that for every good one there is at least one bad one PERIOD

Some of the most obnoxious behavior that happens in the college environment is the result of these bad greek organizations PERIOD They are the ones who give you all the stigma of being jackasses PERIOD

Your right those letters across your chest are the reason that you guys are pictured in a different way because you represent an organization an organization which claims to build leaders and help the community PERIOD So when members of said organizations act in foolish ways it reflects negatively on the whole group PERIOD  If i go out and drink myself stupid and get arrested that is me making a fool of myself because of my own bad decisions but when a greek organization promotes behaviors which are equally bad it reflects poorly on the whole  organization PERIOD  I mean if a group claims to be helping students grow it would seem hypocritic if they also promote destructive activities

As for my statement on drug testing as a requirement there are currently no school drug testing policies for greek involvement so i didnt make any false statement PERIOD My statement was that i think that it should be a school mandate for every member of the cal poly sactioned greek society to be drug tested PERIOD Assuming that our future leaders arent doing any drugs this shouldnt bother you right Except you and i both know that a decent percentage of the involved students would have trouble passing PERIOD

I guess to sum it up the main point i am trying to present is that students will grow into productive members of society with or without greek involvement being involved in the greek society doesnt make you better than anybody else You may feel better about yourself because you are part of a group but in reality growing into a leader is something that you do individually as a person not because you are part of a club

Sounds like Sam didnt get a bid PERIOD

Sounds like Sir is just a fraternity brother who is upset that somebody pointed out the legitimate flaws in their system PERIOD

I have never even attempted to join any sort of Greek organization PERIOD I think its funny that just because we have different opinions you jump to the conclusion that I must have been rejected from a fraternity PERIOD Some people are going to like you and some people arent thats just the way life goes

There are many logical fallacies in this article PERIOD First Id like to point out that the Carson Starkey alcohol poisoning tragedy is a polarization and extreme example of fraternities PERIOD Not all fraternities force their new recruitment to drink PERIOD This is merely pointing out an extreme case which was very unfortunate that was a rare occasion PERIOD It is also a hasty generalization to say that all fraternities are bad because of this it is a small sample size and so itd be unfair to rush to such a harsh conclusion PERIOD However that support fraternities have fallacies as well PERIOD A lot of times you hear about how grades suffer dramatically that you practically go on academic probation by joining your first quarter theres really no evidence to support that. in response to this quote I know many people whose grade have dropped because theyve joined is that not evidence Growth in a fraternity is a paththe longer youre in it the better youll grow as a person. this is a non sequitar there is no evidence that fraternities make you a better person Im sure theres evidence for and against this PERIOD
