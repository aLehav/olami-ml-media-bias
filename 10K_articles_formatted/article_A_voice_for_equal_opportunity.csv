5201,2008-04-05,"in response to concerns that have been raised regarding conditions of accessibility on campus UCSU is working to ensure that students with disabilities are receiving the same opportunities as their peers PERIOD

On Thursday Legislative Council unanimously approved the second reading of a bill that would create a Disabilities Access Task Force in charge of monitoring all students ability to enjoy the programs and education offered at CU PERIOD According to the bill this committee will be responsible for researching and communicating all issues of disabilities access PERIOD

Authored by Triexecutive Hadley Brown and Matthew Beres the UCSU codirector of city and neighborhood relations the bill also says that the task force will work with all university entities that affect disabilities access such as Facilities Management and Parking and Transportation Services PERIOD

From UCSUs perspective we would be making the task force the primary advocates and researchers for disabilities access on campus said Brown a senior English major PERIOD We want to make sure that everyone has the same access to education here. brown said there were several problems that lead to the creation of this task force including the presence of handicap parking spaces on eighteenth Street that are not compliant with the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act PERIOD Two accessible spaces had originally been removed from that area by the construction of the Fine Arts building PERIOD

Other concerns include uneven sidewalks that are not sufficiently cleaned of snow and ice and certain entries to buildings equipped only with stairs PERIOD

Disabilities access should be incorporated more into campus construction plans Brown said PERIOD

Making up the Disabilities Access Task Force will be at least two members of Legislative Council up to four students at large and the UCSU director of diversity affairs PERIOD

Dustin Farivar vice president of Legislative Council and one of the bills sponsors said the purpose of having such a group is to create new conversations in making sure there is an equitable level of access for all students PERIOD

They can initiate any projects or concerns they have and they will be supported by UCSU to make sure we are serving the needs for students with disabilities on this campus said Farivar a junior political science major PERIOD

Farivar said in the past working with Disabilities Services has provided advocacy for students with both physical and nonphysical disabilities but that the issue of disabilities access needs even more attention PERIOD

We need to make sure  PERIOD we are always considering student safety when it comes to capital construction projects Farivar said PERIOD We have to make sure we are ADA compliant. cindy Donahue the director of Disabilities Services said she welcomes the idea of having a studentled task force further address the issue of disabilities access PERIOD

I applaud the student group and the more people who are paying attention and bringing issues forward the better she said PERIOD

Donahue also said Disabilities Services has just finished a survey addressing the concerns of students with disabilities on campus PERIOD She is hoping the results will be put into a report by the end of the semester at which point it becomes an open record that the task force may consult PERIOD

People put a lot of time and energy into answering questions she said PERIOD Hopefully this group will research to find out what already exists and enhance it. it was not only disabled students but ablebodied students as well who recognized some of the problems with disabilities access on campus PERIOD

Roy Dodgers a 22yearold junior communications major said ramps and elevators are not as conveniently placed in buildings as they should be PERIOD

I could see it as being difficult because the shortest distances between classes involve stairs he said PERIOD

Brown said there has already been interest among students for serving as representatives on the task force PERIOD She believes the task force is a step in the right direction toward correcting these problems and accommodating all students PERIOD

When students really take on an issue and fight for it it really makes a difference she said PERIOD Thats the purpose behind this. contact Campus Press Staff Writer George Plaven at george.plavencolorado.edu PERIOD
