The D.C PERIOD Council is poised to pass a bill that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana in the District PERIOD

The Simple Possession of Small Quantities of Marijuana Decriminalization Amendment Act of  was introduced by mayoral candidate and councilmember Tommy Wells DWard  and councilmember and former Mayor Marion Barry DWard  in July PERIOD It seeks to eliminate criminal penalties for those caught with less than one ounce of marijuana and to reduce the fine to  PERIOD The current penalty is a sixmonth jail sentence a permanent criminal record citation and a  fine PERIOD

The bill is supported by six other council members  Anita Bonds DAt Large Jim Graham DWard  Jack Evans DWard  Kenyan McDuffie DWard  Mary Cheh DWard  and David Grosso IAt Large  and needs seven votes out of  to go to Mayor Vincent Gray for approval PERIOD If Gray signs the bill it must receive congressional approval PERIOD

To collect more information Barry and Wells who is chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety held two rounds of hearings this week during which the public had the opportunity to speak on the issue PERIOD During these hearings Gray publically announced his support of marijuana decriminalization for the first time PERIOD

I support decriminalization Gray said PERIOD Legalization is another issue PERIOD Im not there on that issue yet. wells attributed the need for decriminalization to the racial implications of marijuana arrests in the District PERIOD According to Wells approximately  percent of people arrested in D.C PERIOD on marijuanarelated charges are black PERIOD

Its simply not fair he said PERIOD Not only is it not fair these people who are charged with penalties are unable to find employment because of their criminal record PERIOD Its not smart. grosso who in September introduced his own legislation to completely legalize marijuana in the District agreed PERIOD

Racial disparity is high in issues involving illegal drug possession Grosso said PERIOD Its not a matter of being illegal anymore PERIOD Its a means through which decriminalization is funnelled and its a failure of our war on drugs. barry drew from his own personal experiences to support this point PERIOD

D.C. made national news headlines in  We arrested  people predominantly AfricanAmerican for mere possession of marijuana Barry said PERIOD

Councilmembers expressed particular concern about the consequences faced by those convicted of marijuana possession PERIOD As marijuanarelated arrests are listed as permanent criminal records students arrested for possession become ineligible to apply for financial aid and arrests have similarly grave consequences for adults PERIOD

Thousands of people are being stripped of their healthcare benefits becoming ineligible to apply for jobs and unable to apply for housing Wells said PERIOD This has to change. supporters of the bill pointed to research on the limited effects of marijuana on health PERIOD

Scientific knowledge of the effects of marijuana has increased dramatically over the past few years and now we know that marijuana is no more harmful and addictive than alcohol Deputy Attorney General for Public Safety Andrew Fois testified PERIOD

According to Fois marijuana is the third most used substance in the United States with alcohol and tobacco first and second respectively PERIOD Fois reported that  million people were reported to have used marijuana in the past year PERIOD

A Gallup report released Tuesday showed that  percent of Americans currently support the legalization of marijuana a significant increase from  percent in  when the question was first asked PERIOD

Specifically D.C PERIOD Cannabis Campaign Chairman Adam Eidinger reported that  percent of District residents support decriminalization with  percent supporting legalization of marijuana in general PERIOD

Furthermore Grosso pointed to the fact that marijuana decriminalization is quickly becoming a national trend PERIOD Over the past  years  states have already decriminalized the use of marijuana to some extent PERIOD Washington and Colorado passed initiatives that legalized marijuana in November  PERIOD

Despite this push toward decriminalization Grosso emphasized the importance of discouraging marijuana use for juveniles and students PERIOD

Above all we need to educate the young and constantly send the message that marijuana is still dangerous and addictive even if we decriminalize it Grosso said PERIOD

Fois agreed and said that although he supported the bill it needed to preserve some aspects of the original penalties such as maintaining smoking marijuana on sidewalks in parks or in other public spaces with children present as a criminal offense PERIOD

Nevertheless Grosso who has historically been one of the Districts most fervent advocates for the complete legalization of marijuana said he would continue to push for the legislation he introduced to the D.C PERIOD Council in late September PERIOD

The bill is not going to be radical and legalize marijuana but its definitely a huge first step in making legalization happen and Im going to continue pushing for that Grosso said PERIOD
