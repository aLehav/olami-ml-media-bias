8142,2022-10-05,"assistant Podcast Editor Andrew Rosin  offers an inside look at UMass Amhersts Berkshire Dining Commons asking for himself the eternal question How good is it really

Amherst College is not known for its food PERIOD UMass Amherst on the other hand recently earned the distinction of having the countrys Best Campus Food according to the Princeton Review PERIOD UMass is no stranger to this award  marks the sixth consecutive year that they have topped the rankings PERIOD So with the countrys best dining hall food just a fiveminute drive from Amhersts campus what student wouldnt be curious as to what makes UMass the king of college dining And more importantly is the food as good as everyone says it is Last Friday two of my fellow gastronomes and I decided to try it for ourselves PERIOD

To gain access to the Berkshire Dining Commons  one of UMasss four dining halls  one either has to pay  per person or find a UMass student who is willing to part with one of their Guest Swipes. after ruling out the first option my friends Joe Sweeney  Ziji Zhou  and I loitered outside the entrance before intercepting three freshmen who generously agreed to swipe us in PERIOD Useful tip Freshmen are more likely to have remaining Guest Swipes than upperclassmen. and with that the cornucopia that is the Berkshire Dining Commons was at our fingertips PERIOD

We completed two full laps around the expansive dining hall before deciding what to order noting the elegantly flowing buffet tables and classy raisedtable seating arrangements PERIOD Reflecting on his first impression of the dining hall Joe recalled It smelled great PERIOD Ambiance was great PERIOD It was very wellconstructed  I would say there was very much a highclass elegance. in agreement Ziji added that it did not feel like a school cafeteria. eventually though our appetites overwhelmed our curiosity PERIOD Berkshire Dining Commons has a seemingly endless and sometimes overwhelming selection of available foods  on Friday night we could choose from the rotating Chefs Table which was serving pork chops and white fish a sushi bar a madetoorder stir fry station wonton bowls an international cuisine station offering chicken tikka masala and naan and of course the classics salad bar pizza mac and cheese and herbroasted chicken PERIOD As Ziji noted the fact that the pizza and mac and cheese  staples at Valentine Dining Hall  remained largely untouched in a remote corner of Berkshire told us everything we needed to know about the difference between UMass and Amherst dining. lastly one cannot forget about the dessert options bread pudding pear cobbler cranberry bars and walnut brownies PERIOD

Amherst students familiar with UMass dining often describe the stir fry as epitomizing the larger schools superiority and it did not disappoint PERIOD Following Zijis lead I ordered a stir fry  choosing my preferred veggies and protein  and watched as one of the two stir fry chefs prepared it in front of me PERIOD Together with warm white rice available in adjacent rice cookers I ate what was easily the best meal that I have had in the past five weeks PERIOD In addition to the fact that the stir fry was hot off the pan the flavorful sauces fresh vegetables and tender chicken combined to form what I would declare a college culinary masterpiece PERIOD

Ziji however was not as impressed with his stir fry PERIOD While his specific complaint concerned the lack of variety in stir fry sauces  the only options being soy sauce and hot sauce  he pointed out that he was thinking of the longterm experience of eating at UMass Eating it once is great PERIOD Twice  great PERIOD Three times  good PERIOD Four times  not as good anymore PERIOD Five times  OK PERIOD Its the same flavor with different ingredients in it which is going to taste the same. joe who sampled the pork wonton  comprised of broth lo mein and vegetables  in addition to the stir fry and pork chops said that his only complaint was that the pork tasted a bit dry and that the bacon relish did not saturate the pork. other than that eating at UMass was basically the greatest moment of my life in the past trimester Joe reported PERIOD

The UMass students that I talked to on Friday night echoed Zijis opinion of the UMass dining experience PERIOD Ruby a sophomore at UMass Amherst told me I feel like Berkshire Dining Commons definitely loses its appeal over time PERIOD Last year I feel like it didnt but even this year its a really nice rotation and all of the food is really good but it still is a rotation PERIOD So I feel like I get used to it. ziji and Ruby touched on a universal human experience When one eats a certain food enough times  even something as delicious as a UMass Amherst stir fry  it eventually loses its appeal PERIOD This phenomenon is described by the Wundt Curve named after German philosopher Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt which maps pleasure as a function of novelty PERIOD As the Wundt Curve predicts experiences that lack novelty will lead to boredom and displeasure PERIOD

My takeaway then is as follows How good a college dining hall is on an absolute scale does not matter as much as how well a dining hall curates an interesting and varied selection of meals PERIOD Caseinpoint Even the famed UMass dining hall gets old after a time PERIOD To create a pleasurable dining experience the ability to choose from a wide variety of options becomes critical I think you have to make sure youre switching up where youre going and what youre getting PERIOD Because if you get into a routine it does kind of feel stale UMass sophomore Shane Williams explained PERIOD

As we left UMass feeling so full from our multicourse meal that we did not even sample the dessert options I asked Ziji and Joe for their final ratings PERIOD Ziji trying to provide an objective rating hypothesized that arriving to UMass on an empty stomach might have clouded his judgment of the food  he arrived in a hot state as behavioral scientists would describe it PERIOD Ziji ultimately rated his meal a respectable  out of  while Joe rated his meal an impressive  out of  PERIOD

Joe in responding to Zijis rating questioned What is the utility of the judgment That is what purpose does it serve to find reasons for critiquing the meal Why not focus on enjoying the experience If you want the most accurate rating of the food free of any bias then Zijis response is likely more reliable PERIOD But if you want the rating that captures the joy of eating at Berkshire Dining Commons then Joes  out of  is surely the better rating PERIOD
