8641,1970-01-01,"tapingo is an online service that among other things allows students to place an order at a number of locations in advance and then arrive later to pick that order up the idea being that while using this app you shouldnt have to wait in a line PERIOD According to their website Tapingo currently partners with about  college campuses around the United States PERIOD At NC State Tapingo offers quick pickup for over  locations PERIOD

In general the service does what it says it will do PERIOD Most times Ive used it I havent had to wait in line at all for my food and the user interface was easy enough to use PERIOD Still there is one problem I have with Tapingo at NC State that isnt exactly obvious which is that it worsens the wait time for food during rush hours PERIOD

Its easiest to view this problem from an economic standpoint PERIOD Economists generally view lines as undesirable based off the idea of supply and demand PERIOD If a business has a line that means they have more demand than they are able to supply at one time PERIOD The idea being that you could be charging more for your product if you constantly have lines PERIOD

Felix OberholzerGee a professor at Harvard Business School points out in a Freakonomics interview that lines are essentially ways to deal with shortterm fluctuations in demand. this gets to the idea of Tapingo being a problem during rush hours which are by definition shortterm increases in demand PERIOD You can see for yourself that during these periods there are longer lines at any food court than the rest of the day PERIOD

Tapingo allows the user to bypass these lines by ordering online PERIOD When you order using Tapingo at NC State your order is printed on a yellow receipt for the employees to make skipping all those who are waiting in line PERIOD Just to clarify this isnt the problem with Tapingo this is just the actual function of the app skipping lines PERIOD

Its the side effect of skipping lines that causes the problems PERIOD Part of the benefit of lines forming during times of high demand is to deter people PERIOD If a line is too long you wont wait in it if you have a choice PERIOD For food you might go find somewhere else to eat that has a shorter line or wait until the line settles down at the place you want PERIOD

In this way demand for food during rush hours can be spread out to more restaurants and over an longer period of time so that everybody doesnt have to wait as long PERIOD

Tapingo at NC State changes this dynamic PERIOD

Tapingo makes it where the most desirable food is ordered in excess because the line that would normally hold you up from getting that food does not apply to you PERIOD It also constricts rush periods into smaller amounts of time seeing as most people get hungry for certain meals at certain times and they dont have to worry about lines using this app PERIOD

This effect increases the wait period for everybody not just those who dont use Tapingo PERIOD Restaurants cant restrict the input of Tapingo orders and therefore can get backlogged easily having to wait until after the rush period to catch back up PERIOD Even people who order their food online during this period have to wait for it PERIOD

There have been several instances at Talley where even after ordering my food in advance online I still have to wait for it to finish PERIOD

Unless you decide that you want to eat your food earlier or later than usual there really is no way around these backlogs unless you happen to be lucky enough to order your food right at the start of the rush period PERIOD

Overall at NC State Tapingo is a great idea for ordering food almost every time during the day except lunch and dinner when restaurants that normally receive a rush of customers over a period of time now receive even more customers in a shorter period of time because of the app PERIOD This backlogs orders for everyone even those who order online PERIOD

Nobody likes waiting in lines but lines certainly have their benefits PERIOD They organize demand into a manageable concept and usually do a decent job of making it where people dont have to wait terribly long for their food PERIOD Everyone wants their food as fast as possible but it would be best for all of us at NC State if during the typical lunch and dinner rush orders you didnt order using Tapingo PERIOD
