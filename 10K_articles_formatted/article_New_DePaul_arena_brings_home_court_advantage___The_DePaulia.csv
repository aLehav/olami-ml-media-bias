After years of searching for the perfect spot to set up shop DePaul settled on McCormick Place for its mens basketball programs final destination PERIOD The Blue Demons at the commencement of the  campaign will play their home games in a 10000seat 173million multipurpose events center PERIOD

Part of Elevate Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuels . billion tourism and trade show infrastructure redevelopment project  announced at a press conference at McCormick Places Skyline Ballroom May   the new DePaul arena is the next step in the universitys plan to reassert itself as a basketball force PERIOD

Our goal is to be a firstrate collegiate program and this gives us the ability to do that said DePaul President Rev PERIOD Dennis H PERIOD Holtschneider PERIOD

DePaul will contribute  million to the proposed stadium  which will have a variety of other uses ranging from holding concerts to city college graduations  with the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority MPEA adding its own  million and  million coming from public taxes PERIOD Some money has already been earmarked based off of the new Big East 12year TV contract with Fox Sports PERIOD Prepared financial statements list ticket sales fundraising and naming rights as key contributions PERIOD

What is expected to be a vibrant urban entertainment center the elements of Elevate Chicago are meant to jump start Chicagos historic Motor Row district PERIOD The planned stadium will provide the wherewithal and the facilities to have general session space at the same that it also provides a lively neighborhood according to Jim Reilly CEO of the MPEA PERIOD

We couldnt afford it ourselves just as DePaul couldnt afford to build a basketball arena all by themselves said Reilly PERIOD By working together in a really classic private partnership it comes closer to the truth that DePaul is actually subsidizing us than vice versa. the mens team will continue to play at Allstate Arena  where the school has a contract until   and will extend its contract on a yearbyyear basis until the new venue is ready PERIOD DePaul has played its home games at Allstate since the arenas inception in  moving from oncampus Alumni Hall for greater exposure and better facilities PERIOD

Negotiations of the arena deal will reportedly have DePaul spend  on rent for each of the mens teams  home games and  per womens game PERIOD

Holtschneider said the United Center gave a gracious offer of free rent for  years but said operating costs would have made the deal less financially favorable than the schools current contract with Allstate PERIOD

The problem was that because of their other tenants they couldnt offer us practice time said Holtschneider PERIOD It was just a difficult place to build for a straight collegiate program under those constraints PERIOD If I paid for the whole project myself Id have to raise my students tuition too PERIOD

By the time we bring together the resources from the Big East ticket sales a number of donors  we can put together this deal in a way that doesnt increase the cost of education. this building and what it can do for our program gives our basketball team a chance to be a positive P.R PERIOD tool for this great institution and thats exactly what we intend to do said mens head coach Oliver Purnell PERIOD

In addition to the projected  million cost of construction and land acquisition for the events center boutique hotel and entertainmentdining venues at McCormick Place Elevate Chicago includes plans for redevelopment at Navy Pier PERIOD Planned renovations include the Childrens Museum and Maggie Daley Park PERIOD

Because DePaul has come in as a tenant on a longterm contract  we do not have to face an eitheror option said Emanuel PERIOD Because of this creative financing we do not have to pick between revitalizing and reenergizing McCormick Place or Navy Pier PERIOD We get to do both. there are and have been throughout DePauls history many opportunities where DePaul has rooted itself in a particular neighborhood to really enhance that neighborhood as well as providing a great educational opportunity said DePaul Athletics Director Jean LentiPonsetto PERIOD Wherever DePaul has put down roots whether its in Lincoln Park or the South Loop  DePaul has always felt a civic pride toward wanting to be about the betterment of the city of Chicago. dePaul reaction

At its core DePauls new stadium will prove to be enticing to high school basketball recruits PERIOD Transferring DePaul basketball from the more remote area of the Village of Rosemont to Chicagos South Loop immediately makes the schools program a more visible and viable entity PERIOD

Purnell who enters the fourth year of his sevenyear contract in  is optimistic about the arenas potential to positively affect recruitment PERIOD

Perception right off the bat it helps you said Purnell PERIOD I can tell you that already in talking about the possibility of building a place the real possibility and the likelihood  its helped us with recruiting and its helped us recruit Chicagoarea players. womens head coach Doug Bruno whose team has played on campus at McGrathPhillips Arena formerly the DePaul Athletic Center since  was particularly excited PERIOD Every day is a great day to work at DePaul PERIOD Todays a greater day to be a Blue Demon said Bruno on the day of the arena announcement PERIOD

The stadium will be eligible to host womens NCAA Tournament games when it opens but will not be able to accommodate games in the mens tournaments due to size restrictions PERIOD

Addressing criticism that DePaul could have built its own stadium closer to campus Ponsetto stated feasibility studies suggested otherwise PERIOD Given the property on campus DePauls footprint was not large enough to be able to construct an amenable facility PERIOD In order to remain in line with the other spectacular facilities available to other studentathletes at competing programs Ponsetto said an arena of this magnitude was a logical step in the right direction PERIOD

This is a really important opportunity for us to be able to elevate the program and to enhance our recruiting said Ponsetto PERIOD I think most of us would agree that the byproduct of that would be that we win PERIOD We think that winning is an important ingredient and an important component of the program and why we fund the program at the level that we do. transportation

Commuting to mens basketball games in Rosemont has long been an issue for DePaul students and fans PERIOD The estimated  minute drive with minimal traffic by fan bus offered by the school is a drawback on any game day especially to see a team that has struggled against conference competition for some time PERIOD Under Purnell the Blue Demons have a  Big East record  overall PERIOD

An arena in the South Loop gives fans a relatively easier destination to reach with moderate travel time see sidebar currently PERIOD But the transportation infrastructure to accommodate Elevate Chicago will still need to be altered for maximum efficiency PERIOD

Clearly if the arena is built there improved transportation will be vital said Jon Hilkevitch the Chicago Tribunes transportation reporter PERIOD The good news is there is already a  million Green Line stop planned in the redevelopment. that sites location is planned for just a couple blocks from the west entrance of McCormick Place PERIOD

Hilkevitch noted the proposed arena could learn from the United Center in its transportation infrastructure PERIOD The UCs glaring lack of a nearby CTA station is an oversight as driving remains the only option for many commuters creating unfavorable traffic conditions on game days PERIOD

I dont think we want to repeat that same mistake if theres an arena on the lake at McCormick Place said Hilkevitch PERIOD

Hilkevitch said improved bus rapid transit dedicated busonly lanes and special stations that allow for easy boarding are also important elements for faster more reliable service PERIOD Financially it could go for a tenth of the cost of the rail line. if we create a more efficient transit system where it makes sense to a family of four to hop on a Metra train come downtown and take an express bus to McCormick Place and the arena we would just have a much better system that would ensure people who made the trip would become regular customers said Hilkevitch PERIOD

DePaul will offer shuttles from both campuses and from the new Green Line stop on game days providing additional transportation options for students who opt not to take public transit PERIOD



Local reaction

Though Mayor Emanuel the MPEA and DePaul all promote Elevate Chicago as an overwhelmingly positive project for the city of Chicago the redevelopment has met its fair share of opposition PERIOD

One party against the arenas construction at McCormick Place is second Ward Alderman Bob Fioretti whose district includes the convention center area at Motor Row PERIOD Fioretti questioned whether DePauls publicprivate arrangement with the city is as beneficial to Chicago as it is made to seem PERIOD

Is this going to be the type of partnership we need to look at when we get funds to build an arena said Fioretti PERIOD Its questionable. fioretti was doubtful the arena would ever break even financially depending on recoup land costs and the buildings naming rights PERIOD A selfproclaimed strict steward of taxpayer money Fioretti did not think the project would broaden the tax base or bring in jobs necessary for economic growth in the city PERIOD

Stadium deals and use of public funds have not been that great in the city of Chicago said Fioretti PERIOD We are not even getting the Cubs any kind of tax breaks and they generate  million in amusement tax alone PERIOD Is it even a good place to put a stadium This is going to be a small amusement arena that will attract a lot of secondclass action. yet some taxpayers in the district seemed indifferent to the redevelopment even welcoming the prospect of bigger business and more attractions to liven up the neighborhood PERIOD

The neighborhood since weve lived here  which has been about  years  has been longing for more amenities for the residents such as restaurants and shopping among other things said Janie Urbanic  a resident on Prairie Street PERIOD So if the arena will help to bring that then Im all for it. colleen Crotty a 34yearold public school teacher and mother of two children was also accepting of the project PERIOD Despite stirredup controversy that taxpayer money is better spent improving Chicago Public Schools Crotty had no problem with her money funding Elevate Chicago. im happy for DePaul students and I think its a fine use of taxpayer money said Crotty PERIOD It will certainly serve a lot of people. though Urbanic endorsed introduction of the shopping and restaurants that will come in she was hesitant to commit her money to an arena that might not bring in as much firstclass entertainment PERIOD

Other than just having a lot of tax money go to build something thats not really utilized and doesnt really benefit us I think those are the only drawbacks said Urbanic PERIOD

Regardless of public opinion DePauls mens basketball team will be playing its home games in a new stadium starting in  a pivotal moment for the program PERIOD

Former Blue Demon and NBA player Bobby Simmons expressed his excitement following DePauls press conference May  saying the new arena is a great success PERIOD

Im very excited said Simmons who owns streetwear boutique store Succezz just a few blocks north of McCormick Place PERIOD This is great for the fans PERIOD Its something theyve been waiting on for a long time and having the opportunity to see it happen in front of their eyes is just a blessing. assistant sports editor David Webber contributed to this report PERIOD
