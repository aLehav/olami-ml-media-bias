Two years ago a  South Florida team came to Verizon Center and overcame a ninepoint halftime deficit in a win over a Georgetown team that had just thrashed No PERIOD  Duke and would go on to rout No PERIOD  Villanova three days later PERIOD

When South Florida freshman guard Anthony Collins hit a layup as time expired in the first half of Saturdays contest to cut the No PERIOD 14Hoyaslead to eight it looked like history might repeat itself PERIOD The Blue and Gray opened the second half on a  run however quickly putting to rest any talk of an upset as they cruised to a  win over the Bulls in the last game before Wednesdays primetime clash witharchrivalNo PERIOD  Syracuse PERIOD

We were down by more than eight a couple years ago and found a way to pull it off South Florida Head Coach Stan Heath said PERIOD Today just wasnt ourday. though theHoyas75point effort was their best since an  win over DePaul on Jan PERIOD  the story of the game was the hosts defense PERIOD Two years ago the Bulls scored  points in the second half alone but this time the Georgetown defense stood firm PERIOD The visitors endured a nearly 11minute scoreless streak in which they went 0of6 from the field and committed a staggering  turnovers PERIOD The impressive defensive effort helped theHoyasovercome some offensive struggles of their own as they shot a mediocre  percent from the floor in the opening period PERIOD

That number sparkled in comparison to South Floridas  percent mark though and the Bulls 15point first half had them on pace for a seasonlow in points PERIOD Both offenses were hindered by foul trouble for their point guards in the first  minutes as Georgetown sophomoreMarkelStarks and Collins  who averages five assists per game  both committed two early fouls PERIOD

We lost our point guard with a couple early fouls and  we played a strange lineup Heath said PERIOD We didnt have the decisionmaking andballhandlingthat wewanted. despite their defensive success the Blue and Gray were only up eight at halftime after enduring a barren offensive stretch of their own going without a field goal for  of the first half PERIOD TheHoyas though were careful not to let their lack of offensive success get to their heads PERIOD We were getting stops and we knew that the shots would start going in Head Coach John Thompson III said PERIOD If we defend and rebound everything else will beOK. we all felt that we werent scoring the ball but we werent frustrated at all because we were playing good defense senior guard Jason Clark said PERIOD We knew our shots were going tofall. and fall they did as Georgetown shot a scintillating  percent from the field in the second half en route to  points PERIOD TheHoyasdefense did let up a little bit allowing the Bulls to shoot a more respectable  percent from the floor but that appeared to be at least partially a function of the game turning into a laugher midway through the half PERIOD

I dont think we had better energy in the second half  the ball just started to go in Thompson III said PERIOD As with life as with basketball you make a couple shots it gets a lot easier to make more. the Blue and Gray were led senior center Henry Sims who had an impressive 13point ninerebound fiveassist performance PERIOD Starks bounced back from a trying first half to score ten points and later reflected on Georgetowns balanced attack that saw five players score in double digits  Sims Starks Clark  freshman forward Otto Porter  and freshman guardJabrilTrawick10 PERIOD

As long as guys are taking good shots and knocking them down scoring is going to be spread like that he said PERIOD Guys fell into a rhythm and shots were goingin. south Florida will attempt to get back on track against a resurgent Pittsburgh team on Wednesday but there is no doubt that Georgetown will be facing a much tougher test in upstate New York thissaturday PERIOD TheHoyaswon by eight in the Carrier Dome last year and can only hope that Stan Heath was correct in hispostgameassessment of the Blue and Gray PERIOD

TheHoyas were more talented last year Heath said PERIOD But theyre a better team now. hoya Staff Writer
