Miley Cyrus released her eighth album Endless Summer Vacation Mar PERIOD  PERIOD The album provides insight to Cyrus relationship with her partners her family and herself while experimenting with psychedelic pop and social commentary but ultimately sticking to the status quo PERIOD

Flowers Cyrus single released in January opens the album PERIOD The selflove anthem is catchy and beachy feeling reminiscent of Cyrus  album Younger Now. the song and its followup Jaded indicate what songs like Rose Colored Lenses and You seem to conflict with  the relationship is over and Cyrus couldnt be happier PERIOD

While Cyrus marriage to Liam Hemsworth ended in  it seems unfair to attribute every artistic move of Cyrus to her romantic partners or lack thereof PERIOD The rollercoaster of emotions listeners experience from Jaded with the lyrics Ill change my number but keep your Tshirt I dont mind its torn up and faded Im sorry that youre jaded to Rose Colored Lenses where she sings Wearing rosecolored lenses lets just play pretend Wearing rosecolored lenses pretend well never end is not all that unrealistic when it comes to experiencing heartbreak PERIOD The switch between the initial hyperindependent attitude of Flowers to the nostalgic feelings of You creates a relatable experience for Cyrus audience PERIOD

You is a ballad in which Cyrus gets real about what she desires in a relationship or rather in one relationship PERIOD She names a variety of adventures she would take only with you. cyrus mentions in the outro something she has publicly spoken about only minimally her faith PERIOD She sings I dont need Jesus cause baby you saved me Im done But only if its with you. the religious imagery is significant due to Cyrus past comments on her decision to leave the church because of its treatment of LGBTQ members  Cyrus has said she herself is pansexual PERIOD While it is unclear and arguably irrelevant if a queer relationship is the subject of You Cyrus positioning of her romantic partner above Jesus and their love above the concept of religious salvation is a bold lyrical choice offering social commentary in the midst of Cyrus heartbreak anthems PERIOD

The sixth track Handstand is a dreamy experimental sound for Cyrus clearly distinct from her typical pop style PERIOD The track is futuristic bordering on psychedelic pop with its synth sounds and Cyrus understated vocals compared to her typical grittiness PERIOD Its clear this was a leap for Cyrus but its one that paid off  Handstand is the standout sound of the album despite Cyrus lacking lyrics PERIOD

Prior to the release Cyrus revealed the album is divided with the first half representing morning and the second half representing night PERIOD Handstand seems to act as the buffer between the two with a distinct shift being made with River. river delivers the danceability that Flowers promised representing the partygirl lifestyle that Cyrus has so heavily been associated with PERIOD She leans into this further in Violet Chemistry with the lyrics And the lights come on but you dont want to leave Stay awhile stay awhile with me and again in Wildcard with Dont wait for me Cause forever may never come Im a wildcard. unfortunately the songs blend together  not just in content but in sound PERIOD

Aside from the demo version of Flowers Endless Summer Vacation ends with Wonder Woman a sweet serenade dedicated to the women in Cyrus family PERIOD In theme with the rest of the album Cyrus admires the strength of her mother and grandmother taking the album to a subtle close PERIOD

In her lengthy music career Cyrus has dabbled in hip hop country pop and rock but seems to have settled on playable easylistening pop music PERIOD Overall Endless Summer Vacation is likely exactly what existing fans of Cyrus were hoping for but it fails to draw in a new audience PERIOD Handstand shows potential for a new sound for Cyrus and with it new listeners but the question is if Cyrus wants it PERIOD
