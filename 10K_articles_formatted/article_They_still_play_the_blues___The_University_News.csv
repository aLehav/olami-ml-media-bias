3653,2018-10-10,"in  singersongwriter Steve Goodman sick with cancer knew
his time was short PERIOD With his remaining good humor for a denouement
of a disappointing lifetime of following the Chicago Cubs Goodman
composed the enduring anthem to loserdomA Dying Cubs Fans Last
Request. you Chicagoans all know the tune Im sure

Do they still play the blues in Chicago when baseball season
rolls around

When the snow melts away do the Cubbies play in their
ivycovered burial ground

Its played every April up in the Windy City PERIOD And its perfect
for the Cubs the song is not so much a plea for them to change
their losing ways but more a lamented testimonial of joy and
heartbreak an ode to playful miseryif such a thing exists PERIOD

Just one year after this Cubbie hymn first aired in a horribly
bitter twist of fate Goodman died on September  1984four days
before the Cubs won its first ever division title marking their
first postseason appearance since  PERIOD But of course they didnt
win the Series PERIOD

Aside from Goodmans woes so much fret fatigue and ink has
split over this idea of a curse and the pain of being a fan of the
NorthSiders PERIOD All of the premier cruse theorists and witchcraft
pros know about the billy goat and the  Series damning the Cubs
to eternity of miserable failure PERIOD But real baseball fans think
better of itespecially in the current era of Billy Beanesean
statistical philosophy weve all grown past superstition PERIOD Havent
we

Why then logically do the Cubs keep losing The fact is most
of the time they just arent that good PERIOD In the era of their worst
failures the 60s some enduring players like Ernie Banks or Ron
Santo graced Wrigley Field though permeating through their legends
was pitcher Dick Ellsworths  record in the  campaign that
left the Cubs with a  mark PERIOD They finished with the same
depressing record just four years later highlighted by the
categorically inept performances of Byron Browne who struck out
 times in  at bats and another season with 20plus losses
for Ellsworth PERIOD No premonition of a curse there thats simply bad
baseball PERIOD

But this season the unbelievable comes to fruitionthe Cubs
are any way you spin it a solid team PERIOD Now theres Mark Prior
Sammy Sosa and Derek Lee to wash away the sins of Browne Ellsworth
and Keith Moreland PERIOD And after last years turnaround nearly making
it to the World Series they carry and this is a big anomaly
expectations PERIOD

Among others Sports Illustrated selected the Cubs to win the
Series PERIOD Take a moment to let that sink in PERIOD It may be a considered
first but for those dealing in the curse businessbeing on the SI
cover has a bit of a stigma associated with it as well PERIOD It wont be
easy bad mojo everywhere PERIOD

Listen to A Dying Cubs Fans Last Request before the season
heats up PERIOD Behind the whimsically morbid irony is a certain
gratification with Chicagos lack of success PERIOD All of their fans
truly understand the selfdeprecating humor of rootrootrooting
for the Cubbies PERIOD Its like being stuck in a cross between a Woody
AllenBen Stiller movie with Cardinals fans laughing it up in the
audience PERIOD But everyone enjoys the act PERIOD

So Cubs fans ask yourself thisdo you really want this
success baseballs prognosticators are lying upon your team How
will you deal with it What would happen to the annual reassurance
Maybe next year

If this year is next year then next year is goneno more
maybe PERIOD All of the things you have built the love of your team upon
will be lostno more loveable losers PERIOD

Do you really want that ring Ask Frodo it can be rough PERIOD

But for now Goodman sings To the land of the free the home
of the brave and the doormat of the National League. your donation will support the student journalists of Saint Louis University PERIOD Your contribution will help us cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
