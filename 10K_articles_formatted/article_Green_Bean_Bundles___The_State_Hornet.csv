Green Bean Bundles

By Benjamin Dewey

My mother makes an amazing dish during the holidays she calls it green bean bundles PERIOD Originally they were a small handful of green beans wrapped in bacon and then drizzled with a reduced brown sugar sauce PERIOD

These days although still referred to as green bean bundles the bundles are no more PERIOD In the spirit of saving time the green beans are now spread out over a big cookie sheet layered with bits of bacon and then topped with the brown sugar sweetness PERIOD

This side is a must when visiting home for the holidays and often becomes my main course PERIOD

Who needs turkey when there are green bean bundles on the table
