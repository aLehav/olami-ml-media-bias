6219,2023-10-08,"while the Grove Caffe remains a treasured part of campus history its recent encounters with financial problems have persisted in conjunction with unstable management  two unresolved and increasingly pressing issues that plague UCSDs first coffee shop PERIOD

The future of the Grove seemed tentatively positive at the end of last year PERIOD As the A.S PERIOD Council and Grove staff members worked to forge a partnership with graduate students of the UCSD Rady School of Management it appeared that the Grove had found a compromise that would preserve it as a studentrun enterprise PERIOD

However any prospective ties with the Rady School have now been severed and the A.S PERIOD Council has instead elected to appoint an external manager to regain control of the shops weakened finances hoping that doing so will ensure a muchneeded stability for the struggling A.S PERIOD enterprise PERIOD

Originally we thought that a partnership with the school could be formed Associate Vice President of Enterprise Operations Chelsea Maxwell said in an email PERIOD However after several conversations between the A.S. Grove employees and the Rady School of Management it became clear that the Grove would need more stable and permanent management if it were to survive. the decision to hire an outside manager does nothing to alleviate the Groves climbing debt  a problem exacerbated Spring Quarter of last year when original owner Ron Carlson liquidated his 50percent ownership of the coffee shops contract leaving the A.S PERIOD enterprise with a staggering  debt PERIOD

Now Grove employees are skeptical of the councils agreement to hire a fulltime manager an option considerably more expensive than the former managerial system of hiring UCSD students PERIOD

A.S PERIOD will bear the burden of financially supporting this individual as the Grove is an A.S PERIOD enterprise John Muir College alumnus and former Grove employee Jason Grishkoff said in an email PERIOD In addition to the debt already incurred A.S PERIOD has to foot relocation costs and a fulltime salary for this individual PERIOD We had a completely free resource at our disposal with our relationship with the Rady School. regardless of the skepticism the council remains adamant about implementing a new method of management and has been thorough in selecting a manager that it hopes will uphold the socially conscious ideals the Grove strives toward PERIOD

Over the summer a search committee was formed interviews were held and a fulltime manager was chosen for the Grove Maxwell said PERIOD

Although students will no longer have the same access to handson practice in smallbusiness management Grove employees are largely optimistic about the strength of the shops staying power PERIOD

Im sure the new manager is a fully competent individual so I can only hope that she keeps the vibes of the Grove alive serving socially and environmentally conscious products and establishing the atmosphere that makes the Grove what its so loved for Grishkoff said PERIOD

But the disappointment surrounding failed relations with the Rady School of Management is palpable when broached to Grove employees PERIOD

We met several times with A.S PERIOD and discussed very seriously about the potential partnership with Rady Grishkoff said PERIOD Rady never rejected the idea PERIOD They received us very positively and working together we came up with a lot of good ideas PERIOD It was an A.S PERIOD decision to terminate the relationship. your donation will support the student journalists at University of California San Diego PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment keep printing our papers and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
