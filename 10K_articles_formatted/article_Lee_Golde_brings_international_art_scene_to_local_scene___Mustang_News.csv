Imagine a world slightly different from this one PERIOD In this world youre foolish  and youve agreed to a blind date with someone named Lee Golde PERIOD But because youve fallen behind on social media obligations you have no idea what this person looks like PERIOD

It could be a woman or a Jewish or Asian man Leonard Bessemer says sorting through the possibilities PERIOD

Really none of them is right PERIOD

Lee Golde is the androgynous namesake of Bessemers contemporary art gallery which opened in downtown San Luis Obispo this past October PERIOD

When a space became available Bessemer took the opportunity to pursue a thought hed held for some time bringing art from the international scene and large cultural hubs like Los Angeles or New York City to the much smaller scope of San Luis Obispo PERIOD

He just needed a good name PERIOD

Id always on the back burner thought itd be great to have a gallery space here Bessemer said PERIOD It was cheap enough that I could afford it I didnt need a huge revenue. thus Lee Golde was born PERIOD

Bessemer plans to use the space to feature contemporary art and live music PERIOD For now he specifically wants to focus on the 21stcentury networkconscious postInternet art style along with female artists PERIOD

Largely its going to be mixed media and installations he said PERIOD In terms of the type of art theres a new term postinternet art PERIOD A focus on female artists would be part of my goal. that said Bessemer has chosen to keep Lee Goldes final shape and form like its name rather ambiguous  not necessarily a bad thing PERIOD He prefers to let his project grow through avenues organically rather than getting stuck on a particular ambition PERIOD

Its still in the process he said PERIOD Itll become more defined as time goes on PERIOD I have an idea of what I want but Im not gonna pigeonhole or force it there. an idea might not sound like a particularly airtight business plan but according to Bessemer the aim is education before profit PERIOD He sees San Luis Obispo as a safe haven from the vicious competition of more metropolitan scenes  revenue doesnt have to take the forefront PERIOD

I could go to Los Angeles and join the galleries and the masses he said PERIOD But then youre just trying to grab a piece of the market rather than creating the market. the market Bessemer is trying to build will seek to appeal to young adults with permanent residence in San Luis Obispo PERIOD

The goal is creating something outside of downtown for people  to  that are actually staying in San Luis Obispo and not moving away he said PERIOD Theres absolutely nothing else for people to seek shows or play shows outside of the direct downtown area PERIOD I think a lot of people that live here are tired of that PERIOD Its homogenous PERIOD The bars are all owned by the same person. music is a major aspect of Lee Golde but Bessemer wants to maintain the gallery status of his space PERIOD In the end even with his utilitarian dogma selling some art certainly isnt something Bessemer is opposed to PERIOD

Currently an exhibit by artist Jacqueline Norheim is being featured until Jan PERIOD  PERIOD The centerpiece of her exhibit is a large cloth entitled Cloth Altar along with an 18hour time lapse of the tarp in a landscape PERIOD

Its kind of homage to the space and that spot where I installed it  kind of a steady always playing with foreground and background and figure ground she said PERIOD Im always just trying to create magical slightly confusing visual experiences. norheim spoke highly of her experience working with Bessemer at Lee Golde PERIOD

Well I think the exhibit itself came out really well she said PERIOD Leonard is running what looks like a very contemporary professional gallery PERIOD I think his presentation is amazing PERIOD He was really helpful as a curator in terms of how to create the show and put the space together. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
