9449,1970-01-01,"senior guard Freddie Wilson dribbles down the floor Feb PERIOD  PERIOD Ken Chaney  The TriangleWhat are you going to do

At some point the words start to stick PERIOD At some point the criticism of offensive schemes begins to erode and logic starts to take hold PERIOD

What are you going to do

James Bruiser Flint the head coach of the Drexel University mens basketball team must have uttered that phrase four dozen times throughout the course of the seasons press conferences PERIOD

In November he used it as a crutch when his team missed open shots and couldnt halt a highflying Iona College team PERIOD After the Dragons  loss to the University of Delaware Feb PERIOD  he asked it because there was nothing left to ask PERIOD

The team announced Feb PERIOD  that junior guard Damion Lee the Colonial Athletic Associations leading scorer and Drexels sole offensive catalyst would miss the rest of the season with a broken hand PERIOD The junior sharpshooter suffered the injury in the teams loss to Northeastern University the day before PERIOD Lee played the majority of the game with the injury finishing with  points PERIOD

On Feb PERIOD  the day before the teams loss to Delaware freshman guard Sammy Mojica Jr PERIOD slipped on a wet spot during practice and sprained his knee PERIOD He too is done for the season PERIOD

Lee and Mojica became the fourth and fifth Dragons respectively to have their seasons cut abruptly short by injury PERIOD

So when the Dragons couldnt muster more than  points on senior night when his team couldnt stop Delaware from shooting . percent in the first half when his team missed  shots Flint couldnt ask anything else PERIOD What was he going to do He had seven players and this time he didnt have his best one to save the rest PERIOD

Its just been one of those years a dejected Flint said after the loss slouched in his blue feltbacked chair in the Daskalakis Athletic Center for the final time this season PERIOD Guys got tired PERIOD Weve got no guard subs PERIOD A couple of my big guys got in foul trouble PERIOD

I just wanted us to keep fighting is all PERIOD Thats all you can ask from them PERIOD It is what it is with this thing he said PERIOD

This thing is a slew of injuries that started in April when senior forward Kazembe Abif tore his anterior cruciate ligament PERIOD Hes missed the entire season PERIOD

This thing continued in late October when sophomore guard Major Canady dislocated his ankle in practice PERIOD Out for the year as well PERIOD

Seven different players have suffered major injuries either ending their season or missing upwards of a month of playing time PERIOD

This year has been absolutely positively ridiculous Flint said PERIOD The toughest thing about these injuries especially this year is youve got to try and do something different. against Delaware that different thing was playing senior guard Freddie Wilson for  minutes PERIOD Wilson scored  firsthalf points leading the team by example and knocking down big shots on senior night adrenaline PERIOD But in the second half Wilson said he was just plain tired PERIOD That wasnt ever the plan with Wilson and as Flint explained when you throw players into situations theyre unprepared for youre just begging for miscues PERIOD

Youre putting people in positions theyre not necessarily used to being in Flint explained PERIOD Thats the big thing about having injuries  youre asking guys to do things that some of them arent ready to do it and some of them just cant. the loss was the Dragons fourth in a row after winning six straight and dropped them into the seventh spot in the CAA standings PERIOD Unless Drexel tops The College of William  Mary in the final game of the season Feb PERIOD  and Delaware loses to Towson University on the same day Drexel will be the No PERIOD  seed in the CAA Tournament starting Mar PERIOD  in Baltimore Maryland PERIOD

With one regular season game to play and likely not an abundance of action in the postseason Flint said hes just trying to keep his remaining seven players focused on preparing for whatever comes at them PERIOD

Well come to practice talk about different scenarios just in case we lose our guards do the types of stuff like that Flint detailed PERIOD Weve got seven players so we cant scrimmage PERIOD Were just walking through stuff like that PERIOD Thats it really. because really what are you going to do",Injury-ravaged m. bball falls to Delaware - The Triangle,Drexel University
