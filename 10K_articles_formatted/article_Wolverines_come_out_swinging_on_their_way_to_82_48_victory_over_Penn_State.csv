One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom





After two straight losses to ranked teams Michigan came out guns blazing on Tuesday afternoon PERIOD With quick inside points and a defense that confounded Penn State nothing was going to stop its enthusiasm PERIOD



The mistakes that plagued the Wolverines the last two games disappeared on their way to an  victory over the Nittany Lions  overall  Big Ten where Michigan   looked unstoppable for long stretches PERIOD



The Wolverines made a point early on to feed the beast on the inside sophomore forward Naz Hillmon PERIOD After quiet starts to both the prior games she scored eight points in the first quarter taking advantage of mismatches inside PERIOD



Any time you have a player like Naz on your team you want to make sure she gets some early touches because she draws so much attention to herself said Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico PERIOD So I thought we did a great job of that and I thought we were able to get some shots to fall during the course of the game. senior forward Kayla Robbins continued to showcase impressive effort on both sides of the ball getting on the court and fighting for every ball PERIOD She also found the lane driving to the basket and cutting through the Nittany Lions on her way to another solid game scoring  and coming down with seven rebounds PERIOD



In the first quarter Robbins scored the first 3pointer of the game for Michigan  adding a muchneeded dimension to its offense that was missing in its last few games PERIOD



We had been struggling lately and we knew we had some great shooters in Hailey Brown and Michelle Sidor and Danielle Rauch and Emily Kiser Barnes Arico said PERIOD I mean we had some really good shooters that were struggling so that was really just keep getting your shots up in practice get your confidence going and our shots will fall. a big part of the Wolverines 3point shooting throughout the season has been junior forward Brown whose cold drought from beyond the arc ended in the second quarter when she nailed two in quick succession on her way to eight points in the quarter PERIOD



Her hot streak continued through the second half on her way to a teamleading  points



Thats what she does said sophomore guard Amy Dilk PERIOD Thats a big part of her game PERIOD Its a big boost for us its a big plus for us to have a four being able to knock down threes like that PERIOD Im super happy for her to finally be back in her rhythm so it was great to see Brown knock down some shots. while Michigans offense was having its way with Penn State the defense smothered it on nearly every possession PERIOD



Pushing the Nittany Lions deep into the shot clock for all of their possessions the Wolverines forced them to run in circles to try and find space which they ultimately couldnt PERIOD They shot  percent from the field and most of their shots that fell were contested PERIOD Michigan also forced  turnovers scoring  points in the stolen possessions PERIOD



Robbins who was a big part of the oppressive defense drew three offensive fouls in the first half alone including a massive charge in the midst of one of the Wolverines runs  prompting the officials to cite the team with a delay of game warning after every member of the team on the bench jumped out on the court on the way to a media timeout PERIOD



We always strive to make enthusiastic plays and have our bench be enthusiastic Dilk said PERIOD It gets the fans engaged PERIOD We feed off each others energy so starting off a game like that thats a big part of our team to start a game like that and have each others backs and congratulating them. the outburst came from a team that finally worked through the frustrations it experienced in the prior games PERIOD A team that got its mojo back that enjoyed itself PERIOD
