9048,2023-11-04,"go students received an allcampus email recruiting them to join the Alcohol Review Committee a team of faculty staff and students gathered together to discuss alcohol use on campus PERIOD

Associate Dean of Students Cathy Carlson the board leader is working to increase awareness of the colleges alcohol policies PERIOD

The alcohol review committee has existed at Carleton for the past  years to explore the alcohol climate on campus and make recommendations to the College about how to make Carleton a safer place based on alcohol use Carlson said PERIOD

The board was formed primarily to protect student safety but also to review the colleges compliance with federal laws such as the Drug Free Schools and Communities Act PERIOD

According to Carlson the college is required to review these policies every two years PERIOD

The committee is not a policy changing group but we put recommendations forth based on the students Carlson said. she added that the board makes these recommendations to the College Council and president based on discussion comparing Carletons policies with other schools policies PERIOD

Recently the boards recommendations have led the college to place tighter restrictions on kegs and to enforce a ban on drinking games which Carlson said was put into policy ten years ago but never showed up in the books. the next topics of discussion will be campus events such as Sayles dances and spring events PERIOD
Safety to students is number one said Carlson but we also need to comply with laws. the committee is made up of staff one faculty member and usually five to eight students PERIOD Currently the board has only three student members Evan Liebowitz  Emma Brobeck  and Eric Leppink  PERIOD

Brobeck joined the committee largely because I was unhappy about the alcohol culture and also because I wanted to understand what was going on administratively as well as from other students perspectives she said PERIOD

Liebowitz expressed a similar unhappiness with the alcohol culture on campus which he said he gained from his experience as an RA PERIOD

In particular what bothered me the most was seeing freshmen on my floor who hadnt drank at all in high school suddenly start to binge drink once they hit college often because it seemed like it was expected of them as college freshmen to drink he said PERIOD

Both Brobeck and Liebowitz also expressed a desire to rid the campus alcohol culture of stigmas and stereotypes surrounding the choice of drinking PERIOD

When I joined I mainly had a desire to bridge a gap between the students who are subfree and those who are not Brobeck said PERIOD I had lived on a subfree floor for two years and I was unhappy that the term carried a negative connotation for some students while those who lived on the subfree floors could easily end up isolating themselves from other sections of the campus. evan expressed a similar desire to rid the campus of stereotypes like you have to be drunk to enjoy a Sayles dance as well as beliefs that subfree kids are boring and nonsubfree kids are always drunk. he also added his desire to deemphasize alcohol as a part of student life. carlson hopes to add several new student members to the committee to create a group of students diverse in their experiences with alcohol PERIOD

Sometimes I think we can get stuck in a segment of the student population and we have trouble seeing across the borders but when we are able to discuss across years and viewpoints it helps us develop our own Brobeck said adding I want to see a safe and healthy community PERIOD I dont care whether students choose to drink or not but I want to at least know that they are able to keep themselves and others safe. your donation will support the student journalists of Carleton College PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
