With the weather this week reaching highs in the upper 50s those warm temperatures will take a dip while students are away on spring break PERIOD



Cold weather said local weather observer Dalias Price will return with temperatures reaching below freezing as students return to Charleston PERIOD

Its nothing like when we had our three above on March  Price commented PERIOD

However temperatures will return the following week to the 50s PERIOD Despite the springtime weather Price emphasizes that it is still really late winter PERIOD

A lot of people think spring begins on March  but thats an astronomical amount he said PERIOD

Longer days will be here soon but students will still have to put up with a range of highs and lows PERIOD One possible threat to the area as springtime approaches is the possibility thunderstorms and tornadoes caused by the warm air masses from the south combining to meet the cooler air masses from the Rocky Mountains PERIOD

There ought to be some kites flying in this weather Price commented PERIOD

Many spring breakers will be traveling to Florida PERIOD The weather forecast for the next few days in the panhandle calls for highs near the mid 70s with mostly sunny skies PERIOD Winds will be southernly between  to  m.p.h. with lows in the upper 40s www.weather.com reported PERIOD

Students traveling to the southern region of Florida should expect rain PERIOD The weather channel Web site said highs will be around the upper 70s and lower 80s with winds in the upper 60s PERIOD Winds will be between  to  m.p.h. with occasional showers expected the next few days with thunderstorms later in the week PERIOD

Peaks for high traffic congestion are between  to  a.m PERIOD and  p.m PERIOD and after said construction engineer for Illinois Department of Transportation Scott Corneilus PERIOD He recommends students should avoid driving at these times PERIOD

From Humboldt to Tuscola on Interstate  there will be bridge work being done reducing driving to one lane PERIOD Corneilus said students should reduce speed in that area PERIOD

Corneilus says he doesnt expect a lot of traffic for spring breakers PERIOD

Ive never keyed in on additional traffic PERIOD It must not be that significant he noted PERIOD

However warm weather usually brings out more drivers Corneilus said PERIOD

When you get closer to the university youll see more traffic he said PERIOD

The only delays for students returning to Eastern would be on Interstate  PERIOD Interstate  is a mess Corneilus said PERIOD

The construction will be taking place one mile west of Illinois Route  to the Indiana State line PERIOD Eastbound lanes where most of the work is scheduled will be closed PERIOD Westbound lanes will be reduced to one lane to allow eastbound motorists to travel in one of the westbound lanes creating headtohead traffic PERIOD A concrete barrier will divide the westbound lanes PERIOD Motorists should slow down and allow for a five to  minute delay PERIOD

For local road conditions students can call  or  PERIOD

If you want to spend spring break at home it wont be too bad Price said PERIOD
