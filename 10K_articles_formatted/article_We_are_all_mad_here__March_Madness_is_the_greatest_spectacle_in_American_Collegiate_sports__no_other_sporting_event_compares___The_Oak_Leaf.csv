Matt Rubel Assistant Sports EditorApril  

The month of March has a tendency to fly under peoples radar but March is also known for its madness and it lived up to the bill once again this year PERIOD

The NCAA college basketball tournament every March is the best sporting event on the planet PERIOD It has something for everybody PERIOD

First if youre a drama seeker look no further than the KentuckyNotre Dame game PERIOD The supposed best team in the tourney Kentucky came back to win in overtime over the Irish a game that contained more drama than an episode of Law and Order. second if you enjoy an underdog story the No PERIOD  seed UCLA made the Sweet Sixteen and maybe even more impressively the No PERIOD  seed Michigan State Spartans were in the Final Four PERIOD With hopes of wearing the glass slipper the Spartans are a true Cinderella story PERIOD

This years tournament has provided more twists than an M PERIOD Night Shyamalan film like No PERIOD  seed Georgia State upsetting the No PERIOD  seed Baylor Bears PERIOD Another No PERIOD  seed beat a No PERIOD  seed when University of Alabama Birmingham upset the Iowa State Cyclones in the first round PERIOD

Third if youre just an oldfashioned sports fan there is no better feeling than watching a game where a team has to win or go home where survive and advance are all that matter PERIOD

This makes filling out your bracket exciting PERIOD Theres a reason there is a million dollar prize for a perfect bracket its nearly impossible to achieve PERIOD You are more likely to win the lottery then perfectly pick  college basketball games correctly PERIOD For all these reasons the tournament provides excitement no other sport can provide PERIOD

Some will ask what about the World Cup Isnt that the most popular sporting event on the planet

Any time there are countries going at it like at the World Cup there is a patriotic element that brings a new crop of fans every four years PERIOD

However there lies the problem PERIOD Anything considered the best sporting event has to be every year PERIOD Otherwise it becomes a novelty that is not up to caliber with annual events PERIOD Would you prefer to wait a year or four years

The answer is pretty simple PERIOD

The only other thing that can even compare with March Madness is the College Football Playoffs or the NFL playoffs but they share the same flaw PERIOD
Its the best of the best competing and no chance for a sleeper to upset its human nature to want to see David beat Goliath but that cant happen if there is no David PERIOD

This years Final Four showcased Kentucky Wisconsin Michigan State and Duke in a fourteam battle royale PERIOD

The teams playing Goliath are Kentucky a storied program in Duke PERIOD Top seeded Wisconsin and the feisty Michigan State Spartans team will play the role of David PERIOD

There is no doubt the NCAA March Madness has already once again defended its title as the best sporting event of the year PERIOD

Although the David versus Goliath matchup didnt come to fruition as Kentucky and Michigan State both lost Saturday night the Championship will still be a great game PERIOD
Duke squares off against Wisconsin two No PERIOD  seeds the NCAA player of the year Frank The Tank Kaminsky and the winningest coach in Division I history Mike Krzyzewski PERIOD

Though Wisconsin knocked off the  Wildcats they still are running into a juggernaut in the Duke Blue Devils PERIOD

A big dose of Jahlil Okafor in the end will prove too much for the Badgers and Kaminsky in Indianapolis in the final game PERIOD
