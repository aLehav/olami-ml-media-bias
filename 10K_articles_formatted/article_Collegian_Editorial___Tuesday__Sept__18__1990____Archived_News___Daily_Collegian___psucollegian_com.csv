Bill will help women in government

Women encounter discrimination daily perhaps because they do not hold the positions necessary to make a difference PERIOD

State Rep PERIOD Ruth Rudy DCentre last year proposed a genderbalance bill to ensure that women hold half the appointed positions on state boards and commissions PERIOD

Passage of Rudys bill which will be discussed in the House next week would ensure that women contribute to state government in significant numbers PERIOD Representatives would be wise to pass the bill PERIOD

As of last year according to Rudys figures women held only about  of  appointed positions on Pennsylvania boards and commissions PERIOD

Although women have made strides in employment the  network rather than merit still often determines who gets jobs and who doesnt PERIOD

Those who argue that quota systems allow unqualified individuals to fill important posts assume a dearth of qualified women in the job market PERIOD However that is not the case PERIOD

Though the bill would not apply to local government the presence of women in state government might make municipal appointments for women more likely PERIOD And passing the bill has the surefire advantage of giving women a stronger voice in state government meaning state commissions and boards will be more wary of latent biases in their decisions PERIOD

As women face discrimination in the work force daily passage of this bill will give them an equal chance at jobs that will make a difference in the future PERIOD
