Georgetown professor and former Republican Nebraska Senator ChuckHagelhas been nominated as President Barack Obamas next Secretary of Defense PERIOD

Obama made the announcement Monday morning along with his choice for John Brennan as the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency PERIOD

WhileHagelhas accepted the nomination he must still be confirmed by the Senate PERIOD

The nomination has attracted a firestorm of accusations thatHagel a Vietnam veteran with two purple hearts is antiIsraelantigayand complacent toward Iran according to The Washington Post PERIOD The Post reported that Obamas announcement prompted the formation of several support and opposition groups seeking to influence the senatorial vote including one financed by the Emergency Committee for Israel PERIOD

The Hoya previously reported that in a Sept PERIOD   address in Riggs LibraryHagelurged America to engage and seek common interests with the Middle East heralding the coming presidency as a pivotal moment in U.S.Middle East relations PERIOD

We cant squander the next four years he is reported to have said PERIOD The next president will have to make Congress the Senate and the world a partner. hagel who according to The New York Times supported the American war in Afghanistan but quickly withdrew initial support for the Iraq War also said in the  address at Georgetown that traditional methods of force are not appropriate for conflicts in the Middle East PERIOD

The Middle East is a tribal land it has a history it is complicated he said PERIOD Military strength is not the solution in the Middle East. amid uncertainty aboutHagelsterm as potential Secretary of Defense Michael Bailey chair of the government department said he foresees continuity with current Secretary of Defense LeonPanettaspolicy PERIOD

I think it means four more years of the same approach centrist  and sometimes conservative  foreign policy with more liberal people at least being in the room Bailey wrote in an email PERIOD

Hagelwas due to teach an international affairs course titled21stCentury Geopolitical Realities next semester but the class has beencancelledin the wake of his nomination according to enrolled student TaylorWettachSFS13 PERIOD

Wettach who expressed disappointment at the coursescancellation said he signed up because he wanted to learn from someone who had been at the forefront of important foreign policy decisions in recent years PERIOD

For me perception was that ChuckHagelwas a good cross in terms of being on the policy side and making the big decisions in the political arenaWettachsaid PERIOD He would have been great to learn from. wettach who added thatHagelsolicited biographies from the class to gauge student interests said that communication about the status of the course could have been clearer but he understood the decision to cancel it PERIOD

It would have been nice to have a little more information and more knowledge but given the situation the university did the best it could he said PERIOD If I had been asked to be Secretary of Defense I would havecancelledmy class too. carol Lancaster Dean of the Walsh School of Foreign Service said she regretted Hagels departure from Georgetowns faculty but wished him well in office as Secretary of Defense if confirmed PERIOD

He is a man of integrity experienced in defense and security issues a true patriot and an impressive leader PERIOD I shall be sad to see him leave Georgetown  he has been a successful engaging professor and a very good citizen participatingin many extracurricular activities at Georgetown during his time with us she wrote in an email PERIOD I look forward to his service as a successful Secretary of Defense. in addition to his undergraduate geopolitics courseHagelpreviously taught a graduate course titled Redefining Geopolitical Relationships in which he was known for creative teaching methods PERIOD

A Nov PERIOD   article in The Hoya reported thatHagelrewarded the three students who most accurately predicted the outcomes of the election of that month with bottles of Federalist Zinfandel Wine PERIOD In addition remembering students request that he arrange a class visit from President Obama he treated the class to a surprise appearance by his former staffer T PERIOD J PERIOD Birkel donning an Obama mask PERIOD

At a time when the world is so tense so much trouble I think its kind of fun to lighten it up a bit and remind us all we are humansHagelsaid at the time PERIOD
