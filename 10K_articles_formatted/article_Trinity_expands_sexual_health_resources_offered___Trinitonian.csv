With Valentines Day right around the corner its a good time to know where to find different sexual health tools PERIOD The Health and Wellness Center HWC at Trinity offers many sexual health resources for Trinity students the amount of which continues to grow with partnerships and the possible implementation of health and wellness vending machines. the HWC is devoted to providing adequate sexual healthcare to students PERIOD They strive to constantly improve upon their services and interact with other universities to do so according to John Meyer family nurse practitioner with HWC PERIOD

Trinity University Health Services is a participating member of the American College Health Association and we do learn from other universities sexual health services Meyer said PERIOD

Alongside influences from the American College Health Association students opinions and needs help determine what the HWC provides PERIOD Marcy Youngdahl director of integrated counseling and health services and physician at the health center explains that this process occurs through surveys PERIOD

Remaining up to date with the needs of our campus means that we will always seek to refine our services PERIOD We are conducting the National College Health Assessment Survey this March which will survey all students regarding their general and sexual wellness  needs Youngdahl said PERIOD

The HWC is taking other steps to expand like the upcoming Sex Week from Feb PERIOD  which includes a variety of different activities PERIOD

Sexual health education is so important but  can often feel awkward and taboo so we will be hosting a variety of events which we hope will be informative and fun Youngdahl said PERIOD

Sex Week will also include one of HWCs new partnerships the San Antonio AIDS Foundation SAAF PERIOD On Feb PERIOD  SAAF will begin the first of many visits to campus PERIOD

The SAAF mobile testing unit will come to campus to offer free HIV syphilis chlamydia and gonorrhea testing to students Youngdahl said PERIOD We are aiming to have them on campus twice per month for the duration of the semester. this isnt the first time HWC has partnered with an outside company either PERIOD Bettys Co. a mobile gynecology clinic has been working with HWC since December PERIOD

We felt the need to improve access to all forms of contraception on campus Youngdahl said PERIOD We are very happy to be able to offer students easy access to longacting reversible contraception including Nexplanon Implanon and IUDs. there is another expansion to HWC services in the process the health and wellness vending machines PERIOD These vending machines are set to include resources like rapid COVID tests bandages overthecounter medication and sexual health tools like condoms dental dams and Plan B pills PERIOD These vending machines prioritize availability and comfort Meg McDonald senior ancient Greek and ancient Mediterranean studies double major and the president of the prochoice club explained PERIOD

These health and wellness items  would be more confidential and available outside of normal business hours McDonald said PERIOD

However the vending machines arent set in stone PERIOD There are possible issues with the vending machines as Youngdahl warns but now all we can do is wait PERIOD

There are many logistical issues that still need to be addressed but we have now gathered enough information for the executive leadership team to review and determine whether this is a safe and sustainable project for the campus Youngdahl said PERIOD

HWCs existing services fall into two major categories preventative services and problemfocused services PERIOD The preventative services offered by the HWC include the human papillomavirus HPV vaccine pap smears sexually transmitted infection STI screening contraceptive counseling in which they offer they offer prescriptions for the pill the patch Nuvaring DepoProvera and human immunovirus HIV care PERIOD

On the problemfocused side physicians offer assessments and treatments for different issues including STIs PERIOD

However students have to look outside the HWC for some services PERIOD In the case of a student in need of a birth control implant or intrauterine device IUD for example the physicians at the health center will refer them to outside specialists PERIOD The reason for outsourcing these services Meyer explains is for the benefit of the student PERIOD

I want students that need these services to get the best quality care available therefore I would refer my patients to a clinic that provides this special care all the time and is good at it Meyer said PERIOD

The need for sexual health resources in colleges is relevant as collegeaged students have the highest risk of STIs and half of the population contracts researchers at the University of Iowa PERIOD Students can utilize the resources that Trinity has in place currently while waiting for the privacy of the vending machines PERIOD
If students feel more comfortable initially talking to a peer McDonald encourages students to come to Trinitys prochoice club with sexual health issues PERIOD

TU prochoices role is to share sexual health information and make sure that we can inform people of the things they have access to  helping with any sort of questions about whether or not the resources on campus are available and when McDonald said PERIOD TU prochoice is always a welcome call PERIOD  Were happy to point you in the right direction. reaching out for sexual health reasons can be intimidating but Youngdahl reassures students that theres no reason to worry about going to health services PERIOD

We are a lowcost and confidential clinic PERIOD We adhere to strict medical privacy standards PERIOD Our staff are all declared confidential resources under Title IX PERIOD We recognize that this is often the first time that students are utilizing medical care without parental support and we recognize that its really uncomfortable for most people to talk about their sexual health Youngdahl said PERIOD

The services offered at Trinity are in place for students to use and Meyer echoes Youngdahls sentiment about being welcome to ask for help PERIOD

We deal with these problems all the time and are accustomed to speaking with our patients in plain language about sex Meyer said PERIOD Please come see me if you have a weird drainage coming out of your penis PERIOD I can help. hi My name is Samara Gerstle sheher and Im the news section editor for the Trinitonian this year Im a sophomore and this is my second year..
