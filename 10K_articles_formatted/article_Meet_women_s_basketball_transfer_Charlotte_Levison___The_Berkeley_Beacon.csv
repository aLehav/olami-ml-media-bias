Levison who plays Guard and Forward is a DI transfer from the University of Denver PERIOD

By Jordan Pagkalinawan Sports Editor December  

Junior guard Charlotte Levison transferred to Emerson from the University of Denveran NCAA Division  programthis year joining two firstyear players as the newest Lions on the womens basketball team this year PERIOD

Entering the transfer portal last October Levison began talking to coach Bill Gould in November and committed to Emerson on the June  deadline after reviewing film from last seasons team PERIOD

I just wanted more of a balance with my life school and basketball Levison said PERIOD I wanted to have fun and get to play so that was a big factor  And for basketball Emerson is on the uphill so I wanted to be a part of it she said PERIOD

Levison said the transition has been easy playing pickup games with her teammates and getting acclimated with her coaches PERIOD She noted team bonding happens on and off the court PERIOD

We all hung out on Halloween she said PERIOD Everyone was dressed up and hanging out PERIOD Basketball was nowhere near our minds PERIOD It was pretty nice. traveling across the country to Boston Levison is one of three players from California PERIOD She said the city environment piqued her interest in the Lions PERIOD

Everything is happening in Boston which is really nice she said. theres something to do PERIOD If you want to get some good food its right next door PERIOD Its perfect. unfortunately for Levison and the team the junior guard tore her ACL on Oct PERIOD  taking her out of play for the rest of the season PERIOD Despite her injury Levinson hopes to be a positive presence from the bench PERIOD

I point out things I see that they may not on the court and next year hopefully I can be that leader again she said PERIOD

Just as she will be a vocal leader on the bench Levison says that shes vocal on the court among her other strengths such a powerful defensive force PERIOD She also noted her shooting consistency as an area of growth PERIOD

Firstyear guard Lena Hicks says Levison prides herself on being the loudest person on the court and Hicks often looks to the junior for guidance since her first day of practice PERIOD

I was apprehensive about meeting everyone on the team and we really clicked Hicks said. i feel like I can relate on some stuff with Levison. feeling like I have someone who will be in my corner is important to me. one of Levisons core leadership traits is encouraging her teammates and communicating constantly PERIOD

I was taking a baseline drive my head was down I was just not seeing the court and I heard her yell LENA and I looked up ended up passing the ball and making the play Hicks said. shes always in communication and still a part of the team  and makes her presence felt. levison advises firstyear players that basketball comes and goes telling them not to stress over everything PERIOD

Everyone makes mistakes she said PERIOD Youre going to get yelled at things are going to happen but just move on. levison said one of her personal goals is to be the best teammate she can be on the court no matter what role it is PERIOD Since her ACL tear shes taken on a mentor role PERIOD Hicks said Levison has given valuable advice to the firstyear players especially controlling what they can control PERIOD

Whether its her energy and communication on the bench or her presence as a teammate and leader Levison has already made an impact on the team in her first few months and that will certainly be felt once again once shes back on the court PERIOD
