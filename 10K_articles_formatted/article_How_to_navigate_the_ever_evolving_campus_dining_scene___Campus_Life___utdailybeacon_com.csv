Given how huge UTs campus is finding something to eat is rather easy PERIOD However figuring out how to utilize a dining plan in the best way possible can be a little more challenging PERIOD

UT offers many different meal plans which can be found on the Vol Dining website PERIOD

While freshmen living on campus are a bit limited in their options  they must choose either the Tennessee Unlimited  or Tennessee Unlimited   commuters and upperclassmen are free to choose whichever dining plan they want PERIOD In the case that commuters and upperclassmen dont choose a meal plan themselves theyre automatically enrolled in the  flex plan PERIOD

Flex dollars and dining dollars operate as taxfree dollars that allow students to purchase items from any of the retail locations and P.O.D PERIOD markets on campus PERIOD Balances can be found on VolCard accounts and on receipts after making a purchase PERIOD

A majority of meal plans include meal swipes to be used at UTs dining halls which include Rocky Top Dining Hall Stokely Dining Hall and Southern Kitchen PERIOD In order to use a meal swipe students must add their student ID to their phones wallet and touch their phone or physical card to the sensors located inside all dining locations PERIOD

Meal swipes can also be used at participating retail locations and P.O.D PERIOD markets on campus which is referred to as meal equivalency PERIOD

The only caveats to meal equivalency are that students have to order within the constraints set by the retail location and that it forbids access to a dining hall during the meal period that it was used PERIOD

For instance students cant go to a Starbucks on campus order whatever they want and ask to use their meal swipe PERIOD Instead they have to order from the posted meal equivalency options that Starbucks advertises PERIOD

Furthermore if a student uses their meal equivalency during the lunch period which runs from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m. then they cannot enter a dining hall again until the dinner period begins PERIOD Specific dining hours can also be found on the Vol Dining website PERIOD

Additionally there are multiple ways to order from UTs dining locations PERIOD Students can go to the location directly and get in line to order with an employee or they can use a kiosk PERIOD Kiosks are posted by participating locations and allow students to skip the line and order ahead with GrubHub PERIOD

Kiosks can be incredibly convenient since theyre compatible with meal swipes and diningflex dollars PERIOD However be aware that it can be difficult to make modifications to meals ordered on a kiosk as they sometimes only offer specific items and there isnt always an option to add or remove things PERIOD

Students can also order food to their location by taking advantage of Starship a robot delivery service that debuted on campus last semester PERIOD Dining and flex dollars can be used with Starship as well as a debit card PERIOD Starship sometimes offers promotions in which deliveries are free during certain times but a small fee is to be expected in most cases PERIOD

Keep in mind that while meal swipes cannot be replaced additional dining and flex dollars can be transferred to a VolCard if a student runs out PERIOD Or if nothing else debit cards can be used at retail locations and P.O.D PERIOD markets too PERIOD

Admittedly dining on UTs campus can be a little tricky to get used to at first but as it is with many new things the more exposure one gets the quicker itll start to feel like second nature PERIOD
