2190,2022-03-16,"most students at UChicago have had to deal with endless inquiries about whether or not we are actually safe all the way on the South Side of Chicago PERIOD Concerned parents are full of questions about how the supposedly outofcontrol violence of the city will affect their children and whether or not campus is removed enough to create a solid barrier PERIOD While the University clearly strives to protect its students after the recent surge in gun violence in  it is becoming more difficult to combat rumors about just how safe Chicago really is PERIOD

The University has already implemented safety measures that are typical at urban universities the blue light system the UCPDs safety escort program and security guards at every corner make navigating the campus itself fairly secure PERIOD I can recall being flooded with information about getting around the city security on the South Side and the resources available to me even during OWeek PERIOD Even then hearing the doubts of family members as we are sent off again after winter break strikes a familiar nerve PERIOD UChicagos safety measures notwithstanding can we truly feel safe on campus

The first thing we need to keep in mind is that the University is constantly taking measures to create a safer environment for students PERIOD After the death of Ph.D PERIOD student Amadou Cisse in  UChicago took immediate action to improve security on campus PERIOD The UCPD doubled its latenight police presence and the University took steps to improve the way it shared emergency information PERIOD It is clear that whenever there is cause to increase precautions no time is wasted some may even feel that the University needs to do more PERIOD However students must consider that these safety measures often come at a price PERIOD A wellfunded expansive private police force sounds reassuring to UChicago students but makes life more difficult for many Hyde Park residents unaffiliated with the University PERIOD This is especially true in a city fraught with allegations of racialized policing and profiling PERIOD

Additionally while attending UChicago it is easy to ignore the rich cultural life that the South Side has to offer and let the stigma of crime overpower the positivity PERIOD Peering through the secluded bubble of our university we only perceive the South Side through a violent lens PERIOD We are quick to go up in arms when there is an increased need for security but there is a tendency to let the events of the South Side fall outside our realm of concern PERIOD To do this is to ignore the beauty of the South Side while unfairly highlighting only its pitfalls PERIOD

Rather than perpetuating an incomplete perception of Hyde Parks crime students should focus on investigating the circumstances that caused the surge in crime in  and asking themselves what they can do as members of the community to combat these problems most effectively PERIOD Once we start to see ourselves as observers of the South Side rather than active participants in its culture we lose the ability to address the issues that face the city as a whole PERIOD As a starting point it is important to consider the fact that violent crime has actually gone down in Hyde Park students at UChicago are in fact members of one of the South Sides safest neighborhoods.To understand the reality of crime in the South Side students also have to consider the problematic history of the city itself namely Chicagos long history of racebased housing segregation. the South Side is often used as a political tool as politicians paint its problems in broad strokes rather than considering the many nuances of urban crime PERIOD

Most importantly we cannot choose to only pay attention to the South Side when there is talk of danger PERIOD The past year in Chicago was also full of impressive musical performances a thriving arts culture and a series of powerful protests to which UChicago students are no strangers PERIOD In the same way we have to make ourselves part of the solution rather than contributors to the stigma that surrounds the South Side. it is our job to circulate the positive experiences we have had in Hyde Park while also thinking critically about what we can do to effect change PERIOD Paying attention to our safety is obviously important but in the process we cannot marginalize the South Side residents that live beyond campus PERIOD The South Side cannot be perceived merely as a setting we must endure as UChicago students but rather as a diverse community in which we are all active participants PERIOD
