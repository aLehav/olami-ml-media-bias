Eating every  hours is crucial to keep that metabolism pumping PERIOD However being unaware of consuming extra calories adds up PERIOD

For instance many individuals will consume a few snacks throughout the day PERIOD Although not selecting the right types of snacks and eating them in excess will ultimately cause weight gain PERIOD To put this into perspective if an individual is consuming an extra  calories a day roughly  times out of the week this amounts to  extra calories PERIOD Within a half a year an individual can gain an unintentional . pounds PERIOD

Ongoing habits can amount to more weight gain depending on the degree of extra calories consumed by the individual PERIOD

Healthy snacking can create a multitude of benefits PERIOD Most importantly binge eating can be avoided PERIOD Depending on an individuals schedule will determine when snacks are eaten PERIOD

However usually snacks are consumed between breakfast and lunch between lunch and dinner and perhaps an evening snack if dinner is typically eaten at an early hour PERIOD

What should I snack on

More often than not individuals make the mistake of snacking on the wrong foods PERIOD For example chips cookies fruit roll ups and granola bars PERIOD Now one might wonder why granola bars PERIOD Some products are acceptable snack options however make sure to read the nutrition label PERIOD

An immense number of snack bars contain added sugars and saturated fatstrans fats PERIOD Instead opting for fruit yogurt nuts or even dry cereal is a healthier option to consider PERIOD The list goes on and on however it is important to choose healthy alternatives that are tasteful to the individual PERIOD Eating something that is unsatisfying will most likely result in eating an additional snack resulting in additional calories PERIOD

Snack options such as the ones mentioned above are referred to as low glycemic carbs otherwise known as complex carbs which provide satiation throughout the day PERIOD While high glycemic carbohydrates found in sugary and fattening snacks head straight into the blood stream and are used right away as glucose PERIOD This is why people can eat so many cookies or chips without feeling full PERIOD

What should I avoid

Drinking calories away is extremely common PERIOD For example a bottle of soda is loaded with sugar and nearly  calories depending on the brand PERIOD It provides you with  grams of sugar and a surplus of calories that provide no nutrient value PERIOD Gatorade is another drink that is commonly misused PERIOD Individuals tend to drink this casually PERIOD

However Gatorade too contains a lot of sugar and electrolytes PERIOD It is meant for exercise or very active individuals PERIOD Refueling with Gatorade restores the depleted sodium levels which become low due to intense exercise and sweating PERIOD Loading your body with sodium and electrolytes is unnecessary if fitness is not typically being performed PERIOD Moral of the story stick to water PERIOD The body thrives off water consumption and supports optimal functioning for most major organs PERIOD

Another common mistake is the excessive use of sauces dressings and creamers PERIOD Many coffee creamers are high in sugar fat and carbs PERIOD For instance  Tbsp PERIOD of a flavored coffee creamer typically contains 15g sugar  carbs and 35g of fat PERIOD Sauces such as mayonnaise and cream cheese are very high in fat too PERIOD A number of sauces such as BBQ honey mustard and especially salad dressings are high in sugar as well PERIOD
