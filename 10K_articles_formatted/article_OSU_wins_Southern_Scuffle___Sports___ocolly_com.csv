With  total points and  placers at the Southern Scuffle the Cowboys emerged victorious as a team and three individuals were tournament champions PERIOD The Cowboys were in second place after last nights bouts were over but a strong day two propelled plenty of Cowboys to place in the tournament PERIOD Coach John Smith was impressed with how the Cowboys wrestled PERIOD

I thought we wrestled well in most spots Smith said PERIOD There were some matches tonight we were in control of and found a way to lose a match PERIOD But we also found a lot of ways to win this weekend so overall I think it gives our team a chance to continue to develop. the Cowboys traveled with  wrestlers and  of them took home hardware PERIOD It was a good weekend for the Cowboys and the young inexperienced group of backups that followed the starters also put up strong performances on the mat PERIOD The experience is the biggest reason the Cowboys brought so many to Chattanooga PERIOD

Its an opportunity to get a lot of experience for guys and they allow us to bring that many so for that reason its important to wrestle Smith said PERIOD Its important for your guys to be ready and anybody thats your backup for them to be ready PERIOD Its a great tournament for them to be able to come to. the champions of the tournament for the Cowboys came at  pounds  pounds and  pounds PERIOD Daton Fix defeated Chattanoogas Brayden Palmer with a  decision to claim his second Southern Scuffle championship PERIOD Dustin Plott had a dominant tournament and he finished it off with a win over Missouris Peyton Mocco  PERIOD Travis Wittlake claimed a tournament title over NDSUs Deanthony Parker Jr PERIOD  PERIOD Wittlake did well in the tournament in his first backtoback matches as a 184pounder PERIOD

It was my first real test having backtoback matches at  Wittlake told FloWrestling PERIOD Ive just had single matches in dual this year PERIOD It was good for my conditioning it was good for my body my muscles to feel the soreness on the second day PERIOD When I woke up this morning I felt like I got hit by a truck PERIOD Youre gonna have that in those first tournaments PERIOD As soon as you get warmed up and get the nerves out you feel better. the other nine placers varied from second to eighth place PERIOD Victor Voinovich dropped his championship bout to finish second in the tournament PERIOD His match was surely one of the ones Smith referred to when he mentioned losing control as Voinovich held a  lead in the closing minutes PERIOD

Gavin Stika  Konner Doucet HWT Luke Surber  and Wyatt Sheets  all finished third place in their weight classes PERIOD They all had good runs at the scuffle PERIOD Kaden Gfeller 157and Trevor Mastrogiovanni  finishing fourth were slight surprises but the majority of the losing matches were tightly contested with lots of talking to officials PERIOD

Kyle Haas finished seventh at  pounds and the biggest surprise was Carter Young finishing eighth PERIOD Young had a strong start to the tournament until he lost his rematch with Minnesotas Jake Bergeland PERIOD He proceeded to get a pin over Hofstras Justin Hoyle but then dropped his final two bouts by one and three points PERIOD
