Extra ticket sales unfair

I arrived at the Union around  a.m PERIOD Friday to check Extra ticket sales unfair

I arrived at the Union around  a.m PERIOD Friday to check on the line for tickets PERIOD I found the group of true fans waiting in line. there were about  or so of them PERIOD They were asleep on the couches clutching their full bellies from the pizza the night before PERIOD Wondering what was going on I asked one who was awake and he informed me of the roll calls PERIOD I went to the ticket office signed in and received my wristband number  PERIOD I thought I would stick around for the next roll call to see where I stood after all there definitely werent  students in line so I thought I had a good chance PERIOD

To my dismay at  a.m. the rest of the  came stumbling in PERIOD I dont know where they came from but they definitely werent waiting in the lounge PERIOD If only I had signed up earlier I would have been able to leave and come back once an hour to keep my place in line PERIOD

What a joke PERIOD Not just this debacle but the lottery and the Petersen Events Center and the University in general PERIOD All they care about is money PERIOD That is why there are only  student tickets in a 12500seat arena PERIOD They cant make any money off  season tickets PERIOD I hope all students remember this when they are alumni and the University is panhandling them for even more money for the students. forget about it PERIOD If they were the University would step up and fix this by selling season tickets to anyone who wants them PERIOD
