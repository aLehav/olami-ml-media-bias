5307,2011-09-20,"every week this fall Im going to dissect Stanford football from a numerical perspective here at Stat on the Back PERIOD

Number of the game11

What it means Stanford has now won  consecutive games good for the longest active winning streak in the country PERIOD Perhaps more importantly though  is the uniform number of both Levine Toilolo and Shayne Skov PERIOD Toilolo broke out with  receiving yards and a touchdown but Skovs game had an even bigger impact on the Cardinal going forward PERIOD Skov left the game with a knee injury and will miss the rest of the season PERIOD

Why it matters If you have to ask why winning  straight games matters you dont watch sports very often PERIOD But just for some perspective the longest winning streak in school history is  games set in both  and  and the longest unbeaten streak is  games set in  PERIOD Stanfords next four gamesvs PERIOD UCLA vs PERIOD Colorado at Washington State and vs PERIOD Washingtonset up nicely for a significant challenge to those records PERIOD

Skov is one of the teams most important players PERIOD He was the teams top tackler in the first two games and is a bigplay threat every down as seen by his three Orange Bowl sacks PERIOD But if you really want to see how much he means to the team just look at the way the other players reacted when he went down PERIOD Chase Thomas the other half of the Pac12s best linebacking duo wrote Skovs  on his arm in tribute to his injured teammate PERIOD His teammates afterward emphasized how big a loss he will be to the team and its clear that the Cardinal will be without one of its main leaders for the duration of this injury PERIOD Many people have said that Stanford is no longer a national championship caliber team without Skov and that speaks to his importance PERIOD With Skov out for the year it will be up to Jarek Lancaster AJ Tarpley and the highly touted James Vaughters who have played a total of one year of college football to pick up the slack PERIOD

On the bright side Toilolo broke out of a mini funk with a very strong performance PERIOD Last year Toilolo beat out Konrad Reuland Coby Fleener and Zach Ertz for the starting job and then promptly got hurt on the second play of the season PERIOD This year expectations were justifiably high for the physically freakish athlete PERIOD A 6foot8 guy that can move is an asset on any team let alone one with a tightendloving quarterback like Andrew Luck PERIOD However the first two games brought a penalty a couple drops and some miscommunication without a single catch for Toilolo PERIOD After Fleener went down with an apparent concussion Toilolo responded PERIOD Not only did he finally make a catch he made impact plays PERIOD

Toilolos four catches  got Stanford its first firstdown  got Stanford into the red zone for the first time  converted a crucial thirddown in a onescore game and was the longest pass play all day and  pushed the lead to three scores with his first career touchdown grab and also gave him over  yards receiving PERIOD It doesnt get much better than that PERIOD Apart from the importance in this game Toilolos 102yard day gave the Cardinal another proven weapon on offense and showed the team that it shouldnt miss a beat if Fleener needs time to get back to being  percent PERIOD

Other notable numbers

 The number of secondhalf points allowed by Stanford through three games after another posthalftime shutout PERIOD Not surprisingly this mark is top in the country PERIOD What is surprising is that a road team missing its best defensive player can shut out an offense as potent as Arizonas especially on a day when Foles started so hot PERIOD

 The number of rushing yards Stanford has allowed all season equating to  rushing yards allowed per game PERIOD Thats second in the country and the figure could be even lower PERIOD On the first series of the second half Keola Antolin gashed the Stanford D for  rushing yards on four carries but the drive ended in a missed field goal PERIOD For the rest of the game Arizona managed just six yards on  carries PERIOD In all only  of the Wildcats  carries gained yardage PERIOD

 Luck has thrown  touchdowns to tight ends since the beginning of last year PERIOD Thats twice as many as anyone else in the country PERIOD In case you havent heard  times by now Stanford has really really ridiculously good tight ends PERIOD

 After leading the nation in thirddown conversion percentage last year Stanford was just 7for16 on third downs against Arizona PERIOD Thats three straight games where Stanford failed to convert half its third downs dropping the Cardinal to sixty-first in the nation with a . conversion percentage PERIOD Last year Stanford did not have a game all season with a conversion rate that low and only twice did the Cardinal fail to get to  percent PERIOD

 Despite having a fairly unflashy performance Stanford still racked up  total yards PERIOD Thats more than the Cardinal had in any game last year PERIOD

 While Stanford had a huge day yardagewise the team scored a relatively pedestrian  points PERIOD Pedestrian for Stanford that is PERIOD During the Cardinals 11game winning streak the  points are good for the secondfewest points Stanford has scored PERIOD

 Jordan Williamson scored  points PERIOD Arizona scored  PERIOD When your kicker outscores the other team things are generally going well PERIOD

Stanford is off this week but Stat on the Back doesnt take a bye PERIOD Ill be back next week to look at the season so far and what lies ahead PERIOD
