Senior dance major Rhaamell BurkeMissouri is proof that you dont have to find your passion at a young age in order to succeed PERIOD BurkeMissouri did not start dancing until the age of  but has been in love with it ever since PERIOD Now at the age of  BurkeMissouri took the Fall  semester off to go on a Broadway tour that would change his life forever PERIOD



Born in Queens NY and raised in Queens and Holy Spring North Carolina BurkeMissouri had no idea what he wanted to spend his life doing at an early age PERIOD In high school he became interested in dance and began to learn the basics PERIOD BurkeMissouri then started his journey in the dance program where he discovered that dance truly is his passion PERIOD It wasnt always a passion because I thought it was really weird for a man to love dance PERIOD So it took me doing it after high school to see how truly passionate I am about dance    BurkeMissouri said PERIOD

With a desire to return to New York BurkeMissouri joined the program in  PERIOD Admissions told     BurkeMissouri something before he attended the university that really caught his eye PERIOD They told me flatout that my technique wasnt where it needed to be for a professional career but the passion I danced with made them see so much in me PERIOD That is what made me come here PERIOD They told me that they would mold me into something great and so far they have BurkeMissouri said PERIOD He takes classes in ballet jazz modern dance tap dance African dance and hiphop PERIOD Some students feel that dance is not an actual major but BurkeMissouri ignores all negative comments that he receives PERIOD I know its a major and it is something that I will be doing for the rest of my life so I look at them and show that dance is not only a major but a fun and enjoyable career choice. burkeMissouri believes that the university has helped his career tremendously PERIOD Post allowed me to go out and learn more about dance PERIOD I started taking class in the city and meeting so many people in the dance world through that PERIOD I can honestly say that the professors here at Post allowed the drive and determination that was already in me to flourish into something strong. in summer  BurkeMissouri received his first professional theatre contract PERIOD He was a featured dancer in a summer season at Woodstock Playhouse and soon after that he signed a second contract to go on a Broadway tour PERIOD

In BurkeMissouris Fall  semester he decided to go on tour with the show Cinderella across America and Canada PERIOD In order to do so BurkeMissouri woke up at  a.m PERIOD and made his way into Manhattan for an audition PERIOD Afterwards he attended callback after callback and sent in dance videos whenever needed PERIOD  BurkeMissouri always wanted to be on Broadway and in order to do so he was told he would have to become a triple threat. burkeMissouri began singing and acting alongside dance PERIOD When I came to college I literally did everything that I could to learn more about what it took to get to Broadway PERIOD So that means taking voice lessons taking as many acting classes and of course dancing until my legs fall off BurkeMissouri said PERIOD

While on the Broadway tour BurkeMissouri was a swing or an understudy for all male ensemble parts PERIOD On the tour he understudied   parts PERIOD I would rehearse a different part of the show EVERY night because my job was to be ready to go on stage at a drop of a hat and do the show as if nothing was wrong and as if I did the show every night with the cast PERIOD When I got the offer I was told that it was the HARDEST job in theatre PERIOD Now I know that to be true. burkeMissouri said it feels different to be back at Post after taking off a semester PERIOD I got to go out in the world and do the thing that I learn about every day here at Post. being in Cinderella changed the way he looks at his education PERIOD Being a swing is hard and it was only my second job when it comes to theatre so I had a lot of learning to do on the tour PERIOD Now that I am back I get to have the opportunity to get that knowledge without the stress of having to get out on stage and be a part of a big production like Cinderella BurkeMissouri said PERIOD Being back at Post allows him to fine tune his skills and make him a better dancer in order to get him where he wants to be PERIOD

BurkeMissouri wants to graduate from college before making any other big plans such as a national tour PERIOD My second nearfuture goal is to go out into the world and learn as much as I can about what I do to make me an even more wellrounded person PERIOD When it comes to my dreams I got to do that when I was on tour. burkeMissouri believes he is already living out his dreams and has finally found his voice in the world of theatre PERIOD Now I know my worth and talent in my eyes thats a dream come true. published in Features
