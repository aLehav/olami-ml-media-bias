Barron started by talking about what it was like being a teenager during the Civil Rights Movement when morals morphed as new ideas were accepted PERIOD

It felt like at the time you could literally see the landscape of the country changing right before your eyes Barron said PERIOD

Though many of his generation felt minds were changed Barron said his son thinks voices were instead submerged. you did make it seem unacceptable to have those feelings but they were still there Barron said reiterating what his son had told him PERIOD

This new perspective led Barron to conclude that diversity is key. as soon as you have the opportunity to experience someone to see someone else in action no matter what they look like your biases would start to slip away Barron said PERIOD

Exposure to the other was discussed at another point in the evening PERIOD

People who are older more rural and those with less contact with immigrants tend to be less friendly to immigrants SandovalStrausz said PERIOD

A.K SandovalStrausz Director of Latinoa studies PERIOD and Rabbi David Ostrich right lecturer in Jewish Studies at Penn State speak at the Welcoming the Other event held in the LewisKatz auditorium on Wednesday March  

Ostrich brought religious idealism to the panel as he first discussed the idea of the other that is present in the Bible PERIOD He explained that there is a struggle for some Jewish people to balance the idea of being the chosen people and understanding the idea that everyone is a child of God PERIOD

Two times in a matter of  verses or so you have the statement You shall not oppress the stranger Ostrich said pulling a verses from Exodus PERIOD

The rabbi later added to this by discussing the story behind being kind to everyone PERIOD He explained that the Messiah would bring about a better world when someone is nice to him PERIOD However the Messiah would be disguised an unknown leper prompting an ideal to be nice to everyone just in case PERIOD

SandovalStrausz pointed out how immigrants were crucial in making America the powerful nation it became PERIOD However he also brought up the early discriminatory laws meant to oppress the other. laws were created to prevent marriage between Americans and foreigners and some immigrants were even unknowingly sterilized PERIOD

To get a sense of what kind of period this was a few years later Nazis explicitly said when they created their Nuremberg racial laws that they were inspired by the eugenics laws of the United States SandovalStrausz said PERIOD

The recent mass shooting in New Zealand in which over  people were killed in two mosques was mentioned at the start of the evening PERIOD SandovalStrausz offered some hopeful words PERIOD

RELATED

For  seconds no one said a word PERIOD

Theres nothing I can say tonight that says Everythings going to be fine PERIOD Dont be afraid SandovalStrausz said but at the same time behind the escalation of violence is the fact that xenophobes pretty clearly understand they have lost the argument. sandwiched by men in muted gray and brown suits Wadhia stood out not only because of her royal blue suit but also as the only woman on the panel PERIOD

She spoke of her mother who she considered a pioneer. wadhia recalled watching her mother wake up everyday before the sun rose to put on a suit and returning in the evening to change into comfortable clothing PERIOD

Her mothers resilience inspired Wadhia even as she dealt with the intersectionality of being an American with immigrant parents PERIOD Interacting with immigrants for the last  years has also provided new perspectives for Wadhia to draw on PERIOD

These experiences had a profound affect on how I think about inclusion the accident of birthplace and circumstance Wadhia said clearly into the microphone PERIOD

As a daughter of immigrants secondyear law student Shanjida Chowdhury feels like just her existence is constantly politicized and that she walks around with a target on her back. rabbi David Ostrich leccturer in Jewish Studies at Penn State listens to the QA portion of the Welcoming the Other event held in the LewisKatz auditorium on Wednesday March  

Being here I am thinking about how I can support the other but then Im also thinking about how other people can help me because I perceived as the other as well Chowdhury said PERIOD Its this constant battle of identities PERIOD

Wadhia did not hesitate when addressing the current presidential administrations policies that she said have been less than inclusive PERIOD

The immigration policies have tested the idea of a welcome mat she said citing the Muslim travel ban of  the attempted dismantling of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA and Deferred Enforced Departure PERIOD

During the question portion of the evening students and community members questioned the low numbers of minority students on campus the title of the evening and the upcoming lecture by conservative activist Charlie Kirk PERIOD

To the first point Barron said the percentages could be far worse. he went on to explain that the branch campuses cover surrounding communities with higher percentages of minorities PERIOD

Ostrich added a new perspective when noticing that in Florida he experienced a magnetization of minorities to schools with higher percentages of students of the same race versus schools with lower percentages PERIOD

Why be part of a small minority if you can be among people that are going to be similar to you Ostrich said PERIOD It may simply be a matter of personal choice PERIOD That doesnt mean we shouldnt be welcoming. the student that asked the initial question responded quickly by questioning why a student would give up an opportunity to attend a university for the best education even if that means being a minority PERIOD

When Anngelica Peters approached the microphone she mentioned her experience of culture shock when she first came to University Park PERIOD Barron asked her if she would have attended Penn State had she better understood the demographics PERIOD

Anngelica Peters second Year Graduate StudentNational Affairs at the Welcoming the Other event held in the LewisKatz auditorium on Wednesday March   PERIOD

I would say its the reality Peters graduateinternational affairs said in response PERIOD Seeing it now I can see it preparing me for the outside world outside of people that are similar to me. state College Mayor Don Hahn who was the first AsianAmerican mayor of State College spoke of a similar experience of feeling ed in junior high school during which he was racially harassed certainly every other day. the reality is that I havent always felt welcomed in this town Hahn said clutching a yellow legal pad in one hand The harassment made for a very hostile education. but the negative treatment was not what stuck with Hahn the most PERIOD Instead it was the lack of action from the majority of people who did not intervene PERIOD

The biggest evil was not the vitriol of those that hate Hahn said quoting Martin Luther King Jr. it was the silence of the good people. for everyone in the audience Wadhia encouraged those interested in change to be intentional with your words. pay attention to the terminology you use she said PERIOD One simple thing we can do is make sure we are using inclusive language whether we are teaching a class talking to our students or buying a loaf of bread. rELATED
