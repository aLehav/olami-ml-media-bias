One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

June has been a busy month for the Universitys Board of Regents as it recently drafted the Universitys budget and tuition rates for next year PERIOD

University Provost Martha Pollack sat down with The Michigan Daily to discuss changing tuition rates increasing socioeconomic diversity at the University and working to increase state appropriations PERIOD

Pollack briefly discussed tuition equality PERIOD Regents and administrators have been grappling with that issue in the face of student protests this year PERIOD

She said the University has yet to finalize a decision after receiving a report from a task force assembled to research the issue PERIOD

I believe that there will be some kind of announcement fairly soon but I dont have an exact date Pollack said PERIOD

On tuition rates

Pollack said the continuing increase in tuition is due to cuts in state appropriations  which are at half the perstudent level they have been in the past decade  as well as the nature of the higher education system PERIOD

There are kinds of industries like ours that are very labor intensive and in those labor intensive industries costs tends to grow faster than inflation she said PERIOD That is part of the reason you see superinflationary tuition growth in the past. pollack added that such growth which goes beyond the rate of inflation was not a sustainable trend and the University would continue to have to raise tuition to battle increasing operating costs PERIOD

The goal is to find some sustainable path between those two extremes she said PERIOD

The  tuition increase was the lowest in  years for instate students with a rate increase of . percent for instate students and a . percent increase for outofstate students PERIOD

Pollack said the University has tried to contain raising tuition rates in the last  years by being really aggressive at cost containment and increasing the amount of financial aid available to students PERIOD She cited these efforts in the fact that the University now meets full need for outofstate families earning  a year or less PERIOD

The biggest change in the budget is financial aid she said PERIOD We have continued to really put even more resources into financial aid PERIOD That is the one big dramatic change. the challenge to increase financial aid thus lowering the burden for outofstate and instate students will also be addressed through the upcoming capital campaign which will seek to secure billions in donations PERIOD

Pollack said the most important goal of the campaign would be to find donors who would provide additional support to financial aid programs PERIOD

Despite these efforts she said there were too many variables to determine what tuition rates will be in future years PERIOD

We always want to have tuition increases to be as low as possible but there is just so much uncertainty Pollack said PERIOD There is a lot going on in higher ed right now and I dont think anyone can say what tuition will be in two years or four years. on socioeconomic diversity at the University

Pollack said though socioeconomic diversity for instate students has been trending upwards the University is still concerned about the low number of applicants coming from lowincome families both instate and outof state PERIOD

She said the Universitys goal for socioeconomic diversity is to have roughly the socioeconomic diversity of the demographic of highschool students who score at or above the twenty-fifth  percentile on the ACT PERIOD

But Pollack said University research has shown once a student has applied his or her socioeconomic status does not necessarily determine attendance PERIOD

Once they apply they are equally likely to get in and once they get in they are equally likely to come she said PERIOD

Pollack added that under the guidance of Lisa Rudgers University vice president of communications the University has been brainstorming ways to reach out to lowincome students to encourage them to apply PERIOD Efforts have included simplified financial aid brochures and mailings PERIOD

However outofstate socioeconomic diversity has been flat or trending downward PERIOD In addition more outofstate students have been enrolling in the University a trend Pollack said was the continuation of a really dramatic drop in Michigan highschool graduates PERIOD

Pollack said the University was attempting to address this lack of diversity in outofstate students through increased financial aid PERIOD

On state appropriations

Pollack said though state appropriations have increased they did not make up for the massive cuts from previous years PERIOD

She added that Cynthia  Wilbanks University vice president for government relations has gone to great lengths in past years to build an alliance with business leaders and legislators in order to secure more appropriations for the University PERIOD

We are very pleased that for the past two years we have gotten an increase but it has been small and it hasnt begun to make up for the cuts she said PERIOD We are working very hard to try to make our case and really be sure that Governor Snyder and the legislators really understand the value of the University to the state. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
