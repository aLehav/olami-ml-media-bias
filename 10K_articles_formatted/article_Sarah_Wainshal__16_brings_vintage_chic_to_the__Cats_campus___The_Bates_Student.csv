7611,2023-11-05,"the season of Winter Carnival is upon us PERIOD The white blanket of snow left over from December storms still covers the Quad and a strong cold breeze blows around the Chapel PERIOD Despite this bitter cold firstyear Sarah Wainshal never fails in dressing to impress PERIOD

Her plum Anthropologie sweater tops a black skirt from a San Francisco thrift store cinched together by a wide black belt PERIOD Her black Timberland boots and Modcloth leggings make this outfit winter acceptable and totally chic PERIOD

Even in her younger years Wainshal always had a love for fashion PERIOD Her mother would dress her in frilly dresses and bows throughout preschool PERIOD This Batesie was so fond of her attire that she refused to fingerpaint in fear of messing up her outfit PERIOD

During her transitions into both middle school and high school Wainshal began to realize that the real purpose of ones clothing isnt to impress other people although it definitely doesnt hurt but more to make you feel more confident and happy with yourself. this attitude continues to be Wainshals reasoning behind her fashion choices today PERIOD A strong believer in the phrase If you look good youll feel good she feels that if she is proud of what shes wearing her confidence will be projected to others PERIOD

Wainshal would describe her fashion as a bit more formal than her peers PERIOD Much of her wardrobe consists of skirts and dresses that emanate the vintage feel of the 50s and 60s PERIOD She appreciates how clothing from this time period balances a sense of both class and flirtatiousness PERIOD Because Wainshal enjoys dressing in such an intriguing way the outfits simply fall into place without much effort PERIOD

Wainshal loves combining cowboy boots her fashion musthave with skinny jeans or dresses PERIOD She believes that with a pair of boots an outfit can be easily dressed up or down to suit any occasion PERIOD

This Bobcats idol for fashion howto is Hollywood celebrity Jessica Chastain PERIOD Wainshal looks up to Chastain for her effortless cleancut outfits with a touch of vintage embellishment PERIOD

As for local inspiration Wainshal feels that her hometown of Westport Connecticut does not influence her fashion choices at all PERIOD People either go for an edgy or preppy look to their clothing



making Wainshal definitely one out of the ordinary PERIOD However she says our proximity to New York City allowed me to be exposed to all sorts of different styles which allowed me to find one that I felt fit my personality. you can find this Batesie splurging at Anthropologie and Free People or surfing through the endless pages of vintage dresses on Modcloth.com PERIOD

Looking into the future Wainshal believes that for the most part her style will stay the same PERIOD Obviously some of the youngerlooking outfits I have will need to be retired but a lot of the kinds of clothing I like can be worn by different age groups she states PERIOD

So catch Sarah Wainshal strutting her vintage style down the Alumni Walk runway at a choir concert and taking center stage at the Theater Departments upcoming production of The Swaggering Damsel PERIOD
