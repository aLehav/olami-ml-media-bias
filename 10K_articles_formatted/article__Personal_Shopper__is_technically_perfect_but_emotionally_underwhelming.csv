Directed by Olivier Assayas Clouds of Sils Maria Personal Shopper is the story of Maureen Kristen Stewart Certain Women an American expat living in Paris and working for a wealthy model as a personal shopper and assistant PERIOD Maureen is grappling with the recent death of her twin brother Lewis of a genetic heart condition PERIOD The siblings believed that they both had connections to the spirit world so after his death Maureen believes Lewis is attempting to contact her from beyond the grave PERIOD She also begins receiving messages from an unknown number someone who knows intimate details of her life and is strangely transfixed by them PERIOD

The film is difficult to categorize PERIOD Its at once a tense psychological thriller an understated exploration of grief and loneliness and a horror movie PERIOD Really the film is a study in tonal shifts some of which are more effective than others PERIOD Assayas attempts to balance these shifts by grounding the story in a kind of bland muted affectation that encompasses the entire film PERIOD Characters speak at a low mumble the visuals are bleak and graded grey the edits are slow and blunt PERIOD The result is a deceptively simple surface that hides just how much is happening tonally and within the internal lives of the characters PERIOD

Personal Shopper takes a rather unconventional and tricky approach to storytelling PERIOD At a quick glance it may appear meandering and plotless but in reality all of the drama happens within Stewarts Maureen PERIOD Its tightly focused on tracking her emotional progression as she tries to grapple with all of these feelings which Stewart who thrives in muted tones and understated characters conveys in a brilliant performance PERIOD Maureen is a truly perfect character for Stewart  the kind of person whose stony and careful exterior is just a fragile cover for the deep well of feelings underneath PERIOD

Despite Stewarts strength as an actress and Assayass clear understanding of plot and character mechanics Personal Shopper is well a bit of a slog to get through PERIOD For one thing its selfindulgent For example about halfway through the film were treated to a nearly tenminute sequence of Maureen anxiously answering and receiving texts from the unknown number on a train mostly shot in tight shots of the phone itself PERIOD Its so long and slow that you cant help thinking there had to have been a better way to convey this information PERIOD

Even though its drama is wellarticulated through a carefully considered character arc the movie still feels slow and meandering PERIOD It seems more concerned with being artful than with being empathetic PERIOD That is there are some moments of genuine tension in the movie but those moments are few and far between PERIOD Were left with watching a character experience a lot of emotions but nothing in the story apart from the character herself exists to enhance those feelings PERIOD I dont suppose that its a particularly bad thing for a story to rely on an actors performance but Personal Shopper would be absolutely nothing if not for Stewarts charisma PERIOD There are no external conflicts no ways for the audience to feel what Maureen is feeling  only ways for us to see it PERIOD To make a story resonate storytellers need to work a lot harder than simply telling us what happened PERIOD As it stands Personal Shopper gives its audience no reason to care PERIOD Its a shame too  it could have been beautiful PERIOD
