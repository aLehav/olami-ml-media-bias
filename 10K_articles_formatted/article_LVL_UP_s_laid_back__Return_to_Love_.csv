Every once in awhile a band will release an album whose cover art is more than impressive PERIOD Rather than simply putting a pretty picture to a collection of songs it profoundly influences the listening experience PERIOD Perhaps it invites intrigues or just mystifies PERIOD In the best of cases it evokes an emotional response from the listener before the music even starts PERIOD Whatever the exact case may be Return to Love is one of those albums PERIOD Illustrated in immensely satisfying detail and contained by a thick white border the covers naturescape is a crucial almost necessary introduction to the album PERIOD Invoking nature and by extension solitude it primes the listener for an experience centered on selfdiscovery PERIOD At the same time the pure whiteness that surrounds this image indicates a crisp aesthetically intelligent quality setting a standard that the music itself surely matches PERIOD

On Return to Love LVL UPs third studio album and first for Sub Pop the fourpiece outfit finds a highly rewarding medium between fuzzinfused punk bombast and lofi subtlety PERIOD After meeting at SUNY Purchase in New York Mike Caridi Dave Benton and Nick Corbo joined forces as LVL UP and introduced themselves to the world on 2011s quietly released Space Brothers an album comprised almost entirely of quick inandout jams  its  tracks clock in at just over  minutes total PERIOD Drummer Greg Rutkin joined them on tour  hes now a permanent fixture in the band  though he doesnt write any of the material PERIOD The other three split songwriting responsibilities roughly evenly which is surprising given the generally cohesive nature of their work together PERIOD Now following 2014s breakthrough Hoodwinkd Return to Love finds LVL UP crafting the most fleshed out lyrically complex material theyve released to date PERIOD

Opening on single Hidden Driver the influence of 90s fuzzfolk is immediately apparent one almost expects Jeff Mangum to jump in with a nasally twoheaded boy after the opening chords PERIOD LVL UPs lyrics are also just as inscrutable as Mangums always were PERIOD For a brief taste Hidden driver  forming shape inside my chest  omnipotent in the way that it arrests  every sense and every lesson. the exact meaning of these opening lines doesnt ever become particularly clear but the song finds the band grappling with the idea of god  God  and the biblical Fall PERIOD

While fuzz permeates the album some tracks are also characterized by touches of synthesizer PERIOD An absolute master class on restraint the playful synth line that comes in at the twominute mark and only appears twice on She Sustains Us is a testament to LVL UPs arguably newfound maturity PERIOD This synth in particular as well as other artificial sounds that crop up here and there  the sample that opens the track for example  also add an exciting almost genredefying dimension to the bands overall vibe PERIOD

Despite all of the change or deviation from previous direction that characterizes Return to Love longtime fans need not be in dismay Fuzz permeates but refuses to dominate and tracks like Cut from the Vine find more of the clean singular guitar melodies that largely defined their previous releases PERIOD Whats more the band members voices havent changed a bit PERIOD Still the perfect complement for their guitardriven brand of quasipunk their voices are never particularly urgent and remain constant while the guitars set the emotional tone PERIOD

Bordering on monotone LVL UPs laidback gently lilting vocals bring a casual quality to an album whose thematic content could be considered anything but PERIOD Here LVL UP confront the idea of a higher being on Hidden Driver and condemn someone who has recently betrayed a friend to grow old and never find love. in addition to covering all of the usual bases of indie lofi altrock the band has widened their focus singing beyond just their own distinctly personal experiences PERIOD They continue to embrace individuality but have contextualized it with the knowledge of a much greater much more significant and unpredictable unknown PERIOD The idea of a singular omnipotent deity appears not only on Hidden Driversee Naked in the River with the Creator and Cut from the Vine  and could reflect the instability ubiquitous in recent years for the four New Yorkers PERIOD In interviews they have said that they decided they would be going their separate ways if things didnt come together PERIOD Thankfully signing to Sub Pop seems to have had more of a humbling effect than an egoinflating one PERIOD In small print  at the bottom of the aforementioned album cover beneath the river the mountains and the entirety of the lush landscape  are two words Thank you. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
