She slipped the wedding band off like it was a longdreaded hangnail that she was finally able to clip PERIOD She couldnt help but seem delighted in taking it off as if ridding herself of the husband who often had her come back to me with bruises the color of eggplants and bumps the size of small rotund hills PERIOD The golden crown sat on the palm of her handthe last semblance of any matrimony besides the shared house and the already drawn up divorce papers PERIOD

Shell wear it again later of course after were doneputting it on like a child puts on their backpack for school in the morning after their bed caressed them into dreams of the sublime PERIOD Ive told her time and time again Dont put the ring back on when you leave but shes never answered instead she always wraps her legs around me shutting me up and turning me on at the same time PERIOD

I could see the hope she was holding out for him through her silence PERIOD Hope that hed turn back into the person he was when they first married a sweet loving man before he resorted to spending more time with the rims of bottles PERIOD

She always placed the ring on the nightstand as if it were the case of a delicate instrument defying the way she would initially remove it PERIOD But after it was off a new person emerged one not concerned with the wellbeing of what she was playing but rather more concerned with the music PERIOD The shy reserved woman who was always composed in the office and focused on her task gave way to some other sort of person a prodigy violinist amid an original piece PERIOD

This was the woman who could barely utter a word to me at work and yet somehow mustered up a different persona one filled with courage and a cumulus cloud of selfesteem that could never be brought down to be fog PERIOD She was soaked with confidence and a
completely different air to her PERIOD She writhed around playing hard to get but knowing damn well that this was happening because a conductor controls the entire orchestra including the violins PERIOD

She was more reserved back when our affair first started plucking my strings with stagefright like fear that she wouldnt be good enough PERIOD He did that to hermade her feel insecure about her actions PERIOD A couple months of practice however changed all thatI brought out the innate talent in her PERIOD With time I had her hauling me into the filing room pulling my pants down and not caring where we were devising her own plans for private concerts PERIOD But we were in my room then not having to hold the music back PERIOD

Getting her out of her clothes should have been easier really but she needed more
convincing of her talents there than anywhere else PERIOD Like a proper conductor I had to start the concerto with a low rumble that would only tease the audience until the full extent of the musical anticipation was evident and then and only then would the violins play their sweet song PERIOD

I finally tore away the layers that separated our two beings PERIOD Her satiny skin draped under mine in backward embrace PERIOD The backside of her hands clasped within my palms as the back of her head decorated with lush black webs of silk stared at my face with unseeing eyes PERIOD And then just as the symphony was being conceived just as I the conductor with a simple stroke of my right wrist was going to command the violins to rise and rebel against the quiet sanctity of the orchestra the phone started ringingher phone PERIOD

I looked over to see her husbands face plastered on the screen and I cursed every fiber in his goddamn being for interrupting what could have been the grandest of concertos PERIOD She left soon after underplayed and soon to be overworked throughout her busily scheduled day PERIOD
