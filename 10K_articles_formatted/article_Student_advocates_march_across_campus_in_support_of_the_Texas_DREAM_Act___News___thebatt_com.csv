Chanting Si Se Puede  Yes We Can  and with Undocumented printed across their black tshirts close to  students and supporters marched Wednesday morning across campus to draw attention to a brewing legislative battle over undocumented student fees PERIOD

Local DREAM Act advocates marched at  a.m PERIOD from Rudder Plaza to Simpson Drill field to show their determination to keep it a part of Texas law PERIOD The DREAM Act allows undocumented students to pay instate tuition rates if they graduated from a Texas high school or received a GED in Texas and if they sign an affidavit indicating they seek legal residency PERIOD The Act was adopted in  but a rightleaning Texas legislature has the Acts advocates readying to fend off attempts at a repeal PERIOD

The marchers held signs stamped with We have earned it and Education not deportation while chanting Si se puede  Yes we can in Spanish PERIOD The march hosted by the Council for Minority Student Affairs concluded at Simpson Drill Field with a press conference PERIOD

Gabriela Castillo vice president of CMSA and political science junior said the march was the first of its kind and intended to bring awareness to the community about participants determination to fight the repeal of the DREAM Act PERIOD

We wanted to reach out to the community and let them know that we are aware of these proposed legislations willing to fight them and willing to go far out of our comfort zone to do so Castillo said PERIOD We want them to know that we are keeping a watchful eye on Texas legislation. the efforts to repeal the DREAM Act center around House Bill  filed in November by Republican Rep PERIOD Mark Keough which would effectively kill the DREAM Act by by requiring applicants for instate tuition to be citizens at the time of application PERIOD

Roxann Lerma CMSA public relations representative and biochemistry senior said the march was scheduled at an ideal time to combat efforts to repeal the DREAM Act PERIOD

We knew these bills were about to start rolling Lerma said PERIOD We wanted to make our statement at the right time. castillo said the march also intended to advocate for DAPA or Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents which was recently ruled unconstitutional by U.S PERIOD District Court Judge Andrew Hanen PERIOD

DAPA is a form of immigrant relief that essentially extends DACA or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to include eligible parents of U.S PERIOD citizens PERIOD To qualify the individual must have been physically present in the U.S PERIOD since Jan PERIOD   and have a child who was born on or before Nov PERIOD   PERIOD

Castillo said the march was successful and received a lot of attention PERIOD

People saw us and were cheering us on PERIOD Some even joined in to march with us Castillo said PERIOD It was refreshing and powerful. lerma said one of her hopes for this event which was named the National Day of Action is that it will encourage other universities to show the same passion for advocating undocumented citizens PERIOD

What we want is for other universities to start marching like this as well Lerma said PERIOD Universities like the University of Texas and the University of Texas PanAmerican  we want them to join us in the fight. log In
