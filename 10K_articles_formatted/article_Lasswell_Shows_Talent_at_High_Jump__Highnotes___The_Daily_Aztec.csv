By Stephen ChupaskaStaff Writer

Oh are they Good replies Alisha Lasswell on being told thatthe Canadian mens Olympic ice hockey team is leading  in theirgame against the Czech Republic PERIOD I never turn my TV on PERIOD I cantwaste my time the Kilbride Ontario native said PERIOD

Lasswell a firstyear high jumper has an incredibly hecticschedule even by the standards of a Division I studentathlete PERIOD Shehas six days of practice usually with a meet on the weekend whichoften involves traveling to places such as Reno or Iowa plus a slateof classes PERIOD Whats more she is also a budding singersongwriter whohas already attracted the attention of record companies PERIOD

One would be hardpressed to find two things more diametricallyopposed than being a track athlete and a songwriter PERIOD HoweverLasswell is doing her best to dispel any of the incongruities PERIOD

They relate on an emotional basis she said PERIOD When Im doingtrack I feel this drive this feeling PERIOD Lets say I have a bad day atthe high jump PERIOD Afterward Ill sit down at the piano still feelingthose emotions and write a song about them. the drive it seems is that nebulous quality that stokes thedesire to compete as well as create PERIOD It also manifests itself in theaspiration to expand the parameters of ones capabilities PERIOD Lasswelldemonstrated this quality after her first few piano lessons PERIOD

I loved playing other peoples music but it just wasnt meLasswell said PERIOD I found that I was always changing the rhythm alittle trying to add a note here and there PERIOD My teacher would getfrustrated with me so I started to write my own stuff. lasswell who has been playing piano since the second gradeexplains that her songs are not happy per se but they tend to beintrospective in nature PERIOD

My music is based on personal experience  on past relationshipsor breakups PERIOD They are like a diary to me Lasswell said PERIOD I view mysongs as a little section of my life and they tell a story of thattime. she claims as her greatest influence fellow Canadian chanteuseSarah McLaughlin PERIOD

Ive listened to her all of my life PERIOD Shes thoughtprovoking andher songs are very deep she said PERIOD

She has yet to perform live in San Diego as her commitments totrack and school do not allow it but she spends an hour or twoplaying piano every day and building a base of songs. lasswellsbusy life has already seen one of her interests fall by the wayside modeling PERIOD After she turned  her parents did not want hermodeling before that age she spent six months working for EliteModeling Agency which had an office in nearby Toronto PERIOD

I decided to go to an open call Lasswell said PERIOD The vicepresident took an interest they took some photos then signed me PERIOD Idid some runway work some commercials but I didnt go that far inthe business PERIOD It is hard work despite what people say. it was her passion for track that ultimately led to her decisionto ditch the models life and come to SDSU PERIOD

The high jump it turns out is a lifelong obsession forLasswell PERIOD

Ive been high jumping since I was in grade seven and I decidedto pursue it in high school she said PERIOD I ended up making theCanadian Junior National Team PERIOD It opened me up to a whole differentlevel of competing. lasswell claims it was head coach Rahn Sheffield who influencedher decision to come to San Diego PERIOD

He is such an incredible coach Lasswell said PERIOD

He was equally impressed PERIOD When asked about what made him want tobring Lasswell to SDSU the usually loquacious Sheffield respondswith one word Talent. and you can hear him capitalizing the T with his voice PERIOD

He is looking for Lasswell to do great things but they are notgoing to rush her PERIOD She tied for third in the Aztecs last meet inFlagstaff Ariz PERIOD

Another factor in Lasswells choice of SDSU was the proximity toLos Angeles where there is a recording studio or two PERIOD

While she had to give up modeling a decision that Lasswell sayswas difficult she is reluctant to make a choice between music andtrack PERIOD

If someone wants me to sign a contract and walk away from trackit wouldnt happen she said defiantly PERIOD Theyre going to have towork around my schedule and be willing to understand that I loveboth PERIOD The reason Im here is to pursue my track career. lasswells immediate plans call for a meeting this week with aproducer though she will not reveal his identity PERIOD Also ahead thisweek is the trek this weekend to the Air Force Academy in ColoradoSprings for the Mountain West Conference Indoor Championships PERIOD

Hopefully Ill jump high and do well she said PERIOD

Perhaps it takes a high jumpersinger to disprove Dick Clarksancient show biz dictum about keeping your feet on the ground whilereaching for the stars PERIOD","Lasswell Shows Talent at High Jump, Highnotes â€“ The Daily Aztec",San Diego State University
