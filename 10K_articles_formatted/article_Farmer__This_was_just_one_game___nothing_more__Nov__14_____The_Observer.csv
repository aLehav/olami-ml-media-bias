Douglas Farmer  Sunday November  

LANDOVER MD PERIOD  Let the record show on Nov PERIOD   Notre Dame defeated Maryland by a score of  at FedEx Field home of the Washington Redskins of the National Football League PERIOD

Let the record show Notre Dame should have won that game just as it did PERIOD

Let the record show the Irish fulfilled expectations in their Washington D.C. experience PERIOD

And let the record show nothing more than that PERIOD

This was not more than one game PERIOD This was not a trendsetter PERIOD This was not a beginning PERIOD

It was just today Irish coach Brian Kelly said in his postgame press conference PERIOD Well see what happens on the nineteenth of November. for  years Notre Dame fans have waited for the Irish to routinely demolish lesser foes PERIOD Such has happened twice this year  Saturdays win and the  shellacking at Purdue PERIOD Both games were nowhere near as close as their scores reflect PERIOD Notre Dames secondteam defense gave up one touchdown to the Boilermakers and two to the Terrapins PERIOD

But Notre Dame has also twice limped to victory over far inferior teams this year against Pittsburgh and Wake Forest winning by a combined total of  points PERIOD Neither the Panthers nor the Demon Deacons should have been able to hang with the Irish for more than a quarter yet both games came down to the closing minutes PERIOD

And lets not even discuss the embarrassment of handing a victory to an overmatched team in your seasonopener PERIOD Oh yes that happened PERIOD

As Kelly alluded the home finale against Boston College is another chance of this nature Run a lesser team off the field or slouch to the Eagles level and hope for the best PERIOD More of the former is necessary before Notre Dame fans can breathe easily PERIOD More complete performances  from the rushing game to the passing defense to clean special teams play  are necessary before any game can be approached with comfort PERIOD

Our players truly understand how to win football games now and it starts with our preparation during the week Kelly said PERIOD They know that they have to be able to bring all three phases PERIOD Well look to repeat that next week and thats the challenge to our football team. if the Irish rise to that challenge repeating a dominating performance one week later then perhaps it will be time to trust in the talent on the field PERIOD Notre Dame is more talented than the vast majority of teams in the country and certainly more talented than most teams it plays though not Stanford PERIOD But that talent has been overshadowed by clumsiness and apathy for nearly  years PERIOD

That talent needs to shine against teams like Maryland more often PERIOD Unfortunately having shined against Maryland is not enough PERIOD That was just one day one game PERIOD

Then again that was senior running back Jonas Grays first career 100yard game PERIOD Junior receiver Robby Toma set career highs in both receptions and yards PERIOD Sophomore cornerback Lo Wood even found the end zone PERIOD

The special teams unit made no mistakes even pinning the Terrapins deep in their own territory on one punt PERIOD Irish sophomore quarterback Tommy Rees did not make as many knucklewhitening throws as he usually does PERIOD The Irish defense continued its third quarter dominance holding the ninth of its  opponents scoreless in the  minutes following halftime PERIOD

Are these isolated performances or the beginnings of trends

Are these encouraging signs or the fruit Kelly can finally reap

Are these the product of a terrible Maryland team or an ithasactuallyarrived Notre Dame team

Well see what happens on the nineteenth of November PERIOD
