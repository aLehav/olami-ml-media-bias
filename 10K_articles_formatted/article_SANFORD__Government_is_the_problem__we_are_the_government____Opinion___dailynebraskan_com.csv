Ronald Reagan has been often quoted in the past few months held up by both sides in vindication of arguments for or against almost anything one can imagine PERIOD The most used quote of late is  from Reagans first inaugural address in  PERIOD

This is a statement which I fear has done far more harm than good not because it is inaccurate but because it is fundamentally misunderstood PERIOD It is simple and catchy seemingly easy to understand when in fact its implications are farreaching PERIOD

This quote and the idea it embodies when taken out of context encourage divisiveness fingerpointing disillusion and apathy PERIOD It tells us where the problem lies and who is at fault government but fails to remind us of that one fundamental fact We are the government PERIOD

If the problem lies with the government and we are the government then it is within our ability to correct the problem PERIOD Furthermore it is our responsibility to do so PERIOD

Ronald Reagan understood this PERIOD The full text of that much abused quote reads 

Ronald Reagan was warning us of what happens when we become disaffected PERIOD When we cease to believe that the power to govern is in our hands and start to believe it is in the hands of a bunch of suits in Washington D.C. then that becomes the actuality PERIOD

In part this is a semantic debate PERIOD Does  refer only to elected and employed officials Does  exclude the voting citizen base It is on this point that Ronald Reagan and I diverge PERIOD

He stated that we must all  work together towards a solution PERIOD However I would argue that no citizen of this country is  of the government PERIOD We may have differing levels of involvement expertise or power but we are all through the exercise of our voting rights part of the government PERIOD

Thats what the whole  is about PERIOD

Furthermore we all have the ability to run for public office to work serve lobby campaign protest advocate march assemble and speak on behalf of what we believe to be right and true PERIOD Our ability to be involved in our government goes far beyond the voting booth PERIOD

So to say government is the problem is really to say we are the problem PERIOD This is a fundamental truth but it is also a wonderful thing because it means we can do something about it PERIOD

It is not like saying too much or too little rain is the problem PERIOD There isnt much we can do about that PERIOD Government is entirely within our ability to control  maybe not individually but collectively for certain PERIOD

OK so if the government is the problem now what Do we get rid of the government Thats kind of like cutting off ones own head in order to prevent the spread of gangrene PERIOD

That has happened before the American Revolution in  the French Revolution in  and the Russian Revolution in  just to name a few PERIOD Of course two out of those three ended badly with Napoleon and Communism respectively and they were all rather violent and bloody PERIOD So maybe we can find a better solution

Actually we already did PERIOD Its called representative democracy PERIOD

Now our country is undergoing much suffering and anytime there is much suffering there are many people running around telling us who is to blame PERIOD While certain individuals or groups may indeed be to blame for the present situation we are all still in it together PERIOD

So pardon me if I dont sit back point fingers and yell at others to fix the problem PERIOD Id rather dive in and try to fix it myself PERIOD Of course what can I do Im not an economist or a business person PERIOD Im not an elected official or a government employee PERIOD

The important thing is not to let those facts pesky things arent they deceive us into believing we have no power PERIOD That is an easy way of getting nowhere at all very quickly PERIOD But then I never weigh the likelihood of success against the worthiness of the cause PERIOD

Now is time for us to do what we can  even if all that amounts to is writing a column a letter to our representatives in Congress donating to the local food bank running for city council giving someone a job or taking in a newly unemployed relative PERIOD

But most important of all is to not allow one catchy phrase to convince us to divorce ourselves from the problem PERIOD At least not if we want any hope of finding a solution PERIOD
