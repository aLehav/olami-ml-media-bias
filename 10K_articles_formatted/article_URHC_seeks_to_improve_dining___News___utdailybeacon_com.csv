United Residence Halls Council President Charles  Winters expressed

both concern and hope Monday night for URHC relations with Dining

Services PERIOD

Winters said Sophies Place a cafeteria in Strong Hall stopped opening on

Saturdays because of a lack of customers PERIOD He said a URHC member had

petitioned for the cafeteria to be open on Saturdays PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

Opening Sophies on Saturdays as a result of student petitioning was a good

example of students affecting change and  Winters said PERIOD

Scott Ownby resident district manager for UT Dining Services denied being

petitioned for the new hours and said the opening was the result of a Food

Service Advisory Board meeting PERIOD

The other URHC Dining Services issue was Dining Services refusal to

accept a URHC bill that would allow meal plan equivalency in all campus

grocery stores Winters said PERIOD

 Winters said PERIOD 

Winters said if Dining Services does not decide to make any changes next

year it doesnt necessarily mean URHC cannot bring up the bill next year

and get it done PERIOD

Plans for this semester include a student contract with Aramark Winters

said PERIOD The proposed contract would hold Aramark to their word on changes to

be made PERIOD

 Winters

said PERIOD

Winters said unapproved and unwanted changes are the primary motives for a

student contract PERIOD In response to previous questions he has had on how to

hold Aramark to a student contract Winters said that potentially bad

publicity will be URHCs biggest tool PERIOD
