Freshman Forum has spent  hours doing community service which puts them past the halfway point of reaching their goal of  service hours for the year PERIOD
The service committee designed a helpometer at the beginning of the semester for the Forum to keep track of the number of service hours members complete until the end of the school year in Ma said Drake Vaccaro of the service committee PERIOD Their goal of  hours was chosen to recognize UNAs founding in  PERIOD 
A rainy Halloween night did not stop Freshman Forum from completing its fall service project going trickor treating for canned goods PERIOD The event was rescheduled for Nov PERIOD  due to inclement weather Vaccaro said PERIOD
Freshman Forum added  hours to its helpometer and supplied needy families in the Shoals with  canned goods that were donated by Florence residents PERIOD 
The response from the community was great Vaccaro said PERIOD
This just goes to show that Freshman Forum is involved and is doing its part to help the community said Erica Blackstock service committee chairperson. freshman Forum has participated in other service activities and campus events this semester including partnering with Senate to kickoff the carnival for the student body on Nov PERIOD  and hosting Panera Night Nov PERIOD . there are still events left to participate in before the semester ends including hosting a mixer with the University Program Council on Nov PERIOD  in the GUC from  to  p.m. Blackstock said PERIOD The mixer will feature DJ Papa Rooster. freshman Forum will be adding five new members at the beginning of the spring semester. the five replacements will come from the original pool of applicants from the beginning of the school year said UPC delegate and Freshman Forum Adviser Brittany Jordan PERIOD
The members who are not going to have a seat on the forum next semester just had too many schedule conflicts to attend meetings and to be as active as they would have liked Jordan said. once the new members are added the Forum will be holding a winter retreat on Jan PERIOD  to plan events for the spring semester PERIOD 
Freshman Forum has two projects in the planning stage that are leading the agenda for the spring  a communitywide barbecue and a recycling project. dylan McKelvey is leading efforts to connect the UNA and Shoals communities by planning a barbecue festival which would be open to the community and held at Wilson Park. the barbeque festival would basically be a way for students to get involved with the community to show that UNA is here McKelvey said PERIOD UNA is not just a student and faculty effort it is a community effort because we require support not only from ourselves but also from the entire community to advance ourselves and our school. mcKelvey has been communicating with city officials to discuss safety regulations and permits that must be considered in order to host such an event PERIOD Local radio stations have also indicated the event could be advertised for free because the forum intends to donate any profits to the endowed scholarship fund McKelvey said PERIOD
The officials that I have emailed with are supportive of UNA and are interested in helping get the event together but we are only in the discussion and idea planning phase McKelvey said. there is also an initiative to expand campus recycling projects to reach the residence halls led by Mollie Schaefer student issues committee chairperson with the help of Dominic Summerhill a student issues committee member. summerhill is working on a video project to show what recycling is taking place on campus and what Freshman Forum would like to see in the future he said PERIOD
The videos will be posted to our YouTube Twitter and Instagram accounts Summerhill said PERIOD 
What we have now are the five purple cans on campus but what we want to see are recycling cans available to students who live in residence halls Summerhill said PERIOD
The dream is that students would be able to get a bag or bin of their own to keep recyclable materials in and then dump then into a bin that we would transport to the recycling center she said. the project is not intended to be fully active until the current forums term is over Schaefer said PERIOD
