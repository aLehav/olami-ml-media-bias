The University of Utah mens lacrosse team took on Jacksonville University this past Friday March  PERIOD Both teams came into the game defending undefeated conference records PERIOD The Utes looked to take sole possession of first place in ASUN conference play and that is exactly what they were able to do PERIOD The Utes took control early leaving Jacksonville to play from behind for the majority of the game PERIOD Despite a valiant comeback effort from Jacksonville the Utes early lead was too much to overcome PERIOD Utah would eventually earn a welldeserved win  PERIOD

Early on in the game Ryan Stines got the scoring started for the Utes on a beautiful unassisted goal PERIOD Jacksonville quickly answered to even things up at one apiece before Utah was able to go on a  run with unassisted goals by Koa Todd Carson Moyer and Jordan Hyde PERIOD The score sat at  before Jacksonville closed the gap with a quick answer to the Utah run PERIOD With six minutes to go in the first quarter Utah capitalized three different times on shots from Moyer Jared Andreala and MJ McMahon PERIOD Utah took a commanding  lead heading into the second quarter with much more to come from the Utes PERIOD

Utah looked to continue their dominating offensive performance early in the second quarter PERIOD Andreala and Cody Hart both netted unassisted goals to put the Utes up seven PERIOD Moments later Utah added to their lead with a Stines goal assisted by Cole Brams to give the Utes a  lead PERIOD The Utes run continued with a Tyler Schifko goal assisted by Hart and another Stines goal this time on a pass from Tyler Bradbury PERIOD The score sat at  before Jacksonville stopped the bleeding with two quick scores around the 11minute mark of the second quarter PERIOD Jacksonville and Utah exchanged goals heading into halftime with Stines fourth goal of the day for the Utes PERIOD The halftime score was  Utah on top PERIOD

Jacksonville held the Utes scoreless in the third quarter and netted three goals of their own making the score  at the end of three quarters PERIOD

Bradbury got the Utes back on track to start the fourth quarter with a goal assisted by Todd PERIOD The two teams then exchanged goals about a minute apart to make the score  PERIOD Despite the Utes lead Jacksonville showed no signs of quitting PERIOD Two quick goals for the Dolphins cut the lead to  with just over  minutes left in the final quarter PERIOD Utah was then able to get hot at the right time scoring three unanswered goals from Andreala Josh Rose and Stines PERIOD At this point in the contest Utah held a commanding  lead with a little over eight minutes to go PERIOD Jacksonville ended the game scoring four straight goals to cut the lead to just three for the Utes but it was too little too late for the Dolphins PERIOD Utah finished the game cold but still came away with the huge conference win  PERIOD
