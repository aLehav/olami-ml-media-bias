Some time after the release of Weezers landmark power pop album Pinkerton in  front man Rivers Cuomo entered a period of depression during which he painted his walls black and sealed out any trace of light PERIOD

Whether it was his time spent at Harvard or an inability to deal with fame that brought out his dark side is unclear Weezer has never been the same since PERIOD

Evidently Cuomo went from depression to insanity at some point any man who decides its a good idea to sport a cowboy mustache while posting creepy YouTube videos from his house and declaring his love for Miley Cyrus songs is obviously not completely right in the head PERIOD

Its no surprise then that he let Dwight from The Office name his bands new album Raditude. regardless of Cuomos mental state the man can write songs PERIOD Aside from all of the Weezer classics his solo compilations of home recordings Alone and Alone II are chock full of the pop genius and eccentric goofiness that made the altrock world fall in love with Cuomo PERIOD

But the bands recent output has not had the same effect on its fans as the first few albums did and Raditude is no exception PERIOD

The main reason for this is the lack of sincerity that once saturated Cuomos songwriting PERIOD It seems Weezer is more concerned with getting radio airplay than with creating heartfelt music PERIOD

A perfect example of this is the future top  hit Cant Stop Partying. when a demo version of this track was released it was an eerie lofi guyandhisguitar song about a lifestyle of addiction PERIOD

Meanwhile the version on Raditude is a synthedout party jam that features a guest verse from Lil Wayne and seems to draw its influence from some of those Disney pop star tunes Rivers has been listening to PERIOD

You cant really fault Weezer for what theyre doing though PERIOD If the inspiration is gone but the ability to write catchy songs remains why not just take the money and act as strange as possible while doing so

Some of Raditude certainly is catchy just try to keep that hook from Im Your Daddy out of your head after listening to it PERIOD Daddy is the best song on the album despite its ridiculous lyrics it is easily more satisfying than the albums first track and single If Youre Wondering If I Want You To I Want You To which is enjoyable but forgettable PERIOD

While there are some bright spots on the album there is no excuse for Love is the Answer Weezers attempt at a Revolverera Beatles song PERIOD It might just be the worst song Weezer has ever recorded and there were some real doozies on Make Believe. raditude is one of those albums you will forget about dust off in a few years and then cast after two songs PERIOD But at least Weezer isnt taking itself seriously like so many other bland mainstream pop stars today PERIOD
