After having area political and social leaders deny the problem of poverty an Eastern professor is showing an HBO documentary following a number of families in Portland who have been affected by the recent recession PERIOD



Michael Gillespie a sociology professor will be showing the film American Winter at  p.m PERIOD Sunday at the Wesley United Methodist Church at  Fourth Street in Charleston across from Lawson Hall and then helping to facilitate a discussion on poverty in Coles County and its stigma in society PERIOD

Gillespie said he has done research on poverty in the local area and has continuously presented his findings about the issue PERIOD

One common reaction that I get is that these arent our people this isnt our county there are no poor here he said PERIOD They sort of outright reject the data that I have or the people I have talked to PERIOD The information I present is not always taken seriously. this rejection is part of the reason Gillespie picked American Winter. he said he wanted to present a different way to say Here is the reality now. after watching the film Gillespie said he hope people will go out and see how the things shown in the film represent those in Coles County PERIOD

The film released in March follows families recruited from the  help line through their struggles with trying to get help and dealing with the embarrassment of their situation PERIOD

Usually you call  if you need help with housing assistance with food health care and you just need to get linked up with resources Gillespie said PERIOD

What they did is they recruited a couple of these families and did a documentary about why they had to call . the families are an example of many families who were once in the working or middle class and then affected by the recession he said PERIOD

The example families in the documentary lost jobs homes and their financial stability because of the economic recession PERIOD

Its a really important dynamic movie that shows the dire straits that many people are in these days Gillespie said PERIOD

Gillespie said the idea of what poverty is and looks like has been clouded in society and the video show examples of people who do not look like they are impoverished but really are PERIOD

There is a myth in our country that if you are poor or need help that you look a certain way Gillespie said PERIOD What people dont understand is that people who otherwise look quoteunquote or come from a stable middle class background are now just as much in need than those we think are poor. in the film there is a scene where one of the females is at a church for assistance and people around her are talking about how from her wedding ring and her childrens clothing the family does not look like they are impoverished PERIOD

Its too bad that we judge people on their outward appearance Gillespie said PERIOD When you are stable and can afford a nicer house or clothes or a car that works and something happens you still have those possessions it doesnt mean that you are not in need. after the film Gillespie said he will present some of his research on poverty in Charleston and Coles County and open up the floor for discussion PERIOD

What I really want to do afterwards is have a community conversation Gillespie said PERIOD

It will allow people to talk about what they have seen in an informal setting he said PERIOD

Im hoping it will inspire and open up peoples eyes to really question what they see and some of their assumptions because they really truly are limiting he said PERIOD

According to his research  percent of individuals in Coles County are at risk of going to bed without dinner PERIOD

The website for the film has family bibliographies and updates about those showcased in the film PERIOD

Gillespie said this is a difficult topic to talk about and the video is difficult to watch and even after all of his research it affects him PERIOD

The first time I saw it  and this is my research  I had to turn it off halfway through because I got so emotional Gillespie said PERIOD I know this stuff from that academic point of view and it was a challenge for me PERIOD I hope it has a fraction of that response for other people to sit and think critically about it. samantha McDaniel canbe reached at 5812812or emailprotected
