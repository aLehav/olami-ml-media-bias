In my time at USI one thing seems to be a constant change is inevitable PERIOD As a person who finds embracing change difficult and hard to fathom Ive made strides here on campus in adapting to changes PERIOD

I was forced to PERIOD I had no choice PERIOD

Since I was freshman I had a list of required classes needed to graduate and move on with my life PERIOD If I compared that list to my current catalog it would look as if I changed majors but I didnt PERIOD

USI has made changes for the better but there is fine print with those changes and most of the time that print is blurred PERIOD Recently the university made changes to the corecurriculum by lowering the hours needed PERIOD

How did I find out about it you ask A professor in one of my classes passed it along as a courtesy but aside from him and advisors how are you going to find out

I would say this publication but even important changes related to students and the pursuit of a degree fall through the cracks PERIOD USI is changing requirements and catalogs so quickly that its hard to keep up with it along with the loads of work while students are trying to fulfill that catalog PERIOD

Although my time at USI has been a positive experience overall there comes a time when you are ready to bust through the doors and never come back PERIOD

Safe to say Im getting really close to that point if I havent gotten there already PERIOD

Im close to that point because of these changes PERIOD You are expected to be aware of these changes without any hint of the changes actually happening until it hits you in the face PERIOD

Ive had the feeling more this semester than another other time PERIOD Classes that I thought I didnt need I now need PERIOD I find myself scrambling onto Blackboard hoping there is a fiveweek course offered so that I dont have to deal with it in the spring PERIOD

Long story short I lucked out and found the class at a time that works PERIOD

What happens though when it doesnt go smoothly and students find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard spot

Nothing because after all they are at the mercy of the university PERIOD If the class isnt offered that semester youre out of luck PERIOD

USI can improve on communication there are a lot of moving parts here constantly just look outside on campus PERIOD It all needs to be organized and not by the students who are doing it during a pure state of panic but by those who decided to make all of these requirement changes in the first place PERIOD
