The Univeristy of Miami womens basketball gave up a doubledigit halftime lead and suffered a tough loss to the Virginia Cavaliers Monday  PERIOD With the loss Miami continues to struggle to find a way to beat Virginia losing five of their last six games to the Cavaliers PERIOD

Im extremely disappointed in our effort Miami Head Coach Katie Meier said PERIOD We got challenged and we didnt respond PERIOD Its my job as a coach to get this team ready to respond and Ive got to do a better job of that. the Canes   came out strong against Virginia   in the first half creating turnovers and scoring opportunities while shooting  percent from the field and  percent from beyond the threepoint arc PERIOD

Miami turned it up a notch and we tried to play at their pace at that point and thats when things started to unravel for us Virginia Head Coach Debbie Ryan said PERIOD Miami is to be credited PERIOD They took us out of our game in the first half and we had to fight to get back into it. a strong defensive effort and a  run by the Canes shaped a 10point Miami lead going into halftime PERIOD

At halftime I didnt feel a lot of energy in the locker room and I was really concerned Meier said PERIOD I tried to challenge them and raise my voice a little bit get a little bit of the intensity and passion back into the game. meier wasnt the only coach raising her voice at halftime PERIOD Ryan also felt that some of her players needed extra motivation to get them back in the game PERIOD

Coach Ryan had some words for me in the locker room and I kind of took it personally Virginia junior forward Lyndra Littles said PERIOD I dont want anybody to say something that I disagree with so I went out there to prove each and every last one of them wrong. littles who finished with a teamhigh  points came out in the second half and scored eight of Virginias first  points including two threepointers that shifted the momentum of the game PERIOD

After a promising first half Miami was outscored  in the first seven minutes of the second PERIOD The Canes were outrebounded  in the second half alone and could never seem to regain their mental intensity PERIOD

Our rebounds have to be the bluecollar gritty scratchandclaw type of rebounds Meier said PERIOD When were gritty and were tough and were physical were a special team. the Canes host Florida State Thursday looking to gain momentum before traveling to College Park to take on No PERIOD  Maryland PERIOD

We will be ready for Florida State senior center Carla Williams said PERIOD This is just a hump PERIOD We will get over it. rory Lincoln may be contacted at r.lincolnumiami.edu PERIOD
