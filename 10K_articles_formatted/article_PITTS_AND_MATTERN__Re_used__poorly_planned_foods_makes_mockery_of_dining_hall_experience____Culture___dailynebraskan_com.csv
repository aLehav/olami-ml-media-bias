Lumpy gravy pushed me over the edge PERIOD

As I sat in the dining hall eating a bland hot beef sandwich I decided I couldnt take it anymore PERIOD I was sick of Easy Eggs and madeforthemasses mashed potatoes PERIOD I was tired of mystery casseroles and makeshift ethnic cuisines PERIOD My many cafeteria comment cards complaining about crusty hamburger buns and cold food had received little response PERIOD Boycotting dining hall food and living on a diet of cereal and takeout had only drained my bank account and contributed to my college weight gain PERIOD I had even hashed it out with friends and fellow dining hall frequenters PERIOD



 they griped at me PERIOD

As I hovered over my mediocre meal covered with outofapacket gravy it struck me 

I decided I had to do something PERIOD Jan PERIOD  Mitch Mattern a Food Network enthusiast and quite a cook and I launched wouldyoueatthat.tumblr.com PERIOD Together we started choosing the nastiest looking dishes in the dining hall at lunch and dinner PERIOD We began snapping photos and tasting the food PERIOD We started taking turns writing about the ingredients and flavor while asking ourselves and our readers the quintessential question 

In the last few weeks weve tried food we previously wouldnt have even considered giving the privilege of a trip down our throats PERIOD Dishes included pasta and vegetable stew cheesefilled tortellini mixed with soggy veggies and the same old marinara from the pasta bar Mongolian Beef an Asianinspired food made with  fajita meat actual ingredient listed on nutritional information and vegetable tofu spaghetti a mix of noodles chewy tofu and sauce that I now have recurring nightmares about being forcefed PERIOD

Weve witnessed the slaughtering of American classics PERIOD Tater Tot casserole has been reduced to forkfuls of onions and soupy beef mixture PERIOD Tuna noodle casserole has assaulted me with crunchiness instead of creaminess and Ive seen meat loaf ooze grease like a dirty dish sponge PERIOD This isnt your mommas home cooking PERIOD A smattering of onions peppers and mushrooms often overwhelm potentially tasty meals PERIOD

Perhaps the biggest tragedy is that a threeyear barrage of these and other dishes has actually lowered Mitchs and my standards for food PERIOD Take for instance the cheeseburger macaroni we ate a couple weeks ago essentially a cheap version of Hamburger Helper PERIOD Thanks to my incredibly low standards for food these days I love this dish PERIOD I actually squeal with joy when I see it on the traditional bar PERIOD I fear our taste buds may have suffered permanent damage PERIOD

Weve also noticed a recurring disregard for student intelligence PERIOD For example consider the Mexicanstyle cheeseburger macaroni an ethnic creation I have coined  This dish cannot be confused with the abovementioned dining hall version of Hamburger Helper that I love PERIOD The dining hall clearly took regular ole cheeseburger macaroni and added jalapeos and the corn we were served earlier that week PERIOD Then they slapped  on the name of the cuisine as if they had thoughtfully created a Latininspired dish for our dining pleasure PERIOD If this isnt proof that the dining hall reuses leftovers then I dont know what is PERIOD

Because of course corn and jalapeos are the cornerstones of fine Mexican food PERIOD Who in the dining hall honestly thought that I or any other student who eats in the dining hall everyday wouldnt notice This dish is disappointing because it illustrates the care or lack of with which the dining hall plans its menus PERIOD  I suppose it is possible the dining hall prepared a single fresh pan of cheeseburger macaroni just so they could ruin it with peppers and corn PERIOD

Students deserve better than this PERIOD We pay thousands of dollars for our meal plans PERIOD No one should settle for subpar food simply because we depend on nutrients to survive PERIOD Apparently Mitch and I arent the only ones who have noticed that the food were served just doesnt cut it PERIOD Readers have started submitting the worst foods they have eaten to our blog PERIOD A recent post explains the epic failure of the dining halls falafel and cucumber sauce PERIOD

The reader wrote 

Mitch and I rely on the dining hall for every meal PERIOD We appreciate the work of the dining hall employees who produce enough food every day to sustain the students who eat in the cafeteria PERIOD However sustenance is not enough PERIOD Incoming freshmen face the perils of the infamous  which is quickly becoming the  This phenomenon cannot be blamed solely on a students sudden freedom to eat what he or she wants PERIOD Work your way through the cafeteria line PERIOD Look at the options PERIOD Would you rather eat  which is ripe with healthy veggies but is wholly devoid of mouthwatering flavor or a juicy hamburger and fries hot off the grill Like many students Mitch and I often choose the latter PERIOD

With three years of experience scouring the dining hall for something to eat Mitch and I have learned a few tricks such as adding fruits to cereal and combining foods to make a new tastier dish PERIOD

Every Wednesday you can join in on Mitch and my dining hall adventure PERIOD Here in the Daily Nebraskan you can read about the worst foods of the week and learn about our failsafe foods PERIOD The goal of this column is to reveal the problems of serving college students gross food PERIOD We encourage students to submit their dining disasters culinary ideas or dishes they enjoyed if thats even possible PERIOD Mitch and I arent nutrition majors PERIOD We arent health nuts and we dont count calories PERIOD Were just two college kids fighting the evil forces of nasty cafeteria food PERIOD The hope is that someday cafeteria menumakers everywhere  from college campuses to office buildings  will take a good hard look at what theyre dishing up PERIOD If they wouldnt eat  then why should we
