7656,1970-01-01,"for most of her life University student Libby Shannon has never been afraid of leaving her door unlocked PERIOD

That all changed Saturday at  a.m PERIOD

Shannon and her roommate University student Kristi Kraus were the latest victims in a series of unwanted exposures by the infamous campus masturbator who is rumored to have been in the campus area since  PERIOD

Shannon and Kraus had spent their evening at a few bars before heading back to their house with some friends PERIOD The two University seniors normally left their blinds open and the back door unlocked until around  a.m PERIOD when they tromped into the kitchen for a latenight snack PERIOD

We were standing in the kitchen when some guy opened up the back door walked into the kitchen and started to masturbate Kraus said PERIOD

She identified the man as wearing khaki pants a plaid shirt and an imitation of the mask used in the movie Scream. kraus and Shannon said it took a minute for them to understand what was going on they initially thought the person was a friend of theirs pulling a prank PERIOD

Once they realized it was not a joke they screamed and ran into Shannons room PERIOD

We started yelling and banging on the wall to wake up our third roommate Shannon said PERIOD

After waking the third roommate and her boyfriend the four went back into the kitchen to see if the man was still there PERIOD He was gone and had left the back door wide open PERIOD

He just vaporized Kraus said PERIOD Like a ghost. there have been several indecent exposure reports in the past month five or six of which are related said Eugene Police Department spokeswoman Kerry Delf PERIOD In each incident the offender disappeared before police could catch him PERIOD

Rumors of the campus masturbator originally began in  when three incidents of a man masturbating in front of female students residence hall windows were thought to have been perpetrated by the same male suspect PERIOD

Victims of the  incidents described the campus masturbator as a Caucasian male in his 20s PERIOD Kraus described the man in her kitchen in a similar light adding that he was dressed like any average  guy whod gone out to a nice dinner. delf advised female students to be very aware of their surroundings especially if they are walking at night by themselves PERIOD If confronted by a threatening individual distract him or her if possible she said adding that distractions might keep the offender from running away so that police can apprehend the suspect PERIOD

Delf said victims should also get as accurate of a suspect description as possible and call the police immediately PERIOD

Kraus said she was worried that the man might come back to the house another night or that his fascination with scaring females might manifest into something more dangerous PERIOD

Its really scary she said PERIOD Our doors arent ever going to be unlocked again. contact the crimehealth
