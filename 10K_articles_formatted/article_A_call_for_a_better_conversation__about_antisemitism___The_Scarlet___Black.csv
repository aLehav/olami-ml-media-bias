Having gone to bed numb and speechless once again to the news that another Shabbat had passed with American Jews being gunned down in their Synagogueoccurring six months to the day after the deadliest antisemitic attack in American historyI ask my fellow Grinnellians to carefully consider ways that we can work together to improve and elevate our own discourse on antisemitism amid the steepest rise in attacks on Jewish people worldwide in decades PERIOD

To begin here are some facts In  Jews were the targets of . of religiously motivated hate crimes in the United States according to the FBI PERIOD  also saw a  increase in antisemitic incidents over the previous year which included an astonishing . rise in antisemitic cases reported in K12 schools PERIOD These distressing variables have been trending upwards for years now PERIOD

Lest one think it is purely an American phenomenon however CNNs recent omnibus survey of European attitudes towards Jews yielded profoundly troubling results for the continent where one out of every three Jews on the face of the Earth was murdered by the Nazis and their local collaborators less than  years ago PERIOD In countries such as Poland and Hungary over four in  respondents believed that Jews have too much influence in business and finance around the world and over a third said the same in regards to political affairs echoing longestablished antisemitic myths and conspiracies PERIOD This parallels the resiliency of arguably the greatest global stronghold of antisemitism North Africa and the Middle East where a  AntiDefamation League Global Survey found that  of respondents held antisemitic views PERIOD In many ways even after being targeted by numerous massacres in a matter of months antisemitism still remains a slightly more distant though increasingly close reality in the United States when compared to the experiences encountered by the small Jewish communities in Europe and the almost nonexistent ones remaining in North Africa and the Middle East where daily streetlevel hostility and threat has remained a fact of daily life PERIOD

With this troubling portrait of a global antisemitism in mind I implore the Grinnell community which prides itself on advocating for the safety and wellbeing of marginalized communities to extend the same level of support to your Jewish peers PERIOD Though different in both its history and nature than other bigotries the effects of antisemitism remain just as deadly PERIOD Antisemitism is a complex phenomenon which has existed in some form for over  years transforming from a political into a theological and then biological and racialized phenomenon over such time PERIOD It has lived on both the left and right historically and on each side the Jew has served as a symbol upon which prevailing societal fears and myths are projected PERIOD Throughout history Jews have been framed as both capitalist and Communist political elites biological bottom dwellers and many other harmful stereotypes PERIOD

If you would like to learn more about antisemitism and how the Jewish community seeks to confront it I implore you to discuss and most importantly to listen to a large swath of Jewish peers faculty and institutional leaders and consult experts on the subject such as the preeminent American writers on antisemitism today the historianauthor Deborah Lipstadt and journalist Yair Rosenberg of Tablet Magazine PERIOD I also encourage you to learn more about the history of antisemitism and the Jewish people whose roots as an indigenous Middle Eastern people that were forcibly expelled from their homeland into two thousand years of exile play a critical role in understanding the issues and endless persecution Jews faced throughout the Diaspora and continue to challenge today PERIOD But most critically I ask that you take the easiest initial step to fight antisemitism which is to merely acknowledge that it exists  that it actively harms and threatens the lives of our friends families and selves in  PERIOD I ask you to acknowledge that it is not made up or manufactured  that instead it is all too real PERIOD

This does not preclude bad actors from cynically exploiting antisemitism as a political football as attempts at manufacturing outrage are often accomplished on both the right and the left PERIOD However the best way to combat this is to center Jewish voices in any conversation on antisemitism PERIOD These issues are not political wedges or social media likes for us PERIOD Antisemitism is a matter of life and death PERIOD Any time it is exploited for politics no side wins PERIOD Only Jews lose PERIOD

As the Chabad of Poway a synagogue very much the same as the Chabad shul I have attended my entire life buries Lori GilbertKaye of blessed memory treats its wounded and works to repair its irreparable injuries I ask that you take this opportunity to consider how we can lift up and protect the visibility of Jewish voices in our own campus community PERIOD

At a time when white supremacists in the West are increasingly targeting Muslim Latinx Black and other marginalized communities standing in solidarity with targeted peoples could never be more important PERIOD Together we shall work to fight this White Supremacist scourge that may take many forms but whose effects are almost uniformly deadly PERIOD

May Lori GilbertKayes memory be a blessing and may we each strive to create our own corner of a more loving understanding and repaired world PERIOD
