Two yards separated Pitt from a victory over Navy Wednesday night at Heinz Field PERIOD

In a Two yards separated Pitt from a victory over Navy Wednesday night at Heinz Field PERIOD

In a game where both teams combined for  total rushing yards two more meant sending home the soggy Pitt crowd with something to be happy about PERIOD

Two incomplete passes later Navys defenders sprinted toward the middle of the field with their helmets raised high above their heads PERIOD

The fourpoint underdogs handed Pitt  its fourth consecutive loss  in double overtime on national television PERIOD

We were on the 2yard line and we felt good about the play Pitt head coach Dave Wannstedt said of Pitts second pass attempt from the 2yard line in the second overtime PERIOD We figured we would have oneonone coverage. on the thirddown play before the games deciding incompletion Bostick found tight end Jon Pelusi open in the end zone but his pass slipped through the hands of the redshirt sophomore PERIOD

The incompletion didnt matter PERIOD Navy declined an illegal shift penalty on the play which wouldve pushed Pitt back  yards and forced the Panthers to make the decision to either kick the gametying field goal or go for the gamewinning touchdown PERIOD

Stepping out of his usually conservative play calling Wannstedt elected to go for the touchdown and the win PERIOD

It could be one of the most remembered coaching decisions Wannstedt has made in his short career at Pitt PERIOD

From the 2yard line Bostick lofted a pass to tight end Darrell Strong in the right corner of the end zone PERIOD

As the ball sailed through the air it became increasingly evident that Strong could not separate from his defender PERIOD

Navy cornerback Rashawn King batted the pass away PERIOD

It never had a chance of finding Strong PERIOD

Thats our 2point conversion play Wannstedt said PERIOD We do it all the time in practice PERIOD If I had the same situation I would do it again. still the decision came at a critical point in Pitts  season PERIOD

The Panthers riding a fourgame losing skid now face a daunting Big East schedule that features three nationally ranked teams two previously highly rated programs and six teams with a combined record of  PERIOD

When asked how Pitt can recover from the loss fullback Conredge Collins said The same way we always do PERIOD Go out and practice and act like it never happened PERIOD

This one might be harder to forget PERIOD

Freshman running back LeSean McCoy ran for  yards and three touchdowns PERIOD

Collins displayed his versatility in the backfield rushing nine times for  yards and a touchdown PERIOD

And in a game featuring two rushing attacks going blow for blow the Panthers passed on two plays in a row to finish the game leaving Pitt stunned on the sidelines and a confused crowd wondering where the teams running game had gone for the last two downs PERIOD

I guess people wanted to go home or something Collins said PERIOD It just didnt go the way we wanted it to go PERIOD Do I wish we could have run the ball with me or LeSean Most definitely but youve got to respect the play call and thats our coach. before the overtime periods even came into the picture another problem surfaced Pitt could not stop the option PERIOD

The nations secondbest rushing attack hammered Pitts defense all game churning out  yards and four touchdowns PERIOD

On nearly every play the ball carrier could not be deciphered until the piles cleared up PERIOD

But the running game wasnt what caught Wannstedts eye PERIOD

We knew they were going to run the ball Wannstedt said PERIOD What they did running is what they did against everybody for the last five years PERIOD We gave up big plays against the pass PERIOD That was the difference in my mind. on Navys first offensive play quarterback KaipoNoa KaheakuEnhana bombed a 49yard playaction pass to receiver O.J PERIOD Washington PERIOD

It was a surprise play out of the gate but after that the Midshipmen rarely split from their threeback tripleoption set that produced so many yards PERIOD

When they did like Wannstedt said it yielded big results PERIOD

KaheakuEnhana threw for  yards and two touchdowns PERIOD

The statistics dont seem like much but the passing came as such a big surprise every time KaheakuEnhana reared back even Pitts secondary seemed shocked PERIOD

In the first overtime with Pitt leading  Pitt safety Mike Phillips thought Navy receiver Reggie Campbell was going to block him for a running play to Phillips side of the field PERIOD

Instead Phillips jumped toward the line of scrimmage and KaheakuEnhana delivered a perfect touchdown pass to Campbell PERIOD

He just ran right by him Wannstedt said PERIOD
