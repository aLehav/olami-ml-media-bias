1765,2023-10-30,"kirstin Morrison the fourth all time leading scorer in program history had an idea that her final season on the University of Massachusetts Boston womens basketball team would result in something special PERIOD
The senior who also starred on the volleyball team in the fall was fueled to have her basketball career end on a positive note after the volleyball team was eliminated in the first round of the Little East Conference Tournament in November PERIOD After finishing the regular season with an  record before entering the LEC Tournament as the third seed the basketball team still had one major hurdle to overcome PERIOD
With a  alltime record in the LEC playoffs prior to this year Morrison was determined to help the Beacons earn their first win in the tournament when the team was matched with sixthseeded Western Connecticut State University in the LEC quarterfinals on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD
After hauling in  rebounds to go with her  points the North Reading native helped UMass Boston advance to the semifinals with a  victory PERIOD
When I first came into the season I knew we were going to have a good year especially after I saw some of the freshman talent said Morrison PERIOD With the way volleyball went this year losing the first round of LECs made me want it even more with basketball because this is it for me PERIOD Im so incredibly proud of the team and our chemistry that weve developed on the court is unstoppable. now that the team has gotten the LEC monkey off of its back it has now cleared a major hurdle towards a bright future PERIOD This was the best season in the history of the program and the Beacons who beat UMass Dartmouth in the semifinals  and came within one basket of winning the LEC Title. while the senior center who averaged . points and . rebounds per game throughout the regular season admitted to added nerves in the playoffs Morrison believes the teams ability to earn the programs first LEC Tournament win has the Beacons believing in their capabilities PERIOD
The teams confidence is warranted PERIOD Last season ended with a  loss to the University of Southern Maine in the LEC quarterfinals PERIOD Before that Morrison and the Beacons were knocked out of the Tournament with a  loss to UMass Dartmouth in their first game PERIOD
But this year is different for Morrison who is only one of two seniorsforward Brittany Moore being the otheron the team PERIOD As the Beacons reached new heights in the tournament the deep playoff run extended her remarkable career for the Beacons PERIOD
This being my last season here at UMass Boston is more than just bittersweet I dont want to grow up said Morrison with a laugh before the UMass Dartmouth win PERIOD Its obviously coming down to my last games and my experience here at UMass Boston has been everything Ive wanted and even more PERIOD The memories friends teammates coaches and family Ive made here have made it more than memorable and Im sure I will be sticking around next year hopefully helping out. morrison hasnt only been impacted by her teammates and coaches however PERIOD The senior said her motivation stems away from the court and across the campus where she believes she has gained insight on how to succeed in the future without a Beacons jersey on her back PERIOD
Morrison whose career ended with a  loss in OT to Eastern Connecticut in the LEC Championship has always carried inspiration from those who have impacted her to try to help lift UMass Boston to the LEC Championship PERIOD
Playing here at UMass Boston has taught me some valuable lessons about life and I will continue using my experiences out in the real world she said PERIOD The support Ive got these past four years is incredibleespecially from the whole athletic department and Chancellor Motley PERIOD I have to say when they preach how UMass Boston is one big family its the truth PERIOD Ive made some amazing friendships and relationships here that I wouldnt trade for the world. uMass Bostons independent studentrun newspaper",Senior Morrison Shines as Beacons Make it to LEC Finals â€“ The Mass Media,University of Massachusetts Boston
