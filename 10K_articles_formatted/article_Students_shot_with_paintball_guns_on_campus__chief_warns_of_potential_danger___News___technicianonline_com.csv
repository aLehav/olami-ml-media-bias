According to a WolfAlert sent out by the NC State University Police Department two men shot paintball guns at pedestrians on Hillsborough Street on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

The shooters drove trucks and were young white and wearing baseball caps as reported in the alert PERIOD There are currently no definitive suspects PERIOD

NC State Police Chief Dan House said the incident has potential to be very serious if a witness believes it to be real gunfire PERIOD

This is not just some college prank this is a very serious matter House said PERIOD And you know what if that same thing happened and it just happened to be an undercover police officer or something PERIOD Chances are that the police officer is going to return fire but simply real bullets PERIOD Or a citizen thats armed under the concealedcarry permit can very well be saying that their life is in danger and return fire PERIOD So it could be horrifically not only a terrifying event but realistically a tragic event if something like that did happen. house also said more people are arming themselves which could lead to a greater chance the event becomes deadly PERIOD

These days you cant even just assume that its going to be a white male with a haircut like mine who could potentially have a gun House said PERIOD In fact Im a concealed weapons carry instructor and most of my students are female PERIOD So could be anybody you go up against and if that had happened that person that fired back a real weapon would be justified in doing what theyre doing in most circumstances. sam Christy a graduate student in aerospace engineering and president of NC State Club Paintball said playing paintball involves many safety precautions PERIOD Players wear protective gear chronograph their guns to shoot at a safe speed shoot from  feet distances and play in protected areas PERIOD

He also said it can be painful to be shot when these precautions are not followed PERIOD

It can be pretty painful Christy said PERIOD It can sting it can break the skin or cause you to bleed and Ive had that happen a couple times PERIOD I would be willing to bet that if they just went to Walmart or Dicks Sporting Goods or something like that and just picked a paintball gun up and started shooting people PERIOD Its not chronographed out of the box PERIOD So you know they can be shooting any number of different speeds low or high PERIOD But like I said if theyre on the high end its going to hurt. house said similar incidents occurred last spring but did not occur over the summer PERIOD

So just by deduction that tends to tell you its probably someone in the student population House said PERIOD

The events in the spring and fall have included different vehicles however all included descriptions of youngwhite males wearing baseball caps PERIOD

House said once there are suspects the NC State University Police Department intends to charge them with the most they can PERIOD This could include assault assault by pointing a gun or going armed to the terror of the public  which is a felony PERIOD

Christy said these events are not representative of those who enjoy paintball recreationally PERIOD

I wouldnt say that anybody who plays the sport is violent like that Christy said PERIOD Generally anyone whos actually invested in the sport is only playing at fields where the sport is played PERIOD They are not just going around shooting people that would be someone who had some sort of ulterior motive which does not define the people who play this as a sport recreationally PERIOD I think I can speak for everyone who plays and say that we dont condone that thats not something we do PERIOD Thats not in the spirit of the game. staff Writer
