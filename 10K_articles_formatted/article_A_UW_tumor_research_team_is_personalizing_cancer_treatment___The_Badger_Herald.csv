When a cancer patient at the University of Wisconsin Health System ventured outside Wisconsin for treatment doctors recommended a medication not previously approved for his type of cancer PERIOD The treatment made sense on a genetic level but there was no formal approval process for him to receive it PERIOD

As a result Howard Bailey director of the UW Carbone Cancer Center asked some of his colleagues to create a means to approve such treatments PERIOD The result was the creation of the Precision Medicine Molecular Tumor Board in September PERIOD

The board recently had their sixth meeting of the year wherethey heard the cases of two Wisconsin residents who might benefit from a more targeted approach to their specific cancers PERIOD

Precision medicine tailors treatments to a patients genes environment and lifestyle according to Popular Science PERIOD

Mark Burkard codirector of the PMMTB and breast cancer specialist at UW Health stressed that the board strives to make their resources available toWisconsinites PERIOD

When oncologists in Wisconsin believe it would be beneficial for their patients to receive precision medicine they can submit their case to the PMMTB PERIOD The board then reviews the case and recommends the best possible treatment at no charge to the patient or the doctor Burkard said PERIOD They also keep track of the wellbeing of those patients after receiving treatment PERIOD

Precision medicine is emerging in many fields but applies particularly well to cancer particularlyBurkard said PERIOD

Not only do individuals have different genetics that might affect how drugs work but the tumors themselves have unique genetic profiles that differ from each other and from the person who developed them Burkard said PERIOD

Burkard noted that a personalized approach to treating cancer is important because of flaws in the way cancer is classified PERIOD By segregating cancer based on where it originated variables such as cancer growth rates and response to treatment are sometimes ignored PERIOD

To personalize treatment the PMMTB extracts DNA from tumor samples taken at biopsy or surgery and evaluates the  to  genes most commonly altered in cancer PERIOD

From that you often find out how the cancer showed up and what genetic changes allowed it to grow Burkard said PERIOD That often or at least sometimes allows you to design a treatment that reverses some of the effects of mutation. while precision medicine for cancer patients looks promising in some cases it isnt without flaws PERIOD

Some oncologists including Burkard are worried tumors will develop resistance to the targeted drugs they prescribe PERIOD Like HIV cancer develops resistance quickly PERIOD To combat drug resistance in HIV patients various medications have been combined making it less likely for resistance to develop PERIOD Burkard said the same method could work for cancer PERIOD

Thats a very effective approach for HIV and I anticipate that it will be very effective for cancer Burkard said PERIOD The biggest difference is that HIV is basically uniform in its genetic characteristics whereas cancer is very diverse in its characteristics so it will need to be customized for each individual. despite challenges the future looks bright for the PMMTB PERIOD Since its inceptionthey have accepted manycases across Wisconsin and have largely avoided increasing costs for personalized treatments PERIOD Burkard said he believes insurance companies are more willing to pay for these drugs because a board of experts recommends them rather than a single oncologist PERIOD

Burkard said that while precision medicine looks promising in some areas it isnt the whole solution PERIOD So its important for the medical field to keep the wide scope of cancer research PERIOD
