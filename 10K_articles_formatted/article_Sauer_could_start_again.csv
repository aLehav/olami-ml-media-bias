After winning  of its last  games the No PERIOD  Michigan hockey team has resoundingly put its disappointing first half behind them PERIOD Although the Wolverines have seemingly resolved their consistency issues there is still a question that has gone unanswered

Will Billy Sauer ever get any goal support this season

The senior goaltender rotated with sophomore Bryan Hogan as the starter in Michigans first  games PERIOD During that stretch the Wolverines scored  goals with Sauer in net and  in front of Hogan PERIOD Despite near identical goalsagainst averages saves made and save percentage Hogan became the fulltime starter in December PERIOD

Sauer who set singleseason program records last year in goalsagainst average and save percentage routinely became a healthy scratch PERIOD

Michigan coach Red Berenson started Sauer in Saturdays  win over NebraskaOmaha just the second nod hes gotten this semester PERIOD Berenson has maintained that he wants two goalies ready for the postseason and he said the coaches had been planning to start Sauer so he could become reacclimated to game situations PERIOD

He saved  of  shots that night PERIOD In his last three games dating back to Thanksgiving weekend Sauer has stopped  of  shots PERIOD

Billys last couple of games have been phenomenal sophomore defenseman Scooter Vaughan said PERIOD He held us in that game Saturday PERIOD It couldve gotten a lot worse in that first period with all those 5on3s. and the conferences top offense finally gave its veteran goaltender some help PERIOD The Wolverines four goals marked the most scored with Sauer in net since Halloween PERIOD Michigans  shots on goal Saturday were a season high with Sauer as the starter PERIOD

Yeah it took awhile Sauer said PERIOD I was like Here we go again in the second period PERIOD But these guys did great and really came through for me. there was plenty of curiosity behind the decision to start Sauer PERIOD Entering Saturday the Wolverines had scored at least four goals in  of their last  games PERIOD But in Sauers only start in those contests Michigan scored one goal PERIOD

Thats a tough thing to try to describe senior forward Travis Turnbull said PERIOD Its not like were playing any different in front of Billy PERIOD We have confidence in Billys ability to win games and I think we showed that Saturday PERIOD I know sometimes you just cant put the puck in the net. a victim of odd circumstance more than anything Sauer has put on a great face in public regarding his bizarre season PERIOD He has jokingly lamented his lack of offensive skill after lowscoring games and he has been quick to praise Hogan who is in his first season as the starting goalie PERIOD

Asked in December if he took the lack of goal support personally Sauer told Wolverine Sports Magazine I think I was at first PERIOD It went to the point where it was sad PERIOD Now its funny PERIOD

There was probably a week almost where I was just mad but I realized theres nothing I can do about it PERIOD I cant score goals PERIOD I can try but you dont know how much thats going to work. that was the week of the Michigan State series when Hogan became the fulltime starter PERIOD But at that point the coaching staff hadnt decided to stick with one goaltender PERIOD
