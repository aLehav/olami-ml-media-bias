A new year a new semester but unfortunately the same old pandemic PERIOD Nearly two years in and America is still floundering in its response to COVID19 PERIOD As we enter the spring  semester at The University of Alabama it is important that we continue to stay informed and active in battling the pandemic PERIOD

The public health crisis continues to face new challenges as vaccination rates remain too low to prevent new mutations of the virus PERIOD

Before the emergence of Omicron the Delta variant caused an increase in case numbers and a resurgence of health and safety protocols during the fall of  PERIOD It is now widely accepted that Omicron is almost twice as transmissible as the Delta strain and nearly four times more contagious than the original virus PERIOD

The rise of these viral mutations has caused new peaks in COVID19 cases hospitalizations and deaths in the United States PERIOD In some areas case numbers were higher at the end of  than they were in  before COVID19 vaccines had even been manufactured PERIOD Things are looking grimly similar to those early days of quarantine as flights are canceled sporting events are postponed and the virus threatens to send us back indoors PERIOD

With all of this in mind we must reconsider our current approach to dealing with the virus in almost every area of life PERIOD Even with a substantial proportion of the population vaccinated the emergence of Omicron has illustrated that we cannot yet return to business as usual as we have tried to do over the past several months PERIOD

To get to the point we as individuals and as a community must treat the current state of COVID19 with a renewed sense of caution PERIOD Although a substantial amount of time has passed since the viruss original prominence case numbers are higher than ever and they show no signs of slowing down PERIOD

This is particularly important at the beginning of the new semester as tens of thousands of students from across the country and the globe for that matter travel back to the Capstone within mere days of each other PERIOD This only heightens the potential for a surge of new COVID19 cases on campus if we do not work together to curb the virus PERIOD

I specifically encourage all students who are returning to campus to adhere to CDC recommendations and guidelines social distance and wear masks as advised get tested if you contract symptoms and ensure that you and others are protected by getting vaccinated with a booster shot as well PERIOD

At this point there is no good excuse for sitting idly by as the pandemic not only continues but thrives PERIOD When you neglect to do your part you put everyone around you at risk  even those who are vaccinated PERIOD It is essential to make safe decisions particularly in these first few weeks as we reintegrate into Tuscaloosa PERIOD Maybe you should stay home instead of attending that party or if you do perhaps you should wear a mask and be sure that you and others are vaccinated PERIOD

It is a pain to revisit the strict precautions that we grew accustomed to during the early days of the pandemic PERIOD But we cannot ignore the truth todays COVID19 is still prominent dangerous and even more transmissible than when it began PERIOD

By wearing masks in buildings and classrooms we can limit the spread of these new highly transmissible variants PERIOD By avoiding large indoor gatherings and socially distancing ourselves when needed we reduce our potential to expose ourselves and others to the virus PERIOD

By getting vaccine doses and boosters we decrease our risk for contracting spreading and prolonging COVID19 PERIOD All of these steps are simple and effective  by taking them you and I can support a safe and healthy semester here in Tuscaloosa PERIOD
