JOSHUA HARRISTILL D

HarrisTill started his political journey as an intern for Dan Boren a former Oklahoma representative in the U.S PERIOD House in  and ran against incumbent Rep PERIOD Markwayne Mullin ROK in  PERIOD He also served as a legislative assistant in the Oklahoma House of Representatives and as president of both the Young Democrats of Oklahoma and Young Democrats of America PERIOD

He said his platform is outlined in four umbrella terms education jobs health care and infrastructure PERIOD

If we can focus on those four points then we can make sure that were making things better for everybody across the entire spectrum HarrisTill said PERIOD

HarrisTill said he advocates for affordable health care and supports abortion rights PERIOD He said legislation such as Oklahoma House Bill  which bans abortions from fertilization shouldnt be in place since the physicians know what is best for their patients not the government PERIOD

To think we can make any sort of blanket policies on health care outcomes disrespects the entire institution of medicine HarrisTill said PERIOD We need our doctors  like we need our teachers like we need our state employees  to not be constrained and restrained by politics PERIOD We need them to be able to do their job. also HarrisTill said teachers shouldnt be restricted in what they can teach as they know best when it comes to education and what students are and arent able to understand PERIOD

He said limiting what teachers can educate on through legislation such as Oklahoma House Bill  which prevents schools from teaching certain controversial topics regarding race or sex ignores this countrys history which he believes every student should know PERIOD

This country might be a great nation and I truly do believe that but it has a very horrible past we have to acknowledge  and stay cognizant of so we dont repeat those same mistakes HarrisTill said PERIOD

This matter is also personal to HarrisTill since his distant cousin is Emmett Till the 14yearold African American teenager who was abducted beaten and lynched after allegedly flirting with a white woman PERIOD

HarrisTill said his family is still fighting for justice  years after Tills death as Carolyn Bryant  the woman in the case  has yet to be indicted and the two men who confessed to the murder lived out the rest of their lives as free men PERIOD

We dont limit education because we dont like it and we cant pretend like things are all better HarrisTill said PERIOD My familys history is American and civil rights history PERIOD To say we dont want to teach critical race theory  is to say you dont want to teach the history Im advocating for and fighting for today. as a Black American HarrisTill said he believes he has a platform that tells his constituents from marginalized communities he understands the struggles theyve faced which people seem to deeply connect with PERIOD

He said truly connecting and communicating with people and creating lasting relationships with constituents is the best way to bring authenticity to any political position PERIOD

Im able to provide them a more attentive listener a better and more active and engaged representation HarrisTill said PERIOD I can tell these people the truth PERIOD I can speak plainly and clearly and theyll understand what Im talking about and thats what I try to provide to folks. dAVID FROSCH I

David Frosch attended OU for several years to pursue a bachelors degree in business according to his website which he said is the centerpiece of his campaign PERIOD

He said his platform boils down to fighting against corruption in the government and advocating for a sustainable future and economic justice PERIOD

The government has the power to fight but were not actually doing it Frosch said PERIOD My platform is an anticorruption piece PERIOD  I want to get other people to care about the environment climate and global warming PERIOD I know what business majors are learning and I dont believe its going to bring economic equality. frosch said he chose to run as an independent because he wanted to provide voters with more options than what the two party system provides specifically when it comes to economic and job equality PERIOD

I thought very seriously about developing my platform economically Frosch said PERIOD So Donald Trump took the Republican Party in a country club direction and Democrats are interested in racial issues and gun control  whereas what Im doing is trying to raise class consciousness PERIOD This is a great opportunity to fight for the right to a union which is what I pledged to do if Im elected. he said the environment is something he is passionate about and the Green Transition Plan he outlines on his website draws on his knowledge of business and aims to be a seamless transition to renewable energy PERIOD

Frosch said his opponents specifically Bice is also seeking American energy independence which he believes is admirable PERIOD However he said be plans to build additional renewable infrastructure so that Oklahoma has energy outside of the oil and gas markets PERIOD

Now is the time to fight for the wellbeing of our planet and to fight for the future of our life on this planet Frosch said PERIOD Earth will continue to exist no matter if my plan passes or not but  we can do better than what were doing. ultimately he said his platform is built from issues that matter to him as well as constituents he has spoken to PERIOD

Selfgovernment is going into neighborhoods and offering people a choice Frosch said PERIOD Im trying to offer people the very best choice I can think of and what I believe the government can do with health care jobs programs affordable housing and a better workplace. the general election is on Tuesday Nov PERIOD  PERIOD To check your voter registration visit the OK Voter Portal PERIOD
