5992,2023-07-11,"the Austin Police Department has issued more than  citations related to the newly implemented Dont Block the Box campaign which started April  PERIOD

The campaign targeted at downtown Austin aims to reduce traffic bottling  when cars stopped in the middle of an intersection block the rest of traffic flow according to City Council member Ann Kitchen PERIOD

Over the twoweek period from April  to Friday APD issued  moving violations and  nonmoving violations as well as 90warning citations PERIOD

It is still on the evaluation stage but there are reports at least from the police department that they are seeing some improvements from it in seeing people changing their behavior Kitchen who is head of the citys Mobility Committee said PERIOD Drivers are learning how to make sure they dont end up in the middle of the intersection. mayor Steve Adler said hes been watching the Dont Block the Box campaign implementation from his office PERIOD

Ive been watching people get tickets from City Hall Adler said PERIOD

Adler said Dont Block the Box is only one tool in the Citys belt to combat Austins growing traffic congestion problem PERIOD City Manager Marc Ott released the Transportation Congestion Action Plan on March  an outline of solutions to traffic including short and longterm fixes PERIOD

Were limiting left turns in traffic coordinating construction activity PERIOD Were going to be synchronizing lights  in real time so it will shift with the traffic Adler said PERIOD Dont Block the Box was one of  different initiatives we are trying. kitchen said she thinks immediate solutions are critical to solving the Citys traffic problems PERIOD

We grow so fast  that we dump a lot of additional traffic on existing roads and are not fast enough at adjusting to how those roads can handle the traffic Kitchen said PERIOD With these kinds of actions you get more bang for your buck because you can do them faster and less costly PERIOD They are infrastructure things we need to doright away. dJ Roberts a radiotelevisionfilm and history sophomore said he tends to disregard traffic infractions such as blocking intersections when he is in a hurry PERIOD

I think solutions dealing with infrastructure would be far more effective than those shifting the mentality of Austin drivers Roberts said PERIOD While getting people to stay out of the box might help on a smaller scale Austins traffic problem is the result of an infrastructure not built for the Citys growing problem. mobility affects many other issues such as cost of living so Kitchen said shortterm solutions are not enough to fix Austins traffic problem PERIOD

It is a huge issue all over the city and also a linchpin issue Kitchen said PERIOD If we cant get around  because of transportation and were stuck in traffic  then we cant get to jobs and school and it impacts where we can live PERIOD Its a linchpin issue that way PERIOD It affects a lot ofother things. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",Austin fights congestion with “Don’t Block the Box” campaign – The Daily Texan,University of Texas Austin
