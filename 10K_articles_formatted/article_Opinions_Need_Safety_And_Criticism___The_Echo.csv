9620,2020-12-12,"the University of Chicago recently distributed a letter to incoming first years that the university does not support trigger warnings or safe spaces. what does this mean for discussion of difficult conversations across other college campuses

First what must be defined is the word safe space PERIOD As defined by UoC and its letter it is a space for students to retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own according to the Chicago Tribune PERIOD

This on paper seems a reasonable request made by UoC but itis essentially a warning to incoming students PERIOD A warning that states there will be no coddling of opinions nor sheltering from opposition PERIOD Where your opinions will be called into question and disagreement will be as common as the contrary PERIOD

As a university community beliefs and opinions should always be open to scrutiny or close examination.Beliefs and opinions might even become stronger but other beliefs and opinions that may be based on erroneous facts or steeped in prejudice and bias should be challenged Juanita Hall Senior Director of Multicultural and International Student Services said in an email interview PERIOD

Hall is at the forefront of leading constructive and often difficult conversations for students as she is the leader of Difficult Dialogues at California Lutheran University PERIOD Her stance similar to UoCs is one that wishes to do away with this overprotection PERIOD

Additionally as incoming first years come to universities like Cal Lutheran it is natural for most of them to encounter disagreements in and out of the classroom but that disagreement shouldnt be avoided nay welcomed and encouraged PERIOD

This is how we grow together as human beings productive members of society and global leaders  Hall said PERIOD

The implementation of these spaces seems highly destructive to the community discussion and discourse in general and has fostered a firm opposition to them from faculty like Hall PERIOD However there are some that view the idea as illdefined PERIOD

I create safe spaces in all of my classes PERIOD I dont create them to avoid controversial topics but to deal with them. said religion professor Peter Carlson PERIOD

This is what higher education is supposed to be accomplishing in the first place PERIOD Institutions like UoC and Cal Lutheran are places where opinions and positions should be challenged but in a healthy way PERIOD

What this letter seems to be doing is forgetting that the voices of these marginalized communities continually find themselves in positions where their voice is not heard not respected and in some cases violently disagreed with PERIOD

The reason you create a safe space is not so that people can feel comfortable but so that they quite literally feel safe Carlson said PERIOD

Here at Cal Lutheran it is the safe spaces that allow free discussion of issues that are challenging but it has been seenby Carlson that the interaction of students helps work through the difficulty PERIOD

The goal should be to oppose that status quo to eradicate the idea that a person cannot share their opinion if the opinion is in the minority PERIOD They should be able to share their opinion however it is the audience and their peers that pose the most danger to a stagnate conversation PERIOD

Too often it seems that trigger warnings and safe spaces are seen as devices of the liberal academy to make college easier PERIOD My classes are anything but easy PERIOD But I think they are safe spaces PERIOD I teach Queer Theology youre going to be dealing with some really hard subjects and I can offer a safe classroom for that Carlson said PERIOD

Carlson is offering something that most if not all professors want for their students a safe environment for discussion to happen PERIOD

Without this necessary aspect of high education what is to be expected from the future generations that college is a place where opinions are only validated and not questioned Not so under Carlsons and Halls watch PERIOD
