Kasey Zollo News EditorFebruary  

This weekend the Student Government Association created a petition with the end result of GSU staying open longer than just  PM PERIOD

GSUs caf is only open from  pm and most classes do not end till about  or  PERIOD Meaning students do not have any food options open to them on campus besides commons or Starbucks at that particular time period PERIOD This effects a lot of commuter students who may have a class inbetween GSUs closing who do not have swipes for commons and who live just a little too far to drive back home to eat before class PERIOD This also effects residential students who may not have enough time to go back to their dorms to eat before their next class PERIOD This can result in students being late to class which can affect their grades PERIOD

The hopeful goal of this petition is to change GSUs lunch hour from 113pm to possibly being open from  am to a significantly better and later time PERIOD There has not been a definite time picked for the new closing but if the petition gets more than  signatures the conversation will be pushed to be heard from SGA PERIOD

The petition can be found in the bio of the SGA Instagram as well as most members on the SGA PERIOD The Instagram is uhartfordsga
