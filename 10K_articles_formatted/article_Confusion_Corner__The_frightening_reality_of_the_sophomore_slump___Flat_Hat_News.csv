8445,2023-11-05,"everyone knows about the freshman  PERIOD More than a myth it is an established rite of passage for those entering college PERIOD Why bother embarrassing yourself on the Stairmaster when you can do it by falling up the stairs of James Blair Hall in your rush to get to history class And healthy foods Like Ron Swanson puts it in Parks and Recreation Vegetables are the food that my food eats. truly theres no shortage of excuses for skipping the gym and no shortage of lessthanhealthy snacks available on campus PERIOD Frankly its a miracle if the freshman  stops at  PERIOD However theres a more dangerous tradition lurking just around the corner ready to hit you as soon as the first semester of second year begins PERIOD

Its called the sophomore slump PERIOD And you should be very very afraid PERIOD

As midterms approach the ailment has become more serious PERIOD Its no longer just readings that Im pushing back I cant even complete more serious jobs like writing papers or studying for exams PERIOD

Wikipedia defines sophomore slump asan instance in which a second or sophomore effort fails to live up to the standards of the first effort.As always my favorite encyclopedia is on point PERIOD As I write this article I have approximately  tabs open in Google Chrome PERIOD Most of them social media sites PERIOD Im also watching John Tucker Must Die and eating the sandwich I made myself for dinner PERIOD Frankly my freshman self would be appalled by my academic state of affairs PERIOD

Its clear that my multitasking has reached unprecedented levels and by that I mean Ive figured out how to slack off without feeling like Im slacking off PERIOD I do little tasks like write lists of all the homework I havent started as I watch YouTube makeup videos on how to contour like Kim Kardashian PERIOD Those little tasks help hide me from the truth I am deeply perhaps inescapably entrenched in the sophomore slump PERIOD

As midterms approach the ailment has become more serious PERIOD Its no longer just readings that Im pushing back I cant even complete more serious jobs like writing papers or studying for exams PERIOD Theoretically I care about my grades but that concern remains theoretical until I actually get assignments back and realize the results of my lack of effort PERIOD

At night when Netflix asks me if Im still watching I always answer in the affirmative PERIOD Ive actually started working out not because I enjoy it but because its a method of procrastination that makes me feel less guilty than most of my others PERIOD During freshman year I could spend hours in Earl Gregg Swem Library without feeling antsy this year I typically pack it up after  minutes tops PERIOD

I know Im not alone here PERIOD My fellow sophomores can relate PERIOD My roommate and I encourage each others procrastination on a daily basis PERIOD For instance she is currently three seasons deep in a Sex and the City rewatch which I have adamantly supported her favorite is Charlotte mine is Carrie PERIOD

Among all of my peers the Snapchat stories depicting students hard at work at Swem have dwindled PERIOD With harder classes and declarations of majors on the horizon along with the absence of the excitement and newness of freshman year sophomore year is a force with which no one wants to reckon PERIOD I can only hope that I will be able to dig myself out of the hole Im in PERIOD

Cameron Murphy is a Confusion Corner columnist who is always on the lookout for new ways to procrastinate PERIOD Suggestions are welcome PERIOD
