While the Humans of New York blog is building a sense of community in the big city a Humans of the U Facebook page is doing the same on campus PERIOD

Tyler McDaniel a junior in mathematics and sociology currently runs the page PERIOD It began as Voices of Salt Lake in November  but he decided to focus on the Us campus and changed the name PERIOD

McDaniels group was slow to start with about  followers after one year PERIOD Then Humans of Salt Lake City teamed up with them and helped to double the numbers in a couple of days PERIOD Now with more than  followers McDaniel said the Facebook group continues to grow PERIOD He has been happy with the success up to this point saying the page unites campus PERIOD

In general social media is very selfcentered he said PERIOD You get on and think about yourself PERIOD All Humans of groups are examples of how social media can actually build a sense of community. since Humans of New York has gained popularity its no wonder that another group on campus the First Year Council with ASUU had a similar idea to make a Humans of the U group PERIOD Amy Loret a freshman in biology and member of the First Year Council said when they heard about McDaniels page they decided to work together PERIOD

From Feb PERIOD  to the  the council will host a Humans of the U photo contest through Instagram PERIOD A bestoftheweek photo will be chosen by the council and winners will receive a  gift card to Amazon PERIOD Loret said each person who posts with HumansoftheU will have their name placed in a raffle to win prizes from University Credit Union the U Campus Store and other companies PERIOD

Mohan Sudabattula a freshman in biology was one of the council members who contributed to the idea of a twoweek Humans of the U project PERIOD

Our aim is to find people that we feel need to be recognized he said PERIOD We want to spotlight people with interesting backgrounds stories and passions. each day during the event the council will be posting their own Humans of the U story PERIOD Sudabattula said finding unknown stories and people was difficult but through nominations by students they now have two weeks worth of individuals to spotlight PERIOD

McDaniel and other members of the Facebook group find stories by taking out their cameras and approaching people PERIOD Once they mention Humans of New York McDaniel said people seem to open up PERIOD He has enjoyed discovering personal connections with people he has just met and said hes had some very random conversations but meaningful experiences PERIOD

You never know what people are going to tell you when you start asking them questions he said PERIOD

The council wants to keep to this spirit and not just highlight the typical student PERIOD Sudabattula is excited for every outstanding individual they find PERIOD They hope the hype for the two week project will spike an interest in McDaniels ongoing Facebook page PERIOD

It could crash and burn if nothing happens Sudabattula said PERIOD Or once the ball goes rolling it will keep rolling. emailprotected
