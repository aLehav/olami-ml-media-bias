UGAs volleyball team warms up before the start of Georigas NCAA match against Kentucky at Stegeman Coliseum on Thursday Nov PERIOD   in Athens Ga PERIOD PhotoDavid A PERIOD Barnes

Not only did Georgia volleyball get to face No  Kentucky but it also got to play them in the Stegeman Coliseum PERIOD

The team usually faces their opponents in the volleyball complex inside Ramsey but every season the team gets the opportunity to get a change of venue at home for a game PERIOD

Playing in Stegeman gives the girls a larger area to serve PERIOD It also adds several aspects to the game that creates more hype for the players and fans PERIOD

Stegeman is always fun said sophomore setter Kendall Kazor We have the video board which is awesome and the atmosphere which is just a really cool environment. the team was able to make hype videos for the gym to be displayed to the crowd during the game PERIOD The players were able to watch themselves and see replays of the game PERIOD This is not something possible for the team at Ramsey PERIOD

Getting the opportunity for the team to play in the famous Stegeman Coliseum added some enthusiasm to the girls attitude for this game against the Wildcats PERIOD

It certainly gave us some of the excitement of being in the gym said head coach Lizzy Stemke PERIOD That helped us early on coming out of the tunnel. the game in Stegeman added a bit of a different angle to the game but it was weird for the players at the same time PERIOD They are very use to playing on the court at Ramsey PERIOD

Obviously Ramsey is close to my heart because thats our home said Kazor PERIOD Its always a great experience to play in Stegmen as well. when it came to the actual play of the team in the game Stegeman was not a source to either hurt or help the team PERIOD The success as well as the mistakes can be attributed to other factors but the new setting for the game was not to blame PERIOD

At this point right now we are looking to improve and I dont know if its about a venue or about a site said Stemke PERIOD Its about getting better as a team with Georgia Volleyball. the Georgia volleyball team added two recruitson Wednesdayafternoon PERIOD

A team is like a body one living being with many moving parts PERIOD

This season the Gymdogs intend to have more difficult tumbling on floor than they had last year even though its not necessary to meet the NCA

The day of competition dedicated to event finals at the NCAA gymnastics championship has been eliminated but the meet will now be televised l
