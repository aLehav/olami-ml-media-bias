1537,2023-10-27,"all TCU PERIOD All the time PERIOD

The first six innings were fairly silent for both TCU and UT Arlington with both teams having no more than one run each PERIOD

Then in the seventh inning everything changed PERIOD The Mavericks offense explodeddriving in seven runs in the seventh inningand TCU couldnt answer with a run of its own PERIOD

Those seven runs put a stamp on UT Arlingtons  win upsetting No PERIOD  TCU   Big 12Tuesday night at Clay Gould Ballpark in Arlington PERIOD

Despite the seventh inning fallout TCU head coach Jim Schlossnagle said he was pleased with how his team played PERIOD

We had a lot of good atbats he said PERIOD We just didnt string them together and we didnt have balls fall in so this is a great example of baseballs a really tough game sometimes. schlossnagle said he didnt see a need to replace lefthanded pitcherTyler Alexanderearlier in the inning either PERIOD

Alexander had struck out the first batter while the next batter flied out to center field PERIOD He only needed one out to end the inning and get the Frogs back on offense PERIOD

Then came a single by UT Arlingtons R.J PERIOD Williams and another single by Darien McLemore PERIOD

With two men on base a member of TCUs staff approached Alexander at the mound PERIOD It looked as if Alexanders night was over PERIOD

But Scholossnagle said he was still confident that Alexander could get the third out PERIOD

I still liked Tylers stuff Schlossnagle said PERIOD He had two outs nobody on a couple groundball singles PERIOD I still felt good about him as a pitcher. so Alexander stayed on the mound PERIOD UTAsBrady Coxthen wacked the ball toward right center for a double to send his teammates home PERIOD

After Alexander walked another batter it was time for a change.Brian Trieglafftook over on the mound but struggled to get that final out to end the inning PERIOD Runner after runner dashed to home plate until Trieglaff managed a strikeout to put the inning to an end PERIOD

Eight runs is the most TCU has allowed all season in a single game PERIOD

UT Arlington   Sun Belt had not scored more than four runs in each of its last five games PERIOD The Mavericks struggling offense entered Tuesdays game on a fivegame losing streak PERIOD That streak is over now PERIOD

The credit did not just belong to the offense though PERIOD UT Arlington went through a series of four pitchers to limit TCU to one run PERIOD

The Frogs only run came fromConnor Wanhanen who came to bat asKeaton Jonesstood on base PERIOD When the pitch came Wanhanen sent the ball into right field for a RBI triple driving Jones into home plate PERIOD

UTA pitcher Jake Wilcox then stepped out of the bullpen to replace Zach Hobbs who had allowed Wanhanens triple PERIOD Hobbs efficiently kept the Frogs at bay not allowing any runs until he was replaced by freshmanDaniel Jamesin the seventh inning PERIOD James  who pitched three innings took credit for the win PERIOD

Alexander  took the loss ending the Frogs fourgame winning streakan upset by a team who entered the game standingfour spots from the bottom of their conference PERIOD

Schlossnagle said TCU who will face a series against Texas Tech beginning Thursday still has respect for UT Arlington PERIOD

Were not surprised he said PERIOD I dont think our guys had their head in the clouds.",UT Arlington upsets No. 2 TCU after explosive seventh inning  | TCU 360,Texas Christian University
