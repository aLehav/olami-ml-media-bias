Dr PERIOD John Wheat professor of community and rural medicine said the RMSP takes into account the special environments and people of rural Alabama PERIOD

The RMSP program also recognizes the major differences between practicing medicine in rural areas and practicing in urban areas PERIOD

Rural practice and rural living are all tied together in the fish bowl of small town existence he said.The relationships you have with patients are acted out in the office at church at school at the post office at the store etc PERIOD There is a richer understanding of patients and their families lives and greater need to balance ones medical identity with ones other roles PERIOD

Often the time caring for patients is longer but the rewards both financial and in personal fulfillment are often greater as one embeds vocational activity within their larger identity with the community. even though an MD degree is the primary goal of the program RMSP students can also complete their baccalaureate degree earn a masters degree receive a Certificate of Rural Community Health and take medical school prerequisite courses in preparation for medical school PERIOD
