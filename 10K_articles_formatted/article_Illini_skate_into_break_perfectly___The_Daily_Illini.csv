We graduated quite a few key players off of last years team Cassel said PERIOD We knew that we were going to need the newcomers to step in and play well and they have done that and I think thats why weve continued to have the success. while the offense has been performing at an alltime high the defense has quietly put together a solid first semester PERIOD In seven of Illinois games the Illini defense has allowed only  shots or less PERIOD

Combined with its good defense Illinois has received solid goaltending from last years ACHA Tournament Most Valuable Player junior Mike DeGeorge PERIOD While DeGeorge has had his moments of vulnerability during the season he still ranks among the top goaltenders in the ACHA with a goalsagainst average of . and a . percent save percentage PERIOD

Weve had a great team effort overall Cassel said PERIOD It starts in net and Mike has played very well for the most part PERIOD When he has struggled his teammates have picked him up and he has picked his teammates up as well. of the Illinis  wins  have come against ranked teams including two dominant wins over seventhranked Lindenwood University and two big road victories over ninthranked Robert Morris College PERIOD

But Illinois at times this year has struggled against weaker teams and has allowed games to be closer than the Illini would like PERIOD It took overtime to pull out a  win in the game at Kent State to get a Central States Collegiate Hockey League conference victory PERIOD

We had a couple tough wins sophomore Drew Heredia said PERIOD Its hard to stay undefeated even if youre playing lower level teams PERIOD Weve had a good consistent effort and now have a big second semester. the task at hand now for the Illini is maintaining the momentum they have gathered in their first semester of play PERIOD But keeping that momentum wont be easy PERIOD The Illinis first games after break are on the road against Ohio University and Penn State PERIOD

Its going to be difficult to maintain all the momentum Roesch said PERIOD Everyone knows that the first two weekends back for us are going to be the biggest games of the year PERIOD We have to come out with the mindset that were playing two of the best teams in the league Ohio and Penn State PERIOD We have to come out and work hard when we get back from break. the backtoback road trip at the beginning of January will be the toughest test of the year PERIOD CSCHL rival Ohio  is tied for second with the Illini in the CSCHL conference with  points and is ranked third in the ACHA standings PERIOD The last time the Bobcats played the Illini was in last seasons CSCHL conference tournament it was also the last time Illinois lost PERIOD

The twogame set at Ohio on Jan PERIOD  will be a good warm up for the Illini the following weekend at 4thranked Penn State  PERIOD The games will mark the rematch of last years ACHA National Championship game in which the Illini upset the Nittnay Lions  PERIOD

We are coming back on New Years Day to practice and get ready DeGeorge said PERIOD These are our first real tests of next semester and our  record means nothing if we dont cap them off PERIOD Were going to have to use the  wins and the team chemistry that were getting to just roll right through them.",Illini skate into break perfectly - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
