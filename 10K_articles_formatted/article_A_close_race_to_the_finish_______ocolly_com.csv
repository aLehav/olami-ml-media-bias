Millions of Americans and people around the world watched the strangest election that our nation has ever seen PERIOD Political historians and analysts agree  it was the most interesting race ever PERIOD



Not since Andrew Jackson received the majority of popular votes and John Quincy Adams the majority of electoral votes has an election been so close or intriguing PERIOD



Students and people across the nation held watch parties  as focused on the election as those watching the Super Bowl would be PERIOD As each candidate scored a touchdown winning a state people celebrated with as much fanfare or disappointment as anything the NFL could provide PERIOD



There were other significant races across the country last night PERIOD For the first time in our nations history a first lady won a major elected seat  in a state she has never resided in prior to seeking office PERIOD The Republicans maintained control of Congress  dashing the hopes of the Democrats who invested heavily in key races across the nation PERIOD In Oklahoma the heated second district race for the vacated Congressional seat by Tom Coburn was reclaimed by a Democrat PERIOD



When the race finally ends the nation can take a deep breath PERIOD However political analysts will undoubtedly be attempting to understand Election  for many years to come PERIOD



This was a historic year and we want to remind you of the important part your votes played in the election PERIOD After all these were the peoples decisions PERIOD
