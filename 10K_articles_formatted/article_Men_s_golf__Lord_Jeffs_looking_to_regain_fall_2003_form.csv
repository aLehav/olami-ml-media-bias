8155,2004-09-03,"when the fall season drew to a close the Jeffs looked poised to overtake perennial golf stalwart Williams College PERIOD At the NESCAC Championships played at Williams own Taconic Golf Club the Jeffs defeated the Ephs by a sound sixstroke margin falling by a single shot to Hamilton College and NESCAC player of the year Brian Williams a transfer from Ohio State University PERIOD All five Jeffs shot  or better all five earned First or SecondTeam AllNESCAC honors PERIOD

But the flashes of brilliance were just that flashes PERIOD David Litt  and Sean Jules  revelations in the fall never got into a groove in the spring leaving captain Justin Sharaf  to shoulder the load PERIOD

Sharaf performed admirably under the strain of being Amhersts only consistent golferafter winning his first collegiate tournament the Skidmore College Palamountain Invitational with a  he was named a  Cleveland Golf Div PERIOD III AllAmerica Scholar and a Golf Coaches Association of America GCAA Ping AllNortheast Region golferbut even he couldnt do it alone PERIOD

Williams didnt make Nationals for the first time in nine years but instead of Amherst it was Skidmore College St PERIOD Lawrence University and New York University that filled the void PERIOD

For better or worse the  Amherst squad was a young team PERIOD The Jeffs lost just one senior to graduation PERIOD The  incarnation is a stable one PERIOD The roster is set to the point that three firstyears are expected to compete for one open spot on the team PERIOD Unlike last fall the leaves changing will not herald a changing of the guard PERIOD

The old guardSharaf Litt and to a lesser extent Juleswill be complemented by Mike Valentine  Drew Russ  and Andy Bruns  PERIOD

Not unlike many other tall golfers the  Valentine has battled with his swing mechanics but when his game is right he is capable of posting scores in the 70s as he did at NESCACs PERIOD

Russ meanwhile had scheduling conflicts throughout the spring and never solidified a spot as several teammates expected he would PERIOD

And Bruns who struggled in making the adjustment to college golf his college scores not approaching his high school ones may have turned the corner at the seasonending Little Threes where he teamed with junior Keith Zalaski to demolish Wesleyan University and edge Williams in alternateshot match play and then beat Wesleyan and halved his match against Williams in afternoon singles play PERIOD

Said Bruns I feel more comfortable with my surroundings this year than last year and Im looking forward to competing for the five spots with the new guys and with the returning golfers.At the same time since were so deep you may not even see the same lineup twice. amherst begins competition next week at the Skidmore Invitational PERIOD Williams and of course Skidmore will be there making this a good earlyseason test for the Jeffs and an even better one for their brash captain who said he sees no reason why he cant win a second tournament at Skidmore and the Jeffs cant win the tournament as a team for the first time PERIOD",Men's golf: Lord Jeffs looking to regain fall 2003 form,Amherst College
