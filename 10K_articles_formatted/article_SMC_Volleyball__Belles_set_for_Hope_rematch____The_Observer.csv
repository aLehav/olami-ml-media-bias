Hope swept Saint Marys    Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Head coach Julie SchroederBiek said she hopes her team will show the same drive against Hope that it did Tuesday over Adrian which one month earlier beat Saint Marys    PERIOD

In our win against Adrian we really brought our game to the next level SchroederBiek said.The intensity and drive to win was amazing PERIOD We now only carry the confidence gained from that win along with the momentum into our Hope match. hope which ranks third in the MIAA standings has a strong defense that will test the Belles often PERIOD

Hope has a strong outside attack and they have great hustle on defense SchroederBiek said PERIOD These will be the big threats to watch for in facing them. the Belles will look to eliminate the unforced errors that have plagued them in their last three matches PERIOD They average nine services errors per game during that span PERIOD

Consistent serving is our biggest weakness SchroederBiek said PERIOD We are definitely working on our focus when it comes to serves. against Hope SchroederBiek does not plan to make changes in the lineup that took down Adrian PERIOD

We have been bordering on this type of play all season she said.The mental game has been our battle from the beginning PERIOD We are making huge strides in mastering it and we cant let up now  just keep working at being a great team. the Belles are  in league play and  overall while Hope is  in the MIAA and  overall PERIOD The teams will face off tonight at  at the Angela Athletic Facility PERIOD
