4158,2007-11-16,"after having the fortune of starting their season in the familiarity of home the UCSB womens basketball team opens up their first weekend on the road with a tough schedule PERIOD

The Gauchos  overall have already played a pair of games in the Thunderdome but their first road match comes against their first ranked opponent  Arizona State PERIOD The Sun Devils have yet to win a game but theyve had quite an early season schedule with matches against North Carolina and both the United States and Chinese national teams PERIOD The teams have squared off seven times previously with the Gauchos leading the series  PERIOD Their last meeting was in the  ASU Holiday Classic finals which Santa Barbara won PERIOD However the Sun Devils have improved a lot since then and return  players from last years Elite  squad PERIOD

Expected to make her debut for the season for Santa Barbara is star center Jenna Green who has missed the early portion of the season with a back injury PERIOD The senior led the Gauchos last year in most statistical categories en route to being named the teams MVP PERIOD Last year she became the twenty-first Gaucho to score more than  points and she now sits seventeenth on the schools alltime scoring list PERIOD She is only  points away from passing up Kira Anthofer  for the sixteenth spot PERIOD Green is a spiritual leader of the team as well and having her back and healthy is a huge boost for the rest of the Gaucho squad PERIOD

Green will hopefully help Santa Barbara in the one area that has plagued them in the early season shooting PERIOD UCSB lost their opener to Brigham Young University and barely hung on for a  overtime win against USC despite a very solid stat sheet PERIOD However the Gauchos averaged only . percent shooting for the two matches which is considerably less than Santa Barbara would like PERIOD

On the flip side the Santa Barbara defense has been solid so far PERIOD With . rebounds and  steals per game the Gauchos have been very tough to run up points on PERIOD In last weeks win against USC UCSB held on solely by their defensive play until a late scoring run put the game into overtime PERIOD With a  turnover margin the Gauchos have been able to create a lot of extra chances to make up for their lackluster shooting PERIOD
