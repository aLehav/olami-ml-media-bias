In her first fulllength recorded album released in four years titled Here Keys pushes the boundaries of composition conveying her passion for social and political activism with a resilient voice and adventurous musicality PERIOD

The album represents Keys as well as a community from the top to the bottom PERIOD Keys presses down on sensitive topics including drug addiction selfesteem the environment and the divisions of discrimination PERIOD Keys refuses to forget where she came from PERIOD She reveals that there is strength and pride in her heritage PERIOD Fans remember previous albums that introduced the world to a relatable girl from New York City who pours her soul into her music and the keyboard PERIOD Piano is brightly featured on this album as well as could be expected PERIOD In the song The Gospel solo piano carries the listener in with a beautiful harmonic sound that is joined with a marching style beat choral mantras and rap vocals from the woman herself PERIOD For a moment the listener can actually picture themselves in the shoes of an NYC family struggling just to get by PERIOD

Im telling you like it is How we ever gone live if we aint getting money how we feedin the kids Keys raps in the most authentic mode PERIOD

Other songs such as Pawn it all continue this raw depiction of urban experience PERIOD This song similar to Beyoncs  release Lemonade draws from the influence of the roots of slave hymn gospel and Motown jazz PERIOD Keys takes the listener to church in this one chanting at the end get on up. other pieces of the album feature acoustic guitar in place of keys PERIOD Songs like Kill Your Mama which is a message about the environment PERIOD Mama is analogized from poetry about Black mothers in the interlude that precedes to Mother Earth PERIOD

Shame on us on your sons and your daughters dig all your gold and we poisoned all your waters  Trying to play God  People Fing with genetics  all that you have given and we only disrespect it  how you gonna kill your mama  when only mama is gonna love you to the grave Keys sings unapologetically PERIOD

Many have followed Keys current no makeup movement in the media PERIOD After she chose to make a statement by no longer wearing makeup in big photo shoots to award shows like the VMAs and to perform at the Democratic National Convention PERIOD The message has slowly begun to sink in PERIOD She describes the movement on the Today Show as a metaphor for finding yourself. in Here she expresses her position on the issue in the song Girl Cant Be Herself. to a reggae style rhythm and melody Keys sings Who says I must conceal what I am made of  Maybe all this Maybelline is covering my selfesteem. keys is an amazing storyteller PERIOD Instead of singing about someone she sings from that persons own perspective PERIOD With her voice the listener could be left convinced that what Keys is illustrating is real to her PERIOD In the song Illusion of Bliss she tells a story from the point of view of a 29yearold drug addict PERIOD The lyrics describe this state as a bottomless kiss an illusion of bliss. this song is one of the most powerful PERIOD Keys puts into the music that addiction as an illness as someone who needs help and is tired of being judged PERIOD The singer belts to the top of her range and back as if she is really dying to be heard PERIOD

She ties together the album with Holy War a declaration of love over war PERIOD Its an expression of faith in humanity as well as an urgent plea for change PERIOD She conveys that society is divided by sexuality and skin and through the music uplifts and encourages as well as illuminates the issues PERIOD

All in all Keys has not changed her sound so much as she has changed what she is saying through her music PERIOD
