by  Julianna Landis Published  February  

The Gophers secured a win and a tie in a twogame series against Notre Dame over the weekend PERIOD Minnesota now sits at first place in the Big Ten conference standings tied with Penn State at  points PERIOD With four games left in the season the Gophers are set to face the Nittany Lions on the road next weekend PERIOD

Gophers grab extra point in shootout

Minnesotas first game of the weekend officially ended in a  tie but the Gophers took Notre Dame all the way to a shootout to secure an extra Big Ten conference point PERIOD

The Gophers needed only one round of the shootout to end it with Brannon McManus scoring before goaltender Jack LaFontaine made the save at the other end of the ice PERIOD

Minnesota got to work early in the game with Scott Reedy scoring less than  seconds after the puck dropped PERIOD He was assisted by his linemates Blake McLaughlin and Sammy Walker PERIOD

The trio combined again later in the period to build the Gophers lead PERIOD McLaughlin got the goal the second time around but Notre Dame was able to respond just minutes later with Colin Theisen getting the Fighting Irish on the board PERIOD

After getting one past LaFontaine in the opening period Notre Dame scored two more in the second PERIOD Nick Leivermann tied the game  early on and Notre Dame gained a lead on the Gophers while on the powerplay later in the period PERIOD

In the third period Walker scored off a deflection assisted by Garrett Wait and Matt Staudacher to tie the game once more and stopping a run of three consecutive Notre Dame goals PERIOD

Success in the shootout was something of a second chance for the Gophers PERIOD In the second overtime period they had a chance to end it when Reedy was awarded a penalty shot after Notre Dames Nate Clurman was called for interference but he went wide on the chance and missed PERIOD

Minnesota picks up a win on Saturday 

The Gophers picked up a pair of third period goals rallying from a deficit to edge out the Fighting Irish PERIOD

McManus was the catalyst for both goals forcing a turnover and getting the assist on Ben Meyers tying goal three minutes into the period PERIOD Minutes later McManus again set up a goal getting the primary assist on McLaughlins gamewinner PERIOD

I like how were playing hockey head coach Bob Motzko told Gopher Sports PERIOD We came back this weekend and play a really good weekend thats what we want to continue to build on. minnesota started off Saturdays game in impressive fashion allowing just one Notre Dame shot on goal through the first twenty minutes of play PERIOD They made  shots of their own but were unable to get one in the back of the net PERIOD Minnesotas offense fell off in the second generating just five shots while Notre Dame was able to find the back of the net PERIOD

Despite the goal Minnesota limited Notre Dames offense throughout PERIOD LaFontaine finished with  saves PERIOD
