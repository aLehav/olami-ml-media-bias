484,2023-10-23,"professors are truly the best PERIOD Their jobs are demanding timeconsuming and overwhelming PERIOD These educated individuals help shape the future of our generation by teaching and guiding students into adulthood PERIOD We owe so much to these people PERIOD

What we as students sometimes forget is that professors are just like us human beings with personal lives and personalities PERIOD Each one is different and teach in different ways PERIOD It is entertaining to see how each professor will show their personality as the semester stretches on PERIOD

Students know that no two professors are the same PERIOD However sometimes we tend to put them in personality groups. let me show you what I mean PERIOD

We all know it is a professors job to assign projects readings and homework PERIOD It helps students gain practice and more of an understanding of the material PERIOD

However this type of professor finds it hard to stop assigning material especially over days off PERIOD This Grinch steals holidays with their assignments and packets PERIOD Breaks Holidays Special Events What are those to this professor When Fall break or Thanksgiving come around homework does not get done by the students PERIOD

Its called a break for a reason PERIOD Family events vacations friends and family take first priority during these times PERIOD This professor has a hard time understanding that their students have personal lives outside of college PERIOD No matter what the holiday it is or what event has occurred homework is always assigned by this professor during those breaks PERIOD It is like they never let school leave us alone even for just one day PERIOD

This is secretly every students favorite professor because they always make us smile PERIOD All of their power points and lectures are filled with memes jokes vines or hilarious YouTube videos PERIOD You cannot go to their class and not laugh PERIOD

The Comedian understands that college is hard for both the students and the professor and they try to make the best of it PERIOD The class is entertaining in every single way because the professor jokes constantly to get the class off topic and laughter never leaves the room PERIOD

Homework is never difficult in this class because due to how memorable each and every lecture is one has a hard time forgetting the material PERIOD These professors are still young students at heart and they seem to relate to the students on a personal level PERIOD

Weve all had that professor that constantly shows videos assigns readings during class and shows simple boring power points that consume the entire hour and a half of class PERIOD

The Walking Dead professors hardly ever talk and when they actually do their voice is nondynamic and monotone PERIOD Its obvious that they dont want to be there as much as the students PERIOD Sitting in that small college desk seems completely pointless because everything being shown in class can be easily watched and read at home PERIOD I often wonder if The Walking Dead professors either need another cup of coffee a funny joke to get them to crack a smile or a hug PERIOD

Picture this with me PERIOD Its just another day in the classroom PERIOD Then suddenly as class is excused for the day the professor says Oh Dont forget about your sixpage essay on chapter five due tomorrow. the whole class freezes in place PERIOD Wait what

Sound familiar This professor doesnt understand how young adults minds work PERIOD Our capacity to hold information for a certain amount of time is small due to how much college demands and how much caffeine we consume PERIOD

As a result reminders alarms planners and canvas notifications are our favorite thing PERIOD We love reminders and frankly need them PERIOD Not the day before though PERIOD Those are what we call stress surprises which are like an evil clown jumping out from a little toy box PERIOD

A note to professors please take pity on college students lack of organization and our overloaded schedules PERIOD Give us a fair warning for an assignment PERIOD We will do it trust us but we need a reminder or two about the due date PERIOD

 PERIOD The Brutal Oprah

You get an F and you get an F and you get an F

Cue late night meltdown PERIOD Forget Oprah giving out free cars PERIOD This professor gives Fs proudly PERIOD

Oh how these professors hate us or so it seems PERIOD Their red pen markings all over our tests seem to screams Who cares if my work is too hard and the classes average is below a C PERIOD I will destroy you all. no matter how hard you try no matter how much you read the textbook no matter how much effort you put into trying to retain every single detail they say in the lecture absolutely nothing helps your grade PERIOD

The Brutal Oprah is the hardest of graders the cruelest test giver and loves to hear students moan at the sight of a pop quiz PERIOD Students always question their will to live in this professors classroom PERIOD

The Brutal Oprah certainly expects a lot from their class and in some ways thats a good thing PERIOD Every student needs a push to become better PERIOD But when every students quizzes and tests are below a B maybe some extra credit options would be wise to add to the curriculum PERIOD

We love our professors PERIOD They help each and every student become the best they can possibly become PERIOD Not all professors are the same but some of them certainly know how to leave a lasting impression PERIOD No matter if your professor is a Brutal Oprah or the Comedian they all deserve our respect and admiration PERIOD So to the professors everywhere thank you for all you do PERIOD And to the students keep chugging that coffee and stretching for good grades PERIOD The semester is almost over PERIOD
