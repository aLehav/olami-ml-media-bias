One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

Tim Miles strolled to the podium in Chicago sat down and smiled PERIOD As the firstyear coach of Nebraska this was his first Big Ten Media Day but Miles didnt show it PERIOD He cracked jokes poked fun and ended his press conference with a panoramic photo of the media in the room that then went out to his large Twitter following PERIOD

Miles is the new man in charge of a Nebraska team that won just four conference games and finished dead last in the Big Ten last year but he looked like a coach that was more than comfortable in Chicago PERIOD

Lost in all the hoopla was that Miles is actually a pretty darn good basketball coach PERIOD He was hired away from Colorado State where he had been since  PERIOD In his first season in Colorado the team won seven games PERIOD In his last season in Colorado the team won  games and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

Not just a personality Miles is slowly pulling Nebraska  Big Ten  overall out of the cellar PERIOD It took the Cornhuskers until January  last year to reach nine wins  this year they reached nine wins in late December and last week they barely lost to Wisconsin PERIOD

Nebraska travels to Ann Arbor tonight for its biggest test of the season No PERIOD  Michigan   PERIOD
