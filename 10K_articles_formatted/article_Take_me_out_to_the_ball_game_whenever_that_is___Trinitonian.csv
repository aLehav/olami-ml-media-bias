March  

Ren Rader

Oh November please come back PERIOD The World Series this past season left us all hopeful PERIOD An Atlanta team hadnt choked Shohei Ohtani won MVP All was right with the world and baseball was ready for another quiet peaceful offseason PERIOD This slumber lasted all of  calendar days before it was shattered PERIOD At  a.m PERIOD on Dec PERIOD  MLB officially went into a Lockout  the first since  PERIOD

Rumblings of a possible lockout had been ongoing for the last two seasons but the sudden truth of the situation was as abrupt as it was avoidable PERIOD The  lockout is already the longest in baseball history and has led to a delayed spring training schedule in Arizona and Florida PERIOD There are severe doubts that the regular season will start on time with Opening Day currently scheduled for March  PERIOD

In short a lockout results from a labor dispute between the players and team owners of the MLB PERIOD This particular labor dispute has been especially nasty with accusations and conspiracy theories flying left and right a lack of compromise and a frustrating lack of progress towards a new deal overall PERIOD

The primary cause of this dispute is the Collective Bargaining Agreement or CBA PERIOD A CBA is a contract between the owners of the league and the Players Union PERIOD The agreement is massive in the individual leagues because it forms the rules regarding how players are employed PERIOD At the end of the day no matter how high we place them athletes are still employees of the organization PERIOD However the biggest and most contentious part of the CBA is money PERIOD The CBA decides crucial things like how player salaries will be determined how much a team can pay their players and rules regarding items such as free agency PERIOD

Typically there are not many issues regarding new CBAs PERIOD The MLB and MLBPA sign or are supposed to sign a new agreement every five years and it has run smoothly for the better part of  years PERIOD During such conflicts there are typically three options for the owners The first is a Lockout where players are barred from team facilities PERIOD The second is temporarily using the old CBA while negotiations continue PERIOD Or the third where the owners use the old CBA but the players go on strike PERIOD

Negotiations started as early as August of last year but were quickly shut down due to issues stemming back to the pandemic season PERIOD After initially deciding on a  length schedule for  pay for players the team owners requested to alter the deal to reduce player pay PERIOD Despite playing their games the league argued that teams would lose millions of dollars of revenue for paying players PERIOD However since the  CBA owners have earned more revenue than ever before while the average MLB player salary has declined in recent years PERIOD Though they are the best in the world most players over  have a salary of less than  million PERIOD Despite these drops overall team revenue has tripled since  PERIOD Essentially the league is making more money but the players are not PERIOD

Another point of contention for the players has been the frankly awful free agency rules that have plagued the league for years PERIOD When a player is drafted they are forced to stay with the team for seven years  by far the longest among the major American sports PERIOD While this may be a good thing for teams to evaluate their young players through what is undoubtedly the most advanced minor league system in sports players hate it PERIOD Holding a player in a team for seven years means that they cannot leave in free agency restricting them from making more money early on in their careers PERIOD While it is true that the most significant MLB contracts are far greater than any other American athlete not named Patrick Mahomes See Mike Trout these are few and far between PERIOD The Players Union wants their young players to be paid more and paid earlier PERIOD

These points of contention have led owners to make some pretty severe threats with some offering to place a hard cap on the minor league staff PERIOD One proposal limited minor league staff from  players down to  PERIOD While this might not seem like a big deal this could eliminate around  minor league careers before theyve even begun PERIOD The owners claim this is a costsaving measure PERIOD However cost is the least of their concerns at the moment thanks to record revenue every year until  PERIOD

This footdragging by the owners has led the players into an almost open revolt with many targeting Commissioner Rob Manfred PERIOD Multiple players have ripped into the commissioner since  with some being downright insulting PERIOD Current Yankees pitcher Jameson Taillon called the negotiations slimy tonedeaf greedy lying and overall out of touch in a tweet in July Travis Shaw a current Free Agent said that the MLB should be embarrassed by the stoppage PERIOD

Players argued that the owners deliberately tried to change the contract to stall negotiations furtherleading to a shortened season PERIOD This claim led to a  million grievance filed by the players association which is still pending PERIOD These arguments by the players mirror statements made by players against the League back in  when they accused owners of conspiring with each other in free agency to limit the amount that bigname players could make PERIOD While these claims could be based in fact some of them are pretty out thereand if theyre true they could be devastating for the MLBs reputation PERIOD

Already the MLB can see the effects of the lockout PERIOD Players have stopped being tested for performanceenhancing drugs PEDs for the first time since  spring training has already been delayed and the season is at serious risk for an ontime start of March  PERIOD

On Dec PERIOD  less than  hours from the beginning of the lockout the MLBPA and owners met in Dallas in one lastditch effort to avoid a lockout PERIOD The negotiations lasted ten minutes PERIOD The sides met again in January  first on the  and then backtoback on the  and  PERIOD On Jan PERIOD  negotiations went nowhere but the big news of the talk on Jan PERIOD  and  was that they didnt go backward PERIOD The twohour discussion on the  and the hourlong talk on the  were the longest the two sides had talked since the lockout PERIOD

The League asked for Federal Mediation on Feb PERIOD  hoping for the government to step in to tell both sides what to do PERIOD The Union denied the mediation request a day later PERIOD Progress was dead again PERIOD The Feb PERIOD  meeting lasted just  minutes and all hopes of continuation were dead in the water PERIOD As of March  negotiations are currently ongoing but recent proposals from the Union and owners have both been shut down PERIOD

No one is willing to back down and the deadline to cancel games has passed PERIOD Multiple sources say that games will be canceled and the owners were far more hostile during meetings on the  PERIOD The owners announced they were willing to miss over a month of the season and the players turned down their most recent offer PERIOD The question has shifted from if the season will be delayed to how far the season will be delayed PERIOD In this battle of rich young athletes vs rich old owners neither side is backing down PERIOD

Who knows maybe by the time this is published all of what Ive written will be a funny memory with both sides agreeing to a lastminute deal PERIOD Perhaps both sides will have decided this argument is stupid and should just compromise PERIOD Maybe well get a season PERIOD I wouldnt bet on it but just Maybe PERIOD
