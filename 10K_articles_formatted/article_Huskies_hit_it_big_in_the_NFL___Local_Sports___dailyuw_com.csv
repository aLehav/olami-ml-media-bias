This may come as a surprise to some but even after four probably five consecutive losing seasons the Huskies still have  players in the NFL PERIOD

Heres a look at a few of the more notable ones

Jerramy Stevens Since doing his best to lose Super Bowl XL all by himself Stevens has moved on to bigger and better things and is now attempting to revive his career in Tampa Bay following a pesky DUI charge PERIOD

A  presumably  sober Stevens caught five passes against the Bears two weeks ago then got shut down by the Packers on Sunday PERIOD Interestingly enough the number of passes he has caught this year  five  is lower than the number of crimes hes been charged with PERIOD

Damon Huard Somehow Huard is still in the NFL while younger brother Brock  a recordsetter in his time at the UW  is doing color commentary for FSN and ESPN PERIOD I cant decide whether to be more excited for Huard who went undrafted out of college yet is still in the NFL at  or for Brock who doesnt have to play for the Chiefs PERIOD It could go either way PERIOD

Tank Johnson Ol Tank only has two tackles this year but something tells me hes going to end up being quite the .. PERIOD weapon for the Cowboys before the seasons over PERIOD That was a gun joke PERIOD Anyway Dallas acquisition of Adam  Jones during the offseason means that Tank is no longer the biggest Roger Goodell enemy on the team which is a plus PERIOD

And in what could be interpreted as a gesture of solidarity and loyalty toward his alma mater Tank has yet to record a sack this season PERIOD

Lawyer Milloy Remember when the Huskies had guys like this in the secondary Yeah me neither PERIOD Milloys career is winding down serving as another sad reminder that the glory days of bighitting UW defenses are very much in the past PERIOD Hes still somewhat productive for the Falcons and even has an interception this year PERIOD Heres to the good old days Dawg fans PERIOD

Mark Brunell Yes Brunell is still in the league PERIOD The Saints roster says so PERIOD But he hasnt played this year possibly due to the fact that you cant play football with a walker PERIOD Just retire Mark PERIOD

Isaiah Stanback Hes got two catches for  yards this season with the Cowboys but I bring him up because the last time he took the field as a quarterback the Huskies were above . pERIOD Keep that one in the back of your brain somewhere because thats a trivia question waiting to happen PERIOD

Omare Lowe Reggie Williams and Khalif Barnes They all play for Jacksonville and Reggie just eclipsed the 2000yard mark for career receiving yards PERIOD If he could play against Marcus Trufant every weekend hed probably have a lot more PERIOD

Meanwhile Louis Rankin Marcel Reece and Greyson Gunheim are all getting broken in on Oaklands practice squad this year and Marques Tuiasosopo is the Raiders thirdstring quarterback PERIOD Which means that Marques and his brother Matt a Mariners farmhand who saw some time in the big leagues this year can argue over who plays for the most pathetic franchise PERIOD
