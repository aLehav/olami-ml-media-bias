Hope is a very dangerous thing. for decades fans of Cleveland sports have found Morgan Freemans words from The Shawshank Redemption to be all too true PERIOD Even casual sports fans are probably familiar with Clevelands level of despair no professional Cleveland team has won a championship since  and the idea that God Hates Cleveland is commonly accepted across the sports world PERIOD If thats true then something from the past few months has warmed Gods heart PERIOD Cleveland sports are on the rise and with the way the Browns are playing the return of LeBron James may not even be this years most notable sign from the heavens PERIOD

Two months ago as the NFL season was just beginning many figured the only way Cleveland would stay relevant was by starting Johnny Football Manziel its controversial and exciting firstround draft pick at quarterback PERIOD Instead Johnny Football has spent nearly the entire season on the bench and for the best possible reason  the Browns are winning PERIOD Led by Brian Hoyer Cleveland is  and owns possession of first place in the AFC North Division for the first time this late in the season since it was tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers back in November  PERIOD

With that said aside from a rock solid defense that held the highpowered Cincinnati Bengals offense to a measly three points in last Thursdays  Browns victory it may seem puzzling as to why Cleveland has started the season so well PERIOD For example ESPNs statistic measure for quarterbacks Total QBR lists Hoyer at twenty-second out of  measurable quarterbacks PERIOD On a scale where  is the best and  represents a league average quarterback Hoyers . rating is one of the most pedestrian measures in the league PERIOD Football Outsiders advanced metrics put Cleveland nineteenth in team efficiency right in between the  Atlanta Falcons and the  San Francisco 49ers PERIOD Even the stout defense is ranked twenty-first out of  teams yet Cleveland still finds ways to win PERIOD

Though it may not account for a large portion of advanced statistics Clevelands plusnine turnover margin says a great deal about how the Browns win games PERIOD Cleveland averages less than one giveaway per game but creates two turnovers per game PERIOD For a team that is twenty-sixth in time of possession and sixteenth in Football Outsiders offensive efficiency that extra possession per game is vital for Cleveland PERIOD

A relatively easy schedule also helps PERIOD Because the NFLs scheduling is in part based off the previous years performance the Browns  finish last season enabled them to play weaker teams like the Oakland Raiders and Buffalo Bills compared to their division rivals PERIOD A fivethirthyeight.com analysis saw Cleveland as having the seventheasiest schedule in the league and with games against Houston and Atlanta on the horizon there is a very likely scenario that Cleveland could have seven or eight wins under its belt by Thanksgiving making it a prime contender for a playoff spot in the AFC PERIOD

While the Browns are more of a surprise Cinderella story the return of LeBron James has farreaching impacts beyond the Quicken Loans Arena court PERIOD July estimates made by Bloomberg put the value of LeBrons return to be  million per year for the city PERIOD Though the Cavaliers franchise is the largest beneficiary there is still good reason to believe that downtown businesses will benefit as well PERIOD Season tickets for the Cavs sold out within hours of LeBrons announcement and nightly attendance is expected to be consistently around  compared to an average of  people last year PERIOD The renewed influx of fans in an increasingly vibrant downtown will help Cleveland businesses that are dependent on tourism and live events maintain and create jobs even if some of the spending that is now going toward basketball comes at the expense of other entertainment or nightlife alternatives PERIOD

Despite a  start which can largely be attributed to growing pains and a lack of ingame chemistry the Cavs will almost certainly compete for a top seed in the Eastern Conference PERIOD The arrival of allstar power forward Kevin Love from Minnesota and the continued growth of point guard Kyrie Irving could mean a newer and younger edition of the Big Three that LeBron formed in Miami with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh PERIOD Though LeBron only signed a twoyear contract he should have plenty of time to forge the necessary bonds with Irving and Love to put Cleveland in the championship conversation PERIOD

It almost seems strange to be discussing the justified optimism of a city that is referred to by detractors as The Mistake by the Lake PERIOD Naturally Cleveland fans are probably wary to hope theyve indulged before only to be burned PERIOD Yes hope can be a very dangerous thing but for Cleveland in  it might just be a worthwhile endeavor PERIOD
