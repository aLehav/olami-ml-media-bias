Summer is winding down meaning that the time for fall sports is just around the corner PERIOD One team to keep your eyes on this upcoming season is the womens volleyball team as Grand Valley States Frankie Cavallaro is one of the two seniors who will be leading her team this year PERIOD

Last season the team had a conference record of  and an overall record of  PERIOD This season Cavallaro is determined to make her team more successful PERIOD Whether it is simply winning while at home or making it into the NCAA tournament the senior has high hopes for where her team is heading PERIOD

One thing that I want to focus on is winning all of our home games Cavallaro said PERIOD Its something that we take pride in at our home gym we should win every time there PERIOD I also would say another goal of mine is to make it to the GLIAC tournament finals this year and making it to the NCAA tournament PERIOD We havent made it into the NCAA tournament in three years and it would be a really big accomplishment to bring us back into that standard. winning is not the only thing that is on Cavallaros mind this season PERIOD Being that there are only two seniors and no juniors the team is faced with an influx of underclassmen who are looking to her and fellow senior Kendall Yerkes for leadership PERIOD There is bound to be hardship and growth within this upcoming season PERIOD

This year is different for us Cavallaro said PERIOD We have a very different dynamic now with two upperclassmen and sixteen lowerclassmen that is something that we will have to work through PERIOD It will be interesting to see who steps up from the lower classmen PERIOD Creating a culture and a good environment will be something that Kendall and I focus on we also want to do well with setting examples and holding each other accountable this season. with this being her senior season here at GVSU Cavallaro took a look at the reasons why she chose to become a Laker PERIOD

Volleyball was obviously a big part of my decision but it was the campus that did it for me Cavallaro said PERIOD I fell in love with it immediately the buildings were beautiful and the campus had a community of its own PERIOD It was also a good distance from home my parents can come visit and see my games and I can come home to visit as well without it being too close PERIOD Most of all what attracted me was the tradition of excellence in the sports department PERIOD I like to see not only the volleyball team but other teams who do well as well PERIOD Its good to be around other successful teams. going into her fourth year playing collegiate volleyball Cavallaro has learned a thing or two about what it takes to be a successful student athlete and shared some of her advice PERIOD

To work hard for the people around you I think some athletes get caught up in wanting themselves to succeed and in volleyball you cannot succeed without others Cavallaro said PERIOD I also think that if you are the hardest worker in the gym your teammates will see and want to work harder too which creates a better environment and culture for the team PERIOD Also do not take everything so seriously if you work hard everyday and your team is giving their all that is what matters at the end of the day. oct
