United States Representative Steve Scalise speaks about coronavirus on Tuesday July   during the press conference with Vice President Mike Pence and other local officials at Tiger Stadium PERIOD

On March  the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act CARES was passed into law to provide economic relief for American families during the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD

The CARES Act was created to provide financial assistance to many different areas of societal infrastructure including universities across the country PERIOD LSU received . million to distribute among its students PERIOD Distribution was based on the students  Free Application for Federal Student Aid which was based on tax information from  PERIOD

Is this really fair Everyone was financially impacted by the pandemic PERIOD Many college students did not qualify for stimulus checks because they were still listed as dependents on their parents taxes PERIOD Some were also unable to receive unemployment checks because they did not meet the requirements PERIOD If the CARES Act was the only aid the government could hand out why was it so unfairly distributed

Personally I received  PERIOD I know some students who did not receive a dime and others who received nearly  PERIOD Im not saying the aid was insufficient for some students PERIOD It simply isnt fair to base distribution on tax forms from  during a pandemic taking place in  PERIOD

To put this situation in context lets say my family was considered a highincome family in  but both my parents lost their jobs due to the pandemic PERIOD I would probably not be eligible for CARES Act aid because of my previous highincome status from  PERIOD

I might have been rich then but a lot changes in three years PERIOD The government should have taken this into account and released a form for students to fill out with their updated financial information PERIOD

The CARES Act was a onetime supplement of aid for students but theres always more that could be done more leniency the University could provide its students PERIOD Why do universities feel like they are doing enough when most are doing less than the bare minimum right now

Universities are not making tuition and fees feasible during the economic disarray the pandemic has caused PERIOD They arent providing enough emotional support for students PERIOD Releasing statements on campus safety and dispersing CARES Act funds is the bare minimum when there is so much more the University could be doing to support its community PERIOD

College students are a part of a financially challenged demographic in America PERIOD Tuition rates are skyhigh and on top of work and school we now have to deal with the stress of living through a pandemic PERIOD

But does the administration care Did the legislators who wrote and passed the CARES act care Clearly not enough PERIOD
