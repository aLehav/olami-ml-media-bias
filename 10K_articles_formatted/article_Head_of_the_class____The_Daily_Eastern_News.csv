Eastern is doing something right with its teaching school PERIOD Ninetyseven percent of Eastern students who graduated in the  school year wanting to be teachers passed their teacher certification exams PERIOD

Of the  Eastern teacher education graduates who completed the exams  passed PERIOD

Many schools looking for qualified teachers turn to Eastern graduates PERIOD The test scores show Eastern students are capable and highly qualified PERIOD Its to Easterns credit that so many students passed the exams and became teachers PERIOD

Hundreds of communities across the state have hired Easterns graduates to teach said Liz Hitch dean of the College of Education and Professional Studies PERIOD They know from the classroom results that they see that Eastern has provided the kind of program graduates needed in order to be exemplary teachers. eastern is the second largest producer of teachers in the state PERIOD Of the six primary state universities in Illinois Eastern is second only to Illinois State University which has about  more students PERIOD

Its not surprising that Eastern students did well on their tests and are in demand in the workforce PERIOD Eastern has a history of being known as a topnotch teachers school PERIOD When the university was originally founded as Eastern Illinois State Normal School it was a teachers college PERIOD

Even today more than half of Easterns students are in the education program PERIOD The university also has numerous programs for teachers PERIOD The Minority Teacher Identification and Enrichment Project has established and maintained a statewide network of Minority Teacher Education Associations working at the community colleges and their feeder schools and high schools PERIOD

A new teacher mentoring and induction program was established to make sure Eastern graduates are well prepared PERIOD Also to increase the accessibility to teacher education programs and courses a collaborative effort between Eastern Illinois University and Illinois State University was started PERIOD

With all of the problems that seem to surround Eastern and all the complaints people have it is good to see such a high percentage of students are doing well PERIOD People should not be ashamed to attend this university they should not be scared away by the construction and the fact that the university has been promising a food court for so long PERIOD

Years from now it wont matter where you ate PERIOD When students go out to get a job employers are going to look at the academic values of their candidates PERIOD Eastern has proved it does a good job and the education department should be commended for its excellence in producing highcaliber students PERIOD
