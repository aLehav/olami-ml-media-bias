Women in this century are still not free from the shackles of stereotypes PERIOD From the time someone isa young girl they often hear about the motherhood they will inevitably pursue in years to come PERIOD These comments made in passing are fairly harmless and may not be made with ill intentions but theyre highly presumptuous PERIOD

The people this commentary is directed toward could very well be transgender face fertility issues or simply not want to have children PERIOD None of these things make them less of a woman or less worthy just as being a mother doesnt change someones value beauty or capability PERIOD

Motherhood is an amazing thing that many people look forward to in life PERIOD However for people who may not have the opportunity to fulfill their dreams of having children the journey to get there can be an absolute nightmare PERIOD Many women who wish to have children are unable to due to fertility or medical issues PERIOD According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about . million women in the United States have difficulty getting or staying pregnant PERIOD

Infertility can be very difficult for individuals seeking to get pregnant and they may feel ashamed or depressed because they cannot fulfill their motherly duty but in reality this is how they may have been conditioned to feel PERIOD When society continues to perpetuate the idea that womens primary purpose in the world is to bear children when they cannot or struggle to do so they are made to feel ostracized PERIOD That is the result of the idea that women are not valuable beyond the capability of their bodies PERIOD

For some prospective parents who cannot have children naturally adoption is sometimes a viable option but it is not possible for everyone PERIOD Due to the high costs and extensive background checks associated with fostering or adopting children not every person incapable of reproducing naturally is able to pursue this route PERIOD According to AdoptUsKids a national project that focuses on child welfare working with a private adoption can cost between  and  and working with a private attorney can range between  and  PERIOD Additionally it is very difficult to determine how long it will take to adopt a child PERIOD

Another difficulty mothers can face that is not acknowledged enough is postpartum depression PERIOD According to Mayo Clinic this condition is a longlasting form of depression that may arise following childbirth and includes symptoms such as sadness trouble sleeping and mood swings PERIOD The rhetoric surrounding postpartum depression is all too often that its the mothers fault PERIOD Mothers endure so much difficulty throughout pregnancy and after birth and we as a society must work to sympathize with this condition and support those who struggle with it rather than blaming or demonizing them PERIOD

From the opposite end women who do become mothers are not free from prejudice PERIOD Sometimes these people are objectified and experience sexualization from others PERIOD Other times mothers are almost regarded as disposable because theyve had their children and are done with what they need to do PERIOD Women do not exist only to mother children and to treat them as though they are is not only offensive but a reckless disregard for their humanity PERIOD

Additionally mothers who decide to return to the workplace after having a child may experience challenges PERIOD Many times working mothers are not treated with the same respect as their other coworkers and can be given low quality mommy track assignments or even be demoted for unfair reasons such as their superiors viewing them as incapable of completing heavier workloads PERIOD Working mothers and parents in general should be treated with respect and be given fair workloads PERIOD

Motherhood should not be the defining aspect of womens worth PERIOD Whether a woman can or cannot have children as well as whether they do or do not want to should be entirely their business PERIOD As a society we must strive to keep the conversation around motherhood inclusive and not to force women to feel they need to have children to have worth in the world PERIOD As well as this once a woman becomes a mother she deserves the same respect in personal relationships and the workplace PERIOD
