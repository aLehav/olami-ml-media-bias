UConn quarterback Marvin Washington scrambles away from a Bearcat defender during a game against Cincinnati on Sept PERIOD   PERIOD Nicholas Hampton The Daily Campus

The UConn Huskies fell to the Cincinnati Bearcats  Saturday afternoon dropping to  on the season and  in conference PERIOD

The Huskies offense came out of the gates strong and opened up the game with a 5play 75yard touchdown drive in under two minutes PERIOD They recorded three first downs on the first three plays before quarterback David Pindell found senior wide receiver Kyle Buss for a fiveyard score PERIOD

This was the first touchdown of Buss UConn career establishing him as one of Pindells top targets leading the team with  receiving yards through the first five games PERIOD

It felt good Buss said PERIOD Were up  so had a great drive to start the game and get down there and put the ball in the end zone PERIOD Doesnt get better than that. that would be all the offense for the entire game for UConn PERIOD They only came close to scoring again just once in the first half when towards the end of the second quarter Pindell completed a pass to senior tight end Aaron McLean along the side of the end zone PERIOD However the play was ruled incomplete on the field due to not being in bounds and even though it looked like McLean got a foot down the call stood after a review PERIOD The offense ended up stalling and the drive finished with a Michael Tarbutt missed 39yard field goal PERIOD

This would prove to be the turning point of the game PERIOD UConn was only down  at the time of the missed field goal with just  left in the half PERIOD Cincinnati proceeded to drive  yards down the field and score in just  seconds PERIOD

Multiple players after the game expressed how a missed field goal at a time like that really demoralizes the team including David Pindell PERIOD

Missing the field goal kind of killed us Pindell said PERIOD All of our players kind of seemed like they got down after that field goal miss. defensive back Tyler Coyle also chimed in PERIOD

When you miss the field goal all the energy on the team just deflated Coyle said PERIOD

What most likely could have been a  score heading into the half turned into  PERIOD

The Bearcats received the second half kickoff and wasted no time scoring a touchdown in just two plays and  seconds PERIOD They would go on to score three more touchdowns in the second half to complete their  run after UConns opening drive PERIOD

The Huskies only had two more red zone appearances the entire game PERIOD They squandered the first one when redshirt freshman Marvin Washington threw an interception at the 2yard line and then turned the ball over on downs the second time during the last minute of the game PERIOD

Coach Edsall addressed the disappearance of the offense following the opening possession PERIOD

They made an adjustment Edsall said PERIOD They put a different guy on Aaron McLean and then they went a little bit tighter coverage and we couldnt get off people. uConn put up  yards of total offense their second lowest mark of the season only ahead of the Boise State game PERIOD Running back Kevin Mensah rushed  times for just  yards his worst game this season and quarterback David Pindell only threw for  yards his second lowest mark PERIOD

Meanwhile the defense did their best to remain the worst in the entire country by giving up  yards of total offense to Cincy with  coming through the air and  on the ground PERIOD Somehow it bumped their average per game down from  to  PERIOD UConn who entered Sundays game last in Football Bowl Subdivision FBS by over  yards stayed put PERIOD The  points allowed was tied for the lowest amount this season with URI and lowered the average from . to . pERIOD

The Cincinnati offense had four different people rush for touchdowns including quarterbacks Desmond Rider and Hayden Moore PERIOD Running back Michael Warren II led the team with  yards on the ground and two touchdowns and Taylor Boose added  yards and a touchdown while only playing in the fourth quarter PERIOD

Cincinnati was  on third down conversions and  on fourth down as the Huskies struggled to find an answer for them all game PERIOD The one fourth down stop was the first for UConn all season PERIOD UConn on the other hand was just  on third down and  on fourth PERIOD

If one thing was certain from the postgame press conference it was that the game was on Edsall PERIOD He repeatedly took the blame saying thats on me or some variant at least six times PERIOD

Its all on me Edsall said to conclude the press conference PERIOD Its not on anybody else but me. next week UConn travels to Tennessee to take on the  Memphis Tigers who last year hung  points on the Huskies at home PERIOD With the defense taking a further step back this year viewers will likely experience some dj vu PERIOD
