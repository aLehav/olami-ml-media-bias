With live sports canceled nearly every sports fanatic tuned in to the  NFL Draft to catch a glimpse of some content PERIOD A completely virtual draft with NFL coaches general managers and the commissioner all stuck in their rather impressive homes the NFL draft went as smoothly as one could have hoped despite the looming possibility of a postponed season PERIOD

For those who do not know the draft is the process in which the top college athletes are selected by NFL teams PERIOD The order for each of the seven rounds is determined by the previous season records of the teams with the worst record receiving the first overall pick PERIOD Each pick just like a player is tradeable and can be used as capital to move up and down in the order PERIOD

Rookies are often more desirable than veterans because their contracts are considerably more teamfriendly than veteran deals due to NFL rules PERIOD While players can sign as undrafted rookies the best players will go in the first couple of rounds and a top draft pick often has a significant effect on a team in the following season PERIOD

There were winners and losers of the first round but for the most part there were few surprises PERIOD It was expected to be crazy unpredictable and filled with uncertainty but much of it went according to plan PERIOD A grand total of four trades occured on draft night only one of which happened in the top  PERIOD

Despite talks of the Lions Giants Cardinals and Jaguars all wanting to move down from their top  pick none of the excitement we were promised came to fruition and all of the teams picked the players they were expected to PERIOD

In football the quarterback holds an immense amount of positional value outranking any other individual position in importance PERIOD The quarterback is the only player that touches the ball in every play that hes on the field unless a trick play is called PERIOD

It was no surprise that three quarterbacks went in the top six picks Joe Burrow to the Bengals first Tua Tagovailoa to the Dolphins fifth and Justin Herbert to the Chargers sixth PERIOD

All three had tremendous collegiate careers PERIOD Burrow had statistically speaking the best single season in division  college athletics history and capped it off with a Heisman Trophy and National Championship for his alma mater Louisiana State University PERIOD This season made him the presumptive first pick  the Bengals even sent him a welcome gift before drafting him PERIOD Tagovailoa won his own national championship at the University of Alabama in  PERIOD Injury concerns made some wonder if he would be picked early but these proved unfounded PERIOD

A few teams that had the spotlight coming into the draft included the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots PERIOD After future Hall of Fame player and arguably greatest quarterback of all time Tom Brady decided to sign with the Bucs instead of the Patriots fans were rightfully curious to see what each teams next steps were PERIOD

The Bucs traded up from the fourteenth to the thirteenth pick to select offensive tackle Tristan Wirfs PERIOD This position is the most difficult and important in an offensive line responsible for keeping the quarterback safe and giving him time to make a play PERIOD A good offensive tackle is a must for a team with an immobile quarterback like Brady PERIOD The Patriots instead of potentially drafting Bradys replacement traded out of the first round to acquire more picks PERIOD

The biggest pick in the night came from the Green Bay Packers at pick  PERIOD With a very skilled quarterback Aaron Rodgers already at the helm many believed the Packers would select a wide receiver to help their star quarterback PERIOD But the Packers opted to move up from pick  to  and select Jordan Love  another quarterback PERIOD

This pick likely signals the end of the Rodgers era for the Green Bay Packers PERIOD Love will most likely sit for a couple years and be transitioned into the role of starter once Rodgers contract expires much like Rodgers did when he replaced Brett Favre PERIOD

A few other winners included the Cowboys D.C.s team and the Ravens PERIOD The Cowboys drafted arguably the best receiver in the draft CeeDee Lamb to add to their already stacked offensive arsenal PERIOD The team from D.C PERIOD selected the best talent in the draft defensive end Chase Young with the second overall pick PERIOD Predicted to be a perennial pro bowler and a once in a lifetime player Young is a game changer PERIOD Finally the Ravens waited patiently at pick  to have linebacker and projected top20 pick Patrick Queen fall into their lap and address their biggest need PERIOD

Despite some miscommunication over which analysts turn it was to talk over the Zoom call the virtual draft went off without a hitch PERIOD These first round players just earned themselves millions of dollars and will hopefully show teams that their investments are worth it in the next NFL season PERIOD The draft is when dreams come true for players and hope is restored for franchises and I know we all could use a bit of hope right now PERIOD",2020 NFL draft is unpredictably predictable - Campus Times,University of Rochester
