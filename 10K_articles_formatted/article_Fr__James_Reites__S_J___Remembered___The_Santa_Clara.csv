He had a very great love for the poor Bossou said PERIOD That is something we really cherish in the Society of Jesus. the trip to Benin was part of seniors Nico Metais and Jacob Leatherberrys culminating engineering design project PERIOD According to Metais Reites had a broader vision for his immersion trips hoping to return to various places and continue his work PERIOD Reites took Metais and Leatherberry to Benin to build a solar microgrid that would provide electricity to a small village PERIOD
Although you can use it to advance technology I think he really saw the possibility of technology to benefit the greater good Metais said PERIOD

We dont pretend to be able to replace him Hight said PERIOD What five different people do we find to fill his role
Students have keenly felt the loss of Reites PERIOD According to Leatherberry Reites was advising many senior design projects in the school of engineering PERIOD Many students feel at a loss and arent sure how to move forward without their mentor PERIOD
However Reites memory stays alive in many ways PERIOD Leatherberry said that one senior design team decided to name a bridge they are building in Ghana in his honor PERIOD Many other teams are trying to channel Reites spirit PERIOD
Our mission now is just to live his legacy Leatherberry said PERIOD
