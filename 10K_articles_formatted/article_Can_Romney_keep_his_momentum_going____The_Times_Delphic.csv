Mitt Romney is comfortably in first place for the Republican Presidential Nomination race PERIOD Having won over  delegates to the Republican National Convention Romney must capitalize on his campaign in the next month to come out victorious on Super Tuesday a win that would bring him even closer to the nomination PERIOD

Recently the media have focused on showcasing his mistakes such as his comment about the poor in Minnesota last week and his inability to connect with conservatives PERIOD Yet Romney has seemed to maintain the top spot in voter popularity PERIOD He won  percent of primary voters in New Hampshire  percent in Florida and  percent in Nevada just this past Saturday PERIOD Hes created momentum in his campaign but whether or not he will gain enough support to secure the nomination is still uncertain PERIOD

The media is in love with the idea that people dont like Romney Rachel Paine Caufield said PERIOD The big story right now is that Romney cant connect with voters but hes getting  percent of primary and caucus wins PERIOD I dont know how you really improve on that PERIOD Those are pretty strong results for him. caufield an associate professor of politics at Drake predicts Romney will receive the Republican presidential bid so long as he continues to campaign effectively PERIOD

Romneys best trait is that hes got this slow and steady attitude towards the race she said PERIOD Its a campaign of calculated risk and calculated reward PERIOD He hit his stride at about just the right time. caufield noted that Romney would need to maintain this momentum to receive the bid however PERIOD Politics and international relations professor Dennis Goldford said winning over conservatives would be Romneys biggest challenge PERIOD

Any particular ways he has altered his positions from what they used to be have been in a conservative direction Goldford said. romney is the guy your mom wants you to marry PERIOD Hes good looking has lots of money a great resume a great job but you dont love him and you dont trust him PERIOD Thats the way Republicans feel about Romney particularly conservatives. that lack of trust divides voters amongst the other candidates PERIOD This split of the votes between Santorum and Gingrich along with victories on Super Tuesday and in large delegate states is what Romney needs to maintain a successful campaign PERIOD

Romneys been playing a divide and conquer strategy Goldford said PERIOD Its in his interest for nobody to drop out just yet because it keeps fragmenting the field. caufield warned Democrats to keep an eye on Romney too PERIOD She said she sees many people taking the election for granted PERIOD

I think among Democrats theres this idea that Barack Obama is the same candidate that he was in  and that same energy and excitement can be generated easily she said PERIOD Mitt Romney is a formidable contender and anyone who isnt taking him seriously is making a mistake. despite an excellent strategy a wide base of supporters and several victories under his belt Romney is far from winning the race PERIOD Rick Santorum won the Minnesota Missouri and Colorado primaries Tuesday guaranteeing him over  delegates and moving him to second place and Newt Gingrich is expected to triumph in the south PERIOD The campaign season has been fickle and one wrong move could cost Romney the ticket PERIOD
