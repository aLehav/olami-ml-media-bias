After a lowscoring win over Marquette in Milwaukee last Saturday the No PERIOD  Wisconsin basketball team will travel back to Milwaukee to take on another instate rival UWMilwaukee on Wednesday night PERIOD

The Badgers  struggled offensively in their  win over the Golden Eagles shooting only . percent for the game and . percent from threepoint range PERIOD However UW held Marquette to just . percent shooting over the course of the game while turning the Golden Eagles  turnovers into  points PERIOD

But despite the grinditout win over an instate rival UW head coach Bo Ryan wasnt pleased with the Badgers  turnovers Saturday PERIOD

Even though  or  turnovers people would kill to have that number but to me I dont like it Ryan said PERIOD I like five six seven turnovers PERIOD Those are opportunities where we dont get a shot at the basket PERIOD It was selfinflicted. senior forward Frank Kaminsky led the Badgers with  points while senior guard chipped Josh Gasser in  points on four threepointers PERIOD Saturdays game was the second straight game where UW failed to have more than two players score in double figures PERIOD

Preseason allBig Ten selection Sam Dekker who is dealing with a lingering ankle injury that he suffered before the teams first exhibition game played just  minutes and went 1for5 from the field and scored only two points PERIOD Prior to the Marquette game Dekker was bothered again by the ankle injury and went just 2for5 against Duke last Wednesday while scoring five points PERIOD

However it appears Dekker is getting back to full strength as he did not miss either Mondays or Tuesdays practice PERIOD He is expected to play Wednesday against Milwaukee PERIOD

UWMilwaukee  has already lost three games to power conference opponents Auburn Oklahoma State and DePaul PERIOD Their most recent game came Monday against DePaul when they lost  PERIOD

The Panthers are led by senior guard Steve McWhorter who leads the team in points per game . assists per game . and is second on the team in rebounds hauling in . per game PERIOD No other player for Milwaukee averages double figure points PERIOD

Milwaukee is not only a familiar foe for the Badgers  the two teams will meet for the thirty-second time Wednesday with UW winning the last  meetings  but one that advanced to the NCAA Tournament last season after winning the Horizon League Tournament as a five seed PERIOD The Panthers are coached by Rob Jeter who has a long history with Ryan PERIOD

Jeter played under Ryan  who also was a head coach at UWMilwaukee  at UWPlatteville from  winning a national championship in  PERIOD Jeter was then an assistant coach with Ryan at Platteville UWMilwaukee and Wisconsin from  PERIOD

Ryan said he was impressed by the Panthers unlikely run to the NCAA Tournament last season PERIOD He considered it one of the best coaching jobs Jeter has ever done PERIOD

The way Milwaukee pulled off and came around last year and won that conference tournament and got into the NCAA Tournament showed me a lot Ryan said PERIOD I knew Jeter had some things in him PERIOD But last years run was probably his best ever considering what he was working with. wisconsin and Milwaukee will tipoff at  p.m PERIOD Wednesday night PERIOD The game will be televised on ESPN2 PERIOD
