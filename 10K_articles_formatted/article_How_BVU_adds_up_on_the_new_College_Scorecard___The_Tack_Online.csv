Last month the U.S PERIOD Department of Education launched its new College Scorecard system an interactive online tool that offers updated data for both current and prospective college students and families and allows them to compare institutions by graduation rate cost to attend and salary after graduating PERIOD

According to Buena Vista University Vice President for Enrollment Management Mike Frantz the College Scorecard website is part of President Barack Obamas overall plan to hold higher education more accountable for showing its value PERIOD

This was a much bigger planned initiative by the Obama Administration PERIOD They have been very consistent throughout their tenure trying to push for greater transparency about college information Frantz said PERIOD

While the system increases transparency many in higher education including officials at BVU feel the statistical ratings of the Scorecard do not accurately reflect the more complex outcomes of students attending that college PERIOD They worry that the Scorecards simple threescore report of cost of attendance graduation rate and income could make actual comparison difficult PERIOD

Frantz said the initial vision for the system was more complex but that the product online now is simplified PERIOD

It appears that this has become too big of a monster to do this in the way it was first envisioned PERIOD And so for whatever reason it got boiled down to reporting on just three data items he said PERIOD

Frantz noted accuracy is further compromised because the system allows users to compare institutions ranging from Ivy League schools to state universities to community colleges to private colleges to trade schools as if they are similar to each other PERIOD

What this system does is assume all colleges are the same Frantz said noting that students attending colleges across the nation are all very different demographically PERIOD

Differences among students are socioeconomic academic whatever it may be and so Im not convinced it is a good comparison tool to measure quality Frantz said PERIOD Even the average salary data does not support geography. so where does BVU stack up on the College Scorecard Currently according to Scorecard calculations BVU has an average annual cost of  dollars a graduation rate of  and an expected average salary of  dollars after graduation PERIOD This data is all based on national averages of all variety of institutions PERIOD These numbers place BVU just slightly above the national average PERIOD

Director of University Marketing and Communications Jennifer Felton agrees that this limited information does not give a full picture of what BVU or any university truly offers PERIOD

This is really one tiny set of research in comparison to a deep set of research Felton said PERIOD People want to know the history of the institution PERIOD They dont just want a oneyear snapshot PERIOD They want to know other things so its kind of narrow PERIOD You get three data points when schools have a lot more to share. another complication on the site is that schools do not appear sidebyside for comparison PERIOD They appear in an alphabetical list which can make comparing universities a student is interested in difficult PERIOD

You have to do a lot of hunting and pecking Frantz said PERIOD

Overall BVU officials do not feel the new Scorecard has had a negative effect on enrollment PERIOD In fact according to Franz there are more transfer students this year than there has been in quite some time and the University also had the highest freshmentosophomore retention rate in  years PERIOD
