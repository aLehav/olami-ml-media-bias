One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

Unfunny comedians devout Christians and academic failures all have one thing in common  they employ selfdebasement the act of disrespecting and belittling oneself in character esteem or worth PERIOD Somehow selfdebasement is both highly valued and tasteless both mentally destructive and selfish PERIOD How could one simple practice infiltrate such a broad range of societys pinnacles

Selfdebasement is tasteless

Comedy is saturated with controversy PERIOD Most humor is at least roughly based on the truth PERIOD Content is frequently derived from political issues or otherwise touchy subjects whichcome with a backlash that can make or break a comedians career PERIOD One of the most successful ways to be absolved of all that potential opposition is to joke about oneself PERIOD

Such humor often presents itself in the form of selfdeprecation a genre of comedy that not even the most exquisite delivery can make tolerable PERIOD The absolute lowest form of humor selfdeprecating comedy requires minimal effort and is indicative of a comedians mediocracy PERIOD This includes eyerollinducing jokes like Feel free to use me as a bad example PERIOD That way I wont be totally useless or its garbage day i cant believe they finally made a day dedicated to me. the socalled humor is comparable to naming your plant a simple human name like Bob or Brenda. if you must make such a joke I recommend using sardonic humor which cracks at insecurity but encompasses more layers than deprecation alone PERIOD While negative in nature sardonicism requires a sense of intellect to produce and comprehend thus assigning it a higher value than debasement PERIOD Sardonicism is often employed by our favorite sitcom characters like Chandler Bing Matthew Perry The Good Fight from the TV show Friends. a classic example is an exchange between Monica Courteney Cox Scream VI and Chandler when the bunch was watching old home videos PERIOD In defense of her weight Monica says that The camera adds  pounds to which Chandler responds with How many cameras were actually on you

Aside from the depth of the humor sardonicism and depreciation differ in one glaring aspect Sardonic jokes are often at the expense of someone else rather than oneself PERIOD As a result sardonic humor typically avoids the pitfalls of selfdebasement PERIOD

Selfdebasement is selfish

Selfdebasement is selfish just as selfish as arrogance both ends of the spectrum focus solely on you and the reasons why you are the best or the worst person to ever exist PERIOD For someone who thinks so lowly of themselves people who selfdebase sure do think theyre worthy of being discussed PERIOD

There is a thin line between humility and debasement derived partly by intention PERIOD Those who practice humility recognize their worth and refrain from boasting to salvage the feelings of others whereas those who practice selfdeprecation consider themselves worthless PERIOD They highlight their failures for the sake of attention or to lower other peoples expectations of them either way it all revolves around them PERIOD

To speak only of yourself whether in a negative or positive sense is a selfish act PERIOD It indicates a narrow inward view of the world without consideration of other people PERIOD

Selfdebasement is harmful

All of reality is processed in our brains lies truth fiction and fact PERIOD Russian playwright Anton Chekhov puts it simply when he writes Man is what he believes. in third grade it took me four minutes to complete my times tables PERIOD The fastest students time   seconds  was posted to the bulletin board the following morning accompanied by their name and a purple star sticker PERIOD I took this opportunity to declare myself bad at math. what started as a belief soon became a reality PERIOD With every missed homework problem this persona grew stronger and more affirmed PERIOD My thirdgrade failure was not being the last kid in my class to finish multiplying it was taking that result and turning it into a blanket statement of my abilities PERIOD

Our brains believe what we tell them regardless of context PERIOD The human brain doesnt care if youre making a joke If you tell yourself youre stupid enough times you will begin to believe it PERIOD The whole fad of positive affirmations is based on the same philosophy  we are easily convinced by our own thoughts PERIOD So repeating mantras like I am strong and I am capable can make a person feel and eventually act strong and capable PERIOD

The study How the Rich and Happy Get Richer and Happier ultimately concludes that positivity and believing in oneself is the key to success PERIOD It seems simple but those with higher selfevaluations were found to be more satisfied in their careers be happier overall and record higher work performance PERIOD These personal and careerrelated successes may be why this groups selfevaluations were so high to begin with thus indicating the presence of another positive feedback loop  one focused on selfappreciation PERIOD

Selfdebasement is valued

Selfdebasement has not only tainted the field of comedy PERIOD Its classless milieu is widely pervasive especially in religious contexts PERIOD Monotheistic religions like Christianity view selfdebasement as an indication of the utmost faith PERIOD Looking down before God is a virtue and according to the Bible we must recognize our own worthlessness lest we deem ourselves equal to God PERIOD Im not going to claim I know better than a religion with more than  billion followers and  years of practice but I will warn that in religion or comedy selfdebasement is a risky practice PERIOD

Selfdebasement is often viewed as an indication of humility which is a highly valued social act in Western culture PERIOD Humility signifies the extension of compassion the ability to remove oneself from their inner lens and posit the struggles and feelings of others PERIOD Socially the act of being humble is a virtue and makes a person more tolerable if not likable PERIOD

Simply because a practice is respected or even accepted does not mean its a good practice in any sense PERIOD Be skeptical of behaviors society or religions deem normal and most importantly stop engaging in selfdebasement PERIOD Nobody enjoys it especially not your future self PERIOD
