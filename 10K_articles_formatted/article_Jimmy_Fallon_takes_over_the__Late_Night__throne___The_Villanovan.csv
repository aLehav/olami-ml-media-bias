Taking over as host of Late Night after Conan OBrien left for The Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon was put in a nowin situation PERIOD

OBrien was so different and entertaining that comparisons were bound to be made immediately PERIOD As a former Saturday Night Live cast member and movie star Fallon has a lot of experience in front of the camera PERIOD However the talk show genre is a different beast and after a week of shows Fallon seems like an entertaining interviewer but must work with his writing staff on some of the comedy bits PERIOD

The monologues were rough and short all week but it was enjoyable that when a joke garnered positive response Fallon pretended to bowl a strike PERIOD

Having the Roots as his house band is incredibly awesome as they play a diverse array of music and helped on one of the more unique bits of the week when Fallon Slowjammed the news. with that bit he went over news highlights in a song PERIOD

Comedy bits that did not work were Lick it for  a reality show Fallon did about his first days in his new office making an audience member president of the audience a Facebook status segment and scripted skits with Robert Deniro and Donald Trump PERIOD Lick it for  was one of the worst ways to kill ten minutes of his first show as the whole thing consisted of people in the audience licking clean office products for  PERIOD There was nothing funny or worthwhile about it PERIOD

Fallon shined in the first week with his interviews PERIOD Following a debacle of a first night where Fallon and Robert Deniro had one of the more uncomfortable interviews in television history Fallon improved PERIOD

Examples of the fun included Fallon and Tina Fey reminiscing over past hairdos they had dancing with Cameron Diaz singing with Justin Timberlake beer pong with Serena Williams and the conversation with his close friend Drew Barrymore PERIOD

With the interviews it could be seen that Fallon has a knack for making witty remarks telling funny stories and knowing when to let his guest speak and not talking over him or her PERIOD

Ratings were high for the first week a sign that Fallon has fans willing to give him a shot PERIOD

As he continues tweaking the comedy bits and gaining more experience it is only a matter of time before Late Night with Jimmy Fallon is an excellent program PERIOD
