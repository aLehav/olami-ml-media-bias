Meet the District  supervisor candidate Amy Reichert

On Aug PERIOD  the Pac12 Conferenceannounced the cancellation of fall sports through the end of  due to COVID19 PERIOD With that in place San Diego State mens soccer is trying to stay as involved as possible by maintaining a positive attitude and focusing their attention on a newlyestablished leadership program started by head coach Ryan Hopkins PERIOD

The team is currently utilizing Zoom to stay in contact with each other PERIOD They meet every Friday to talk about other ideas involved in society PERIOD

I designed a leadership program based on leadership books Ive read in the past Hopkins told The Daily Aztec PERIOD A couple topics that weve talked about so far are maximizing potential racism diversity inclusion and social justice which was really powerful. the new program has allowed the team to learn more about each other PERIOD For Hopkins he loves getting to know more and more about his team  especially since he is a firstyear head coach PERIOD

Its been really awesome for me just being able to understand my team individually Hopkins said PERIOD Some of these guys are like theyve never had a coach that cared about me or cared about me as a person or tried to develop these things in me so Ive enjoyed it PERIOD Guys have really taken to it. outside of Zoom the team is taking a break right now from soccer activities PERIOD Before the shut down the team was able to get three weeks of practice in PERIOD

The practices were a little challenging for us as well because we couldnt have any contact with one another Hopkins said PERIOD All we could do was pass the ball around while maintaining a distance of at least six feet apart. hopkins said having the mere opportunity to get back out on the field helped the team mentally PERIOD

The biggest challenge for our players right now is their mental health because theyre so wrapped up in being soccer players and taking away soccer for them could be mentally draining Hopkins said PERIOD Thats why we talk about what are you outside of soccer because at some point soccer is all going to end anyways so we kind of force them to face these issues maybe a little earlier than they normally would have. the Aztecs are hoping for a spring return to action PERIOD Hopkins said the team continues to hold meetings with the Pac12 Conference about a season resumption and what the season could potentially look like PERIOD

Whenever were able to play again the guys on the team will be ready Hopkins said PERIOD I think in  years these guys want to look back and say this was the team that put us on the map and that turned the culture around for San Diego State mens soccer. redshirt senior winger Laukoa Santos said the team is staying positive and focusing on learning more about each other during the postponement PERIOD

Weve been a positive group since sports went down Santos said PERIOD It was tough at first but coach and some of us older guys have rejuvenated the spirit in the young guys. the Waikoloa Hawaii native has appreciated the online exercises the team has been participating in since the season postponement was announced PERIOD

I found out a lot about myself and my teammates through these exercises Santos said PERIOD Hopkins has done a really good job of integrating our team through online resources PERIOD Hes doing the most with what he can. santos said the team wasnt surprised the season was postponed PERIOD

Before the season stopped I felt I was playing my best soccer last spring and over summer PERIOD It was a big bomb because I was more motivated than ever but I expected it Santos said PERIOD Postponement made me realize that you just need to take things day by day make the most of each day. santos said safety is number one priority but he cant wait to get back on the field with his teammates once they are cleared to play PERIOD

I cant wait to play the beautiful game when we get back Santos said PERIOD You dont really know how valuable something is until its taken away from you PERIOD I miss the fans and my family in the stands watching me and support me for playing the game I love and worked so hard for.",Men’s soccer turns to Hopkins’ leadership program during postponed season – The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
