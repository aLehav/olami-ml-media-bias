Partly cloudy skies PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm





EMS  is stationed at Station  located at  S PERIOD Greene Street in downtown PERIOD

In recent months firefighters at Greenville FireRescue say staff shortages have forced GFR officials to pull ambulances out of service which could impact service to students at East Carolina University PERIOD

GFR department records confirm that since Jan PERIOD  GFR has pulled EMS  andor EMS  out of service  times PERIOD The consequence of this move according to multiple GFR firefighters and GFRs TeleStaff system is a possible delay in ambulances responding to emergencies PERIOD The East Carolinian obtained access to GFRs TeleStaff system through a public records request PERIOD

One current GFR firefighter who spoke to The East Carolinian on the condition of anonymity said GFR is losing firefighters faster than they can be replaced PERIOD

We GFR are just so short on staff right now that they GFR management literally dont have enough people to staff all the units that we got currently the current GFR firefighter said PERIOD

The current GFR firefighter is referring to EMS  stationed at Station  near Vidant Medical Center and EMS  stationed at Station  in downtown Greenville PERIOD

GFRs Station  is already equipped with EMS  but EMS  serves as an additional resource for the fire department because of its high call volume according to multiple current GFR firefighters PERIOD The same is true for Station  with EMS  and EMS  PERIOD

Station  is primarily responsible for some of the apartment complexes north of the universitys main campus along with ECUs dormitories and some classroom buildings said a current GFR EMS Specialist who also spoke to The East Carolinian on the condition of anonymity PERIOD

If youre at Station  and youre on EMS for the day and the other EMS unit EMS  is out of service then absolutely you already know when you come to work that youre going to have a busier day and night the EMS Specialist said PERIOD

Another GFR EMS Specialist put it in much simpler terms on days where EMS  is out of service EMS  has to cover an entire territory which includes a 29131person university PERIOD

The East Carolinian reached out to the city of Greenvilles Public Information Officer Brock Letchworth and City Manager Ann Wall about this story PERIOD However after multiple attempts to get any comment from Letchworth or Wall no emails were returned to The East Carolinian regarding any part of this story PERIOD

The East Carolinian also contacted ECU for a comment in response to the current GFR firefighters allegations PERIOD

Jamie Smith assistant director of News Services at ECU said the university does not have a new statement for The East Carolinian PERIOD She said the university believes its original statement from Bill Koch associate vice chancellor of Environmental Health and Campus Safety at ECU doesnt need to be changed PERIOD

In response to your requests for comment in September Mr PERIOD Koch said We have no evidence or reason to believe there are any issues with the Greenville FireRescue response to campus for emergencies said Smith in an emailed statement PERIOD

Smith said she spoke with an official from GFR and was reassured that services to ECU havent been impacted PERIOD She added ECU would revisit The East Carolinians request for a comment if the firefighters allegations were confirmed by GFR PERIOD

Station  and Station  are equipped with two ambulances each because of the higher call volume according to multiple GFR firefighters PERIOD However those GFR firefighters also said when one of the two ambulances are pulled out of service it puts greater stress on firefighters and can possibly cause a delay in responding to emergencies PERIOD

Multiple GFR firefighters said if one of the ambulances at Station  or Station  are tied up on a call and another medical call comes in usually the second ambulance would respond PERIOD

However on days where EMS  or EMS  are out of service an ambulance from another station must respond which could take several minutes according to the second EMS Specialist PERIOD

A current GFR lieutenant who spoke to The East Carolinian on the condition of anonymity said the departments leadership tries to use data to find times when the call volume is lower PERIOD

A second current GFR lieutenant who also spoke to The East Carolinian on the condition of anonymity said the staff shortages have forced the departments leadership into a tough spot PERIOD The second current GFR lieutenant said GFR leaders must decide whether to pull units out of service or rely on overtime and blow through GFRs overtime budget PERIOD

As far as Ive seen they ambulances have only been taken out of service when the call volume was low the second GFR lieutenant said PERIOD So rather than spend the money on overtime and have ambulances not run calls wed rather take some units out of service and save money on the overtime budget. gFR is forced to either rely on overtime or take units out of service because the department has dropped below its minimum staffing levels according multiple GFR firefighters PERIOD

A former GFR firefighter who spoke to The East Carolinian on the condition of anonymity due to a working relationship with the department in their new job said minimum staffing is set by the fire chief PERIOD

The former GFR firefighter said minimum staffing refers to the minimum number of firefighters GFR needs to operate all the units during each work shift PERIOD The former GFR firefighter added while he was at GFR the minimum staffing level was  firefighters PERIOD

What it below minimum staffing means is they dont have  people on shift and they GFR management have to pull four or five firefighters to meet the gap the former GFR firefighter said PERIOD

A second GFR firefighter who spoke to The East Carolinian on the condition of anonymity said if GFR didnt have a morale problem then it wouldnt be short staffed PERIOD

When you dont have people leaving the department then the department is staffed as it should be so you dont have to take vehicles out of service the second GFR firefighter said PERIOD









That is not good for the GFR at all PERIOD If the staff is less then that means the ambulances will reach an emergency situation at the best essay writing service less quick and thats not good PERIOD I hope that they hire more staff soon PERIOD
