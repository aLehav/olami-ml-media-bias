What will our lives be like in  What new technology will we have if any

Saavedra I think were gonna have some pretty awesome phones PERIOD

Galluzzi That dont explode PERIOD

Saavedra Yeah that dont explode PERIOD I think itll probably be like glass that doesnt break  super duper thin can project things PERIOD Theyre working on it PERIOD

Do you think that glass will be used for doors and windows or just for phones

Saavedra Just for phones because theres too much of a business for replacing glass windows and stuff PERIOD

How will your field of study evolve

Galluzzi For my field of study psychology I think theyre going to have awesome new brain scanning PERIOD I think thats the next step theyre trying to do  like look inside the brain and figure things out  and like with autism being such a big thing now but they dont really know what causes it PERIOD They dont know the reasons its there so I think in the future theyre going to have more answers for things we dont understand in terms of the human functions PERIOD

Saavedra The analysis would be so advanced PERIOD Wed be able to study the parents and tell you what the likelihood your child has of having a disorder before the child is even born PERIOD



What will America be like in 

Kilgannon I mean if Trump is in charge I doubt were going to be here so  Its all good PERIOD Well be fine PERIOD

Do you think well be technologically dependent or will we move past technology

Eisold I think well be highly technologically dependent PERIOD Were coming up with cutting edge technologies robotics  a lot of stuff is already autonomously operated  assembly lines everything like that PERIOD Even in military applications everything is just becoming run by computers and hardly anyone uses analog computers or anything like that anymore PERIOD Even cars have wifi in them and theyre looking to be driven by themselves PERIOD Tesla is already doing that and theyre getting into car accidents with people who are driving PERIOD

Soon after its release publications started saying that Pokemon GO resulted in people exercising PERIOD Do you think well invent more technologies that will help people get active

Kilgannon I mean how long did it help for Who still plays Pokemon GO There are a couple people still playing but is it this huge thing that it was when it came out where people are like walking in the street and getting hit by cars over it So like overall itll make a blip and it will change it for a moment  but it doesnt  its not gonna change things in the long run PERIOD

And in regards to mechanical engineering

Eisold Im ecstatic because the advancements that were making are just going to be huge PERIOD Robotics is going to take off PERIOD Bio engineering  for like prosthetics and everything  is going to take off really quick just because of the advancements were making with neuroscience and you can make a connection between the two PERIOD I think by  well have insane prosthetics PERIOD A lot of the aliments that humanity faces now will not be a factor in  just because of the advancements in technology just in that field alone  and thats just bioengineering PERIOD



What do you think the world will be like in 

I think people on average will be living longer than they are now PERIOD I would hope thats a safe bet  years going into the future PERIOD I can go along with that and say our medical technology will advance PERIOD So I think if we dont have a cure for most cancers well at least be much much closer PERIOD I hope we do have better solutions  years in the future PERIOD

In regards to the conveniences though do you think those are wholly convenient or do you think they have some kind of hinder on society

Well it depends on whos using them PERIOD I think youll always have people who use things in a positive way and those that detract  who dont use it so wisely PERIOD Just like today with cell phones smart phones computers PERIOD You have people who do great things and you also have hackers and people who try to do malware and viruses so people can use something for both good and bad PERIOD

How will what youre doing now change in another  years

Ill be working pretty advanced in my career PERIOD Ill have at least five years before official retirement if Im with the National Weather Service or a similar agency PERIOD I hope to continue working up until retirement age unless something else presents itself a better opportunity God willing PERIOD I have an optimists future PERIOD Things will get better PERIOD Theres curves in the road things you face PERIOD Theres obstacles for everybody PERIOD But I think if you have enough humility and you surround yourself with good people who are hopefully smarter than you then youll get to stick around a little bit longer PERIOD Humility is a big one and thats something Im always working on PERIOD



What do you think the world will be like in 

I think the environment will be a lot worse off PERIOD I dont know PERIOD I have enough faith that people will continue to get better and more humane but I dont necessarily have faith that government will continue in the same fashion PERIOD I think that would be surprising PERIOD

Do you hope it continues in the same fashion

I think theres improvement thats happening now PERIOD Its just really slow so I dont see it picking up the pace all that much PERIOD But progress is better than no progress even if it is a little bit PERIOD I hope it will be better in the future for the next generations PERIOD I hope that our generation is more open minded than previous ones but I think we have to stick to what we think now in order for the later generations to be able to have different views PERIOD

If social media is used in the same way it is now in  years do you think that will be a good or bad thing

I think good because having the separation of countries and the people in them so severely is not a positive thing PERIOD Were all on the same Earth PERIOD We all ultimately want the same things and I think people being able to understand that people in other places arent that different is important PERIOD
