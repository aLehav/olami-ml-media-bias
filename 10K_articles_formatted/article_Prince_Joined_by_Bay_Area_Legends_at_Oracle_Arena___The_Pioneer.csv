9782,2023-11-04,"tickets went on sale only three days before the first show and Prince gave the soldout arena their moneys worth with his triple encore performance PERIOD

I got too many hits were gonna be here all night Oakland Prince said as he came back on stage for the first encore PERIOD

The line to get into the Oracle Arena was already wrapped around the corner an hour before the show PERIOD

The fans in attendance were very diverse PERIOD The ages ranged from teens to septuagenarians and the clothing varied even more from casual to formal to borderline disturbing PERIOD

Many fans pulled out whatever purple clothing they could find in their closet PERIOD There were purple jackets shirts dresses leggings and even hair PERIOD

The outside doors were supposed to open at  p.m PERIOD for the  showhowever they didnt start letting people in until  p.m PERIOD

Thrilled to get out of the mid30 degree weather these Purple Rain fans began flooding through the doors without hesitation PERIOD

Once inside the building people werent allowed to go to their seats PERIOD As a result the hallways began to fill to capacity and many complained that it was creating a fire hazard PERIOD

The doors to the seating sections werent opened until about  p.m PERIOD

The chaotic and disorganized start to the night was discouraging to some fans but with the start of the show all that was put to rest PERIOD

When the lights went out the crowd went crazy PERIOD Princes voice was heard over the loudspeaker introducing the opening act Larry Graham and Graham Central Station PERIOD

Lead bass player Larry Graham and his group had the audience on their feet within minutes PERIOD They performed some of their wellknown hits from backintheday including One in a Million. the whole crowd began to harmonize together when they started performing songs from Grahams original group Sly and The Family Stone PERIOD

The performance of Family Affair had the crowd jumping out of their seats and united them as just that a family PERIOD

Graham who is in his mid60s was jumping around the stage as though he wasnt a day over  PERIOD

The speed at which his fingers were flying up and down his bass was phenomenal not to mention his band and vocalists sounded just as crisp as they did  years ago PERIOD

At one point he played the bass with the microphone pole and then with his mouth PERIOD Prince made his way to the stage during Grahams last song Everyday People. prince enhanced the already pumped up crowd PERIOD

With smoke rising from the stage and lights flashing Prince threw his guitar and kicked over the microphone pole PERIOD

The intensity of this one song gave off that of a shows grand finale and ironically enough the true show had only just begun PERIOD

Once the show resumed Prince was lifted to the stage smoke surrounding him PERIOD On stage with him was the famous percussionist Oaklandborn Sheila Escovedo better known as Sheila E PERIOD

The show opened with Uptown and the entire arena was up on their feet dancing PERIOD

In fact the majority of the crowd stayed on their feet throughout the entire show PERIOD

Prince wore a white suit with a black stripe down the side a black shirt open in the front to show off his chest and white heeled boots PERIOD

He was nonstop for the entire show like a 52yearold Energizer bunny PERIOD

Sheila E. who is also in her early 50s was in her stilettos dancing right alongside Prince for the whole show PERIOD During her drum solo she let the crowd know that even after all these years she still had it PERIOD

As though Sheila E PERIOD wasnt a big enough surprise Carlos Santana showed up for one song PERIOD He hopped on stage grabbed a guitar and blew the crowd away PERIOD

This was truly a once in a lifetime reunion of the Bay Area with Larry Graham and Graham Central Station Sheila E PERIOD and Carlos Santana all on one stage PERIOD

The climax of the concert was the performance of his favorite hit Purple Rain. the entire stage and Oracle Arena transformed into a purple oasis PERIOD

Flashing purple lights shot across every section of the crowd fans were singing couples held onto one another and some eyes even watered up at the sound of the heartfelt vocals of Prince PERIOD

At the end of the song Prince said Thank you and exited the stage but the fans knew this would not be the end of the show PERIOD

As fans had anticipated Prince returned to the stage this time dressed headtotoe in gold glittery attire PERIOD He resumed the show with Kiss. he went on to perform If I Was Your Girlfriend and a few slower songs including Scandalous. the show reached yet another peak when he performed Adore. eyes closed and head thrown back Prince was definitely feeling the music as he performed PERIOD

At one point in the song he even dropped to his kneeswhile still holding his poignant note of course PERIOD

Yet again Prince thanked the audience for coming out and for the second time he said good night. this time the entire band left the stage stage lights went out and the house lights came on PERIOD As a result some crowd members started making their way out of the arena PERIOD

The diehard fans simply would not accept that conclusion PERIOD After about five minutes of clapping cheering and screaming his name Prince walked back on stage for his third encoreunbelievable

The house lights went back out the stage lights came back on and yet another great performance erupted PERIOD

For the last and final song he performed Welcome  America which is also the title of his current tour PERIOD

The overall show was mindblowing PERIOD Being in the same building as this icon was a privilege in itself PERIOD

His vibrant energy stage presence and sense of humor made him appealing to the audience PERIOD

That along with his brilliant band surprise guests divine voice and moves so sensual they could bring an any woman or man to their knees made this show definitely a mustsee for anybody PERIOD

The two scheduled shows were Monday Feb PERIOD  and Wednesday Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

Due to overwhelming demand they have added one last show for tonight PERIOD Get tickets while you can PERIOD
