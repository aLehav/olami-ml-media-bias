Halfway through the football season the San Francisco 49ers are struggling to keep it together PERIOD Bad coaching decisions and subpar performances on the field have likely sabotaged any chance the Niners of making it to the playoffs PERIOD

After starting the season off with one win the 49ers have dropped the last six straight PERIOD On Oct PERIOD  the 49ers lost  to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers an inexperienced team that is only  PERIOD San Francisco needs to beat teams like Tampa Bay if they want to have a chance to save the season PERIOD

With week nine coming up the 49ers need to start making a turn for the better if they want to try and sneak into the Wild Card Game PERIOD San Francisco is currently in secondtolast place in the league with a  record PERIOD They have to win at least seven of their last nine games to even have a chance at a Wild Card berth PERIOD It will take nothing short of a complete 180degree turn for them to make the playoffs but many things are holding them back PERIOD

Head coach Chip Kellys decisionmaking has been called into question several times this season while leading the 49ers PERIOD He has been repeatedly questioned about the starting quarterback position Kelly began the season with Blaine Gabbert as the starting quarterback and his lessthanstellar play has shown no signs of improvement PERIOD Gabbert the former firstround draft pick comes into the halfway point of the season with a  record a completion percentage of   passing yards five touchdowns and six interceptions PERIOD These poor numbers have recently earned him the backup role and Colin Kaepernick has moved to the starting role PERIOD

Kaepernick began the season as the backup quarterback and his stats as a starter are not much better PERIOD He comes in with a completion percentage of   yards four touchdowns and two interceptions PERIOD Although Kaepernick has only started three games this season and is  his stats are similar to Gabberts PERIOD

Currently the 49ers are ranked thirtieth in the league out of  teams PERIOD We all know the famous quote Defense wins Championships but team defense is a big problem San Francisco needs to fix PERIOD Shutting down the other teams offense is huge and in order to do that the Niners need to tackle better cover receivers better and stop teams from running the ball all things they struggle with PERIOD Remember when Seattle crushed Denver  in Super Bowl XLVIII in  That was largely due to how well Seattles defense played that night PERIOD Defense is surely one area 49er coaches addressed during the bye week two weeks ago PERIOD

Offense is an even bigger area of concern for San Francisco their offense is ranked dead last so far this year thanks to an inability to pass or run the ball consistently PERIOD

In addition to their bad play on the field the San Francisco 49ers have been voted the worst franchise in sports at the moment in a recent poll last month from ESPN PERIOD Out of the four major sports in the United States  football baseball basketball and hockey  the 49ers were ranked  out of  teams PERIOD The storied franchise has been dropping in the ranking for quite some time now PERIOD According to the standings which are based on a combination of calculations and fan voting the Niners have the worst fan relations of any team in the United States PERIOD

Other notable rankings include finishing one hundred and eighteenth in ownership one hundred and thirteenth in coaching one hundred and sixteenth in players one hundred and seventeenth in affordability one hundred and fifth in stadium experience and one hundred and thirteenth in bang for buck. sports broadcast KNBR reported on an ESPN ranking of all professional sports teams PERIOD This once storied franchises collapse is the biggest in sports history PERIOD
