Chris Masoud  Thursday January  

Heading into the heart of the Big East season No PERIOD  Notre Dame looks to keep pace among the conference leaders as it hosts St PERIOD Johns Sunday PERIOD The Irish fell to the Red Storm last season  on the road snapping an eightgame win streak PERIOD

Despite the additional motivation of returning the favor Irish coach Muffet McGraw said her team is simply focused on racking up another conference victory PERIOD

Theyre a ranked opponent so its another opportunity for us to improve our RPI McGraw said PERIOD Theyve got a good RPI and of course just beating a Big East team every game is really important for us PERIOD Weve got to take care of the home court. notre Dame   Big East is riding a threegame win streak and is currently ranked fourth in the conference standings PERIOD While St PERIOD Johns   has yet to separate itself from the pack the Red Storm feature a number of talented players who have risen to the occasion against the Irish PERIOD

Averaging . points per game sophomore guard Shenneika Smith shredded the Irish for  points and  rebounds in the Red Storms victory last season PERIOD

Last year there were three really good freshmen in the league  Skylar Diggins Sugar Rodgers from Georgetown and Shenneika McGraw said PERIOD Shes a great athlete she can shoot over you shes got great elevation on her jumper she can shoot threes  shes really a dangerous player and a very difficult matchup for us. in addition to Smith junior forward DaShena Stevens is a dual threat for St PERIOD Johns who also had a big game during Notre Dames previous loss to the Red Storm PERIOD Stevens finished with  points and  rebounds in the contest and currently averages . rebounds per game PERIOD

Thats going to be a good matchup McGraw said PERIOD DaShenas a really good player for St PERIOD Johns PERIOD Its going to be a battle on the boards because shes an excellent rebounder too PERIOD I think that was how they beat us at St PERIOD Johns last year  she really played well she scored a lot inside and got a lot of rebounds PERIOD Thats a key matchup. the Irish will rely on the post presence of junior forward Devereaux Peters and freshman forward Natalie Achonwa to keep Stevens in check PERIOD Peters was named to the Big East Honor Roll for the third consecutive week on Monday after averaging . point and . rebounds in two games last week PERIOD

Achonwa has opened a number of eyes in her first Big East campaign averaging . points and . rebounds in just  minutes per game PERIOD The 18yearold Canadian has been a lift off the bench for McGraw who has started to gradually increase her playing time as she incorporates a larger lineup in conference play PERIOD

I think that freshman Natalie Achonwa has really contributed a lot the entire season and now shes getting a little more playing time McGraw said PERIOD I think that all the posts are getting a little more playing time and its been really good PERIOD But rebounding is one of Natalies strengths and that is something that shes pretty much done all year PERIOD And now Devereaux is getting some doublefigure rebounding games as well. although the Irish are poised to finish the conference season with one of the top seeds heading into the Big East Championships a number of teams have emerged as legitimate contenders PERIOD While Connecticut remains the favorite to win a Big East title six teams in the conference including St PERIOD Johns are ranked in the top25 of the USA Today Coaches Poll PERIOD

Along with the Huskies   Rutgers   and DePaul   remain unbeaten in conference play PERIOD

Its a great league PERIOD Toptobottom its just so difficult McGraw said PERIOD Theres probably nine teams with a shot at the NCAA tournament PERIOD DePaul is probably one of the surprises in the league this year with the way theyve started out. the Blue Demons are off to the best start in program history and will face the Irish in the final conference game of the regular season PERIOD Until then Notre Dame will continue to plow through its conference schedule beginning Sunday at  p.m PERIOD against St PERIOD Johns at the Purcell Pavilion PERIOD
