This interview with Maddie Charne  is the second installment of a biweekly series PersonaliTV in which I profile different students to see whether their television inclinations have anything to do with who they are PERIOD

Charnes favorite shows are The West Wing Slings and Arrows Dead Like Me and Dr PERIOD Who PERIOD Her guilty pleasures include Top Chef Once Upon a Time and Lost Girl PERIOD But what do these shows say about her Read on to find out PERIOD

Grant Torre How did you get into each of these TV shows

Maddie Charne

Dead Like Me My mom and I started watching Dead Like Me together when I was in eighth grade PERIOD My father died when I was young and the show actually helped the two of us through the grieving process PERIOD I still watch it now though divorced from that PERIOD It is funny smart and brilliantly directed PERIOD

The West Wing I watched the last episode of this show when it was on TV with my best friend whod been an avid watcher for the whole series PERIOD I fell in love and have been slowly watching the series since then PERIOD I now have marathons of the first four seasons at least once a year PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Who I started watching it off a recommendation two or three years ago PERIOD I started slow but have been quickly accelerating and am all caught up PERIOD I have even watched a few episodes of the classic doctors now PERIOD

Slings and Arrows My boyfriend and I got told by multiple sources that wed love this show PERIOD We were told so frequently and repeatedly that we started watching together last spring PERIOD We watched all three seasons before the end of the semester which given our schedules was a feat PERIOD

Lost Girl To be honest it was a Netflix recommendation PERIOD I have gotten sick of all the characters but I love the mythology

Once Upon a Time Another Netflix recommendation PERIOD I had been meaning to watch it when it first came on but I never had the time PERIOD Last spring I had my appendix out and bingewatched the whole first season while recovering PERIOD

Buffy the Vampire Slayer Some people would say that isnt a guilty pleasure but I always feel a little embarrassed when people see this on my Netflix queue PERIOD I got into it in high school and have rewatched the first four seasons too many times to count but I still havent watched the last two seasons PERIOD

GT Are these shows an escape from reality

MC Oh man PERIOD Yes They all kind of are PERIOD Id say Dr PERIOD Who Lost Girl Once Upon a Time and Buffy the Vampire Slayer especially but I always use TV as an escape PERIOD Its the thing to do when you need a mental pause or a laugh or a way out of a bad day PERIOD

GT How do you watch TV at Swat

MC I use Netflix and sometimes check out a season or two out of McCabe PERIOD

GT Why should other Swatties watch your favorite TV shows and guilty pleasures

MC I think my TV shows fall into two different sometimes overlapping categories fantasy and sarcastic witty humor PERIOD Buffy the Vampire Slayer Once Upon a Time Lost Girl Dr PERIOD Who and in some ways Dead Like Me fall into fantasy PERIOD Buffy the Vampire Slayer Dr PERIOD Who Slings and Arrows and The West Wing fall into humor PERIOD I think in particular the humor category would appeal to most Swatties PERIOD

I like things that poke fun at things that I observe in the world PERIOD I also like humor that tends towards the absurd sometimes PERIOD You definitely see that in Slings and Arrows and Dead Like Me both of which use gallows humor and death as comedic elements PERIOD I think Swatties would also enjoy the fantasy category though PERIOD I like fantasy that feels like fairy tales and myths PERIOD I like to use those shows to escape the work and stress of Swarthmore and go somewhere different and new and exciting for a little while PERIOD

GT Have you ever been judged or stereotyped for liking a certain show

MC Definitely PERIOD Particularly Buffy the Vampire Slayer PERIOD I think theres a very particular group of people who like that show and Ive been lumped together and stereotyped quite frequently particularly in high school PERIOD That might be why I label it a guilty pleasure show PERIOD

GT Have you ever bonded with someone or made friends through mutual love of a TV show

MC Of course Im not sure I ever become friends just because of it but I definitely bond with people over shows all the time PERIOD In particular the shows on my list that are less popular PERIOD For instance when I find someone else who also knows and loves Slings and Arrows or Dead Like Me I know Ill likely have some great conversations PERIOD

GT Do your TV habits reflect your personality

MC In some sense yes PERIOD I dont think any of the shows on the list would seem out of character PERIOD But Im not sure this is the list people would guess for me PERIOD And I feel like some of them dont go together well PERIOD For instance The West Wing and Lost Girl feel weird on the same list PERIOD

GT If you could get into a new series what would it be

MC Definitely Orange Is The New Black PERIOD Ive been meaning to watch it for a long time PERIOD Im also trying to catch up with Mad Men but thats not a new series and I have watched a few seasons already PERIOD
