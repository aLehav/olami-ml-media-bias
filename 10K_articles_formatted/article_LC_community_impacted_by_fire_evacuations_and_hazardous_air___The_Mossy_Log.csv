Over the past several days authorities have told some Lewis  Clark community members to be ready to evacuate due to nearby fires PERIOD While residents of Clackamas County were preparing to possibly evacuate students on campus and in Multnomah County have been dealing with hazardous air quality PERIOD

In August lightning struck some southern Oregon counties during a particularly dry and hot summer resulting in several wildfires PERIOD By Aug PERIOD  many of these fires seemed to be under control with more than  containment PERIOD However on Sept PERIOD  high winds over  miles per hour led to more wildfires and exacerbated existing fires PERIOD

Currently there are over  wildfires in Oregon PERIOD Seventeen of them have burned  acres or more PERIOD Altogether over  million acres have burned and over  people have been forced to evacuate their homes in search of refuge PERIOD Over  more are in areas with evacuation warnings PERIOD Clackamas County the county that borders LC to the south has been in various levels of evacuation for the past week PERIOD

The presence of multiple fires has made conditions especially dangerous PERIOD The Beachie Creek fire near Detroit Oregon was originally burning just  acres PERIOD After the Sept PERIOD  windstorm it grew to over  acres overnight PERIOD By Sept PERIOD  it had briefly merged with the Lionshead fire PERIOD Additionally the 134000acre Riverside fire in Clackamas County has gotten within  miles of Portland PERIOD

Unlike many Oregon fires of the past these events are directly impacting the LC community PERIOD A number of faculty and upperclassmen live in areas surrounding Portland that are under evacuation warnings PERIOD Assistant Professor of International Affairs Laura Vinson lives in the Milwaukee area and had been under a Level  evacuation notice PERIOD Still smoke from the nearby fires has significantly impacted her home PERIOD

The room where I teach in my home started getting more smoky on Thursday and I couldnt teach down there now Vinson said PERIOD

She is hopeful that by this next week the smoke will clear out and the fires will die down PERIOD However she is worried about whether she is making the right choice by not evacuating immediately PERIOD

Alys Chang  lives in a flat in Lake Oswego PERIOD Chang has also been under a Level  evacuation warning since early September PERIOD Although she is from California she never expected to deal with a wildfire at LC PERIOD At first she began taking precautions buying an air filter and filling up the gas in her car PERIOD However when the fires threatening Clackamas County merged Chang panicked PERIOD

I have two suitcases right now with basic necessities just in case I get moved up to a Level  she said PERIOD

Despite its close proximity to the areas impacted by the fires LC has been following guidance from Multnomah County PERIOD For the past week the county has maintained that residents need not worry about evacuation PERIOD According to a statement on the county website the threat of wildfire is not increasing in Portland PERIOD In a campuswide email sent last Thursday Vice President of Student Life and Dean of Students Robin HolmesSullivan echoed that statement and assured students that LC would continue to monitor the situation closely. chang is not satisfied with that answer PERIOD She understands that between the COVID19 pandemic and the wildfires administrators have a lot on their hands PERIOD However she expects better from LC PERIOD She hopes the school will support students through these two crises PERIOD

Im curious to see what Lewis  Clark has in store for students that are directly affected by the fires because theres a possibility that I need to evacuate Chang said PERIOD

Air quality not evacuation has been the main concern of administrators PERIOD Last Thursday a campuswide email was sent out detailing LCs response PERIOD Through at least Friday Sept PERIOD  all oncampus activities and classes have been canceled or moved online and students are being instructed to stay inside PERIOD LC offered access to medical resources in the email for students who may have negative reactions to the smoke PERIOD

Annika Bateman  lives in West Hall PERIOD As the fires began creeping closer to campus Bateman and her roommates were on lockdown PERIOD Effluent testing had revealed a potential positive in her hall and they were required to isolate until they had gotten a second round of saliva tests PERIOD

This week was extremely stressful Bateman said PERIOD

Bateman and Chang also mentioned how difficult it is to be learning through these events PERIOD

I have a headache and my chest feels bad Bateman said Its hard for me to be motivated and ready to learn.LC has maintained that students have little to worry about and that classes would resume online as long as air quality remains dangerous PERIOD On Monday Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Bruce Suttmeier emphasized in a campuswide email that the mission of the College is to provide an education to students even in challenging times perhaps especially in challenging times. according to administrators LC will continue to operate for the time being despite these extreme circumstances PERIOD

As students return to campus LC confirms undergraduate COVID19 case
