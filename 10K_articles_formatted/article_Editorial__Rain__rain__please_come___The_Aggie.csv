If youve noticed the number of sniffles and sneezes increase exponentially over the past few weeks do not panic PERIOD Avian flu hasnt reached UC Davis and a new supercold hasnt started within the bodies of us college students PERIOD The culprit of the extra classroom sounds is allergies PERIOD

Davis lies in the fertile Central Valley of California PERIOD Because of this come springtime flowers trees and grasses bloom and release an explosion of pollen into the air PERIOD This combined with the vicious Central Valley winds creates a vacuum of allergens that leads to sneezes and sniffles galore PERIOD And because of the dry winter and spring this season has been worse than ones in the past PERIOD

Unfortunately for us allergy sufferers there isnt an all encompassing answer to solving this problem PERIOD We buy Claritin rush through boxes of tissues and run the air purifier  PERIOD Still despite these preventive measures we continuously sneeze and itch our teary eyes PERIOD

There are a couple natural solutions that can help mitigate the amount of pollen filling up the nostrils of college students PERIOD The easiest one is rain PERIOD The one thing that we loathed most about Winter Quarter and couldnt wait to leave come Spring is exactly what we need now PERIOD Rain will literally wash away all the pollen floating around in the air providing relief to everyone PERIOD

Unfortunately rain wont be coming anytime soon PERIOD The closer we get to June the less likely those sweet clouds of alleviation appear and release their almighty water on the sunscorched earth PERIOD So its time for the bright minds of UC Davis to come up with another solution  a rain machine PERIOD

UC Davis boasts one of the top atmospheric science departments in the nation PERIOD Its time for the future weatherpeople of the world to develop an artificial cloud that can dump buckets of rain and clear out all the evil pollen floating around in the air PERIOD The obvious issue is where the water will come from PERIOD Well if they pull the water from a local reservoir there will be no water lost as it will fall and then drain into the same body it came from PERIOD This is clearly a winwin situation PERIOD

The only other reasonable option to limit sneezing and sniffling is to cut down the trees and plants that release the allergens into the air PERIOD So if the UC Davis thinktank cant come up with this rain machine theyd better get their clippers and saws ready to go PERIOD We allergy sufferers arent going to take it anymore PERIOD

This may all be an overreaction PERIOD Allergies are probably the most annoying thing in the world PERIOD There is no simple relief and unlike a cold we dont know when or if they will go away PERIOD So allergies please and respectfully fuck off PERIOD
