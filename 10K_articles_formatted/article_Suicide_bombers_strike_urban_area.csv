Israeli helicopters firing missiles blasted metal workshops in Gaza early today as Israels leadership met to consider how to respond to the deadliest single Palestinian attack since March when a suicide bomber killed  Israelis at a Passover meal PERIOD

The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades linked to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafats Fatah movement claimed responsibility for Sundays attack naming the bombers as two young men from the West Bank city of Nablus PERIOD There was also a less specific claim from the Islamic Jihad PERIOD

In Washington President Bush called the attack a despicable act of murder and said Secretary of State Colin Powell had called Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to express Americas condolences PERIOD

Today terrorists struck again in Israel murdering and injuring scores of civilians in Tel Aviv Bush said in a prepared statement last night PERIOD I condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms. it was the first suicide attack inside Israel since Nov PERIOD  when a bomber blew up a bus in Jerusalem killing  passengers PERIOD In the past such bombings have triggered largescale Israeli incursions in the West Bank and hardliners in Israels Cabinet have called for expelling Arafat but circumstances weighed against such a response PERIOD

Sharon was quick to blame Arafat though without mentioning his name PERIOD All attempts to reach a ceasefire even today are failing due to the Palestinian leadership that continues to support fund and initiate terror Sharon told a public gathering in Jerusalem PERIOD

The Palestinian Authority issued a statement saying it strongly condemns and fully rejects all crimes against civilians and the idea of revenge. the statement called for international intervention to help restore calm PERIOD

Anticipating Israels reaction Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat said We cannot accept the Israeli assigning blame on President Arafat or the Palestinian Authority PERIOD This is a broken record. in the past waves of Palestinian terrorism have helped hardline parties in Israeli elections PERIOD With voting set for Jan PERIOD  Sharons Likud Party hit hard by a corruption scandal stood to gain PERIOD However the proximity of the election also worked against a tough response which would be seen by opponents as electioneering PERIOD

Also Israel was picking up clear indications from the United States to keep the Mideast conflict on a low burn while the U.S PERIOD prepares for a possible attack on Iraq PERIOD

That factor was also working against expulsion of Arafat from the West Bank though a significant number of key Israeli Cabinet ministers including Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz are pressing for deportation PERIOD

Sharon who has had a decadeslong feud with Arafat and has effectively confined him to his West Bank headquarters for a year has resisted the pressure for political reasons not because he opposes deporting Arafat in principle PERIOD
