2874,2009-05-05,"uW senior Leah Vanevenhoven will look to pitch the Badgers to a win against Big Ten opponent Iowa.mediacredit

With the regular season wrapping up the University of Wisconsin softball team will travel to Iowa City to take on Iowa in what will be its final away series of the season PERIOD

The Badgers are on a relative hot streak winning two of their last three games and were it not for a walk off homerun from Michigan State the Badgers would have won their last three Big Ten games PERIOD The threegame winning streak over Big Ten opponents would have matched their current number of wins within the conference as they sit at  PERIOD Nonetheless recent success gives them reason to be optimistic PERIOD

The Hawkeyes   Big Ten will provide a formidable challenge for Wisconsin PERIOD Iowa has developed a strange trend throughout their season as they tend to win and lose games in bunches PERIOD Following a winning streak of four in early April they lost two in a row to Big Ten power Northwestern then went on to win five more in a row over Michigan State and Indiana and are currently riding a three game losing streak PERIOD Wisconsin will seek to maintain the Hawkeyes losing streak and extend it to five PERIOD

Senior Leah Vanevenhovens  record within Big Ten play during the second half of the season doesnt allude to the resurgence she has experienced in the circle PERIOD The number of wins doesnt tell the whole story about how strong Vanevenhoven has played lately especially with the absence of the other Badger starter Letty Olivarez due to illness PERIOD Within conference play the senior has a . eRA  strikeouts in  innings and has held opponents to a meager . batting average PERIOD

I only have a couple games left and Im just trying to make the best of them Vanevenhoven said PERIOD

It is no coincidence that since April  when the Badgers defeated rival Minnesota to curtail their 11game losing streak UW has allowed four hits or fewer an impressive five times in seven games PERIOD Of those five games Vanevenhoven started every single one PERIOD It is also no coincidence that this is Vanevenhovens senior year and theres nothing she wants more than to leave her program with a strong finish PERIOD

We play some tough teams now so I really need to be at the top of my game and I think you know I realize that its my last year PERIOD Im excited  bring on the challenge Vanevenhoven said PERIOD

I think its just determination  she wants to leave here feeling like she gave everything she has to give head coach Chandelle Schulte added PERIOD Ive seen Leah work harder this year than I ever have and its paid off. also coming on strong of late has been the play of freshman Karla Powell PERIOD In the April  game versus Minnesota she effectively yanked the monkey off the teams back by driving in the gamewinning run to beat Minnesota  PERIOD Her headfirst dive into first gave the Badgers the victory and also propelled their recent lateseason charge PERIOD After not playing the first game of last weekends series against Michigan State due to a shoulder injury Powell proved her bat is a necessary force within the Badger lineup PERIOD She responded by going  with two RBIs and scored a run of her own though the Badgers still lost on a walk off tworun home run by the Spartans Kara Weigle PERIOD

That kid just loves softball and shes a ballplayer Schulte said of Powell PERIOD Shes huge for our future I think. the potent Hawkeye offense boasts six hitters with averages of . or higher all of whom have on base percentages near . pERIOD Their best hitter Colleen McGlaughlin is hitting . on the year with nine home runs and  RBIs PERIOD In the circle the Hawkeyes have a tandem of two pitchers Brittany Well and Amanda Zust who each have  or more wins and have ERAs under . pERIOD

If we can lay off their rise ball depending on what the zone is well have some success Schulte said PERIOD
