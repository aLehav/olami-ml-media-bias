Mikes Take

The last time Penn State played IPFW and LoyolaChicago in the same weekend the Nittany Lions came out  PERIOD But that loss was to Loyola and the Lions rebounded the next night to beat IPFW in four sets PERIOD

In the victory the Lions relied heavily on stud middle hitters Max Holt and Max Lipsitz PERIOD Lipsitz had  kills while hitting . pERIOD Holt hit . and tallied  kills PERIOD The Lions needed to lean on their AllAmericans that night to carry them to victory PERIOD But they need to start getting outside hitters Will Price and Joe Sunder more involved and efficient in the offense PERIOD

With coach Mark Pavlik out sick this week Get well soon Pav. assistant coach Colin McMillan led practice and emphasized a more efficient offense PERIOD The offense apparently has received some minor tweaks and well see how it turns out PERIOD

What to Look For IPFW outside hitter Ben Duckworths service game PERIOD The sophomore leads the nation in aces per set PERIOD Well see how his serves stack up against Max Holts rockets PERIOD

Player of the Match Since Mike forgot to pick one in his email to yours truly well say Dennis Del Valle PERIOD

Score Penn State    

Toms Take

Coming off of two tough fiveset losses the Lions will try to rebound against IPFW tonight PERIOD Penn State will need to take better care of the ball this weekend something they werent able to do out west PERIOD

As Mike so astutely pointed out coach Pavlik was out sick this week get well soon Pav and itll be interesting to see how the team plays if McMillian is roaming the sidelines PERIOD I expect Penn State to rebound from these tough losses and look like the team weve seen for the majority of this season PERIOD

However if they struggle this weekend it may be time to ask some tougher questions about this team PERIOD

What to Look For If Mark Pavlik is coaching from the sidelines PERIOD

Player of the Match Ryan Sweitzer PERIOD Im gonna ride the hot hand with Sweitz on this one PERIOD Coming off of  kills look for Sweitzer to have another strong performance PERIOD

Score Penn State
