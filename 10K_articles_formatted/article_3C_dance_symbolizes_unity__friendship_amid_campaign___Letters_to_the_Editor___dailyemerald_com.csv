7637,1970-01-01,"this morning I decided to treat myself to a nice cup of coffee and relax after two strenuous weeks of campaigning PERIOD So I went to a coffee shop sipped my drink and hopped on Facebook PERIOD I soon found myself reading various articles in the ODE about the past couple of weeks PERIOD Call it obsession call it overkill call it whatever you want PERIOD I have a thirdgradegirlstyle crush on the ASUO and Im proud to admit it PERIOD

But never mind my romantic feelings toward the intricacies and processes of student government PERIOD What amuses me this morning is how many times Campus Change Coalition 3C is being called out for our sweet dancing on East thirteenth Avenue and University Street that we employed during primaries PERIOD Two recent letters to the editor have mentioned the dance as a silly way to attract attention to the votes and have cited it as evidence that ASUO elections are in fact a joke. friends I understand that the way I begin this sentence makes me sound like a douche I implore you PERIOD The 3C campaign was fueled by passionate driven and hardworking people who also enjoyed having a good time together PERIOD We believe in what we created together as a family and the dance was a way for us to have fun during elections and remember the reason we were running this mad dash in the first place each other  students who care about students fighting for an inclusive student government PERIOD

The 3C dance will be remembered in my mind as a rad event that brought us closer together as a campaign and put smiles on students faces as they strolled to class PERIOD And every time I hear the dance mentioned positively or negatively I will smile and remember how much it meant to take a break from the stress run outside with my friends and dance PERIOD
