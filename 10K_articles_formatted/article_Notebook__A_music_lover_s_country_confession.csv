My best friend came out as a country fan four months ago PERIOD

It was an unplanned confession pulled only from her lips after a series of unplanned circumstances and events PERIOD If Sarah had it her way I probably never wouldve found out at all  the secret would have stayed buried in her iTunes library and stoplight singing sessions for years to come PERIOD

But luck had its way that night and the veil of secrecy shed always worn didnt stand a chance against it PERIOD Sarah was picking me up for a party and by multiple twists of fate I didnt take as long to get ready as I normally do less traffic on the way home from the gym reheating leftovers instead of cooking setting out my outfit earlier in the day PERIOD It was a series of small shortcuts that shaved about  minutes off my goingout prep time  Sarah was expecting to wait  minutes but for the first time in our friendship I was ready to go in five PERIOD

And it was dark  darker than a typical moonlit night in August and too dark for her to see the outline of my body advancing down the driveway to her car PERIOD She had no idea I was coming and by the time I opened the door and climbed inside it was already too late PERIOD She had no time no warning no opportunity to switch the radio station before Luke Bryans Country Girls flooded my ear canals PERIOD

Sarah are you listening to country right now

Before you write me off as a pretentious melodramatic asshole let me briefly explain my friendship with Sarah PERIOD We had been nearly inseparable for about  years PERIOD Thats an entire decade of shared secrets embarrassing middleschool memories and enough blackmail opportunities to banish either one of us into a lifetime of hiding PERIOD

Yet in all that time her longtime passion for country music hadnt come up once  in fact the two of us regularly trashed the genre from our 14yearold sk8er rock days all the way through inexplicable obsessions with System of a Down and mainstream radio rap PERIOD Our music taste may have changed a lot in that decade but there was always one thing we could agree on Country sucked PERIOD

But there we were in her Buick soaking up more fiddles and big truck references than Id experienced in a lifetime PERIOD

Why didnt you tell me

I think I already knew the answer though PERIOD It wasnt that she wanted to conceal this part of her life  the Brad Paisley CDs the cowboy boots the Garth Brooks concerts  or that she was embarrassed about it in the slightest PERIOD Her reservation lay more in the fact that I was a judgmental jerk  and honestly if I were her I wouldnt have told me either PERIOD

Up until that point and admittedly some time after country was one of those other genres of music something dirty and unrelatable that defined its listener in a way no genre of music could PERIOD You can listen to indie hip hop jazz and bluegrass and just be someone who enjoys music but if you like country thats it  youre a country listener. and country listener was a foreign category of person that I was sure I couldnt relate to whose only prerequisites were interest in the CMA Awards and knowing the words to at least one Keith Urban chorus PERIOD

But all of this was arbitrary as was my contempt for country in the first place PERIOD There was nothing inherently bad about the music yet I was building walls and bitter judgments between myself and something I didnt know the first thing about PERIOD

We listened to a lot of country music together that summer and while I was reluctant at the beginning Ill be the first to admit that I almost enjoyed some of it PERIOD It wasnt my genre of choice by any means but it wasnt the antiChrist of the music world either   I eventually learned the words to Red Solo Cup swayed to the pensive keyboard keys in Kenny Chesneys Come Over and hesitantly tapped my toe to Greg Batess Did It for the Girl. and I barely flinched when three weeks later my mom admitted to being a country fan too PERIOD

Because you know what Once you swallow the fiddles and twang  along with your own music elitism  country isnt all that bad PERIOD

Just dont tell anyone Im saying this PERIOD
