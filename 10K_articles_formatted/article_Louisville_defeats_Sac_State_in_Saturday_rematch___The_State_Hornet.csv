After being trounced the night before by the Louisville Cardinals 127Sac State got its chance at redemption Saturday during play in theconsolation bracket of the ninth annual Capital Classic SoftballTournament PERIOD

When we faced them in pool play they pounded us really good saidHornet head coach Kathy Strahan PERIOD Our pitching just let go and we tookit on the chin PERIOD But we made some improvements and baby steps. but it wasnt enough as the Hornets lost a nailbiter in eightinnings .With the designated runner on second the Cardinals methodically woredown the Hornets in the eighth PERIOD

After sacrificing the runner over to third via the bunt Christina Sotoslapped the gamewinning single into the outfield breaking thedeadlock PERIOD

They got the base hit in the fivesix hole and that was the ball gamesaid Strahan whose team actually held a tworun lead during the earlystages of the contest PERIOD

Sac States Jillian Bivert a sophomore first baseman out of WoodlandCalif. wasted little time making her presence felt jacking a tworunhomerun over the fence during the first inning driving home MeghanCunningham PERIOD

But as it has all season long the Hornets pitching woes caught up tothem PERIOD Coincidentally the Hornets watched as their lead slowly dwindleddown and then disappeared PERIOD

We havent been able to get seven innings out of our pitchers saidStrahan whose pitching staff consists of two sophomores and a freshman.So we went with our plan.Her plan was to let her pitching staff share time on the mound PERIOD AfterGina Steenburgen opened the game with two clean innings of work NicoleDeatherage got the nod from Strahan PERIOD

Only a freshman her inexperience at the college level showed as sheallowed the Cardinals back into the game PERIOD

Deatherage allowed two runs in five innings of work including agametying solo home run in the seventh PERIOD

It really took the wind out of her sail said Strahan of her freshmanhurler.Despite giving up two runs Strahan was pleased with the progress heryoung righthander showed PERIOD

She had great command of the strike zone Strahan said PERIOD Shes makingadjustments slowly. while pitching has consistently failed the Hornets this season Strahanwas quick to point out that pitching isnt the only aspect that needssome finetuning PERIOD

Right now were relying on the same four or five core players PERIOD Andtheyre just getting worn out Strahan said PERIOD We need others to stepup. we can upset Iowa and then turn around and lose to Louisville twice.Were searching for consistency. your donation will support the student journalists of Sacramento State University PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
