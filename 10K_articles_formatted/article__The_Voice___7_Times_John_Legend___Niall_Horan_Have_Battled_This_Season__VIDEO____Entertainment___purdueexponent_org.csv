Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The Voice coach Blake Shelton has sadly left the show but what we are even more upset about is the fact that his rivalry with coach Niall Horan has come to an end PERIOD However a new fire has quickly sparked in Season  between Horan and fellow coach John Legend PERIOD

Horan won his first season as a coach on The Voice in Season  with singer Gina Miles PERIOD It seems that Horan now has a hot head this season and Legend is not liking it PERIOD While the fighting all seems to be in good fun Legend and Horan have hashed it out plenty of times so far on the show PERIOD

Season  is currently in the Battle rounds and in the most recent episodes we saw contestants Calla Prejean JaRae Womack Sophia Hoffman and Talaki get eliminated PERIOD That leaves Team Legend Team Niall and Team Reba all with eleven contestants and Team Gwen with thirteen PERIOD This season is just halfway through so the fighting has just begun PERIOD Below are some highlights of the duos feuding moments PERIOD



Contestant Mara Justine wowed the judges in the Season  premiere PERIOD While all four chairs were turned the fight was only between Horan and Legend  so much so that as you can see at the  mark in the video above Horan pressed his button and down came a Pick Niall foam finger PERIOD Legend quickly rose from his chair and sang a duet with Justine to All of Me PERIOD Horan could only stand and watch in defeat PERIOD



In Season  Horan finished his first run strong with a win PERIOD While he was still gloating Legend was not amused PERIOD Horan came on stage to We Are the Champions holding a champion belt while Legend sat and glared at the obnoxious entrance PERIOD



Singer Stee got a fourchair turn but Horan was quickly blocked by Legend who greatly enjoyed Horans helplessness in the situation the other coaches were relieved to have one less chair PERIOD Youve got a vendetta against me Horan said PERIOD



After Horan grieved the loss of Stee as a team member he decided to challenge Legend in a quick game of TicTacToe PERIOD Legend gladly accepted this challenge and they bickered while playing PERIOD Legend might have blocked him but Horan came back strong with a win here PERIOD



And the blocking continued This time Horan used it against Legend keeping him from singer Rudi Gutierrez as you can see at the  mark in the video above PERIOD At the end of her performance Legend and Horan met on the stage to playfight it out PERIOD Legend was not too happy about losing this one but Horan definitely got his revenge PERIOD



The fourchair turners seem to get Legend and Horan in the battling mood PERIOD Singer Nini Iris wooed the coaches but Horan put out all the stops to get her on his team as you can see at the  mark in the video above PERIOD Iris is a former One Direction fan so Horan was at an advantage but Legend did everything he could to convince her to stray away from Team Niall PERIOD



Legend was just about done with Horan as he kicked around the Team Niall sweatshirt PERIOD He referred to him as the Rambling Man which was really just a nice way of saying he doesnt shut up PERIOD Legend knows the ladies swoon of Horan and he is starting to get quite sick of it PERIOD
