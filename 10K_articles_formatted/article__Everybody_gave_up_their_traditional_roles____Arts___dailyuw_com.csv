Odds are if youve never heard of Death Cab for Cutie you probably havent been at the UW all that long PERIOD Born from the musical womb that is Western Washington University the emopop quartet has since gone on to garner underground acclaim among collegeage listeners nationwide PERIOD Bassist Nick Harmer isnt sure what the secret to success is but he does know that the groups fourth fulllength album Transatlanticism has played with the formula a bit PERIOD

 said Harmer PERIOD 

Also thrown into the mix this time around is longtime friend and drummer Jason McGerr PERIOD  said Harmer PERIOD 

While longtime fans of the smooth sentimental ballads that have become the bands trademark will undoubtedly find much to love in the new disk surprises like the monolithic distorted guitars in  and  have many asking whether the pop band is going rock PERIOD

 said Harmer PERIOD 

Despite the groups musical evolution and the surprising success of  on mainstream radio Death Cab connoisseurs need not worry about a sudden influx of trendy fans PERIOD

 said Harmer  Of course Harmer maintains 

Big surprise  limited by the financial restrictions of Seattle indie label Barsuk the sudden surge of enthusiasm has allowed Death Cab neverbeforeimagined luxuries PERIOD For the first time in its sevenyear career the group is able to afford its own tour manager sound technician and bus PERIOD Has such fiscal freedom turned the band into a group of prima donnas

 said Harmer PERIOD  His enthusiasm mounted as he said
