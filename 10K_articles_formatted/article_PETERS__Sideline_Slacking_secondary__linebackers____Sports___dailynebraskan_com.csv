Strap in PERIOD

After the Blackshirts abysmal showing against UCLA Husker Nation is full of heartache and the reason why is obvious PERIOD

Theyre playing twohand touch PERIOD

Nebraskas defenders were in good position to make plays the entire game but couldnt follow through and finish tackles PERIOD Fundamental form seemed alien to most players PERIOD

So why didnt NU coach Bo Pelini do something about it

Sean Fisher Nebraskas top reserve linebacker a senior who has starting experience and is as smart a player as they make them played one snap on defense all game PERIOD Meanwhile linebackers Alonzo Whaley and Will Compton were whiffing it up with arm tackles and poor footwork playing nearly every snap of the game PERIOD

Take em out Bo PERIOD

In fact the only position that saw reasonable rotation at all was the defensive line and even then the defensive ends who missed a slew of tackles still played almost every down PERIOD

The secondary saw virtually no rotation with Stanley JeanBaptiste and Harvey Jackson as the only subs who saw significant time but they are a normal part of the player rotation PERIOD

The Huskers didnt give their second stringers any playing time PERIOD They wouldnt take players out of the game after a poor attempt at a tackle PERIOD

Nebraskas coaches werent holding their players accountable PERIOD

In the fourth quarter with about  left to play UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley dumped a pass off to running back Johnathan Franklin in the left flat PERIOD The play should have been blown up by a clump of white jerseys PERIOD

Instead Franklin tore through a weak tackle PERIOD He danced around another two NU defenders PERIOD Then a few more PERIOD Five missed tackles and  yards later Franklin found himself at the Nebraska  yard line setting UCLA up for what would prove to be the gameclinching touchdown PERIOD

It all could have been prevented with a simple finished tackle PERIOD

Instead players opted to shove Bruins players rather than wrap them up PERIOD All the while those players remained on the game seemingly without many repercussions for their actions PERIOD

Im sure theyll run laps at practice PERIOD But is that enough

Take them out make a statement PERIOD Put in backups walkons freshmen  do whatever you have to do to show these players it isnt OK to miss tackles PERIOD This is not a problem that will take care of itself PERIOD

If Nebraska is trying to get over the hump and into a conference championship game this is no way to go about doing it PERIOD Bo traditionally known as a disciplinarian needs to live up to the hype and make his players feel the pain Husker fans felt Saturday they have to sit PERIOD

Had it not been for Hundley kneeling the ball for a 5yard loss on the final drive this game would have been the worst defensive showing in terms of yards alltime for Nebraska PERIOD Something has to be done PERIOD

If I were Bo I would tell my players this week in practice that if they miss a tackle they sit for the rest of the drive no excuses PERIOD Arkansas State next weeks opponent should be easy enough opponent Nebraska can afford to sit players out PERIOD

Two games in Nebraskas defense already looks lost PERIOD UCLAs offense exceeded expectations but its safe to say other Big Ten offenses can compare PERIOD

If this problem isnt fixed in the coming weeks the road ahead is going to be a rocky one PERIOD

Hold on tight PERIOD
