By  David KirkpatrickSeptember  

The continuing mistrust between the United States and the Soviet Union along with the Reagan Administrations commitment to Star Wars are two obstacles that stand in the way of further nuclear arms reductions between the two countries PERIOD

This message was conveyed by arms control advocate and former Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty chief negotiator Robert Earle II during his visit to NIU this week PERIOD

Earle said this is an exciting time for arms control PERIOD However he stressed the fact that many problems need to be addressed before any real progress can be made PERIOD

Arms control will not save the world but it should be advocated Earle said PERIOD He also said it should be a vital part of the next U.S PERIOD presidents national security and foreign policies PERIOD Earle added jokingly One nuclear bomb can ruin your entire life. earle lectured at NIU on Wednesday focusing on the arms control issue and fielding questions from an audience of more than  people PERIOD His visit was made possible by an award given to NIU from the Herbert Scoville Jr PERIOD Lecture series PERIOD

Herbert Scoville was president of The Arms Control Association and devoted his career to reducing the threat of nuclear war PERIOD

Depending upon who wins the presidential election in November the U.S PERIOD could follow one of two directions in the nuclear arms race Earle said PERIOD

The Soviets according to Earle would probably prefer Democrat Michael Dukakis to be elected because of his stance on the Strategic Defense Initiative SDI or Star Wars PERIOD

Dukakis has said that he might support continued research into SDI but his stance is not as hardline as Vice President George Bushs PERIOD Dukakis has favored eliminating the program in the past PERIOD Bush has shifted from being a skeptic of the program to supporting research testing and possible deployment PERIOD

The approach of Dukakis is much more suitable to the approach of the Soviets Earle said PERIOD However the Soviets have not ratified an arms control treaty with a Democratic president since . earle said he believes the major stumbling block between U.S PERIOD and Soviet arms negotiations is SDI PERIOD He also said that in his opinion protection from nuclear war in space is a fantasy. if we deploy a defense system in space to protect ourselves from offensive weapons launched from the Soviet Union we are opening a brand new door to a whole new arms race PERIOD

The Soviets would increase their supply of offensive weapons we would increase our supply of offensive weapons and a pattern of action and reaction would prevent any side from winning. earle said that presently the U.S PERIOD and the Soviet Union are at a military standoff PERIOD Though the U.S PERIOD can deliver more than  nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union and the Soviets can deliver an excess of  to our continent we bilaterally remain equal because the weapons harbored in Soviet silos submarines and bombers are bigger PERIOD

Earle also emphasized the fact that mutual trust between the superpowers is virtually impossible PERIOD

They mistrust us to the hilt Earle said PERIOD And we mistrust them. historically Earle said the Soviets have mistrusted the U.S PERIOD since  when American forces helped invade the Soviet Union to put down Bolshevik power PERIOD

We helped the British and the French in an unsuccessful invasion of their country PERIOD We have nuclear missiles sitting right on their border in Turkey PERIOD We have aircraft carriers in the seas around their country PERIOD Those are reasons why they dont trust us. earle added that American and Soviet mistrust is mutual PERIOD

In order to help reduce the amount of mistrust and confusion that surfaces in times of crisis between the two nations Earle said he hopes to find support in Washington D.C. for risk reduction centers in both countries PERIOD

By establishing a 24hour center in Moscow and Washington both of us can have instant access to the other when a lowscale crisis such as an airliner flying into restricted airspace occurs Earle said. advertisement
