One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom





Poet Emma Lazaruss words displayed on the Statue of Liberty will likely be remembered for decades to come PERIOD The text of her poem The New Colossus which experts have praised for both its poise and defiance ends with an iconic powerful call to action  Give me your tired your poor  Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free  The wretched refuse of your teeming shore PERIOD  Send these the homeless tempesttost to me  I lift my lamp beside the golden door 

While speaking to NPRs Morning Edition to announce a new immigration regulation Ken Cuccinelli acting Director of U.S PERIOD Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS suggested in a smirking aside to Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge. no one has a right to become an American who isnt born here as an American said Cuccinelli director of the agency primarily responsible for immigration and citizenship applications in the United States PERIOD Many in immigration policy circles have been attentive to the recent Supreme Court ruling about Cuccinellis proposed public charge rule that has restricted legal immigration in the U.S PERIOD Put simply the public charge rule renders an individual ineligible for permanent legal residence status also known as a green card or LPR if they receive inkind i.e. noncash government assistance such as Medicaid housing vouchers or food stamps PERIOD For some perhaps the logic seems intuitive enough Given that government assistance is funded by taxpayers the cost of thousands of immigrants qualifying and receiving welfare every year would be enormous for U.S PERIOD citizens PERIOD Please do note that noncitizens also do pay taxes and that is often a condition to receive LPR PERIOD

The reality is that there are already fairly restrictive guidelines in place that determine who can and cannot obtain legal permanent residence in the U.S PERIOD To have a decent chance at legal permanent residency immigrants need to produce an affidavit of support that indicates they or a close relative who is already a citizen earns a steady substantial income PERIOD And thats just one example  there are many biometric screening procedures in place to confirm that immigrants or their families are considered adequate for legal permanent residence PERIOD

Now under the new public charge regulation an immigrant who has received assistance within  months three years of applying for legal permanent residence or seems likely to receive assistance at some point in the future will be ineligible PERIOD For example a single mother who receives government benefits while she searches for employment in the U.S. secures a job and then applies for legal permanent residence would be ineligible even if she or her children never received government assistance ever again PERIOD

Many supporters of the new regulation insist that the regulation is only an extension of prior policy PERIOD Prior to the new USCIS regulation immigration officials did not typically enforce the public charge rule as it was difficult to assess what it meant for somebody to be likely to receive assistance and the rule seemed fairly counterintuitive PERIOD After all many immigrants come to the U.S PERIOD in search of better employment housing or education opportunities than in their home countries PERIOD Some immigrants who flee the social or political conditions in their home countries may be unable to take forms of material wealth with them into the U.S. and its unreasonable to assume that everyone should have the means to make it in America immediately upon arriving PERIOD

It is also worth noting that overarching regulations and bans are unprecedented in American immigration law PERIOD Both President Jimmy Carters Iran order and President Ronald Reagans Cuba proclamation which invoked the need for a national securitybased limit on immigration visas adopted a casebycase approach PERIOD In the dissenting opinion in Trump v PERIOD Hawaii Justice Stephen Breyer pondered  if those two Presidents thought a casebycase exemption system appropriate what is different about present circumstances that would justify that systems absence

It is important to call out the new regulation for exactly what it is PERIOD The new public charge rule sends the message that immigrants are only welcome if they can come to the U.S PERIOD with substantial means and resources which is both disconnected from reality and socially irresponsible PERIOD Public health experts are also worried that the new rule wont limit immigration flows into the U.S PERIOD but rather convince immigrants to stop seeking healthcare through Medicaid or other public health benefits PERIOD

This past weekend an abandoned dump trailer filled with dirt in Texas was found to contain  immigrants inside hidden beneath layers of gravel and sand PERIOD The people hidden inside had crossed the border illegally police concluded but it was unclear when or where PERIOD In the articles describing the discovery of the trailer the immigrants in question are nameless huddled together in a grassy space that could be anywhere PERIOD I wonder if Cuccinelli who had never worked at USCIS before being promoted to acting director in  has ever thought about what it must feel like to feel so unsafe in your own country that you would do anything to leave PERIOD I also wonder if Ian Smith an immigration analyst at the Department of Homeland Security who helped architect the public charge regulation and recently resigned when it was discovered he had clear ties to white nationalist groups and used derogatory language towards Jewish people thinks that all immigrants are poor tired and huddled masses covered in dirt PERIOD

If we hark back to Lazaruss words on Lady Liberty it is apparent that current immigration policy does not represent the poets values inscribed on the U.S.s most recognizable monument PERIOD We have in some profound way abandoned the lamp beside the golden door PERIOD
