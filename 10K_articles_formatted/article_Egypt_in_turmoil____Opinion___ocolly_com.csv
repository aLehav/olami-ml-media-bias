For  years the Arab Republic of Egypt has been under  allowing the government to expand its police powers while suspending constitutional rights and censoring the media PERIOD The autocratic Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak has retained office for the same amount of time despite protests from the population PERIOD

But this weekend the Egyptian people made it known that theyve had enough PERIOD Thousands took to the streets in large cities like Cairo Alexandria and Suez calling on Mubarak to resign and allow a new government to form PERIOD

On Friday the world was stunned when Egypts four main Internet service providers were instructed by the government to cease their services leaving nearly the entire country without Internet access PERIOD The government also instructed cell phone companies to cut off their services rendering mobile devices almost useless PERIOD

As police stations were set on fire in response to the governments actions OSU student Mohammed Aboustait an international student from Egypt was anxiously awaiting any news available PERIOD

 Aboustait said PERIOD 

Aboustaits family lives in Cairo in an apartment near a mosque where opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei was praying on Friday PERIOD

 Aboustait said PERIOD 

Mubarak has long been supported by the United States but its time for that to change PERIOD There have been suspicions that Mubaraks reelections throughout the years were fraudulent PERIOD

 said Aboustait PERIOD 

Under Mubarak Egypt has declined needlessly PERIOD Its literacy rate is  percent and its currency exchange rate has plummeted PERIOD

 said Aboustait PERIOD 

Although it may be a kneejerk reaction for Americans to want to intervene Aboustait said this may be the worst possible answer PERIOD

 said Aboustait PERIOD 

The best way we as Americans can help Egypt in its struggle for liberty is to remain concerned PERIOD Keep your eyes and ears on the situation PERIOD If you know a student from Egypt let them know that youre paying attention PERIOD If youre religious pray for their friends and family and for the brave men and women who have taken a stand against an oppressive government PERIOD

And as Aboustait said always keep in mind Americas own struggle for freedom PERIOD

 said Aboustait PERIOD
