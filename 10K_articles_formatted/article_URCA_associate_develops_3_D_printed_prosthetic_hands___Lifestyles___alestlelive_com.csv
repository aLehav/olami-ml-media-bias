Senior mechatronics and robotics engineering major Logan Sherrill of Edwardsville shows the capabilities of his robotic arm Tuesday May  in the Stratton Quadrangle PERIOD Sherrills robotic arm has two functions hold and mimic with eight gestures PERIOD The project was funded by the Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities Program PERIOD

SIUE Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities Associate Logan Sherrill has been working this past year on his research project about the construction of robotic prosthetic hands and the most productive and inexpensive way to create one PERIOD

The URCA program is an opportunity for undergraduates to get involved and gain experience in research in their specific fields PERIOD Many students in URCA start off assisting professors in their ongoing research projects PERIOD This is how Sherrill got started on research earlier in his undergraduate career PERIOD

Sherrill signed up to be an assistant for mechanical engineering professor Mingshao Zhang then Sherrill approached him with a project idea PERIOD

Zhang pushed Sherrill to write a proposal because he thought Sherrill had a good shot at being chosen as an URCA associate with his project Construction of robotic prosthetic hand through lower arm muscle recognition. his proposal had a very appealing title and the idea is very attractive to people Zhang said PERIOD

Through research and talking with doctors Schrill decided to use sensors to measure the resistance of muscles PERIOD

Muscles are highly resistive when theyre in a base state PERIOD They become less resistive when theyre active and thats because they emit electricity themselves Sherill said PERIOD The sensors pick up on that change in resistance. the next step in Sherrills research was designing the hand PERIOD

Ive always wanted to make a career or living out of helping people whove either lost limbs or with limited mobility by either building robotic prosthetics or exoskeleton robotic suits PERIOD Thats just something Ive been in love with my whole life Sherrill said PERIOD

Sherrill said his interest in prosthetics started while playing video games as a child PERIOD

When I was really young I used to play Halo with my cousin PERIOD From there I was obsessed and read all the books and did a lot of indepth research about that Sherrill said PERIOD Something that was always so awesome to me was that the main character of the game and books is a genetically altered human being but hes in this exoskeleton armor that essentially helps him move faster be stronger. he chose to 3D print the hand in attempts to keep the expenses low PERIOD He added that 3D printing materials are actually fairly strong PERIOD Sherrill said a human hand doesnt do anything too strenuous that these materials wouldnt be able to withstand PERIOD

To make sure the hand works properly Sherrill said he kept four criteria in mind PERIOD He wanted to make sure the hand was a proper size the motor could properly fit in the model the hand had solid rods to ensure efficient movement and that the hand had functional movements PERIOD

Sherrill said he went to a company that makes high quality but expensive prosthetic hands PERIOD He used their concept as a guide for his new design PERIOD He used their design to move the motors to the front of the hand instead of the back to make the hand close more efficiently PERIOD

He also got rid of the third joint the joint at the top of the finger and made the second and third joint function as one unit PERIOD He had the third joint slightly bent eventually allowing him to remove a rod from the hand PERIOD

Essentially I was able to maintain my design while simplifying it and increasing its functionality PERIOD Plus it looks a lot more like a human hand Sherrill said PERIOD

Being able to make the hand close efficiently was part of Sherrills fourth and final criteria the functionality of the hand PERIOD He decided to model the hand after his own PERIOD He addressed the almost limitless gestures you can make with your hand PERIOD He chose  gestures that allowed the hand to be used in multiple ways PERIOD

I took pictures of different gestures I could make with my own hand because I needed to determine a set of gestures that I wanted the hand to be able to perform he said PERIOD

The company with the nice but expensive prosthetic hands gave inspiration to Sherrill not only in terms of his design but in terms of his whole purpose PERIOD

I went to a company that makes a really nice robotic hand PERIOD Its a prosthetic but  is how much this hand costs PERIOD I dont know how they expect people to make that kind of money when they dont even have a hand Sherrill said PERIOD I was able to make something that gives you eight different hand gestures for less than . according to costhelper.com for patients without health insurance a prosthetic arm costs anywhere between  to  PERIOD Arms around  are typically only for cosmetic purposes PERIOD They are simply an artificial hand that has no functionality PERIOD The arms costing  are advanced arms controlled by muscle movements PERIOD Sherrills hands are doing similar things for a much lower cost PERIOD

Hes proposing a low cost PERIOD Everything was 3D printed all the components were off the shelf Zhang said PERIOD This means theoretically speaking it can actually be an affordable hand for a lot of people who say dont have healthcare. all of this wasnt put together on the first attempt PERIOD Sherrill has two hands featured in his project after going through a redesign process PERIOD Between these two versions he went through eight hands to find two he is happy with PERIOD Sherrill created most of his hands before even beginning the URCA program and his URCA stipend was only spent on the later versions PERIOD

Next year Sherrill will be in senior design PERIOD After consulting with Zhang he decided for his senior design project hell be working on prosthetics for people who have lost their limbs from the elbow down PERIOD

Theres a great deal more people who have lost from the elbow down or midbicep down PERIOD I cant do anything for those people with what I have accomplished here because your forearm muscles stop at your elbow Sherrill said PERIOD
