391,2023-10-23,"the work of Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD inspired Carlos Munoz as a youth to fight for Hispanic rights in the Southwest PERIOD 
Even though Munoz part of the country was different from the Deep South Munoz was still able to find guidance and inspiration in Kings life PERIOD
Yesterday Munoz told a packed Union Ballroom that Kings life can still guide and inspire us today in fighting for civil rights in twenty-first century America PERIOD
In Martin Luther Kings era African Americans and many other ethnic groups were excluded from many societal institutions PERIOD The infamous segregation on buses and in restaurants was a daily reminder that not all Americans valued racial equality PERIOD
Whiteonly schools churches and social clubs were everywhere PERIOD When King and many others protested these injustices they were met with violence and incarceration PERIOD
Because of the civilrights movement there are no laws protecting racial segregation PERIOD There are no laws institutionalizing racial injustice PERIOD
Thanks to civilrights activists the U is able to enjoy diversity of race ethnicity gender religion and ideas in our classrooms PERIOD
Although huge successes have been made in the last  years this does not mean that racial segregation and injustice is gone from the United States PERIOD
Speaking of civilrights issues that still need improvement Munoz mentioned the war in Iraq affirmative action and universal health care PERIOD
While the issues King battled were clearly about race discrimination the role of race in current societal problems is less obvious PERIOD
Inviting Munoz to campus allowed the U community to grapple with the status of civilrights today PERIOD
As in Kings day not everyone is going to agree on the best way to propagate social issue PERIOD 
War health care and affirmative action inspire fierce debate among Americans PERIOD 
But debate over how these issues affect civilrights is in that the real value of bringing speakers like Munoz to campus PERIOD
What should be done about the disproportionate number of African Americans and Hispanics in todays military 
What should be done about our countrys selfsegregated neighborhoods
How should the U address the segregation that occurs within student clubs and organization
These are questions that are just as important to the health of todays society as the issues King grappled with in his day PERIOD
These questions need to be revisited constantly not just once every January PERIOD
