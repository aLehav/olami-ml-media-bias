A decision on the jury trial for a nearly twoyear long civil lawsuit against Andrew Shirvell for defaming and stalking University alum Chris Armstong has been postponed for at least one more day as the jury has yet to come to a decision PERIOD

The alleged stalking and defamation originated in  when Armstrong served as the first openly gay president of the University student government  known then as the Michigan Student Assembly PERIOD

Shirvell a Michigan assistant attorney general at that time started a blog criticizing and accusing Armstrong of having a radical homosexual agenda before being fired for those actions PERIOD

The spectacle eventually reached a national audience when it landed Shirvell on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and Armstrong on Anderson Cooper  PERIOD

The jury trial that was held Wednesday which has now stretched into Thursday is to finally end the suit filed by Armstrong against Shirvell  withholding the possibility of an appeal by Shirvell PERIOD

During the trial Shirvell called himself to the witness stand and proceeded to ask himself questions in the third person PERIOD

My blog was political speech Shirvell said as he testified according to the Detroit Free Press PERIOD I viewed my blog as a movement to get Mr PERIOD Armstrong to resign PERIOD I personally felt Mr PERIOD Armstrong was too radical for the position. armstrongs lawyer Deborah Gordon said she had not seen anything like this in a courtroom before and that he could have just given a narrative instead PERIOD

I hope to never see it again she added PERIOD It was odd. following that Gordon said she crossexamined Shirvell and both parties made closing statements PERIOD

Overall Gordon said she was confident in the case made against Shirvell PERIOD

He has a 100page blog and every page is lies PERIOD He did not come in to trial with any evidence to counter our contention that theyre lies she said PERIOD He did not call a single witness to the witness stand  except for himself. that Shirvell called no witnesses aside from himself was a rare occurrence Gordon said PERIOD

Thats unusual she said PERIOD Ive never been in a case where theres no witnesses called by the other side. while this jury trial could be the end of this iteration of the ongoing legal struggles between Shirvell and Armstrong Gordon said she sees no end to the multiple years of litigation that have already passed PERIOD

Its not going to come to a close PERIOD Its going to be appealed she said PERIOD Mr PERIOD Shirvell doesnt know when to quit. the jury will reconvene on Thursday at  a.m. but its possible that a verdict may not be reached by then Gordon said PERIOD
