Why Guns N Roses needs a new album

Something magical occurred when Irish musician Glen Hansard and Czech vocalist and pianist Markta Irglov stepped foot in front of a soldout crowd at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on Jan PERIOD . there was no elaborate set or screens set up to show the folk duo closeup for those in the third mezzanine PERIOD Despite housing approximately  concertgoers Radio City felt intimate and the duo known as The Swell Season purposely kept it that way PERIOD Hansard and Irglov are the Oscarwinning singers and songwriters of Falling Slowly from the  Irish indie film Once. hansard and Irglov have dated and since broken up which made the songs they performed all the more effective and somber yet slightly hopeful for the future PERIOD One member of the audience brazenly said as much yelling for the two to get back together following their sweeping performance of Falling Slowly during the encore. singersongwriter Josh Ritter opened for Hansard and Irglov PERIOD Ritters folk and countrytinged stylings proved to be quite the way to start the evenings proceedings PERIOD Even though Ritter only appeared on stage for a halfhour he more than made up for the limited time through his smooth vocal performance and quirky stage presence PERIOD Ritter was eternally grateful for the break to play a packed house and have his music heard for many prospective fans PERIOD

The Swell Season finally began their set after  p.m PERIOD and the two were well worth the wait PERIOD Despite the fact that the two are no longer dating the songs and their performances still contained a slowburn of passion and quiet restraint that lingered from the insides of their bodies and out from their lips PERIOD Hansard could have melted Radio City Music Hall down all by himself when he segued from The Swell Seasons Low Rising into Marvin Gayes Sexual Healing. in addition to Gaye The Swell Season covered songs from Van Morrison and Bruce Springsteen PERIOD During their cover of Springsteens Drive All Night The Swell Season was joined by Jake Clemons who played the only brass instrument of the night the saxophone PERIOD

One of the more emotionally stirring moments of the evening occurred when Hansard told the audience about a woman named Lois he met in Chicago PERIOD Like many Lois was unfamiliar with Hansard and The Swell Season PERIOD Hansard spoke a little bit about himself when Lois almost stopped him short PERIOD Her eyes began to well up as she mentioned that her son was Hansards age when he was in the World Trade Center on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD She had a bad feeling that morning but never had the opportunity to tell her son to not go into work PERIOD Hansard often thinks of Lois and her devastating predicament. because of Lois he encouraged the audience to not hold back anything to anyone and say what is on your mind because you dont want to regret any missed chances PERIOD

Hansard and Irglov were joined on stage for the majority of the evening by the Frames Hansards band before he met Irglov PERIOD The chemistry on stage between all of the musicians was on point and they shared a genuine respect for one another PERIOD Hansard and Irglov were humble and gracious they did not seem like two people who had won Academy Awards or have been effected by success at all PERIOD

The Swell Season performed for well over two and a half hours and left the audience in a spellbound trance that only true wizards of music could have the capabilities of doing PERIOD
