The tile decorating contest was full of colorful designs as teams grabbed paintbrushes pencils and sponges to help decorate their ceiling tiles while dancing to the music PERIOD

Eagle Entertainment hosted the tile decorating contest on Oct PERIOD  which took place in PUB  PERIOD This event was overseen by Mike Cardenas Eagle Entertainment chair PERIOD

According to Stacey Reece the director of SAIL the tile decorating contest is part of the team challenge for Homecoming Week  PERIOD Reece said teams entered the contest to decorate new ceiling tiles representing their Eagle pride PERIOD

According to Reece this contest is a spinoff of the old window decorating competition PERIOD

We changed the format because often the weather would interfere with the painting of windows Reece said in an email PERIOD We also wanted to create artwork that could last and be used throughout the year. cardenas said this event is pretty relaxed when it comes to the rules and guidelines that allow students to express their artistic thoughts and feelings for Eastern PERIOD

The rules are pretty much to show your Eastern pride and try to incorporate your team PERIOD Some are from the residence halls some are from sororities and fraternities some are from clubs and organizations and I think there is actually one team that is just a group of friends that decided to do it this year said Cardenas PERIOD

Freshman Laura Holman and junior Erin Locke were part of the snyamncut Hall team PERIOD Holman said she enjoyed the contest because of the opportunity to be artistic PERIOD

I like it because its another way to get to know more people in your dorm or in your organization that youre with and you get to be creative with it which is really cool said Holman PERIOD

Locke and Holman designed their tile around the meaning of the word snyamncut PERIOD According to Holman snyamncut is a NativeAmerican word meaning gathering place. holman and Locke painted the word synamncut on their tile and drew the S so that it flowed into a river the river flowed into handprints that surround the Eastern Eagle PERIOD Holman said this design incorporates Eastern as well as their residence hall PERIOD

This is my first time ever doing this but so far its fun said Locke PERIOD

Unlike Locke and Holman on the synamncut team the EWU Competition Dance Team did not collaborate on their tile PERIOD According to the teams head captain Hope Morrow the team decided that one member would paint the tile because she was good at painting and the rest of the team would offer their unartistic moral support PERIOD

The judges are between Eagle Entertainment ASEWU and SAIL offices PERIOD The top three tiles will be hung in the ASEWU office PERIOD The winners will be announced at the homecoming game said Cardenas PERIOD

The contest lasted about two hours teams were standing sitting and dancing as they painted their tiles to represent their Eastern pride PERIOD

Well if this ceiling tile is going to hang up in the building for like a thousand years it is pretty legit PERIOD Its definitely our favorite PERIOD Its about leaving a legacy right said Morrow PERIOD
