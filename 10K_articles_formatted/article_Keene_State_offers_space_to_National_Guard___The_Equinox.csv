8401,2023-10-25,"the National Guard was on Keene States campus on Monday March  and Tuesday March  to set up an alternative care site at the college PERIOD

According to Keene Mayor George Hansel there is currently one alternative care site on campus but four others are ready to go if needed PERIOD

The alternative care facility will be located in the Keene State Recreation Center Gym Hansel said PERIOD Several other dorms around campus may be used to house first responders and healthcare workers PERIOD There is no current need for us to use any Keene State facilities for this emergency PERIOD The planning and setup of these options is precautionary. kSC President Melinda Treadwell said the other dorms on campus that may be used include Holloway One Butler Court Pondside One and the LLC PERIOD

KSC assisted with this process in more ways than just offering the space PERIOD

Along with providing facilities logistics and administrative support to this effort college administrators and staff have fully participated in the emergency planning process Hansel said PERIOD Ive always known that Keene State is a tremendous asset to the broader community. as for who will be using these emergency spaces if needed that decision is up to the Cheshire Medical Center PERIOD

Anyone treated in this facility would need to be referred by the Cheshire Medical Center campus PERIOD They will be Cheshire Medical patients PERIOD It is important to note that area hospitals work closely together to meet the needs of the entire community Hansel said PERIOD

These alternative care sites are precautionary and are not currently in active use PERIOD They are meant to serve essential healthcare personnel who are at risk and may need a location to stay while awaiting test results PERIOD They can serve up to  patients PERIOD

The goal there is for the employees who are supporting the alternate care sites to have space and then for the city and the county to have places where if any first responders are exposed and awaiting test results and need to be isolated that they would have space on our campus rather than in hotels Treadwell said PERIOD Were hoping again that the site never needs to go live and that no one needs to use our spaces but were certainly ready willing and able to support. vice President for Student Affairs Kemal Atkins is the KSC Incident Commander for the Colleges relationship with the City of Keene and the point of contact for KSCs participation on the Regional Pandemic Response Team PERIOD

We hope that we dont have to activate the site but are glad that were in a position to join in the effort to support our community if the need arises Atkins said PERIOD
