One of Iowas best defensive players of  wont be on the team this season PERIOD Amani Hooker was selected in the fourth round of the  NFL Draft by the Tennessee Titans leaving a void in the Hawkeye secondary PERIOD

Luckily for Iowa and not so luckily for opposing quarterbacks the position will be filled by Geno Stone PERIOD

Stone possesses impressive ball skills that can turn a game around and he made his mark when Hooker shuffled around the field to play a safetylinebacker hybrid PERIOD

Stone finished the  season tied for the team lead with  interceptions and scored his first touchdown with a Pick6 against Penn State on a 24yard return on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

He also made  stops defended  passes and forced a fumble PERIOD Now imagine his production in a full season in defensive coordinator Phil Parkers scheme PERIOD

Iowa will be perfectly fine at corner next season PERIOD Starters Michael Ojemudia and Matt Hankins both return and Riley Moss and Julius Brents  who both impressed observers when thrust into action  will also come back as more experienced sophomores PERIOD

Safety is where the Hawkeye secondary should get iffier but it doesnt because of Stone PERIOD Hooker and fellow starter Jake Gervase might be gone but they are being replaced by their prodigy PERIOD

Stone will become the quarterback of the defense PERIOD

Entering his junior season Stone finally has the experience  and the chance  to make the secondary his PERIOD He wont miss his opportunity PERIOD
