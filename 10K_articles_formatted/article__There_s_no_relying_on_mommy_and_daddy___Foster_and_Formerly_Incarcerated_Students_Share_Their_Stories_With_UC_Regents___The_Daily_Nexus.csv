4104,2019-11-19,"where I sleep and where I lay my head at night is my home PERIOD I dont have anywhere else to go said Rebeca Borges a thirdyear environmental economics and policy major from UC Berkeley PERIOD

Her audience during the Nov PERIOD  UC Board of Regents meeting was comprised of members from the Public Engagement and Development Committee who organized the discussion in order to hear from students within the UC system who were or still are in the foster care system or were formerly incarcerated PERIOD

Fourthyear sociology major McArthur Hoang a fellow student from UC Berkeley experienced both he said in the meeting PERIOD

Life is hard PERIOD Finding a place to live is hard he said PERIOD I slept on campus because I was too scared to go outside and look for housing as someone whos a foster and formerly incarcerated. surprise resonated on the Regents faces PERIOD

This is horrifying to hear Regent Sherry Lansing said PERIOD We should take action on this. resources such as the UC Santa Barbara Guardian Scholars Program GSP and Berkeley Underground Scholars exist throughout the UC system offering academic and career advising as well as scholarships for foster and formerly incarcerated students respectively PERIOD

But a lack of funding and outreach have limited their effectiveness Borges and Hoang said PERIOD

Borges elaborated on UC Berkeleys own version of GSP  Berkeley Hope Scholars BHS  as an example PERIOD While BHS does supply emergency housing to students when dorms are closed during holidays relatively few people know that they can apply for a space and so most are kicked out during winter break according to Borges who added that acceptance is limited and based on a lottery system PERIOD

As a result Borges said students are forced into the most inadequate offcampus housing with mold abusive or neglectful landlords and residents with little concern for their wellbeing PERIOD Securing more suitable arrangements would require parents to sign leases money to pay deposits and a family tax history  but as Hoang stated Theres no relying on mommy and daddy to get any of that. there is a potential recourse Borges said passed years ago California State Legislature bills AB1393 and AB1228 require the California Community Colleges and the California State University systems to give priority yearround housing to foster and homeless students PERIOD

But this requirement does not apply to the UC system until the Regents formally enact it into policy PERIOD And so far according to Borges they havent PERIOD

What Im here to ask she continued regarding the bills is to maybe put it on your radar. beyond housing Hoang proposed other changes that would benefit the foster and formerly incarcerated student population after graduation PERIOD

His recommendations included awarding fellowships to alumni to compensate for the extra hands resources and living space that parents would normally provide in an initial job search hiring more foster and formerly incarcerated people as employees of the UC system since they know best how to solve the problems that they themselves face every day and reevaluating the use of criminal background checks for certain jobs in the UC system PERIOD

Hoang said there is a combined approximate total of  foster and formerly incarcerated students at UC Berkeley based on the memberships of BHS and Berkeley Underground Scholars PERIOD However he pointed out that based on his research the true count includes an undetected number of about double that  by including those who do not wish to make their history known due to the potential stigma in doing so PERIOD

For their part the Regents appeared receptive to the presenters suggestions PERIOD I think those are recommendations we should seriously consider if we are truly committed to opening the doors to students who are not what we think of as a traditional student in the UC which is primarily becoming the majority of students in higher education now Regent Eloy Ortiz Oakley stated PERIOD

Some of the recommendations seemed to be nobrainers to me said Regent Christine Simmons who volunteered to head a task force to decide on short and longterm changes within the UC system while conferring with Borges Hoang UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol T PERIOD Christ and other students interested in voicing their feedback PERIOD

Highlighting the need for collaboration and communication to solve issues on a more fundamental level Lansing advised broadening the task force PERIOD It seems to me it shouldnt just be us implementing these recommendations  I think it should be the community colleges Cal State and obviously UC she added PERIOD

This is a crisis that we have to address. print
