As models designers bloggers socialites and photographers go to rest after a long week of shows and parties in New York City London is just beginning its own hectic schedule PERIOD Located at various venues such as the Somerset House the National Gallery and a venue Topshop has set up showgoers will watch the famous Cara Delevingne and GeorgiaMay Jagger as well as other beauties on

the catwalk PERIOD

Shows during New York Fashion Week were varied per usual with some designers really creating pieces that stood out PERIOD Take Opening Ceremony for instance this year was the first time the company put on a runway show PERIOD While the focus was not so much on the clothing or the couture the show had everyone in awe including Justin Bieber who surprised the crowd with his appearance PERIOD

Instead of using a normal catwalk as their format for the models to walk on the owners of the company Humberto Leon and Carol Lim were able to pull some strings to get their models driven into the large room the fashion show took place in a former shipping yard in Ferraris Lamborghinis Bentleys and Range Rovers PERIOD This was an idea that was previously unheard of but had the crowds attention for many reasons PERIOD Husbands accompanying their wives were surely not disappointed PERIOD

One could go on about the beauty and array of this seasons designs but a distinguishable difference seems to be a comfort for everyone PERIOD Between Birkenstocks on Eduns runway Nike Blazers and Flyers on the streets and Charlotte Olympia loafers on show attendees it is clear that some are realizing that stilettos and extreme wedges are no longer the way to go when they have places to be and people to see for eight days straight PERIOD Designers such as Alexander Wang and Reed Krakoff also put an emphasis on a sportier look for this upcoming season PERIOD

Wang who always sticks to pastel colors and basic silhouettes has done it again PERIOD Not only is he now seen as the king of branding having embedded his name very discretely into the clothing he showed boxing shorts with large overcoats versatile spaghetti strapped dresses tennis skirts and many flat shoes in his collection PERIOD While his clothing showcased a lot of choice for consumers his signature baggy look is one of comfort as well as high style all in one PERIOD

Reed Krakoff showed a different aspect of the idea of sportswear PERIOD His designs were a lot more feminine than Wangs PERIOD He decided to show very transparent and flowy clothing skirts pants and dresses were baggy and often long or midknee length PERIOD Before the show he explained his vision to Mark Holgate from Vogue as a more overt idea of femininity the idea of luxury sportswear is still relevant but I wanted it to come from a different place transparency and layering and asymmetry. needless to say both of these designers are artists PERIOD People from all over the globe continue to congregate at these shows in order to see what innovations designers have come up with PERIOD The idea of being comfortable is not a new one but perhaps the concept of luxury sportswear is a better term for

these looks PERIOD

Regardless they seem to be influencing style as women especially seem to be getting fed up with keeping a pair of flats in their pocketbooks or wearing dresses that suffocate them PERIOD We must now hold tight and watch what London has to show
