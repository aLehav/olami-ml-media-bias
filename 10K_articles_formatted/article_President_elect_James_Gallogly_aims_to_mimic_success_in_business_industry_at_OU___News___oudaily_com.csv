OU presidentelect James Gallogly speaks at the presidential announcement at the OU Health Sciences Center March  PERIOD

Nearly a decade ago James Gallogly left the company where he had built his successful 29year career in the oil business to take the helm at a corporation saddled with  billion of debt PERIOD

In front of an audience of LyondellBasells  employees he set forth the ruthless expectations that would later propel the company into Fortune  territory PERIOD

I spoke to an audience just like this in a video conference across the entire world where I said to them I did not come to help you get out of bankruptcy PERIOD I came to help you become the greatest petrochemical company in the world Gallogly said PERIOD And they did. in a similar move nine years later Gallogly now  will take the reins at Oklahomas largest public university where he aims to mimic his past success in the business world guided by a similar relentless perfectionism PERIOD

The path to greatness for LyondellBasell did not come without cost PERIOD In the process of transforming the company Gallogly oversaw  plant closures and  layoffs PERIOD While Gallogly clearly set his standards for university greatness at the presidential announcement March  he has yet to lay out an execution plan for OU to achieve its status as the pinnacle of higher education. we aspire to greatness  nothing less PERIOD I will push very hard PERIOD I will ask a great deal PERIOD We expect perfection and were going to have that same standard in every single thing we do at this university Gallogly said PERIOD Every single thing. its that same insatiable competitive spirit that has driven Gallogly to be the best from wrestling matches with his brothers to law school exams throughout his entire life said his mother Margery Gallogly PERIOD

Its a challenge and he likes a challenge Margery Gallogly said PERIOD So I think thats where thats coming from PERIOD Just like the LyondellBasell thing  the company was just so bad off and he had a really fantastic job with Conoco Philips and was vice president there  and yet he took that job knowing that it was going to be a challenge and not knowing if he could pull them out of the bankruptcy PERIOD But he really did a good job hes good at challenges. noma Gurich justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court recalls Gallogly as a smart focused and reserved student during the time they both attended OUs College of Law PERIOD

He seemed conservative and straightlaced not a wild personality or anything Gurich said PERIOD I think he went by Jimmy in those days PERIOD We were all just a little less formal then. still in a photo Gurich found in her yearbook she noticed Gallogly wearing a vest and tie amidst a group of peers dressed in far more casual attire PERIOD

Galloglys mildmannered personality was belied by a strong desire to be the best lawyer he said in his public speech to the OU community PERIOD

My father gave me fantastic advice PERIOD He said Okay if youre going to do this do it with great passion PERIOD Be the absolute best at it the greatest lawyer ever Gallogly said PERIOD Because there is always room at the top. gallogly has shared this drive for success with engineering students he has met in the past PERIOD Lisa Morales executive director of diversity and inclusion in OUs Gallogly College of Engineering said she and a group of students met with Gallogly at a conference through the college several years ago PERIOD

We met him down in Houston and he shared with our students kind of his story and a little bit of his background and most importantly encouraged our students to continue to work hard in school Morales said PERIOD He was very inspiring to our students as far as telling them their education is something that is valuable and he was positive about they choices in pursuing a degree in engineering PERIOD He did a great job of connecting with the students by sharing some of his personal stories PERIOD I just thought he was a very genuine and compassionate person. morales said she thinks Galloglys multimillion dollar donations to OUs Gallogly College of Engineering speak to his compassion for others PERIOD

I also think that just the investments hes personally made to the University of Oklahoma also send a message that he cares about the students and the faculty and he cares about everyone Morales said PERIOD

The new job as OUs president will bring Gallogly to Oklahoma where he has not lived since he first began his career in the oil industry in Bartlesville Oklahoma decades ago PERIOD Born on a military base in Canada Jim spent the first five years of his life moving from state to state including Alaska before settling down in Colorado Springs Colorado where he attended high school and college PERIOD

Galloglys career in the energy and oil sector has rooted him in the Oklahoma and Texas region but he maintains ties to his home state where he now owns both a ranch and a house in Colorado Springs PERIOD His extensive wealth also includes a ranch in Finley Oklahoma as well as several Ferraris and Porsches PERIOD

Aside from his extensive personal property Margery Gallogly said her son has used his massive amounts of wealth to support family members including saving a family ranch from going out of commission and helping provide college money for his  nieces and nephews PERIOD

I dont think it went to his head Margery Gallogly said PERIOD I think hes happy that he has it and yet sometimes hes very conservative which seems odd but hes generous with it PERIOD He wants to make sure that none of his siblings or nieces and nephews want of anything and hes been very generous. margery said Gallogly was raised to greatly value family and education two concepts she thinks he will bring with him to his role as president PERIOD

Education is extremely important to us Margery said PERIOD And we want everyone to succeed and this world would be a better place if everyone succeeded at education. when Gallogly called his mother to tell her he would be accepting the position as fourteenth president of the University of Oklahoma she had just one question for him PERIOD

I thought he was going to retire and I said Why cant you just retire Margery said she told her son PERIOD But he has something to give  he still has something to give. correction This story was updated at  a.m PERIOD to reflect the correct spelling of Margery Galloglys name in all instances of its use PERIOD This story was updated at  p.m PERIOD to reflect the correct number of employees for LyondellBasell PERIOD
