This is a response to the Photo Feature on the second page of
the Ka Leo Tuesday Dec PERIOD   edition  PERIOD

After reading the campus wide invitation to  at the second annual University of Hawaii at Mnoa
Campus Planning Day and being interested in our efforts toward a
sustainable campus I attended last weeks event in Campus
Ballroom PERIOD I met with three other students who stood toward the back
of the meeting PERIOD One student held a poster of his vision for UH and
the community PERIOD Another student sat on the floor with Linda Cox of
the NREM Department discussing student concerns and activities and
the ASUH Senate Resolution  Condemning Campus Security
Violence Against UH Students PERIOD The next day when I saw our student
paper failed to give students the full story I realized it would
have to come from the students involved PERIOD

I was thrown to see the feature photos description  on the second page of the next days Ka Leo PERIOD
A more accurate description of the featured photo would have read
 Understand that the students
were not rowdy but vocal demonstrative students PERIOD Chancellor Konan
did not quiet us PERIOD She approached us to address concerns and answer
questions PERIOD The caption 
accompanying the photo was similarly inaccurate PERIOD If the campus
security guards present took no action how were they required to


The words accompanying the photo ignored the students story PERIOD A
truer caption to the photo would not have mentioned campus
security but could have described the blurred wording of Michael
Bernardinis poster PERIOD Improved housing a green campus and rules
for campus security were among his top ten  for UH PERIOD
Instead of being blurred by the camera his concerns could have
been brought into focus by that caption PERIOD Many are unable to attend
events like Mondays PERIOD Those that saw only what was published
Tuesday would have an unreliable account of the event PERIOD

I attended the Planning Day to show administration that students
care PERIOD I was inspired by the awareness four students raised in four
hours PERIOD I made valuable connections with people of the Saunders Hall
Sustainability project PERIOD I am excited about the future about the
small steps others and I are taking to make this a Mnoa we want
to be a part of PERIOD I am proud to be one of the  students
because involvement is how you make improvement happen PERIOD The efforts
of the students involved in Campus Planning Day and others will
continue PERIOD I hope that Ka Leo will make a more concerted effort to
tell the whole story to raise awareness about student actions PERIOD
