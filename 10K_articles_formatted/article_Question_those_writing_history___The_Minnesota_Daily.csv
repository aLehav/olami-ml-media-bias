While addressing American troops in Qatar earlier this week Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld placed the recent military action in Iraq into the following historical context It will certainly take its place alongside the Berlin Wall the liberation of Paris PERIOD And each of you made that happen. while I do not doubt for a minute a good number of George W PERIOD Bush administration officials really believe the removal of Saddam Hussein from office is on the scale of World War II andor the Cold War Im not quite ready to edit the history books PERIOD I know a good number of Eastern Europeans who have seen the toppling of statues only to flee civil war and watch their cities destroyed PERIOD

Yet Rumsfelds strategy is straightforward and part of a much larger administration tactic regarding Iraq and Hussein PERIOD Even before the events on Sept PERIOD   measures were being taken to yank Iraq out of U.S PERIOD history and reposition it as we all know now in the axis of evil. interesting note on the term axis of evil  former Bush speechwriter David Frum originally coined the axis of hatred but head Bush speechwriter Mike Gerson preferred the word evil because it sounded more biblical PERIOD Even before the war began all 30plus days of it Iraq was no longer a former U.S PERIOD ally gone bad nor did previous U.S PERIOD presidential administrations have any involvement in the region PERIOD It was a smart move on the part of the Bush administration for the following reason More than any physical battle involving soldiers the real war will be how the definitive history describing the U.S PERIOD liberation of Iraq is written PERIOD

The story of whats taking place in Iraq proper and the entire Middle East region is a far from finished narrative with a great many things riding on the following items PERIOD Both Hussein and large quantities of biologicalchemical weapons need to be located PERIOD In the case of Hussein the Bush administration does not have the luxury of a bin Ladenesque specter lurking around caves in Afghanistan PERIOD To not find Hussein will only complicate an already unstable reconstruction process PERIOD As well until chemical and biological weapons are located not a barrel or two of something but the tons described by Bush in various speeches the already debilitated U.S PERIOD credibility abroad will largely selfdestruct PERIOD Finding antiquities from Iraqi museums and libraries would also be nice but I imagine the oil ministry still needs guarding PERIOD In no way am I saying the shift in power is doomed to fail in Iraq PERIOD On the contrary I really hope Bush administration officials understand what kind of project they have on their hands PERIOD When war becomes policy it means following through until the end PERIOD Actually I suggest all IraqiAmericans keep transcripts of the speech Bush made in Dearborn Mich. earlier this week about rebuilding Iraq because the promised partnership with Afghanis has not prospered as promised in the  State of the Union address PERIOD Perhaps thats just old history and I need to focus on the new history being written in Iraq PERIOD

So I return to the speech by Rumsfeld because in large part his placement of the events in Iraq may be written as a grand liberation PERIOD What the Bush administration has working for it is an American population unbelievably stupid when it comes to current events geography and most importantly history PERIOD Maybe stupid is too strong a word but I do believe that more Americans could tell me whom the finalists are on American Idol Nielsen ratings last week more than  million viewers for both nights versus where Kabul is andor why it is important to U.S PERIOD foreign policy PERIOD

I also imagine most Americans still cannot find Iraq or any country in the Middle East on a map PERIOD It seems unfair to begin asking people why the Iraqi National Congress and Ahmad Chalabi are important since our man casual Friday Jay Garner always wearing his Gap best is equally unknown PERIOD To be clear I am not playing favorites  the epidemic of stupidity cuts across all political agendas PERIOD And these problems will only compound as states such as Texas the largest consumer of textbooks in America next to California have difficulty finding money in the education budget to purchase history books for students PERIOD As goes Texas so goes the rest of the country when textbook publishers do not have the largest markets to sell their books PERIOD

Still I have a private hunch Rumsfelds writing of history will stick in the years to come PERIOD Last fall I began quizzing my students on various events in world history with a short answer test on the first day of class PERIOD Since I teach a course on the writing and reading of history it seemed fair to ask for example during what years the American Civil War was fought and what happened at Hiroshima PERIOD I also ask where the Berlin Wall was located and it is surprising to learn that the Berlin Wall iswas in China Israel and the former Yugoslavia to name a few locations PERIOD No kidding PERIOD Its even more disheartening to contemplate the number of students who do not know what happened at Hiroshima andor Nagasaki largely because their high school teachers never discussed the events PERIOD Rumsfelds assertion will succeed because vast numbers of Americans wont have a clue to know the difference PERIOD So goes the writing of history PERIOD

Over the last year and a half a number of Bush administration critics have lambasted what looks to be a new American empire growing by leaps and bounds PERIOD While I agree the current military occupation is largely colonialism by another name I see an empire in decline not ascension PERIOD The ability to sustain any kind of empire means having a population infrastructure capable of running the machinery of control PERIOD Both the infrastructure and the population are beginning to break down making the decline only a matter of time PERIOD Not soon but quicker than most people realize PERIOD The problem seems less about Americans not having the stomachs for foreign occupation rather we lack the brains to make it happen PERIOD In the event anybody thinks I am being cynical Im not PERIOD I am hopeful something good comes from the productive stupidity currently running the United States PERIOD Perhaps at some point in the writing of history a quiet historian will point out all the opportunities missed by a faux American empire reveling in mediocrity PERIOD I blame Sept PERIOD    its just easier that way PERIOD
