Ka Leo is a forum for all voices at the University of Hawaii PERIOD
We distribute breaking news movie reviews opinions and other
stories that are meant to educate our readers in all things related
to life at the university PERIOD So why cant we kick back and have fun
too

This is where the new column  comes into play PERIOD
Previously known as  the new column will be dedicated
to humor and nonsensical thoughts intended to entertain all
readers PERIOD The best part is that everyone at the university is
encouraged to participate PERIOD Contributing to the  is
free and requires only a university email address and a funny
comment message or thought PERIOD

We took the idea from the University of Wisconsins Badger
Herald which published 

The name of the column refers to the obscene but sometimesfunny
graffiti on bathroom walls or stalls but Ka Leos 
has more class PERIOD On this wall we want our readers to post more
complete and thoughtful comments about anything humorous PERIOD

For example a person running on a treadmill in the gym detects
a foul odor from a nearby exerciser PERIOD The detector might send this
comment to the  

Without naming names or being vulgar contributors can be candid
without fear of retaliation or hurting anothers feelings PERIOD However
the  is not a device to be used to insult people or
hurt reputations PERIOD

So please send any funny or absurd comments that could
entertain fellow readers to thewallkaleo.org PERIOD
