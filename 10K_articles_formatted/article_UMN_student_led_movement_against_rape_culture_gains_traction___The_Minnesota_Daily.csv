Students gather outside Cooke Hall for a UMN against Frats protest on Friday Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

by  Bella CarpentierPublished  September  

Editors note This article discusses sexual assault PERIOD If you or anyone you know has experienced sexual assault the Aurora Centers 24hour helpline can be reached at   PERIOD

Four years ago a group of student protesters marched down University Avenue also known as frat row to denounce rape culture and demand the University of Minnesota take action to stop sexual assault after a string of sexual assault reports occurred across University fraternities PERIOD

On Sept PERIOD  dozens of University students continued this legacy with a march starting from Cooke Hall and ending at the Phi Gamma Delta FIJI house led by recently formed student group UMN Against Frats PERIOD

The FIJI house was chosen as the end location of Fridays protest to show solidarity with the protests at the University of NebraskaLincoln UNL after a sexual assault was reported at its FIJI chapter PERIOD

With chants of All frats are FIJI protesters made their message clear they stand in solidarity with the protesters at UNL and victims of sexual assault at the University of Minnesota PERIOD

I think whats happening at the University of NebraskaLincoln is giving different schools momentum to continue this work said a representative of Abolish Greek Life UMN who asked to remain anonymous due to safety reasons PERIOD Unfortunately this isnt the first time that sexual violence has happened on campuses but I think now people are tuning in especially with whats happening at FIJI. abolish Greek Life UMN is another recently formed student group that uses their Instagram profile to post stories written by students about their experiences with two Greek life organizations the Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils PERIOD Many of these stories depict sexual assault at fraternity houses and experiences that caused students to drop out of greek life PERIOD

What we hope to do by posting victimsurvivor stories is just to show solidarity the Abolish Greek Life representative said PERIOD Some of the members of the group did experience sexual violence on campus and didnt feel like they had the outlet to talk about their stories and I think thats so true for so many other victimsurvivors. advocacy in the Greater Minneapolis Community

Like Abolish Greek Life UMN other groups in the Minneapolis community are working to elevate the voices of victimsurvivors PERIOD One of these groups is called Break the Silence PERIOD

Anishaa Kamesh a board member of Break the Silence said the organization is a grassroots survivorled organization that works to support survivors and dismantle rape culture through a traumainformed and victimcentered approach. in the past Break the Silence joined conversations surrounding sexual violence on campus PERIOD In  they organized a nonviolent protest in response to sexual assault allegations against  University football players

We have aligned ourselves with survivors in the community in their fights for justice and accountability through nonviolent demonstrations Kamesh said PERIOD

Aside from their directaction work Break the Silence has fought for four years for legislative change to eliminate barriers for victimsurvivors PERIOD They recently helped pass a bill in the Minnesota legislature ending the statue of limitation for sexual assault cases PERIOD This bill went into effect on Wednesday PERIOD

Another group on campus the Aurora Center works to provide free confidential and accessible resources to student and staff victimsurvivors PERIOD Housed in Appleby Hall the Aurora Center advocates for victimsurvivors at the University of Minnesota and Augsburg University in the legal system academic settings through medical examinations law enforcement and in finding safe housing PERIOD

Our mission is to serve all student survivors and concerned people regarding sexual assault relationship violence stalking and sexual harassment at the University of MinnesotaTwin Cities as well as Augsburg University said Katie Eichele director of the Aurora Center PERIOD

The Aurora Center focuses on giving victimsurvivors back the control and choice in processing an experience that took away that control and bodily autonomy said Gavin Grivna the associate director of the Aurora Center

I think its important that victimsurvivors have the ability to choose following what has taken place because a survivor doesnt have a choice with what they experience Grivna said PERIOD Being able to create that choice and autonomy is really important and what we prioritize. the Aurora Center staff members are dedicated to supporting victimsurvivors decisions and providing the right services to address their wants and needs Grivna said PERIOD

At the end of the day we just want the survivor to feel supported Grivna said PERIOD Theres places and people they can go to for support to be heard and engage in what a healing journey looks like for them. while the services and resources at the Aurora Center on campus are available as free confidential support for victimsurvivors the firstever national memorial to honor victims and survivors stands in Boom Island Park PERIOD

This project started by Break the Silence is meant to create a safe space for victimsurvivors in the Minneapolis community to heal and reflect according to Kamesh PERIOD

The recent studentled protest along with advocacy efforts led by groups like Break the Silence and the Aurora Center are just some of the recent advocacy efforts at the University and greater Minneapolis community that provide safety and healing to victimsurivors while striving to end the stigma of speaking out against sexual violence PERIOD

However according to the representative from Abolish Greek Life UMN there is still a long road ahead in the fight to end rape culture and the silencing of victimsurvivors rooted in fraternities  and in society as a whole PERIOD

Its going to be a long battle and I hope it continues said the representative from Abolish Greek Life UMN PERIOD Im hopeful because Im seeing a whole bunch of other people getting involved and I think there needs to be a longterm solution just because it shouldnt fall on the shoulders of the students to do this work. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday

There is a very fine line between selling your body which everyone has the right to do so and being forced or manipulated into doing so PERIOD There is a clear difference between a sugar daddy and the situation which you describe which I am shocked you dont see PERIOD Do you simply see ALL sex work as something that should be banned You tell of very emotional stories which are horrible at repeated across the world with both genders but completely ignore the valid points of a womans or mans right to use their body as their wish and label me as someone who simply does not care about victims PERIOD That is an extreme assumption to label me as crass while you label yourself as the bringer of morality by saying you care about something completely different from what I discussed in my comments PERIOD You simplified and construed my comments to work around the narrative you are creating which is that me discussing a persons right to engage in sex work as a supporter of the sex slave trade. that I would not care if my son or daughter were to be forced or manipulated into becoming a slave PERIOD A slave is someone who does not possess a choice and I am again shocked you would direct my comments in such a light PERIOD There is no discounting the stories of victims but for you to use the story you describe to label me as your target or otherwise a supporter of sex slavery PERIOD The shallowness which you have to take my comments for freedom and say that it again applies to sex slavery or just as horrible rape of any kind PERIOD If that is your opinion you may want to read the text a little closer because you are only finding what you wish in my comments PERIOD Freedom has absolutely nothing to do with sex slavery or rape of any kind and for me to have to further share with an intelligent person as yourself is shocking PERIOD Freedom stops the moment a person is FORCED to do something they do not wish to do PERIOD Why would you take what I have written which was not to do with sex slavery but the right for any person to use their body as they wish and additionally the VERY REAL consequences of banning frats and construct such a false narrative My response never discounted the experience of any victim on the contrary I detailed how the mission to label all Frats are Fiji and shut them down could severely damage and limit any resources or recourse for victims to access on campus PERIOD My response to the extremely strong mothers comments about taking action against posts for sugar daddies etc is something you have twisted PERIOD I cannot discount the experiences of any victim but for you to mitigate my explanation and defense for a human beings right to own or sell their body and say that it is meant as some attack on her or her daughter is grotesque and beyond insulting PERIOD You are taking offense for somebody else and her daughter and then further labeling me as some shallow emotionless attacker PERIOD Then to use another victims story about a horrible situation of forced sex slavery in a way that makes it seem as if I somehow label that as freedom and support it I honestly do not understand PERIOD You seem like a very intelligent individual but in response to your manipulative narrative of my comments I can only shout how dare you at this laptop screen PERIOD It is one thing to misconstrue the intentions of someone but for you to take my comments and create your own to put me in such a light is disgusting PERIOD You are brave enough to share your story and Im sure that act has inspired many others to do the same PERIOD You offered an inspirational and emotional survivor story but instead of sharing that narrative to inspire or caution you used it to target me as someone who would be supportive of such atrocities PERIOD I do hope you read this to completion one day because you are the last individual based on your first post to create such a shallow narrative from comments that never offered any support for sex slavery victimblaming or any other aspects of rape culture PERIOD I posed questions and identified obstacles with the topics of shutting down frats and the right of every human being to do what they wish with their own body PERIOD How is the sex slavery you offer in your response to my comments and any other sex which is done against ones will freedom Where did I ever discount question or otherwise discredit the traumatic experiences of the mother her daughter OR EVEN YOU How can you manipulate my words just to make me some terrible attacker while you hop in with your own completely unrelated narrative to allow you to appear holier than thou. oh because youre some divine individual by dramatically stating I do after falsely accusing me of supporting sex slavery How could you spin such a narrative in which I am the villain but you are conveniently the only one who stands for justice Where did I advise this publication to publish specific content You have targeted me unrightfully so for multiple viewpoints which I do not have and have certainly not expressed in my comments PERIOD The pain you have expressed is real and heard although I acknowledge that there is nothing words can do to aid in the continuous struggle PERIOD I have no issue with the expression of hurt in hopes it will lead to healing and allowing all victims a place they can feel not only safe but comfortable enough to be heard PERIOD What I do have an issue with is the fact you wrap the pain you have in with a false narrative that implies I am somehow for the very horrifying acts I had repeatedly said I was against PERIOD That is not ok PERIOD That is linking me into not only beliefs I dont hold but acts for which I had no control over PERIOD You do not know my experiences nor those of anyone else that hasnt shared their story PERIOD So why in your attempt to target me would you continue after labeling me a supporter of sex slavery with your specific trauma as if I am somehow rooting for you to suffer further I dont know if you meant to just further express your story or if it was an another subject for which you think I am supportive of but it deserves its own comment or reply if the latter is true PERIOD This is disheartening if not grotesque how you chose to frame my words PERIOD Lastly how F dare you act for even a moment as if I or  of planet earth would not care if your daughter or son get involved with life or have institutions which groom young women and men into the sex slave trade especially without EVER considering the circumstances I or any other individual has experienced PERIOD It reflects extreme self righteousness that you would depict anyone let alone someone who posted what I did above about the freedom to CHOOSE as indifferent and vein to the thought of their child being forced into sex slavery PERIOD Cmonreally
Read closer and next time label the right people as emotionless creatures before you try to appear Ill use the phrase again holier than thou with your response PERIOD
The pain carried by any victim is real and deserves support PERIOD Whoever reads this you dont need to be silent somebody cares and so many more people are willing to listen PERIOD
With sincere love handshake hug and best wishes going forward in all of lifes highs and lows..AL

As a man who was sexually assaulted by a woman while I was a pledge at Phi Delta Theta Fraternity before it recently returned after I gave a complaint to the University of Minnesota Student Affairs attorney Nick Barbatsis in  due to drug dealing and poor leadership I see that rape is a difficult thing from which to recover PERIOD  I still have nightmares of it and an Augsburg University football player with whom I spoke in  began to break down in tears recounting how a woman drugged him and how several people held him down and forced penetration PERIOD  He was upset that he could not stop the assault PERIOD  Women are also sexual aggressors and the American Journal of Public Health detailed a study of well over  women and  men There was just a threethousand difference in the amount of men versus women who were raped PERIOD

Here is what the American Journal of Public Health reported in June  in a study entitled The Sexual Victimization of Men in America New Data Challenge Old Assumptions

in  the CDC reported results from the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey NISVS one of the most comprehensive surveys of sexual victimization conducted in the United States to date PERIOD The survey found that men and women had a similar prevalence of nonconsensual sex in the previous  months . million women and . million men. this remarkable finding challenges stereotypical assumptions about the gender of victims of sexual violence PERIOD However unintentionally the CDCs publications and the media coverage that followed instead highlighted female sexual victimization reinforcing public perceptions that sexual victimization is primarily a womens issue. women you do not have a monopoly on being raped PERIOD  The difference between you and men is that the press covers female victims and undermines public policy by not doing due diligence and documenting male victims PERIOD  Apart from pregnancy the psychological damage is the same  Difficulty with trust and intimacy PERIOD  Difficulty with selfesteem and depression PERIOD  Suicidal ideation and execution PERIOD  Productivity problems PERIOD  Financial hardship over the course of years due to feeling out of sorts with the rest of the world PERIOD

A University of Minnesota police officer laughed at me in Fall of  when I called to report my being raped perpetrated by an acquaintance while I was sleeping PERIOD  He said Barry Relax PERIOD  Enjoy all of it you can get PERIOD  Im not going to take a report. i recently spoke to MPD Sex Crimes Unit LT Emily Olson to determine what is currently happening in Minneapolis PERIOD  She said that the Unit doesnt discriminate  Women if you rape a man in Minneapolis get ready for arrest if you are known and are identified PERIOD

The bias against men reporting this crime to political bodies is so insidious that I as a 42year member of the Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor Party DFL as a volunteer and international  lecturer in the 1980s on the DFL and officer for ten years was banned from both Minnesota DFL Senate District  in which the University of Minnesota Minneapolis Campus is located Central Committee meetings and by right of that I was banned from Minnesota DFL Congressional District  Central Committee meetings  despite having thwarted a physical attack on former Minnesota State Representative Ilhan Omar on the night she was attacked by other women several years ago PERIOD  My ban was apparently for life PERIOD  This said over three million women and men marched on Washington DC in  to protest criminal behavior by men and only men PERIOD

The individual who banned me had assumingly hangups about mental health considerations as when Id much earlier identified as one with depression anxiety and PTSD which were all outgrowths of severe abuse both including the rape sexual molestation by two female job interviewers over several interviews in  when I was 20years old and seeking employment for the first time as an adult and other crimes on the Minneapolis campus against me by men who frequently beat stalked and harassed me for two academic years due to learning from a medical student brother of my diagnoses he refused to respond to me PERIOD  He looked through me around me and over me and never said one word to me  until the allegation of sexual harassment due to notifying my colleagues of the need to look into this public health and safety concern PERIOD  My GPA fell to below a . average and I didnt make it to law and public affairs school PERIOD

Men if you are raped by a woman have the courage and persistence to move forward with a criminal complaint PERIOD  Go to the press about this PERIOD  Find an attorney who will speak on your behalf PERIOD  The Minnesota State Bar Association an organization of judges and attorneys can assist you in finding an attorney if you do not use the University of Minnesota students attorneys for care PERIOD  Do not let the notion that women were once considered as the fairer sex interfere with you taking a very objective and determined stand toward putting the women behind bars and being responsible for your medical and legal bills with additional financial punitive judgments against her and into your pocket PERIOD  My rapist was a masters in social work student from Costa Rica who Id met through a former fiance at the Weyerhaeuser Chapel at Macalester College four years earlier PERIOD  My fiance was a Bolivian woman whose dad later became president of that nation PERIOD

At age 59years I have never married and have concerns about the maturity emotional balance and integrity of women as Ive also been stalked by a female medical student who knew intimate details about my family life and residence before ever speaking to me and who was apparently seeking a rich boyfriend PERIOD  She was literally breathless when we began talking hyped about meeting another possible prince charming PERIOD  Her home residence was in Minnetonka MN as I later learned PERIOD  Her behavior was eerie and hellbent on being around wealth for the sake of wealth PERIOD  As one whos enjoyed friendship with poor Native Americans Latinos and Africans as well as guys whose uncles were billionaires and who are millionaires many twentytimes over as well as with members of the middle class on all continents including Antarctica I am interested in people with character and integrity not wealth PERIOD  Wealth will come with time PERIOD  Moreover it is not an end to life if millionaire or billionaire status is not reached  Learning to live with oneself is far more important PERIOD

Please know that I dont hate women PERIOD  I support and encourage women in Africa the U.S. and formerly in Japan China and Mongolia PERIOD  I paid for gynecology surgery out of my pocket for a young woman who I unofficially adopted who had pain from heavy menses and uterine fibroids PERIOD  Ive paid for obstetrics care for another woman in Africa and am taking an interest in assisting yet another woman in Africa develop better reading and writing skills in her midtwenties as she has less than a junior high school education as is true of many women in Africa PERIOD

The difference between women and men who are raped and molested is that parents and other family members take a caring interest PERIOD  My stories have led to me being ostracized by my family though my dad has been a fine conversationalist and political satirist and an attorney who received high praises from University of Minnesota Law School grad Minnesota Attorney General U.S PERIOD Senator Vice President and Ambassador Walter Mondale after whom our law school has been named PERIOD  Mondale and his family were neighbors of my family in the 1970s and 1980s when they were in Minneapolis PERIOD

Of the fraternity nicknamed FIJI I also lived there for a while PERIOD  One of the forms of entertainment which they watched in  were snuff films  films where people were shown being killed with hay forks and axes PERIOD  I was sent away from the house during their ceremonial weekend and returned to find that my room and belongings had been used by crass and ungroomed youth who spit chewing tobacco into my coffee mug and left my room in disarray PERIOD  Phi Delta Theta whose frequent motto was I feltah my dateah was a place where men felt that they were societally inured to have sex get drunk and get high PERIOD  I was blackballed for not taking an interest in their drug and liquor parties PERIOD

I myself was led to believe that sexual encounters at a young age was necessary by older members of my family who got on my case because I was still a virgin at age 19years PERIOD  In one hapless moment I unbuttoned a dates blouse and begin to go for her breasts PERIOD  She cried PERIOD  I didnt date for several years feeling horrible that Id misread and misunderstood the situation due to societal and cultural pressures PERIOD  That period was nearing the end of the Sexual Revolution around the world where free sex and nudist colonies abounded and The Joy of Sex was a manual which some adults of the 70s had around their home PERIOD  It was a time of confusion and exploration PERIOD  Women were as active as men in their determination to show their maturity by getting sexually involved with people they barely knew PERIOD

However well led and well organized fraternities and sororities can serve a social cultural and commercial good as they bring together people who under the right circumstances and leadership  and organizational culture  can lead to longterm relationships and networking opportunities PERIOD  I havent made use of this but I see that under better conditions they can be a force for good PERIOD  The problem is getting mature and interested advisors and role models involved who set up rules for behavior and communication which are healthy and productive  not the beer liquor and sex cultures which Ive seen prevalent in my days as a visitor member and border in a variety of fraternities PERIOD  Delta Delta Delta Fraternity TriDelta in  took in a female border with bipolar disorder and sex addiction PERIOD  She was routinely passed around for sex by the fraternity members PERIOD  I was a border and concerned for her health and safety PERIOD  I contacted her dad who was an administrator at University of Minnesota House Services during that period to share my concern as the woman was a subject of gossip PERIOD

Being in college and developing an understanding of sexuality go hand in hand PERIOD  Problems will crop up PERIOD  It is important for women and men to set boundaries with the people they are around PERIOD  This is a learning process PERIOD  Perfection never comes but wisdom follows PERIOD

Sex slavery is a problem all over the world PERIOD  I knew a woman from Japan who had difficulty in high school ran away from home and got involved with older men PERIOD  she was taken in by the Japanese mafia and frighted with threats of death and violence to her family members were she to leave PERIOD

She finally bought a ticket to the U.S. where a madame  a prostitute slave master found her and got her involved with sex slavery in Missouri PERIOD  She fled back to Japan where the mafia caught up with her again PERIOD

She went to the U.S PERIOD Embassy in Tokyo and appleied for asylum and held as a trafficked person PERIOD  She made it to the U.S PERIOD and was given guidance a job and a place to live PERIOD  I havent seen her for several years but my first impression of her was very heartwarming PERIOD  She had married was a mom iof a newbordn baby girl and told her story while crying PERIOD

You may not care if your daughter or son get involved with life or have institutions which groom young women and men into the sex slave trade PERIOD  I do PERIOD  Some of your questions are interesting and I touched on them in my own comment after your your reply to the parent who spoke of her daughters travails PERIOD  Your comment about freedom to use their body as they desire was in my opinion slovenly and crass PERIOD

Advising the Minnesota Daily to not publish ads from Seekers or other organizations like this is something which I support PERIOD

With regard to the University of Minnesota Student Affairs Office and General Counsels office in the 1980s and 1990s when I was a student the administrators and police officers were deadbeats and moneygrubbers who didnt take an interest in my situation with having been stalked harassed and beaten by two lowlife criminals  for two academic years and who interfered with my studies and future life PERIOD  Id desired to become an attorney diplomat and businessman PERIOD  I am in poverty at the age of  due to being fearful of going into public places after this University and earlier U.S PERIOD school officials refused to lift a hand against violently abusive male and female students PERIOD  I had no problems during studies in Scandinavia and Central America and my grades were at the . gPA PERIOD  American arrogance is a plague and humiliation to human life PERIOD

I am the son of a highly ranked and now retired attorney whose friend included the son of U.S PERIOD Vice President Hubert H PERIOD Humphrey whose name appears on our school of public affairs and who was our Minnesota Attorney General many years ago PERIOD  I havent had a comfortable hug in many years and have difficulty with physical shows of affection given decades of physical and sexual abuse by women and men PERIOD  So much for White privilege PERIOD

Doesnt a female over the age of  have a right to own her body And therefor shouldnt she be allowed to use her body to make money I agree there should be restriction on WHO is allowed to post on university property anyone who isnt apart of the university but to restrict anyones way to make money from their own body is not something the university or anyone else other than the individual should  be able to decide PERIOD

Sexual assault is not a choice for the victim PERIOD Female or even male when it is referenced in some hazing rituals PERIOD The problem with shutting down frats is that they will never shut down PERIOD They may not get sponsorship from the university but that only means that the parties they throw they will always find an easy way to do this and any incidents that occur at them are out of the jurisdiction of the university PERIOD The college cant step in provide punishments or even attempt to plan for the future so frats will have more freedom than they do now PERIOD

Another thing I dont understand is why frats and not sororities are being targeted for protest PERIOD There are hundreds of cases that dont make headlines which involve sever sorority hazing and heavy reinforcement of what society deems rape culture PERIOD I could at least be supportive in theory if this was a movement that would address all concerns of this issue not just what was front page news PERIOD There are countless other frats AND sororities that have conducted horrible sexual assaults and hazing but yet their focus seems centered around just one aspect of the on campus rape culture PERIOD

As a parent whos daughter was victim of sexual assault at a U of MN fraternity to the students behind this movement I commend you  The journey to healing is long and hard especially because the victims face the stigma of speaking out PERIOD   Within this rape culture lies victim blaming where women are told to change their own behavior in order to avoid being assaulted or raped PERIOD  The violence is often downplayed as part of college life PERIOD  Unfortunately our universitys ongoing support of fraternities doesnt present them as unsafe until they are and there is another victim PERIOD

The other issue that needs to be addressed is the campus advertising of sites such as Seeking which promotes sugar daddysugar baby relationships as a means to pay bills PERIOD  Ive read several articles advertising sugar daddy sites in the MN Daily PERIOD  These sites are dangerous and they prey on young vulnerable college girls PERIOD  The allowable advertising on campus gives girls a false sense of safety until it isnt PERIOD  Its an open door to human traffickingwatch the news

Please U of MN administration step up and work together with these students to keep our university safe for everyone  I tried to get your attention when our daughter was a student there but you didnt listen PERIOD  Our familys lives are forever changed as a result of the rape culture of the U of MN fraternities Dont look away and keep letting it happen PERIOD",UMN student-led movement against rape culture gains traction – The Minnesota Daily,University of Minnesota Twin Cities
