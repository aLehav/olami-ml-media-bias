Im looking for a word PERIOD Six letters PERIOD

It isnt on the tip of my tongue or in the blank boxes of a crossword puzzle PERIOD

The word I think might be south of campus so I walk to  S PERIOD Cooper St PERIOD as sunset nears PERIOD

The word was left in October  and on this spring day in  I dont think Ill find it PERIOD

So I cross the bridge over Mitchell Street cross the expansive black parking lot and the thin Doug Russell Road PERIOD At the address theres a caf PERIOD

Beirut PERIOD Six letters PERIOD

I was right PERIOD I didnt find it PERIOD

Im hoping to find something left over from  but nothing seems familiar PERIOD I dont even think this is that same building Im looking for PERIOD

I walk around Beirut Rock Caflooking for something recognizable PERIOD It isnt every day you have the chance to feel history but I feel nothing PERIOD Instead I snap a photographturn away and walk PERIOD



I was looking for a word someone left in  PERIOD Six letters PERIOD

Nigger PERIOD

At this point I should say you should get comfortable with this word if you intend to continue reading PERIOD

I found it in Oct PERIOD   running at the top of that days issue of The Shorthorn here in our archives PERIOD



Herschels the head nigger  the provocative headline reads in dominating letters PERIOD

In the summer of  the restaurant owned by Herschel Matthews and located at  S PERIOD Cooper St PERIOD changed its name from Podnuhs Barbeque to The Big Niggers Bar B Que PERIOD

A photograph of the original sign can be found here from a  issue ofTexas Monthly that can be found here PERIOD

The face of Herschel Matthews head nigger may surprise you PERIOD



Herschel Matthews owner and operator of Big Niggers Bar B Que on Cooper Street is seen in this photograph from  PERIOD The Shorthorn Jim Mercer

As far as the name nigger is concerned it is not a derogatory name to me Matthews said in the article published in  PERIOD Anyone who thinks of it in those terms needs to search himself PERIOD Its very positive as far as Im concerned. that article profiled the restaurant owner and his shop PERIOD As can be expected a negative response to the story followed PERIOD

At least a dozen black students have protested the lead story in last Fridays Shorthorn a message from Shorthorn staff reads in the following issue PERIOD We sincerely regret any hard feelings or misunderstanding that may have resulted but we do not apologize for the story. the message in that Wednesday newspaper said those students have been offered a forum to present their views in Fridays paper. in Fridays section for letters to the editor only two such responses appear both negative PERIOD

You publicized in the paper Oct PERIOD  that you offered a forum to the black students to voice our views student Royce West writes PERIOD This wasnt officially offered to us if memory serves correctly. west questions in his letter why the dominant story that day was about a restaurant and not the presentation of  to the Minority Culture Center PERIOD

Another student John Ogletree listed reasons he believed the intent of the article was nefarious. 5the article it seemed was attempting to get Blacks to accept being called or to think of themselves as niggers  Ogletree wrote PERIOD If thats your way of promoting interracial respect and understanding all I can say is SURELY YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT

At the risk of shooting myself in the foot I encourage you to read the story which is reprinted below PERIOD Its a read I didnt think I would enjoy when I first flipped the page saw that word and stared in disbelief PERIOD

Its the last few lines I find particularly interesting delving into the mind of Matthews a man you might now hate based on what youve read already PERIOD He starts with his youth in the Jim Crow South PERIOD

I wound up finding out that I was a nigger PERIOD I said this is one thing Im gonna have to live with so I must find a lot of comfort in doing so Matthews said PERIOD After many years of life  years to be exact I have seen many changes PERIOD As far as the socalled nigger is concerned hes been beautiful to me. i found a 6letter word standing over Arlington in October  PERIOD I found it on a yellowed paper from that October  PERIOD Though the word has been there more than  years youll find we still argue about what it is PERIOD

Yes Virginia there is a Big Nigger. walk into The Big Niggers Bar B Que on Cooper Street and ask for the big nigger and a 60yearold black man will tell you proudly I am the head nigger in charge and dont you forget it

But Herschel Matthews is not the burly type that the restaurants name implies PERIOD

For Matthews the restaurants new name proudly displayed on a 20foot sign is the fulfillment of a twoyear dream PERIOD His wife and friends tried to discourage him but he felt it was something he had to do PERIOD

As far as the name nigger is concerned it is not a derogatory name to me he said PERIOD Anyone who thinks of it in those terms needs to search himself PERIOD

Its very positive as far as Im concerned. matthews said if the word nigger means an individual who is shiftless he steals hes dishonest or what have you then there are just as many white niggers as black ones. matthews changed his restaurant from Podnuhs to The Big Niggers Bar B Que early last summer PERIOD He insists the name change is not a gimmick but a reality. i think it was just more or less searching for my identity Matthews said PERIOD I think every individual has his own destiny if he can find it PERIOD I think I was fortunate enough to recognize mine when I did find it. matthews who works  to  hours per day seven days a week has been cooking barbecue since he was  years old PERIOD He has had several businesses throughout the years PERIOD

Nigger barbecue is better the wiry cook insists PERIOD The reason is that black people invented it PERIOD

It comes more or less from survival he explained PERIOD Before the turn of the century when people began to have modern equipment the average Negro or nigger so to speak was forced to outside cooking PERIOD

Thats what barbecue is outside cooking PERIOD

In the hot summertime they didnt want to heat up the house so they went outdoors and dug a hole in the yard with a piece of iron pipe or something across it to hold the utensils or whatever theyre cooking. matthews has had some trouble recently with militant groups PERIOD When the groups visited him he said they discussed the restaurants name and why he uses it PERIOD

He believes the name change has relieved some persons of subconscious tension surrounding the word PERIOD This might be the beginning of something he said PERIOD I keep trying to tell myself that it must be. as a result of the name change business has improved Matthews said PERIOD He added that more blacks are coming also PERIOD He is pleased with response from the community and his customers PERIOD

All the people have been lovely he said with a smile PERIOD Theyve been very decent very concerned PERIOD Many of them think as I think PERIOD A lot of the ones who dont have changed their thoughts. matthews said he doesnt cater to white or black customers PERIOD Any man he said will get his respect but he insists that it be returned PERIOD

Any white man I respect I automatically demand respect from him PERIOD Any white man that crosses me he just as well caught hold to a bad junkyard dog PERIOD Ill hurt him so help me if he tries to abuse me PERIOD

Continued on page 



Continued from page 

When I was in my youthful figure Id have tried to kill him with my bare hands but today I dont stoop to such ignorance PERIOD

If a white man is ignorant and he wont open his mouth to show how ignorant he is I let him go PERIOD I try to show him Im intelligent and try to act accordingly PERIOD If he wants to act a damn fool thats his business just dont touch me. racial problems Matthews said come from a lack of communication and understanding and a hesitancy to express sincere feelings. if people would let their guard down barriers would disappear he said PERIOD

The gap between Negroes and the whites is not as wide as it seems even now PERIOD Its always been narrow PERIOD Theres always been a closeness between them PERIOD

Hell  years ago they all were poor PERIOD Nigger and white were poor PERIOD They swapped out PERIOD Which ever had the most they shared it with the others and we were much more together then than we are now. religion plays a large role in Matthews life and he believes it has united many blacks PERIOD He takes his Bible teachings seriously and literally PERIOD

Only thing thats superior to me is the God thats in heaven he said PERIOD That is the only man supreme to me PERIOD He is the greatest PERIOD

When you come face to face with reality you have nothing to turn to but your gods of some type or another PERIOD The Negro throughout the years has turned to his real God and has found salvation. matthews was born in Oklahoma but his parents moved to Greenville Tex. while he was young PERIOD He attended Langston University in Guthrie Okla. and the University of Oklahoma and grew up with the Jim Crow Laws of the south PERIOD

Prejudice he said is more common in the North than the South PERIOD

Theyll throw a rock and hide their hands in the North so to speak PERIOD In the South you knew where you were PERIOD You didnt allow yourself the experience of thinking you were actually free when you werent. matthews said he found his identity early as a young man PERIOD

I wound up finding out that I was a nigger PERIOD I said this is one thing Im gonna have to live with so I must find a lot of comfort in doing so PERIOD

After many years of life  years to be exact I have seen many changes PERIOD As far as the socalled nigger is concerned hes been beautiful to me. do you have your own opinion on the word its use or the words of Herschel Matthews What do you think of The Shorthorns coverage of this story both then and nowComment and let us know PERIOD

Restaurant owner Herschel Matthews sits in this photograph published on Oct PERIOD   PERIOD The Shorthorn Jim Mercer

Brb getting chair and popcorn before the shtshow begins

At some point it must be recognized by all selfrespecting African Americans that the same concern shown towards nonblacks use of the nword needs to also be shown towards disrespectful African Americans who publicly embrace and use the nword as a socalled term of endearment PERIOD It is every bit as disrespectful in fact MORE SO to take a word that dehumanized and objectified their ancestors and be low down enough to make a mockery of their sacrifices and struggles and shamelessly putting this word to music etc PERIOD is an abomination PERIOD To sit back watch and allow this insanity to happen refusing to speak out against it is negligence beyond comprehension PERIOD
