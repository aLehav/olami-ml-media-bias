More than  OSU students wont be able to enroll for the spring semester if they dont comply with Oklahomas immunization law PERIOD



All students new to the university system must send immunization records to University Health Services before Oct PERIOD  to avoid enrollment delays PERIOD The records should prove students have had two measles mumps and rubella vaccinations and a threeshot hepatitis B series PERIOD



Students not in compliance with the law are being sent emails PERIOD They need to submit records to UHS or file a waiver to have their enrollment hold removed PERIOD



Students who attended Oklahoma high schools should not have any difficulties complying with this requirement PERIOD



 said Stephen Rogers director of University Health Services PERIOD Students from Texas will have had the two MMR shots but not the hepatitis shotFor most students this is purely a bureaucratic issue PERIOD They dont need additional immunizations only their records.About  students are not in compliance with these requirementsWe started with over  students being out of compliance.We dont want there to be a problem for students when enrollment starts PERIOD We want the students to work with us to get compliantWe dont want their enrollment delayed because of this paperwork.We started emailing students this weekWe will send out a second email notice on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD We will mail a paper notice to their billing address before Oct PERIOD  if they still havent sent us the information PERIOD



We can suggest locations where their immunization records may be found and what their exemption options areThose that need immunizations we can provide those for them.The state didnt give us additional funds to cover the cost of the policyI estimate it cost UHS about  per year to oversee compliance of this law PERIOD We didnt raise student fees either PERIOD We just absorbed it the cost.The Oklahoma Department of Health recommends that students from Oklahoma not be excluded from these policiesHowever each board of regents created its own set of rules as long as they followed the statute PERIOD OU decided to exempt its students from the policy against the recommendation of the Oklahoma Department of Health.Youve got to do somethingDont ignore it if you get an email PERIOD Dont ignore it if you get a letter PERIOD Just dont ignore it. more information and waiver forms are available at httpwww.okstate.eduUHS or by calling   PERIOD
