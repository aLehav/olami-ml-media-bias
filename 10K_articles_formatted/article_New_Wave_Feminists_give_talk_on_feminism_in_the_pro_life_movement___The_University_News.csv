3646,2018-10-10,"prolife and feminist lately these two words seem inherently opposed to each other PERIOD

On Monday night in the Center for Global Citizenship New Wave Feminists Destiny Delarosa and Kristen Walker Hatten came to SLU to argue against that very idea PERIOD The two women identify as both feminists and as prolife activists PERIOD

Hatten and Delarosa were invited by SLU Students for Life President Betsy Daly who emphasized her desire to bring intersectional speakers to campus in the hopes that their multifaceted views might apply to a wider audience than Students for Life alone PERIOD Daly mentioned her desire to focus on more than just abortion

We try to make our protection of life allaround Daly said PERIOD We take a stance against all attacks on life  especially on abortion the death penalty physicianassisted suicide or euthanasia poverty and violence PERIOD If we say were prolife then we have to be for the whole human person throughout the entire life span PERIOD We try to be a very compassionate base rather than just shouting This is right

Hatten and Delarosas presentation focused largely on what they see as key issues within both the current feminist movement and the current prolife movement PERIOD Much of what they said addressed the necessity of the prolife movement to become a womens movement as well PERIOD

Were trying to rebrand the movement Delarosa said PERIOD It has to become a movement that is womancentered PERIOD It has to become about empowering women PERIOD Thats how were going to stop abortion PERIOD The prochoice side is all about saying You cant do this PERIOD Youre not strong enough and the prolife side needs to become more about You can do this you are absolutely strong enough and we will be there to help you help yourself PERIOD Wewant to spread this message of courage of being a hero PERIOD Maybe you didnt plan this pregnancy but you have a chance to save a life now. i want the same rebranding for feminism that the prolife movement needs said Hatten PERIOD It seems like feminism has become synonymous with womens healthcare which has become synonymous with abortion PERIOD And its so much bigger than that. the two shared their personal testimonies about what led them to become prolife activists PERIOD

Delarosa was the child of an accidental pregnancy and is the mother of a son born under those circumstances as well PERIOD Hatten spoke of her extremely prochoice leaning views in the past and how a close friend of hers changed her own views on the matter and altered Hattens own thoughts on abortion through thoughtful discussion of ethics and medical science rather than by religious attack PERIOD

Daly agreed and spoke of her desire to see a change in the way people view the relationship of the fetus to the body of the mother PERIOD

I think that there has to be a realization that the child is in the mother the child is not part of the mother Daly argued PERIOD

The child is just as important as the woman PERIOD But just as important as the woman means that the woman is important PERIOD Both are very very important PERIOD An abortion places the woman above the child but only caring about banning abortion makes only the child important PERIOD I think the prolife movement needs to improve in that regard being probaby prowoman prolife. delarosa and Hatten said that they have faced minimal opposition for their stance PERIOD They have never had a protestor at one of their events PERIOD According to Hatten mostpeople have been happy to hear a fresh perspective that takes social justice and feminism into account PERIOD

Not all students were convinced however PERIOD On a personal point because of religion I am prolife but I do not believe there are sustainable arguments for policy said attendee Daniela Feliciano PERIOD

I truly believe in women having the option in women having the agency to do whatever they think is best with and for their bodies PERIOD I believe my role is to create prevention resources so that abortion is not necessary in the first place. feliciano also said that she felt the presentation was not intersectional and came across as onedimensional PERIOD The speaker had a slutshaming approach to prolife which I do not agree with Feliciano said PERIOD

During the presentation Hatten and Delarosa challenged the idea that powerful female icons such as Beyonc do more harm than good by emphasizing their sexuality as part of what makes them valuable PERIOD

Hatten and Delarosa plan on attending the March for Life this January and said they would be live on social media for anyone interested in following them PERIOD

Thats how were going to stop abortion PERIOD The prochoice side is all about saying You cant do this PERIOD Youre not strong enough

 PERIOD Its embarrassing to hear these women claim they can stop abortion PERIOD Women have been seeking out and giving themselves abortions since the beginning of time PERIOD Theres no such thing as abolishing the practice of abortion newsflash PERIOD What you CAN do is help PREVENT it by emphasizing the need to abolish abstinenceonly education which leads to high rates of STDs and teen pregnancies by putting pressure on policymakers to ensure easier access to all forms of birth control and by championing a national paid family leave law that doesnt force certain women to choose between motherhood and career PERIOD The pro life movement would be far better off putting money resources and political power into the lives of the LIVING children including the near half a million kids in foster care as well as the children living in poverty the US has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the world PERIOD These two women claim they are doing it but this article didnt go into enough depth to show how they are doing or the impact of their supposed activism PERIOD
 PERIOD To claim pro choice feminists have a you cant do this attitude is heinously offensive PERIOD It shows just how nonfeminist these women are and it is also clear this pair are simply coopting the feminist label to present themselves in a more digestible way PERIOD Not buying it ladies PERIOD You dont get to tout yourself as a feminist by dissing other women including Beyonce as stated in the article PERIOD Thats called slutshaming These women would be better off just falling in line with the rest of the inconsistent hypocritical pro life activists who like to blame feminism for certain things not realizing that their freedom to vote be paid equally own property own a bank account and be an activist is thanks to the womens rightsfeminist movements PERIOD

Great article Kristina

Thanks for coving our talk PERIOD I did want to mention that my issue with Beyonc has nothing to with her sexuality PERIOD Im all for women having agency PERIOD The issue is with the commodification of our sexuality and in Beys case also the word Feminism to sell albums PERIOD Commercializing sexuality is what I have a problem with not sexuality itself PERIOD

Just wanted to clarify PERIOD Again thanks for writing a very fair piece PERIOD",New Wave Feminists give talk on feminism in the pro-life movement â€“ The University News,St. Louis University
