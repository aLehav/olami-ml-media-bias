Urging a major shift in U.S PERIOD policy some health experts are recommending that virtually all Americans be tested routinely for the AIDS virus much as they are for cancer and other diseases PERIOD

Since the early years of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s the government has recommended screening only in big cities where AIDS rates are high and among members of highrisk groups such as gay men and drug addicts PERIOD

Two large federally funded studies found that the cost of routinely testing and treating nearly all adults would be outweighed by a reduction in new infections and the opportunity to start patients on drug cocktails early when they work best PERIOD

Given the availability of effective therapy and preventive measures it is possible to improve care and perhaps influence the course of the epidemic through widespread effective and costeffective screening Dr PERIOD Samuel A PERIOD Bozzette wrote in an editorial accompanying the studies which appear in Thursdays New England Journal of Medicine PERIOD

A failure to institute such screening at doctors offices and clinics would be a critical disservice to patients with the AIDS virus and the future health of the nation wrote Bozzette who is from the University of California at San Diego and the Rand Corp PERIOD think tank in Santa Monica Calif PERIOD
