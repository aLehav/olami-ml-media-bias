5959,2023-07-11,"towards the end of the semester students are often flooded with emails from professors encouraging them to complete a Course Instructor Survey CIS to provide feedback on their course experience PERIOD For students it is one of their only chances to offer direct comment on a professors teaching style workload or class content PERIOD

However despite their importance many students  myself included  have often opted out of completing them no matter how nicely theyre asked by professors PERIOD

Unless enough students routinely complete the CIS survey results are not as meaningful as they could potentially be PERIOD Without a representative sample of students survey results are more likely to reflect students outlier experiences  both positive and negative PERIOD

UT should implement a universitywide incentive program to encourage a higher response rate to Course Instructor Surveys PERIOD

While my personal participation in the course survey process has been inconsistent I always consult past CIS results when registering for classes PERIOD In fact at freshman orientation I was advised by student advisors to look at professors average ratings when making course selections PERIOD

And Im not the only student who uses this tool PERIOD

The CIS survey is useful for students because we go and see how the professor is rated said Praveena Javvadi government and Plan II senior PERIOD

It really is in students best interest for everyone to fill out these surveys PERIOD

However despite this benefit many students still do not participate in these surveys due to the fact that theyre offered online PERIOD

When a professor says hey this is the CIS survey Im going to step out for  minutes even if it is on their laptops  taking the class time out to do it gets people to do it more Javvadi said PERIOD Because you are here for class you are already taking the time PERIOD When it is online I dont think it is illintentioned that students dont do it I think it is just less likely to be done. uT cannot expect the same student turnout when students are not given a physical designated time to complete their surveys PERIOD There has to be an additional incentive for students to want to participate PERIOD

The two best practice strategies that UT can leverage include giving students the opportunity to participate in a prize draw for completing course surveys and providing students who submit their CIS with early access to their final course grade PERIOD

Campuswide incentives for related activities are not new to UT they are just not a matter of academic policy PERIOD Departments across campus such as University Housing and Dining have been known to offer students Amazon or Starbucks gift cards UT merchandise or free food for participating in surveys PERIOD

Many professors support an incentive system like this PERIOD

I think that students should be compelled to fill out CIS for every class to get their grades recorded by the registrar said Janice Fischer director of the Biology Instructional Office and professor of molecular biosciences PERIOD

Instructors arent the only ones who see these survey results as survey feedback is reviewed by administration PERIOD In fact according to the CIS website this information  is used in promotion and tenure decisions. the CIS office was not available for comment before the publication of this column PERIOD

It is clear that course evaluation data is important to students instructors and administration PERIOD An incentive system would be a feasible and effective way to encourage students to fill out CIS surveys PERIOD

The CIS office has the opportunity to codify and enhance its efforts to increase CIS participation PERIOD It should take advantage PERIOD
