The mens club basketball team listens to instructions during a practice in Carmichael Gym on Wednesday Sept PERIOD   PERIOD

The NC State mens club basketball team returned home this week after an impressive display last weekend in a tournament at Georgia Tech PERIOD Both teams that the club submitted made it deep into tournament play on Sunday after strong showings on Saturday PERIOD

Both Team Wolf and Team Pack fell to Georgia Tech who hosted the tournament PERIOD Five teams played in the tournament Georgia Tech Team Wolf Team Pack Georgia Gwinnett and Dalton State PERIOD

On Saturday the team played all three nonNC State teams and only lost to Georgia Tech in placement games PERIOD Because of impressive play on Saturday both teams earned a firstround bye on Sunday in bracket play PERIOD

Team Wolf made it to the semifinals in the tournament while Team Pack made it to the finals PERIOD Although both teams lost in their respective finishes the team as a whole was able to grow and develop as they move forward PERIOD

These games are a growing point they didnt really mean anything cocaptain senior Alex Capps said PERIOD This semester is all about practice and next semester is all the regional and national tournaments where it really counts PERIOD On Team Wolf we had a lot of young guys we had five guys who had never played club basketball before PERIOD I was pretty proud of those guys and the way that they played PERIOD They did not back down. the team was without junior point guard Justin McCluney and fifthyear power forwardcenter Max Myers for the tournament putting some of the aforementioned younger players into the spotlight PERIOD

On Team Wolf sophomore shooting guard Jonathan Runymbo and senior shooting guard Riley Edwards shot the ball really well Capps said PERIOD On Team Pack junior small forward Dane Palazzo stood out junior point guard Cam Wimbish played really well PERIOD We were missing a couple of our key guys Justin McCluney Myers could not make it who is probably Team Wolfs best player PERIOD A lot of our stand out guys werent there but we had some new guys show out. palazzo in particular had himself a strong weekend against Georgia Tech accounting for over  points in each game and getting the offense flowing for Team Wolf PERIOD Palazzo also electrified his team when he had a massive putback dunk over Dalton State in the semifinals PERIOD

It was a pretty hype moment Palazzo said PERIOD My main strength as a slasherwing is my athletic abilities. while this was the Packs first tournament of the season it was not the teams first time playing together PERIOD The team played in two games in Wilmington against UNCWs two teams on October  PERIOD Team Wolf and Team Pack both went  in the games winning against the same team and losing against the same team PERIOD

We grew a lot from Wilmington to Georgia Tech Capps said PERIOD We played a lot better at Georgia Tech than we did at UNCW so overall it was a good experience. having grown as a team the club feels good about its chances moving forward despite playing with a new identity and not having as many players as normal due to the games in the fall semester not counting towards tournament play in the spring semester PERIOD

We are really just learning from it Capps said PERIOD I feel confident about our chances I think next semester when the games start to matter more we will have more allaround commitment and focus PERIOD We are going to fix our weaknesses and come back and play better. looking forward to some of the competition Capps feels like the team can stack up against any team it plays PERIOD That includes NIRSA powerhouse UNCPembroke who has troubled the Pack in the past PERIOD

I feel like Team Pack could have won it all Capps said PERIOD As for opponents UNCPembroke is notably pretty good PERIOD Every year they have been pretty good PERIOD I did not play them last year but I played them the year before PERIOD They are probably the best club basketball team I have ever played. next up for the team is a 16team tournament at Chapel Hill on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD The club then has a home tournament its first of the year in Carmichael Gymnasium on November  PERIOD Admission is free to students PERIOD
