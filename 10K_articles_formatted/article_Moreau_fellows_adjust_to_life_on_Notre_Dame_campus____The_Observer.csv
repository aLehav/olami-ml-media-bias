Amanda Gray  Thursday October  

Sekou Remy said he feels like a freshman again on campus even though he has a Ph.D PERIOD

Remy one of the  inaugural fellows of the Moreau Academic Diversity Postdoctoral Fellowship Program said he is still learning his way around campus since his and the other fellows arrival on Aug PERIOD  PERIOD

I like what Ive seen he said PERIOD There are really cool things around PERIOD Its a really nice campus and nice people. remy is from Trinidad and Tobago and works in the field of robotics PERIOD On campus he is working with the computer science and engineering department and also collaborates with faculty in the aerospace and mechanical engineering department PERIOD

Im not teaching this semester but next semester Ill be teaching a class called Assisted Robotics he said PERIOD I hope it will be a fun class PERIOD All the other professors said it sounds fun and that they want to take it. susan Ohmer assistant provost and codirector of the program said she is thrilled with the fellows selected for the first year of the program especially as the committee is now preparing for the second years candidates PERIOD

When I think about them I am bursting with pride she said PERIOD They are fantastic in their fields and Im really proud of them. the deadline for applicants for next years slots is Nov PERIOD  and Ohmer said she noticed a few changes from last year PERIOD

There are around  applications in so far compared to the  applications they had last year she said PERIOD However she said she is not worried because the number could double in a weeks time PERIOD

She said there is also a possibility of selecting fewer than  applicants PERIOD

The word is out there she said PERIOD Theres quite a buzz about it and its popular PERIOD We have a number of international applicants. ohmer said they wont be making any major changes to the program because it has been successful as is PERIOD

The program was designed to help celebrate diversity in all venues of life not just diversity of racial background or culture PERIOD In fields of study seven of the fellows work in the College of Arts and Letters while four work in science and engineering PERIOD With funding help from the Presidents Office several deans and the Lilly Foundation the program was a success she said PERIOD

We work with the idea of diversity Ohmer said PERIOD The way these fellows exemplify diversity is either from underrepresented groups or their research focuses on diversity PERIOD We have some women from fields with few women in them. remy said he can apply diversity to his field of study  though not many attempt to do so PERIOD

One of the things about engineering is that there are not many ways the traditional societal views of diversity fit in like skin color and culture difference he said PERIOD It works in different ways PERIOD It can manifest itself with how familiar you are with different ways to solve a problem. i also embody diversity by having attended both Catholic and secular schools attended engineering and nonengineering schools. in my work I can see similar problems across various disciplines. anne GarciaRomero another Moreau fellow and working in the Film Television and Theatre Department said her ideas on diversity stem from her cultural background PERIOD

Born from a Spanish father and an American mother GarciaRomero works as a playwright and a theatre professor PERIOD

I write about diversity in my plays she said PERIOD In my playwriting I address how Latin and American cultures collide. part of GarciaRomeros fellowship is to write a new play PERIOD She said she is focusing on Martin Ramirez an artist and her play will be structured around his life and work PERIOD

She is also working on a book about Latina playwrights PERIOD

The DeBartolo Performing Arts Center is a phenomenal facility she said PERIOD The whole thing is incredibly impressive PERIOD

The facility just blows everyone else out of the water. the fellowship has offered her a chance to practice her craft and teach she said PERIOD The fellows are required to teach one course a semester while working in their fields of study PERIOD

As a scholarartist I was keenly interested in working in an institution which championed research excellence intellectual rigor and artistic achievement and Notre Dame clearly offered all of this and more GarciaRomero said PERIOD As a bicultural Latina I was encouraged by Notre Dames commitment to cultural diversity PERIOD As a Catholic I was also really interested in the opportunity to engage in a dialogue about issues connected to education in the Catholic tradition. remys only complaint is he is hoping to discover more unique and interesting campus events PERIOD

I get the sense there is so much more to experience he said PERIOD Like the midnight drum circle  thats not in the orientation PERIOD I look forward to experiencing things like that. share This Story

As some  freshmen swarm campus for Freshman Orientation another group of students will.. PERIOD
