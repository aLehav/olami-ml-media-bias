Evolution is a prevalent topic in Sydney Paiges classes PERIOD But that doesnt mean she believes in it PERIOD

The junior agricultural education major a creationist does not oppose learning about evolution in her classes even though she disagrees with it PERIOD

 Paige said PERIOD 

The conflict between the theory of evolution and creationism can be difficult for some people to overcome especially science majors PERIOD For others it is simply nonexistent PERIOD For many opinions depend on how a person defines evolution and creationism PERIOD Evolution can be seen as the adaptation of organisms over time or it can also encompass the idea that all organisms evolved from a single cell PERIOD

Paige said she feels the scientific process does not allow much room for her belief system causing her to feel a sense of alienation PERIOD
