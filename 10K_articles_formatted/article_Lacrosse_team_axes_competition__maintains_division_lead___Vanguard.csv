8731,2019-02-27,"portland State Womens Lacrosse remains undefeated  in their division after a doubleheader played on Feb PERIOD  and  at Peter W PERIOD Stott Community Field PERIOD

Hosting hometown rivals the University of Portland Pilots the Vikings didnt let a little hail stop their determination for victory PERIOD During the first half the Vikings controlled the field scoring seven goals to the Pilots zero PERIOD While UP did get a few points in the second half the Vikingsled by captain Krista Busbynearly doubled their lead sinking the Pilots for the second straight time this season PERIOD

Midfielder Lexi Cattons speed and determination on the field as well as her skillful draw control also contributed to the teams triumph PERIOD

The team played strong defense and controlled the ball a disproportionate amount of the time Catton said PERIOD This allowed us to control the game and keep our players fresh as well as dominating the scoring. the Central Washington University Wildcats pounced at the chance to scrim with the Vikings but were put down in a fiery showdown that saw yellow cards issued to both teams PERIOD The Wildcats scored a total of seven points to the Vikings  with top scores from Busby midfielder Ellen Carpenter and attacker Maddy Blair PERIOD

Carpenter an earlier scorer in both matches attributes the teams success to a strong defense PERIOD

If the other team can never get the ball they cant scoreand we know that she said PERIOD Our defense worked so well together today and our goalies had some awesome saves. despite the cold gray Portland weather the Vikings came with a great deal of energy and a will to win PERIOD

All of us have forged a really strong bond with each other which I think is what sets us apart from other teams Busby said PERIOD Lacrosse is a team sport above all else PERIOD Its impossible to win if everyone is playing as individuals. vikings head coach Megan McGinnis agrees and has developed a holistic method of coaching PERIOD

Think of ecosystem biodiversity McGinnis said PERIOD The most resilient ecosystems are those that are rich in biodiversity PERIOD Holistic training is diverse and we are able to bring in a deeper sense of diversity which leads to a resilient team. i hope to be able to help these players look at this game differently she said PERIOD I want them to see how a yoga class or a dance class can help them grow as players and as a team PERIOD My approach has to do with selfcare PERIOD Im hoping this style not just makes them stronger players and a stronger team but makes them stronger students as well. mcGinnis coaching strong leadership from the team captains and the teams raw skill and determination all but assures Portland States return to the division championship PERIOD

The Vikings are scheduled to play Seattle and Pacific Lutheran during another doubleheader scheduled for March  and  PERIOD
