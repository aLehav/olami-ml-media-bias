The vegetarian plate with red lentils potato curry kale and a  teff injera PERIOD This is one of two options the other coming with two sides beef tibs and an injera for  PERIOD

When I was growing up I never quite realized how lucky I was that my dad made a homecooked meal every night when he got home from work PERIOD Now that Im away in college and subsisting off of cereal boba and way too much pizza I appreciate his cooking more than ever PERIOD

Ive realized that cooking for my family was my dads way of telling us he loved us PERIOD Every bowl of minestrone soup every plate of pasta and every piece of barbeque was his way of showing us how important we are to him PERIOD

Meeraf Mamo chef and coowner of Genis Ethiopian Corner feels the same way about her cooking PERIOD

Thats how I communicate love to my family Mamo said PERIOD Thats why it became special to me. mamo immigrated to the United States from Ethiopia  years ago to get her masters degree in business administration PERIOD After meeting her husband and having kids Mamo became a stayathome mom living in Iowa PERIOD

Three years ago Mamo and her family moved to Seattle for her husbands work PERIOD Mamo still remembers the sharp contrast between smalltown Iowa and her new home in Seattle PERIOD

The first day we came we walked into a food festival and were from a small town in Iowa where we didnt even have a Starbucks and we were like wow this is amazing Mamo said PERIOD

One and a half years later her husband was laid off PERIOD Mamo had been taking culinary classes at a school in Ballard and together they began to talk about starting a food cart PERIOD

Mamo recalled her husband suggesting that they serve the Cuban sandwiches that she had learned how to make in one of her classes PERIOD

Im an Ethiopian how am I gonna sell a Cuban sandwich Mamo remembered thinking PERIOD That doesnt even make sense. instead Mamo decided she wanted to introduce Ethiopian food to Seattle so after renting a commissary kitchen in Queen Anne and experimenting with different dishes Genis Ethiopian Corner opened at the Lake City Farmers Market PERIOD By the end of that year Genis was selling at five markets across Seattle PERIOD

Today Mamo estimates that they serve up to  portions a week both to people at farmers markets and during the week to employees on their lunch breaks PERIOD

Last Saturday on my weekly pilgrimage to the UDistrict Farmers Market I stopped by Genis Ethiopian Corner where I was met with warm service and incredible food PERIOD

At the risk of starting to sound like a broken record I have found another favorite place to eat at the UDistrict Farmers Market PERIOD

I ordered the vegetarian plate which comes with mesir wat spicy red lentils dinich wat potato curry and gomen wat sauteed kale all on top of fermented Ethiopian flatbread PERIOD

As a vegetarian I am a huge fan of lentils and the mesir wat from Genis was incredible PERIOD Creamy and flavorful with just the right amount of kick from a cilantro chili sauce these lentils will appeal to even the most stubborn legumehater PERIOD The potato curry was also excellent warm and filling with the perfect amount of spice PERIOD The sauteed kale added crunch and brightness to the plate PERIOD

And of course theres the Ethiopian flatbread injera PERIOD Fermented flatbread might sound strange but picture a sourdough crepe and youll be close PERIOD Spongy and pleasantly tart the bread is perfect for scooping up every last morsel of food from your plate PERIOD

To top it all off Genis whole menu is gluten free and you can choose a vegetarian plate or the full plate if youre a carnivore PERIOD

About her decision to serve Ethiopian food Mamo reflected on how food can introduce people to other cultures PERIOD

Its almost like breaking down a barrier Mamo said PERIOD

And I have to agree if theres one thing that unites us all as humans it has to be food PERIOD
