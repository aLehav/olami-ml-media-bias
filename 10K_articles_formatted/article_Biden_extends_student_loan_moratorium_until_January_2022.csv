On Aug PERIOD  President Joe Biden announced his administration would be extending the student loan moratorium from the original end date in September  allowing borrowers to pause repayment until Jan PERIOD   PERIOD

The loan moratorium initially began on March   and is a period of suspended federal loan payments frozen interest rates for loans accruing interest and a pause on defaulted loan collection for borrowers across the country PERIOD

The relief measures are selective and determined by the ownership of the loan meaning only a subset of loans are eligible for this suspension PERIOD While defaulted and nondefaulted loans owned by the U.S Department of Education defaulted HEAL loans and nondefaulted Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans all qualify for relief commerciallyowned lender loans schoolowned loans and private loans do not PERIOD

When asked about the targeted eligibility of student loan relief CSG President Nithya Arun a Public Health senior questioned the selectivity PERIOD

This is a demonstrated need Arun said PERIOD I think its the governments duty to cover that especially because at the end of the day youd be investing in our economy in the long run PERIOD And I really dont think theres a need to be selective because we can cover the cost of it PERIOD Its just that we choose not to. in an email to The Michigan Daily LSA junior and founder of UMs Students for Biden Andrew Schaeffler said he believes Bidens plan is a great start in giving aid to those who need it most especially considering the challenge of broadly canceling student debt PERIOD

More broadbased student loan forgiveness could run into more legal problems require legislative action or could be reduced by future Republican administrations and taking it in a more nuanced and specific way is more important Schaeffler wrote PERIOD In essence this structure allows for those truly wronged by predatory lenders or other more urgent situations to be targeted and have their loans forgiven a much more succinct process. in his statement from The White House Biden said the current extension would be the final one PERIOD After Jan PERIOD  borrowers would have to be prepared to start repaying their loan payments PERIOD

Schaeffler said he believes the Biden administrations timing and forgiveness measures of the extension was greatly needed given the pandemic PERIOD

As job numbers continue to grow and the impacts of COVID19 continue to slowly subside I believe that this extension is fair Schaeffler wrote PERIOD However as we get closer to January  we will see how appropriate another extension would be there is probably not a specific time that would be good to restart payments so this timing being a few months from now is as good a time as possible. on this point Arun said she disagrees with putting a cap on the moratorium PERIOD She said she believes decisions shouldnt be made when the trajectory and full impact of the pandemic is unknown PERIOD Because loans are a significant burden even without the impacts of a pandemic Arun said considering postgrad education in a time of COVID19 uncertainty is unknown and anxietyinducing PERIOD

Im scared for myself in terms of postgrad Arun said PERIOD I will not have the financial capability to just pay that in full without a loan PERIOD So that is something that provokes fear in me. considering the Biden administrations student debt forgiveness has topped . billion so far Schaeffler said he believes Biden is fully committed to achieving students loan relief and fighting for their education PERIOD

Biden supports and has proposed a legislative package that would include free undergraduate tuition for students from families who make less than  Schaeffler wrote PERIOD He has proposed nearly  billion of spending pertaining to education including  billion for child care and universal prekindergarten programs as well as funding for school infrastructure and free community college. arun said given the Biden campaigns support for immediate  forgiveness per student borrower she believes Biden has still not delivered enough on forgiving student loans PERIOD

That was one of his promises and he still hasnt followed through on that campaign promise Arun said PERIOD I think there is room in the budget to cover the cost of education especially higher education. daily Staff Reporter Justine Ra can be reached at rjustineumich.edu PERIOD
