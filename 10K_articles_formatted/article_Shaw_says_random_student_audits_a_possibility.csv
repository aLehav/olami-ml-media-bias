5263,2010-07-22,"this fall the Office of Undergraduate Admission is expected to maintain the status quo  save for two main changes PERIOD The office will bring on board a newly revamped admission staff after losing seven admission officers this year and will decide whether or not to put a random auditing system in place PERIOD

The latter change likely stems from Stanfords admission of Adam B PERIOD Wheeler the ousted Harvard student who falsified his college applications and nabbed more than  in scholarships and financial aid PERIOD Stanford has since rescinded Wheelers acceptance PERIOD

Richard Shaw dean of Undergraduate Admission declined to comment on Adam Wheelers connection to Stanford citing guidelines that prevent the disclosure of an individual applicants personal information PERIOD However the Huffington Post last month reported that Shaw confirmed Wheelers admission to a Harvard detective PERIOD

Shaw was more open about the means by which Stanford plans to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future PERIOD

We are actually engaged in the consideration of audits of our undergraduate student body Shaw said of the Office of Undergraduate Admission PERIOD

The issue of dishonesty and forgery on the national level is of concern he added PERIOD I dont think its widespread but it certainly brings our attention to the need to implement or think about implementing procedures that would result in random audits. shaw said that his office is examining the merit of random audits this summer and might over the next period of time implement something like that  even through next year. the introduction of such precautions however may prove to be a doubleedged sword PERIOD For Shaw its a balancing act between two principles trust and vigilance PERIOD

The admission office lives by the tenet that most students tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth when they sign off on their applications Shaw said PERIOD However he acknowledged that young people are dishonest from time to time and that his office is cautious about stamping out such behaviors PERIOD

Its an awesome task to hold accountable  applicants Shaw said PERIOD

Aside from the possibility of a new auditing system the Office of Undergraduate Admission will also welcome several new faces to its staff this fall following the departure of seven admission officers during the  academic year PERIOD

The most publicized departures were those of former Director of Admission Shawn Abbott and former Assistant Dean of Admission Dan Warner PERIOD Abbott left to serve as the new assistant vice president for undergraduate admissions at New York University PERIOD Warner opted to become the new director of admission at Rice University PERIOD

Of the remaining departures three elected to attend graduate school one chose to become a department chair at a secondary school and one will serve on the administrative staff of Semester at Sea PERIOD

Although losing seven staff members is a higherthanusual turnover rate Shaw noted that departures are in general normal PERIOD Younger staff members commit to a minimum of two years with the Office of Undergraduate Admission oftentimes to determine whether they want to go to graduate school or try something else Shaw said PERIOD

I had a wonderful experience at Stanford and enjoyed every aspect of my life on the Farm Abbott wrote in an email to The Daily supporting Shaws claim PERIOD My move to NYU was only inspired by my desire to take on a more significant leadership role within a university that isnt already at the top. shaw said that losing seven of  admission officers would not pose any difficulties this upcoming school year PERIOD

With  onboard who can provide continuity I think well be just fine Shaw said PERIOD Weve hired a spectacular new group  who are extremely intelligent and capable PERIOD I think theyll all hit the ground running. the admission office however still is looking for Abbotts replacement PERIOD The search for a director of admission Shaw said is a longer one PERIOD
