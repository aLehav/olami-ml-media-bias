8446,2023-11-05,"progress PERIOD Progress is the fuel of life its what powers all forward movement what powers ideas  and it is one of the foundational ideals of our nation PERIOD This is a nation that revolted to be ruled by its population and as it spread its democratic ideals was seen as progress itself PERIOD However we all know how this progression was fueled off the backs of Indigenous peoples and Black Americans as their communities were destroyed and the United States of America bragged about its incredible progress PERIOD As the United States set industry standards worldwide the demographics who built it stagnated under oppression and destruction losing the ability to catch up PERIOD

So what does progress mean to Black America What does it mean for Black Americans We live in a nation that viewed our ancestors as stepping stones  objects used to generate revenue discarded after use PERIOD When slavery ended and we could no longer be used we were separated quarantined away from the rest of the population as a threat to society an unnecessary part of the American fabric like takeout containers after youve eaten all the food PERIOD Black America was forced to sacrifice everything for American progress  and were told to be thankful for the opportunity to be used by such a progressive nation PERIOD

Black America has seen the doublesidedness of American progression PERIOD There was an obsession with the Second Amendment  until the Black Panthers held guns in defense at the Capitol PERIOD Until Philando Castile was underneath an officer begging for breath because he may have had a gun PERIOD We have seen how important progress is until it is our progression  how the First Amendment allows the flying of Confederate flags beside highways but doesnt allow Colin Kaepernick to kneel PERIOD America stuffs its ideals of progression down our throats then slaps us in the face when we ask for the same freedoms PERIOD

Analyzing the economic differences between Black and White America makes this difference in progress even more obvious  when you read statistics that say in  the median net worth of a Black family was  while the median net worth of a white family was  PERIOD When you read statistics concerning maternity mortality rates health care access and homeownership rates PERIOD You can see it in every facet of our country  way too many for me to outline in a 600word letter PERIOD

The gaps between Black and white Americans have been obvious for years  and attempts to close them have been made PERIOD However all of these attempts focus on Black people digging ourselves out of the pit as a community PERIOD There is nothing wrong with community advocacy and working to close these gaps  but we need to remember that Black people did not cause this gap PERIOD The suffering of Black America was created by American progress  a progression that relied on our oppression to continue PERIOD The inequities Black America experiences are not just side effects  they are intentionally engineered so America can keep benefiting at our expense PERIOD Our oppression fuels American progress it always has PERIOD

When it comes to progress for Black America what is needed is reparations PERIOD Repairing the damage that the Black community has experienced is the only way to tackle the oppression that we experience on a systemic level PERIOD It is the only way for Black America to experience progress in a nation built off of our losses our destruction and our oppression PERIOD
