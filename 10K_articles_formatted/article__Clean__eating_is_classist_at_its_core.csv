Grocery stores nowadays are inundated with products touting profound health benefits PERIOD The shelves are increasingly lined with the latest superfood sugarfree organic breads and berries of a health nuts dreams PERIOD When you leave the supermarket and jump onto social media it just gets worse PERIOD Influencer after influencer promoting raw diets juice cleanses and every other dietary fad is flooding feeds with popular slogans like cleaneating yielding more than  million posts on Instagram and  million views on TikTok PERIOD

The alluring advertising of these products sold in colorful and trendy packaging coupled with the perfectly built individuals promoting them online makes it hard to not fall into line with this clean food trend PERIOD After all why wouldnt you want to look like a model all while healing your gut Suddenly youre heading back to the supermarket and stacking your cart with zerocarb bread and that green powder that will hopefully give you rockhard abs because the model and personal trainer from Los Angeles that showed up on your feed told you so PERIOD

Beyond the fact that social media has lied to you  and those influencers have abs because working out is their job  you run into another problem Health foods are expensive PERIOD Like really expensive PERIOD What used to be a . loaf of Great Value white bread in your cart is now a . loaf of Ezekiel sprouted whole grain bread PERIOD Add in the . bottle of Bloom Nutrition Powder and youre done for PERIOD

This issue cuts deeper than swapping out your breads though PERIOD The idolization of these trendy health foods comes with a consequential and often unspoken demonization of unclean foods PERIOD Processed readymade and caloriedense foods are often viewed unfavorably as society strives to solely eat the fresh and lean foods associated with clean diets PERIOD Another critically important quality of these frownedupon foods is their status as staples in lowincome diets PERIOD

In looking at this relationship between income and diet the Harvard School of Public Health found that on average eating a healthy diet costs . more per day totaling  extra per year PERIOD This is no minor burden on many lowincome households PERIOD Households with low socioeconomic status tend to spend less money on food PERIOD Due to the higher cost of healthy foods these families buy more unhealthy foods and beverages than fruits and vegetables PERIOD A closer look at which foods different lowincome groups consume reveals that the foods stereotypically deemed unclean  including fatty meats canned foods cereals and white bread  are more often purchased by lowincome households PERIOD

The convenience lower price and availability of unclean foods all drive lowincome households to base much of their diet around unhealthy foods PERIOD Though many trendy foods may very well be more nutrientdense or have fresher ingredients than processed foods purchasing these foods is simply not feasible for many PERIOD Meeting caloric needs generally takes precedence over nutritional value for a majority of lowincome households PERIOD As if making this sacrifice to prioritize caloric intake is not burdensome enough the impacts of a highcalorie lownutrientdense diet on health are yet another strain on lowincome households a strain that comes with stigma PERIOD

Lowincome individuals are often shamed for the health effects that processed diets may have PERIOD Obesity  despite being an issue that grips roughly  of American adults  is a commonly misconstrued health condition with blame often being put on those struggling with it PERIOD In analyzing geographic area poverty the CDC found that a higher percentage of poverty was associated with a higher rate of obesity PERIOD According to research published by the American Diabetes Association American counties with poverty rates higher than  may even have obesity rates  higher than higherincome counties PERIOD While some claim that this is a wholly reverse causal relationship in that obesity creates a lower income rather than a lower income causing obesity it is likely that in highly developed countries like the United States the relationship goes both ways PERIOD An aspect of reverse causation in the relationship between income and obesity would actually only make this a more vicious cycle as nutritious foods are unattainable for those struggling with their health because of initial lack of access to nutritious foods PERIOD

Some may argue that the price disparities between clean and unclean foods are due to their varying ingredients PERIOD It is true that unhealthy foods are often cheaper than healthy foods meat and dairy subsidies combined with the seasonal nature of fresh produce form this disparity in cost between food types PERIOD When compared calorie for calorie however it is clear that healthy foods are often subject to greater fluxes of inflation and likely arbitrary markups amid rising health food trends PERIOD Research from the University of Washington found that lowcalorie healthy foods were more likely to experience inflated prices with costs of these foods increasing . during the twoyear study PERIOD Highcalorie unhealthy food prices remained predictable actually decreasing in cost by . pERIOD

So is the fact that trendy clean foods are much pricier simply an accident I dont think so PERIOD This convenient trend of shaming the inflexible dietary choices of lowerincome households is just a new way of creating separation between classes PERIOD Propagating a trend that centers around a seemingly purely positive way of living and then making it only available to those with a high income is simply a colorful revamp of the same tired classism that is seen time and time again in social trends PERIOD The influencers promoting their latest superfood sponsorship may not realize the enduring scheme of class division that they are contributing to and the consumers buying in are probably even more clueless but the harm in this kind of social precedent is no less impactful PERIOD

Im not saying that you shouldnt buy a protein bar or sprouted bread next time youre at the store  being mindful of what youre consuming is a positive thing PERIOD But if you choose white bread out of sheer preference or cant afford otherwise then you shouldnt have to feel ashamed PERIOD Food is food regardless of what that model on TikTok tells you PERIOD Its time we stop using food as another vehicle to justify high socioeconomic status superiority and start eating what we want PERIOD
