Updated November     pm



The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part  the SciFi adventure film starring Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth premiered in theaters last weekend PERIOD

This film specifically focuses on Lawrences character Katniss Everdeen who is the face of the Panem rebellion PERIOD Throughout the entire movie Everdeen Lawrence defies the rebel leader PERIOD The rebel leader wants Katniss to only be the face of the rebellion but Katniss wants to be on the main front fighting in the rebellion PERIOD

There is also twist in regards to romance portrayed in the film PERIOD Katniss who was viciously attacked at the end of Mockingjay Part  by her former friend and lover spends the entire movie trying to help Hutchersons character Peeta regain his memory PERIOD It is now about regaining trust between one another PERIOD

Mockingjay Part  is the final movie in The Hunger Games series and did not leave the audience disappointed PERIOD

Meredith Nale junior business administration major said she felt the film met her expectations PERIOD She said she felt real emotions when certain characters died and she believes the death created more dislike towards a certain leader which was a major plot turning point in the movie PERIOD

It was very suspenseful and moved the story very well Nale said PERIOD I feel like it ended the series okay. nale went to the Thursday  p.m PERIOD showing at Hollywood Premier Cinemas in Starkville PERIOD She said there was a huge turnout that caused the lobby to be congested while the crowd waited to enter the screening rooms PERIOD

The Hunger Games series is one of the most popular of its time due to the many different meanings it gives the audience members PERIOD Everdeens character is rare because she is a female hero PERIOD

According to New York Times author Manohla Dargis the girlwoman who is fighting for a better Panem is aspirational as well as inspirational PERIOD Women often play sleazy or damsel in distress characters making the female hero a legendary character PERIOD

The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part  was a great way to end The Hunger Games series with its suspense female lead and the way the plot emotionally engaged the audience PERIOD The film is rated PG13 due to its apocalyptic violence and is  hours and  minutes of suspense PERIOD
