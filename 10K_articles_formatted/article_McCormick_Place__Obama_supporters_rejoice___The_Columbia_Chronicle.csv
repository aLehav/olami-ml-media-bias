President Barack Obama has been reelected to a second term in the White House beating opponent Mitt Romney after a lengthy and heated battle PERIOD

Screams erupted from the crowd at McCormick Place as several news organizations pegged Obama victorious in Ohio a key swing state which gave him enough electoral votes to secure the presidency PERIOD

According to network projections the only swing state Romney won was North Carolina despite making Election Day stops in Ohio and Pennsylvania PERIOD Obama however also secured wins in Pennsylvania Wisconsin Iowa and New Hampshire PERIOD

Shortly after the projected election outcome was announced the Obama campaign tweeted Four more years along with a photo of him hugging first lady Michelle Obama which became the most popular tweet of all time in a matter of roughly  minutes PERIOD

The audience at McCormick Place grew increasingly energetic after the announcement as supporters screamed and danced in support of Obama PERIOD

Im so proud of that guy for winning again said Scott Mosley whose company provides sign language interpreters for the Obama campaign PERIOD He stands for everything I believe in and Im so proud. many who served as campaign volunteers during election season were invited to attend Obamas campaign event as a way to repay them for their services PERIOD

Annie Cappetta who worked as a phone bank coordinator said she has been working for the past several weeks to encourage voters to support Obama PERIOD She said she worked to the point of exhaustion as part of the campaigns final push to appeal to voters PERIOD

Other volunteers such as Matthew Johnson feel a sense of relief following Obamas reelection PERIOD

I think that Obama is taking the country on a really reasonable path and is working for everybody not just those who already have a lot of wealth and power Johnson said PERIOD Had the election gone the other way I feel Mitt Romney would have allowed more unfair practices on Wall Street and extended the Bush tax cuts PERIOD The wealthy already have so much of the power in this country and arent paying their share but thankfully Romney didnt win. while the crowd was brimming with excitement audience members remained conscious of the fact that there is still much work to be done PERIOD

Its going to be an excellent four years said Lynn Kamenitsa an Obama supporter PERIOD Obama is going to have a chance to finish what he started PERIOD We still have a tough road ahead toward economic recovery but hes the best man for the job. chronicle TV Episode
