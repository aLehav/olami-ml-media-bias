On April  Stony Brook University held a town hall following the University winning a proposal to build a new campus on Governors Island that will focus on researching and developing solutions to the climate crisis PERIOD

The discussion was moderated by Stony Brook alumnus Craig Allen  chief meteorologist for WCBS880 PERIOD The panelists were President Maurie McInnis Associate Dean for Research and Associate Professor Kevin Reed of the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences Associate Vice President of Campus Planning Design and Construction William Herrmann and Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration Jed Shivers PERIOD

The town hall opened with McInniss remarks on the Universitys success in winning the proposal PERIOD

A lot of this is still sinking in just a little over just a little bit more than  hours after the official announcement from New York Citys Mayor Eric Adams that Stony Brooks historic plan to reimagine Governors Island as an international hub for convening client climate science research and solutions was revealed as the winner she said PERIOD

She then described how the New York Climate Exchange would benefit from pledged support from multiple groups that had pledged to contribute financial resources to the project PERIOD

Two of the worlds leading philanthropic organizations the Simons Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropies have pledged to combine  million in support of the New York Climate Exchange McInnis said PERIOD

Stony Brook competed for the ability to lead the project with both the City University of New York CUNY and Northeastern University PERIOD McInnis pointed out that Stony Brook having the winning proposal selected by the New York City government strengthened the Universitys status as a flagship university in the State University of New York SUNY system a distinction it obtained early last year along with the University at Buffalo PERIOD

The Exchanges financial status was also a big talking point in the Town Hall meeting PERIOD

During the town hall the panelists explained that the exchange would not be financially linked to Stony Brook University and instead be labeled as its own 501c3 nonprofit organization PERIOD This would prevent Stony Brook from directly putting money into the project and stop The Exchange from being a strain on the Universitys finances PERIOD

The Exchange is a separate and distinct charitable organization licensed to do business in the state of New York Shivers said PERIOD Its going to have its own assets PERIOD Its going to have its own liabilities PERIOD Its going to have its own management PERIOD And its own board of directors which represents the participating higher education institutions corporations and other organizations. shivers said the board of directors responsible for running the New York Climate Exchange will be selected through a collaboration between the institutions running the facility PERIOD However as the anchor institution Stony Brook will be responsible for filling half of the seats PERIOD

Stony Brooks role will be as the principal appointing authority it will assume that role for at least the first  years and have  of seats Shivers said PERIOD Initially Stony Brook will have seven seats with the remaining seven coming from the other participating organizations PERIOD In addition the Stony Brook University President will be chairman of the board for the first two threeyear terms

Another component of the town hall was the discussion on how the exchange would be constructed in order to withstand future environmental challenges PERIOD The panelists said the buildings will be designed to withstand future storm surges and the campus will come equipped with walls to block threats from rising sea levels PERIOD The campus will also be designed to preserve the islands past including amenities like a historical center PERIOD

The campus will also include scientific laboratories though when asked by an audience member if the labs will host a particular type of research Reed did not give a specific answer PERIOD

When theres work that can particularly make use of the coastal urban environment or can make use of space directly on the island to demonstrate and test new technology thats the type of laboratory space that will be available he said PERIOD

When Jonathan Sanders a professor in the School of Communication and Journalism asked how the committee responsible for the exchange was planning on making sure the construction of the campus did not add to carbon emissions McInnis did not directly answer his question saying details on all of that forthcoming. francis Lawrence an incoming graduate student studying anthropology who attended the town hall said he was curious about where the project was headed PERIOD

It certainly seems ambitious Lawrence said PERIOD I didnt have much knowledge of it coming in and I certainly learned a lot today PERIOD Im curious to see where it goes as it continues to develop. sky Crabtree is an assistant news editor for The Statesman and a sophomore studying journalism and political science PERIOD He joined the paper in the spring of  as a news reporter and was promoted at the end of the same semester PERIOD Outside of The Statesman you can catch him reporting on WUSBs weekly news show and as a member of the Stony Brook Media Group PERIOD
