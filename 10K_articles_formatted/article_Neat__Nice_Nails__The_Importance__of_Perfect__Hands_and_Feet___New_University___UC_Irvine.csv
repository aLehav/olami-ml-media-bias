2625,2023-11-04,"well this month I have been tackling the topic of footwear   needless to say with my wide Rainbow sandals collection that it is not exactly my expertise PERIOD I have however been thinking about the importance of neatly manicured hands and feet an awful lot PERIOD

Shoes are notably quintessential accessories that are a part of every outfit but whats inside of those shoes is just important as the shoes themselves PERIOD

Hands and feet literally drive the way we move throughout the world so why are they ignored Not only is there an aesthetic quality to wellgroomed hands and feet but there are also health benefits that make the occasional manipedi worth it PERIOD

Aside from the tactile nature of hands and feet holistic approaches to medicine focus on hands and feet PERIOD Why you might ask Because they are essential to circulation of the bodys blood and also are the storage centers of many nerves PERIOD Thus keeping your hands and feet healthy can help keep the rest of your body healthy as well PERIOD Keeping free of hangnails and other cuts can prevent major infections of the blood that normally arise from the things we touch in the world PERIOD

Girls you clearly have more experience with nail care so lets modernize it into this spring PERIOD First keep your nails close PERIOD I dont entirely know where the talon trend began where long nails dominate but thinking realistically for the fastpace life we live in keep your nails no longer than . times the length of your nail bed PERIOD This will allow you to keep the feminine flair but retain the functionality of being able to type PERIOD

Bright spring colors and prints are in PERIOD However if you are less enthusiastic about bold colors then keep it simple PERIOD Nude tone lacquers dont draw too much attention but give your nails a healthy appearance PERIOD Or if you are looking for an interesting pattern try the new ombr trend with dual tone colors PERIOD There is a whole world of nail care that can be explored nowadays through the use of YouTube so if you are looking for some inspiration check out a friend of mine httpwww.youtube.comuserlauralyla PERIOD Her unique designs like her Facebook nails definitely deserve a like. guys lets get real PERIOD Im not expecting any of us to hit up the nail salon PERIOD Keeping your hands and feet nice and neat however is far beyond aesthetics PERIOD For the inner businessman a job can be sealed with a handshake so why have hands and feet that look like hoofs Make sure your nails are trimmed and smooth and PLEASE do not chew your nails PERIOD Its not only a nasty habit but as unsanitary as it gets PERIOD

For the inner player its simple ladies may like athletes but they dont want men with catchers mitts for hands PERIOD This has a simple solution keep your hands and feet moisturized with lotion PERIOD

Nail care and keeping your hands and feet neat are simple tasks that not only can improve your health but also your social quality of life PERIOD

If all else fails spend a little extra on an amazing pair of shoes  and wear mittens the latter being less of an acceptable alternative PERIOD Keep things clean neat and as always fashionable PERIOD
