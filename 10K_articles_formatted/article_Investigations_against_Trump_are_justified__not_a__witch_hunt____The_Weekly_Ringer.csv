This past week Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi began an impeachment  inquiry into President Donald J PERIOD Trump. like the majority of his  responses the presidents comment was delivered in a simple tweet End  the Witch Hunt now

The actions of President Trump displayed 
over the past three and a half years show a consistent trend of putting 
the self over the country PERIOD

The Mueller Report was completed this
 past March and a redacted version was released to the public on April 
  PERIOD While President Trump mocked the report and said it was a 
partisan hit job he failed to remember that Robert Mueller himself was a
 Republican who was appointed to the national scene when George W PERIOD Bush 
made him the United States Deputy Attorney General in  PERIOD

The 
Mueller Report outlined ten instances of possible obstruction of 
justice PERIOD Firing FBI Director James Comey at the beginning of his 
investigation into Trump and making an effort to prevent certain pieces 
of evidence from reaching the public were two obstructions addressed PERIOD

Even
 after the whole public testimony of Special Counsel Robert Mueller 
some American people still believe the investigation was a witch hunt PERIOD 
Some are still wondering how people could continue to support Trump and
 it is not a simple answer PERIOD It could be attributed to lack of awareness
 or because the President uses his Twitter to spread false attacks and 
Fox News pushes the narrative in the Presidents favor PERIOD

The 
release of the Mueller Report is not the only instance in which the term
 witch hunt was used PERIOD This past week news broke that a whistleblower 
report was filed to the Inspector General about the potential abuse of 
power PERIOD This time the response was the same from Trump but the polls 
slowly moved in favor of impeachment from the American public PERIOD

This
 says a lot about the type of behavior that the President has been apart
 of not just during his  campaign until this week but since Trump 
became a business mogul PERIOD

Trump has always gotten himself into 
shady business dealings PERIOD Hes made a habit of deflecting from the main 
issue at hand whether it be not releasing his tax returns or going on 
Twitter to blow off some steam at  a.m PERIOD

In an article released 
in May of this year by The New Yorker John Cassidy said Trumps 
core businesses racked up losses of more than a billion dollars in a 
tenyear period. this is the type of action that is common for Trump to
 partake in making the media and people believe that youre the richest
 and best businessman in the world when in reality you are quite 
literally the worst PERIOD

This is especially dangerous when the 
President used his success as a businessman to supplement why 
Americans should vote for him PERIOD

When asked about if the view of 
Trumps business impacted his view of the election in  senior 
English major Joe Langley responded  at first I thought it would be 
interesting to have someone with a business background run the country 
but over time with information about his taxes and bankruptciesit 
made me question if it is really a good idea to run the country like a 
Trump Casino. langleys sentiment reflects how a lot of people 
are feeling now PERIOD Especially the independent voter to have a sitting 
President begin to abuse his power to cover up his taxes and crimes he 
has committed PERIOD

The question of impeachment has arisen and it 
should be done PERIOD It should be done for two main reasons to open up 
investigations and look deeper into Trumps financial record and 
because we have impeached presidents before just for mere social 
issues PERIOD His actions set a precedent that would make open abuses of power
 okay as well as using political positions to turn personal business 
profits PERIOD

Senior communication and digital studies major Alex 
Caldas said I believe the impeachment inquiry is validTrump has 
been completely unjust throughout his presidency and was bound to do 
something to get him impeached from the very start. caldas also stated 
that Trump likely doesnt know what most of the laws are so he wont 
even know he broke them PERIOD Thats why the President feels like its a 
witch hunt. only Trump would ask a favor from the Ukrainian 
president to have them investigate his political opponents while 
withholding aid to the country PERIOD

Even after all the Mueller 
investigation one would think Trump would act differently PERIOD Through the 
last three years it has become apparent that all the noise coming from 
the White House that the investigations are no witch hunt but a fight 
to preserve the sacred office that the president holds PERIOD The president 
should put the country before politics PERIOD The best interests of the people
 first not himself PERIOD Only the guilty go to great lengths to cover up their crimes

He has been the first President to support gay rights before becoming President brought North and South Korea closer to peace focuses on bringing back jobs and factories to the States PERIOD He has been trying to pull forces out of the MiddleEast cut back HEAVILY on drone strikes in the region and is doing all this while constantly attacked and smeared by the mediagovernment far beyond any other President in recent history PERIOD He has my support PERIOD
