8744,2015-07-20,"ahhh summer PERIOD Time for inappropriately short shorts and socially acceptable public drinking PERIOD A time for most students to take a little breather from the insanity of the school year PERIOD

By midJuly though summer can be boring PERIOD You can only set off so many fireworks in public parks before that gets old PERIOD Drinking yourself silly becomes like pass by August PERIOD But what else is there to do with your free time You cant break out your phone at Sauvie Island for fear of getting sand in the cracks PERIOD So why not break out a book and make your own headmovie instead of reading another trite Elite Daily article

As a college student it probably seems like sacrilege to suggest that youreadduring your limited free time what with all the reading you do in school but I promise that if you play your cards right reading can actually befun PERIOD

For the Overworked College Student The Psychopath Testby Jon Ronson

A book just for you burntout psychology major PERIOD Your brain needs a break PERIOD Youre sick of reading thick textbooks bogged down by complicated sentence structure and jargon PERIOD All that jargon PERIOD Even if youre not actually a psych major overworked college student you probably armchair diagnose people anyways so you might as well read a humorous pop psychology book PERIOD

Ronsons writing is accessible in a readingtheWikipediapage kind of way PERIOD InThe Psychopath Test youll find an emotional checklist and stories about psychopaths as low on the food chain as the Englishman who faked mental illness in order to avoid prison but ended up in a maximum security psych ward anyway and as scarily powerful as corporate downsizer Albert J PERIOD Dunlap PERIOD

Ronson also grapples right along with the reader with whether or not he himself is a psychopath PERIOD

Its kind of like reading a book by your anxietyridden neighbor who is unintentionally funny in his pathological selfconsciousness PERIOD

Not for you TryRational Mysticismby Jon Hogan PERIOD A quick read on the science behind hallucinogenic drugs PERIOD Fascinating to read on mushrooms if you can keep the words from jumping up atyou PERIOD

For the Autodidact The Beak of the Finchby Jonathan Weiner

Youre a gogetter PERIOD You dont need asyllabusto tell you how or what to learn PERIOD But at the same time you probably dont want to crack open a textbook if you can avoidit PERIOD

This  winner of the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction is for the person who actually wants to exercise his brain without reading a technical manual of some sort PERIOD Do you like science And not the picturesofspaceNeilde GrasseTyson kind of science but actual science You know the smallstuff hypotheses years of research and whathaveyou PERIOD

Weiners narrative follows married biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant while they study finches on Daphne Major trying to figure out exactly how much Darwin got right PERIOD Hint a lot but he seriously underestimated the gravity of his own observations. you need to have a cursory understanding of biological terms and definitions but you dont need a degree in biology PERIOD Not to mention Weiner is particularly adept at creating narrative tension so youre constantly on the edge of yourseat PERIOD

Not for you If youre either offended by evolution or its just not your thing take a gamble at Mary Roachs Bonk PERIOD Read about sex while learning Its a winwin you dirty thing you PERIOD Or if Bonk doesnt work for you try reading some Snapple facts or something I dontknow PERIOD

To be honest though this one is a literary feat that takes time and hard work to read PERIOD Dont be surprised if you have a couple of false starts before you can get into the rhythm of tennisalcoholismcommercialism PERIOD If you really dont care about going out into the sunlight and youre looking to take on a project this summer I highly suggest thisbook PERIOD

Not for you TryBluetsby Maggie Nelson PERIOD Not only is it shortermuch shorterbut its a hybrid form prosepoem that combines philosophy personal narrative and research PERIOD To boot Nelson is just now gaining national attention so shes not yet bogged down by that lame cult of personality that DFW suffers from PERIOD

For the Celebrity WorshipperIV A Decade of Curious People and Dangerous Ideasby Chuck Klosterman

Youre embarrassed to be seen with Us Weekly as you probably should be PERIOD But you still want to read about rich people PERIOD Thats fine PERIOD Theres something for everyone PERIOD

Klosterman ofSex Drugs and Cocoa Puffsfame is particularly gifted at writing about famous people in unexpected ways PERIOD His profiles arent the typical shes wearing boyfriend jeans and a tshirt and she picks at her spinach salad while laughing openly celebrity circlejerks PERIOD No this is the man who wrote that M.I.A PERIOD complained about thirdworld poverty while eating overpriced truffle fries in a fivestar hotel PERIOD

This is an actual book that wont give away your creepy obsession with people you will never meet PERIOD Also Klosterman has included in this collection some of his smarter essays on pop culture ephemera PERIOD Star Wars is overrated People go on REO Speedwagon and Styx cruises

Not for you Try anyNew Yorkercelebrity profile PERIOD Youll be reading theNew Yorker which is shorthand for cultural intelligence or whatever while simultaneously feeding your need to read about people youve never and will never meet in yourlife PERIOD

If you read this book you will have the privilege of spending a day in the life of Portlandbased Isabel PERIOD Shes a mousy stereotypical hipster librarian who sifts through damaged books all day wanders around in a haze of hope and loneliness and goes to parties where people sit in circles and tell each other sad stories PERIOD She also hardly speaks a word and yet youre supposed to relate to her PERIOD Glaciersis wellwrittenstylish if you willbut very bland kind of like the protagonist PERIOD But hey its only 100pages PERIOD

Oh Jack PERIOD He knew how to live didnt he His level of knowing how to live is inversely proportional to his level of knowing how to end a goddamn sentence PERIOD

If you like the idea of wheeling your way around the country going from place to place scamming everyone you meet in the name of freedom youll love this book PERIOD Just remember to take deep breaths before the really long sentences PERIOD

Not for you Try One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest by Ken Kesey PERIOD Linguistic playfulness romanticism of the struggle that is life and an author whose mythos is bigger than his books PERIOD This one is slightly more palatable than On the Road to our cynical readers PERIOD
