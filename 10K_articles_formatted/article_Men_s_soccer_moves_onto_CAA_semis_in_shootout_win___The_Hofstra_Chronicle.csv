Griebsch did not waste any time as he quickly deposited a low shot into the right side of the net to give the Pride a   in penalties win PERIOD
Its the best feeling ever Griebsch said. i cant describe it Im so happy I felt so relieved afterwards. griebsch hit the game winner but it took a team effort to get the win after all of the Prides penalty attempts were successful PERIOD
