Our View



Situation

The DEN has endorsed candidates John McCain and Barack Obama.Stance

Students should vote for either of these candidates tomorrow because they will serve Americas best interests PERIOD

DEMOCRATS

Barack the Vote If you are a registered Democrat in this state you should vote in Tuesdays primary PERIOD

And you should vote for Sen PERIOD Barack Obama PERIOD

Economy Obamas economic plan focuses on the middle class PERIOD He has pledged a tax cut for  million workers in the United States PERIOD The tax credit will be up to  dollars per person or  per working family PERIOD

Obamas plan will offset the payroll tax on the first  of a familys earnings PERIOD

The tax cut would completely eliminate income taxes for  million Americans PERIOD

Obama also plans to create a universal mortgage credit expand the Income Tax Credit eliminate income tax for seniors making less than  and simplify tax returns PERIOD

There is no better way to strengthen the economy than returning money to hardworking American citizens PERIOD

Iraq Obama opposed the war from the start something his opponent cannot claim PERIOD

In  he proposed legislation that would end the war in Iraq with a phased withdrawal engaged in combat operations PERIOD If elected Obama has pledged to begin removing troops from Iraq immediately PERIOD

Obamas plan consists of removing one to two combat brigades each month and have all combat brigades out of Iraq within  months PERIOD

While Obama has a clear plan to withdraw troops his opponent has promised to come up with a plan to remove troops from the region upon being elected PERIOD It is better to choose a candidate who already has a plan PERIOD

Action is key to ending the war in Iraq and bringing thousands of our troops home PERIOD

Education Obama has promised to make college affordable something all college students should support PERIOD

Obama has pledged to create a new American Opportunity Tax Credit PERIOD

The credit would be universal and fully refundable and would ensure that the first  of a college education is free for most Americans PERIOD

Obama has also pledged to streamline the financial aid process by eliminating the current application system and enabling families to apply by checking a box on their tax forms PERIOD

By allowing more families and students the opportunity for a cheaper college education Obama is creating a brighter future for America PERIOD

Conclusion We are urging the democratic voters of Illinois to look at Obama listen to his message and realize that he is the person who should lead the Democratic Party in the national election in November PERIOD It is time to pass the torch to a new leader and Obama is that leader PERIOD

REPUBLICANS

Board the Straight Talk Express If you are a registered Republican in this state you should also vote in Tuesdays primary PERIOD

And you should vote for Sen PERIOD John McCain PERIOD

Economy McCains promise is to be fiscally responsible as president PERIOD

He plans to end pork barrel spending and increase transparency with governmental spending PERIOD

He believes that Americans have the right to know where their tax dollars are being spent PERIOD

McCain has pledged to end the excessive borrowing and spending that has become a governmental normalcy PERIOD

Iraq One of McCains campaign pillars is the fact that he has military experience PERIOD

He has laid forth a strategy for Victory in Iraq. some people may feel the best way to end the war is with immediate withdrawal PERIOD But out of all the Republican candidates McCain seems to have the best plan for continuing and finishing the war in Iraq PERIOD

McCain has pledged to increase troops on the ground PERIOD

McCain claims that more troops are necessary to clear and hold insurgent strongholds to provide security for rebuilding Iraq and to give

Iraqis the capabilities to eventually govern and secure their own country PERIOD

McCain has also pledged to implement a new counterinsurgency strategy strengthen the Iraqi Armed Forces and Police and accelerate political and economic reconstruction PERIOD
