The director of the Latin Native American Cultural Center organized a free prePowwow event taking place from  to  p.m PERIOD Friday in C20 Pomerantz Career Center PERIOD

My goal is to bring in nonNative Americans to the performance to learn more about the culture Orticelli said PERIOD

One group of participants highschool students from the Upward Bound program will be offered a dinner at the Cultural Center as a welcome before the event PERIOD

Orticelli said she was able to put together a bigger and better event than expected because of funding from numerous organizations PERIOD Native Pride Dancers from Minnesota playing flutes and drums dancing and telling stories of their heritage will be the main act PERIOD Also featured will be an interactive history of the Powwow and a questionandanswer session PERIOD

After the kickoff on Friday night festivities will continue at the UI Recreation Building PERIOD The dancing drumming and Native American cultural celebration will be held with three sessions noon to  p.m PERIOD and  p.m PERIOD to midnight on Saturday and noon to  p.m PERIOD April  PERIOD The organization hopes to draw a large crowd PERIOD

What we are really trying to do is bring it back to its former glory said Orriena Snyder a member of the Latin Native American Cultural Center and an event planner PERIOD

Before the  Hours show and Dance Marathon grew large followings the annual Native American Powwow was the biggest studentrun event on campus PERIOD

Orticelli and Snyder agree it is important to bring in new people who havent been to an event such as this or are not part of the Native American community PERIOD Healthy competition is a good way to persuade people to attend they said PERIOD

The Powwow runs like a dance competition PERIOD Groups of dancers perform in traditional Native American styles against others in the same category Snyder said PERIOD

Although the Native American population at the UI is small it is growing and members planning the event hope for a successful turn out PERIOD

The group of about  planning the event said it is a lot of work but well worth it Snyder said PERIOD

Orticelli hopes the prePowwow will encourage people to attend the weekend event and that it will lead into days of cultural recognition PERIOD

We are trying to reignite that passion and hoping to get the community involved Snyder said PERIOD",A Native American Powwow - The Daily Iowan,University of Iowa
