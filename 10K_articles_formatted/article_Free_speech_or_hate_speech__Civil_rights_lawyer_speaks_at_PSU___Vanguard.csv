8741,2017-04-02,"when Joe Cohn legislative and policy director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education brought his dialogue concerning free speech on college campuses to Portland State on March  the civil rights attorney focused on two central points PERIOD

Firstly Cohn wants students to know that the right to free speech applies in full force on public university and college campuses PERIOD Students at public institutions of higher education have fully vested First Amendment and other constitutional rights PERIOD

For his second point Cohn focused on the importance of being able to speak your mind and hear others speak theirs PERIOD

The driving engine of advancement
Free speech has been the driving engine that has led to virtually every advancement in civil rightsfrom womens suffrage to desegregationin our countrys history every single one Cohn said PERIOD The importance of free speech to a democratic society cant be overstated PERIOD If you dont vigorously defend freedom of speech on the college campus we will condition future generations to accept that censorship is normal routine and that maybe it is even desirable. watch highlights from Joe Cohns lecture on free speech issues in higher education PERIOD Video by Dylan GansenPSU Vanguard

The group Cohn represents FIRE is a nonprofit watchdog organization based in Philadelphia that works on civil liberty issues such as free speech and due process on American college and university campuses PERIOD

Cohn spoke for a halfhour beginning at  p.m PERIOD inside PSUs Native American Community Center and engaged the audience of  students faculty and guests in questions and dialogue for about an additional hour afterward PERIOD The event was hosted by secular humanist groups Freethinkers of PSU and Center for Inquiry Portland PERIOD

Troubling trends
In his speech Cohn described what he sees as troubling trends in censorship on campuses nationwide and the potential dangers that could follow PERIOD

People have a hard time imagining that if censorship becomes normalized how it could be turned against them Cohn said PERIOD They perceive they arent the ones who are in trouble PERIOD Then it seems like a great idea but you arent always going to be the one who is in charge. censorship manifests according to Cohn in campaigns to have speakers disinvited from college campuses the refusal to allow unfavorable voices to be heard and the mistaken belief that we have a right to not be offended and that the right must be enforced on college campuses. the last few years have seen speakers like Condoleeza Rice Madeleine Albright exMuslim human rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali IMF head Christine Lagarde and comedian Bill Maher among others all subject to these campaigns with mixed degrees of success PERIOD

PSU philosophy professor Peter Boghossian introduced Cohns discussion with a statement regarding the zeitgeist of critical thought in society at large PERIOD

People are brandishing free speech issues as some kind of far right neoconservative concept which is just factually incorrect Boghossian said PERIOD Its absolutely unequivocally untrue. cohn attributed the phenomenon to issues lamented in FIRE resident Greg Lukianoffs  Atlantic article The coddling of the American mind coauthored by NYU professor Jonathan Haidt PERIOD

Lukianoffs article offers two assertions Cohn said PERIOD First there is a movement taking place for making colleges safe places where students are shielded from words or ideas that could make some of them uncomfortable PERIOD The second is that this movement poses a real and significant danger to the scholarship and quality of education obtained at American universities. cohn cited incidents of protest demanding trigger warnings before assigned readings of F PERIOD Scott Fitzgeralds The Great Gatsby and Chinua Achebes Things Fall Apart PERIOD He spoke of seemingly innocuous computer usage policies and schools requiring applicants to surrender access to their social media accounts PERIOD

Playing the game of selfcensorship
Khalid Alshaikh an attendee who earned his B.A PERIOD in political science from PSU in  agreed with Cohns views on the challenges of censorship in higher education PERIOD

Its funny because university is supposed to be a melting pot of views Alshaikh said PERIOD I censored myself in class because I learned early on that if you write something the professor disagrees with you get a bad grade PERIOD So you go along you play the game. pSU student Blake Horner asked How should students defend themselves from censorship by faculty in the classroom

In his response Cohn cited an incident at a university this year in which a student blew the whistle on a professors long offtopic political rant when the subject was not germain to the course PERIOD Cohn also explained such issues have to be handled on a case by case basis PERIOD For example in the humanities a wide range of interpretations make the course insightful PERIOD On the other hand when politics arent related to course material students shouldnt be graded differently because of their opinions PERIOD

Cohn closed with an appeal to student action PERIOD

Now is a really important time to engage your administration critically about censorship and talk about ways that they can earn a green light from us FIRE Cohn said PERIOD FIRE is always available to work with the universities and we need students to stand up and say thats the kind of university they want to go to. pSU is presently not rated in the FIRE database of college rankings PERIOD
