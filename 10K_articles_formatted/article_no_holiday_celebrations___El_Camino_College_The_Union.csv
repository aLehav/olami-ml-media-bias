	The holiday season is coming up PERIOD
	Although there are many people in the world who join their friends and family to celebrate the holidays there are still plenty of people who choose to not join in on the celebrations when those days arrive PERIOD
	The followers of a particular religion known as Jehovahs Witnesses are one of the groups of people who dont believe in the celebration of holidays PERIOD
	All holidays including birthdays are considered pagan holidays and may not be observed by Witnesses the ReligionFacts Web site said PERIOD
	According to the Jehovahs Witnesses official Web site they believe that Jesus never commanded Christians to celebrate the day of his birth Christmas but instead instructed his followers to only memorialize or remember his death PERIOD
	In addition to that the official Jehovahs Witnesses Web site said that Christmas as well as Easter both came from ancient false religions. the early Christians did not celebrate Christmas or Easter nor do true Christians today the Web site said PERIOD
	Instead of gathering around a Christmas tree to exchange gifts the Religion News Blog Web site said that Jehovahs Witnesses go to an annual memorial service in order to commemorate the death of Jesus PERIOD
	Even though Jehovahs Witnesses are widely known not to celebrate holidays even when its are around the corner they are not the only ones PERIOD
	My family has never really done anything when holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas come PERIOD Weve never bought a Christmas tree or threw a big family party like a lot of other people John Kim art major said PERIOD
	Kim whose family is Buddhist said that his parents and his sister just gather together for a homecooked meal by his mother PERIOD Afterwards they just stay at home and watch TV like they do on a regular night PERIOD
	Ive never found it weird or wished it was different Kim said PERIOD Im used to it because thats how I grew up PERIOD My parents would just give me and my sister money and that was that PERIOD No giftwrapped presents or anything he said PERIOD
	Unlike Jehovahs Witnesses Kim said that he and his family do not feel that holidays and birthdays are pagan holidays. instead the reason his family does not make a big deal out of holiday celebrations because they believe holidays are just like any other days except with specific names PERIOD
	I understand why others out there celebrate Christmas Easter and Thanksgiving and such but that doesnt mean me and my family should change our ways to be like everyone else PERIOD Thats just how we are and I dont think its going to change any time soon he said PERIOD
