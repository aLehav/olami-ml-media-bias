Dear Bucknellians

To those of us who are long time fans of Bucknell basketball the absence of a rowdy student body in Sojka Pavilion is perplexing PERIOD

In case you havent noticed both your womens and mens teams are leading the Patriot League each with only one loss and streaking towards  plus wins thisseasonand possible post season berths PERIOD

This success is not an aberration PERIOD The mens team has been one of the most dominant programs in the Patriot League for years and the women have been on an incredible trajectory as well recently PERIOD

The absence of the student body is conspicuous PERIOD The most loyal fan support comes from the surrounding community but a raucous atmosphere that is intimidating to visiting teams has to come from fellow students who take a two hour break to go and have some fun PERIOD

With only a few games left there is time to make a difference in your college experience PERIOD Come out and have some fun and get loud and rowdy PERIOD You will remember it well beyond your college years I promise PERIOD
