The NYU mens baseball team took on the City College of New York in a doubleheader at home in Brooklyn this weekend PERIOD NYU came out on top in both of the weekends outings PERIOD

Fridays game was a lowscoring affair but NYU was able to pull out a  win PERIOD Runs came few and far between with the Violets getting on the board first in the second inning on a single from sophomore infielder Andrew Cilento that scored sophomore infielder Jonathan Iaione PERIOD The Violets second run was on another single in the fifth inning this time from freshman second baseman Ryan McLaughlin with freshman center fielder Jack Walter easily crossing the plate PERIOD

Saturdays game offered a much different flavor with NYU delivering a  shellacking to CCNY on senior day PERIOD The teams three departing seniors catcher CJ Picerni left fielder Adrian Spitz and pitcher Jacob Bader were celebrated pregame PERIOD

CCNY stalled after scoring two in the first inning going cold for the remainder of the game PERIOD NYU came out hot in the third after a scoreless second tallying four runs PERIOD After getting hit by a pitch McLaughlin along with Walter made it home on an error to tie things at two PERIOD The goahead runs came from freshman first baseman Colman Hendershot and Spitz thanks to a tworun single from sophomore shortstop Jake Smith PERIOD

NYU pulled further ahead in the fifth inning with their fifth run coming via an RBI single from Hendershot PERIOD Hendershot then went on to score on a passed ball to earn the Violets their sixth run and Smith played copycat stealing third and coming all the way home due to yet another throwing error PERIOD

McLaughlin sent Iaione home in the sixth inning on a fielding error PERIOD The final two runs came in the seventh first sophomore Michael Vokulich scored on CCNYs fifth error of the game the second came from freshman infielder Jack Elias hitting a groundout and scoring sophomore catcher Scott Hilbrandt PERIOD
