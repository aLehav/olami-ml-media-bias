2645,2023-11-04,"with less than ten seconds left against Vanguard on Saturday evening the UC Irvine mens basketball teams sophomore Will Davis II came up with the rebound off of an opponents long threepoint attempt PERIOD Davis dished the ball up the court to point guard Derick Flowers who passed it to Chris McNealy between the halfcourt and threepoint lines with no defender in sight PERIOD As McNealy hesitated with a  lead he heard Coach Russell Turner sitting a few feet behind him along the baseline PERIOD

Score it Turner said according to McNealy PERIOD

The junior guard took two dribbles launched off of two feet and threw down a twohanded slam to eclipse the century mark PERIOD McNealy finished with  points four rebounds and two assists PERIOD One second remained on the clock as the Anteaters went on to defeat Vanguard  in their only preseason exhibition PERIOD

In a game that shouldnt have been as close as it was McNealys dunk was symbolic PERIOD No PERIOD  threw the twohanded jam down with emphasis as if to say Were not going to come up short this season. coach Turner jokingly said after the game that he didnt know McNealy could dunk guaranteeing that it was the first time in McNealys college career that he had dunked twice in a game PERIOD McNealy later confirmed that it was his first dunk as an Anteater PERIOD

Weve got a lot of players who can score said McNealy who came off the bench Saturday night after starting all  games and averaging . points per game last season PERIOD We rotate PERIOD Weve got  players who can score so were going to see a lot of highlights this year. the last time the Anteaters scored  points in a game was January   in a  loss to UC Davis PERIOD

Across the board UCI spread the wealth and looked like a deep team with a number of weapons  particularly in the paint PERIOD The five bigs  Adam Folker  John Ryan  Mike Best  Conor Clifford  and Davis   accounted for  points and  rebounds PERIOD

UCI basketball has come a long way in terms of the big men PERIOD Consider this Two years ago with thenpower forward Eric Wise bothered by lower back injuries the Anteaters played with Pavol Losonsky a sixfooteleven forward who preferred midrange jumpers to grinding in the paint and Mike Wilder a sixfoottwoinch tall guard as the teams center and power forward PERIOD

I think were definitely on the rise sophomore forward Mike Best said punfully PERIOD Having this kind of size will help us against Big West teams and against programs like UCLA USC and Nevada. irvine pulled down  rebounds on Saturday evening  more than the teams season average from a year ago PERIOD They also had  free throw attempts  higher than last years average charity stripe total of  per game PERIOD

Offensive rebounds man thats what I live by sophomore John Ryan said after scoring  points and snagging nine rebounds four of which were off the offensive glass PERIOD

Of the  active Anteaters eight nabbed at least four rebounds and five scored in doubledigits PERIOD Senior guards Daman Starring and Wilder the two leading scorers from last season scored seven and six points respectively  a great sign for a balanced Anteater team that didnt need their leaders to bail them out PERIOD But with great scoring came great defensive letdowns late in the second half PERIOD UCI was outscored  in the final  minutes after leading  at halftime PERIOD

I was surprised that we let them back into the game Turner saidbecause we had control of the game and I thought that we didnt maintain that control PERIOD So that was a disappointing thing PERIOD Weve got to figure that out because its not going to be easy . the two biggest losers on the Anteaters are freshman center Conor Clifford and Ryan PERIOD Clifford has now lost  pounds since arriving this summer for his rookie college season while Ryan lost  pounds over the past year since transferring from Fresno State University PERIOD

Ive been waiting for this moment for way too long Ryan said of his first game in an Anteater uniform PERIOD

The 7foot Clifford made his first college basket a memorable one five minutes into the first half PERIOD Davis dished to the center in the low post who had an open look at the rim PERIOD Clifford punished the rim with a onehanded slam for his first of five field goals on the evening PERIOD

Conor might have the best hands in the league Ryan said of Clifford whom he razzes often in practice but clearly admires as a teammate PERIOD He can catch anything we throw to him PERIOD Its real fun to play with these guys. the freshman was  from the field and  at the free throw line finishing with  points and five rebounds in his 11minute debut PERIOD Clifford will continue to be Coach Turners big engine that could PERIOD

I always jam on the gas pedal and blow through all my gas Clifford said of his energy level shortly after walking out of the locker room to wave to his fellow freshman residents who remained in the stadium half an hour after the final buzzer coming across campus from Middle Earth to see the big fella play PERIOD

Im playing against Adam Folker John Ryan and Mike Best in practice and theyre the best competition for me Clifford said PERIOD They know I like to go to the right sky hook so I have to come up with new moves against them PERIOD Best has been teaching me some new moves. at point guard Derick Flowers typically goes by the nickname Agent Zero for his jersey number but after taking an elbow to the mouth in the first half DFlo headed to the locker room to swap out his jersey which was stained red PERIOD Flowers emerged in the second half with the number  on his back PERIOD So Agent Twelve from now on DFlo

No were back to Agent Zero next game Flowers said laughing with a box of Dominos in his hands after scoring  points and making all three of his attempts from beyond the arc PERIOD

Backing up Flowers off the bench was Alex Young whose skill set looks eerily similar to former Anteater Darren Moore PERIOD At sixfeettall Young is a tank securing four offensive rebounds at the point dishing out six assists and scoring nine points in his college debut PERIOD Young slashes to the basket like Moore used to and has exceptional touch around the rim PERIOD The freshman played a teamhigh  minutes and looks beyond his years in terms of maturity and decisionmaking on the court PERIOD

Folkers offensive game looks better than ever but its still befuddling that the Bren Events Center doesnt play the Canadian national anthem pregame for the center from Markham Ontario PERIOD

In  minutes Folker scored  points nailing all four of his freethrow attempts PERIOD Last season Folker made just  percent of his free throws PERIOD Coach Turner preached relaxation at the end of last Thursdays practice encouraging players to think of someone or something they love to calm down and slow down before shooting PERIOD Thirty minutes following the pep talk Folkers teammates had left the gym but he was still on the court practicing his free throws long after his teammates departure PERIOD

In years past the Im getting mine selfish mentality has clouded the Anteaters team goals PERIOD Players often were too concerned with how a 20point performance could improve the chances of an NBA Developmental League or European League contract PERIOD

This years Anteaters are different mainly because Starring Wilder Folker Flowers and McNealy are working their asses off for each other and playing selflessly PERIOD They share the ball they share minutes they hit open teammates and so far theyre winners PERIOD
