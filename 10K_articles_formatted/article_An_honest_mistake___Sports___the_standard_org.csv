The scoring error occurred during the mens 200yard freestyle race PERIOD

Missouri State had four topfive finishers in the race PERIOD Bears swimmer Kevin Douglas finished fifth and was given a point PERIOD NCAA rules only allow for a maximum of three swimmers who can score in a single race Douglas should have not been awarded a point PERIOD

So with Douglas point being canceled Drury swimmer David Wong who finished sixth was then awarded one point giving the Panthers the victory PERIOD
