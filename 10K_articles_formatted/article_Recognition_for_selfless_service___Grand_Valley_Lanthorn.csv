Making significant contributions to community resources is a deed that is not left unrewarded PERIOD Kanyn Doan a junior studying Women Gender  Sexuality Studies at Grand Valley State University received the Outstanding Community Impact Award  which is an honor given to a student who has made service an integral part of their college experience PERIOD

The award was given through Michigan Campus Compact MiCC a coalition of college and university presidents who are committed to fulfilling the public purpose of higher education PERIOD MiCC promotes the education and commitment of Michigan college students to be civically engaged citizens through creating and expanding academic cocurricular and campuswide opportunities for community service service learning and civic engagement PERIOD

Doan was nominated for the award through Brittany Dernberger assistant director of the Womens Center PERIOD  Dernberger said that she nominated Doan because of her strong commitment to gender justice and service learning PERIOD

Doan has been actively involved in the Womens Center as a Womens Leadership House resident PERIOD She has also been a Womens Center ambassador and a participant on the Womens Center and Women Gender  Sexuality Studies South Africa study abroad trip PERIOD Dernberger said that in these roles Doan has participated in leading multiple days of service presenting at the Leadership Summit on behalf of the Womens Center and regularly represents the Womens Center at events around campus PERIOD

Kanyn regularly takes on additional challenges and responsibilities for the Womens Center Dernberger said PERIOD This past January she served on a social justice service learning panel PERIOD This award is a great honor because it is a statewide recognition of her dedication and hard work. while on the panel for social justice learning Doan received the initial Community Impact Award PERIOD Once selected she was required to write about her service and the impact it has had for her and others and was then awarded the Outstanding Service Award PERIOD

While writing about her service her volunteer work in South Africa first came to mind PERIOD Not only did she provide service for the residents but they provided unexpected services for her PERIOD

We go in thinking that we need to alter them but really we should be learning from them Doan said PERIOD It changed my life PERIOD It really did PERIOD It was a really lifealtering experience. focusing on everyday tasks is a crucial part of service for Doan where recognition is not considered a primary goal when participating in service PERIOD

We need to start asking questions asking whyand really trying to dig deeper  and not just checking off the hours and checking off the box Doan said PERIOD How can we impact our campus How can we teach each other

Doan hopes to take the experiences she has had and use it as a teaching tool to reach out to other students PERIOD  She said she hopes to keep learning and that the knowledge and kindness she passes on will be carried out in other communities and help shape them and allow them to shape her PERIOD

The world wasnt designed the way it was just for us to learn about its for us to experience Doan said PERIOD Im going to meet as many people as I can and Im going to let every opportunity take me away with itI have a pretty broad major and a pretty broad mindset. emailprotected
