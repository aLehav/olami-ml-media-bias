2628,2023-11-04,"every year the holidays herald the release of emotionallytaxing movies and this year is no exception PERIOD Although The Kite Runner has not yet been released to the public a group of about  students who signed up through the Anteater Book Club watched the prescreening last Tuesday Nov  PERIOD
The bestselling fiction novel by Khaled Hosseini was successfully transformed into an equally enthralling film PERIOD Through the experiences of Amir Hosseinis narrator the movie depicts the situation in Afghanistan from  until the takeover by the Taliban PERIOD
While the movie retains the universal themes of familial relationships guilt and loyalty the setting in Kabul Afghanistan makes for a shocking representation of a world that most audiences have never witnessed before PERIOD Although the movie is sprinkled with humor and warmth it is an intense depiction of a tragic story PERIOD
The movies Middle Eastern soundtrack sets the mood as audiences are introduced to an adult Amir living in San Francisco but then dropped back in time to witness his experiences growing up in an upper class family in Kabul PERIOD
The story revolves around 12yearold Amirs relationship with Hassan the son of his fathers servant who is the best kite runner in town PERIOD
Symbolic of Amir and Hassans innocence the kite battles that consume the young boys time are shortlived as reality interrupts PERIOD Amirs character is built around a heartwrenching scene where he silently witnesses Hassan being brutalized by older boys of the dominant Pashtun class the same day that Amir is victorious in the town kite wars PERIOD The incident destroys Amir and Hassans relationship as Amir isolates himself and spends the rest of his life consumed with guilt PERIOD
After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan Amir and his father whose open affection he longs for are able to escape to Pakistan and then move to San Francisco PERIOD The onceprivileged father and son spend their lives working at a gas station and selling odds and ends at the weekend swamp meets where they interact with other formerly honorable Afghans PERIOD Busy with his storytelling Amir suppresses his haunting memories from Kabul and settles into his life in San Francisco as a writer PERIOD
However after the death of his father and a call from his fathers ailing best friend Rahim Khan Amir is compelled to return to his homeland and face his past PERIOD From this point forward nothing but the harsh reality of life in wartorn Afghanistan is revealed PERIOD
Amir is dealt with quite a few blows as he discovers just how deep his relationship with Hassan was and he sets out on a journey to rescue and adopt Hassans son who is stuck in an orphanage PERIOD
An old man selling his wooden leg for money to buy his children food the wretched orphanage and the scene of a young boy being forced into prostitution all bring to bare the devastation of the oncelively streets filled with children flying their colorful kites PERIOD
Although Amirs survival of his adventure into the heart of corruption where he encounters the same man who abused Hassan as a child seemed rather melodramatic it was overshadowed by the honest emotions portrayed in the actors faces as Amir and Sohrab Hassans son were greeted at the airport in San Francisco by Soraya Amirs wife PERIOD
The casting and the acting are both brilliant PERIOD Both the professional and nonprofessional actors give stunning performances that add to the vivid portrayal and keep the audience engaged in spite of the majority of the movie being in Farsi PERIOD However what ultimately makes the movie is that it focuses primarily on universallyappealing human emotions rather than just dwelling on the politics of a distant world that most audiences cannot comprehend PERIOD
The movie is set to release on Dec PERIOD  PERIOD
