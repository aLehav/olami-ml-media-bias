Tonight is my last night serving as the EditorinChief EIC of the UP PERIOD

I came to FAU from Clarksville Tenn PERIOD As a queer person I saw Florida as a chance to be myself and the first two years I did just that PERIOD When I became a student leader I noticed an entirely different side of FAU PERIOD

As Gov PERIOD Ron DeSantis and the Florida Legislature continue their attacks on people of color and the LGBTQ community FAU officials have stayed silent PERIOD They have simply handed over information instead of protecting their students and employees PERIOD As a queer student leader I am outraged PERIOD

FAU failed us PERIOD Students held a number of protests throughout campus where to my knowledge not one upper admin was present PERIOD A protest outside of the admin building was completely ignored by those working inside PERIOD

I think that a school who prides itself on being the most diverse university in Florida would at least denounce the efforts or provide more resources for their students PERIOD How does FAU expect its students to trust in the system when administrators dont even stand up for us

This isnt the only major thing happening with FAU affecting our communities PERIOD

A presidential search where DeSantis has recommended Rep PERIOD Randy Fine for the presidency is taking place. if FAU cant even stand against DeSantis broad attacks theyre definitely not going against his wishes to have a politician as president PERIOD

In fact the presidential search committee representatives told student leaders that politics will affect the search and no one batted an eye PERIOD

The UP is one of the only student organizations that fights for transparency yet the FAU media relations team leaves most of our emails unanswered.Coincidentally the media relations team denied a public records request for finalized Title IX reports citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act despite already providing us an invoice for over  PERIOD They did this less than  hours before my graduation PERIOD

They did the same thing when former EIC Kendall Little graduated and I took over PERIOD They like to wait us out and think that if they hide behind the end of the semester the next EIC wont fight them PERIOD

Well I have news for them the next EIC is ready to fight for students like I have PERIOD

I have challenged the university multiple times over the past two semesters and the writers and editors have seen that fight and most share my anger and disappointment PERIOD FAU may not care about following the law but the UP does PERIOD

If theres one thing Ive learned its to take hate and disagreements and stand by my morals and decisions while always fighting for what is right PERIOD

More importantly Ive learned how important it is to hold FAU accountable PERIOD

I hope hundreds more queer students and leaders will continue this fight PERIOD

Speak your mind even if your voice shakes inspired by the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg PERIOD
