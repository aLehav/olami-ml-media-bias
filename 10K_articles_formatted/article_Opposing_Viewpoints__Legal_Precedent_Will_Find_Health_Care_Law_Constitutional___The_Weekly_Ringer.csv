This past week in Florida a federal judge claimed that President Obamas health care plan was unconstitutional PERIOD Republican and Tea Party members vehemently oppose health care and doubt its constitutionality as well as the expanded role the federal government has taken PERIOD

The only industrialized nation to not ensure health care to every citizen is the United States PERIOD Whether the Affordable Care Act is the answer to health care in this country or not it is most certainly constitutional PERIOD

Former Ronald Reagan Solicitor General Charles Fried testified at a Senate hearing on The Constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. according to Fried the Act is absolutely constitutional under the Commerce Clause in Article One Section Eight of the Constitution PERIOD

The Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations as well as among states and Indian tribes PERIOD In the  case Gibbons v PERIOD Ogden Chief Justice John Marshall said that Congress commerce power means power to regulate or to proscribe rule by which commerce is governed. insurance was considered commerce in the  Supreme Court case United States v PERIOD SouthEastern Underwriters PERIOD Therefore Congress surely has the power to regulate health insurance PERIOD The individual mandate which forces every citizen to purchase health insurance is part of a law to regulate insurance which is commerce PERIOD

According to Forbes health care costs in this country constitutes nearly  percent of our gross domestic product further supporting the argument that insurance is commerce PERIOD

Fried continues his argument to the  case McCulloch v PERIOD Maryland which stated the powers given to the government imply the ordinary means of execution. the government has the power to act which allows for regulation PERIOD

In this case the question at hand was the creation of a federal bank PERIOD Although the Constitution does not confront the issue of a national bank directly Congress still had the power to create such a bank to facilitate national security and interstate commerce says Los Angeles Times writer Akhil Reed Amar PERIOD He writes Obamacare is no different. fried said the individual mandate is essential to the regulation of health insurance which is completely within the governments authority PERIOD

Amar points out that Obamacare does not mandate every citizen to purchase insurance but those who remain uninsured must pay a tax PERIOD The federal judge in Florida claims this is unconstitutional under Congress tax powers PERIOD However according to Amar this is untrue and reinforced by the  Income Tax Amendment PERIOD

The legal arguments over the bill disregard its ultimate purpose which is to fix health care in the United States PERIOD

The major problem is people believe any new role of government is a limitation to personal freedom PERIOD Health care needs to be viewed as a right to every citizen rather than an industry to be unregulated by federal authorities PERIOD",Opposing Viewpoints: Legal Precedent Will Find Health Care Law Constitutional â€“ The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
