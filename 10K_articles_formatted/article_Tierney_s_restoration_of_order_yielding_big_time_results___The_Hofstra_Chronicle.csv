To better understand Seth Tierneys journey through the college lacrosse world perhaps its best to borrow a line from The Grateful Dead

What a long strange trip it has been PERIOD

Really theres no other way to put it PERIOD The secondyear Hofstra mens lacrosse head coach has dedicated his entire life to a sport that is virtually unknown outside of the MidAtlantic region and he has enjoyed a large amount of success in the process PERIOD However the most remarkable thing is not Tierneys contribution to the sportthat much is undeniable PERIOD Rather its the way that he has arrived at this juncture as a head coach celebrating Hofstra lacrosses first ever win over a topranked opponent the way he was able to do after Saturdays  nailbiter over Tierneys alma mater Johns Hopkins PERIOD

You see if the Hofstra success story seems familiar to Tierney thats because it is PERIOD As an assistant coach at Hofstra between  and  Tierney was part of six consecutive winning seasons with a combined overall record of  a  mark in conference play PERIOD As a member of John Danowskis staff Tierney helped the Pride win five league titles receive five top  national rankings and play in four NCAA Tournaments all before his thirty-second birthday PERIOD

When a similar position opened up at Hopkins following the  season Tierney couldnt pass it up PERIOD He spent the six subsequent seasons in Baltimore directing the Blue Jays offense which became one of the most explosive units in the nation PERIOD After two years as associate head coach under current Hopkins leader Dave Pietramala Tierney found himself back on Long Island after Danowski left the program after  years to accept the head coach position at Duke PERIOD

And now here Tierney was more than  months after returning to Hempstead celebrating a win over his alma mater and former employer while coaching his current employer PERIOD Who just so happens to also be a former employer PERIOD

Still with us If not thats OK as long as you understand the intrigue of Tierneys trek PERIOD Throw in a win in the national championship game and you could have a movie script in the works PERIOD

 Tierney said after Saturdays victory PERIOD 

The softspoken Tierney possessed his normal calm demeanor after beating Hopkins not wanting the  to overshadow what his players accomplished out on the field PERIOD But it was hard not to be impressed by the circumstances a sentiment echoed by his former boss PERIOD

 Pietramala said in reference to Hofstras first win over a No PERIOD  opponent in five tries PERIOD 

On Pietramalas way out of the Margiotta Hall press room he and Tierney shared a warm embrace PERIOD It was one of mutual respect between one man that helped another get to this point and Pietramala was more than happy to let his former protg enjoy the moment PERIOD And make no mistake about it Pietramala misses Tierney on his staff PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

Tierney has taken that opportunity by the horns in his first two seasons PERIOD He has successfully taken a team that had an eyepopping seven onegoal losses in  and turned it into one that now clearly possesses the conviction that it is capable of beating any team in the country regardless of national rank PERIOD Come to think of it maybe the gap between the two teams wasnt as wide as fans may have thought PERIOD

On Saturday a reporter asked Tierney if this win carried more significance than any other considering the opponent and the coach thought for a moment before replying PERIOD

 he said PERIOD Im the mens lacrosse coach at Hofstra University. thankfully for Hofstra and its lacrosse program Tierneys long strange trip has finally found its rightful resting stop PERIOD
