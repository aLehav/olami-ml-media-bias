This Saturday Dec PERIOD  WMUA will host Record Fest at the Cape Cod Lounge in the Student Union from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD The festival is the first of its kind and marks the latest in a string of events organized by the nonprofit student and communityrun radio station PERIOD

 vendors from across New England and the East Coast will have tables with an array of vinyl CDs movies and other paraphernalia for sale PERIOD With such a wide sampling of sellers the selection of genres represented at the festival promises to be varied enough for any audiophiles tastes PERIOD

Originally conceived as a collaborative work with the Easthampton Flywheel an arts collective that has run similar events in the past Record Fest transformed over time into a solo venture for WMUA PERIOD

As time has passed the event has grown by leaps and bounds PERIOD The station filled all its allocated table space to prospective sellers well in advance PERIOD

The vendor response for the event has been amazing said WMUA Music Director Alex Hornbeck PERIOD We filled up weeks ago and have still been getting requests. the overwhelming response from vinyl retailers and labels was a pleasant surprise for the station PERIOD

We werent exactly sure just how big this would be said WMUA General Manager David Murray PERIOD After we posted a listing for the event a month ago weve been getting a few emails and calls every day its been great. in addition to the record sale the station has booked a range of independent acts to provide live music for Record Fest PERIOD WMUA DJs will play sets in between bands to complete the sonic backdrop for the event PERIOD

One featured performer will be local electronic artist Eric Hnatow PERIOD Hnatow will perform his distinctive blend of electronic music for festivalgoers PERIOD This is Hnatows second appearance at a WMUAhosted event this year having played at the stations free concert in September PERIOD

Traveling all the way from Baltimore Md. will be Teeth Mountain PERIOD

Teeth Mountain played this past summer in Northampton and we were really impressed by them Hornbeck said of the band PERIOD We talked with them about coming up in the future to play a WMUA event PERIOD Were really happy to have them playing. rabbit Rabbit and Brown Recluse Sings will round out the festivals performers PERIOD The two bands will provide a change of pace with a mixture of postpunk and psychedelic pop to compliment the events diverse selection of music PERIOD

With no precedent set the station is still unsure what to expect in terms of a turnout PERIOD However if student interest can come close to matching the interest displayed by area vendors the station plans to make Record Fest a regularly occurring event PERIOD

Were going to wait and see how it goes hopefully if its a success well try and organize another festival during the spring semester Hornbeck said PERIOD

In addition to hosting and organizing the event WMUA will also sell a variety of CDs and vinyl from its own vendor table PERIOD

WMUAs Record Fest will run Saturday from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD at the Cape Cod Lounge in the Student Union Center PERIOD Admittance is free PERIOD
