I remember when the movie  first came out in the mid1990s and all the teenagers had cell phones PERIOD I thought wow they are so rich they all have cell phones PERIOD I never would have thought that in a few short years that everyone would own their own cell phone and I never thought that cell phones would be used at some of the most inappropriate times like they are today PERIOD The moment someone hears the ring of their cell they stop everything and rush to answer it as if their life depends on this one phone call PERIOD When people are driving in their car or out to dinner with someone checking out in line at a store or maybe in some rare cases in class you will see people ignoring what they should be paying attention to just to talk on their cell PERIOD



When I see someone driving down the road talking on their phone I cant help but wonder if they are really paying attention to their driving or to their super important chat on their phone PERIOD Now of course a quick call is okay and pretty harmless its just the people who are on their cell for more than a few seconds who could possibly cause harm PERIOD When you are on your phone in the car you are distracted with your conversation and pay much less attention to the other cars around you PERIOD Hopefully people will begin to realize how inconsiderate it is to other drivers when you are not paying attention to the road PERIOD



Another rude aspect of cell phones is when people answer them when you are having dinner with them PERIOD Dinner phone conversations should never happen PERIOD When you are out to eat with someone whether it be your friend boyfriend or girlfriend or your parents you should not be on your phone talking PERIOD If you choose to do that I hope you realize how rude it is because when you are out to dinner with someone you are there to enjoy their company and not chat on your phone during the meal PERIOD



Another huge problem with cell phone use would have to be when you are checking out in line whether it be at the grocery store or at the mall you should end your conversation before the cashier starts checking out your order PERIOD I can speak from personal experience on this because I have worked at a grocery store before PERIOD When people would come through my line talking on their cell it was so rude when I ask them how they are doing they did not respond all they do is swipe their credit card when it is time to pay then continue their



conversation PERIOD That is one of the worst ways you can be rude on your cell phone PERIOD To ignore someone who is doing a service for you is rude and inconsiderate PERIOD I know sometimes a call can be urgent but for the most part everyone is having random conversations that can wait until later PERIOD



I once saw a girl talking on her cell during my Geology class PERIOD Now of course this was a rather larger class with over a  students in there so the instructor was not aware of this PERIOD However it was still rude because it was a distraction to other students sitting around her when she was chatting on her phone while the rest of us were trying to absorb information on seismic waves PERIOD Not to mention it was not a smart move for her because she was in class and should have been paying more attention PERIOD



Cell phones are a huge convenience I will admit to that PERIOD I remember when I was  I got my first cell because it was something my parents wanted me to have in case of an emergency PERIOD Im sure many other people have cells for the same reason PERIOD Of course my phone gets a lot more use then for emergency only situations PERIOD I even just recently went over my monthly maximum free minutes PERIOD However I never use my phone when it is not an appropriate time because I feel that cell phone conversations should not be inconsiderate to other people around you PERIOD
