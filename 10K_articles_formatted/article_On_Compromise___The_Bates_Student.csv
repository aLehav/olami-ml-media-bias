7612,2023-11-05,"with Congresss approval rating hovering just around  percent I think it is safe to say that what many people would like to see in the new session of Congress is compromise PERIOD However compromise is often problematic and as Paul Krugman said in a recent New York Times article implying a symmetry between Republicans and Democrats isnt just misleading its actively harmful. and this is something we need to recognize PERIOD In any effort to compromise on anything there has to be some semblance of equality among the sides PERIOD However it is often the case that one side is actively fighting to subvert the other for little more than perceived political gain PERIOD

But compromise shouldnt be a dirty word nor should we just say that one party is right over the otherno matter how my articles may make it sound PERIOD After all unilateral action can have unintended and deleterious consequences PERIOD

Lets take a look at current events though PERIOD The recent and socalled fiscal cliff fiasco illustrates just what I am talking about PERIOD In this case the crisis was manufactured in the sense that the effort for compromise was essentially a steeplechase PERIOD Each time some ground was gained the bar would be moved by Republicans in the House of Representatives PERIOD I was a big advocate for going over the cliff. after all the effects most likely wouldnt have been immediate and the overwhelming majority of Americans would have blamed the GOP for the failure to accomplish something PERIOD The backlash would have been swift and the judgment harsh PERIOD Something would have been easily done PERIOD

This is where Krugmans statement about both sides having equal footing becomes important PERIOD It was clear throughout the entire drawnout process that Republicans wanted nothing more than to punish the President for winning the recent election PERIOD This is politics at its most reckless PERIOD Legislating for nothing more than spite does no good for anyone PERIOD

So whats the solution First we need to recognize that in this case not every side is working for what is best for the American people PERIOD Am I saying that the GOP has some ulterior bigbusiness motive No PERIOD Im not a conspiracy theorist but I do believe that a hefty portion of the proposals that they make have not been shown to be overall beneficial PERIOD After we recognize this simple fact then action becomes possible and we can shun the offer counteroffer strategy which failed us in December PERIOD

On the other side of things the recent shooting in Connecticut shows the necessity for compromise PERIOD The NRA crawled out of its hideyhole mere days after the tragedy to have Wayne LaPierre make the bold suggestion that The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. i guess its no matter that many Latin and South American countries do in fact have many more good guys with guns and do not have an appreciably lower violent crime rate to show for it according to the New York Times PERIOD

But snarkiness aside the NRA has been tearing down barriers for gun owners for years now PERIOD For many this is quite positive but another large portion of the public would argue and I would tend to agree that the proliferation of guns in our country is one of the biggest public health issues that we face today PERIOD

This is where compromise comes into play PERIOD There is a middle ground here and as much as I hate to say it each side has a valid argument PERIOD We can have our cake and eat it too in this case PERIOD Do we need assault weapons Do we need highcapacity magazines Do we need the capability to fire almost  bullets in mere minutes killing  adults and children with brutal efficiency No unequivocally we do not PERIOD

Compromise has become a dirty word in recent years and its no surprise why there hasnt been any PERIOD There is a time for compromise and a time for unilateral action but knowing when it is time for one and not the other is the big trick PERIOD I advocate for smarter politics PERIOD I advocate for conversation and intelligent discourse not politics for politics sake PERIOD We deserve better and we can do better PERIOD
