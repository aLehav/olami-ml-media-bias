Apple pie PERIOD Stars and stripes PERIOD Chinesemade uniforms

One of these things is not like the other PERIOD Last Friday news broke that the uniforms for Team USA were manufactured in China and not in America PERIOD The prices for the clothing were outrageous a whopping . for one outfit PERIOD Not even a stylish teenager could justify that cost PERIOD

Worse yet the Ralph Lauren logo was the same size or larger than the USA logo. its hard not to see this as having more pride in ones clothing label than in ones county PERIOD

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said 

Readers Reid isnt wrong PERIOD Why Ralph Lauren thought it would be a good idea to manufacture these uniforms in a foreign country is difficult to say but it was a huge oversight on the designers part PERIOD

The Olympics first and foremost are about celebrating ones nationality PERIOD It isnt about giving away American textile workers jobs PERIOD It isnt about saving a few dollars by making the uniforms overseas PERIOD At the end of the day this is about pride in ones nation and taking care of our own PERIOD

Instead this decision is saying hurrah for outsourcing hurrah for giving away American jobs PERIOD

Such a message isnt appropriate during the Olympics and is especially gauche during a time of recession PERIOD Americans arent too good to make their own Olympic uniforms PERIOD

The Olympics is a time to celebrate all Americans and our specialness and our melting pot heritage PERIOD Such a blunder is embarrassing and annoying PERIOD Surely we have enough pride in ourselves and our nation to make our own uniforms PERIOD
