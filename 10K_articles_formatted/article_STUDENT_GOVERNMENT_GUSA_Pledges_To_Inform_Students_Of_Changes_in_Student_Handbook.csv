GUSA unanimously pledged to inform students of changes to the Student Handbook in a resolution passed Tuesday but postponed discussion on implementation of the changes to a later date PERIOD
At GUSAs weekly meeting Senior Class Representative Ben Anderson COL  described the Student Handbook resolution as a request that students be informed of the Student Handbook policy changes each academic year. though students were given a handbook detailing what they can and cannot do GUSA representatives said they wanted to make the university policies clearer and more accessible to students many of whom do not read the policies according to GUSA PERIOD
During the debate some representatives suggested that students be required to sign a form acknowledging receipt of the policy changes before registering for classes PERIOD
Among the problems the committee discussed was the timeliness of delivering the Student Handbooks PERIOD There were complaints that some students received their handbooks as late as two weeks into the academic year PERIOD Representatives suggested getting the books out to the Georgetown community earlier possibly a week before the start of classes PERIOD

GUSA also considered inserting a page outlining the changes in the front of each new handbook as another method of drawing students attention to policy changes but some on the committee felt it would not be cost effective to spend money to place an extra page in a book that likely wasnt being read by students PERIOD
