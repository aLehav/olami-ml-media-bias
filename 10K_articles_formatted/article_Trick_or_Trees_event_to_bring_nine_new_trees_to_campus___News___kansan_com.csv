KU Center for Sustainability and the KU Tree Advisory Board will host a tree planting event Friday as a part of their Replant Mount Oread project PERIOD

The event is called Trick or Trees and it is the first fall event for Replant Mount Oread PERIOD Students and volunteers will be planting nine new trees between Marvin and Lindley halls PERIOD The Center for Sustainability needs  to cover the cost of the trees and it is asking for donations online through KU Endowment PERIOD

Director of the Center for Sustainability Jeff Severin said more trees need to be planted because between  and  trees on campus are cut down each year due to storm damage disease or because the trees may be at the end of their natural lives PERIOD He said Trick or Trees is a good way to plant trees and involve students in the process PERIOD

Students will have an opportunity to come out pick up a shovel and actually do the planting themselves Severin said PERIOD

Victor Zaharopoulos a student representative on the KU Tree Advisory Board said he will be at Trick or Trees on Friday along with about  other volunteers PERIOD He said when there are a lot of volunteers at events like Trick or Trees people get energized about planting trees on campus PERIOD

If we can drum up that energy for these types of things we can keep this going for years down the road Zaharopoulos said PERIOD Im a senior PERIOD Im going to be leaving KU soon but Im hoping these types of things can continue to go on. severin said there is a need for extra funding for trees on campus because the University budget only allows for the planting of about  trees a year PERIOD He said the Center for Sustainability raises donations to cover the cost of projects like Trick or Trees so it will have funds if something unexpected happens like having to remove a tree from campus PERIOD

The goal is really to raise enough money with each project to cover the cost of that effort so that we can use those additional funds to address some of the other needs throughout the year Severin said PERIOD

Zaharopoulos said the cost of planting trees is worth it because of the oxygen they provide and the beauty they give to campus PERIOD

Trees are one of the few investments that actually appreciate in value over time Zaharopoulos said PERIOD It costs a lot to put these trees in its several thousand dollars but over time they grow larger they start giving back more. edited by Alyssa Scott
