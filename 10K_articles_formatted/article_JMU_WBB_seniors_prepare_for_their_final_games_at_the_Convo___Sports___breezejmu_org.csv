Senior guard Aneah Young has racked up  points during her career as a Duke PERIOD

Senior day can range from being a great moment to a sad one for a given player PERIOD This week JMU womens basketball is going to have that annual experience as senior guards Logan Reynolds and Aneah Young prepare to step onto the floor of the Convocation Center one last time PERIOD

Since the  season Reynolds and Young have developed into key players for the Dukes PERIOD For the most part their main focus is being strong defensive players for head coach Sean ORegan PERIOD

They definitely have an unselfishness in common ORegan said PERIOD Theyre the last crew that has been coached by Kenny Brooks and myself so they have been through a lot of different experiences. brooks was the coach that recruited the duo to the program but when he got an opportunity to become the head coach at Virginia Tech ORegan  who was a long time assistant coach under Brooks  was able to take the helm of the program PERIOD With a new leader in ORegan Reynolds and Young continued to grow into their roles PERIOD

Reynolds and Young have been dynamic players even though their point totals dont necessarily show it on a consistent basis PERIOD They can come up with a key play when you least expect it especially on the defensive side of the court PERIOD

Theyre not extremely vocal leaders  theyre selfless they give ORegan said PERIOD Theyre willing to take on any role that comes at them so they are very similar in that since PERIOD  they both have started and come off the bench at different points of their careers. reynolds career as a point guard has been a long journey PERIOD Being a backup to Angela Mickens when she first got to the school has shown the Norton Virginia native how to lead a team in PERIOD While Reynolds cant think of one distinct memory thats been her favorite over the years the combination of all has made the journey an outstanding one PERIOD

Hopefully my favorite memory will be coming up in the next two weeks Reynolds said PERIOD But I guess my favorite memory is just me becoming the player I am today and going through the trials and errors and failures becoming who I am because of my teammates coaches and because of the community here. senior guard Logan Reynolds has recorded  steals and  assists during her time at JMU PERIOD

Reynolds loved playing at the Convo during her career with the Dukes PERIOD Its infectious energy brings a certain vigor to her performance that cant be matched on the road PERIOD Statistically shes done more on the road but her season high of nine assists was in the confines of the Convo PERIOD

Im glad the new Convo hasnt necessarily been built yet this is such an authentic and unique experience from other college game days Ive been a part of Reynolds said PERIOD On top of that I dont think that the JMU community is anything short of perfection because its support of womens athletics more than any other sports community. young has the awareness of any situation on the court to be able to make defensive plays at the right time PERIOD This has made for some great memories for the program like drawing the charge at the end of regulation against Towson in February PERIOD However her defensive play isnt the only thing Young is known for PERIOD She also has a unique collection away from the game PERIOD

I kind of stole one of my sisters hats the first time I saw it Young said PERIOD I really liked it and liked how the accessory brought my outfit to life PERIOD So I became obsessed with hats and once I got my second hat I knew that this was it for me and I started collecting them. the team has taken notice of Youngs hat collection over the years PERIOD Youngs style is something her teammates have taken notice of and have started to participate in helping with it too PERIOD

Ive given her a couple of hats for her hat collection Reynolds said PERIOD I think shes stylish and shes on trend with everything so she has to evolve her hats too with whatever is going on at the time. one of the main things Reynolds and Young have done for the Dukes is share their knowledge with their teammates PERIOD As a younger teammate junior guard Kamiah Smalls looked to them for guidance on what it means to represent the JMU program as a student athlete on and off the court over the last three years PERIOD

Aneah is everything you can ask for in a teammate Smalls said PERIOD Shes the motivational one shes always positive she always has the good comments to give. as for Reynolds Smalls looks to her for the ways to excel on the basketball court  the habits that need to be made on and off the court to be the best player that she can be out there PERIOD

To me the biggest thing that lives on from Logan is her intensity and her passion for the game Smalls said PERIOD Logan goes out there on the court and gives a  percent no matter what condition her body is in where her mindset is no matter what she has going on outside of us she literally goes out here every day and gives her it all. contact Brandon Ellis ellis3bmdukes.jmu.edu For more basketball coverage follow the sports desk on Twitter TheBreezeSports PERIOD
