Robinson said the purpose of the photo shoot gave people the opportunity to display why feminism is important to them PERIOD

Eli Farmer a firsttime Womens Center volunteer said he plans on volunteering with other events in the future PERIOD

As a male I can use my male privilege to benefit the womens movement Farmer said PERIOD At the base level all feminism is women wanting the same rights as men  whats wrong with that

Farmer said the stigma surrounding feminism that it is antimen is not true PERIOD

I think people get hung up on that but if people sit down and do maybe three seconds of research theyll realize thats not the case Farmer said PERIOD

Robinson said Feminist Pride Day is an important day to the Womens Center PERIOD

It helps to get our message out people will understand that were here to help everybody and were here for benefitting everybody Robinson said PERIOD Were here to help students who may not have the funds to come to school. story Nicole Caporaso News Reporter
