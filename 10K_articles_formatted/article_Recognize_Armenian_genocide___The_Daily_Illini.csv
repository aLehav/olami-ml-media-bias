The symbolic recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the House Foreign Relations Committee was long overdue PERIOD Like the Holocaust the Armenian Genocide  in which more than a million people were liquidated  is a welldocumented event by scholars of history PERIOD The Turkish state and its operatives vehemently deny and distort the events but if we counted on governments to provide us the truth we wouldnt need history departments in academic institutions PERIOD

The schizophrenic reaction of the Turkish status quo is an example of how much the truth hurts PERIOD The atrocities against the Armenians were perpetrated by Ottoman Turks before the establishment of the Turkish Republic in  PERIOD

Just like we dont blame todays Germany for what the Nazis did against the Jews and other people in the tragic period of World War II we will not blame modern day Turkey for the events of  PERIOD The key difference is that Germans admit to the Holocaust while Turks turn their heads away from the overwhelming historical facts that substantiate the tragic events PERIOD

In a spring visit to our campus Turkish scholar Taner Akam  who has studied the events extensively  argued that Turkey needs to recognize the Armenian Genocide in order to prevent similar events from happening again PERIOD Until then it is crucial that the rest of the world recognizes it PERIOD I hope that our congressmen will pass the symbolic measure when it reaches the floor of the House PERIOD
