This election season will finally end on Tuesday PERIOD All of the hype all of the promises and all of the inane conversation about Joe the plumber and Main Street will quietly go away or so we hope. of course after the election is over the youknowwhat will really hit the fan PERIOD

Sen PERIOD John McCains challenges are going to be nothing compared to what Sen PERIOD Barack Obama is going to face as president PERIOD Im not talking about Sen PERIOD Joseph Bidens continuous efforts to sabotage his running mate by suggesting that the Middle East is going to test Obama PERIOD If he wins the White House Obama can thank himself entirely for the situation he will be in PERIOD Not following Watch Obamas infomercial PERIOD

If youre looking to see if Obama is actually a socialist or even just red to the core then youre out of luck PERIOD Im starting to believe him when he says he isnt a socialist mainly because Im not sure hes decided exactly what he is sort of like his tax policy PERIOD He and Biden both look unable to get a handle on which taxpayers are getting a cut PERIOD Only a few weeks ago under Obamas proposed tax plan tax cuts would go to those making under  a year PERIOD But according to a recent interview with Biden conducted in Scranton Pa. the tax cuts will go to those making under  a year PERIOD If that wasnt confusing enough Obama said during his infomercial that tax cuts would go to those making under  annually PERIOD

Now I can believe that Biden would make such a gaffe but would Obama slip up on an infomercial that costs whoknowshowmuch money Would he mess up on an informercial which proved I hate to say it both extremely wellwritten and produced this close to the election I mean Obama should at the very least be making Chuck Norris nervous PERIOD Just imagine the Total Gym sales. theres just no way it was a mistake PERIOD

And thus we come to what is Obamas real challenge if he is elected PERIOD It wont be convincing Congress to run America down the neverending rabbit hole of debt with his health care plan and it wont be bringing our boys home PERIOD

At this point in the minds of Obamas followers he has all but promised to roll back this country to the golden era of American capitalism following World War II PERIOD The funny thing about the infomercial is that there is a complete disconnect between what Obama is proposing to change and what the people featured in the infomercial actually want PERIOD The unifying gripe of the people in the infomercial is that the economy is changing and that it has been changing PERIOD

The man and woman who work for Ford Motors in Louisville Ky. were particularly striking PERIOD In the infomercial they claim their work at the Ford plant is slowly getting reduced PERIOD The man laments that both his grandfather and father worked for the plant saying they lived in better times. whats Obamas response He tells yet another story about his grandparents PERIOD He then safely segues into a speech about how hes ready to defend America against foreign threats and ends with a promise to support small businesses PERIOD Of course none of the people in the infomercial actually want to work for small businesses PERIOD Who could blame them They arent stable and they dont pay as well PERIOD Basically they cant even begin to offer workers what large corporations can PERIOD But the blame has to go somewhere and since the large corporations are doing all the hiring and thus all the firing theyre a nice scapegoat PERIOD

The tax policy will not be the only part of Obamas economic plan to attenuate slowly should he be elected PERIOD Obama cannot fix what globalization has done to our economy over the last few decades nor can he bring us back to the type of allencompassing prosperity that manufacturing brought us following World War II PERIOD In all fairness McCain cant either but he has made no promises to such an end PERIOD If we need to move on from anything in this country its the belief that we can somehow revert back to an economy of our past PERIOD

Change is not something Obama invented nor is it the refreshing theme he and his supporters claim it is PERIOD As far the economy is concerned change has been the order for many decades now PERIOD Check out Obamas infomercial for its lessthanstellar reviews PERIOD
