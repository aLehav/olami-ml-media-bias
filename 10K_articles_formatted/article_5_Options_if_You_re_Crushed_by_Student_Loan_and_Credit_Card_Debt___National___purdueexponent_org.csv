The return of federal student loan payments in October has the potential to derail your finances especially if youre already struggling with credit card payments PERIOD

One in five student loan borrowers have risk factors that suggest they could struggle with student loan payments when they resume according to a June blog post at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau PERIOD

The impact wont be as significant during the initial 12month student loan onramp period from Oct PERIOD  to Sept   PERIOD You wont default on student loans or see credit scores plummet after missing payments during that time PERIOD But interest will continue to accrue making the growing debt more difficult to manage PERIOD Use the next  months to make progress with consistent payments PERIOD Youll save more money over time and pay down debt faster PERIOD

Here are some strategies to consider as youre getting started PERIOD

An updated budget clarifies how much money is available to pay down debts PERIOD Review your debit and credit card statements for opportunities to cut back or find cheaper alternatives PERIOD

Start by writing down where your money is going says Kristen Holt CEO at GreenPath a nonprofit credit counseling agency PERIOD

Prioritize essentials like rent utilities transportation and others she says PERIOD And if possible work toward building an emergency fund of at least  to prevent more debt PERIOD

Anything is better than nothing Holt says PERIOD Even if youre putting  a paycheck into a savings account it takes a while but its still going to be better than zero. next determine whether youll be laser focused on student loan or credit card debt PERIOD Keep up with all payments but put more money toward the high interest debt to make more progress PERIOD Credit cards typically have higher interest rates unless new terms are applied through an agreement or promotional offer PERIOD

A good credit score of  or higher can qualify you for lowinterest offers PERIOD A balance transfer credit card for instance lets you move debt from a different account onto the card to get a lower interest rate PERIOD The ideal balance transfer card has no annual fee a  introductory interest rate and a reasonable balance transfer fee of  or lower PERIOD If that fee is lower than your current projected interest payments the savings will add up and you can apply them to student loan payments PERIOD

For multiple credit card balances consider a personal loan that consolidates debts into a single lowinterest fixed payment PERIOD

If circumstances beyond your control like an emergency or a layoff are impacting your ability to keep up with payments ask the credit card issuer if it has a hardship plan PERIOD It may temporarily lower interest and waive fees for a specific period of time depending on the issuers terms PERIOD

With an incomedriven repayment plan your monthly payments on federal student loans are based on your income and family size PERIOD The debts are also forgiven after  or  years of payments PERIOD There are currently four incomedriven repayment plans to consider based on your goals and loan type PERIOD

When it comes to student loans you either want to pay them off quickly to save on interest or pay as little as possible to take advantage of any of the forgiveness plans that are available says Rene Earwood an accredited financial counselor and student loan coach PERIOD

It is a casebycase basis depending on how much student loan debt they have what their personal goals are and what their income level is Earwood says PERIOD

If youre already on an incomedriven repayment plan Earwood suggests comparing options in case a different one makes sense for your goals PERIOD For instance those who have undergraduate loans may want to switch to the new SAVE plan because it could cut their payments in half starting in July  and forgive remaining debt more quickly if they have a smaller principal balance PERIOD

When you cant envision making progress on debt a nonprofit credit counseling agency may help PERIOD A credit counselor can review your finances create a budget and determine eligibility for a debt management plan PERIOD This option consolidates credit card balances into a single payment with a lower interest rate for a fee PERIOD If the credit counselor is also a certified student loan expert they can help narrow down the ideal student loan repayment plan PERIOD

Were going to look at the persons whole situation Holt says PERIOD We do a soft pull of their credit report  it does not affect their credit score in any way  but we get that picture of everything. after lowering the costs of your debts avoid adding new purchases on your credit cards PERIOD A temporary switch to a debit card or cash can keep financial goals on track PERIOD

Your credit card wont be closed by the issuer due to inactivity since there is a balance on it and youre making payments PERIOD Once the balance is paid off keep the card open and active with small recurring purchases PERIOD
