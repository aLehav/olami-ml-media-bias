4156,2007-05-15,"despite objections from several thousand students Gov PERIOD Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed a  to  percent University of California fee hike yesterday as part of his  California State Budget revisions PERIOD

Schwarzeneggers revised budget plan which will now be forwarded to the state legislature for approval allocates . billion to the UC system but maintains the UC Regents proposed student fee increases from their March  meeting PERIOD If approved by the legislature undergraduate and graduate students will pay  percent more or roughly  a year while the fees for select law and business schools will increase by an average of  percent PERIOD

Members of the UC Student Association a student lobby organization focused on lowering student fees said they were unhappy with Schwarzeneggers revised budget because it did not provide a  million buyout to cover the regentapproved fee hikes PERIOD The buyout refers to a possible deal wherein the governor could have decided to move money from the budget allocated to other items back into the UC system thus avoiding any reason for a fee increase PERIOD Such a situation occurred last year PERIOD

UCSA President and UCSB Associated Students External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Bill Shiebler said the budget neglects Californias students and their families PERIOD

Today Gov PERIOD Schwarzenegger released his revisions to the  California State Budget with much disappointment to Californias hardworking students and families Shiebler said PERIOD As in the January budget proposal the governor has once again turned his back on higher education by maintaining a  to  percent increase in fees. according to Schwarzeneggers official website the revision adheres to the Higher Education Compact  a longterm agreement between the governor and both the UC and California State University systems PERIOD The compact which lasts through  sets a schedule for increasing student fees in moderate amounts to coincide with state budget projections PERIOD

Secondyear classics major Todd Hunt said he feels paying elevated fees for education is not acceptable PERIOD

I feel it is unfair Hunt said PERIOD If there is going to be changes on the UC campus then sure you can increase fees but if there are not going to be improvements then I dont feel it is justified. a UCSA press release said UC students protested the increase by sending over  postcards and  letters to the state legislature lobbying indistrict and at the Capitol and testifying at Budget and Education Committee hearings PERIOD

Shiebler said the  budget sets a dangerous precedent for future fee hikes PERIOD In the next month before the budget is finalized UCSA plans to continue pressuring legislative leaders he said PERIOD

It is time for the legislature to address the UC access and affordability crisis and take a stand for the future of higher education Shiebler said PERIOD
