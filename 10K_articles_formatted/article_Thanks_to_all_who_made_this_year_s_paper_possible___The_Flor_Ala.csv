With the end of my tenure drawing near I couldnt help but think of what all I have been through during this crazy year of being sports editor for The FlorAla PERIOD

I think the rest of The FlorAla staff would probably agree with me that this was one of the most stressful years we have ever had PERIOD Time management was probably the most difficult thing to deal with especially since I had three jobs PERIOD

Despite all the hardships that occurred I couldnt be more thankful to Student Media for giving me the opportunity to hold this position PERIOD This year has taught me so much I probably would have never gotten PERIOD

Having this position has taught me how to deal with pressure situations ranging from covering big stories to dealing with highranking officials on campus PERIOD In terms of my career it was something I needed to improve on if I wanted to be successful PERIOD

I also wanted to say how thankful I am to have worked with an extremely talented staff Josh Skaggs Andy Thigpen and Alex Lindley PERIOD I think each of them should have no problem making a lot of money once they are out in the job market PERIOD Normally I wouldnt think too highly of my bosses but working under my Executive Editor Lucy Berry has been a real honor PERIOD

She is a very talented writer and I have learned so much by watching and taking as much advice as I could from her PERIOD If it werent for her and the rest of the staff I probably would not have made it through the year PERIOD Im really going to miss coming in on Mondays and having our karaoke moments as we work on our pages PERIOD

I would also like to thank the writers I had for my section who helped me cover many games and issues that occurred during the year PERIOD Without them it would have made it very difficult to do my job as best as I possibly could PERIOD

As for the new staff coming in for next year I hope nothing but the very best and I know they will help make the paper even better than we did this year PERIOD The new group is extremely talented and I know they will get the job done PERIOD

Again I am very thankful to all of those who helped make this years paper possible PERIOD It has been an amazing run being the sports editor for The FlorAla and my goal coming in was to leave it at a better place than it was before PERIOD I hope I achieved it PERIOD
