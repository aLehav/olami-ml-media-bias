Like it or not the virulent gay marriage debate has a healthy future in Massachusetts PERIOD With one proposal banning the divisive practice set to mark ballots in  and an amendment that likely wont be voted on until  currently in the works the polarizing question is going to have plenty of political wind in its sails for the foreseeable future PERIOD 
     Last Wednesday Massachusetts Attorney General Tom democratic candidate for governor in  Reilly ruled that the state constitution permits a new ballot initiative to go forward that would ban gay marriage and make no room for civil unions PERIOD The decision comes as a civil unionsfriendly initiative and makes headway through the legislature as two to three gay couples tie the knot here in Massachusetts each day PERIOD Heres an interesting question What happens to the gay and married if the state bans future marriages
     The problem with the gay marriage debate from a social standpoint is that it is so divisive PERIOD People on both sides of the issue feel like they are being attacked and amendments passed in  states so far have brought about anger and frustration in a broad way unseen since  when the Roe vs PERIOD Wade decision banned antiabortion laws and gave birth to the religious right PERIOD In  the grownup religious right is locked in another social struggle that could grow far uglier than even the prochoiceprolife debate PERIOD
     The gay marriage debate is particularly poisonous because it is a victimizing debate PERIOD People on either side of the issue feel that theyre being attacked PERIOD Those who align themselves against gay marriage feel that their ideas and sensibilities are threatened by the concept of a redefined marriage that defies their social codes PERIOD Those who align themselves in favor of gay marriage feel that the rights and worth of homosexuals as people are called into question by attempts to limit their ability to marry PERIOD A homosexual individual cant help but see the gay marriage debate as an attack on his or her way of life individuals with certain religious backgrounds see the gay marriage debate as an attack on their faith PERIOD
     This victimizing characteristic of the gay marriage debate sets it apart from nearly every other political issue because it attacks so strongly the core beliefs of people PERIOD It is easy to get upset about taxes blaming the rich or getting fired up about spending your own money but in any case taxes are a burden that people dont like to pay and they arent going to feel that their way of life is called into question by the tax code PERIOD Even conflicts in foreign affairs realistically only victimize unwilling soldiers and their families here at home PERIOD Yes those in other countries that we attack are victimized but they dont qualify in terms of domestic strife in the political arena PERIOD Only one other issue abortion parallels gay marriage in victimizing both its opponents and proponents PERIOD 
     Despite its similar victimizing quality the abortion issue does not hit as hard as gay marriage because the people involved in the abortion debate arent personally affected by the decision in the course of the average persons life they are probably not going to have an abortion but they will almost definitely marry PERIOD Whether you are gay or straight the definition of marriage matters when you marry PERIOD The debate over the definition of marriage will eventually trump abortion as the most nocuous dodge that question issue in the political arena because it legitimately affects the lives of so many people PERIOD
     It is hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel on this issue PERIOD The conflict between ideologies it represents doesnt have any apparent resolution except further strife and more hurt feelings PERIOD However this debate is framed and carried out its going to be ugly PERIOD My suggestion keep the other guys in mind and find the compromise PERIOD Good luck Massachusetts PERIOD
