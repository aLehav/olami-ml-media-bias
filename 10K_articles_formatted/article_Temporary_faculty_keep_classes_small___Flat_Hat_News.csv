8447,2023-11-05,"the College of William and Mary is recognized as one of the top small public universities in the country PERIOD But how small can it stay and for how much longer

Class sizes appear stable but the number of classes offered by the College has shifted PERIOD  The number of classes in the school of Arts and Sciences has diminished by  percent in recent years PERIOD  In the  academic year  classes were offered PERIOD  Currently only  classes are available PERIOD

Despite the nationwide economic recession and budget cuts the College is dedicated to maintaining small class sizes according to Dean of Arts and Sciences Carl Strikwerda PERIOD Nevertheless the number of tenured faculty has suffered PERIOD

What has been a challenge is continuing to have a large proportion of classes taught by tenureeligible and tenured faculty Strikwerda said PERIOD Because of the budget cuts we have had to cancel some searches for tenureeligible faculty over the last two years. this problem is not limited to the College PERIOD  According to Strikwerda Harvard University stopped searching for tenureeligible professors three years ago PERIOD

The College has not completely called off its search however PERIOD The arts and sciences department currently has  active searches for tenureeligible faculty in progress PERIOD

In comparison to many other institutions weve continued to hire at a reasonable rate Strikwerda said PERIOD
With the cut in tenured faculty the College has looked to temporary professors to keep class sizes small PERIOD

We have been able to use temporary faculty to keep class sizes the same Strikwerda said PERIOD  Given the very large budget cuts that we have absorbed over the last three years I believe the leaders of the College deserve a lot of credit for shielding our core educational mission from the effect of the cuts. according to Strikwerda his office alongside department chairs and program directors works to limit the number of larger classes PERIOD Statistics provided by the deans office show that there are only  classes in the School of Arts and Sciences with  or more students  this represents  percent of total classes PERIOD  The largest percentage of classes  percent consists of  to  students PERIOD

These numbers are an improvement from years past according to Susan Donaldson chair of the English department PERIOD

When I first came to the English department at the College both the upper and lowerlevel English courses were often quite large Donaldson said PERIOD

In the early 1990s the English department established a policy limiting literature classes to  students PERIOD  Freshman and senior seminars were also capped at  students PERIOD The English department grants professors the ability to include a few extra students although it tries to maintain reasonable class sizes PERIOD

The English department offers one class Literature and the Bible which can reach over  students PERIOD  According to Donaldson this class does not require any substantial essays from its participants PERIOD

The main reason why the English Department is determined to keep seminars at  and literature classes at  is that all of our classes are writing intensive Donaldson said PERIOD

Classes of such large numbers make it difficult for students to participate as well as receive the proper help from professors on writing assignments PERIOD

The English department is committed to making it possible for active student participation in class and for faculty to pay close attention to student writing Donaldson said PERIOD

Although the recession has hit the College hard class sizes and enrollment appear to be relatively unaffected PERIOD

Our undergraduate enrollment has only gone up about  percent over the last three years Strikwerda said PERIOD
