Owner of Nash and Proper students discuss new food trucks popularity

Theres a new food truck in town serving UC Davis Nashville style hot chicken with a California twist. nash and Proper which has garnered attention at the Silo for its lengthy lines is coowned by chefs Cecil Rhodes and Jake Bombard PERIOD

Rhodes is also the owner of Cecils Taste which previously operated a food truck that served food at the Silo PERIOD The menu for Cecils Taste included smoked pork belly and burgers but Rhodes noticed that there were a number of UC Davis students who dont eat beef or pork.The vegetarian burger sold well and lots of people asked him about a chicken option PERIOD That was when Rhodes started playing around with a recipe for a chicken sandwich PERIOD

I started selling it when we were at UC Davis and we started selling out Rhodes said PERIOD We were going through about  pounds of chicken a week between UC Davis and UC Merced PERIOD Thats kind of when the light bulb went off  this could be a concept. at that point it was just a straightup chicken sandwich Rhodes said PERIOD About four years ago he began hearing a lot about Nashville hot chicken  KFC even added a Nashville hot chicken sandwich something Rhodes characterized as absolutely horrible. rhodes continued to serve his chicken sandwich as it was but then he heard about Howlin Rays a successful Nashville hot chicken restaurant in Los Angeles that began as a food truck PERIOD

I started studying Nashville hot chicken Rhodes said PERIOD I started messing around with a recipe and came up with our hot oil that we dip our chicken in and our different levels of spices. rhodes wanted a firehot chicken food truck that imbued the feel of a picnic and thus Nash and Proper was born PERIOD The truck offers chicken tenders wings and the famous Sammich which has amassed a huge social media presence PERIOD Customers can choose from one of five levels of heat  naked mild medium hot and cluckin hot PERIOD

The Sammich which consists of crispy fried boneless thigh slaw fuego sauce and pickles served in a bun is the most popular item but at UC Davis it faces close competition with the Quarter Bird which includes a boneless leg and thigh served with bread and pickles  a menu item that never makes it in the top two at the trucks other locations PERIOD

Students may need a little bit of money to go a long way Rhodes said PERIOD With the Quarter Bird its a really big piece of chicken PERIOD You could probably feed yourself three times with that same order PERIOD Its delicious food I think its affordable. natalie Sahabandu a firstyear graduate student in the biochemistry molecular cellular and developmental biology group went to Nash and Proper with a friend who works in Davis and had heard the hype about the food truck from coworkers PERIOD Sahabandu ordered the Quarter Bird cluckin hot which she said was just a little too spicy for her  she plans to order it hot next time PERIOD

I think the food is really good but in general its really worth the money Sahabandu said PERIOD For  bucks you get gigantic pieces of chicken which can go for two meals  for a student I think that is very accommodating and very attractive. she compared Nash and Propers popularity to that of Shahs Halal which she believes also has a good foodtomoney ratio PERIOD

Secondyear chemistry graduate student Winston Chow decided to return to Nash and Proper after trying it a few times and enjoying it PERIOD

I think it tastes a lot better than a lot of the food trucks here but thats just personal preference Chow said PERIOD I think what draws people in is that you see a really long line that youre almost like Oh that must be really good so I might as well get in line and try it out. passersby seemed to have mixed opinions on this  some students walked by and took videos of the long lines while others appeared to be considering whether or not to join the line PERIOD One student said People in California are either too patient or just crazy why would you wait in such a long line

Secondyear statistics and biochemistry double major Christine Zhou was drawn in by the long lines she saw PERIOD Zhou had never tried food from the truck but planned to order the chicken thigh naked since shes not a spicy person

Im just curious Zhou said PERIOD You want to find out why theres always a long line for this chicken. rhodes said the popularity of the truck can be attributed to the fact that the food is delicious which is something that people gravitate toward as well as the trucks social media presence PERIOD They see about  people a day at UC Davis  and not all of them are associated with the university PERIOD Some like Sahabandus friend work in Davis but Rhodes said there are some people who tell him they came to Davis from West Sacramento to try the food PERIOD

We really appreciate coming out to UC Davis and the love from all the students and the staff Rhodes said PERIOD Were really grateful for what we have we dont take anything for granted PERIOD We always want to put smiles on peoples faces PERIOD We always want to deliver a delicious product PERIOD And you know when its reciprocated with people standing in line for  minutes its really humbling. written by Anjini Venugopal  featurestheaggie.org
