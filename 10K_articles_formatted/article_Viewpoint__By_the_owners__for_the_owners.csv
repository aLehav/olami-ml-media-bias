The ownership society PERIOD The phrase has a nice ring to it even if you arent the sort of committed conservative who wishes death and defunding upon every remnant of President Lyndon Johnsons Great Society PERIOD The rhetoric that surrounds President Bushs notion of the ownership society inevitably hearkens back to deeply rooted American ideals of liberty independence and selfreliance PERIOD

For Daily columnist John Stiglich The ownership society  and many other conservatives those three words seem to be the greatest thing to come along in American political life since that special morning when the Great Communicator singlehandedly dismantled the Evil Empire by telling Mr PERIOD Gorbachev to tear down some wall PERIOD

A closer look at Bushs ownership society though reveals that its policies would do much for those who already have much  and do little for those who already have little PERIOD This isnt an accident its the very design of a proposal driven by a freemarket ideology deeply hostile to the egalitarian policies that have given fair opportunities to tens of millions of Americans PERIOD

Take for example the idea of health savings accounts PERIOD Those struggling to get by arent likely to have much money left over at the end of the month to throw into a nifty health savings account PERIOD But for those with the right combination of health and affluence health savings accounts are a nice tax dodge PERIOD

Privatizing Social Security is another core policy in the ownership society PERIOD Bushs failure to sell the idea to a skeptical nation hasnt discouraged true believers PERIOD Stiglich got so excited about privatization that he even said funds for Social Security will dry up in  PERIOD Thats not well true PERIOD Even without reform the Social Security trust fund should let the system pay its bills until  or so PERIOD With enough ideology who needs research

Traditional motifs of American discourse like freemarket ideology are the most important components of the ownership society PERIOD Crucially one of those tropes is late 19thcentury upbythebootstraps social Darwinism PERIOD

In the ownership society government isnt supposed to do much of anything and workers arent supposed to organize to demand a fair deal through collective bargaining PERIOD Once were truly living in the ownership society anyone who isnt doing well economically should simply be seen as having foolishly mismanaged assets PERIOD

When  percent of the blame for poverty lands squarely on the poor theres no conceivable moral justification for any silly bleedingheart redistribution of wealth PERIOD Even today you cant vocally advocate redistribution of wealth but it sneaks by here and there through things like subsidized student loans food stamps and Medicaid PERIOD In the ownership society though there will be no need for an equitable distribution of wealth or opportunity PERIOD The free market will allocate capital and assign prices for education and health care for example as the invisible hand deems fit PERIOD And thats that PERIOD

Economic growth under such a scenario wont be as great as ownership society advocates hope PERIOD As bright young people find a college education utterly beyond their means and resign themselves to menial labor our nation will inexorably lose its competitive edge in a technologyoriented world economy PERIOD The wealthy elites who benefit most from ownershipsociety policies might find themselves frittering away their capital on security systems should a particular pastime popular in other countries with grossly unjust distributions of wealth  kidnapping for ransom  emerge as an American phenomenon PERIOD And once health care is carefully rationed solely on the basis of ability to pay workforce productivity will suffer somewhat due to the probable increase in mortality rate PERIOD

Personally I prefer to live in a country where people realize that society functions better morally as well as economically with the occasional deviations from laissez faire dogma that are necessary to ensure the existence of a strong middle class and something resembling equality of opportunity PERIOD If Stiglich thinks that makes me a Socialist then so be it PERIOD
