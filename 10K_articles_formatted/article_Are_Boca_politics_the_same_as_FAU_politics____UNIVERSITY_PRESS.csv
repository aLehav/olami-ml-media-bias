The students in Prof PERIOD Pamela Brannons Issues in American Politics class are discussing their chapter on health and welfare today PERIOD Every week these students discuss the big issues such as Social Security and foreign policy PERIOD Heated debates on racial profiling and separation of church and state are a regular occurrence here everyone has an opinion and wants to be heard PERIOD Most students have something to say about the national issues or presidential elections PERIOD Yet most students cant even name the local mayor and city counsel members PERIOD Why Because local politics dont affect us or who cares about what city officials do most students say PERIOD Im more interested in foreign and international issues says Beata Korkiuk a senior History major in Brannons class PERIOD I dont even know what is going on locally which is probably a mistake PERIOD You see these campaign signs everywhere but you have no idea who these people are. korkiuk feels that although some students may care we just dont have the time to keep up with whats going on locally. others she says dont feel affected by local policies so they see no need to get involved PERIOD

But local politics do affect FAU and its students as issues like traffic and construction climb to the forefront of the local agenda PERIOD Although FAU is a state agency Boca politics influence what goes on around campus shaping FAUs environment PERIOD Students will get the opportunity to make their priorities count when the city of Boca holds elections for mayor and two city counsel seats on March  PERIOD In the mayoral race twoterm incumbent Steven Abrams faces local Pastor Mark Boykin PERIOD These candidates sharply contrasting viewpoints on city and FAU issues have made for a heated race PERIOD

A central issue at FAU now is congestion something FAU students over  of whom are commuters face everyday PERIOD Students not only have to deal with gridlock on I95 and Glades Road but also on campus PERIOD Long lines of cars choke up FAUs streets each morning and afternoon with added traffic from the Henderson school located on the east side of the campus PERIOD Solutions such as widening Glades or adding a new exit from I95 that goes directly to the school have been proposed PERIOD Boykin says at this point there is no other choice but to add the exit PERIOD We are in a state of urgency and City Hall doesnt seem to see it he says PERIOD They keep building but do not address the traffic and congestion its creating. however Abrams says that making a direct exit off of I95 to FAU is now one of the citys top priorities PERIOD It is a regional project that will require cooperation with a number of groups and Abrams proudly cites that the city has gained support from most of them PERIOD As for this projects timetable Abrams says that it is as soon as we can get it done PERIOD Planning work is already being undertaken. another traffic solution may come from the Department of Transportation which has been looking into adding a combination of full or partial exits from the Turnpike including ones to Palmetto and Yamato a move that would ease the traffic on other major roads and be helpful for Broward commuting students PERIOD Funding for these proposals which would come from both the city and the state is the main obstacle PERIOD These projects are in the early stages Abrams says PERIOD I would want city traffic engineers to look at the proposal before any action is taken. although FAU officials seek to alleviate traffic around campus they have proposed two major building projects a new stadium and a teaching hospital PERIOD Proponents of these projects talk of school improvement the football team would have a place to play right on campus and FAU medical students wouldnt have to go to the University of Miami for med school and internships PERIOD Opponents however cite that these new projects would increase the already high commuter traffic and add to FAUs congestion problem PERIOD Abrams says he is very excited about the new hospital. he believes having a stateoftheart hospital with a training program will ensure the Boca Hospitals success PERIOD As for the stadium Abrams says he has been working with President Brogan but the project doesnt really involve the city PERIOD The main thing is that FAU needs to raise the funds he says PERIOD Boykin also endorses both projects although one of his main campaign thrusts is controlling development PERIOD Boykin says that anything that is going to integrate the school and make it more mainstream is important. he believes that they will help FAU become a major school PERIOD As for the congestion they may cause Boykin says the stadium would not add to weekday traffic since it would be used mostly on the weekends PERIOD

In addition to congestion caused by these projects there is also the question of preserving the T Buildings PERIOD They are some of the last remnants of FAUs past as a former WW II airbase PERIOD The previous FAU president ordered that the T Buildings which are located by the police station be knocked down to make room for more growth PERIOD President Brogan and groups like Boca Raton Army Airfield Force BRAAF are fighting to preserve these historical monuments. however preserving and restoring the T Buildings would cost extra money PERIOD Mayor Abrams supports the preservation efforts and says that the city will cooperate however they can PERIOD We have some say on this issue PERIOD I think that the best way to preserve these buildings is to find someone who wants to use them. he says that a charter school was interested in using the buildings but suspended their plans after some opposition from the Henderson school on campus PERIOD Boykin on the other hand believes only buildings with historic significance like where an important bill was signed for example should be saved otherwise they should be leveled to make room PERIOD These buildings shouldnt be saved just because they are old PERIOD They occupy too much valuable space for that. not only a statewide issue but also a big FAU issue is Scripps Florida whose temporary home is at FAUs Jupiter campus PERIOD The Californiabased biotech company had planned for its Florida branch to be moved into its new home by Nov PERIOD  but the process has been stalled by lawsuits from environmental groups over the purposed building site PERIOD Even though temporary buildings are being built on the Jupiter campus to house them space is limited and the longer Scripps goes without a home the longer the school is spending money and resources to accommodate them PERIOD Last month President Brogan began efforts to help break the deadlock and get Scripps into its permanent home but progress has been slow PERIOD Boykin believes that the core of this issue is listening to the community and the students PERIOD People need to be heard because it affects their quality of life he says PERIOD We are building without consent from the community and thats got to stop. abrams who was a chairman on FAUs transition team which supervised Scripps move from the Boca to the Jupiter Campus took a different stance PERIOD He says that Scripps has been and will continue to be a benefit for FAU PERIOD Boca will get financial benefits without the traffic costs he says PERIOD Abrams also added that because of Scripps FAU has its new Biomedical Science Building PERIOD

Campus fraternities and sororities are also looking to get a piece of FAUs building action PERIOD They are campaigning for campus housing or frat rows for their groups PERIOD With limited space and lots of groups vying for it a project like this could meet some steep opposition PERIOD Boykin believes that building frat rows would help transform FAU into a college of influence. however he added that their just isnt enough room to accommodate whole rows of buildings PERIOD A project like this can be done if it is done the right way he says PERIOD Abrams took a similar stance saying I would have to see what the plan was before I made a decision about it. he takes pride in the relationship he has cultivated between the city and FAU PERIOD I like to think I know what is going on at FAU and what the students needs are he says PERIOD He also adds that the city has a number of programs that benefit FAU students including a new emergency notification system called CodeRED PERIOD

These candidates dont see eye to eye on most issues but they do agree that students need to get involved PERIOD Mayor Abrams hopes that the student body will continue the interest that they had for the presidential election this year into local politics PERIOD He says that student groups like the College Republicans have been a big help and encourages everyone to get involved since this a nonpartisan election PERIOD This local election is so important because it will affect the FAU students. boykin also encourages students to participate PERIOD We listen to what students have to say he says PERIOD Students have the most influential voice if they would just exercise their right. fAU Communications student Carl Schachter really sums things up PERIOD I hear students complaining about everything from tuition costs to traffic but when I ask what they are doing to get involved and change it they shrug PERIOD If students dont get involved or vote why should local government care about what we have to say
