5189,2017-03-20,"the English indierock band Circa Waves released their second studio albumDifferent CreaturesFriday PERIOD The album includes  new songs that highlight the bands desire to roughen up their image and add more hardrock elements to their music style PERIOD

Different Creaturesshowcases a range of edgy guitar riffs and powerful drum fills unlike their  albumYoung Chasers which had more twangy alternativestyle melodies and cheerful happyday vibes PERIOD Different Creatures is an angstdriven masterpiece that overloads the soul PERIOD

This ones a lot more about the demons that I face a lot of love loss and anxiety lead singer Kieran Shudall said to NME when asked of the inspiration behind the albums darkness PERIOD

The first track Wake Up sets the tone for Different Creaturesright off the bat PERIOD A blaring guitar riff and rigorous drum line with Shudalls distinctvoice piercing through the instrumentals evoke a sense of familiarity to fans PERIOD

Just likeWake Up the other songs on the album have enthralling introductions that leave the listener begging for more PERIOD In Fire that Burns a chaotic introduction witha mashup of loud drums and guitars suddenly diverges into a more streamlined slower melody PERIOD Shudalls voice brings a sense ofstability to the chaos PERIOD

Along withthe solid introductions I really enjoyed the song placement within the album PERIOD The first few tracksare edgy and intense they portray the bands efforts to add some darkness and heavier rock to their music PERIOD Goodbye the third song in the album is very fierce and loud PERIOD However it is followed by the more toneddown soulful aesthetic of Out On My Own. and as epic as the fastpaced heavy songs are it is nice to take a break and listen to something softer while still keeping the overall tone of the album PERIOD

This contrastis most pronounced in the final song of the albumOld Friends.The song starts off with what sounds like a group of people having a muffled conversation PERIOD Eventually a bluesy melody kicks in witha moody guitar and light drum beat PERIOD The instrumentals and background vocals made up of soft ohs portray the singers frustration towards a possessive significant other PERIOD Towards the end the hardrock element enters the song asthe vocalists builtup aggression comes out PERIOD The calming effect of the songs initial melody is shattered by raspy and loud vocals and horns PERIOD

One of my favorite tracks Loves Run Out is a stark contrast to the high energy of the rest of the album.Itdigs deep into the listeners emotions the lyrics portray the depth of the underlying love that inspired the track PERIOD Shudall sings the song tenderly and delicately with the backdrop ofan acoustic guitar PERIOD One of the most notable aspects of the song is its conclusion the guitar stops and the singer says She texted me Jordan in a hopeful tone PERIOD The ending makesLoves Run Out the manifestationof a perfect love song with a personal edge PERIOD

Different Creatures is a really commendable album PERIOD I appreciate Circa Waves efforts to appeal to a more diverse audience of music appreciators such as hardrock and even punkrock fans PERIOD But I also like how the band threw in a few more classic alternative songs to keep their altrock loving fans happy PERIOD

From the intriguing introductions to its great mix of tones the album has a lotto offer PERIOD The most notable features include the dark instrumentals and Shudalls distinct voice whichcontinuously reminds me of why I enjoy listening to Circa Waves PERIOD

I give Different Creatures a  PERIOD I definitely see myself jamming to these songs on epic road trips and even walks to class in the future PERIOD

Circa Waves are currently touring in the U.K PERIOD
