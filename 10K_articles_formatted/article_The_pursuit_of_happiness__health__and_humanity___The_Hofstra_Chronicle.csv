The connection between psychological fulfillment and physical health is one which is continuously being explored within the relatively recent field of positive psychology PERIOD Scientists have for at least a decade been discovering that a life lived with deep fulfillment strong personal relationships meaningful goals and regular positive emotions can carry enormous health benefits PERIOD Happiness isnt just a wonderful thing to feel it can actually improve your physical health PERIOD

Needless to say there is still concern over the implications of claiming that feeling positive is an absolute gateway to overall health PERIOD Richard P PERIOD Sloan in his New York Times OpEd piece  rightly points out that possessing positivity and enviable personality traits such as compassion or faith have little effect on whether someone survives a disease PERIOD Studies performed by positive psychologists Ed Diener and Robert BiswasDiener have revealed that the expression of frequent positive emotions do not improve a persons chances of recovery from a lifethreatening condition PERIOD However there is substantial evidence to suggest that being genuinely happy increases ones lifespan and makes one less susceptible to contracting health problems PERIOD

I think the issue that most troubles Dr PERIOD Sloan as well as many others in light of the recent popular market for happiness are the implications of believing that happiness and positivity unconditionally lead to a healthy life PERIOD Dr PERIOD Sloan writes  It may be more advantageous to be positive in life although to claim it is more virtuous especially when one is suffering with cancer seems callous PERIOD

It would be erroneous however to say that there is no correlation between positivity and physical health PERIOD Experiencing emotions and thoughts produces a physiological reaction if I feel anxious my heart rate quickens my breathing becomes shallower and my nervous system releases adrenaline PERIOD Sometimes a single anxious thought may be enough to begin the cycle PERIOD If I experience these symptoms too regularly over time my body is going to begin to show the effects of the accumulated stress on it PERIOD People who are depressed have a much higher likelihood of suffering a heart attack PERIOD On the contrary those who are happier more of the time have been found to have stronger immune systems and are more resilient to illnesses PERIOD

There are of course multiple factors potentially influencing whether someone contracts a disease PERIOD Simply being happy does not serve as immunity against any serious illness PERIOD What it does do however is tilt the odds in your favor that you will generally live longer and may be physically healthier PERIOD
