Doubledegree saxophonist Nathan Rice performs a solo during Tuesdays Celebrating John Coltrane Concert PERIOD A group of jazz musicians represented Coltranes diverse repertoire with dynamic interpretations of his music PERIOD

Vida Weisblum Arts EditorSeptember  

Late jazz legend John Coltrane would have been proud Tuesday evening when a collective of Jazz majors assembled at the Cat in the Cream to pay tribute to the saxophonist with a celebratory performance featuring many of his works PERIOD The student musicians skillfully captured Coltranes dynamic and colorful repertoire and more importantly their candid performance displayed the enrapturing effect of Coltranes music PERIOD

Michael Od a Conservatory sophomore Jazz Percussion major who organized the performance sent out an email to friends and fellow jazz musicians a few weeks ago that detailed his intentions to put together a concert in honor of the saxophone idol PERIOD Everyone who plays jazz has been influenced by Coltrane said junior Jazz Saxophone major Jake Abramson but Mike did a really good job of choosing musicians who had been particularly influenced by Coltranes music. according to Zachary Warren Jazz Trombone major and senior the group of musicians rarely rehearsed the set list as a group PERIOD

Od garnered a slew of enthusiastic responses from several fellow jazz musicians and together the group produced a varied yet streamlined production PERIOD Despite not being a saxophonist Od has strong ties to Coltranes brand of jazz PERIOD John Coltrane has been a really big influence on my musical development Od said PERIOD Hes probably one of the main reasons I went to school to study jazz. the musicians developed passion for Coltrane has been fueled by similar admiration for the saxophonist among Ods professors including Billy Hart assistant professor of Jazz Percussion PERIOD The thing about Coltranes music is that its very spiritual said Warren who is taking a semester off but returned to campus for the concert PERIOD Just to play that music is an experience within itself. for Warren Coltranes music is more than just an inspiration but flows through those who play it and listen to it PERIOD Its not about being wrong or right he said PERIOD Its about playing what you feel. the first act of the show included some of Coltranes earlier works including songs from his second album Blue Train while the second act featured music from later in his life such as Coltranes familiar version of My Favorite Things PERIOD Whereas many other jazz performances  albeit technically sound  lack a theme the Coltrane concert provided a unifying reason to gather PERIOD Though the audience was mostly composed of Conservatory Jazz majors whose music careers have all presumably been touched by Coltrane in some manner the vibe in the Cat was welcoming toward people who just wanted to listen to some Coltrane PERIOD Not only did audience members get to hear classics from a beloved artist but they were also treated to the sheer passion and impressive talent of a group of young musicians PERIOD

Although the performance centered on a renowned saxophonist each of the instrumentalists included in the performance  trumpetplayers pianists bassists and guitarists  all contributed to the musicians fierce zeal for Coltrane and honored the aspects of their own skill that have been influenced by him PERIOD The event did not appear to feature the saxophone at the exclusion of other instruments even Jazz Saxophone major and doubledegree sophomore Mel Maetzener who played a starring role appeared in the second act playing an alto clarinet PERIOD During some of the songs more than one musician would perform on the same instrument creating a powerful sound that positively affected the crowds spirit PERIOD The concert was exciting with each of the performers getting a brief moment of glory during their solo PERIOD Though Ode was the only musician who was featured on every song of the evening the true zenith of the concert occurred when Jazz Percussion major and senior Zaire Dardens unbelievable drum solo in the second act caused jaws to drop PERIOD

Ode said that the highlight of the performance was the uplifting vibe in the room. jazz Trumpet major and sophomore No Mina said he agreed It was cool too because not all the musicians that play get to come together for one concert. ode nodded his head in agreement PERIOD Its hard to pull out one highlight collectively he said PERIOD

With regard to his experience Warren said It was a blessing to hear everybody express themselves on stage and to sit and listen to somebody else interpret the special melodies of Coltrane. ode is set on making the event an annual one and fellow Jazz majors are similarly enthused about the impressive outcome of the concert PERIOD
