Posted by The Editorial Board  Feb    Editorials Opinion  

Syracuse Universitys N.Y. suspension of  students who organized a sitin earlier this week to protest campus bigotry blatantly obstructed students right to free expression PERIOD This injustice raises significant questions surrounding the implementation of Emorys own free speechrelated policies PERIOD While Syracuses administration has since lifted those suspensions that such harsh punishments were levied in the first place should serve as a wakeup call for all institutions of higher education PERIOD

Syracuse had an equal obligation to protect both students right to free expression and their safety PERIOD No college should abet the trauma of violent demonstration as occurred during the  Unite the Right rally at the University of Virginia or the  riot at at the Georgia Institute of Technology PERIOD Given that only threats of immediate bodily harm should permit universities to assert their authority over protesters PERIOD Since the Syracuse sitin was entirely peaceful the universitys administration had no grounds on which to interfere PERIOD

In punishing the protesters while failing to adequately investigate the incidences of racism antiSemitism and homophobia which sparked their demonstration the university acted unevenly and with considerable bias PERIOD Unless the university can prevent further incidents of bigotry such events will continue PERIOD Furthermore penalizing a peaceful demonstration both constrains political activity and impairs the universitys ability to respond to genuinely violent demonstrations PERIOD

Faced with comparable incidents Emory has failed as well PERIOD In  the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity house was vandalized with antiSemitic symbols shortly after the end of the Hebrew holiday of Yom Kippur PERIOD While the administration took steps to punish those involved it did not adequately heal the community as further bias incidents occurred in the following weeks PERIOD Similarly last year Emory Students for Justice in Palestines diein and associated protests rocked our community PERIOD

After the protests we criticized the Emory community for failing to engage in civil discussion we believe that the underlying causes of that failure still exist the most notable being a lack of leadership from above PERIOD University President Claire E PERIOD Sterks response to the event did little to ease tensions PERIOD While her email to the student body at the time mentioned resources for Jewish students experiencing discomfort about the protests it said nothing about resources for ESJP protesters who received death threats PERIOD ESJPs protest was legitimate under the Universitys Open Expression Policy PERIOD The protesters should have received the same respect and support from the administration as those with whom they took issue PERIOD

The Office of the President can either help or hurt our community which makes the search for a new president pivotal to our community PERIOD Emory needs a seasoned leader in tune with the culture and clashes on campus who can guide us through the conflicts that seem to define the Emory student experience PERIOD

The events at Syracuse should push Emory administrators to rethink their application and interpretation of the Open Expression Policy on student protesters PERIOD The Syracuse administration did not use the correct tools to deal with the extreme racial bias incidents and rebuked students who were justly highlighting the administrations poor response PERIOD Emorys analogous past mimics a larger trend on college campuses across the nation that must be addressed PERIOD If our administration truly values students right to express themselves freely it must protect future student protesters by equitably and impartially applying policies that regulate free speech PERIOD
