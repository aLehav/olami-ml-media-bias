Updated November     pm



In basketball theres that huge dunk that brings down the house PERIOD Theres the ferocious block that gets the crowd riled up PERIOD And theres that slick pass that sometimes makes your head spin PERIOD

Then theres the 3pointer PERIOD

 head coach Lorenzo Romar said PERIOD

If thats the case then the Washington mens basketball team sure must be feeling good this season PERIOD

Ranked fifth in the nation averaging a ridiculous . 3pointers per game the Huskies have been at times unstoppable from behind the arc PERIOD Five UW players have made more than  shots from downtown in just  games so far this season and the Huskies lead the Pac10 with  3pointers PERIOD Its helped the UW average a conferenceleading . points per game PERIOD

Romar said he hasnt had a team shoot the 3ball so well even the  squad that had shooters like Nate Robinson Tre Simmons and Brandon Roy PERIOD

Isaiah Thomas who also leads the team in points per game and assists per game is tied for first on the team with  3pointers this season PERIOD Right there with him is his cocaptain Justin Holiday who has also made  3pointers and is shooting  percent from downtown PERIOD

On a team that has a dangerous perimeter attack hitting that clutch 3pointer can provide countless benefits PERIOD

 said assistant coach Jim Shaw PERIOD 

And it isnt just during the game when good shooting helps PERIOD

 Holiday said PERIOD 

Dont think  just shoot

Having lots of talented shooters on one team means that youre going to have a lot of gunslingers who arent afraid to shoot the ball and that often results in lots and lots of shots PERIOD

So its almost inevitable that during some games there are going to be players who hit cold streaks PERIOD Even if Romar has proven shooters like redshirt freshman C.J PERIOD Wilcox  3pointers made junior Scott Suggs  made or freshman Terrence Ross  made sometimes the rock just wont fall in the basket PERIOD

Does Romar tell his guys to stop shooting Does he yell at them Does he say anything

 the ninthyear head coach said PERIOD 

 Romar said PERIOD 

That doesnt mean everyone gets to shoot whenever they want  not if they havent proven they can be a consistent shooter already PERIOD

 Romar said PERIOD 

One of those players is Holiday who also knows something about thinking too much PERIOD The senior was hot from downtown to start the season knocking down  3pointers in the first six games PERIOD

But then he hit somewhat of a slump earlier this month capped off by an 0for8 first half against Stanford this past weekend PERIOD In the second half though he bounced back to finish 6for17 in the game PERIOD And then against Cal Sunday he made a careerhigh five 3pointers en route to  points in the UWs  win PERIOD

 Holiday said PERIOD 

Even hesitating for that split second when an open shot presents itself can prove costly PERIOD Its something Romar harps about in practice PERIOD

 Holiday said PERIOD

Romar hasnt had many chances this season to be angry with his shooters for not shooting PERIOD In fact the Huskies have attempted  or more 3pointers in  games this season and in each of the past four games PERIOD

Yet the ninthyear head coach doesnt think his team lives and dies by the 3point shot by any means PERIOD

 Romar said PERIOD

Its safe to say that when these Huskies get hot from behind the arc really good might be the best way to describe them PERIOD
