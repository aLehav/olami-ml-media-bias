5268,2016-11-12,"it may not have been the highstakes StanfordOregon game that the Pac12 has come to expect but the offensive firepower was certainly there PERIOD At least for one side PERIOD

In the first unranked matchup between the two teams since  the Stanford Cardinal   Pac12 delivered an offensive beatdown to the ailing Oregon Ducks   outscoring the Ducks 5227for their most impressive offensive performance this season PERIOD

Junior running back Christian McCaffrey led the way for Stanford rushing for  yards and  touchdowns as he surpassed  rushing yards on the season PERIOD But Stanfords other two backs got involved as well as sophomores Bryce Love and Cameron Scarlett combined for  rushing yards and a score PERIOD

In the passing game Stanford was just as sensational as it was on the ground PERIOD Junior quarterback Keller Chryst passed for  yards and  touchdowns and sophomore wide receiver JJ ArcegaWhiteside recorder Stanfords first 100yard receiving game PERIOD

The Ducks offenseseemed to gain momentum at times as freshman quarterback Justin Herbert played an admirable game under center PERIOD However the big story for the Ducks was the four turnovers which led to  points for Stanford PERIOD Some unfortunate mistakes from Herberts two end zone interceptions to a fumble on a punt that hit the back of an Oregon defender spelled doom for a team that couldnt manage to get out of its rut PERIOD

Stanford cruised to a  lead at the half its largest output in one half since its opener against UC Davis in  PERIOD Oregon never managed to get anything going from that point and its unfortunate defensive performance kept it from keeping the game within reach PERIOD

Stanford will next travel to Berkeley to take on California in the one hundred and nineteenth Big Game PERIOD Meanwhile Oregon will travel south to take on Utah as it looks to salvage a miserable season PERIOD
