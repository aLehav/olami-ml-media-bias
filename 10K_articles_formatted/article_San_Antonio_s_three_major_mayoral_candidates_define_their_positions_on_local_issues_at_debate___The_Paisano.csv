The crowd was a mix of undecided voters supporters of all three candidates local activist groups and reporters PERIOD

Freshman global affairs major and MOVE San Antonio intern JayLen Boone stated I enjoyed watching them go back and forth PERIOD Especially the quarrel between Taylor and Medina but I would definitely have to say Nirenberg won me over with his positions on the railway and the civil rights questions covering Senate Bill  and Senate Bill . councilman Nirenberg opposes SB  and believes it infringes on transgender rights and could damage the citys business community PERIOD

Nirenberg stressed the importance of local control and stands in opposition to SB  with San Antonio Police Chief William McManus PERIOD

I trust our chief more than a politician in Austin Nirenberg affirmed PERIOD

Despite the contention Taylor Nirenberg and Medina strongly agree on one solution to the San AntonioAustin traffic problem a railway PERIOD All three candidates support constructing a bullet train from San Antonio to the state capitol PERIOD

Yes I support the railway Political science graduate student Ananda Torres said It would make so many of our lives easier and reduce traffic on the highway PERIOD Plus it would help the environment PERIOD I also think a railway between the two cities can bring in revenue PERIOD Now students from San Antonio have a cheap way to get to and from that concert in Austin. the bullet train will help eliminate traffic and parking congestion sophomore biology major Chelsea Castaneda said PERIOD

Traffic and crime affect students who travel from home to campus on a daily basis PERIOD

Being a commuter takes more time for driving and leaving late from school makes me worry about on campus crimes and crimes in the area Castaneda said PERIOD
