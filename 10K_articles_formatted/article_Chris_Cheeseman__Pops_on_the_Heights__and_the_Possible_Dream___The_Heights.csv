3693,2017-10-11,"the applause comes to a close and silence overtakes the crowd PERIOD He knows whats coming next PERIOD

Alright youre up. the stage manager shuffles Chris Cheeseman CSOM  into position PERIOD

This is it he thinks stepping forward just offstage PERIOD

His heart races a moment nervous like never before PERIOD Opposite the curtain await  people PERIOD Thats at least two times bigger than his biggest crowd PERIOD And he wont be passing through on stage for a theatrical stint like he is used to doing PERIOD Cheeseman will be the center of attentionall alonefor a whole song PERIOD He has a piece to sing all his own at the twenty-fifth annual Pops on the Heights Scholarship Gala PERIOD Cheeseman has prepared for months and knows he is ready PERIOD But his pestilent nerves linger on PERIOD He thinks of the sage advice his voice coach gave him when staring down an great challenge If youre not nervous youre not ready PERIOD

Center yourself he thinks PERIOD

Then he hears his name introduced PERIOD

Woah he says to himself PERIOD This is about to be so cool. keith Lockhart and the Boston Pops Orchestra welcome him on stage PERIOD He cant believe it walking to his position PERIOD Light hits his face center stage PERIOD He can barely make out the faces of those in the first row of tables PERIOD But everywhere else in Conte Forum the pulsing wristbands give a holy aura to the concourse shrouded in darkness PERIOD This is big PERIOD The nerves swell to a level he has never felt before PERIOD Will he be able to do it Will the strenuous hours of work bear a fruitful performance He can feel his heartbeat quicken PERIOD But just like that the nervousness dissipates PERIOD As the harp sounds make their way to his ears Cheeseman finds peace PERIOD

When describing that night part of Cheeseman goes back to the moment PERIOD That sensation of nerves hopes and dreams flush over his face PERIOD He knows how much of a big deal it was PERIOD Last week he was just another musically gifted Boston College student PERIOD Now he has graduated in a sense though he is only a sophomore PERIOD Not many people get to sing with the worlds most famous pops orchestra PERIOD Many celebrities never share that stage let alone an undergrad from suburban New Jersey PERIOD

Cheeseman picked The Impossible Dream from Man of La Mancha for his song at the Pops because it reflected everything he was feeling after receiving this opportunity PERIOD Moreover that song represents something everyone at BC can appreciate because of its content about the downtrodden Don Quixote PERIOD

The song was important to Cheeseman because it was as he described such a relatable song to many of aspects of life PERIOD Its about someone achieving a dream that a lot of people keep telling him is impossible PERIOD

We are all here at this school trying to further our lives and reach the unreachable star he said PERIOD If there is one song that you got to sing on that stage it has got to be that song. for Cheeseman the notion of impossibility is an important one PERIOD Through a series of unlucky coincidences he thought his chances of winning the performance spot were slim to none PERIOD Cheeseman placed third in this years Sing it to the Heights competition singing a melange of Stay With Me by Sam Smith and Cold Water by Justin Bieber PERIOD This allowed him to skip the first round of auditions and go straight to the final callback for the Pops performance auditions PERIOD

But come that day Cheeseman grew ill PERIOD To make matters worse a friend who was supposed to play the piano accompaniment to his song Feed My Lambs by John Angotti didnt show up PERIOD With little time and with all the other call backs ready around him Cheeseman saw a dream slip away PERIOD Now desperate he tried to piece it together without him PERIOD Though he had played some piano before this was certainly a challenge PERIOD

I had to figure out the piano on my own he said PERIOD I did not practice for it PERIOD I thought I ruined it. but the unreachable star turned out to be a lot closer than Cheeseman thought PERIOD Sickness did not stop him neither did the hastily thrown together piano PERIOD Cheeseman was ecstatic upon winning the spot immediately calling his mother grandmother and friends telling them to clear their calendars for Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Everything else seemed to happen so fast PERIOD Over the summer Cheeseman worked extensively with vocal coach Dan Thaler brought up from New York City by BC to help Cheeseman prepare in New Jersey PERIOD Well into the first weeks of class the pair Skyped to maintain the practice routine PERIOD All the vocal exercises diaphragm relaxation and range work helped Cheeseman prepare physically for the big night but nothing could quite prepare him for the mental side he would experience in Conte PERIOD

He steps off stage after a thunderous applause PERIOD The first thought that crosses his mind is one of disbelief I cant believe I did that. its hard to peg the CSOM sophomore as the singing type PERIOD He is a member of The Bostonians a cappella group on campus PERIOD But Cheeseman is practical understanding that singing for him is really a side passion as he looks to the business school as a great way to pursue his interests in finance PERIOD But it is in a sense practicality through which he discovered his love for singing in the first place PERIOD

As a young kid Cheeseman frequently lost his voice PERIOD He had a problem projecting sound leading him to overexert it PERIOD Luckily his mother was a speech therapist PERIOD In an effort to further help him find and tame his voice she got him enrolled in voice lessons PERIOD

Any time he was in a social setting he would lose it his mother Linda explained PERIOD

Her profession allowed her to see the problemhe had bilateral vocal cord nodules benign white masses that formed from excessive stress on the cords PERIOD She began to help him using techniques that helped him control his breathing and projection even employing techniques used on patients with ALS PERIOD

With the help of his mother Cheeseman did find his voice and kept it but he also found something else among all the scales projecting and humsa passion for singing PERIOD Now the challenge became where he was going to project this newfound talent PERIOD

In the fourth grade at his K12 school at St PERIOD Josephs Regional High School was putting on a performance of High School Musical and Cheeseman wanted in PERIOD His mother knowing his tendencies feared the outcome PERIOD

I told him You dont sing you dont even have a voice she said PERIOD But Cheeseman was unfettered PERIOD

He got some sheet music went in and was a part of the show PERIOD But fate was not kind to this determined middle schooler PERIOD During his first show ever he again lost his voice PERIOD One of the onlookers of this sad sight was Raymond McLeod a Broadway performer best known for his portrayal of Simon Stride in Jekyll  Hyde was running voice workshops at St PERIOD Joes and saw that Cheeseman could really benefit PERIOD And so Cheeseman enrolled PERIOD

He kept going on with the lessons and other performances continuing to shape his voice delving into this new outlet for song in musical theatre PERIOD

But with this additional elements and practice came additional challenges namely getting passed up or passed over for parts that he desired PERIOD Thankfully for Cheeseman at around this same time in middle school he met musical director and another longtime mentor Ed Ginter PERIOD Ginter was integral in instilling a sense of strength in Cheeseman when not getting a desired part or outcome PERIOD When coping with losing a part Ginter made it clear that was just one persons opinion PERIOD

He always urged me to push through because there are so many opportunities Cheeseman said PERIOD

And the opportunities did come later at St PERIOD Joes PERIOD This time he turned his voice not out across a stage but to the sky PERIOD Cheeseman had sung at mass since middle school and was a member of his high school choir PERIOD But one day Ginter informed him of the need for a new church cantor and he jumped at the chance PERIOD The choir helped Cheeseman effectively blend and mesh his voice well with others but a solo cantor gig would give him more time to shape his own unique sound PERIOD

After landing the gig he put many of the most religiously devote to shame as he performed at up to six Masses every weekend something he still does when he is home for the summer PERIOD

Sometimes when I miss Mass on campus I make up for it throughout the whole summer he said PERIOD

He performed at many weddings and funerals which gave Cheeseman an edge in the performance realm as he felt the stakes were higher PERIOD With the higher stakes came higher pressure PERIOD He certainly did not want to disrespect the dead but he feared the wrath of the living PERIOD

There is nothing more nerve wracking than singing at a wedding thats being recorded he said PERIOD Because if you mess up the wife is going to be on you PERIOD She is going to call you she wont give you a paycheck. he was able to quell unruly nerves and find a way to center himself when it really mattered PERIOD Moreover he was getting paid to do something he loved as a freshman in high school PERIOD He could not ask for a better deal PERIOD

In a sense without his foundation in choir music and cantoring Cheeseman may never have got the Pops performance to start with PERIOD His audition song Feed My Lambs by John Angotti the one he thought he bombed was one of his favorite choir pieces PERIOD

Cheeseman considers Feed My Lambs one of his foundation songs and frequently goes back to it PERIOD But it surely became influential when he performed it for a spring concert one year in high school PERIOD Ginter told Cheeseman that he would have to perform the song a second time at the end of the show PERIOD Returning to the stage confused he performed it a second time PERIOD Harkening back to the idea of impossibility Ginter then enters the stage to welcome none other than Angotti himself PERIOD Angotti impressed with Cheesemans rendition invited the high schooler to perform the song with him at one of his concerts that weekend PERIOD

Sometimes the unreachable star reaches you first PERIOD Similar to the Pops audition small seemingly inconsequential performances can lead to bigger almost unimaginable results PERIOD

I did not think I would ever be able to hold my own with an orchestra like this to stand in front of a crowd like this Cheeseman said PERIOD

There are a lot of reasons to take the stagesome might say one is for recognition of talent PERIOD Cheeseman even before his performance however was getting a great deal of it PERIOD There was his face PERIOD Mark Crowley a professor in the BC accounting department had put his photo and biography next on the back of the note packet for that week PERIOD Thats a lot PERIOD But recognition is recognition PERIOD

People have nightmares about this where teachers single them out he said PERIOD If I was a freshman I would have crumbled on the inside PERIOD I thought it was hilarious PERIOD It was funny it was a great thing but its nice to get recognized for music here. but recognition is not the thing that fuels Cheeseman the most PERIOD He wants to give back PERIOD But he doesnt have to look far to get inspired PERIOD His grandmother has always pushed his goals and given when others needed help PERIOD

When my family couldnt afford certain programs she would support us financially he said PERIOD

Within Cheesemans nuclear family his grandmother also gives to numerous charities for cancer and Type I diabetes which afflicts his two uncles PERIOD

We always say she will never have a penny in her bank account by the time she dies because she will give it all away Cheeseman added PERIOD

During his trials with losing his voice she was there for him and helped work through the emotional trauma of losing a key part of himself PERIOD Moreover she has never missed a show and is certainly his biggest fan PERIOD

Because of her giving nature the principle of giving is something Cheeseman tries to emulate to the best of his abilities especially in his music that he holds dear PERIOD This is also why there was so much thought put into picking The Impossible Dream as he hoped to give and convey a cherished message to as many people possible PERIOD

I want to reflect that PERIOD I dont have the money to give yet PERIOD I dont have everything PERIOD I dont have time because I am a college student he said PERIOD But I do have music. and with respect to his grandmother he is already trying to pay it back PERIOD During this last spring his grandmother had a surgery on her back and was stuck at home PERIOD Being cooped up in a house on a spring day was not acceptable for Cheeseman PERIOD He wanted to cheer her up but was unsure just how PERIOD But then again he did have music PERIOD

In a beautiful display of love Cheeseman rallied his fellow Bostonian members and went to her home and sangjust for her PERIOD Something that touched her heart dearly and gave her a reason to smile PERIOD Her grandson got college students up bright and early to sing for her PERIOD

I dont think anyone realized the magnitude of it Linda said PERIOD I didnt realize it because he played it off like it was no big deal PERIOD He has always been very casual. and Cheeseman does give off the vibe of being casual PERIOD When speaking about achieving and making progress the emphasis was never put on a single moment though some were big and others were wildly influential PERIOD The process and progression were more important PERIOD He has natural talent but everything that he has achieved he has had to work hard for PERIOD Nothing has ever been easy for him PERIOD But it seems nothing will stop him PERIOD

For the time being he goes about his day PERIOD Though in his next class he might not be on the back of a note packet and in the coming weekend he may be found watching a game in the periphery of Conte rather than in the center of it before  people but that would be enough for him PERIOD

In the future Cheeseman hopes to find a career that marries his two passions for business and music PERIOD Such a career would bring the security that he strives for but also joy and fulfillment PERIOD Such aspirations may seem like a longshot for some but for Cheeseman every dream seems like a possible dream when tackled with equal parts dedication and passion PERIOD
