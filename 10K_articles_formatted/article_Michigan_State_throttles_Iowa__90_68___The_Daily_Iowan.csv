7082,2021-03-13,"points were hard to come by for Iowa as the Hawkeyes started the second half shooting just 1for20 from the field PERIOD

Iowa forward Tyler Cook dribbles down the baseline during Iowas game against Wisconsin at CarverHawkeye Arena on November   PERIOD The Hawkeyes were defeated by the Badgers  PERIOD

Adam Hensley Pregame Editor December  

No PERIOD  Iowa dominated in the post earlier this season but on Monday it was the polar opposite  No PERIOD  Michigan State had its way in the paint during its  win over Iowa in East Lansing Michigan  the Spartans twenty-third win by at least  points in the past  seasons PERIOD

The Spartans cruised to a 22point victory thanks to a night in which they shot . percent from the field PERIOD Most of Michigan States damage came down low from Nick Ward who cooked Iowa in the paint PERIOD The junior forward scored a gamehigh  points made all  of his field goal attempts and grabbed  rebounds to pace the Spartans PERIOD

Fellow big man Kenny Goins flirted with a tripledouble scoring  points grabbing  rebounds and dishing  assists PERIOD

Ive always been impressed with Goins Iowa head coach Fran McCaffery said PERIOD I think a better indicator of everybody is what Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo thinks of them PERIOD Tom has always played him trusts him The guys a winner. tyler Cook scored a teamhigh  points to lead the Hawkeyes offensive charge but the Black and Gold battled foul trouble all night in front of a raucous Breslin Center crowd PERIOD Iowa committed  fouls and Michigan State capitalized making  of its  free throws PERIOD The Hawkeyes missed  of their  attempts from the stripe but the Hawkeyes biggest issue heading into a matchup with Iowa State lies in Joe Wieskamps health PERIOD

The freshman guard rolled his ankle in the second half and unable to put much of his weight on his foot he was helped off the court PERIOD

According to head coach Fran McCaffery the Muscatine native will be a gametime decision for Thursdays CyHawk contest PERIOD

But Wieskamps injury wasnt the deciding factor in the loss PERIOD Much like how Iowa struggled to hit shots down the stretch of its  loss against No PERIOD  Wisconsin on Nov PERIOD  the Hawkeyes scoring well ran bonedry in the second half PERIOD Iowa missed all but one of its first  field goals of the second half PERIOD

Pretty much everything went wrong after half McCaffery said PERIOD We didnt get anything going offensively PERIOD They did PERIOD It was their ball to start they got some good offensive possessions and we had a couple turnovers. meanwhile Iowa failed to get any production from its post players PERIOD Luka Garza failed to score until there were  remaining in the game PERIOD He finished with  points on an abysmal 1of10 shooting and a teamhigh  rebounds PERIOD

Jordan Bohannon got things going early from behind the 3point arc but he finished 4for12 from the field scoring  points PERIOD Isaiah Moss was the secondhighest scorer on the team netting  PERIOD

And while Iowas offense struggled to find any sort of consistency Michigan States ball movement carved up the Hawkeye defense all game long PERIOD The Spartans assisted on  of their  made shots for those nonmathematicians Michigan State assisted on  percent of its field goal attempts PERIOD

Now the Hawkeyes turn their attention to instate rival Iowa State PERIOD The Cyclones travel to Carver for a  p.m PERIOD showdown in the off PERIOD
