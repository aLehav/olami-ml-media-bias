3726,2015-04-09,"at least for a moment Spencer Powers BC  was in an unfamiliar situation PERIOD

Powers returned to the Boston College campus on Tuesday night to speak with students in the BC Venture Competition club as well as the participants of its social entrepreneurship seed competition PERIOD At the front of a room in Fulton Hall Powers gave feedback on student proposals and shared his own thoughts to those interested in serviceoriented business ventures PERIOD

Powers is the 30yearold cofounder of ArtLifting an online marketplace that sells artwork from homeless and disabled individuals in therapeutic programs PERIOD He had no prior entrepreneurship experience as a BC student but his passion for service drove him to help create his own startup PERIOD A graduate of BC High and BC Powers has taken many of the Universitys values to heart and works to incorporate them on a daily basis while managing his new company in Boston PERIOD

The mission of the Jesuits has always resonated with me Powers said PERIOD It has always been a part of our family and my daily life. powers and his sister Liz cofounded the lowprofit limited liability company in Dec PERIOD  and the venture has quickly grown to support  artists in seven major U.S PERIOD cities across the country PERIOD Before the idea took off Liz Powers wanted to make an impact through her work PERIOD After graduating from Harvard and completing a senior thesis on the benefits of art therapy Liz decided to work at homeless and disabled shelters for eight years and developed close relationships with the program directors and artists PERIOD She created and ran art groups in womens shelters in Boston and was amazed by the talent she encountered PERIOD As a social worker and artist herself Liz combined the two interests and created City Heart an annual art show that brought together eight homeless shelters in the city PERIOD Spencer Powers joined his sister by coordinating some of the business logistics of the event PERIOD

We started working together on the annual art show and it became clear that these groups of people need to continue to share their work not just on one day but yearround Powers said PERIOD

In May  the brothersister duo set out to build something bigger a program that would eventually help many more homeless and disabled individuals not only in the city but across the country PERIOD Throughout the summer they set out to make their idea a reality PERIOD The goal was to build a business that would have a strong social mission but also be financially sustainable and not need to rely on outside donations to operate PERIOD

By September a plan was in motion PERIOD The siblings met at a pub in Harvard Square to go over the business model and immediately began working to create ArtLifting PERIOD Liz contacted local artists at therapeutic centers to obtain their paintings and put images of their works online PERIOD Spencer began building the website and some of the smaller tasks of creating a companylike filing for legal status PERIOD Shortly after Thanksgiving the website launched with a total of four artists collaborating in the venture PERIOD

When we launched we thought people would find us online and explore our artwork and buy it Powers said PERIOD One thing we quickly found out was that it is really hard to get people to realize you exist online. with a significant amount of competition from other artwork sites online ArtLifting initially struggled to get exposure PERIOD After the Boston Globe ran an article about the startup however many people visited the website and began taking an interest in the artwork PERIOD By the end of their first month live the four artists sold a total of  worth of artwork PERIOD Additionally three marginalized artists made over  in that first monthproviding enough personal income for some to fund their own homes PERIOD

In recent years art has become an increasingly popular method of therapy particularly for those facing economic or physical hardships PERIOD Many therapeutic initiatives are instituted at homeless shelters and disability programs as an opportunity for these individuals to share their artwork and potentially earn an income PERIOD

There are a lot of people who suffer from disadvantages who have the opportunity to create beautiful artwork Powers said PERIOD The purpose of creating the artwork is for the therapy PERIOD It is peaceful PERIOD It is creative PERIOD It is tangible. after the startups successful first month a number of homeless and disability shelters found out about ArtLifting online and reached out to the Powers siblings PERIOD Miami was the first city outside of Boston that partnered with ArtLifting and a number of others followed including New Jersey New York City San Francisco Los Angeles and Austin PERIOD

While the company was growing the team worked out of Lizs apartment or wherever they could find space PERIOD In the spring of  ArtLifting was accepted to the prestigious startup accelerator MassChallenge which provided free office space PERIOD Currently ArtLifting is splitting time between MassChallenge and Harvards Launch Lab and the team is not sure where it will be headquartered in the next few months PERIOD

Were very fortunate there is a kind of entrepreneurial ecosystem built for young startups and that makes it easy to work from anywhere Powers said PERIOD

Looking to the future Powers wants ArtLifting to become the goto online marketplace for art PERIOD The company has grown tenfold in just one year and aims to continue to expand globally and help an increased number of artists earn their own income PERIOD Powers is currently working parttime on ArtLifting while he dedicates his days as a Management student at MIT but he spends much of his spare time investigating licensing opportunities for artwork and reaching out to large brands and corporations selling products that could be decorated with artwork from ArtLifting PERIOD

While art therapy doesnt exist solely for artists to sell their work having that opportunity can help people Powers said PERIOD Companies like Toms Shoes have grown to be very successful while also embracing a social mission and we would love to become that for art. featured Images Courtesy of ArtLifting
