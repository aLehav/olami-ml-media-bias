The discussion  hosted by The Frost Foundation Lectureship for Global Issues and the Center for International Studies TCU Abroad  focused on the aftermath of the genocide and what the TCU community could take away from the lawyers experiences PERIOD

What we saw in Rwanda was it was not about the individual  it was a collective Prosper said PERIOD And they gathered strength among themselves and were able to create a movement and able to push and promote change which was critical. the slaughter of the Tutsi left emotional scars that proved far more devastating than physical scars Darehshori said PERIOD

Between  and  women were raped during the genocide according to the UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict PERIOD In some cases men with a known HIV positive status raped women with the purpose of infecting them PERIOD

Rape has been a war crime since  but until the genocide in Rwanda it was never prosecuted PERIOD

For the longest time rape and sexual violence was viewed as a lesser crime Prosper said PERIOD

Darehshori added It was classified as theft in the fourth category of crimes. in  the attorneys won the first conviction of rape as a war crime against JeanPaul Akayesu a former Rwandan mayor PERIOD

In addition to the  million people killed in the genocide Prosper said another  million fled the country PERIOD TCU student Pacifique Rutamu was among the many children to lose family in the violence PERIOD

Growing up in Rwanda without one or two parents was an issue shared by many kids so it wasnt like I felt alone in this sadness said Rutamu whose father was killed in the genocide PERIOD

Rutamu also spoke of the lessons he learned from living through the genocide PERIOD

It becomes your engine to function and do well and make sure you dont waste your time where you are  to grab every single opportunity you have he said PERIOD And make sure you contribute to not having genocide happen again in your own country.",Rwanda genocide panel highlights changing stigma of rape | TCU 360,Texas Christian University
