Really Worth Traveling

Reviewed by Tim Wright

Are you craving a fried deli sandwich that includes french fries and cole slaw

Do you happen to be interested in seeing three rivers meet at a single point

Architecture enthusiasts would you enjoy checking out two relatively new stadiums and a stateoftheart convention center

If you happened to answer yes to any of the above questions you may be hankering for one of the most enjoyable albeit unusual road trip spots in the immediate vicinity of State College Pittsburgh PERIOD

A city with a murky if not altogether bleak past  due to its beginnings as steel mill central  Pittsburgh has eased its way into the new millennium making changes both subtle and evident at the same time PERIOD The major changes  the addition of PNC Park home of the Pirates baseball team and Heinz Field home of the Steelers  have outweighed the smaller ones in terms of hype but not improvement PERIOD Additionally the new David L PERIOD Lawrence Convention Center has become a major hub for the city bringing in several limited events each year PERIOD And the city itself has cleaned up brandishing its new image as a cleaner more hospitable town than days of yore PERIOD

But enough about the talk of the citys improvements  what I really should be telling people about this road trip is the many unique experiences that you can have when youre in the city of Pittsburgh PERIOD Not only do you get the chance to hear some of the most bizarre accents in the history of the English language but you also find out what its like to go dahn er to Primanti Brothers nat and get yourself a jumbo PERIOD If you have no idea what I just said dont fret answers are coming.Basically what I said was when in town you can go to the famous Primanti Bros PERIOD Restaurant  known for sandwiches stacked high with what are traditionally side orders  and taste the biggest sandwich in the metro area PERIOD With five locations in the city its hard to miss the oneofakind Primantis PERIOD

Pittsburgh is not without its landmarks either the most popular being Point State Park located right at the spot where the Allegheny Monongahela and Ohio rivers meet downtown PERIOD Known primarily for its famed fountain at the tip Point State Park is an excellent spot to take a load off after eating all that Primantis.If youre more of a sporting event kind of person there are those two new stadiums that I referred to earlier PERIOD Since its almost spring the Pirates will be starting up a new season soon and theres no better deal in town than paying  for a seat at the home of the  AllStar Game PNC Park PERIOD

But while youre in town the most important thing that youll want to do is check out the many diverse areas around the city PERIOD More towards the north side of the city you have the Strip District wellknown to Pittsburghers for its array of Italian supermarkets eateries bakeries and just your basic art shops and bars PERIOD More partyprone travelers will want to check out the South Side of the city notably East Carson Street almost similar to State College because of its endless assortment of local watering holes PERIOD And if youre really missing the Penn State atmosphere while youre there just head into Oakland and party with fellow college students from the University of Pittsburgh PERIOD

Should you decide to embark on the above road trip I am guaranteeing that you will have an altogether rewarding time  yes even you people out there from Philly PERIOD Pittsburgh has not only been my home for the past  years but it has also been the place where Ive learned to appreciate all the best parts of city life PERIOD You dont have to call it home but its definitely worth a visit PERIOD
