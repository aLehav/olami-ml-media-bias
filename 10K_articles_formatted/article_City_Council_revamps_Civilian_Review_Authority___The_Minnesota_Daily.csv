4998,2023-11-04,"the change comes after several complaints of the board being ineffective and its rulings unjustified PERIOD

by  Koran AddoPublished  November  

University student William Pedersen knows firsthand that police brutality complaints did not get far with the Civilian Review Authoritys old structure PERIOD

Last fall Pedersen filed a claim with the CRA saying a police officer kicked and slapped him outside a friends house PERIOD

Pedersen said he tried unsuccessfully for four weeks to contact the CRA investigator in charge of his case PERIOD He then worked abroad for four months and when he returned the CRA had not made progress with his case PERIOD

When I came back the CRA told me that they werent active anymore Pedersen said PERIOD

But now Minneapolis City Council members and action groups hope a new board new structure and new rules will make the CRA an effective check on how police treat people PERIOD

After complaints from council and community members the City Council passed an ordinance last March restructuring the group PERIOD The CRA will begin hearing cases Monday PERIOD

Minneapolis officials created the sevenmember CRA in  to hear police brutality allegations PERIOD But budget cuts in early  crippled the groups investigative abilities PERIOD The CRA has not heard a case in almost two years PERIOD

The general sentiment in the public was that the CRA was ineffective CRA board Chairman Michael Friedman said PERIOD The city was over budget and they didnt think the results were justified. under the new structure three board members will hear each case and decide whether to sustain a case  essentially determining if the claim is valid PERIOD Previously the CRA executive director looked at each case first to determine whether there was enough evidence for the entire board to hear it PERIOD

If the CRA sustains a complaint the board passes it on to the police chief who has discretion on whether to discipline the officer or officers involved PERIOD

If the police chief decides not to discipline an officer after the CRA finds them to be at fault the chief is obligated to write an explanation to the CRA and the mayors office PERIOD

CRA manager Barbara DamchikDykes said the burden of proof in determining whether cases will be sustained has also changed from clear and convincing to more likely than not. clear and convincing evidence meant about  percent which is a tough standard to meet she said PERIOD

Friedman said because the process is clearer for citizens the new structure will allow for better communication with the community PERIOD Also because people filing complaints can now attend the hearings Friedman said they will be more involved with the process PERIOD

Before a complainant had no role in the hearing Friedman said PERIOD It made people feel like nothing was happening. some community members however were unconvinced the changes will yield an effective process PERIOD

The CRA has never been worth anything since it was created in Minneapolis said Bill Cooley a member of Communities United Against Police Brutality an advocacy group for people abused by police PERIOD

Cooley said that before the restructuring his group did not recommend that people take complaints to the CRA PERIOD He said he is hopeful  but skeptical  that the reforms will result in positive changes PERIOD

We have enough faith in some of the members of the new board of the CRA but were not sure if there going to be able to make it Cooley said PERIOD

Minneapolis police officer Ron Reier said the police also have some concerns about the CRA although they recognize its necessity PERIOD

There will always be an adversarial relationship Reier said PERIOD We would like to think that we are a professional organization with high standards but we are humans and there needs to be checks and balances. reier said he is concerned about the CRA investigating every claim because there is no investigation into the person making the claim PERIOD

What about the person who makes the complaint what happens if it turns out they were incorrect Reier said PERIOD Thats where there are no checks and balances. but Pedersen said a separation from the police is necessary if the CRA is to be an effective advocate for the public PERIOD

If the CRA is going to work they need people who arent afraid of the police  community members who care and arent affected by political power Pedersen said PERIOD

Minneapolis City Council member Paul Zerby second Ward who is on the Health and Human Services Committee that drafted the ordinance changing the CRA said he also had doubts about the new structure PERIOD Zerby who represents the University area said the changes fell short of his expectations and he hopes the council will monitor the CRAs effectiveness PERIOD

I was quite disappointed with the way this was structured Zerby said PERIOD What I wanted to do was treat it as a forum in which a complainant could actually have a little trialtype hearing where they would be able to sit in while the officer testified. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
