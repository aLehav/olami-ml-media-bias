2841,2011-04-10,"infielder Shannel Blackshear stepped up to the plate in the bottom of the second inning with the Badgers trailing  early on against Northwestern in the first game of a doubleheader Saturday PERIOD The sophomore battled with Wildcat pitcher Jessica Smith fouling off ball after ball to stay alive and the persistence paid off PERIOD

On the sixteenth pitch of the atbat Blackshear connected on her seventh home run of the year to make the score  PERIOD

Honestly I was just trying to foul pitches off and I was doing my best not to let the umpire take control of my atbat Blackshear said PERIOD Anything close I was going to try and hit it just to stay in that atbat and change things for my team. blackshears home run was the first hit of the game for the Badgers and it was also the turning point setting the tone for the rest of the game PERIOD

Everyone turned to smiles and everyone thought weve actually got a shot here head coach Yvette Healy said PERIOD

Blackshears next atbat went nine pitches  total in backtoback atbats exemplifying a patience that is unparalleled by most young power hitters PERIOD

This year Ive been struggling with swinging at pitches that arent good versus the ones that are Blackshear said PERIOD Ive been working really hard to adjust and change that to help my team out. blackshear came through again in the bottom of the sixth inning PERIOD With bases loaded the sophomore hit a tworun single up the middle to make the score  PERIOD The Badgers rallied and loaded the bases once more in the inning setting the stage for pinch hitter Dana Rasmussen PERIOD

The first thing Coach Snyder said to me as I went on the field was Youre from Madison you can do this Rasmussen said PERIOD That lit a spark in me. with one swing of the bat Rasmussen hit a triple her first of the season to drive in three runs and tie the game PERIOD

Shell never forget that hit Healy said PERIOD Shell be telling her kids about that one. rasmussen was hitless in her previous five games but that didnt stop Healy and the coaching staff from having the utmost confidence in the senior with the game on line PERIOD

Shes a kid who does it in practice Healy said PERIOD We did batting practice the other day and she was putting balls over the fence so were proud of her to be able to put it together in a game. with Rasmussen still on third base in the bottom of the sixth inning the Badgers werent done PERIOD It was senior Jordan Wheelers turn to contribute as she laid down a bunt to reach first base and more importantly sent home Rasmussen to take the lead  PERIOD

Coming behind Rasmussen Jordan was on deck and I said Put a bunt down here and youre going to have the gamewinning RBI Healy said PERIOD She was able to do that too so thats really fun to see kids coming off the bench do those types of things to win a game. krueger goes cold

Wisconsin experienced dj vu as it trailed for much of the second game of the doubleheader PERIOD However the Badgers luck ran dry as they were unable to string together another lategame rally losing  PERIOD

Senior outfielder Jennifer Krueger struggled mightily in both games uncharacteristically going hitless 0for7 PERIOD Her presence was especially missed in the Badgers second game as they couldnt manufacture a single run and produced merely three hits PERIOD

Thats rare for that to happen Healy said PERIOD Shes a great kid and were going to go back to the drawing board and see what kind of adjustments we can make to get her back on track. this article was published Apr   at  pm and last
