Eamonn Daniel Higgins  a resident of Laguna Niguel was arrested last week on charges of operating a ring of illegal testtakers who allegedly assisted international students in retaining their student visas by taking their proficiency exams and attending their classes PERIOD

For the last eight years prosecutors said Higgins aided mostly Middle Eastern students by taking or directing his associates to take math and English proficiency exams PERIOD Higgins then helped them hold on to those visas by taking college courses passing finals and writing term papers in their names PERIOD According to court reports the investigation began when officers in Daly City in Northern California discovered several fake drivers licenses in a lost wallet PERIOD Each license had the same photograph of Higgins nephew but with different names PERIOD

Higgins surrendered to authorities March  pleading not guilty to conspiracy to commit visa fraud PERIOD If convicted he faces up to five years in federal prison PERIOD

The F1 student visa is a nonimmigrant visa which allows foreign students to enter into the U.S PERIOD to attend a full course of study at colleges universities and other institutions with language training programs PERIOD Although it is unclear if there is a specific proficiency exam that international students need to take in order to qualify for an F1 visa many institutions including Cal State Fullerton require all applicants whose native language is not English to present scores for the Test of English as a Foreign Language TOEFL prior to admittance PERIOD

According to CSUFs international students webpage Students who do not meet the minimum TOEFL scores or wish to improve their English skills may enroll in the American Language Program ALP an intensive English program that is designed to prepare international students for study in a U.S PERIOD college or university PERIOD

Monica Snow lecturer and coordinator at the ALP at CSUF said that there are stringent measures taken at the center to ensure that cheating or impersonating does not occur in any form while students take any placement or proficiency tests PERIOD All international students who walk in to take any tests are required to present their I.D.s after which their faces are matched to the picture on the card PERIOD While taking the tests students have to leave their I.D.s on their desks while proctors circulate the room PERIOD Faces are again matched to I.D.s when students turn in their tests once they are finished Snow said PERIOD

With the measures we have in place here it could be very difficult for students to do that PERIOD I have been here  years and I havent had one incident yet Snow said PERIOD Snow added that there are around  international students at CSUF who are enrolled in the ALP PERIOD The administrators and staff for the most part know the majority of the students as they interact with them on a daily basis PERIOD

The University Testing Center at CSUF located in University hall offers several tests such as the English Placement Test EPT Entry Level Mathematics ELM test and the Examination in Writing Proficiency EWP all of which are required for admission to the university placement in classes and graduation PERIOD

Lorrie Harnach coordinator at the testing center said that students who take any tests are required to present a valid form of I.D. such as a drivers license or passport PERIOD Seating is sometimes assigned and proctors should be able to move freely among examinees in order to effectively monitor testing PERIOD After tests are taken I.D.s and faces are matched again and names are compared to the ones on the answer sheets PERIOD Student signatures on answer sheets are also matched with the one on the students I.D PERIOD

Although no such incident has occurred at the center to her knowledge Harnach said that the possibility of students cheating or impersonating others cannot be ruled out PERIOD If a student presented what appeared to be a valid form of I.D PERIOD where the picture matched the person we would not have any way of knowing if it was fraudulent or not she said PERIOD

LayTuan Tan director of International Education and Exchange at CSUF said that all international students at CSUF are part of the Exchange Visitor Program that is regulated and operated by the U.S PERIOD Department of State PERIOD Tan said that at CSUF all students with foreign visas are required to maintain continuous enrollment and have to report within ten days of a change in address or within  days of dropping a class PERIOD

According to the U.S PERIOD Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE Web site Congress mandated a feebased system to better keep track of international students and exchange visitors in the United States PERIOD To accomplish this task the Department of Homeland Security DHS established the Student Exchange Visitor Program SEVP under ICE PERIOD The Student Exchange and Visitor Information System SEVIS is the database that allows SEVP to track international students exchange visitors and their dependents to ensure that they are in the United States for the purposes they stated PERIOD

This is bad news for the international education field Tan said of the visa fraud incident PERIOD The Majority of our scholars are serious bona fide students who come here for the quality of education that the U.S PERIOD provides PERIOD These things do happen but they give our international students a bad name Tan said PERIOD

Although Tan said that the implications of this incident could be huge and highly complicated she added it was unfortunate that most media organizations were alluding to hints of possible terrorist ties within the fraud ring PERIOD Just because these students are from the Middle East they say they might be terrorists PERIOD You cannot say that it is stereotyping Tan said PERIOD
