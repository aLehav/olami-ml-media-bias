MARCY N.Y PERIOD  Lynette Squeaky Fromme the Charles Manson follower convicted in  of pointing a gun at thenPresident Gerald Ford is moving to upstate New York local officials said Tuesday PERIOD

Oneida County Undersheriff Peter Paravati and state police spokesman Lt PERIOD Glenn Miner said federal authorities notified their offices about Fromme moving into the area PERIOD

District Attorney Scott McNamara said he was notified by state police that the 60yearold Fromme was moving to Marcy following her release last month after serving  years in federal prison PERIOD

If she has arrived nobodys heard from her PERIOD Nobody has seen her PERIOD Nobodys made a fuss McNamara said PERIOD

Paravati and McNamara said they were given no other information about Frommes move PERIOD

I thought it was a joke at first said the prosecutor who added that federal authorities routinely notify local law enforcement agencies when federal parolees convicted of drug sex or violent crimes relocate to a community PERIOD

Obviously it creates a concern because of the crimes she was convicted of committing McNamara said PERIOD But as far as us treating her any differently than anyone else shes paid her debt to society. fromme eluded the media last month as she left the Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth Texas PERIOD She declined a recent interview request from The Associated Press PERIOD Officials did not know of her whereabouts Tuesday PERIOD

Prison officials would not say where she planned to live or what she planned to do after more than  years behind bars PERIOD Some of Frommes relatives still live in her home state of California PERIOD

U.S PERIOD Parole Commission spokesman Tom Hutchison noted again Tuesday that he could not discuss Frommes plans PERIOD Fromme will be on supervised release for two years and must report regularly to a parole officer he said PERIOD

In September  Fromme pushed through a crowd drew a semiautomatic .45caliber pistol from a thigh holster and pointed it at Ford who was shaking hands with wellwishers at the California State Capitol in Sacramento PERIOD Secret Service agents grabbed her and the gun PERIOD Ford wasnt hurt PERIOD

Fromme was a college student before joining Mansons family where she reportedly got her nickname because of her voice PERIOD She was never implicated in the  murders of actress Sharon Tate and eight others for which Manson is serving a life term in Corcoran State Prison in California PERIOD

The news that Fromme already is or soon could be a neighbor came as a surprise to local residents and officials PERIOD

Town Supervisor Brian Scala said he had not been given any information and had no comment PERIOD

Im surprised but not alarmed said Raymond Maciewicz  of Marcy PERIOD Its an awful long time ago PERIOD Maybe shes repented her ways. the town of Marcy is  miles east of Syracuse and includes four hamlets spread over  square miles with about  people PERIOD Although mostly rural the town is home to two mediumsecurity state prisons the county jail and the State University of New York Institute of Technology PERIOD
