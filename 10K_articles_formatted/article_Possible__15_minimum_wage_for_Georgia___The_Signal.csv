8819,2015-01-19,"after states such as Washington Arkansas and Alaska approved higher wages for minimumwage employees eligible Georgia residents may also experience an increase in their paychecks after this legislative season PERIOD

House Bill  HB  proposed to raise Georgias minimumwage from an averaged . per hour to  was introduced on Jan PERIOD  and is being examined by the Georgia House of Representatives PERIOD

The bill intends to provide a higher minimum wage for eligible Georgia workers according to the Georgia General Assemblys webpage PERIOD If approved the bill would go into effect on Jan PERIOD   PERIOD

Including the initial minimum wage increase the bill also aims to annually increase the minimum wage comparable costs of living PERIOD Each year the Georgia Department of Labor would be required to measure the percentage increase in the cost of living and calculate an adjusted minimum wage for the next year according to the Georgia General Assemblys website PERIOD

One of the HB8s four sponsors Representative Dewey McClain said he hopes the bill will help working men and women attain a better standard of living PERIOD

There has not been a wage increase since  and . an hour is  a year  an hour you are still borderline poverty because youre making  a year McClain said PERIOD My accomplishment is trying to get working men and women out of poverty PERIOD You work all day but youre still in poverty he said PERIOD

McClain also said the bill would benefit employers as well as employees PERIOD

If the employers are participating in this program it helps them by not having to retrain employees to take someones place PERIOD Instead of an employee getting up every morning looking for work  looking for better work  he or she will stay with an employer longer he said PERIOD



How businesses would be affected

Jeff Steinbuck owner of Walters Clothing said he felt higher wages wouldnt necessarily guarantee higher employee loyalty PERIOD

If its  an hour versus  an hour it really doesnt matter PERIOD Its immaterial as long as everyone is getting paid the same wage he said PERIOD

Steinbuck also said he felt it might be hard for many businesses to adjust to a possible wage increase PERIOD

If it raises to  an hour I think that would be pretty hard for a lot of businesses to absorb that kind of increase he said PERIOD

Currently more than  percent of workers are covered under the federal minimum wage leaving only  percent not provided for according to Georgia State professor Bruce Kaufman PERIOD

However Georgias current minimum wage . an hour is almost irrelevant as few employers offer such a low wage in the modern labor market according to Kaufman PERIOD

Kaufman said an increase in the minimum wage would be helpful to those in need on the lower end of the job spectrum PERIOD

The demandsupply situation in the low end of Georgia labor markets is pretty unbalanced because there are so many more job seekers than there are job openings PERIOD Thus people cant get a decent wage to live on and many also dont get benefits he said PERIOD  A rise in the minimum wage is a useful way to give these people a raise when excess labor supply makes it impossible for them to get it on their own. kaufman also said raising the minimum wage might not have a severe impact on businesses and the overall economy PERIOD

Evidence indicates a moderate increase in the minimum wage typically has a pretty small job loss effect partly because firms raise prices to offset the labor cost increase and partly because they find offsetting economies elsewhere in their operations. an increase in Georgias minimum wage legislation would not be uncalled for nor the first of its kind according to Kaufman PERIOD

Of course the benefits and costs change as you talk about an  vs PERIOD  vs PERIOD  minimum wage PERIOD Currently the Georgia minimum wage is one of the lowest in the  states so giving it a hike is hardly radical PERIOD Note for example that people in four relatively conservative states voted last November to raise their state minimum wage he said PERIOD

However Kaufman also said he felt HB8s proposed  an hour would be too great an increase and suggested raising the wages in increments PERIOD

It needs to be done in increments so business firms can have more time to adjust Kaufman said PERIOD

How working students would be affected

Georgia State student Hillary Austin said she believes HB8 would be a lifechanging legislative move PERIOD

I think that if this bill goes through it could change peoples lives PERIOD I cant believe something like this hasnt been brought up already honestly PERIOD As the cost of living goes up then so should minimum wage she said PERIOD I could tell you how many people I know that have to work two or more jobs just to feed themselves and afford the basic essentials but that would be an outrageously long list. austin also said the bill could help students who are working to pay for tuition PERIOD

For students who are taking a lot of credit hours I think the increase would help limit how many hours they had to work during the school week which could possibly improve their grades  it would give them more money to handle the costs of being full time students she said PERIOD

Neuroscience major Stephen Green said he felt raising minimum wage might be helpful but it could also have negative impacts PERIOD

Maybe this would be a good step but Im not sure how you could raise the minimum wage and not keep everything else from inflating along with everything else PERIOD At this point there should be something done to help relieve stress on lower income families and even provide some minor luxuries he said PERIOD

Green also said raising the minimum wage could give smaller consumers more money to spend on regular goods in the economy PERIOD

I think overall it would be good getting money into small consumers hands  not people who buy yachts or Lamborghinis but people who buy basic supplies  because they tend to spend out of necessity PERIOD So if they have more money in their hands theyre going to be required to spend it anyway he said PERIOD

Amanda OKelley a Georgia State student said increasing the minimum wage to  might be unfair to those already working for higher wages PERIOD

I wouldnt be totally against it but I dont see why you would want it to be  because then I feel like that would mean everyone else who is getting paid  now for their job and might have a degree of some sort would need to be paid more too and everything will have to increase she said PERIOD

OKelley also said she felt the bill could help working Georgia State students trying to afford living in the city PERIOD

I do know that it costs a little more to live in the city so that may be a good thing for students who may have more money  they could put extra money toward school or the supplies for school she said PERIOD

I want to know what we the people of Georgia can do PERIOD I know we can help in some way to get this bill approved

This bill will bring everyone making over minimum wage down to the poverty level and they worked hard to get there PERIOD Are high school students going to make  dollars to buss tables and wash dishes PERIOD This is nuts PERIOD Every time minimum wage is increased it makes inflation go up for example you go and pull in the drivethrough and your value meal cost . and at the grocery store a gallon of milk is . pERIOD What did you gain
