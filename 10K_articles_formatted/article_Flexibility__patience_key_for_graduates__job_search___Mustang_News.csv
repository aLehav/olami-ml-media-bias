Theres one thing Cal Poly graduates will want to keep in mind while hunting for their dream job this summer be flexible PERIOD Chances are you wont find one right away PERIOD

In the midst of a harsh job market Cal Poly career counselor Carole Moore advises students to match their skills with industries that are flourishing now instead of forcing the issue in an industry that theyve had their hearts set on PERIOD

This isnt a doom and gloom situation Moore said PERIOD There are still needs out there its just a time when you need to be more flexible. although some job markets are bogged down and have little work available there are others that are having trouble filling positions PERIOD According to CNBCs list of the  hardest jobs to fill in the United States engineering positions rank No PERIOD  PERIOD That bodes well for Cal Polys staple major engineering which accounts for more than a quarter of Cal Polys student population PERIOD

Other industries that have been less impacted by the failing economy include healthcare nonprofit organizations federal government and green industries PERIOD Accounting and finance positions are also widely available due to lack of students majoring in this field according to CNBC PERIOD

Whatever industries graduating Cal Poly students plan on heading into if they havent already secured jobs in them they need to be aware that jobs are limited and companies are hiring at a slower pace than usual PERIOD This means that students need to cast a wider net and take opportunities seriously Moore advised PERIOD

On the Cal Poly campus career fairs and recruitments have seen a dramatic decrease of activity PERIOD This school year there were  employers recruiting on campus which is a dramatic drop from the  visiting a year before PERIOD The Job Fair that Cal Poly hosts during the winter quarter has taken an even bigger hit from  employers on campus in  to only  in  PERIOD

Students are going to have to be much more organized and much more aggressive when they enter the job market now Moore said PERIOD Be prepared PERIOD Know everything about the company that you are interviewing for everything. for students searching for jobs Moore recommends using Web sites like indeed.com dice.com and idealist.org where you will find more of the nonprofit opportunities PERIOD However using the Mustang Jobs link on My Cal Poly Portal is probably the most efficient tactic because employers are specifically looking for Cal Poly students PERIOD

Mustang Jobs is really useful because jobs are searching for you Moore explained PERIOD Whereas on other sites youre searching for the job. as far as dressing for an interview applicants want to look professional and conservative PERIOD While professional and conservative are terms left to a variety of interpretations Moore defined it as slacks and a buttondown shirt PERIOD

According to Moore the most important thing to establish right now is a strong networking base PERIOD Networking with teachers students and previous employers is a good way to get notified of job openings and can often get applicants interviews because of someones recommendation PERIOD

I like to celebrate every little step Moore said PERIOD If a student gets an interview or if they get a second interview those are things to be proud of because they are steps that lead to getting a job. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
