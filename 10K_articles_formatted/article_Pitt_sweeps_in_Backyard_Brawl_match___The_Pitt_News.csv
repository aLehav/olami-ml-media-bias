Pitt volleyball shut out the West Virginia Mountaineers  in the Backyard Brawl on Friday Pitt volleyball shut out the West Virginia Mountaineers  in the Backyard Brawl on Friday at the West Virginia Coliseum PERIOD

With game scores of   and  the Panthers   Big East recorded their seventh shutout of the season PERIOD Pitt needed the win against the Mountaineers   after dropping its last two conference games at Georgetown and South Florida PERIOD

Georgetown and USF are both good teams said Pitt head coach Chris Beerman PERIOD Top to bottom the Big East is very difficult PERIOD This time we put our head in the right place. leading the Panthers to their shutout victory was junior Jessica Moses who posted a matchhigh . hitting percentage PERIOD

Jess has flown under the radar for awhile but shes very consistent Beerman said PERIOD Shes a kid thats improved every year and this year she took it up a notch. along with her hitting percentage Moses recorded  kills seven blocks and three digs PERIOD

Its what a coach asks for Beerman said PERIOD You say I just want you to compete as hard as you can. thats exactly what she does PERIOD Shes become a great leader. also leading were senior Diana Andreyko with  kills and seven digs and sophomore Michelle Rossi who put up  digs PERIOD

We got better at a few things Beerman said PERIOD It was more mental than physical. the closest game of the match was the second one in which the Mountaineers and the Panthers were tied five different times PERIOD After a tie at  Pitt took control of the game and the lead following a kill by sophomore Megan Dooley that put the Panthers up  PERIOD

Dooley had four kills in the second match PERIOD

The Mountaineers made a quick comeback and ended up tying the game at  points PERIOD Pitt came back on its next play with a kill by Moses PERIOD

The play was assisted by freshman Emily Burke who led with a matchhigh  assists PERIOD

After that an ace by Moses and a kill by Andreyko gave the Panthers their eventual game win and later a match win PERIOD

Moses five kills and three block assists highlighted the first game and with the third game came five kills from Andreyko PERIOD

After Fridays game the Panthers will have five full days of practice to work on fundamentals training something that Beerman says doesnt happen very often PERIOD

The Panthers will take on Marquette and Syracuse this weekend after a gamefree week PERIOD

The games will be crucial to the Panthers as they look to extend their eightgame winning streak at home and maintain standing in the Big East Conference PERIOD

Were third in the Big East right now Beerman said PERIOD We just have to take care of business. join our newsletter
