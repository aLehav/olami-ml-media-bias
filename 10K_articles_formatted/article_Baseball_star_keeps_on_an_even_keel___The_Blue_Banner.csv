Corey Randall Bulldogs pitcher and frequent starter said when he leaves the game after his UNC Asheville career he may be heading to the Navy to follow in his older sisters footsteps PERIOD

According to the junior new media student it will be his first time since age four away from
the baseball field except for one summer break PERIOD He played golf basketball and football
successfully in his youth but baseball won out for him by high school PERIOD

He liked the team concept said his mom Pam Randall PERIOD Corey said his UNCA teammates are like family to him PERIOD Even waking up at  a.m PERIOD to work out is a bonding experience PERIOD They go through things together PERIOD

His sister Taylor  said Corey works to improve himself consistently and is known for helping
others too like showing up to help with practice at his former high school in Mocksville North Carolina PERIOD

He respects everybody Pam said PERIOD Hes not judgmental. corey said he especially admires Taylor a naval officer stationed in Virginia Beach PERIOD

Shes really driven PERIOD Whatever she sets her mind to she does it he said PERIOD I really want to follow what shes doing PERIOD Any time you can serve your country I think its a good thing to do. likewise Taylor said Corey puts  percent of himself into what hes doing and can even be
hard on himself PERIOD

I am a competitor on the field but I try to remember theres always another game he said PERIOD

Corey grew up playing both baseball and golf with good prospects PERIOD He was traveling by age nine PERIOD

He placed in junior golf tournaments around the same time PERIOD

Through middle school he gave basketball and football a turn PERIOD His dad said he has always been
a wellrounded natural athlete PERIOD

In tenth grade during his first season in varsity baseball he was struggling as a pitcher for the
first time his dad said PERIOD Thats how they discovered he needed contact lenses PERIOD By eleventh grade he
was an All Conference player batting . in 4A PERIOD As a senior he was All Conference Player of
the Year PERIOD

Before any game he listens to music to get in the zone. anything from STYX ACDC and Led Zeppelin to Drake  Chainz and Katy Perry PERIOD

The only activity that rivals playing baseball for Corey is watching baseball he said PERIOD He also wants to use the skills hes developing in interactive media to promote the game PERIOD

The toughest aspect of his life as a student has been managing his time PERIOD Outside of his time in
class on the field or in the gym he still golfs with his dad and likes fourwheeling watching
Netflix and shooting recreationally PERIOD

Inside of baseball his heroes are John Lester and Felix Hernandez PERIOD In his own life his family is
his greatest support attending many games over the years and always sincerely interested in
how hes doing PERIOD

He even appreciates his teachers interest in how his team is doing and said he is grateful the
school is working on improvements to their resources PERIOD

Corey described himself as easygoing and his family highlighted his laidback quiet qualities PERIOD

But he is also a selfdescribed goofball and his mom Pam added He has a lot of confidence PERIOD But he doesnt overemphasize how hes doing and thats what I love about him. the Student Voice of UNC Asheville
