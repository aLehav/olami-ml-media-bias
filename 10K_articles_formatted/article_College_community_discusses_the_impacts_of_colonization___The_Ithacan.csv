The discussion began by exploring the idea of land acknowledgment or the act of recognizing the traditional territories of indigenous people PERIOD Freshman Shayna Yasunaga said land acknowledgment is an important first step to respecting indigenous people but acknowledgment alone is not enough PERIOD

Its a mutual level of respect for the land that youre standing on the land that youre rooted on she said PERIOD Its not just acknowledging PERIOD Its a lifestyle and its a culture that we are living in PERIOD We have to have respect about who we are where we are and the history behind the soil that we are on right now. junior Luis Valderrama copresident of IC Proud said land acknowledgment is a way to open up discussions about the other challenges indigenous tribes face PERIOD

I think that land acknowledgments are really important but also no structural problem can be solved by just one thing they said PERIOD This is meant to recognize and bring attention to a much larger historical structural problem. the group also explored the topic of what it means to be indigenous and the idea of where home is PERIOD

Rowan Larkin  administrative assistant in the Office of the Provost said the Students of Color Coalition a newly formed student organization to create unity among students of color and the Ithaca community wanted to frame the discussion of living on indigenous land through the eyes of a person of color PERIOD

A lot of times examining your role as someone who lives on indigenous lands can be a hard thing for people of color especially to navigate because some people have ancestors who were brought here forcibly and some have family who immigrated here Larkin said PERIOD We all have different relationships to the land. yasunaga said that being on indigenous land has given her conflicting feelings PERIOD

Oftentimes we dont even remember where we come from not just mentally or emotionally but physically Yasunaga said PERIOD I kind of feel like a hypocrite for being a part of my culture but not a part of culture so moving here on indigenous land is even further from who I am. members of the discussion suggested supporting indigenous artists performers and musicians by buying native artwork music and crafts as a way to encourage and recognize the local impact of indigenous groups PERIOD

Valderrama said the conversation made them think more about their existence and identity PERIOD

I think this whole conversation just makes me think a lot about all of the pain and suffering that had to happen for me to be here in this moment they said PERIOD It is very painful and uncomfortable to think about but is also something that I need to acknowledge and that I cant just erase 

Yasunaga said she was surprised by what she had in common with other members at the discussion PERIOD

I think being able to talk about it is refreshing she said PERIOD Ive never met these people in my life but I can connect with them in ways that I didnt really recognize. your donation will support The Ithacans student journalists in their effort to keep the Ithaca College and wider Ithaca community informed PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
