Updated November     pm





Senior quarterback Jake Locker hasnt lived up to his preseason expectations PERIOD Locker wont be playing this Saturday at Oregon due to a broken rib PERIOD



When Mel Kiper Jr PERIOD uttered those words this past spring we went all in PERIOD

We became the conductors of the Locker Hype Train sung his praises to all corners of the nation and called him a Heisman Trophy frontrunner one of the nations best and one of the greatest players in Washington history PERIOD

The tide has turned PERIOD Our wunderkind has been anything but spectacular PERIOD Hes no longer the future number one pick  hes the Ferndale Flop PERIOD

The truth lies somewhere between these extremes PERIOD Through a cluttered and confusing season for both he and the Huskies only one thing has emerged as clear Locker is the biggest enigma in Husky history PERIOD

He is a worldclass athlete maybe the most talented to ever play at the UW PERIOD Who else could have been a tenth round pick in the MLB draft after three years away from baseball Yet at this point in his career he is simply not as good a quarterback as he has been hyped up to be PERIOD

He has all the natural ability in the world PERIOD Nobody should question that PERIOD What they should question is his ability to throw an accurate deepball his decisionmaking in the pocket and the consistency of his play PERIOD

His highs have produced some of the greatest performances in Husky history including upsets of USC the past two seasons PERIOD But his lows are simply too low for a player deemed to be one of the best in the nation  see the fiasco of forced passes and overthrows against Nebraska PERIOD

Locker has not been the savior we wanted when he set foot on campus five years ago PERIOD The UW hasnt even sniffed the Las Vegas Bowl in his time here much less the Rose Bowl PERIOD But he has been the leader and symbol we needed inspiring hope once again on Montlake that led to the hiring of Steve Sarkisian PERIOD

Lockers place in Husky lore is difficult to derive PERIOD Statistically he is the equal or better of almost every great quarterback in the schools history from Heinrich to Hobert PERIOD Yet his  career record as a starter leaves him woefully behind them all in the ultimate measure of quarterback success winning PERIOD

But should Locker really be punished for coming to the UW at the lowest point in the schools history Its easy to win surrounded by a plethora of AllAmericans PERIOD Its difficult to make the decision that Locker did  to come to his hometown school with the knowledge that wins would be tough to come by and that he would be held almost solely responsible for the teams success or failure PERIOD

Locker is truly a unique figure in Husky history PERIOD For much of his career he was a diamond surrounded by coal yet a diamond not as brilliant as we all once believed PERIOD He will be remembered as an Achilles a historically gifted figure with a great flaw  he is simply not as good as we all wanted PERIOD

And like Achilles he will be remembered all the more fondly for his imperfection PERIOD
