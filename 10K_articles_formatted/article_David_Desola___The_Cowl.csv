Hay tres clases des personas los de arriba los de abajo los que caen PERIOD Such is the way in The Pit a vertical prison imagined by writers David Desola and Pedro Rivera and put onto screen by director Galder GazteluUrrutia in The Platform originally El Hoyo PERIOD The Pit consists of at least  levels with two prisoners on each level PERIOD Every day a platform filled with a decadent array of food lowers from level zero until it reaches the last level at which point it returns to level zero always with no food remainingonly bones and broken bottles PERIOD

At each level the prisoners have two minutes to eat whatever they can all food or scraps must be returned to the platform when it lowers or else the prisoners on that level will be boiled or frozen alive PERIOD By the time the platform descends  levels most of the food has already been consumed or defiled by the  people above PERIOD Those on the higher levelslos de arribagorge themselves without thinking of those on the lower levelslos de abajo PERIOD The only exception is when those at the top step spit urinate and defecate on the food in an attempt to make it inedible for those below them PERIOD

At first these acts seem to be completely senseless PERIOD It should not affect anyone who has already eaten if the people below them get to eat right Unfortunately though sometimes fortunately levels are reassigned each month PERIOD It matters not your age race class gender or crimeyou can move from level  to level eight overnight PERIOD GazteluUrrutia smartly places all of the action of The Platform in The Pit to show that regardless of who you are outside in the real world once you enter The Pit everyone is the same PERIOD

The Platform is an anticapitalism film PERIOD There is the obvious distinction between the people who run The Pit and the people who live in it however there is the added distinction between those at the top and those at the bottom of The Pit PERIOD The interesting dynamic in The Platform is the fact that the people within these categories change every month PERIOD Yet you can clearly see how people adjust to their level either acting with increased greed or desperation always selfishly PERIOD Though one thing remains constant they feel a sense of superiority over those below them and a sense of resentment towards those above them even if they were in the same spot just one day ago PERIOD

Empathy does not exist in The Pit PERIOD It really is every person for themself which is why most people bring weapons as their one allowed item into The Pit PERIOD Even when some prisoners attempt to get others to ration what they eat in order to get more food to the people on the lower levels violence and threats are the only effective means of persuasion PERIOD Those at the top refuse because they feel as though they deserve to eat better after being at the bottom or to prepare themselves for being at the bottom PERIOD Those at the bottom refuse because they need to eat all that they can to survive PERIOD

Beyond its commentary on capitalism and power The Platform is a fascinating look into individual responsibility and morality PERIOD What role can the individual play in destroying or reforming an unjust system The film suggests that while individuals can only do so much cooperation between individuals is necessary to make life in an unjust system survivable PERIOD Though paradoxically people must die in order to make the system survivable PERIOD Is it possible to ensure everyone in The Pit or in society can survive The Platform suggests that the answer is no. in an unjust society some must die so that others can livehence los que caen those who fall PERIOD

In addition to the primary message of The Platform there is a secondary plot that viewers are introduced to early into the film a mother who rides down the platform each month desperate not for food but her child whom she believes to be somewhere in The Pit PERIOD No children are supposed to be in The Pit such a policy is meant to make The Pit a humane place PERIOD What would it mean if a child were discovered by those who prepare the food every day but who are not fully aware of how what happens to the food once it leaves level zero You will have to watch The Platform to find outthough the ending may not leave you satisfied PERIOD
