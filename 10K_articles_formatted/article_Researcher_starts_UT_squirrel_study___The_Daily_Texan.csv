5988,2023-07-11,"any regular to the SAC knows that UT squirrels are widespread and bold enough to swipe your ChickfilA fries PERIOD Whether you think these squirrely friends are an amusement or an annoyance UT researchers are finding use in them as a behavioral study PERIOD

Assistant anthropology professor Aaron Sandel is studying how squirrels on campus behave differently around humans than do squirrels in other areas PERIOD Sandel said he will evaluate squirrel behavioral evolution or how individual behaviors inform evolutionary advantages according to Nature PERIOD

Sandel completed a similar project at the University of Michigan and said he expects to replicate his results with new squirrels and students in Austin PERIOD

If a similar pattern emerges where campus squirrels are more tolerant around people than offcampus squirrels then thats evidence that its the campus effect rather than some other factor Sandel said PERIOD

One measure of human tolerance is flight initiation distance or the closest distance a human can get to an animal before it runs away according to Sandel PERIOD

With campus squirrels especially ones where they have such a history of being fed by people  rather than running away at Michigan at least the campus squirrels would see a person sometimes and start running toward them Sandel said PERIOD

Sandel said he suspects squirrels might be selfdomesticating or able to adapt to become more tolerant to humans without active human intervention PERIOD In addition to tolerance he said he is interested in complex cognition or critical thinking skills according to ResearchGate PERIOD He added that squirrels demonstrate complex cognition when they do things like bury a nut PERIOD Not only does this prevent other squirrels from stealing their nut but they can distinguish between their nut and other buried nuts PERIOD

Sandels focus on squirrels might come as a surprise given his background in primatology but he said they are ideal study subjects PERIOD

Theyre interesting because they have a lifestyle thats very similar to primates Sandel said PERIOD But they dont have the traits of primates. sandel added that squirrels are a best kept secret to behavioral evolution research since they have many practical advantages over primates PERIOD He added that one of these advantages is squirrels have shorter life cycles which allows researchers to study populations across generations more easily PERIOD

According to Sandel campus squirrels are also more accessible because he can study them on campus while he has to study primates in Uganda PERIOD He added that campus squirrels are more used to humans than primates in a lab which also makes them easier to observe PERIOD

This accessibility allows undergraduates such as anthropology senior Riley Derby  who is working with Sandel on the project  the chance to gain animal behavior research experience PERIOD He said he hopes to study primates like Sandel in the future PERIOD In the meantime Derby can be found in corners of campus collecting data on squirrels PERIOD More undergraduates will be added to the project when it formally launches next spring PERIOD

I plan to do exactly what Dr PERIOD Sandel is doing Derby said PERIOD

Sandel said researchers other than him are going nuts over squirrel research. for example UC Berkeley psychologist Lucia F PERIOD Jacobs is also cracking into behavioral evolution research using squirrels Sandel said PERIOD

Students might not be able to predict the next move a campus squirrel makes but they can expect to hear a lot more about them from researchers such as Sandel PERIOD
