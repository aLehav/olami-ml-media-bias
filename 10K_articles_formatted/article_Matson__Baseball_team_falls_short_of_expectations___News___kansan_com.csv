The college basketball season is over whether we like it or not PERIOD The spring recruiting period is underway but the Kansas basketball recruiting class is almost set for next season PERIOD

The change in season means a change of focus and its time to focus our attention on college baseball PERIOD

Well Kansas fans the college baseball season has been bleak to this point PERIOD What youre about to read about the team may disturb you PERIOD

Nine Big  schools field baseball teams PERIOD Out of those nine teams eight of them have won more than  percent of their overall games and the Kansas Jayhawks are the only team that hasnt PERIOD

A plethora of statistics show why the Jayhawks have been playing dismal baseball thus far PERIOD

In the Big  the Jayhawks rank last in team batting average onbase percentage slugging percentage runs hits and runs batted in PERIOD

In regards to pitching the statistics arent much better PERIOD In the Big  the Jayhawks are sixth in earned run average sixth in batting average fifth in hits allowed fifth in runs allowed eighth in walks and eighth in strikeouts PERIOD

Why are Kansas schools such as Wichita State and Kansas State winning more baseball games than Kansas

I understand that Kansas baseball doesnt possess a winning pedigree like Wichita State  a school that has advanced to the College World Series seven times and won the NCAA Championship in   and that baseball is a nonrevenue college sport that is secondary to basketball and football but Kansas baseball isnt meeting my expectations PERIOD

My expectations for Kansas baseball this season werent lofty  middle of the Big  standings would be adequate  but I didnt expect them to be last in the standings even though that was the case last season PERIOD Last season the Jayhawks finished last in the Big  winning only  percent of their conference games PERIOD They finished four games below . overall  PERIOD

Despite the Jayhawks recent woes they have accomplished quite a bit during Ritch Prices time as coach winning a conference championship clinching a spot in the NCAA Tournament twice and winning 30plus games in seven of nine seasons PERIOD The Jayhawks two trips to the NCAA Tournament in  and  doubled the number of appearances they made at the tournament in the  years before Prices arrival PERIOD

Price significantly changed the baseball programs fortunes during his tenure but is it time for a new direction

As long as the Texas and Oklahoma schools are in the Big  conference Kansas probably wont find themselves atop the Big  standings but they shouldnt find themselves last in the conference either PERIOD

Kansas baseball is a tough sell for high school recruits who are searching for a baseball program that can prepare them for the major leagues PERIOD Kansas baseball doesnt have a winning tradition like Texas or Texas AM PERIOD

Athletic Director Sheahon Zenger is serious about revamping the Kansas football program because its a cash cow but if the baseball teams struggles continue he should make an effort to revitalize the program PERIOD
