It was the final round of the Big Ten Championship PERIOD No PERIOD  Illinois which entered holding a 12shot cushion had seen its lead dwindle further and further throughout the day PERIOD All eyes were on the Illini anxiously waiting to see if the tournament favorites would be able to hold on for their second consecutive conference crown PERIOD

And yet the Illini didnt feel the pressure PERIOD

It was difficult but we just tried to stay in the present and take it shotbyshot senior Zach Barlow said PERIOD Every day except the first day we finished really well and I think that says a lot about our team PERIOD We stayed focused and stayed in it and stayed true to our game plan. in fact the Illini played even better under pressure Barlow said PERIOD



I dont think any of us got nervous PERIOD I think we really just took our concentration and our focus up another level Barlow said PERIOD Even though we werent playing as good as we would have liked and it was a lot closer than many people expected we were in it for the fight  We expected the other teams to play good PERIOD Maybe at the beginning we didnt meet their intensity but towards the end I think we really buckled down and focused and we came through. even as Northwestern closed the gap to five shots and Iowa made its charge toward the top of the leaderboard the Orange and Blue maintained their composure PERIOD

Spurred by a Chris DeForest chipin eagle on the thirteenth hole the Illini fought off the field and held on for a threestroke victory over secondplace Iowa PERIOD

We could tell the momentum was switching and I could tell that things were not going our way senior Matt Hoffman said PERIOD And then Chris DeForest made an eagle on number  PERIOD He pitched in from like  yards and all of a sudden the momentum just completely changed from then on PERIOD

I think that was the turning point that allowed us to finish the way we did and not really worry about what the other people were doing and just concentrate on what we were doing. that confidence down the stretch started all the way at the top with head coach Mike Small PERIOD

I wouldnt say I was nervous PERIOD I knew it was getting close Small said PERIOD But we were still on the golf course so we could control our own destiny and thats what I was relying on PERIOD My team played the last four or five holes very strong and that was encouraging. illinois was challenged by more than just the field though as wind played a large part in the weekends high scores PERIOD

The wind gave us some issues gave us some trouble Small said PERIOD When you play in the wind its very difficult to hold a lead. the Illini were able to overcome the conditions in large part due to their experience Hoffman said PERIOD The team competed at the Big Ten Championship with four upperclassmen and one sophomore all of whom were returning members of last years conferencewinning squad PERIOD

It just helped us keep our confidence to know that weve been there before and played in those conditions before Hoffman said PERIOD Just knowing that weve done it before gave us a lot of confidence in overcoming the wind and finishing well and playing well.",Illini of the Week: Menâ€™s golf - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
