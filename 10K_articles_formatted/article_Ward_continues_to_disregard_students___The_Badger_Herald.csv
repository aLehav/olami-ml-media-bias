2892,2013-03-14,"thirteen years ago students including thenAssociated Students of Madison chair Adam Klaus occupied the office of the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin PERIOD They occupied after a year of stalling and stonewalling by the chancellor PERIOD They occupied to demand the university ensure its apparel was not made in sweatshops by joining the Workers Rights Consortium PERIOD They intended to occupy until the chancellor met with them PERIOD The protesters remained peaceful and did not disturb any classes PERIOD

The chancellor however would not even stay in Madison to discuss the issue with the students PERIOD Instead he responded by sending in law enforcement  the police arrived with full riot gear armed with tear gas and forcibly dragged out the students PERIOD Arrests of more than  UW students persisted throughout the morning with outraged community members showing up to support the students PERIOD

The chancellor resigned a few months later under pressure due to his brutal treatment of students of UW PERIOD That chancellor was our very own current Interim Chancellor David Ward PERIOD

During the last year and a half of Wards return to UW as interim chancellor it is apparent that he has not learned from the mistakes he made during his first term PERIOD

Thirteen years ago students won their demands and our university is affiliated with the Workers Rights Consortium an independent third party factory monitoring organization PERIOD The WRC has performed factory investigations and found Adidas in violation of our University Code of Conduct for its refusal to pay . million to  workers who were formerly employed at its PT Kizone factory in Indonesia PERIOD Similarly the WRC has found Palermos Pizza a pizza manufacturing company in Milwaukee in violation of our code of conduct for violating workers right to freedom of association PERIOD

Thanks to past sitins we also have a Labor Licensing Policy Committee a shared governance committee that advises the chancellor on labor decisions PERIOD The LLPC has advised Chancellor Ward to cut the contracts with Adidas and Palermos Pizza on multiple occasions PERIOD

Palermos workers have been on strike for nine months after being illegally fired for organizing for better work conditions and Palermos Pizza represents unionbusting values contrary to UWs proworker procommunity values PERIOD Community groups and campus groups including the Dane County Board of Supervisors have encouraged the university to join the ongoing boycott of Palermos Pizza PERIOD

Ward has ignored the shared governance process students and the community PERIOD
Not only has Ward maintained his corporate antiworker values he has continued his antishared governance despotism that forced him to leave UW more than a decade ago PERIOD He has ignored ASM decisions student support for WISPIRGs funding and the recommendations of shared governance committees to cut our contract with Adidas PERIOD Now he is ignoring shared governance recommendations to cut our contract with Palermos Pizza PERIOD

As he nears the end of his term as interim chancellor Ward still has one last opportunity to turn his legacy around PERIOD He could choose to do his job and represent the voice of UW students and the Madison community or he could reinforce and further strengthen his reputation as a corporatist autocrat PERIOD To Chancellor Ward we say the decision is yours and the clock is ticking PERIOD

The UWMadPalermos coalition includes members of Student Labor Action Coalition Working Class Student Union Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Atzlan United Council United States Student Association the Teaching Assistants Association and the International Socialist OrganizationMadison among other organizations PERIOD
