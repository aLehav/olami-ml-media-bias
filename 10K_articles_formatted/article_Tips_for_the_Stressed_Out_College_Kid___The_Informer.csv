This time of year is always stressful for everyone PERIOD Im not talking about the holidays or finances Im talking about the finals week PERIOD Every semester it seems like there are  projects eight papers and six twohour long exams to get through PERIOD This also doesnt help that many professors do not coordinate with each other and make all of these things due on the same day PERIOD That being said I have a few helpful tips for the stressed out college kid PERIOD First make a calendar PERIOD I think this is one of the most underrated tools in your academic toolkit PERIOD Write down all of the due dates on your phone on an actual calendar or just make a calendar out of scratch paper and call it a day PERIOD This will help you keep track and not accidently forget to hand in that project PERIOD Also be sure to put on this calendar the times and days you plan on working on all of these things to give yourself proper time management PERIOD Second do not stress out PERIOD There is nothing worse than just replaying all of the things you havent done yet in your head PERIOD It only ends up being that much more difficult to start a project when all you can do is think about how much of it you havent even started yet PERIOD In my experience there is only one way to effectively do this stop worrying about how much you havent completed and start congratulating yourself on how much of your work you have completed PERIOD This will help you focus more and get engaged in your work PERIOD Finally ask for help if you need it PERIOD If youre writing an excessively long paper for gen PERIOD ed PERIOD credit ask one of your roommates or friends who have taken the class for some advice PERIOD You never know who is a secret genius that can help you get that A or C if thats all youre shooting for PERIOD There is also the student success center that can always help you find a tutor for almost any class you need help with PERIOD For those who do not know it is located right by Hawk Hall the red door on B comp PERIOD There you have it you can get through these next couple of weeks easy peasy just dont loose focus and youll be fine PERIOD
