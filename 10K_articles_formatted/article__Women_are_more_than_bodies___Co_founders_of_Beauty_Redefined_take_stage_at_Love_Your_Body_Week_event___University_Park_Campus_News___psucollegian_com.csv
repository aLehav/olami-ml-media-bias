Love Your Body Week is a great reminder for us to appreciate nurture and respect our bodies PERIOD But we should try to do this always and not just one week every year PERIOD

Objectification when consumed in time is the perfect first step to dehumanize somebody Kite said PERIOD

Another source of objectification was through the behaviors of women PERIOD Kite explained how women often judge each other based on their appearance by for example mocking their outfits PERIOD

The third source of objectification was through peoples own minds PERIOD People often selfobjectify by constantly comparing themselves to others including celebrities PERIOD

Lexie explained studies have shown selfobjectifiers often get lower scores in math and reading assessments as well as have less physical strength PERIOD Selfobjectification Kite said allows people to be used and abused because they dont feel good about themselves PERIOD

The sisters discussed body image resilience which is learning to love ones own body PERIOD

Body shame is caused by a disruption they explained which can be as little as a comment made by a loved one about ones weight PERIOD This can cause people to deal with their shame by hurting themselves with drugs alcohol and even the act of cutting themselves PERIOD

The sisters said that some people cope with body shame by staying in their comfort zone which means they will stay away from social functions to prevent negative thoughts brought on by comparing themselves to others PERIOD They explained that this is unhealthy because it masks the problem for a moment until the shame finds away to another part of that persons body PERIOD

The sisters said that mental might is a good way to fight body shame PERIOD This means people should be critical of all the negative thoughts they feel so they can see how ridiculous they really are PERIOD It may even be smart to stop using social media because social media is often what causes people to feel bad about themselves PERIOD

Other good ways to fight body shame are physical fortitude which means going out and doing things that make one happy and spiritual strength which allows people to find peace by focusing on forces beyond themselves that remove their senses of need PERIOD

Finally the sisters recommended social skillfulness meaning that people should stop talking about each others bodies PERIOD They said that when complimenting somebodys body they should pair it with a compliment on their character to remind him or her that they are more than a body PERIOD

One student Emily Quick said that the lecture gave her great advice for her job as a resident assistant for sorority girls PERIOD
