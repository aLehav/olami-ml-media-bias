Phillip Chong of Fairfax Va. a  Virginia Tech graduate with a double major in agricultural and applied economics and political science has been named one of  recipients in the United States to be awarded the Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship PERIOD Sponsored by the U.S PERIOD State Department the Fulbright grant program will provide Chong the opportunity to teach English in a secondary school in South Korea for one year beginning in July PERIOD

MQ What was your main interest when applying for the Fulbright grant

PC My main interest was to find a good program that would allow me to explore the world give back and enlarge a community PERIOD That was something I felt was important to me not only to give back but to gain a wider perspective of the world around me PERIOD

MQ What was the application process like

PC It was a lot like any other application you would do for grad school PERIOD Basically its an application that details your biography a few letters of reference an interview a personal statement and a proposed statement of what youre going to do over there PERIOD What I wrote was why I think I would be a good candidate to teach English and what my research proposal would be PERIOD But overall it was a pretty difficult application process PERIOD

MQ Why did you choose a teaching assistantship

PC During my time at Tech I spent a lot of time at Margaret Beeks Elementary School where I was a tutor for math and English programs PERIOD Teaching has always been something Ive had a real passion for and I genuinely enjoy working with other people especially with younger kids PERIOD I just thought this was a really neat opportunity for me to go out there and teach English and try to make an impact in something that I think Im pretty decent at PERIOD

MQ And why an assistantship in South Korea

PC Well I was born here in the United States but both of my parents are from South Korea PERIOD So it made a lot of sense for me to go back there and pick up the language a little better because even though I can speak it I think I have a lot of room for improvement PERIOD And I also think that that region is interesting in terms of economics history and culture so its a better way to expand my view PERIOD

MQ What part of South Korea are you going to

PC Im not quite sure yet PERIOD It will be anywhere except Seoul which is the capital and the biggest city in South Korea PERIOD

MQ What kind of background or training if any have you done to prepare yourself

PC I took a graduate course in the school of education and it was basically a methods class and teaching strategies so I think that will be incredibly helpful PERIOD They also provide a sixweek orientation where I will hopefully pick up some teaching techniques PERIOD But I think Tech has done a great job in preparing me with that graduate class and hopefully my previous experience at Margaret Beeks will be useful too PERIOD

MQ Have you ever visited South Korea or studied abroad before

PC The last time I visited South Korea was two years ago PERIOD But no I havent studied abroad which makes it even more interesting PERIOD Im a little excited and nervous about that PERIOD

MQ How will you face culture shock What do you expect to encounter in South Korea

PC Even though both my parents are Korean I definitely consider myself fully Americanized PERIOD And I understand the Korean culture but I think theres definitely going to be some kind of shock PERIOD Living there for a year will be interesting so Im positive that there is going to have to be some sort of adjustments made and I will have to adjust to the community around me PERIOD Even though I have the advantage of growing up in a Korean household I do expect some challenges and difficulties because I have grown up in American culture PERIOD And also I think the fact that Im KoreanAmerican will bring up some interesting issues in terms of identity and how the Koreans over there will perceive me PERIOD

MQ What type of research will you be conducting while in South Korea What do you hope to learn

PC In my proposal I stated that it would be a sociological study on how I am treated as a KoreanAmerican over there PERIOD Even though I may look Korean I dont exactly act Korean because Im definitely Americanized PERIOD I want to see how they perceive me  are they going to take me as a Korean or American or something in between Thats what my study is going to try and focus around and will mainly be based on my experiences over there PERIOD

MQ Do you have any other plans while in South Korea besides teaching English in a secondary school

PC Hopefully I can become active in the community I am placed in PERIOD I hope to see the type of athletic organizations that are over there are and if there are any baseball or basketball organizations PERIOD Hopefully I can become involved in that because I have experience coaching those sports over here PERIOD Besides that I do get some free time between Korean semesters so I am hoping to explore the region and that side of the world PERIOD

MQ What are your plans after you complete your teaching assistantship

PC Afterwards I will definitely be going to law school and I think I want to do international law which will fit in perfectly with the Fulbright grant PERIOD
