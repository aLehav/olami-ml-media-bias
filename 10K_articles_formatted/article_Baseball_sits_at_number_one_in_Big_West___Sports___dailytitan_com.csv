It may only be early April and the second conference series of the year for the No. cal State Fullerton baseball squad but every game from here out has postseason implications written all over it PERIOD

Suffering a devastating  defeat and relinquishing first place in the Big West to conference rivals No. uC Irvine   Friday night the Titans   rallied back taking the final two games of the series and moving into sole possession of the top slot in the standings PERIOD

I think tonight was a big character game said Titan Head Coach Dave Serrano about Saturday nights  win over UCI PERIOD We got knocked on our butts Friday and to be able to come back and win a dog fight with our crosstown rival one of the teams we think will be with us at the end of the year in the conference standings was huge. titan ace junior righthander Noe Ramirez showed his AllAmerican arm Saturday night muting UCIs hitters to just one earned run PERIOD With surgeonlike command over his fastball and changeup Ramirez carved up UCI hitters over . innings striking out nine on his way to his fifth decision PERIOD

When theres pressure on me I take it and try to do the best I can said Ramirez PERIOD I just bear down its all mental PERIOD You just have to be tough and fortunately for me everything was on point tonight. striking in the first the Titans jumped on the board capitalizing on sophomore center fielder Ivory Thomas leadoff single PERIOD Moving to third on a single from junior shortstop Anthony Trajano Thomas came in to score the games first run tagging on a line drive sacrifice to right by junior first baseman Nick Ramirez PERIOD

The lead would be shortlived as UCI would come back in the top half of the second to tie the game PERIOD

Singling to start the rally for the Anteaters senior left fielder Drew Hillman made it a new ballgame scoring off redshirt junior center fielder Fridays Titan slayer Christian Ramirezs single to center PERIOD

Things remained quiet until the fifth when the Titans were gifted a present from UCIs defense PERIOD With runners on first and second and one out Thomas grounded to short for what should have been an inningending double play PERIOD A throwing error by UCI junior second baseman Tommy Reyes to first allowed redshirt freshman catcher Jared Deacon to score from second handing the Titans the  lead PERIOD

The onerun gift was all the Titans needed as they handed the ball to twoway player Nick Ramirez in the ninth PERIOD

Sophomore center fielder Ivory Thomas with headsup baserunning skills scored the games first run PERIOD

After surrendering a leadoff single to Hillman a sacrifice and groundout put the tying run on third and sweat on the foreheads of the Titans PERIOD Tension high Ramirez struck out senior designated hitter Jonathan Hurst on a  pitch to seal the victory grabbing his seventh save of the season PERIOD

It was a big game to win said Nick Ramirez PERIOD We wanted to win every game in conference but we had that taken away last night PERIOD So now we want to go out winning every other game in conference. the rubber match between the Titans and Anteaters couldnt have been played on a more perfect Sunday afternoon PERIOD Under the spotlight of being televised on ESPNU the Titans shined rallying to defeat the Anteaters  and reclaim sole possession of first place in the Big West Conference PERIOD

Similar to Saturdays affair the Titans jumped to a  lead in the first PERIOD Thomas who bounced a single over UCI starting pitcher redshirt junior Crosby Slaughts head later scored on an RBIsingle to right from Titan starting pitcher junior Tyler Pill PERIOD

The Titans added a second run in the fourth but gave up the brief lead in the fifth when the Anteaters put four runs on the board shifting the games momentum PERIOD

Junior third baseman Blake Barbers outstretched glove couldnt stop a rocket from Hurst with one out PERIOD

Following a double by junior first baseman Jordan Leyland Hurst crossed home plate when a pitch from Pill skipped to the backstop PERIOD A dropped fly ball to center by Thomas allowed Leyland to tie the game PERIOD

The Anteaters would take the lead when junior shortstop D.J PERIOD Crumlich dropped a double just inside left field line driving in the goahead run PERIOD After walking redshirt senior right fielder Sean Madigan Pills day was done PERIOD

Relieving Pill of his duties righthanded sophomore Dylan Floro limited UCIs damage to just one more run charged to Pill PERIOD After surrendering a single to right giving the Anteaters the  lead Floro would induce a harmless grounder to second escaping the jam PERIOD

Its exciting said Floro about coming in to pitch in a tough situation PERIOD Its the best feeling in the world when you get out of it. the bottom half of the fifth frame the Titans quickly loaded the bases with no outs PERIOD Quiet all weekend freshman right fielder Michael Lorenzen fell behind quickly in the count  PERIOD Battling back and working the count full Lorenzen showed why he was one of Baseball Americas top preseason freshmen  of  clearing the bases with a triple to the leftcenterfield fence PERIOD

With two strikes I was looking for anything saidLorenzen PERIOD Ive always believed in playing hard playing your heart out PERIOD Gods gifted me with the ability to play this game so Im going to take full advantage of it and leave everything on the field. a shallow sac fly to center from sophomore left fielder Carlos Lopez on the subsequent atbat drove in Lorenzen giving the Titans a fourspot of their own and the  lead PERIOD

It goes to show that no deficit is too big of a deficit and were able to stick together as teammates pull together and fight through adversity Serrano said PERIOD

The tworun cushion would increase to five in the sixth PERIOD In a dj vulike sequence the Titans again loaded the bases  although this time with two away PERIOD Bases full Lopez delivered the dagger driving a tworun single through the four hole PERIOD

After the Lopez stinger two consecutive walks would force home the Titans final run of the inning PERIOD

In the eighth with the Titans cruising behind the arm of Floro  shutting down the Anteater offense from the fifth inning on  Barber in Nick Ramirezlike fashion homered for the Titans final run of the day PERIOD

The Titans next game is on the road Tuesday against the always tough Loyola Marymount University Lions PERIOD The Titans defeated the Lions  in March for the first time since the  season PERIOD
