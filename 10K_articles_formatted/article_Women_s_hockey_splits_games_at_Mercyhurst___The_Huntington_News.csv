The Northeastern womens hockey team ended this weekend with a  win on Friday followed by a  loss on Saturday both against Mercyhurst University in Erie Pa PERIOD

I really liked the way we played Friday Head Coach Dave Flint said PERIOD We need that consistency on backtoback nights. in its first win of the season Northeastern was aggressive right from the start PERIOD

We came out strong we didnt let up freshman defenseman Lauren Kelly who scored the gamewinner in Fridays game said PERIOD We just kept attacking. while neither team put up a point in the first period Northeastern changed that quickly in the second PERIOD A minute and a half in Mercyhurst junior forward Hannah Bale received a twominute penalty for tripping PERIOD Teammates celebrated when Kelly took advantage of the power play  seconds later PERIOD Freshman defenseman Ainsley MacMillan passed to Kelly who took a slap shot over the glove of Mercyhurst junior goaltender Amanda Makela PERIOD

It felt awesome Kelly said after scoring her first collegiate goal PERIOD

On Monday MacMillan was named the Pro Ambitions Rookie of the Week in Hockey East PERIOD

The Huskies continued their momentum scoring another goal less than three minutes later PERIOD Senior forward Chelsiea Goll took a shot off a breakaway which deflected off the post into the slot PERIOD Junior forward Paige Savage was right there and able to pick up the rebound throwing the puck past Makela for Northeasterns second goal PERIOD

In the third period Northeastern kept things going PERIOD With assists from junior forward Kendall Coyne and sophomore forward Hayley Scamurra MacMillan took a shot from the middle scoring her first collegiate goal PERIOD The puck ricocheted off a Mercyhurst defenseman and past Makela seven minutes into the period PERIOD

Up by three points the Huskies did not stop there PERIOD At the  mark Mercyhurst pulled its goalie while on a power play PERIOD Even with a 6on4 advantage for the Lakers Northeastern was still able to put one in PERIOD After numerous shots by Mercyhurst and some aggressive defense from Northeastern Coyne picked up a loose puck and shot on the empty net with  seconds left in the game PERIOD Coynes goal made the final score  PERIOD

We played a full  minutes like coach wanted Kelly said PERIOD We gave our best and that resulted in the score. flint was satisfied with the teamwork shown in the game PERIOD

I thought we played really well on Friday he said PERIOD We had a good effort from everybody and it showed on the scoreboard PERIOD On Saturday we had a good effort from not everybody sic PERIOD We were a little bit inconsistent. mercyhurst came out stronger in the second after another scoreless first period from both teams PERIOD At the  mark in the period Bale scored for the host team PERIOD

We started out okay and in the second period we all got a little down and tired and fatigued Kelly said PERIOD Our intensity dropped a little bit. ending the second period a goal down Northeastern looked for a comeback in the third PERIOD Freshman forward Halle Silva tied the game at the  mark with assists from freshman forward Taytum Clairmont and freshman forward Denisa Krizova PERIOD

The tie did not last long though PERIOD A minute and a half later sophomore forward Shelby Bram scored to give Mercyhurst the lead back PERIOD However Kelly responded  seconds later with a shot from the point to tie the game again at  PERIOD

After fighting to catch up the Huskies could not take the lead PERIOD Two minutes later Mercyhurst scored its third goal PERIOD Sophomore freshman Jaclyn Arbour deked Husky senior goaltender Chloe Desjardins to make the score  PERIOD

With time winding down in the game Northeastern pulled Desjardins to gain an offensive advantage PERIOD Mercyhurst freshman forward Emily Janiga took control scoring on the Huskies empty net to make the final score  PERIOD

We didnt play together which was one of the main reasons why we had the outcome we did Kelly said PERIOD

Despite the loss Desjardins made a total of  saves throughout the weekend including her eighth career shutout on Friday PERIOD

This week in practice the Huskies hope to make some improvements for their next games PERIOD

Were going to make a couple tweaks to our system PERIOD We still need to make improvements to power plays Flint said PERIOD We need to finetune some things in all three zones. kelly agreed that the team needs to stay determined in order to win games PERIOD

If we keep working hard and keep up the intensity well improve Kelly said PERIOD

Northeastern continues play next weekend on the road for two games against Robert Morris University on Oct PERIOD  and  in Moon Township Pa PERIOD

If we play how we did Friday night well see success Flint said PERIOD If we play inconsistently we wont PERIOD Were looking for two wins and hopefully well take care of business when we get out there. photo courtesy Jim Pierce Northeastern Athletics
