Hello lads and lasses  congratulations our favorite time of the year is upon us once again PERIOD

Hello lads and lasses  congratulations our favorite time of the year is upon us once again PERIOD Thats right time to watch others put on a facade and petition around to the masses in the search of that one ellusive goal .. PERIOD free candy PERIOD Oh wait Were talking about the election See I should have realized that what with the hordes of students walking around campus repetitiously asking whether we are registered to vote to the point where you interrupt them with an affirmative  as a means just to pass and avoid another lackluster conversation PERIOD How many different ways can they instruct us on how to vote I mean theres how to vote from home how to vote using an absentee ballot how to vote as a college student here in Blacksburg how to vote from the back of a giant Tyrannosaurus PERIOD

About a million years ago a legislative branch known loosely as  decided it would be a splendid idea to give college students the right nay the privilege nay the pleasure to vote for our avowed leader PERIOD They soon discovered the combination of pot smoke jagerbombs sexual endeavors and a dash of upandcoming narcissism was a lucrative one indeed PERIOD I guess my problem is trying to see how others can make voting out to be so appealing PERIOD Honestly now while I vote are the ballots going to come alive and begin singing  songs Doubt it PERIOD Do you know how many mushrooms you would have to eat before something like that would happen Six PERIOD

Well I sought out the architectural students here at Tech who in their own right suffer from a mild case of egotism in hopes of my first reputable proposal PERIOD I was informed  If you needed to read that sentence a second time dont worry so did I PERIOD However this led to a good point PERIOD Students cant familiarize themselves with our current candidates PERIOD They are not our peers rather they are our fathers or in McCains case our grandfathers age PERIOD Moving on lets return to our tissuethin veneer of consumer advice and talk about methods of getting you to vote PERIOD I can sit here and give yall a list of wornout mindnumbing suggestions ranging from informational parties to fliers and even political centers here on campus PERIOD We all know you would just walk right past the pretty girl with the clipboard or quickly dispose of that handy dandy flier she just handed out with a smile one which makes you think of asking for her number but then nerves and the flop sweat kick in and you swiftly scurry off back to your Halo  and Red Bull all within the sanctum of your dorm PERIOD

Thats just it Students spend a majority of their time here at college either in class in a dining hall or in their residence hall rooms PERIOD So let us discuss how best to infiltrate these locales PERIOD Breakthrough studies confirm alleged reports that college students live off their computers  who knew If anyone has seen this  clip online and Im sure everyone has this form of communiqu is the embodiment of a great idea PERIOD There is no better way to reach collegiate masses than with this quaint edifying but most importantly convicting message and lasting a mere five minutes just short of the sixminute ADD attention span we all seem to possess in our multimediafilled state of ecstasy PERIOD I feel our bureaucratic fatheads are beginning to realize that there is an untapped resource in our society  known loosely as the college demographic that is the future bureaucratic fatheads if you will PERIOD

So the point Im trying laboriously to get to What could be the driving force to get outside and vote If our government really wanted our votes they should hold two events across the nation a Chris Brown concert and a Carmen Electra striptease placing a booth at the entrance of both and requiring our vote for admission PERIOD But something tells me you are looking for more practical applications so just keep that one in your back pocket PERIOD As for a realistic idea Im sure this brainchild will certainly trick your trigger PERIOD See all us adolescents today need to continually ask  I propose universities across the nation begin an optional class that students can take once during their college stay PERIOD The class will include presentations on the candidates class discussions lectures on the political party views and opinions and debates from local House representatives PERIOD This will not only give students a chance to personally interact but also get a little  out of the whole deal PERIOD The class will only be held once every four years during that years fall semester meeting twice a week for an hour at a time PERIOD Via attending every class and by registering and successfully voting that student will receive two college credits PERIOD

Its funny how things stop being funny the longer you live with them. everyone in Britain stops snickering at the name Spotted Dick by the time they turn  PERIOD Ive almost completely forgotten that Nintendo named a console after a bodily fluid and its funny now how we can hear the word politician and not think of someone who can successfully talk for hours and never actually say anything PERIOD More than ever our presidential candidates are vocalizing their message PERIOD All you have to do is listen and come Nov PERIOD  simply cast your vote not for me not for your pastor your mother even your country but rather simply for your own well being PERIOD
