5361,2021-01-10,"one of the least rational things to do during a pandemic is move to a new country PERIOD Starting over in an unfamiliar city without friends learning at a completely new institution and dealing with a nonnative language is a seemingly pretty ridiculous choice to make in the year  PERIOD And yet this past fall I was surrounded by hundreds of questionably bold people who also moved to Israel midCOVID19 PERIOD

Under normal circumstances studying abroad is the time to ditch class and travel around your new home PERIOD Its when you eat at local restaurants linger at bars until morning hours and somehow allow your friends to drag you to a club blasting music you dont really understand PERIOD My friends who returned from abroad would wave their hands excitedly as they told me about the friends they made in hostels and their coffee dates with random bartenders PERIOD I had anticipated that I too would share in this American studyabroad experience during my own junior year of college PERIOD

It has taken me four months in Jerusalem  complete with two weeks in quarantine isolation two country lockdowns and toosmall social gatherings  to begin to understand that my positive experiences here did not happen in spite of COVID19 but perhaps because of it PERIOD

In October I moved to the student apartments for my fall semester at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem PERIOD Due to online classes a lack of organized social events and the empty student village it was difficult to meet people upon my entry to this new school PERIOD I too was a quasi2020 college frosh PERIOD However unlike the firstyear student who has four full years ahead of them the temporality of my time at HebrewU added an additional bizarre element to the coronacollege equation PERIOD

Luckily within a few weeks I grew close with several people who also lived in Building  Floor  PERIOD Our limited ability to explore around campus or meet locals our age in the city pieced together an unlikely collection of people PERIOD We hailed from four continents studied all sorts of majors and had few hobbies in common PERIOD If it werent for COVID truthfully we probably would not have come together PERIOD

Our time spent as a group did not resemble the class ditching city traveling food tours and bar hopping that usually accompany a semester abroad PERIOD The closed shops restaurants and university campus along with the lack of tours performances and cultural events cultivated a more intimate feel PERIOD We ate dinners togethers explored markets and nature hikes held movie nights and worked out in the grass area outside our building PERIOD We learned how to prepare elaborate meals only using the stove top and a water kettle PERIOD We laughed at the boys when they grew beards PERIOD

Our own patchwork of a quarantine family joined together for special occasions too PERIOD Our holidays in the holy city were felt in mildly underwhelming yet very homey ways PERIOD Shabbat dinners were a fascinating blend of Jews and Christians from all sorts of religious observance backgrounds PERIOD Thanksgiving brought together two Americans and two Germans PERIOD Hanukkah evenings consisted of frying latkes and lighting candles with whoever was around PERIOD Birthdays took place beside fire pits and vegetarian barbecues in forest campgrounds PERIOD Traditional Chinese dumplings were eaten for the East Asian Dongzhi or Winter Solstice Festival PERIOD Christmas was spent together in the Christian city of Nazareth PERIOD All of these religious and national traditions blended even more alongside the sounds of Muslim calls to prayer five times daily PERIOD

Despite the fact that my new friends and I knew that we would part ways in just two short months we lived our COVIDlimited lives to the fullest PERIOD These throwntogether meals grocery shopping excursions outings to the Old City of Jerusalem and adapted holiday celebrations were definitely not the semester any of us had expected PERIOD And yet it was exactly these moments which made my experience so whole PERIOD

Without a doubt we wouldve had a more exploratory experience without the impacts of the coronavirus however we grew simultaneously independently and together PERIOD Heightened by the pandemics constantly changing news and regulations the Israeli culture of lizrom  to flow  tested our ability to not only adapt but be excited by the change PERIOD We were forced to live in the present in ways none of us had ever truly experienced before PERIOD Within three short months I felt the beginnings of a deepseeded shift in my perspective PERIOD

When I first arrived in Israel lack of information about the coronavirus and its effects on societythe disorganized university structure and feelings of loneliness overwhelmed my ability to relax PERIOD The semester at HebrewU though COVID19 nor Israeli disorganization improved validated the importance of focusing on the current moment by seeking positive relationships with likeminded supportive people PERIOD I didnt have time to worry about the future or about impending country lockdowns for my move to Israel would have been for nothing PERIOD I appreciated the simple joy in cooking with my neighbors or adventuring to another building to do laundry together PERIOD With this mindset I made the decision to stay in Israel for another six months PERIOD

Now a few months later I wait for my next program to start in two weeks where the same situation awaits me a raging pandemic and a notsoorganized program filled with people I havent yet met PERIOD This time however Im far more excited about the uncertainty that awaits me PERIOD Failing to even know the address of my new apartment Im honestly relaxed in waiting for whatever comes next PERIOD
