There are three basic types of resume formats that can be used based on professional experience
Chronological resume
The chronological resume is most effective if a student has good professional or internship experience Thomas said PERIOD Typically a student would have an experience category that would list the most recent experience that was relevant to the position the student was applying for PERIOD For work or other experience that was not as relevant to the position there can be a category listed for other experience PERIOD
Chronological resumes are typically what employers look for she said PERIOD The great thing about a relevant experience category is it that you can include more than just paid positions. functional resume
The functional resume may be best for students who do not have a great deal of professional or internship experience she said PERIOD
The individual is highlighting more of their skills and less of where they receive them from she said PERIOD There is more of a focus on abilities and less focus on work history. the functional resume makes it possible to tie in relevant skills received from extracurricular activities academic course work or volunteer work she said PERIOD
Combination resume
The combination resume is a good resume to use if an employer is looking for other specific qualities that pertain to the job position she said PERIOD
If an employer wants to see your work history but they also want to see your leadership experience it is possible to have a separate leadership experience category along with a work experience category she said PERIOD You are tailoring it to whatever position you apply for. while it is necessary to make sure a resume has the most relevant work experience on top there are also little things that employers check for she said PERIOD
Ive seen employers throw out a resume because of bad grammar or missed spelling she said PERIOD Always check for grammar PERIOD Those are the things employers often use to weed out candidates. career Services can be contacted by phone at
