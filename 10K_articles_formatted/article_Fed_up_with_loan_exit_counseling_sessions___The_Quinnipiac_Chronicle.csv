If you dont already know if you borrow federal student loans then the government requires you to complete an exit counseling session according to Quinnipiacs Associate Director of Financial Aid and Loan Coordinator Mary Sola PERIOD However Quinnipiacs system for these sessions is hugely flawed PERIOD

The exit counseling session is intended to prepare students for repayment on their loans according to an email from Sola PERIOD But if thats the case why arent these sessions more personal Why dont we get the opportunity to have a oneonone conversation with someone in financial aid to help us work out the details of paying back federal loans rather than in a large group

Since the average tuition for Quinnipiac is over  per year its baffling that the university doesnt require  or even suggest  students sit down oneonone with someone in financial aid and discuss their options or create possible realistic repayment plans PERIOD If students have to meet with their advisors to plan out their schedule for each semester doesnt it seem feasible that they should meet with someone in financial aid to discuss their postgraduation financial options

Beyond not having more consistent financial advice and guidance throughout our time at Quinnipiac it bothers me that the sessions they hold for loan repayment advice are only held at certain times over certain days PERIOD As someone who has extracurriculars class five days a week and work five days a week my schedule isnt very flexible PERIOD So naturally all the sessions  on the Mount Carmel campus and the North Haven campus  conflict with my either my classes or my work study job PERIOD

As I previously mentioned these sessions should be more personalized PERIOD Sure maybe the university cannot seem to allocate the proper resources for all of its students  or even just those with federal loans  to receive financial guidance throughout their four years at this university PERIOD But if students can only attend one mandatory session during their senior year it seems likely that the university could work something out so that the students who want the help should be able to sit down and have an inperson oneonone conversation with someone in financial aid PERIOD

These sessions are open to however many students at a time and I couldnt imagine myself feeling comfortable asking personal financialrelated questions in front of large groups of people PERIOD And I have quite a significant amount of questions and as of right now I have no idea how Im going to get answers  other than a pathetic Google search that will probably just confuse me even more PERIOD

Ultimately these loan counseling sessions seem forced and impersonal PERIOD I dont come from a family with a significant amount of money and I dont have any current job offers prospects or even one single interview for a job after I graduate PERIOD Im horrified PERIOD Graduation means repaying loans that I dont have money to repay at the moment PERIOD And I dont know what I can do about that PERIOD But maybe I would have a better idea if the financial office was more helpful about the whole situation PERIOD

UPDATE This oped appeared in print in issue  which was distributed on March  PERIOD The writer received an email from Mary Sola on March  at  p.m PERIOD Since the email was not received prior to the issue being sent to the printerthe print versiondoes not reflect that an email response was received PERIOD
