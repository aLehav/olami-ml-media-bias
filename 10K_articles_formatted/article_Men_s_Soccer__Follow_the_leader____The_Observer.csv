Greg Arbogast  Tuesday September  

As the cross floated in Irish thenjunior midfielder Alex Yoshinaga eyed a header and perhaps his first goal of the young  season PERIOD

What he didnt see was Creighton goalkeeper Matt Allen crashing from his blind side in a move that would take Yoshinagas feet out from under him and send him crashing down on his shoulder PERIOD Just two games into his junior season Yoshinagas year was ended by a broken collar bone PERIOD

What did Notre Dame lose when Yoshinagas injury ended his season

Tremendous drive energy and enthusiasm Irish coach Bobby Clark said PERIOD Those are the things you think of when you think of Yosh. a big part of our team senior forward Kurt Martin said of his teammate PERIOD He was our central midfielder so obviously we had to make some changes. the Irish lost all that a player who started  games in his first two seasons in South Bend racking up five goals three assists and  points PERIOD

But despite all Notre Dame lost when Yoshinaga went down they might have gained something too  a new team leader PERIOD

After realizing his playing time was over for the rest of the season Yoshinaga set out to contribute in other ways off the field PERIOD Last January he attended a leadership conference set up by the Notre Dame athletic department for senior athletes PERIOD There he received a book on how to become a leader PERIOD Throughout the spring semester Yoshinaga went about reading one chapter a week with Clark and the results were clear PERIOD

He began to think about how he could become a leader and all the lessons were put forward in the book Clark said PERIOD He started to put them into practice with the team and hes become an excellent leader. yoshinaga immediately began to display his newfound leadership skills leading pregame rituals to help the team focus on tasks ahead PERIOD He also supported teammates who werent getting their desired playing time PERIOD And the other Irish players took notice voting Yoshinaga one of this years team cocaptains along with senior defender Ryan Miller and junior defender Matt Besler PERIOD

As a leader hes grown a lot Martin said PERIOD Him getting injured forced him to become more of a leader and hes proved it this year PERIOD Now hes more involved. yoshinaga also recognizes that the experience affected him in how he approaches the game both on and off the field PERIOD

I had had up until then adequate playing time every year and going from that to watching on the bench gives you a different perspective on things Yoshinaga said PERIOD After I came back I didnt take it for granted but and this sounds kind of cheesy I gave it my all every time PERIOD I think it was a blessing in disguise. although Yoshinaga and his teammates admit that he benefited greatly from his time on the sideline all are glad that the senior midfielder is roaming the center of the pitch for the Irish once again PERIOD

Since his return Yoshinaga has wasted little time in making his presence felt once again PERIOD In Notre Dames first game of the season against thenNo PERIOD  UCLA he scored the gamewinning golden goal in addition to assisting on the teams first goal of the game PERIOD

And despite that performance he is still motivated by last years injury PERIOD

To tell you the truth I havent contributed as much as I should have these past couple of years and last year I didnt contribute at all Yoshinaga said PERIOD I just want to contribute as much as I can. thanks in part to last years injury he is more capable than ever of doing just that PERIOD
