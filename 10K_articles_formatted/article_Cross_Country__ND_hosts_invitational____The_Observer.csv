The Irish men and women are hoping to benefit from some home cooking this weekend as they participate in the National Catholic Championships on Friday  their first home meet of the season PERIOD

This is the thirty-third running of the National Catholic Championships and the Irish have dominated the event throughout its history PERIOD Notre Dame has won the team event  times and has had  individual winners PERIOD This year they are trying to make it four straight team titles PERIOD

The mens and womens teams notched secondplace finishes in their previous outings at the Crusader Open in Valparaiso Ind. two weeks ago PERIOD Although the Irish did not win the meet many young runners gained experience PERIOD

With the Notre Dame Invitational looming in two weeks Irish coach Joe Piane said this meet is for the older runners to get into the flow of the season PERIOD

The meet at Valparaiso was for some of our inexperienced runners to get their feet wet Piane said PERIOD This week is for the older guys like senior Jeremy Rae and junior Walter Schafer to get their feet wet PERIOD

Cross country is just like other sports runners need some warmups and scrimmages before they can really hit their stride and perform at a high level. both the mens and womens teams come into this meet ranked in the top25 and are both expecting high finishes on their home track PERIOD

I think having a meet at home gives us a big advantage Piane said PERIOD The kids are familiar with the track and we do not have to put up with the hassles involved with traveling. the Irish will have plenty of competition as the race includes a 34team field with  Division I programs PERIOD

On the mens side Shafer and junior Martin Grady both finished in the topfive last year and are hoping for an even better performance this year while senior Jessica Rydberg is looking to defend her title in the womens race PERIOD

The race will begin Friday at  p.m PERIOD with the womens 5K race and will be followed by the mens fivemile race at approximately  p.m PERIOD Both races will take place at Warren Golf Course PERIOD
