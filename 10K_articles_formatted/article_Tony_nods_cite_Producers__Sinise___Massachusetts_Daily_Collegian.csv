Perhaps the biggest surprise and disappointment is the absence of Seussical The Musical from the event  it only acquired one nomination for Best Actor Kevin Chamberlain who plays Horton the Elephant PERIOD Its a plain shame that his farfromnoteworthy performance is the only trace of Seussical that will be represented PERIOD More appropriate would have been a nomination for Janine LaManna as Gertrude McFuzz or David Shiners stellar performance as The Cat In The Hat he has since left the show being replaced with gymnast Cathy Rigby PERIOD The most painful exemption is Stephen Flahertys marvelous score and Lynn Ahrens fabulous lyrics PERIOD Both are totally neglected PERIOD 
The shows up for Best Revival of a Musical are more evenhanded PERIOD There is the pop culture nomination The Rocky Horror Show the cultish Sondheim fare Follies and the obligatory theatre standards forty-second Street and Bells Are Ringing both of whose female leads Christine Ebersol and Faith Prince respectively are up for Tonys PERIOD Its sixofone halfadozen of another in this category theyre all worthy contenders in the most heated match of the evening PERIOD 
Certainly The Tonys dont consist only of musicals PERIOD The plays that are up for grabs share a similar trend to the aforementioned musicals PERIOD Theres King Hedley II which recently took on board the awesome talent of Brian Stokes Mitchell Ragtime alongside The Allergists Wife Proof and the Tom Stoppard crowdpleaser The Invention of Love PERIOD 
Of chief joy was the nomination for Gary Sinises jawdropping tourdeforce performance in the revival of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest PERIOD Up against him are the likes are the aforementioned Mitchell Richard Easton for The Invention of Love and both Sean Campion and Conleth Hill for Stones In His Pockets PERIOD Sinise however is a shoein his Hollywood crossover appeal will definitely help him out PERIOD Similarly Mary LouiseParker for Proof and Juliette Binoche for The Betrayal will more than likely go headtohead but Leading Actress in a Play has always been a deadlock and it looks like this year is no exception PERIOD 
Director Jack OBrien is the Steven Soderbergh of the Tonys this year hes up for two awards one for the musical The Full Monty and the other for the play The Invention of Love PERIOD Its more a curse than a blessing though because with a competitor like Susan Stroman who is the new Julie Taymor of Broadway so it seems OBrien is facing an uphill battle PERIOD 
It seems apparent that the Tonys will come down to one thing prestige PERIOD The positive responses and big box office take of The Producers will result in a sweep so grand it will leave Broadway buffs heads spinning PERIOD Broadway no longer seems to be a place for new talent to emerge but current superstars to blossom like Sinise PERIOD Shows like Seussical The Musical and Jane Eyre The Musical could have easily conquered had it been better timing plain and simple PERIOD 
No one can predict when a theatre season is going to be full of vigor like this one or dormant like it was in  cue crickets PERIOD What The Producers and The Full Monty The Musical will usher in however in addition to more screentostage adaptations Im sure is a renewed enthusiasm for the theatre a jolt of adrenaline to one of societys most celebrated art forms PERIOD When there are so many upsides to take note of it no longer matters who wins and loses PERIOD
