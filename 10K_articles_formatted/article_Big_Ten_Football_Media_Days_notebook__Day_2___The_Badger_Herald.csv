2824,2012-07-27,"cHICAGO  In a room full of about  football players and head coaches there is no shortage of confidence PERIOD Each player is incredibly hopeful about the upcoming season never willing to admit nerves about their chances especially in rivalry matchups PERIOD

The Big Ten is riddled with rivalries but perhaps the newest one is between two teams that sit atop the conference  Wisconsin and Michigan State PERIOD

In what are quickly becoming goto replay games the  MSUUW games are fairly easy to watch on repeat PERIOD And while players from both teams admit theyll watch those games over and over they tend to look away when things start to turn sour PERIOD

I feel like its on every day the Big Ten Championship or the one before it Wisconsin offensive lineman Ricky Wagner said PERIOD I sometimes watch them just a little bit  sometimes I look away. with so much to discuss within the Big Ten the burgeoning rivalry between Bucky and Sparty has been one of several muchdiscussed topics PERIOD

After an unbelievable Hail Mary finish in the regular season matchup followed by a rematch in the inaugural Big Ten Championship game just as intense as the first game  and with opposite outcomes  theres no real reason why the rivalry shouldnt be growing PERIOD

The reason weve had such a rivalry with Wisconsin is not only have they been close games that we play with them but theyve been games that mean a lot MSU senior linebacker Will Compton said PERIOD  You remember the Big Ten Championship you remember the Hail Mary pass PERIOD You always think Oh that was against Wisconsin so theyre always in youre head  its been a great tradition here the last couple of years. unlike most rivalries where mutual hate is a common theme respect is what defines the Michigan StateWisconsin matchup PERIOD

The thing about Wisconsin is I respect them a lot as a team and I have a lot of people I do know atWisconsinthat I am affiliated with MSU senior linebacker Chris Norman said PERIOD I have the utmost respect for their program and what those guys do and what they represent PERIOD That being said it does change once you get on the field especially because you want to win PERIOD But Ive got a lot of love for Wisconsin. wisconsin running back Montee Ball echoed Normans statement and immediately noted how strong its defense is as well PERIOD

This season the Badgers welcome the Spartans into Camp Randall Oct PERIOD  in what is already a highlyanticipated affair PERIOD

I know the next time we play Wisconsin Im going to have an extra edge about me and I know they are going to have the same extra edge as well Norman said PERIOD

All eyes on Ricky

At Wisconsin there might as well be a factory line producing offensive lineman ready made for the Outland Trophy and a first round draft pick PERIOD This years big guy Senior Ricky Wagner PERIOD

Describing the 6foot6  pound left tackle reserved or shy is an understatement PERIOD And while hes not as vocal as his fellow spotlighted teammate Ball Wagner isnt worried about the new publicity hes receiving PERIOD

I really dont have any pressure on me Wagner said PERIOD It might seem like I do but I dont feel it at all PERIOD

I want to be the best Olineman in the nation PERIOD I think thats everybodys goal playing the position but I really think I can accomplish that if I just keep doing what Ive been doing. now the veteran leader of the offensive line Wagner said the main focus this off season has been getting the younger guys up to speed and in his opinion things have been going well PERIOD

A more mature defense

Representing Wisconsins defense at the Big Ten Media Days senior linebacker Mike Taylor spoke highly of the upcoming season  even in the face of the recent loss of defensive lineman Jordan Kohout who recently ended his football career due to medical issues PERIOD

On defense we should be pretty good maybe the best weve had in awhile Taylor said PERIOD Then again thats just talk youve got to wait until the season starts  were a little older this year on defense  Ive played with all these guys were almost the same age you just build this bond and trust to each other that you want to play for each other. last season Taylor led the defense with  tackles PERIOD Fellow linebacker junior Chris Borland wasnt far behind with  PERIOD The duo are expected to be just as potent in  but when asked about it Taylor immediately began speaking about another linebacker  junior Ethan Armstrong PERIOD

This summer just because me and Ethan Armstrong had the same hip surgery weve been around each other a lot and kind of built a pretty good relationship Taylor said PERIOD Im not saying hes going to be the other linebacker PERIOD Im not saying Im going to be PERIOD Going into the year its a blank slate for everyone. overall Taylor was extremely positive about what his defense is capable of in the upcoming season especially with their gameexperience but remained cautious noting they still have to play a game first PERIOD

Kelly is a senior majoring in journalism PERIOD What are you worries concerning the  Badgers Let her know kellymerickson PERIOD
