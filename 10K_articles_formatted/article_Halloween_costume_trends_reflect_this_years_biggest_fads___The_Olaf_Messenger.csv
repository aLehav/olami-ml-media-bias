The Government Shutdown

Commemorate everyones favorite petty slapfight of this past year by going as the government shutdown PERIOD Throw on a few political buttons and wear a sport coat over pajamas to be a furloughed government employee PERIOD Spend the night asking those around you if they know of any nongovernmental job openings PERIOD If you want to take it one step farther dress up as the Lincoln Memorial PERIOD All you need is a top hat and a beard although you can go to the extreme and paint your face hair hat and beard white for a marblelike effect and hang a sign around your neck that says Sorry were closed

Miley Cyrus and the Wrecking Ball

Lets just take a moment and thank Miley for providing so much material for Halloween costumes this year PERIOD This costume is best executed with a friend Have one person be Miley and the other be the wrecking ball PERIOD For the Miley costume wear a white crop top white hot pants and heavyduty work boots PERIOD Red lipstick and slickedback hair complete the look bonus points if you carry around a sledgehammer the whole night and occasionally lick it PERIOD For the wrecking ball poke leg holes and arm holes in a black plastic trash bag PERIOD Fill the garbage bag with objects like pillows or blankets that will help you to appear round and then cinch the bag around your neck not too tight of course PERIOD Get a chunky grey plastic chain from Menards and wear it around your neck PERIOD On Halloween night have the person dressed as Miley ride around on piggyback on the person being the wrecking ball with both warbling the chorus to the song as loudly as possible PERIOD The person playing Miley should work up a few lovesick tears for authenticity PERIOD

The Royal Baby

The whole world collectively awwed when Prince George of Cambridge was born this summer PERIOD Grab an adultsized onesie or footie pajamas and a massive costume pacifier to pass as a baby PERIOD To make your costume royal cut out a crown from cardboard and spraypaint it gold PERIOD Easy enough Now go around the whole night bragging about your pedigree and demanding that people bow in your presence PERIOD

A character from The Great Gatsby

Whether you enjoyed the movie or not Gatsby costumes are going to be big this Halloween PERIOD For the ladies grab a fringed dress or your favorite LBD and pair it with pearls fishnet tights and a feathered headband PERIOD Wear your hair in a faux bob or a low bun if you dont already have a flapperinspired bob PERIOD Dapper fellows should wear flashy suits and slick back their hair PERIOD Add a pinky signet ring and a boutonniere for true authenticity PERIOD

Group costume boy bands past their prime

While we all screamed like fangirls when NSYNC reunited at the  VMAs we failed to notice that the group is a little past its prime PERIOD And did you know that the Backstreet Boys formed  years ago This should make you feel old PERIOD This year channel your favorite boy bands with a ribbed tank top chains and baggy cargo pants while adding geriatric accessories like temporary gray hairspray fake glasses drawnon wrinkles and a cane PERIOD Bonus points if you can wrangle up a few handsfree microphones  you can also try making some out of pipe cleaners and aluminum foil

Great places to find resources for all these costumes and more are secondhand stores downtown and Ragstock PERIOD Borrowing from friends is also a great way to make a costume on the cheap PERIOD

So there you have it PERIOD Now you really have no excuse not to dress up this Halloween",Halloween costume trends reflect this years biggest fads â€“ The Olaf Messenger,St. Olaf College
