2207,2022-03-16,"so George Will does his best to skewer Senatorelect Jim Webb in the Post today PERIOD While I admire Will as a writer I cant stand him as a pundit PERIOD The collapse of his beloved conservative revolution has left him arguing style instead of substance PERIOD Instead of attacking Webbs assertion that Americans are living in an age of unprecedented economic inequality he attacks Webb for how he says it PERIOD I think anyone including Webb who writes an oped in a national publication cannot expect anything less than wideranging criticism but I wonder whether Will is attacking Webb on semantics simply because he cant attack him on substance.In regards to Will commenting on Webbs rudeness I understand what Will is complaining about a lack of civility PERIOD But I also wonder why anyone of us who do not have a loved one serving in Iraq think they can tell a parent how to behave or conduct themselves when talking about the subject PERIOD One would think we might be understanding of a father who is worried about his son PERIOD
