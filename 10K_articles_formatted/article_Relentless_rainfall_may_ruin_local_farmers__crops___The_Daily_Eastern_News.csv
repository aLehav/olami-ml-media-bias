Tropical Storm Bill along with rain early last week caused water to puddle up onto already saturated ground which could be devastating to local farmers crops PERIOD

According to the National Weather Service Tropical Storm Billformed from a disturbance that was tracked from near Honduras on June  into the Gulf of Mexico a couple of days later PERIOD

Bill transitioned into a posttropical cyclone on June  over eastern Kentucky and although it brought coastal flooding and gusty winds to the Texas coast its primary impact was rainfall flooding according to NWS PERIOD

Mark Degler a Coles County farmer said he lost about  percent of his acres to ponding water from the persistent rainfall last week PERIOD

We had substantial flooding Degler said PERIOD

Despite having tile over much of his farmland which removes excess water the  inches of rain he received overloaded some of the tiling on his fields PERIOD

This caused ponding which can leach nitrogen away from corn and kill crops if left under water for several days PERIOD

There is good drainage around here but theres no way to deal with that much rain Degler said PERIOD

He is concerned about all the flooding but also saidthis probably will not have a big impact at the end of the season PERIOD

Paul Daily owner of Daily Feed and Seed and a Coles County farmer said he lost about  acres of corn and  acres of soybeans PERIOD

Tropical storms are usually great in the summer but this one came too early Daily said PERIOD

A creek overflowed near Dailys fields which made any tiling in his fields useless PERIOD

Even for Dailys crops that were not killed nitrogen was leached from the ground which can be noticed by the crops showing a light green to yellow color PERIOD

Daily said this early flooding may cause corn roots to not grow as deep as they normally would which can worsen any droughts later on in the season PERIOD

Degler and Daily both agree that it is late in the season to replant any crops PERIOD

Daily said he could plant beans again but he only has about two weeks to get the new crop planted PERIOD Considering that the ground is already saturated planting again isnt a great option this late in the season PERIOD

Daily said flooding in Indiana was even worse than in Coles County PERIOD Many farmers in southern Illinois were also never able to plant soybeans presenting an additional  million bushel deficit PERIOD This can affect nationwide prices of crops PERIOD

Currentlya bushel of corn is . and a bushel of soybeans is . according to NASDAQ PERIOD

Despite the flooding Daily said corn and soybeans can come back from floods like this PERIOD

You can count them out until theyre dead he said PERIOD
