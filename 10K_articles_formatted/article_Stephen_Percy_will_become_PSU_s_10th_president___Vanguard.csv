8747,2020-06-02,"watching the special Board of Trustees meeting on May  over a computer screen watching grainy video and professionals forget to unmute themselves it was one of plenty things at Portland State to change in the midst of the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD



The Board was determined to keep one thing the same however PSUs president PERIOD



With a unanimous vote by the BOT Stephen Percy will become PSUs tenth president PERIOD



In the last year Dr PERIOD Percy has shown strong leadership stated committee chair Greg Hinckley and vice chair Margaret Kirkpatrick in a BOT announcement His work guiding PSUs transition to a virtual campus in such a short time period is the latest example of his effectiveness and dedication leading this campus PERIOD Dr PERIOD Percy has done an admirable job in leading the university during a difficult time in its history and he has demonstrated he has a keen understanding of our students and community. after the Executive and Audit Committee of the BOT announced its recommendation of Percy to the full board on May  an online survey was put out to the greater campus community PERIOD According to Hinkley and Kirkpatricks announcement about  of approximately  respondents supported appointing Percy to the president position PERIOD Percy also received support from the Faculty Senate the PSU foundation Associated Students of PSU ASPSU and the four employee unions PERIOD



After the resolution was passed Percy was given the chance to address the Board in the remaining minutes of the meeting PERIOD



I just want to say its been an honor to serve as the interim president of PSU over the past year Percy said PERIOD We must identify and take strategic actions consistent with our mission and values to strengthen PSU in this area of great change in higher education PERIOD I should really appreciate your support and pledge my full energy and spirit to work with the board of trustees to advance PSU PERIOD Im so optimistic about the future and I want to thank the BOT. direct appointments such as Percys are uncommon but not undoable PERIOD Typically the search for a new president would be much lengthier including the creation of a presidential search committee that consists of representatives from the PSU community and at least one other public university presidentexcept in the case of an interim or acting president in which a search committee is not required PERIOD The BOT announced in Fall  it would defer starting its search to Spring  PERIOD Then the pandemic happened PERIOD



According to its bylaws the BOTalong with the governor or a standin appointed by the governoralways has the authority to appoint the president and may do so directly PERIOD Hinkley cited the COVID19 pandemic and the difficulties it caused for meetings and travel as the main reason why the Board chose the direct appointment PERIOD



We realized that a traditional search including external candidates would probably be close to impossible or if it was possible would take two or more years to conclude Hinkley said PERIOD In this environment we needed somebody in charge with the title of president. percy was first named as acting president on May   following the resignation of former PSU president Rahmat Shoureshi PERIOD He was officially appointed to the position at the following BOT meeting on May  by a unanimous vote PERIOD Prior to accepting the position Percy was dean of the College of Urban and Public Affairs PERIOD



A committee later was formed to search for an interim president PERIOD At a special June  meeting Percy was unanimously appointed to the position and would remain as interim president until a permanent president could be found PERIOD



Ive had a lot of leadership experience but the presidential level is different Percy said PERIOD As we got into it and as we worked through some challenges and moved forward I found I enjoyed it PERIOD I thought wed built a strong leadership team I began to have more ideas about what I think my contributions to the university would be and the value I bring to itI didnt start out for sure that I would be interested. while the BOT approved the resolution Percy will not officially transition to the role of president until the completion of an employment agreement PERIOD While the contract isnt finished and will continue to be negotiated certain guidelines have already been released by the BOT His compensation wont exceed the median of similar institutions or provide allowances for housing and travel PERIOD The contract will also define goals for the president and establish metrics to measure his progress towards them PERIOD



The agreement is expected to stipulate that the appointment since it was done directly by the board with a less involved process lasts for three years a limit that isnt typically applied to university presidents PERIOD



It was quite important to have a term more limited than normal to look and see how its going and then make a decision where they go after that and Im very comfortable with that in this situation Percy said PERIOD



Percys first email announcement since becoming president addressed the deaths of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery calling for justice and insisting that justice and equity would be a core part of PSU PERIOD



We must deepen our work to make our community one where justice and equity are central to who we are Percy stated PERIOD We must work towards equity and justice at Portland State in Portland in Oregon in America and across the world PERIOD It will take intentional and collective action to dismantle systemic structures of oppression PERIOD Today and always black lives matter. pSU faces a number of difficult situations in the coming months including decreasing enrollment and adapting to the coronavirus pandemic both of which are adding additional strain on the universitys revenue and budget PERIOD In his upcoming position as president Percy will be at the head of handling these issues PERIOD



We need creative and bold new approaches and new types of solutions to deal with the challenges were facing today Percy said PERIOD This is a time of opportunity that we must embrace PERIOD This is a challenging timeweve all been through it but also disruptions unleash creativity and energy and innovative spirit we havent seen for a long time PERIOD We must take advantage of that. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
