The president of an engineering club at UNF literallystood up for what he believed PERIOD Starting the Society of Automotive Engineers club at UNF and having a goal for the club to build a race car to compete with in a years time PERIOD

During his second semester at UNF he stood up and pitched the idea to a bunch of people on the first day of class and they were really interested said JustinTussey a mechanical engineering junior and president of UNFs chapter of the society PERIOD

That is how he found vice president Peter Cerreta and they have been going full steam for about the past three months trying to make it happen Tussey said PERIOD

Tussey Cerreta and about  more engineering students from UNF are trying to build a formula series race car which can reach upward to  miles per hourusing a motorcycle engine in order to compete with other college engineering programs all throughout the country PERIOD The car is set to be completed by May   butTusseysaid theyre trying to get a head start by starting as early as possible PERIOD This will be the clubs second week PERIOD

A lot of teams suffer from not organizing properly so theyre doing last minute things like putting the paint on the car on the way to Michigan he said PERIOD I dont want to be that team. in BrooklynMich PERIOD eachMaythe society hosts a competition called the Formula Design Series where several university chapters of the organization travel to race their cars against each other PERIOD

The UNF chapter will be attending the event this year but not too competeTusseysaid PERIOD Because this is their first year as an official club they wanted to go as spectators so they can have a heads up of what things will be like when theyre ready to compete next spring PERIOD

In order to do well in Michigan were going to need the technical tools along with the knowhow said Cerreta who is also mechanical engineering junior PERIOD Were going to need a strong digital design and skilled machinists for the car PERIOD Were also trying to find a garage to work in. they also have to raise the money needed to build a formula series race car PERIOD One of these cars can cost anywhere between  and  to produceTussey said PERIOD

The UNF club developed a sponsorship packet and campaign letters over Spring Break to send to national companies in order to gain funding PERIOD Theyre planning to ask all the big car companies like Ford GM and Chevrolet for supportTusseysaid PERIOD

But once they are able to get the necessary funds the engineering students still face a long process of designing and building the car for competition PERIOD

The process is you design your car on the computer and then you build the physical carTusseysaid PERIOD And the way you start is with your suspension and then based on that you will have points on a three dimensional space and that will be the outline of your body. the UNF students are hoping to have the skeleton of the car designed by the end of the summer and theyre not expecting to run into any trouble with the build PERIOD

The hard part isnt building the carTusseysaid PERIOD That part comes easy to the engineers PERIOD The hard part is keeping people who have to keep up with schoolwork involved and dedicated. but for those who really love cars the reasons to stay involved are obvious PERIOD

Evan Hathaway a mechanical engineering junior who joined the club said even though he thinks getting a job in the automotive industry would be great he joined the club for the fun of it PERIOD

I love cars Hathaway said PERIOD Its pretty exciting that were actually going to be building a car and its a huge resume builder PERIOD People get hired on the spot when they see we have experience outside theclassroom like this. this is also a brand new experience for UNFstudentsaltogether PERIOD

WhenTusseytransferred from UCF he was disappointed the society didnt have a chapter in Jacksonville PERIOD He always hoped he would have an opportunity to build a race car and now that hope is turning into a reality PERIOD

Im amazed were building a race car Cerreta said PERIOD No one at UNF has ever done this before. uNFs  StudentRun News Source

Very interesting article PERIOD  Would have been nice to have included the picture in the Spinaker and also some discussion about the need for sponsorship from industry and the community PERIOD",Automotive engineers set sights race car construction - UNF Spinnaker,University of North Florida
