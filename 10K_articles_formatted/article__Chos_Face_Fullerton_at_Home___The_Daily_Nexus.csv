4167,2011-01-21,"coming off a disappointing  loss at the hands of Riverside UCSB womens basketball is looking to rebound in a big way when they take on Cal State Fullerton on Saturday at the Thunderdome PERIOD

mediacredit id16616 alignalignleft width250mediacreditLast Saturdays loss dropped the Gauchos record to   Big West while the Titans last win over Long Beach State on Wednesday brought their record to   Big West PERIOD UCSB has come out victorious in the last  games against Fullerton and leads the overall match up  PERIOD

They are a very good team and they deny everything senior forward Mekia Valentine said PERIOD They take a lot of risks by going for steals PERIOD It is very key that we value the ball this time around because they are very quick. fullertons duo of junior guard Megan Richardson and senior guard Lyndsey Grove lead the Titans attack combining to average over  points per game PERIOD Each is deadly from the outside as well as both sit in the top  in the league for threepoint field goal percentage PERIOD

Fullerton plays a fourguard offense and they have really good shooters Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb said PERIOD They run a lot of screens to get their open shots PERIOD Richardson is probably the best in the league in terms of outside shooting. with the Gauchos secondranked defense in terms of opponent point production the game figures to be a battle of two different styles of play PERIOD To stay with the Titans UCSB will have to use its size to control the glass PERIOD

We need to establish an inside game that is their one vulnerability Gottlieb said PERIOD We also need to handle pressure and allow our guards to get to the basket PERIOD We have to make it tough for them to score by getting off the screens quickly challenging the shot and doing a good job on defense. collectively we need to come together and take it to another level junior guard Emilie Johnson said PERIOD We need to handle pressure better take care to the ball and not commit turnovers PERIOD Similar to Riverside they are a pressure team defensively PERIOD We will be prepared on Saturday and will be ready for their pressure. johnson went scoreless on Saturday against Riverside but dropped  in the teams previous game against Irvine PERIOD She leads the Gauchos in scoring with over  points per game PERIOD Valentine meanwhile nearly averages a doubledouble with nine points and over nine rebounds per game PERIOD Both are looking for a better performance from the team on Saturday than they saw against Riverside PERIOD

Everybody has their pride and no one likes to lose by  Johnson said PERIOD I think we are all fired up to rebound from it PERIOD We know thats not how we play basketball here as Gauchos PERIOD We need to hold ourselves accountable to certain standards and that was way below our expectations. the Gauchos are currently in a fourway tie for second place in the Big West with  games remaining on the Big West schedule PERIOD The Titans sit in sixth place but have won their previous two games and are eager to take advantage of any Gaucho struggles PERIOD

After the Irvine game I was saying that at this point in the season it really comes down to the little stuff Valentine said PERIOD The team that can take care of the little things such as turnovers free throws and all that stuff is the team that will come out on top. tipoff against Fullerton is scheduled for  p.m PERIOD in the Thunderdome PERIOD
