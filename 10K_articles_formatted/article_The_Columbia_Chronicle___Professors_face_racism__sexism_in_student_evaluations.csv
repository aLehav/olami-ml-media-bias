Updated  at  a.m PERIOD with additional comments from Elio Leturia

When students fill out evaluations of professors at the end of each semester their feedback weighs into decisions affecting that professors employment status and financial earnings PERIOD Often though evaluations are biased against female instructors and instructors of color PERIOD

One former Columbia instructor in the Cinema and Television Arts Department is suing the college because he alleges biased student evaluations played a key role in his termination PERIOD

Professors on the tenure track are evaluated multiple times and then again when the department decides whether they will receive tenure PERIOD When deciding their employment status Faculty Senate President Sean Johnson Andrews an associate professor in the Humanities History and Social Sciences Department said instructors are evaluated based on teaching scholarship and service with student evaluations playing a critical role in the teaching category PERIOD

Vaun Monroe a black former tenuretrack professor in the thenFilm and Video Department now titled the Cinema and Television Arts Department taught a handful of classes on the intersection of performance and race during his time at Columbia from  to  PERIOD

Currently Monroe is the executive director of the Nate Parker Film and Theatre Conservatory and caucus chair of Diversity and Inclusion for the University Film and Video Association at Wiley College in Marshall Texas PERIOD

Monroe is suing Columbia and Bruce Sheridan a professor in the Cinema and Television Arts Department for racial discrimination against him which ultimately resulted in his  termination the suit alleges as reported by the Chronicle Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

In  Monroe discovered a student created a website Black Supremacy Now with a Photo of the Beast that featured a photo of Monroe with vile racist screeds aimed at him PERIOD The suit alleges no action on Sheridan or Columbias part was taken against the student who was ultimately permitted to fill out an evaluation of Monroe at the end of the semester PERIOD

Additionally some students in Monroes Adaptation film course disliked extensively discussing race in the classroom PERIOD One student wrote in their evaluation We spent far too long nearly every week talking about issues of race while another student wrote If I wanted to take a class about African Americans and Film I will sic sign up for it the lawsuit alleges PERIOD

Those evaluations were then used during Monroes evaluation meeting after his first year teaching at Columbia with Sheridan who was the department chair at the time PERIOD Monroe alleges Sheridan belittled and dismissed his explanation of biased evaluations during the meeting and that Sheridan said he was not assuming responsibility for his classroom and playing the race card according to Monroes lawsuit PERIOD

After a failed first attempt at recommending Monroes termination in  during his first tenure hearing Sheridan again recommended Monroes termination in  this time successfully the suit alleges PERIOD

Sheridan declined to comment PERIOD

The college is aware that Mr PERIOD Monroe was displeased with the outcome of his employment at Columbia but there is no evidence to support his allegations of discrimination said Lambrini Lukidis assistant vice president of Strategic Communications and External Relations in an Aug PERIOD  email statement to the Chronicle PERIOD The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission conducted an investigation and concluded there was no reasonable cause to support his allegations of discrimination. filed Aug PERIOD   the lawsuit is currently awaiting a judges ruling on Columbias motion for summary judgment before potentially going to trial no earlier than fall  Monroes attorney Tom Rosenwein said PERIOD

The American Association of University Professors sent a letter to President and CEO KwangWu Kim in  concerning Monroes tenure case according to AAUPs Associate Secretary Anita Levy PERIOD It recommended Columbia amend its Faculty Manual to include a policy allowing faculty members to appeal employment decisions based on discrimination and urged the college to reevaluate Monroes case through a hearing in front of a faculty committee PERIOD

Levy said the impermissible inconsiderations Monroe faced in the tenure decision caused the AAUP to reach out PERIOD

To Levys knowledge neither an amendment nor reevaluation occurred PERIOD

Student evaluations play an important role posttenure as well PERIOD

When considering raises for faculty Johnson Andrews said the college uses a meritbased point system where raises are given to the best faculty using student evaluations PERIOD

Because inherently flawed student evaluations are used in making tenure and raise decisions Johnson Andrews said it is possible the evaluations have also contributed to a pay parity issue at the college although this cannot be said definitively as data on professorial salaries are not public knowledge as Columbia is a private institution PERIOD

In response to this issue the Faculty Senate is creating a task force to recommend teaching evaluation changes by the end of the academic year to Senior Vice President and Provost Marcella David as she examines disparities at the college Johnson Andrews said PERIOD

In my experience  quite a few women and people of color  just get fed up with the environment and the problems and they just go away PERIOD But I believe the current provost is trying to address this Johnson Andrews said PERIOD

Monroes experiences are not unique at Columbia PERIOD

Elio Leturia associate professor in the Communication Department has always thrived in the service and scholarship categories but has never managed to flourish in the teaching category because of poor evaluations which may be because of his strict teaching style he said PERIOD

Around five years ago Leturia who has a Peruvian accent had a student tell him in an evaluation to get a speech therapist PERIOD Since then he asks students to ask him for clarification if his accent makes anything seem unclear PERIOD

It is very unfair because no matter how hard I work how much effort I make how available I am  I always get poor evaluations in terms of teaching Leturia said PERIOD I just want that disadvantage to be acknowledged PERIOD I know I have to work harder than my colleagues. leturia said he received significantly better teaching evaluations in an online course because students are not biased by inperson aspects of teaching PERIOD

Although Leturia said DEI initiatives do a good job addressing bias at faculty and administrator levels it also needs to recognize bias at the student level PERIOD

I do the best that I can but I know I have no control Leturia said PERIOD I like teaching PERIOD  The greatest pleasure is when you see one of your students succeeding and seeing whatever you were part of in that experience you contributed a little PERIOD That is the best satisfaction you can have PERIOD Thats why I stay. the Communications of the Association of Computing Machinery the Public Library of Science peerreviewed journal the Journal of Higher Education the Assessment  Evaluation in Higher Education and Higher Learning Research Communications have all published academic research concluding there is at least some bias based on race and gender in student evaluations PERIOD

Robert Hanserd assistant professor in the Humanities History and Social Sciences Department said it is the evaluation approach itself that is biased problematic and lopsided as students who do not participate at all in class are still able to evaluate professors PERIOD

Hanserd said evaluations should play a factor in hiring and raise decisions but should be weighed equivalently with other components PERIOD

The DEI initiatives that are really trying to get folks to think better about curriculum part of that process  should encourage faculty to start to develop their own evaluations around what theyre teaching evaluations that encourage students to be more honest about participation or lack thereof in the classroom Hanserd said PERIOD

Kathie Bergquist adjunct professor in the English and Creative Writing Department has experienced biased student interactions PERIOD Bergquist said oftentimes students enter the classroom with presumptions of an instructor based on their gender sexuality or race and when those stereotypes are not met they may take it out on the professor PERIOD

Early in her professorial career she noticed a comment on Rate My Professor a public evaluation website from an anonymous student that personally attacked her for her physical appearance PERIOD She strongly suspected it was a student whom she would not allow to eat a Subway sandwich during class PERIOD She had to request the comments be taken down as they did not evaluate her teaching PERIOD

Still student evaluations have an important role for instructors looking for feedback on how to become a better teacher and for weeding out problematic professors she said PERIOD However Bergquist added professors should have an opportunity to defend themselves against discriminatory student evaluations before they affect their employment PERIOD

Johnson Andrews added that Monroes ongoing lawsuit can also encourage the college and inspire faculty to take action against biased evaluations PERIOD

As the national conversation on recognizing bias ramps up Raquel Monroecodirector of the Academic Diversity Equity and Inclusion office and associate professor in the Dance Departmentsaid evaluations are beginning to lose weight in some tenure decisions PERIOD

When she first became a graduate student instructor Raquel Monroe said evaluations from her students would say they were intimidated and afraid of her but later discovered she was cool. these comments tend to continue today for her despite a majority of positive feedback PERIOD

However students also criticize the academic discussion on the intersection of racism sexism and homophobia in her course curriculum by challenging the academic research she presents as opinionated and suggest separating black artistry into a different course PERIOD

Students say that the course should be renamed  Black Dance History as opposed to Dance History because Ive included more African American choreographers and choreographers of color  whereas when I taught a course without that information no one ever thought it should be referred to as White Dance History Raquel Monroe said PERIOD

Biased evaluations can weigh on an instructors psyche because it criticizes them based on predispositions not on their teaching style which is what the evaluations are meant for Raquel Monroe said PERIOD Knowing she should include more visuals for visual learners is far more helpful than knowing she is intimidating upon first meeting she said PERIOD

Raquel Monroe added that some female faculty members of color will have their colleagues read through evaluations and then select the most useful ones for them to view PERIOD

Student Government Association President Kierah King a senior dance major said many students do not know how important evaluations are for professors which is why students need to take more time and consideration when filling them out and why evaluations should not be used in tenure and raise decisions PERIOD

Growing with faculty and hearing how much evaluations truly do affect what they do their work and how they evaluate their classes and even change and shift their classes going to the next year Ive come to realize how much evaluations really do affect and change a faculty professors classes King said PERIOD Telling students how important evaluations are were affecting our curriculum our community as well as generations to come. jackie Spinner an associate professor in the Communication Department said even from a students perspective the evaluation process is flawed as they occur at the end of the semester when students have already endured a professor PERIOD

We shouldnt wait until the end of the semester when students have already spent all their money and invested all that time in a course to figure out theres a problem with a professor Spinner said PERIOD We should be monitoring throughout the semester PERIOD We should be giving students an avenue for feedback before the end of the semester so were able to pivot. spinner said teaching critiques are based off cultural stigmas PERIOD She knows she would be perceived differently as a male instructor without having to change her teaching style because of the bh cultural stigma surrounding assertive demanding women she said PERIOD

As the college attempts to be a leader in DEI initiatives and under the helm of a new provost Spinner said the college needs to look for solutions to the evaluation process and take the weight of them out from tenure and raise decisions PERIOD

It shouldnt matter if Ive been directly impacted by the bias I still feel a responsibility to my colleagues to stand up against this Spinner said PERIOD Its horrible theyre racist theyre sexist PERIOD The evidence shows that and the college wont confront that PERIOD  Were spending so much energy trying to get rid of the bias in our institution and we have not had the courage yet to just reject student evaluations  as biased. the Columbia Chronicle  Copyright   FLEX WordPress Theme by SNO  Log in","The Columbia Chronicle | Professors face racism, sexism in student evaluations",Columbia College Chicago
