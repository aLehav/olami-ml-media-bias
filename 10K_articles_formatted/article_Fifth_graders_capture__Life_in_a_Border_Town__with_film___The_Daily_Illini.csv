This year over  communities are participating in the organizations effort said Emily Love an outreach librarian for multicultural service PERIOD Each community was given  culturally diverse books to choose from PERIOD

The Big Read answers a big need Love said PERIOD In ChampaignUrbana this is now our third year with The Big Read. the opening of the exhibit was the kickoffs center feature PERIOD Given three weeks fifth graders of the Felipe Carillo Puerto primary school were provided with  disposable cameras to capture moments of their lives in the border city of Reynosa McAllen Texas PERIOD



We gave them a list of things that we would like to take a picture of said Jonathan Searfoss one of the project founders PERIOD Some kids followed it religiously some ignored it completely but the results are amazing. the children returned over  photographs of which  are on display at the Universitys exhibit PERIOD Searfoss and David Freeman the project founders were both present at the opening PERIOD They said they lived an extended amount of time in a U.S.Mexico border town from which stemmed their inspiration for the project PERIOD

We decided that our unique position allowed us to give a unique perspective Searfoss said PERIOD Searfoss said fifth graders were integral to the project because of their different outlook on the world PERIOD

Theyre not quite old enough to understand that there are bad things out there and theyre young enough to have an innocent view Searfoss added PERIOD

Freeman said he agreed with Searfoss in that the role the children played in the project was significant PERIOD

They capture so many of the things that I think an adult misses Freeman said PERIOD Their vision and what they captured is so fresh. the University is undertaking a similar project in collaboration with other schools near the district including Booker T PERIOD Washington School and Champaign Central High School PERIOD

We will have them capture pictures of their lives here in a Midwest town and compare and contrast Love said PERIOD",Fifth graders capture ‘Life in a Border Town’ with film - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
