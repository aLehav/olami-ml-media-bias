December  

As junior setter Alexis Viliunas lay at midcourt beneath the net the Illini faithful in attendance at the Hilton Coliseum let out a collective gasp PERIOD

The fans fellow Illini players and coaches knew what was at stake as Viliunas winced in pain PERIOD Illinois season hung in the balance PERIOD

While Viliunas returned later in the set and led the Illini with  assists her highest total in the tournament her effort wouldnt be enough PERIOD The No PERIOD  Illini dropped their NCAA Tournament Sweet  match to No PERIOD  Florida in five sets PERIOD

With Illinois up  in the second set Viliunas went up to block and came down on a Florida outside hitter rolling her ankle PERIOD Illinois won the point but lost the quarterback of its team in the process PERIOD

After grabbing at her knee as she lay on the court Viliunas left the court on her feet with the help of head coach Kevin Hambly and the Illinois trainer PERIOD To junior outside hitter Jocelynn Birks the fact that Viliunas walked off the court was a big relief PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

I thought it was her knee at first so I was obviously worried about her Birks said PERIOD Then she got up and walked I was like okay. hambly quickly tried to shuffle his lineup and insert sophomore setter McKenna Kelsay into Viliunas spot but was forced to call a timeout PERIOD

Without Viliunas the Illini looked out of place PERIOD Florida took advantage with a  run to bring the score of the second set to  PERIOD The Gators had already taken the first set

After realizing the injury wasnt as serious as was initially thought Viliunas mind jumped to returning to the court PERIOD

I got into the training room with Randy and I was like I have to get back out there Viliunas said PERIOD Whatever I have to do I have to get back out there. after having her ankles retaped thats exactly what Viliunas did PERIOD

The Illini fans began to cheer PERIOD as Viliunas jogged back onto the court and took a seat between the Illinois coaches PERIOD She flashed thumbs up to Hambly and subbed back into the match PERIOD

The difference was noticeable PERIOD Viliunas garnered an assist on a Birks kill and tallied a kill of her own later in the set PERIOD After coming back into the match Viliunas assisted on eight of Illinois final  points to help the Illini take the second set  PERIOD

It did help Lex Hambly said PERIOD She relaxed PERIOD She was a little bit tense PERIOD

I thought she came back and played better than she did before the injury. illinois capitalized on its momentum taking the third set by a score of  as Viliunas continued to play well PERIOD Viliunas added  more assists in the third set including a tricky set to Birks while sliding on her knees PERIOD

Viliunas would finish with an additional  kills in the final two sets of the match and add  digs with two blocks PERIOD Despite Viliunass return he Illini dropped the final two sets to the Gators en route to the loss PERIOD

Although Hambly didnt think Viliunas earlymatch injury had any direct bearing on the outcome of the match he said the team had to deal with a lot of adversity and that it handled it well throughout the match PERIOD

The team did a great job of continuing to fight Hambly said PERIOD
