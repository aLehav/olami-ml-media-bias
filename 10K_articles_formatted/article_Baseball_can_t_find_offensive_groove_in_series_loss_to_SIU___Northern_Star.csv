By  Matt BoeckerMarch  

DeKALB  Baseballs offensive struggles put it on the wrong side of a series sweep by the Southern Illinois UniversityCarbondale Salukis over the weekend PERIOD

After showing consistency in hits this season the Huskies could only muster up four runs in Carbondale PERIOD

SIU did a good job of pounding the strike zone and keeping our hitters off balance all weekend Head Coach Mike Kunigonis said PERIOD We need to make better adjustments in game from atbat to atbat. game One

It was a pitching duel in the series opener Friday that saw the Huskies lose  in  innings PERIOD

Each starting pitcher turned out dominant performances that set the tone for the game PERIOD NIU junior starting pitcher Michael Lasiewicz tossed five innings allowing only a run on six hits and three walks while striking out six Salukis PERIOD SIU senior starting pitcher Mason Hiser lasted six innings allowing a run on five hits and a walk while striking out six Huskies PERIOD

The lone NIU run came in the third inning when sophomore designated hitter Nick Drobushevich launched a home run to break the scoreless tie PERIOD SIUs run came in the fifth inning when a sacrifice fly knotted the game at one apiece PERIOD

Each teams bullpen picked up where its starters left off by continuing to keep its opposition off the board PERIOD

The game would require extra innings and ended in the tenth when SIU scored a run off fielders choice to give the Salukis game one PERIOD

Game Two

The bats were a bit more active for each team on Saturday afternoon PERIOD

NIU didnt score until the ninth inning but still had a chance to win until another walkoff fielders choice gave the Salukis the win  PERIOD

SIU broke the ice in the third inning scoring a run off a fielders choice PERIOD Two innings later another fielders choice put the Salukis up  PERIOD

SIU pitching dominated the Huskies for the first eight innings PERIOD SIU senior starting pitcher Brad Harrison pitched well throwing five innings and allowing only five baserunners and striking out three PERIOD Sophomore relief pitcher Matthew Steidl kept things rolling for the Salukis until the ninth inning hit PERIOD

A threerun bomb from senior shortstop Dylan Lonteen put the Huskies up  with only a halfinning left to play PERIOD

Unfortunately for the Huskies their bullpen couldnt get the job done PERIOD An SIU single tied the game at  PERIOD Then a fielders choice clinched the win and the series win for the Salukis PERIOD

One of the best things about this group of guys is they never give up and keep fighting until the end Kunigonis said PERIOD It was disappointing we couldnt pull that one out PERIOD It had the makings to be a great win. game Three

NIU couldnt get things back on track Sunday in its third straight loss to the Salukis PERIOD The  loss clinched the sweep for SIU handing NIU its first series loss since opening the season against Boston College University PERIOD

The Huskies once again struggled getting their offense into gear PERIOD

SIU firstyear starting pitcher Mitchell Jackson tossed the first . innings for the Salukis allowing only three hits and two walks while striking out three PERIOD Senior pitcher Dylan Givens then stepped in and continued frustrating Huskie hitters PERIOD Givens pitched the final . innings of the game allowing only three hits and two strikeouts PERIOD

NIU will hit the road for a pair of games Tuesday and Wednesday against the University of Missouri in Columbia PERIOD First pitch is  p.m PERIOD Tuesday PERIOD
