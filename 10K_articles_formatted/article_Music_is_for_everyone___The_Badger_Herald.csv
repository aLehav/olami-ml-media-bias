2866,2002-09-13,"lets review PERIOD America has learned the shocking lesson this year that  gasp  the business world is corrupt PERIOD Martha Stewart formerly the Wasp goddess of people with too much free time is now being questioned by congressional investigators for some very unwholesome insider trading PERIOD President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have been dodging questions for weeks on the sketchy skeletons in their corporate closets PERIOD Meanwhile Arthur Anderson seems to have their sticky little fingers in virtually every corporate scandal and the women of Enron are posing in Playboy because theyre out of a job PERIOD
But as all this corruption dominates the national spotlight an entirely different economic destroyer is able to lurk undetected in the shadows PERIOD Corruption does a nice job of distracting attention away from the ageold corporate blight of stupidity PERIOD Nothing except for lying to shareholders and stealing their money is more damaging to a company than stupidity PERIOD And nobody is as unequivocally ignorant as the music industry PERIOD
Right now in big blinking letters on Sony Musics website are the words Dixie Chicks new album in stores now
The record companies are evidently still clinging to the illusion that consumers will be willing to trek to the store and pay an exorbitant amount of money for an album they can download for free right at home PERIOD Yet despite being painfully aware of their imminent demise the music industry has done virtually nothing to save itself PERIOD
There are people who say music is an ageold form of expression and no price should ever be placed upon it PERIOD Conversely there are people who argue that music is a business artists are products and glory be to capitalism PERIOD Ideological views aside the bottom line is that the way people get their music is changing so rapidly and drastically that it can only be called a revolution PERIOD
You could say it all started in May of  when Northeastern freshman Shawn Fanning founded the Napster online music service PERIOD Two years later the Ninth U.S PERIOD Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Napster violated copyright laws PERIOD
In the end Napster was easy to topple because it had two major weaknesses PERIOD The first is that it was based in the United States PERIOD There are too many copyright laws here to pull off a stunt like music trading PERIOD The second weakness was Napsters central server once it was shut down the whole network fell apart PERIOD
But Gnutella technology has circumnavigated the central server altogether PERIOD Now music fans trade their music directly with each other peer to peer PERIOD With millions of fans sharing music directly with one another P2P programs have created the equivalent of a mammoth international mix tape library PERIOD
As for the problem of U.S PERIOD residence the new P2Ps have solved that as well many major file sharing programs such as KaZaA and Grokster use Fast Track technology which is based in the Netherlands far from Americas jurisdiction PERIOD
Although to say money isnt trading hands in P2P sharing is not entirely accurate PERIOD Instead of record labels getting cash from consumers its now P2P site hosts getting paid by advertising companies PERIOD
Not only do ads popup repeatedly while users are downloading MP3s but the host programs also come with buried software PERIOD Millions of people have downloaded KaZaA and are using it regularly PERIOD What unsuspecting users probably dont realize is KaZaA came with a buried technology from Brilliant Digital Entertainment PERIOD
The Californiabased digital advertising companys software wakes up computers after it has been installed and then requests the owners permission to use that computer to host and distribute other firms content PERIOD In some cases the software may borrow peoples unused processing power to help with complicated computing tasks PERIOD Ultimately the goal of the software is to turn millions of personal computers into nodes in a network controlled by Brilliant PERIOD
Now thats the kind of insidious ingenuity that one would expect from the music industry PERIOD The P2P programs cannot be shut down or controlled PERIOD As the old adage says If you cant beat them join them. obviously evil genius ad firms like Brilliant have taken this advice to heart and are working within the framework of the music revolution to make money PERIOD
The music industry is left on the sidelines loudly whining and still clinging to the hope that people will succumb to their highway robbery and go buy records PERIOD Thats just stupid PERIOD
