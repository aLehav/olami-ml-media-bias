Last Thursday September  all studentrun organizations on campus set up tables around Appian Way to advertise themselves for the Student Involvement Fair PERIOD This includes Greek life sports radio theatre art music student government and all other organizations PERIOD

Firstyear Communications Major Sam Henry started the Rap Cypher club this year and described it as A hip hop based club with influences from any other genres and were gonna meet up and make music. pERIOD Nobody else was doing it I loved doing it in high school Ive been doing it for years I know how to do it so Im gonna do it. henry invited all to join saying If you have any experience with music wanna have fun wanna vibe with us and just join what were doing come on in all are welcome. junior Secondary Education and English Literature Major Michael Costa said Group Theatre is a very welcoming club PERIOD Group Theatre is a studentrun organization it is theatre by and for students PERIOD This is a group that is all for student involvement and its a lot less of a time commitment than the act of main stage shows so if you cant get involved in those this is a good alternative Costa said PERIOD

Costa said he enjoys being in the club PERIOD  It gives opportunity to everyone no matter what your acting ability is and everybody can get involved if theyve done theatre in the past or if its their first experience PERIOD Its really open to everyone PERIOD Its low commitment its a bunch of other students getting together to make art and its what a lot of us enjoy doing Costa said PERIOD

Come make art its fun youve got nothing to lose no judgement PERIOD Come be creative said senior Art Major Atlas Weil president of the Art Collective PERIOD Weil said she enjoys the diversity of the club. i love seeing Art Majors and non Art Majors get excited to make art and learn about it and get involved on campus with art projects Weil said PERIOD

The Rap Cypher Club will be meeting weekly every Friday or Saturday Group Theatre will meet biweekly on Saturdays at  pm PERIOD and the Art Collective will meet every Tuesday at  pm PERIOD
