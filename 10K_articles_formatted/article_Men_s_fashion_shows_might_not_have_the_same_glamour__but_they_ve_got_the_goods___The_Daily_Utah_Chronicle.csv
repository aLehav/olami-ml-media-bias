As a man deeply interested in fashion Ive always felt a striking disconnect between the clothing I gush about and the things I have hanging in my closet PERIOD When models hit the runways each September and February I consistently find myself gawking at the pretty stuff the lucky ladies get to wear PERIOD

RELATED THE FIVE FASHION DOS AND DONTS OF SUNDANCE

The unfortunate truth however is that I look awful in a dress PERIOD Similarly my sausagefingers would utterly disgrace the beauty of any designer handbag PERIOD Ive seen plenty of boys proudly pull off pieces intended for women but my attempts result in a laughable display of wonky hems awkward limbs and an overall silly disposition PERIOD As much as I want the biannual glory of Womens Fashion Week to directly apply to my life boring old mens clothes will always take prominence in my wardrobe PERIOD

Thankfully a couple of weeks before all the hullaballoo commences in New York London Milan and Paris a selection of major labels put out entire collections devoted to the daring fashionable men of the world PERIOD Mens Fashion Week goes largely unnoticed because well fashion is an art and business far too expressive and beautiful for the stereotypical guy to understand PERIOD

This is not to say men dont like fashion PERIOD More and more men are expressing their love for clothes in blogs newspapers magazines and on television PERIOD With a clear focus on the refined details of an ensemble think crisp pressed shirts perfectly tailored blazers monograms and authentic Italian loafers the obsession of the typical man definitely has its perks PERIOD But as much as Id like to say that I care about cufflinks gingham and straightcut jeans I just cant PERIOD

This is why Mens Fashion Week means so much to me PERIOD With a few exceptions the fashion houses that showcase their mens collections in the weeks before Fashion Month triumphantly parade clothing that is delectably artistic and alive PERIOD Creativity bursts through the seams of the clothes stiffening the competition with the womens lines PERIOD

Take Burberry Prorsum for example PERIOD Call me old school but Burberrys high fashion line consistently churns out some of my favorite shows each season PERIOD With a keen understanding of color and texture their incorporation of live music and some of the most dazzling finales in the business it is hard not to walk out of a Burberry Prorsum show or you know away from the computer you streamed it on without feeling buzzed PERIOD I have been surprised by their ability to fashion styles for men on par with their womens collections PERIOD

During their typical presentation at London Fashion Week the label snags a few of the best looks and models from the mens show and effortlessly weaves them into the mix of beautiful womens dresses coats bags jackets and shoes PERIOD These inclusions fit right in with the looks of the ladies of Burberry PERIOD Rather than creating watereddown easily digested ensembles that complement those on the women Burberry Prorsum takes great care to maintain equality between them PERIOD

The label unveiled their mens AutumnWinter  campaign this January PERIOD Christopher Bailey Burberry Prorsums creative director described the collection as classically bohemian. an abundance of suede lined the collection as eclectic colorful and worldly prints jolted the already exquisite ensembles into something fresh and memorable PERIOD Following in Burberrys tradition of spectacular emotional finales the event planners bombed the audience with a dazzling cloud of glimmering confetti PERIOD

Topman Design held a mens fashion show that wooed me in a similar way PERIOD An evocative eccentric ode to the 70s this show delighted in rich furs poofy hair high waists and tight almosttoosmall tops PERIOD Although it pilfered inspiration from the tired stereotype that the 70s have become in the modern age it never seemed cheap or unimaginative PERIOD

A good portion of Mens Week takes place off the catwalk PERIOD I admire Burberry and Topman Design for sending their men down the runway but many labels dont care to put forth the effort to do so because drawing a crowd for it can be difficult PERIOD Balenciaga stuck to a presentation during which the few who were invited observed the clothes on standing not strutting models in a more controlled setting PERIOD The aesthetic of this show perfectly blended the looks that Alexander Wang  the new creative director of Balenciaga  is famous for with the brands wellestablished revered personality PERIOD

It really is a shame that shows like these dont reach wider audiences PERIOD Women take inspiration from mens clothes all the time PERIOD Chanel created an empire on that idea for goodness sake PERIOD The pieces sewn and presented at Mens Fashion Week are calling to be not only adored but also adorned by women everywhere PERIOD Do yourself a favor PERIOD Feed your hungry minds with all the glory that is mens fashion PERIOD
