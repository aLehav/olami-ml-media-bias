A Swifties analysis of  Taylors Version

I deciphered the message its over faots and we all agreed the message was political in nature. uTSA alumnus Drew Galloway said when describing the discovery of vandalism on his car in a police report PERIOD I asked the officer if the crime would be classified as a hate crime and was told it would not because there was no suspect  it would be classified as graffiti instead. four days after this Galloway discovered a large swastika scrawled onto the trunk of his car PERIOD

Galloways partner Martin and their two childrens sense of security was shaken after their car was vandalised with the homophobic slurs and a swastika a response to the crime was the next move PERIOD

The course of action following a hate crime can be obscure PERIOD The trauma of being targeted paired with the general infrequency of hate crimes the latest FBI hatecrime statistic available reported  hate crime incidents in  pose as challenges to finding concrete answers about a response PERIOD



Immediately Galloway reported the vandalism to the San Antonio police PERIOD

While reporting hate crimes can be very difficult emotionally talking with law enforcement authorities is absolutely essential to keeping our community safe from biasbased crimes and discrimination. galloway said PERIOD We cannot allow these acts to spread in our city PERIOD We all  victims protectors and allies  must speak out against these incidents and do everything possible to ensure hate crimes are properly acted upon by law enforcement and elected officials. many targeted attacks are filed as different crimes PERIOD This can be problematic for a victim who wants an accurate report of how they were harmed and what to identify it as PERIOD

For Galloway the two targeted attacks on his personal property was certainly a hate crime PERIOD

I began calling SAPD to inquire about why the crime was not listed as a hate crime PERIOD Each time I was told it was because there was no suspect if a suspect was located the charge of graffiti could be escalated to a hate crime. the crime was not filed as a hate crime until the media became involved PERIOD Galloway said after KENS5 questioned the SAPD the crime immediately escalated into an antihomosexual hate crime PERIOD

Media exposure to the crime was prompted by social media PERIOD Galloway took to Facebook and Twitter to share his experience with his network as well as contact city officials PERIOD

Then came results PERIOD

Councilman Ron Nirenberg and Councilwoman Shirley Gonzales office reached out to him directly PERIOD Several other members of city council responded to him on Twitter PERIOD

The news stations reacted quickly Galloway said PERIOD I called Mayor Ivy Taylors office and our Councilman Mike Gallaghers office directly I spoke with Mayor Taylor in the afternoon but never heard from Councilman Gallagher in either instance. though the SAPD assured Galloway that both crimes would be listed as hate crimes the office of Diversity and Inclusion said both crimes would not fall under the protections of the NonDiscrimination Ordinance PERIOD

This was extremely disappointing Galloway said PERIOD We need the NonDiscrimination Ordinance to protect victims of hate crimes which means strengthening the ordinances scope and reach. in hindsight Galloway discussed possible measures that would have helped him and his family PERIOD

He felt that standardized methods of locally reporting hate crimes such as clearer definitions of hate wordsphrases and symbols would have helped the officers record the the crime accurately PERIOD

We need hate crime data released to the local public in a timely manner Galloway said PERIOD Local open data initiatives and access to aggregated crime SAPD statistics could help the tech community bring some solutions to the table. the FBI analyzes local hate crime reports and releases aggregated data annually PERIOD This information helps identify trends and track hate organizations across the United States PERIOD

Calling for appropriate intervention is critical but grassroot efforts to combat hatecharged crimes in ones own community is equally important PERIOD As Executive Director of MOVE San Antonio Galloway employed his civic knowledge to a cause close to home PERIOD MOVE is scheduled to provide training on a responsible report and if necessary intervention of harassment in ones community PERIOD

MOVE San Antonios training comes at a time of great importance. galloway said PERIOD Reports of hate crimes have skyrocketed since the election. mOVE U Civic Education Series MOVE San Antonio is hosting a Bystander Intervention Training workshop on Dec PERIOD   from    p.m PERIOD in the Bexar Room at UTSA PERIOD They will talk about biasbased discrimination and crimes how to support vulnerable communities and victims of hate acts and how to safely report intervene and deescalate discriminatory threats and acts PERIOD The training will aim to give students and community members practical skills to help protect their neighbors from verbal physical and sexual abuse PERIOD

Young people are champions of vulnerable communities in our city and instrumental in demanding change to protect their classmates friends and neighbors Galloway concluded PERIOD Were the ones we have been waiting for and the time to act is now. independent Student Newspaper for the University of Texas at San Antonio",Local family doesnâ€™t take hate crimes lying down - The Paisano,University of Texas San Antonio
