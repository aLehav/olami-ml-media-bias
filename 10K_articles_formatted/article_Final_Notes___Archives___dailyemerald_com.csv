The first time Loraine McCarthy played a harp for a dying person was in a Springfield Oregon nursing home PERIOD When she arrived the nurses said the patients death wasnt imminent PERIOD He probably had a few weeks left but he had no family was totally alone and extremely afraid PERIOD She walked in with her harp she could see the fear in his eyes PERIOD

McCarthy briefly spoke to the man before asking him to lie back and relax to let the music take him wherever it wanted PERIOD She began to play he began to relax and after awhile when she thought he was asleep she picked up her harp to leave PERIOD I got to the door and he called me back McCarthy says PERIOD I took his hand and he thanked me and said he was so grateful for the music and the relaxing halfhour. he died later that day PERIOD

For almost a decade McCarthy played the harp for the dying as a founding member of Strings of Compassion PERIOD Along with Sister Vivian Ripp McCarthy started the Eugenebased organization in  at Sacred Heart Medical Center at Riverbend PERIOD In the  years since its inception the program has helped more than  men and women PERIOD Using harp and vocal performances Strings of Compassions three paid employees try to offer a space of serenity at a dying patients bedside PERIOD

Their small but important concerts take place five days a week or by appointment PERIOD Depending on the individual patient a vigil as Strings of Compassion refers to each performance may be held only once or every week for a year PERIOD The service is free of charge a patient family member or friend simply requests a vigil by asking a nurse or by calling the hospitals pastoral and spiritual care services PERIOD

Im kind of the mother figure McCarthy says of the program PERIOD During her time at Strings of Compassion McCarthy retired in  she estimates she helped more than  people PERIOD I am kind of the oldest living music thanatologist she adds PERIOD

The field of music thanatology uses vocal and instrumental performances as therapy to fulfill the physical emotional and spiritual needs of the dying PERIOD Using music as medicine relies on the harpist or vocalists knowledge of what people need as their lives end PERIOD Because of this Strings of Compassions music thanatologists tailor each vigil to the specific patient PERIOD They judge the tempo and tone of a performance by observing the patients vital signs like heart rate and body temperature PERIOD By understanding the process of dying music thanatologists hope to create an atmosphere of tranquility love kindness beauty and peace that helps the patient pass on more easily PERIOD

Strings of Compassion has affected the many families and loved ones who have been present at a vigil says Jane Franz a harpist and the programs coordinator since  PERIOD The music ripples out into the community long after the patient has died. sometimes the positive influence of a vigil even helps do away with longheld family tension adds McCarthy PERIOD

I have seen the music create a harmony among all of the family members she says PERIOD Somehow by the end of it they have resolved a lot of issues within themselves PERIOD They are ready to work together PERIOD Its just obvious in the way you see them move together. when it started Strings of Compassion was solely comprised of McCarthy and Ripp PERIOD The two harpists would often play vigils together PERIOD But as demand for their performances grew so did the program which is now offered at Eugenes Sacred Heart Hospice and the PeaceHealth Cottage Grove Medical Center PERIOD In the future Franz hopes to introduce Strings of Compassion to all of the PeaceHealth medical centers as well as to Southwest Medical Center in Vancouver Washington PERIOD

The knowledge needed to be a music thanatologist for Strings of Compassion however doesnt come from simply showing up at the hospital PERIOD McCarthy and Franz both attended college to study music thanatology Franz has since started a music thanatology program at Lane Community College PERIOD Students looking to be certified by the MusicThanatology Association International spend two years finetuning their musical talents and communication skills PERIOD By the end of the program each student serves  hours at various hospitals and hospices working alongside a professional music thanatologist PERIOD

Although education is an important aspect of music thanatology school a necessity and experience invaluable there is no way to prepare for death PERIOD Typically Strings of Compassion receives two types of calls McCarthy says PERIOD The first a processing call often involves patients who need help accepting their situations PERIOD The second an imminent call means you have to go right nowstat get there this person is dying. sometimes however a patient thought to be far from death passes on sooner than expected a lesson illustrated by McCarthys first vigil PERIOD

As the program coordinator for Strings of Compassion Franz faces the presence of death nearly every day PERIOD As a result Franz says death no longer frightens her PERIOD The music vigil is she adds a place where I can give my ego something sacred to do. while playing the harp at a vigil she has witnessed scenes that reinforce her belief in the power of both music thanatology and Strings of Compassion PERIOD

Once Franz played a vigil for a dying mother as the patients adult son and daughter sat by the bed PERIOD Suddenly blood began spilling from the mothers mouth PERIOD The children stood watching while a nurse came in to suction away the blood she explained that it was a common occurrence for the womans illness PERIOD The nurse then called in an aid to help remove the patients hospital gown so she could be cleaned PERIOD

These adult children stood watching as their mothers naked body was cleaned and clothed Franz says PERIOD It was obviously a shock for them. once the nurse left Franz started playing hoping to offer something beautiful in contrast to the medical scene that had just unfolded PERIOD Soon the patients mouth began to pool with blood again PERIOD This time the son no longer stunned stepped quickly to the suction tube and moved to his mothers side PERIOD His sister took the tube and said We can do this. throughout it all music accompanied like a gentle stream of sound soothing and supporting PERIOD During the evening the daughter told Franz Please dont leave us PERIOD Please keep playing PERIOD It makes this bearable. that night with a calm countenance the patient died PERIOD Her children wept Franz recalls PERIOD They said how glad they were and how thankful they were not to be left alone to have the music present throughout. death seems to come in a sterile environment with white walls and patients slowly sinking into hospital beds PERIOD We imagine the hospital food green slop on silver trays nurses in blue uniforms and the sounds of coughing from the next room PERIOD The sheer notion of dying leaves many paralyzed some consider it their biggest fear PERIOD What a lot of us dont realize and what Strings of Compassion musicians try to show is death doesnt have to be like that PERIOD

Franz believes that Strings of Compassion gives life to patients long after theyve died PERIOD Loved ones often speak of their experiences to others in social circles Franz says PERIOD It is not unusual for me to be stopped in a public place by someone who says I recognize you PERIOD You played for my grandmother. moments like these Franz says show her how blessed I am to be able to serve my fellow humans in this way. ethos is a multicultural magazine that elevates the voices of underrepresented people by telling their stories PERIOD
