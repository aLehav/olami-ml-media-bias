Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Darrell HasslerOctober  

Where the Deep Red is bubbling inside me at the very soul of my existence there is only a single way out PERIOD

It is inside everybody PERIOD Waiting to explode into a beautiful catastrophic animal scream of primitivity PERIOD This is a wildness where we bump against the walls and cry in pain and terror PERIOD But afterwards we just laugh out loud and spin faster and faster until we fall down PERIOD Then we laugh louder and louder with more hysterics and everybody can hear us PERIOD

And we want it to be heard because it offers some sort of perfect power which is so easily seen in black and white PERIOD The violence of war the sting of Muhammad Ali naked shrills brothers beating mothers screaming at their children dying from toxic wastes hating the man on the other side of the line PERIOD Its perfect PERIOD Its animal PERIOD

Something about nakedness and challenging the world around you to look and stare is as if there is something incredibly wrong with a body PERIOD Yet all the timesducks alligators chimpanzeesthey walk naked all the time without notice PERIOD They fight PERIOD They scream PERIOD They dont care PERIOD

So sometimes for everybody there is a time to admire the crudeness of it all PERIOD Just hear the drumbeats of the world and dance wildly to a tune coming from your lungs and your nostrils PERIOD Do some pushups PERIOD Cry afterwards PERIOD Hit a tree for effect PERIOD

Pure emotion makes everything very clear in the world PERIOD Science cannot even touch it PERIOD Religion cannot touch it PERIOD In fact God has nothing to do with it PERIOD Pure emotion is a very individual thing PERIOD Only the individual can find it PERIOD Its a matter of taking everything off PERIOD

The rules always put it down PERIOD Probably it is best for all PERIOD But we cannot lose touch with the Deep Red middle we possess because then we forget there is more to us than a brain and a logic class PERIOD Our brains are only a small part PERIOD There are guts slimy and red PERIOD This is real PERIOD The brain really cannot live without them PERIOD

So forget the rules sometimes PERIOD Watch an ape on TV and realize that all along while it fights in a jungle that societal progress can often be a myth PERIOD Progress becomes regress a regress from being a human being PERIOD No use feeling guilty though because we cannot help it PERIOD Like I said we shouldnt help it PERIOD But we need the Deep Red PERIOD

I dont know if there is ever a way to experience the Deep Red perfectly PERIOD It would probably be too dangerous PERIOD High blood pressure and maybe a heart attack would be the result after a long period of it PERIOD

But others claim they have done it PERIOD Maybe under the inducement of a very strong drug but others say they have experienced it PERIOD

So use violence and sex to make it all happen for you PERIOD Just once in your life just so you can tell your wife and your children and your childrens children how it was to feel the soul burst out through every organ of your body PERIOD They will understand though they may never reach it themselves PERIOD Everybody must understand PERIOD They have to PERIOD

Dont be confused or perturbed PERIOD There is no point in even refusing to believe in what you have because that would only be inner oppressionthe type that only comes when you die PERIOD

There is no point in living dead all your life PERIOD Feel the Deep Red once and you will carry it with you forever PERIOD
