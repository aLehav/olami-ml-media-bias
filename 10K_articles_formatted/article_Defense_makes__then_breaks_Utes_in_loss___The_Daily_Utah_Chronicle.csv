423,2023-10-23,"pROVOFor three years offense has taken center stage at the annual matchup between BYU and Utah PERIOD This year it was defense that ruled the states biggest rivalry game.Not that this was any surprise PERIOD
Going into the game BYU ranked No PERIOD  in the country total defense PERIOD Utah was right behind its southern rival at No PERIOD  PERIOD The stat sheet was a direct representation of Cougars defensive performance as BYU held the Utes to  yards of total offensewhich is nearly  yards less than their season average PERIOD Utahs defensive effort was evident in a different way PERIOD
BYU was able to move the ball  yards by the end of the third quarter PERIOD Tailback Harvey Unga had  yards on the ground by himself PERIOD But it was Utahs ability to slow the Cougars once they crossed midfield that enabled the Utes to have a strong showing defensively PERIOD
During the first threeandahalf quarters BYU had five drives inside of Utahs 35yard line including two that went inside Utahs five PERIOD The Utes yielded just three field goals out of those visits PERIOD
I could be more proud of a defense Utah safety Steve Tate said PERIOD Its a tough offense to prepare for PERIOD We just knew that this game was going to come down to third downs and getting out of bad situations and we did that most of the game. it was that Utah defense that also delivered the first blow of the game PERIOD
On BYUs third offensive possession Joe Jiannoni intercepted Max Hall pass at the BYU 16yard line on the first play of the drive to put Utahs offense in the red zone midway through the first quarter PERIOD Utahs offense failed to exchange the turnover for points PERIOD
The Utes didnt have to wait long however to gets its second big defensive play of the quarter PERIOD After a lengthy BYU drive Ute defensive end Martail Burnett stripped Unga of the ball after the Cougars had made it inside the Utah 27yard line PERIOD
Again Utahs offense could not capitalize on the turnover but that didnt stop the resolve of the Ute defense PERIOD
After Johnsons second interception at the  mark in the second quarter gave BYU the ball at the Utah  the Utes defense bent but did not break PERIOD BYU drove the ball to the Utah 4yard line before being forced to settle for a 22yard field goal for the only score of the first half PERIOD
In the second half the Ute defense held BYU to just two more field goals as they patiently waited for Johnson and the Utes offense to capitalize on their defensive stops PERIOD With  remaining a 69yard Utah drive rewarded the defensive effort and gave the team a  lead PERIOD
All the U defense had to do was hold BYU for one final drive PERIOD
On the ensuing firstdown play Burnett forced his second fumble of the game PERIOD BYU quarterback Max Hall recovered leaving BYU with a secondand18 situation PERIOD On second down Dennis Pitta dropped Halls pass leaving BYU with a long thirddown play PERIOD Once again Pitta was Halls target and this time safety Robert Johnson nearly picked off Halls pass setting up a desperation fourthand18 situation for the home team PERIOD In a game that was so heavily dictated by the defenses of both teams all it took was one defensive lapse to change the entire outcome PERIOD
With the Utes in a cover2 scheme the Utah secondary somehow overlooked BYU receiver Austin Collie PERIOD As Hall was flushed from the pocket he found the neglected Collie for a 49yard pass that gave BYU a first down and continued what turned out to be the gamewinning drive PERIOD
It was a tough loss to swallow U head coach Kyle Whittingham said PERIOD Like last year one play way from finishing the deal and we werent able to finish the deal PERIOD Obviously in that cover2 situation youre not suppose to let guys get behind you but it happens.emailprotected

Brian Johnson leaves as BYU fans storm the field at Lavell Edwards Stadium on Saturday PERIOD  After leading  with less than a minute left the Utes fell behind to lose  when BYU rallied to score a touchdown and complete a twopoint conversion PERIOD
