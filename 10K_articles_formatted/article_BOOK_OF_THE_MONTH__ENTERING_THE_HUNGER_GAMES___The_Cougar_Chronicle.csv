Author Suzanne Collins introduces The Hunger Games as the first book to the epic trilogy leaving readers anxious in completing what seems like a neverending story PERIOD

Though the series was first released in  the excitement of seeing the games on the big screen is making the series exceedingly famous PERIOD

The plot unravels when a district rebels causing the Capitol to punish the remaining districts by forcing two teenagers from each of the twelve districts to fight one another in an arena with provided weapons PERIOD As part of entertainment for the public the games are aired live on television PERIOD The winner represents their district as well as receives honor and respect for themselves and family PERIOD Children are entered at the age of twelve and must fight against the other competitors until only one survives PERIOD

The main character Katniss Everdeen is responsible for taking care of her mother and sister and to do so she trespasses outside the fences of District  in order to hunt for food entering the Hunger Games arena and changing her life forever PERIOD The Hunger Games offers friendship love and rebellion all within the first book of the series PERIOD

Collins detailed descriptions of the characters and object in the book are so specific it feels as if the reader is a part of the rebellion PERIOD You will not be able to eat or sleep without knowing what characters Katniss Peeta and Gale will endure next PERIOD The anticipation is unbearable PERIOD

Though another book may seem like a distraction to your homework or obligations once you begin reading the first page putting it down will seem impossible PERIOD Regardless the genres youre most interested in The Hunger Games is by far the best allaround book I have ever read PERIOD
