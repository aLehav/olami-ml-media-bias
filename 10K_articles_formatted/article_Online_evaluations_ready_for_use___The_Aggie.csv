After a successful pilot run during Summer Session II the new Academic Course Evaluation ACE program will begin to replace inclass written evaluations during the  academic year PERIOD
A combination of  lectures discussions and labs were chosen to participate in the ACE online trial this past summer PERIOD In a survey taken by  students enrolled in one of these  courses  percent rated the online evaluations as either the same better or much better than its paper counterpart PERIOD
According to Jeff de Ropp committee cochair and department manager of the Chemical Engineering and Materials Science Department one of the advantages of using ACE is increased staff efficiency PERIOD Another is the streamlining of faculty assessment and promotion since evaluation of merit is already handled online PERIOD
By collecting survey content online ACE reduces the time spent manually distributing collecting and analyzing evaluations PERIOD
It can automatically calculate averages and analyze the data in a variety of ways PERIOD ACE can even export the data in Excel format allowing for personalized analysis of the information by departmental faculty and staff PERIOD
ACE also minimizes human error when copying answers and comments to an electronic file format PERIOD
Eliminating the paper will mean that each students voice is more directly heard said Victoria Cross academic coordinator and lecturer in the Department of Psychology in an email interview PERIOD There wont be any chance that your bubbled answer wasnt bubbled clearly enough. key to ACEs positive response from students is the evaluations shift from an inclass setting to an athome setting PERIOD
Professors sometimes skip over material and tell us we have to learn it at home in order to make time for evaluations PERIOD So I think online evaluations would be easier said secondyear biomedical engineering major Johanna Mattram PERIOD
However making the switch from paper evaluations to the online format is at the discretion of course instructors PERIOD Its a completely voluntary system PERIOD We cant mandate it said de Ropp PERIOD
The general body of research comparing online evaluations to written ones shows that scores remain consistent but student participation decreases when using online systems PERIOD
To compensate automated email reminders were sent out daily to students during the Summer Session II trial PERIOD The reminders began the day evaluations opened and continued until the day students completed the survey PERIOD
In the Chemical Engineering and Materials Science Department this summer online response rates were comparable to those found when using paper evaluations PERIOD However the department sent out reminders in addition to those automatically generated by the system PERIOD
Professors are allowed to set a time limit for their surveys and adjust how long they are available online PERIOD They can even use ACE to set their own evaluative scales PERIOD Similar to paper evaluations the content and number of survey questions are completely in the hands of individual departments and instructors PERIOD
This is unlike online evaluations developed by other UCs PERIOD Some have a central committee that dictates the same questions for use on all surveys PERIOD
Developed by programmers under the Administrative Application Development Initiative at UC Davis ACEs software works by talking to databases that hold information regarding current course rosters PERIOD
Using these systems it restricts survey access to only those students registered for a course PERIOD Students then access the survey using their Kerberos ID PERIOD All survey results however are completely anonymous PERIOD
When a student submits anything all identifying information is stripped away PERIOD The data is stored without any ID de Ropp said PERIOD
In fact ACEs Oversight Committee was created partly to create privacy measures and design the specifications of the software PERIOD The Oversight Committee consists of eight faculty eight staff and four student members PERIOD
Faculty privacy is also protected instructors can view only their results and not those of any other faculty PERIOD Also only staff granted access to ACE by their department chair are allowed to use the system PERIOD
Like traditional written evaluations faculty will not be able to view survey results until after final grades have been submitted PERIOD
ACE was created to maintain the freedom of paper evaluations de Ropp said PERIOD
He hopes students faculty and staff will see this as ACE begins to take the place of more written evaluations this quarter PERIOD
