OU coach Lon Kruger and junior guard Alondes Williams during the game against UTSA Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

Oklahoma  defeated Texas San Antonio   in its season opener Tuesday night in Norman PERIOD

The Roadrunners were a tough early season matchup for the Sooners that return just three players who were major contributors last season PERIOD The teams lone senior forward Kristian Doolittle was out due to a one game penalty for breaking NCAA rules PERIOD

Meanwhile UTSA was picked to finish second in Conference USA before this season and returns a backcourt that each averaged over  points per game last season PERIOD

The game was tied heading into halftime but the Sooners quickly jumped out to a double digit lead after the break and never let up PERIOD

Here are our three takeaways from the Sooners win

Slow start  fast finish

The Sooners found themselves tied heading into halftime after struggling on both sides of the court to start the game PERIOD OU was outrebounded  in the first half and made just two of  attempts from threepoint range PERIOD

In the second half the Sooners outrebounded UTSA  PERIOD

After the game Oklahoma head coach Lon Kruger said he felt the teams ability to get out in transition was the key to their success in the second half PERIOD

Defensively we did a better job of limiting them to one shot in the second half Kruger said PERIOD Transition was a huge key PERIOD Not great movement in the first half not great activity but I thought in the second half we got into transition and it freed everybody up. the Sooners outscored UTSA  in fast break points and forced  turnovers PERIOD Oklahoma held the Roadrunners to  percent shooting in the second half and  percent from the three point line PERIOD

I thought we rebounded the ball well to start the second half and that started to transition to shots and they just started falling Reaves said PERIOD

DeVion Harmon and Austin Reaves shine

Redshirt junior guard Austin Reaves appeared in his first game with the Sooners after transferring from Wichita State before last season PERIOD Reaves was instrumental in helping the Sooners get out to a big lead in the second half with his ability to score the ball PERIOD The Arkansasnative finished with  points and six rebounds while making  percent of his attempts from the field PERIOD

Austin went nuts freshman guard DeVion Harmon said PERIOD That was crazy PERIOD Just to witness that just to see him go nuts.Man as a teammate youve got to be happy for him. harmon has been the most highly anticipated recruit at Oklahoma since Trae Young committed to the Sooners in  PERIOD The fourstar combo guard from Texas had a very solid performance in his first game with the crimson and cream scoring  points on 8of13 shooting and 3of6 from behind the arc PERIOD

The Texasnative was unhappy with his performance in the exhibition match and scrimmage last week but Harmon felt Tuesdays contest was an improvement PERIOD

I didnt shoot the ball well in the exhibition game or the scrimmage so I came back tonight and was  from the 3point line and 8of13 from the fieldso Im going to take what the defense gives me. playing without Doolittle

With the teams lone senior out for the seasonopener Kruger was forced to try different lineups to prevent UTSA from dominating the glass like they did in the first half PERIOD

Kruger said that the guards were a big difference in making that change particularly sophomore guard Jamal Bieniemy PERIOD

He sat out with several fouls early Kruger said PERIOD He didnt play too much in the first half PERIOD I talked to him at halftime that he was rested now and we need something from him PERIOD I thought he did a great job on the boards really key to a lot of transition opportunities and made some good plays for assists on the offensive end. last season Bieniemy led the team in assists and he showed on Tuesday that hes capable of picking up where he left off PERIOD The Texasnative finished with two points but led the team in both rebounds and assists with  and five respectively PERIOD

Junior guard Alondes Williams had a decent game offensively in his first appearance scoring seven points on 2of7 shooting but the sixfootfive shooting guard was able to make an impact in other ways PERIOD Williams had four rebounds and three assists in  minutes of action PERIOD

Kruger has high expectations for Williams this season PERIOD
