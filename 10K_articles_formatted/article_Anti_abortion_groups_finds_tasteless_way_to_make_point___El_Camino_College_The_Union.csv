8665,2023-06-04,"after a long hour of class the first thing many students saw as they stepped out of the music departmen was neither the bright sunshine nor the squirrels chasing each other It was an oversized picture of a dead fetus PERIOD

The display was obviously to convince students that abortion was wrong PERIOD

Now these groups are legally allowed to promote whatever they wish to promote but what they do not seem to understand is that showing a severalfeettall picture of a dead dismembered fetus or baby whichever one may prefer to call it is not the most effective way to convince students that abortion is inhumane PERIOD

Not only were many students disturbed by the shocking image they were angered that the antiabortion group would actually go far enough to present such a disgusting picture PERIOD

Some were even saying that they lost their appetite while some sadly admitted that the picture ruined their good mood PERIOD

When did this group gain its right to ruin a students day

If the antiabortion advocates wanted to use such photographs by all means they should try to make alternative ways to present them PERIOD

A pamphlet or a DVD disk with a Powerpoint presentation would be better alternatives that would not offend the passby students that are not interested in the cause PERIOD  Or even a sheet of paper covering the picture with a warning like If you want to know what abortion does to a baby flip this paper would work better PERIOD

Because humans remember things better visually shocking pictures do make a good promotion for whatever the cause PERIOD

However at a place that has such diversity in ethnicity religion and beliefs as EC there should be a different approach to persuading people PERIOD

Promote the cause with more respect for the audience doing so more people would be willing to listen and be more open minded about what the group is trying to present PERIOD

Let those interested get involved and let those who arent eat their lunch PERIOD
