Clear skies PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm









As the checkered flag falls on the  Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season in just a couple weeks the career of one of NASCARs most favored drivers will come to a close PERIOD Dale Earnhardt Jr PERIOD has been the sports flagship driver for numerous years now PERIOD He hasnt been the most successful nor the most consistent but his incredibly large fanbase has unwaveringly stayed behind him through thick and thin PERIOD The Kannapolis NC native has won NASCARs yearly Most Popular Driver contest since  a 14year streak PERIOD Earnhardts popularity has been great for the sport but with his inevitable retirement nearing some people have been wondering how the sport will do once he retires in less than a month PERIOD

Will the sport experience a decrease in attendance and ratings Will Dale Jr PERIOD fans stick around and find a new driver Will they leave the sport for good Is NASCAR strong enough right now to lose such a popular figurehead

Nobody can predict the future PERIOD Nobody knows whether the sport will survive losing Dale Jr PERIOD But if these recent weeks hold any indication for the future of NASCAR there shouldnt be any worry at all PERIOD It may sound crazy but Earnhardts retirement probably couldnt come at a better time for the sport PERIOD

Throughout the past few seasons an unprecedented youth movement has swept across the sport PERIOD The list of drivers currently 25years old and younger that will compete in the  Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season is both extensive and promising PERIOD It includes Chase Elliott Kyle Larson Ryan Blaney Erik Jones Daniel Suarez William Byron Alex Bowman Darrell Wallace Jr. etc PERIOD A majority of these drivers are all already wellknown in the racing world and they are all set to compete with competitive teams for next season PERIOD But the major positive is that they each have their own unique stories and personalities that combined with success could carry them into the limelight of the racing world PERIOD

From a popularity standpoint Chase Elliott and Ryan Blaney are already two major standouts PERIOD Elliott son of former Cup Series driver Bill Elliott is a talented 21year old who many claim is the one who will replace Dale Jr PERIOD as the sports mostfavored driver PERIOD Need proof My ears are still ringing from the roar of the crowd after Sundays race at Martinsville Speedway PERIOD No not really  but the thunderous level of exuberance that came from the stands Sunday evening certainly wont go unnoticed PERIOD

Elliott was leading the race with three laps to go when he got spun into the wall by then secondplace Denny Hamlin PERIOD After the race Elliott and Hamlin had a nearconfrontational conversation PERIOD As NBCSN interviewed Elliott the crowd hollered and screamed in his favor PERIOD It seemed almost uncanny because for a second the roar of the crowd for Elliott seemed eerily similar to any reaction Dale Jr PERIOD has ever gotten PERIOD Its not the first time Elliott has received Jrlike cheers from the crowd and after Sundays race it probably wont be the last PERIOD

Then theres Blaney a reserved but wellliked 23year old from High Point NC PERIOD The high point of Blaneys MENCS career so far came earlier this season when he earned his first career victory at Pocono Raceway PERIOD It was an impressive win for the young driver since he was able to hold off a hard charging Kevin Harvick throughout the latter stage of the race PERIOD But that victory came after he almost shot himself in the foot after multiple runins with Dale Jr at the start of the year PERIOD Theres one thing you dont want to do in NASCAR and thats mess with Earnhardt because his fans wont be happy just ask Kyle Busch PERIOD Many unrepeatable words were exchanged between the two on their radios but luckily for Blaney their relationship has been gradually repaired throughout the season PERIOD Now the two are friends actively hanging out with each other and having fun PERIOD With Earnhardt on his side and talent behind the wheel Blaney definitely stands out as a bright light in NASCARs future PERIOD

But what about Larson The Elk Grove CA native really hit his stride with Chip Ganassi Racing this season PERIOD The No. chevrolet has visited Victory Lane four times already this year whilst leading over  laps PERIOD But Larsons popularity can be attested to the fact that hes one of the most diverse drivers in todays era of racing PERIOD Fans often find Larson competing in many other racing avenues most commonly on dirt in events such as the Chili Bowl and others across the country PERIOD With fans across the world not only in NASCAR Larsons future could be the one that really helps NASCAR stay relevant in the racing world as a whole PERIOD

Sounds like a lot of budding star power right Well the list keeps on going PERIOD

Hendrick Motorsports arguably the largest and most prestigious organization in NASCAR will field two rookies in the MENCS next season PERIOD Alex Bowman will take over Earnhardts No. ride and William Byron will move up into the No. car PERIOD 19year old Byron has quickly worked his way through the ranks of the sport finding success quickly in both the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series and NASCAR Xfinity Series PERIOD He gained a lot of fans and credibility in  when he went on a tear winning seven races in his first year in the Truck Series PERIOD This season Byron has been competing for one of Earnhardts teams in the Xfinity Series earning three victories already PERIOD With Byrons quick adaptability and deep talent the door is wide open to what he could accomplish in his Cup career PERIOD

Then theres Bowman who will probably have the largest amount of pressure on his shoulders next season PERIOD The 24year old will step into the seat that Dale Jr PERIOD is going to be vacating at the end of this year PERIOD But luckily for Bowman hes already felt the pressure that comes with driving Earnhardts No. car PERIOD When Earnhardt was sidelined last season due to his concussion Bowman filled the seat for numerous races PERIOD His shining moment was at Phoenix International Raceway where he lead numerous laps whilst staying in contention for the win all throughout the race PERIOD That race gave everyone a lot of confidence in Bowmans abilities and if its any indication on how hell perform in the  season  Earnhardt and his fans should be eager to cheer him on PERIOD

From a farreaching standpoint NASCAR certainly has to be excited about Suarez and Wallace PERIOD They are two graduates of NASCARs Drive for Diversity program and they both have the potential to reach audiences that NASCARs typically had a hard time finding PERIOD Suarez a Monterrey Mexico native made history last season becoming the first foreignborn driver to win a NASCAR national series championship PERIOD Hes competed fulltime this season in the Monster Energy Cup Series in the No. joe Gibbs Racing Toyota PERIOD Wallace commonly called Bubba made a major announcement last week that hed drive the famous No. richard Petty machine next season PERIOD Bubba will become the first fulltime African American driver in the toplevel of NASCAR since  PERIOD NASCAR has made great efforts to strengthen the diversity in the sport over the last decade but nothing is more helpful than seeing it take place on the track in the Cup Series PERIOD Suarez and Bubba are both great talents and will certainly have a lot of say in NASCARs future PERIOD

The youth movement hitting NASCAR will certainly help the sport battle with losing Earnhardt but that doesnt mean there arent any veteran drivers who can also take the reigns PERIOD

Martin Truex Jr PERIOD has undoubtedly been one of the biggest storylines in the entire racing world this season PERIOD Truexs story is one of both triumph and tribulation PERIOD The 37year old has experienced both spectrums of the sport but has seemed to find his stride in recent years at Furniture Row Racing PERIOD This year he has absolutely dominated the Monster Energy Cup Series winning seven races so far whilst leading over  laps PERIOD

Truexs story offtrack may be more compelling though as his longtime girlfriend Sherry Pollex has been in a strenuous battle with ovarian cancer throughout the past couple years PERIOD The two have shared their love in front of the racing world as they are normally both tearyeyed in Victory Lane together after a win PERIOD Recently Pollexs time at the track has been limited as she is going through her second round of chemotherapy treatment PERIOD But the NASCAR world has taken her battle personally and the community tends to rally around Truex and Pollex whenever she isnt doing well PERIOD Their story combined with Truexs success is easily one of the mosthumbling in all of sports right now PERIOD

Then theres someone like Jimmie Johnson who some claim hasnt gotten the recognition that he deserves for all hes done in the sport PERIOD The El Cajon CA native became only the third driver in NASCAR history last season to win seven Cup Series championships PERIOD At  years old Johnson has said he still has a few good years of racing left in him PERIOD If hes able to pull off an eighth championship it would not only solidify his place as one of NASCARs greats but as one of the greatest athletes of alltime in all of sports PERIOD Johnson has the possibility to sit alone at the top of the sports record books and NASCAR can still thrive on his storyline for a few more years to come PERIOD

Or how about Kyle Busch the driver who is loved by some but hated by others PERIOD Hes definitely one of the most talented drivers on track but some of his offtrack antics have strayed many away from being a fan PERIOD Some think hes hurting NASCAR but every sport has to have their villain figure and right now Busch is the closest thing we have to it  which isnt necessarily a bad thing PERIOD

Aside from drivers its also important to look at how NASCAR is doing as a whole PERIOD The  season has seen a lot of positives PERIOD The implementation of stage racing has completely changed the way drivers race PERIOD Daring strategy calls and bold moves which used to be saved for the end of the races are now coming into play at any point PERIOD The ontrack action can always be improved but its been pretty exciting this season PERIOD The sport has seen some very thrilling races in the last few weeks PERIOD Talladega was a wreckfest Kansas was a thriller and Martinsville was insanely entertaining.There seems to be a certain feeling of hope around the sport right now PERIOD Drivers are starting to show more emotion tracks are starting to spice things up to add intrigue NASCARs ramping up its efforts to look for ways to improve the sport and the youth fountain continues to run strong PERIOD

Now it should be noted that Earnhardt does plan on sticking around the sport PERIOD Earlier this season he announced a deal with NBC Sports to be apart of their broadcasts starting in  PERIOD His Xfinity Series team will also continue to compete next season and Earnhardt has said he plans on doing one or two Xfinity races next year PERIOD

But longstory short NASCAR certainly wont perish at the end of this season PERIOD At a time when the sport is losing its most popular driver its future may actually be brighter than ever PERIOD
