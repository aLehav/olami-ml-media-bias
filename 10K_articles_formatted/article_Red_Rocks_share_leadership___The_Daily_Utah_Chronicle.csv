Looking to their fourth and final year of eligibility Utah seniors Kristina Baskett and Nina Kim could not be more excited to get the season under way PERIOD

As the only seniors on the team Baskett and Kim might be looked at as the leaders by fans PERIOD However inside the gym the whole team is taking that responsibility PERIOD As the squad prepares for the challenging schedule that lies ahead there are no plans to anoint designated captains at this time PERIOD

We might just keep it as a team thing because its going really well Kim said PERIOD

For years the Red Rocks have been appointing a team captain until last season when they decided to stray from convention PERIOD

The best thing me and Nina can do is set the example Baskett said PERIOD Be strong in the gym and get our stuff done PERIOD We need to set a good example for people to look up to. this will be more important than ever for Utah PERIOD Because of Stephanie Neffs back injury every Red Rock will be expected to step up when her name is called PERIOD

We only have  girls on the team so we need to have everyone on board Kim said PERIOD But I think were on the right track PERIOD The bond we have as a team helps a lot. its that bond that might be Utahs biggest strength heading into the season PERIOD With a lot of work still to be done before the season kicks off the Red Rocks attribute a lot of their success to the fact that they get along so well whether theyre in the gym or not PERIOD

Were all really excited this year because we have some really good chemistry on the team Baskett said PERIOD Theres an uplifting spirit this year and were having fun in the gym which I think is an important factor because we do our best when were having fun. the gymnastics teams chemistry has made spending time in the gym more fun and more productive as well PERIOD The friendships made outside the gym have benefitted the teams performance when its time to get serious and go to work PERIOD

We know each other more personally and that way were more comfortable with each other Kim said PERIOD If were in the gym and having trouble were able to push each other its just a great atmosphere. with this being Baskett and Kims fourth goaround at preparing for the grind ahead they know exactly what it takes to get ready for the season PERIOD Freshmen dont have such an advantage but will need to learn on the fly because of the size of the current roster PERIOD

We really need the freshmen on board Baskett said PERIOD Especially since we only have  girls this year PERIOD They are here for a reason PERIOD Thats why they got a scholarship. while there is no questioning the work ethic or talent of the shorthanded squad the real question on the minds of fans and coaches is Can the team stay injuryfree throughout the year

Everyone brings something to the table but something we have to look out for is staying healthy Baskett said PERIOD With six girls in the lineup if anybody gets hurt or is sick were going to need to go to those seventh and eighth spots which means everybody needs to be ready. emailprotected
