Imagine losing a loved one and not getting any answers PERIOD How would you feel if law enforcement decided to move on to another case Project Cold Case gives cases of unsolved murders and disappearances a second chance of exposure to the public PERIOD

Project Cold Case is a Jacksonvillebased nonprofit organization that highlights cases that have fallen from law enforcement priority lists PERIOD Ryan Backman the founder of Project Cold Case developed a passion for highlighting cold cases after his fathers homicide which remains unsolved over a decade later PERIOD

In October  my dad Cliff Backman was shot and killed in a robbery here in Jacksonville and his case went cold. backman said PERIOD I decided to switch careers became a victim advocate for families that have lost loved ones to homicide. according to Backman cases may go cold for many reasons but once a case receives that status the families begin to lose hope PERIOD Some law enforcement agencies have cold case divisions however lack of manpower funding and evidence are contributing factors to keeping cases from becoming a priority PERIOD

One of the biggest things you deal with is that families start to think that no one remember their loved one and no one cares Backman stated PERIOD

Project Cold Case does not actively seek cases that have gone cold PERIOD Families of the victims reach out to Backman in an effort to highlight their loved ones cases PERIOD Family members will provide details of the victims such as their personality accomplishments and details surrounding the victims homicide or disappearance PERIOD Backman says he understands that families grieve in their own way so it may be difficult for families to talk about their loved ones PERIOD

It is helpful that I have been through something similar so we have that bond automatically Backman said PERIOD As long as someone cares then families are more than willing to open up and share their stories PERIOD They truly appreciate the help. project Cold Case has helped with the number of cold case arrests by keeping the public aware PERIOD Particularly with old cases the technological advances of DNA testing became essential PERIOD In many cases all the investigator needs is that one witness to come forward PERIOD

Recently Project Cold Case featured a robberyhomicide from  that has been solved more than  years later PERIOD

Our job is not to go out and try to solve these cases Backman stated PERIOD Our jobs are to bring awareness to the public and make sure these people are not lost or forgotten PERIOD We always keep up with the families because we want them to know we care. project Cold Case has become a bridge for families to connect to one another PERIOD What started as a mans vision to advocate for unsolved cases has become a beacon of hope for families to preserve the memory of their loved ones PERIOD Ryan Backman has turned his grief from losing his father into a symbol of light from a dark situation PERIOD As a result some families have been able to get the justice they have long fought for PERIOD
