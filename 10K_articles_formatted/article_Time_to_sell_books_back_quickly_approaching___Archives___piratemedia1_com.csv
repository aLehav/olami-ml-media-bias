Dowdy Student Stores offers students a partial refund for some of the books they want to give back at the end of the semester PERIOD

 said Katherine A PERIOD Burney textbook manager at Dowdy Student Stores PERIOD

The store is willing to buy back students books at any time during the semester but most of their business comes during exam periods PERIOD There are however times when they cannot give halfprice back PERIOD Sometimes the store gets too much of a book or a book is not going to be used in the future PERIOD In this case Dowdy has to sell them to wholesale book companies PERIOD Thereafter they cannot economically give halfprice back to students for those books PERIOD

 Burney said PERIOD

Barbara Ward assistant textbook manager at Dowdy Student Stores warns there is a need to make sure all the components of the book are intact when a student tries to resell the book PERIOD Students may not get as much money back if they fail to return a CD that was packaged with the book PERIOD

 said Ward PERIOD

Dowdy also sets up several locations across campus where students can sell their books PERIOD Ward said those locations usually include bus stops College Hill and Speight building PERIOD This year they are experimenting with the Minges bus stop in order to see if that attracts students PERIOD They have tried dining halls in the past but they were not as successful as other areas PERIOD

Burney said sometimes there is a problem with professors who wait to decide which books they want to use in future semesters PERIOD This leads the store to buying back more books than they needed if faculty decides they do not want to use a particular book any longer PERIOD

It is not always professors fault though PERIOD In some cases new editions are being printed halting them from telling Dowdy which books they are going to use PERIOD

Jenna Robinson junior art major said she did not like the system because they do not take all your books back PERIOD
