After witnessing the return of the infamous proselytizers for an entire year UNF finally has taken a stand PERIOD Sort of PERIOD

Generally outdoor areas of our campus that are accessible to the public are available to anyone for any lawful expressive activity the university said on its new website PERIOD So why cant they just kick them out Basically they cant PERIOD

On that webpage there are answers to other questions and links to the First Amendment of the Constitution along with other state legislation and university rules regarding expression on campus PERIOD

Essentially the site attempts to answer any questions students may have about free speech and expression on campus PERIOD

While the website does not mention the aforementioned individuals on the Green this seems to be the universitys first semidirect response to students complaints regarding the issue PERIOD

But back to the preachers. why cant they be removed Well since they do their demonstrations on the Green which is a protected space for any public demonstration they cannot be asked to leave PERIOD

Unless they disrupt the normal functioning of the University which in that case UNF may invoke its time place and manner discretion for outdoor spaces PERIOD

What is considered disruptive of the normal functioning of the University you might ask Well anything that includes a threat to health or safety harassment of UNF community members or other unlawful speech. on second thought they might be able to kick them out after all PERIOD

Im no free speech expert but I think there may be a case here PERIOD The preachers have been reported to have followed students back to their dorms which is a clear threat to health and safety PERIOD

Also if you have ever walked past them or been in their general area for more than five seconds then you would know that the harassment criteria are checked off pretty quickly PERIOD

UNF can invoke its time place and manner restrictions when speakers harass UNF members or threaten their health and safety which some students say these individuals have already done PERIOD

Based on what UNF has shared about its abilities to regulate speech on campus it can ask this group to leave campus PERIOD

They are in clear violation of what the school considers protected speech so whats the holdup Your move UNF PERIOD I would love to be able to chill on the Green again PERIOD
