Renowned Brazilian energy mogul Rubens Ometto Silveira Mello encouraged the U.S PERIOD to develop a green energy partnership with Brazil to increase the worlds energy sources and protect the environment in a lecture Thursday night PERIOD

Mello spoke as a part of the Faces of the AmericasRostros de las Amricas a lecture sponsored by the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies at the Harry Ransom Center PERIOD Mello spoke on the history of Brazils energy consumption and the emergence of cleaner energy based on biofuels PERIOD Mello said he hoped President Obamas trip to Brazil this past March would inspire a partnership between the two countries to help America become more energyindependent PERIOD

One country cannot have an advantage over the other Mello said PERIOD One can complete the other one there are some advances they have that we dont. mello said the introduction of cornbased ethanol in the U.S PERIOD was a very important step for the country in terms of renewable energy but that there was still more that could be done PERIOD Mello said  percent of Brazils current energy comes from renewable sources PERIOD In comparison the U.S PERIOD uses about  percent of renewable energy to meet its energy needs according to the U.S PERIOD Energy Information Administration PERIOD

Some people criticized the introduction of ethanol to U.S PERIOD markets Mello said PERIOD But the U.S PERIOD did a very good thing PERIOD It showed America and it showed the world that ethanol worked. mello is currently head of Cosan a Brazilianbased energy company that revolutionized the use of ethanol and helped make renewable energy more accessible in Brazil PERIOD Cosan recently joined with energy giant Shell to produce over  million liters of ethanol from sugar cane PERIOD

Marco Munoz assistant director of the IC2 Institute said Brazil is  years ahead of us in terms of renewable energy referencing the  Arab oil embargo PERIOD Brazil imported  percent of its oil at this time and oil prices for Brazil rose from three dollars a barrel to  PERIOD Brazil declared energy independence and turned to its sugarcanebased ethanol industry in the time of crisis and has relied heavily on the source ever since PERIOD

Cornbased ethanol is not efficient because it affects the U.S PERIOD and world food supply Munoz said PERIOD If the U.S PERIOD is dedicated to finding a cleaner source of energy sugarcanebased ethanol is the way to go. geosciences professor William Fisher spoke alongside Mello at the lecture and said the U.S PERIOD should follow Brazils lead on sustainable energy PERIOD Fisher has been traveling to Brazil since the 1970s and was in Brazil during the Arab oil embargo PERIOD

Fisher said in order to become more energy independent the U.S PERIOD needs to remove the tariffs and subsidies on Brazilian ethanol PERIOD

Brazil has a very good product and they have a lot of investments in renewable technology Fisher said PERIOD When they kill a hog they eat everything but the squeal. printed on Friday October twenty-first  as Brazils energy program could teach US
