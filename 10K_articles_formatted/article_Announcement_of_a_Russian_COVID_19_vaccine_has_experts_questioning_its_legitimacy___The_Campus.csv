On Aug PERIOD  Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology started their phase  trials of the Sputnik V COVID19 vaccine PERIOD

I know the vaccine works quite effectively helps to develop strong immunity and has gone through all the necessary tests Putin said in a cabinet meeting according to the Lancet Respiratory Medical Journal PERIOD

At . million total cases Russia sits fourth on the list detailing infection numbers worldwide according to The Moscow Times PERIOD

Alexander Gintsburg head scientist at Gamaleya that helped develop the Sputnik V vaccine said immunity from COVID19 would depend on how the individuals would respond to both the vaccine and the infection in an interview with The Moscow Times PERIOD

For some the protective level of antibodies is produced after the first vaccination and they need the second one to extend that protection Gintsburg stated in an interview with The Moscow Times PERIOD They will likely be protected two weeks after the first vaccination. the vaccine would be administered in two stages with hopes to eliminate COVID19 in its entirety but there is no guarantee that it will be a permanent fix PERIOD

If there is an infection between the first and the second shots COVID19 will occur in a weaker form Gintsburg said PERIOD

Many countries remain concerned about the authenticity of the data being recorded PERIOD The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Journalpublished a letter at the beginning of last month warning potential users of the legitimacy of the data collected amid mounting concerns PERIOD

According to the letter volunteers who received one version of the vaccine had no change in antibody counts between  and  days after the original injection PERIOD Although Russia stated it will not release the vaccine to the public until phase  trials show favorable results The Lancet claims the vaccine announcement was made with political intent rather than to help the global populace combat COVID19 PERIOD

If Sputnik Vs results are considered favorable by the Russian government they plan to strike deals with other countries  such as Brazil Mexico Saudi Arabia and India  in distribution of the vaccine according to The Wall Street Journal PERIOD

With so many countries struggling with COVID19 political scientists worry that any country  in this case Russia  could gain economic and political leverage to use on struggling nations PERIOD

The view here is that the vaccine could win Russia some hearts and minds in the nonWest and boost its geopolitical leverage said Vladimir Frolov former senior Russian diplomat and Moscowbased political analyst in an interview with The Wall Street Journal PERIOD

Concern is especially great when considering developing nations according to the WSJ PERIOD Their lack of manufacturing abilities makes the promise of a vaccine appealing but Russian partnerships create concerning notions for Western nations PERIOD

We will focus on saving people in Latin America the Middle East and Asia where most of the requests come from because these people are not thinking about politics to stifle Russia and to constrain Russia but they want to protect their citizens said Kirill Dmitriev head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund which is funding the development of the vaccine in an interview with the WSJ PERIOD

China has also begun the experimental process of creating their own vaccine by inoculating hundreds of thousands of individuals according to the WSJ PERIOD Experts expressed wide concern that the current race for a COVID19 vaccine could lead to a new strain if the initial vaccine proves less than  effective PERIOD

Because of the questionable testing procedures American experts  such as Dr PERIOD Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  have indicated that it would be unlikely for the United States to use a Chinese or Russian vaccine according to the WSJ PERIOD

I think that would instill in the public a degree of confidence said Fauci in an interview with the WSJ PERIOD Were not cutting corners and were not even going to try to get a vaccine distributed unless it was clear that there was enough evidence to indicate that its safe and effective. international
