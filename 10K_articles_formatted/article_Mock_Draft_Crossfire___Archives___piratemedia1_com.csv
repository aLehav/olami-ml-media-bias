Partly cloudy skies PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



 PERIOD Washington Redskins Julio Jones

Wide receiver Alabama

Jones was always known to be a firstround talent but his impressive performance at the NFL combine really vaulted him up into top10 consideration PERIOD He is perfect for the Redskins whose recent selections at the receiver position have not panned out PERIOD In Jones Washington gets a 1000yard receiving collegiate player who is deceivingly fast and could cause matchup problems for opposing defenses PERIOD

 PERIOD Dallas Cowboys J.J PERIOD Watt

Defensive end Wisconsin

With the drafts best defensive line prospects being gobbled up quickly Dallas has to grab one before its too late PERIOD Watt who is one of the larger defensive end prospects could provide Dallas with a player to put opposite DeMarcus Ware PERIOD

 PERIOD Tennessee Titans Robert Quinn

Defensive end North Carolina

Its amazing what a year can do for a prospect as Quinn was a surefire topfive pick before NCAA rule violations caused him to miss his entire senior year as a Tar Heel PERIOD As a junior Quinn had  sacks and was on pace to have a recordsetting senior year PERIOD He has all the tools necessary to be a force on the edge for Tennessee whose aging defensive line needs a spark PERIOD

 PERIOD San Francisco 49ers Patrick Peterson

Cornerback LSU

The  pick in this years draft class falls right into the lap of the 49ers PERIOD San Francisco lucks out as no team above them has an urgent need at cornerback and this LSU product should be able to upgrade the 49ers aging pass defense as well as help out in the return game PERIOD

 PERIOD Cleveland Browns A.J PERIOD Green

Wide receiver Georgia

The Browns simply need a playmaker on the offensive side of the ball and Green fits the mold as the best wide receiver prospect in this years draft PERIOD Cleveland quarterback Colt McCoy should be very happy with this selection because A.J PERIOD Green has the makings to be an allout monster in terms of offensive production PERIOD

 PERIOD Arizona Cardinals Von Miller

Linebacker Texas AM

The Cardinals two biggest needs this offseason are quarterback and linebacker and with the two top quarterbacks already taken Arizona isnt in the right spot to reach for another signalcaller in the top five picks PERIOD Instead they fall back on Miller who just happens to be the NCAAs leader in sacks last season PERIOD The Cardinals have had a string of quality linebackers Miller provides the youth and aggressiveness Arizona needs to get some pressure off the edge PERIOD

 PERIOD Cincinnati Bengals Blaine Gabbert

Quarterback Missouri

The Bengals starting quarterback Carson Palmer has made it perfectly clear that he has no desire to stay in Cincinnati and with the current NFL lockout I think the Bengals will look to the draft to replace their starter before he is even allowed to leave PERIOD They will land Gabbert who is thought to be the most proready quarterback of this class PERIOD

 PERIOD Buffalo Bills Nick Fairley

Defensive tackle Auburn

While Blaine Gabbert is a trendy pick here The Bills simply need a presence on the defensive line a little bit more PERIOD Buffalo finished last in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game . despite being third best in the league in passing yards allowed per game . pERIOD

 PERIOD Denver Broncos Marcell Dareus

Defensive tackle Alabama

This has been almost a consensus pick among all expert mock drafts out there simply because it makes very good sense PERIOD Dareus has distanced himself from Auburns Nick Fairley as the best defensive line prospect of this years class and could immediately help a Denver defense that finished thirty-first in the league in rushing yards allowed per game . pERIOD

 PERIOD Carolina Panthers Cam Newton

Quarterback Auburn

Carolina had major problems on the offensive side of the ball last season finishing dead last in the entire NFL in total points . yards . and passing yards . pERIOD Panther fans have made it well known that they dont think Jimmy Clausen can get the job done and if Carolina does go after a quarterback I think Newton is their best fit PERIOD
