Better late.. PERIOD Tackling procrastination starts  tomorrow

Whats the greatest nation on Earth ProcrastiNATION.Well maybe not the greatest but probably the mostpopulous.I am among the minions of that everexpanding nationand I have been as long as I can remember.Ever since I was a child Ive been perpetually late.Late for school late for supper late for just abouteverything PERIOD And I dont really know why.Somewhere early in life I must have mixed up a coupleold adagesTardiness is next to godliness isnt that how itgoes and Never put off till tomorrow what you can put offuntil the day after tomorrow.In spite of my longstanding belief in thesemisinterpreted adages I eventually came to understand thatprocrastination is generally not a good thing.Lifes overlooked and postponed duties like neglecteddogs have the annoying tendency to pounce unexpectedly andbite one squarely in the unwittingly exposed buttocks.Grades suffer PERIOD So do relationships PERIOD Loans PERIOD Utilities.Credit ratings.But still the great nation of Procrasti continues togain citizens  and to retain even its most elder statesmenand women.Telling someone to stop procrastinating is like tellingsomeone to stop smoking PERIOD We know its bad for us but we doit anyway PERIOD The only way well quit is when we really REALLYwant to.I keep telling myself I want to quit putting thingsoff but my heart just isnt in it.I still exhibit a myriad of procrastinatorialtendencies.It takes me half an hour to make Minute Rice forexample.I cannot recall ever having seen the first five minutesof a movie even when I rent a tape go figure.I often stay up until  a.m PERIOD watching infomercials forno other reason than to postpone going to sleep PERIOD In themorning I pummel the snooze button to postpone waking up.I watch the piles of laundry spread out across myapartment taking up most of the very little usable space Icall my home PERIOD Usually I consider that a good thing becausethe dirty clothes cover the floor which I didnt quite getaround to vacuuming this uh year.Then one day the underwear drawer is empty and I rushfrantically to do one load of laundry so my mother will notbe embarrassed if I get in an accident PERIOD That or I go outand buy some new skivvies instead the laundry can waituntil another day after all.And deep down I feel guilty.I think of all the classes Ive missed of all thepopcorn I never had time to buy at the movies or of all thecolumns I had to write at  oclock in the morning donttell me you havent noticed.But still the procrastination continues.Im convinced its genetic.My parents are generally fairly punctual so I guess Icant pin it on them but thanks to the wonderful discoveryof recessive genes I can feel free to pass the blame off onjust about any of my ancestors PERIOD Perhaps mygreatgreatgreatgreatgreat grandfather at whose name Icould only guess.Somewhere among all the players who had a hand in thestructure of my good old double helix lies the answer.Generations ago perhaps back in the Old Country a relativeof mine was a laggard a guy who was never on time foranything  and liked it.That has to be the case.All I know is its not my fault.Even so Im going to break the vicious cycle oflateness and procrastination PERIOD I will overcome naturespredetermination of my punctuality PERIOD I will rise up and sayYes by golly Im going to change my wicked ways PERIOD Imgoing to put an end to my awful addiction to the devilstool we call procrastination.Ill start tomorrow PERIOD
