 National Football League NFL players have been arrested since the Super Bowl in early February PERIOD None however have the name recognition of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez who was taken into police custody and charged with firstdegree murder in addition to five gunrelated charges on June  PERIOD On August  Hernandez was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of  yearold Odin Lloyd setting up what promises to be one of the most intriguing legal hearings in recent history PERIOD

Though former Buffalo Bills running back O.J PERIOD Simpson was certainly a more accomplished player when he was charged with murder in  Hernandezs starstatus ought not to be underestimated PERIOD His rookie year in  as a   lbs  yearold he caught  passes for  yards and six touchdowns  the best stat line of any rookie tight end that year other than fellow Patriot tight end Rob Gronkowski PERIOD In  Gronkowski and Hernandez teamed up for the single greatest statistical season of any tight end combination in the history of the National Football League with Hernandez finishing with  catches  yards and seven touchdowns PERIOD He was named to the Pro Bowl at seasons end and although he was eventually awarded a fiveyear  million contract his  season was injuryplagued and disappointing PERIOD

Now Hernandez is facing far more serious problems than a nagging shoulder injury PERIOD Since Odin Lloyd was found fatally shot in North Attleborough Massachusetts on June  ties between Hernandez and the murder had surfaced with greater and greater abundance until he was finally taken into custody a week later PERIOD From video surveillance footage showing Hernandez pacing his home with a Glock . pistol in hand to texts from the victim to his sister to accounts from friends the evidence is piling up in this highprofile case PERIOD While most are quick to assume that the indictment and the evidence against him means that Aaron Hernandez will sit in a prison cell for the rest of his life that may not be the case PERIOD

For Hernandez skirting the law is nothing foreign PERIOD Since  he has been linked to six shootings but until June he had escaped any consequence PERIOD Further in January of  Hernandez and a friend were pulled over for going  m.p.h PERIOD The friend driving was under the influence but Hernandez supposedly stuck his head out the window and quipped Trooper Im Aaron Hernandez  its OK. in March of  police were called to Hernandezs beach rental house for a domestic dispute with his girlfriend but no arrest was made PERIOD While playing under legendary coach Urban Meyer at the University of Florida Hernandez had more significant problems PERIOD In April of  he assaulted a waiter at a Gainesville restaurant rupturing the waiters eardrum with a punch PERIOD The matter was settled out of court supposedly with Gator coaches PERIOD In the spring of  months before the NFL draft Hernandez was out at Gainesville bars when someone tried to steal a chain off one of his teammates PERIOD A shooting followed and one of the victims described the assailant as possibly Hispanic or Hawaiian with multiple tattoos on his arms  a description matching Hernandez PERIOD Nothing became of it all and the case is still open PERIOD

On April    teams passed on the opportunity to draft Hernandez due to his shady history PERIOD He had been a firstteam AllAmerican and was the winner of the  John Mackey Award as college footballs top tight end but rumors of his recreational drug use and the rough crowd he was associated with drove teams away PERIOD Patriots head coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft chose to ignore the warning signs and grabbed the big tight end with freakish athletic ability about  spots after what was projected for him PERIOD The rest is history and now we all wait to see if the escape artist that is Aaron Hernandez can slither out of another tight spot PERIOD Frankly it would not be shocking if he did PERIOD There has been no murder weapon found and no witness to the murder or its preparation PERIOD There is however significant circumstantial evidence PERIOD For a man with such a long history of eluding consequences that circumstantial evidence may not be enough PERIOD All we can do now is sit and wait for the trial PERIOD
