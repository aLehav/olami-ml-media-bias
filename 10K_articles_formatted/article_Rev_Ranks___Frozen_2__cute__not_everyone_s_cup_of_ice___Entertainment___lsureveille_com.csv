I think we can agree it will be virtually impossible to create a sequel that parallels the magical winter wonderland phenomenon which was Disneys Frozen but the second installment to the franchise didnt completely suck PERIOD

The movie begins with a flashback of Elsa Idina Menzel and Annas Kristen Bell childhood PERIOD Their father King Agnarr Alfred Molina tells them the story of their grandfather Runeard Jeremy Sisto building a dam in the Enchanted Forest of the Northuldra as a sign of peace PERIOD During a celebration of the peace treaty in the forest a fight emerged and Runeard was killed PERIOD

The fight enraged the elemental spirits of air earth fire and water who all disappeared as a wall of mist entrapped everyone in the forest PERIOD Agnarr survived due to the help of an unknown person PERIOD That same night Queen Iduna Evan Rachel Wood tells them of Ahtohallan the mythical river believed to hold all truth of the past PERIOD

In the present Arendelle celebrates fall with Elsa as regent for three years PERIOD Elsa begins hearing a mysterious voice calling out to her PERIOD After breaking into song Into the Unknown Elsa awakens the elemental spirits who force everyone out of Arendelle PERIOD Grand Pabbie Ciarn Hinds reveals Elsa must set things right by discovering the truth about the past or all will be lost PERIOD

The storyline was interesting enough because of the mysteries that were set to be resolved PERIOD The film gave answers to the truth of the past as well as the origin of Elsas power PERIOD However Elsas quest came out of left field PERIOD It was revealed that she was unhappy living in Arendelle and longed for more but it didnt feel like that until half way through the film PERIOD

Anna Kristoff Jonathan Groff and Olaf Josh Gad are pure of soul thus they provide much of the comic relief in the film PERIOD I didnt find Kristoffs struggle to propose to Anna funny but it was necessary so shed leave him behind in the forest PERIOD I didnt think Olaf could make me cry again after some people are worth melting for but that I love you to Anna hit differently PERIOD

The music was very Disneyesque PERIOD Menzel Bell Groff and Gad have some serious pipes in them making that aspect of any film starring them very hard to botch PERIOD However none of the songs were nearly as much of a bop as Let It Go. the only song that came relatively close was Into the Unknown. shortly after the film was released news outlets reported that Disney signed a contract with the Smi people of Scandinavia to not misrepresent indigenous people PERIOD The Northuldra are based on them PERIOD People praised Disney for the efforts and setting this precedent PERIOD Disneys efforts are noteworthy because cultural misrepresentation can carry negative repercussions PERIOD

Its a cute film PERIOD Its progressive but still very Disney PERIOD Ultimately its a family film geared toward children PERIOD It has good animation and its uplifting PERIOD Elsa in her white dress riding Nokk the water spirit guarding the sea to Ahtohallan in horse form is a cosplayers dream PERIOD But if youre a Tarantino or Kubrick fan maybe skip this one PERIOD
