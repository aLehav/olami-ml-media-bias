It was a family affair on Sunday as UNF womens basketball took on the North Alabama Lions for the weekend seriess back end PERIOD Osprey veteran Jazz Bond took on sister Jaida Bond of UNA in a duel that went down to the wire PERIOD

Not to spoil the ending of this story but Jazz Bond was certainly the differencemaker PERIOD

Things did not look great for UNF early on as the UNA Lions seized control PERIOD Despite a sloppy start for the Ospreys Jazz Bond reached a milestone PERIOD A firstquarter bucket by the redshirtsenior allowed her to surpass  career points PERIOD This achievement would be overshadowed quickly due to the rest of her impressive performance though PERIOD

The story of the first half was the threepoint shooting for UNA and a lack thereof for the Ospreys PERIOD This discrepancy allowed the Lions to take an  point lead into the half as UNF trailed  PERIOD

UNA wouldnt take their foot off the pedal as the third quarter began primarily due to the critical play of guard Jaida Bond PERIOD The sophomore would collect a total of  points on the afternoon tying her careerhigh PERIOD However this incredible performance would be outdone by an opponent one she has quite the bond with PERIOD

The Ospreys would get things together and chipped away at the sizable UNA lead throughout most of the third quarter PERIOD There was a tangible momentum shift taking place something that favored UNF PERIOD Going into the fourth quarter it was time to tune into the Marissa Mackins show PERIOD The guard took over leading the charge that would ultimately see the Ospreys take the lead at  PERIOD

Two consecutive threes from UNA guard Alexis Callins put the Lions up by six but the Ospreys had an answer PERIOD A  UNF run was capped off by a Jazz Bond threepointer but she had more of where that came from PERIOD

Callins would come up clutch yet again hitting a three to tie the game with  seconds remaining PERIOD UNF then had a chance to end the game and one Osprey made sure overtime wouldnt happen Bond Jazz Bond PERIOD Things looked bleak as UNA swarmed Marissa Mackins but this left Jazz Bond open PERIOD Bond was able to get off a wild threepointer over the defender PERIOD The UNF bench erupted as the shot went through giving the Ospreys a thrilling  victory PERIOD
