Bring on the Tide

Enough already PERIOD Just when you thought the sideshow was getting more interesting than the main attraction the football team plays a game that should have come with a NoDoz warning label Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while viewing PERIOD

So lets hear it for the sideshow PERIOD

In the past two weeks the Lions spawned a minor controversy with their shall we say untaxing schedule PERIOD In a telephone press conference with Head Coach Joe Paterno one sportswriter complained that it consisted of  Frank Purdue was not amused with the comparison PERIOD

The Lions helped provoke a vicious marshmallow blitzkrieg in the freshman section of the grandstands by urging students not to participate in just that PERIOD Better they should have urged them not to take a flying leap from the top edge of Beaver Stadium if the team really wanted to put an end to it PERIOD

Penn State has been visited by the Yankee Clipper Joe DiMaggio who made a special guest appearance before the East Carolina game PERIOD And by the Centre County Clipper Bill Clinger who took his congressional reelection campaign to the skies above Beaver Stadium with airplanebanner advertisements PERIOD

In between the Lions have played some football but youd hardly notice since most witnesses have bolted back to their tailgates by the end of the first half anymore by which time the Lions have usually taken a commanding lead PERIOD

For four weeks the Lions have played second fiddle to what are usually the games diversions as fans have entertained themselves with slow motion waves and fast forward exits PERIOD

That being the case it is probably a relief that Alabama is next on the schedule PERIOD
