2241,2022-03-16,"img id80175 alignalignleft The Student Care Center SCC a U of C Hospitals UCH clinic for University students is undergoing a series of changes following the departure of two top administrators last year PERIOD

Proposals include expanding the number of drugs available for free and without prescription packaging pills in bottlesmedicines like ibuprofen are currently given in paper envelopesand overhauling the clinic to improve its efficiency and aesthetic features PERIOD

We just want to strive to do things in a way thats more effective said Kristine Bordenave the new director of the SCC PERIOD We want to look at how we can make medicines more accessible and safer bring costs down and make this a place that is a little more welcoming. the center is working with the UCH pharmacy to buy drugs and lab tests in higher volume in the hope of driving down prices and increasing the quantities available to students PERIOD For instance the SCC is looking to enable women to purchase a threemonth supply of birth control rather than the 28day supply currently available PERIOD

Increased purchases have put certain medications in short supply PERIOD Similar issues have dogged a transition to an updated computer scheduling system PERIOD Training and implementation have increased clinic waiting times PERIOD

As changes were occurring we had staff off training and that probably did affect service some Bordenave said PERIOD But the implementation went well and I think in the long run it will help a lot. the SCC is also consulting an interior designer to help improve both the style and comfort of the center for students as well as the efficiency and utility for staff PERIOD Additionally the center is planning a number of events across campus to promote student health issues PERIOD

Weve actually teamed up with the bookstore Merck and Sony to have an event at the bookstore where Sony brings in an upandcoming artist and gets students information about the HPV vaccine and were bargaining now with insurers for next year to try to be able to provide that at a lower cost for students said Tara Paulson the new director of health promotion PERIOD

The center has also been seeking a new location on campus scouting other sites in the medical complex PERIOD

We desperately need to find a new space for the SCC with more room Bordenave said PERIOD The center is way less efficient than it could be. your donation will support the student journalists of University of Chicago PERIOD Your contributions go towards our annual website hosting costs and equipment costs PERIOD
