Sophomore guard Shavon Shields went  for  from the field and  for  from the freethrow line to score nearly half of Nebraskas  points in its victory against Illinois on Wednesday night PERIOD Shields had not scored more than  points since Dec PERIOD  against Creighton PERIOD

Welcome to the NCAA Tournament bubble Nebraska mens basketball PERIOD

Say hello to St PERIOD Johns PERIOD Tell West Virginia coach Bob Huggins hed better beat Baylor on Saturday PERIOD Ask Marcus Smart and Oklahoma State if they are feeling the pressure yet PERIOD

Sundays upset victory at Michigan State helped the Huskers join those three teams and many more on the proverbial tourney bubble a place that causes more stress for coaches players and fans than a longtailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs PERIOD

Lets get serious though PERIOD Nebraska has a legitimate shot to make the tournament PERIOD

Im not even reaching when I say it and Im pretty skeptical when it comes to this teams postseason resume PERIOD Not because I dont think the program is heading in the right direction but because the Huskers had some bad losses early PERIOD Remember UAB and Creighton

Even after Nebraska knocked off Illinois for its fourth win in five games last Wednesday I kept shaking my head every time someone brought up the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

Too many losses I said PERIOD Not a strong enough resume yet PERIOD They have to beat a couple more ranked opponents PERIOD

Im still skeptical PERIOD Mainly because Nebraskas bubble is thin PERIOD Make one mistake and it will burst PERIOD

Let me break it down PERIOD

The Huskers have six games remaining and are currently sixth in the Big Ten standings with a  record PERIOD Put that with a  overall record along with a 22ndranked strength of schedule and a No PERIOD  RPI ranking and the Huskers resume isnt that great PERIOD

Heres the catch though PERIOD

Nebraska plays four home games Penn State Purdue Northwestern Wisconsin and two on the road Illinois Indiana to finish the season PERIOD All of those games are winnable especially the ones at home where the Huskers have only lost once this season PERIOD

And all those teams except Wisconsin have a sub. conference record PERIOD

For Nebraska to make the tournament it needs to win at least five of its last six games along with a win in the Big Ten Tournament to make the big dance PERIOD Im allowing the Huskers one hiccup on the road but they need to win all four home games PERIOD

That puts them at a minimum of  wins and a  conference record to go along with the strong strength of schedule and RPI rankings PERIOD Tim Miles and company wouldnt have to sweat too much on Selection Sunday with a resume like that PERIOD

Of course getting to that point wont be easy PERIOD

The biggest test for Nebraska will be Thursday night against Penn State a team that beat the Huskers earlier this season PERIOD

In the past whenever Nebraska got any sort of national attention it faltered in the next game PERIOD Thats why it took two and a half seasons to win backtoback conference games PERIOD

Also the last time this program knocked off a top10 opponent and was in the discussion for the NCAA Tournament   under Doc Sadler  it lost to a mediocre opponent at home PERIOD

Remember that

The Huskers upset No PERIOD  Texas then lost to Kansas State at home four days later PERIOD

Nebraska cant afford that kind of slip Thursday PERIOD The team knows that too PERIOD

The players are focused PERIOD They know whats at stake but they are accepting the challenge PERIOD

The NCAA Tournament is always in our mind Terran Petteway said Monday PERIOD We know we cant afford to lose because we lost some bad games at the start of the season PERIOD But thats making us come out with a chip on our shoulder knowing we have something to prove. well put Petteway PERIOD So lets see what youve got PERIOD
