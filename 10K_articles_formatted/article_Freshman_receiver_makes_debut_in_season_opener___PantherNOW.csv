Its been said that dreaming about your goals is just half the battle and putting in the work to actually achieve your goals is the other half in order for them to come true PERIOD Stanley Thomas lived up to his expectations in his debut PERIOD

Playing in my first game was great Thomas said PERIOD It was very fast and there was a lot of things that were unexpected but I got through it and it was great. the freshman receiver who moved into the starting lineup during the offseason did not disappoint as he led Panthers in receiving yards for the season opener PERIOD

The 6foot2 185pound wide receiver recorded  of the Panthers  receiving yards connecting with quarterback Alex McGough as if season opener was not his first collegiate game PERIOD His play of the night was a 45yard connection that landed the Panthers in a great situation on the Indiana 14yard line PERIOD

As I looked up I saw that it was only one safety Thomas said PERIOD McGough saw it and I beat him and it just led me the way PERIOD It felt great. thomas showed Panther fans the beginnings of being a dream weaver despite the  loss to Indiana PERIOD

Stanley is an exceptional route runner wide receivers coach Kort Shankweiler told Pete Pelegrin PERIOD He does a lot of stuff naturally that you dont have to spend time coaching. there was a lot of miscommunication on plays and a few dropped balls that couldve put the Panthers in a position to win their home opener PERIOD Although Thomas had a phenomenal start to the season he knows that he and the team have to go back to the drawing board and prepare for Maryland to grab their first win PERIOD

We have another big game against Maryland Thomas said PERIOD Now our focus is on that PERIOD Come in tomorrow get ready and get all of that right. the Panthers will play the University of Maryland on Friday Sept PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD
