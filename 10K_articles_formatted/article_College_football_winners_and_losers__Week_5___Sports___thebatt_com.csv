Freshman OL Mark Nabou  celebrates with graduate RB Earnest Crownover  during the Southwest Classic against Arkansas at ATT Stadium on Saturday Sept PERIOD   PERIOD Chris SwannThe Battalion

There were plenty of upsets blowouts and close games through the first five weeks of the season PERIOD Some teams are still in the hunt for a national title some are surprising the college football world and some are a sinking ship PERIOD

Here are the winners and losers from Week  PERIOD

Winner Maryland and Taulia Tagovailoa

The Maryland Terrapins started the season  and Tagovailoa has been a big part of the success PERIOD The senior quarterback has completed  of his passes for  yards while throwing for  touchdowns and rushing for three PERIOD

The Terrapins havent really played anyone yet though PERIOD Their wins were against Towson Charlotte Virginia Michigan State and Indiana PERIOD Maryland is still undefeated which is all that matters PERIOD However the Terrapins face their biggest challenge of the season in Week  when they travel to Columbus Ohio to take on No PERIOD  Ohio State PERIOD

The group still has home matchups with No PERIOD  Penn State and No PERIOD  Michigan down the road but if Maryland can escape Columbus with a win the Terrapins could roll into the Penn State game  PERIOD

Loser Dana Holgorsen

The Houston head coachs seat just keeps getting hotter and hotter PERIOD

Coming into the season Houston fans knew the season wouldnt be easy PERIOD It is the Cougars first season in the Big  and they lost key playmakers from last years team PERIOD Quarterback Clayton Tune departed for the NFL after starting for Houston for the past few years and the Cougars also lost star receiver Tank Dell to the league PERIOD

That still isnt an excuse for the product Holgorsen has put on the field so far PERIOD Houston started the season with a win against UTSA but fell in overtime to Rice in Week  PERIOD Houston then was blown out by TCU but followed with a win over Sam Houston State PERIOD

This past week the Cougars lost  to Texas Tech PERIOD The game was close at the end of the first half but Holgorsens team was outscored  in the second half PERIOD

Houston is  on the year and still has matchups against West Virginia No PERIOD  Texas Kansas State and Cincinnati PERIOD If the Cougars cant win or stay competitive in these games Holgorsen may be out of a job before the end of the season PERIOD

Winner The United States Air Force

This years Air Force Falcons look to do more this season than just beat Army and Navy PERIOD

This group of cadets must have a guardian angel because the team has not lost a game in almost a year with its last loss coming to the Boise State Broncos on Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

The chair force has been anything but careless so far this season as it has walloped a majority of its opponents this year and remains one of  undefeated teams in the country PERIOD

The milehigh airmen average . points on offense while only giving up an average of . to their opponents PERIOD Senior fullback Emmanuel Michel is the general of this offense with the triple crown of  carries  and eight rushing touchdowns PERIOD

These boys are out for blood in the Mountain West Conference and they have the potential to go farther than just the Armed Forces Bowl PERIOD

P.S PERIOD Rutgers covered the Spread against Wagner Im telling you it is easy money PERIOD

Loser Brian Kelly

Coach Brian Kellys Tigers lost a shootout in Oxford Mississippi this Saturday and had their playoff dreams torn to smithereens PERIOD After the seasonopening loss to Florida State their margin for error was already diminished but now they will need a miracle to simply make it out of the SEC without any more losses PERIOD

The Tigers defense has not been up to par so far this season giving up over  points to three of its five opponents PERIOD In fact the Bayou Bengals have allowed multiple touchdowns to every team they have played not named Grambling State PERIOD

Senior quarterback Jayden Daniels looks to be one of the best players under center in all of college football but the Tigers have been whipped twice and their defense needs a serious turnaround if the Tigers want to make any noise under Kelly PERIOD

With their title hopes down the drain these Cajuns will look to play spoiler to the remainder of the SEC bringing everyone down with them PERIOD

Winner Jaxson Dart

It was junior quarterback Jaxson Dart who came out as a winner in Ole Miss backandforth victory over LSU PERIOD

In a crucial Top  battle in the SEC West Dart led his team in keeping its hopes alive for a division championship PERIOD He did so by torching the LSU defense for  yards and four touchdowns through the air PERIOD

Knowing that the Rebels still have some tough games ahead in Georgia and Texas AM it was important for Dart and Ole Miss to come out on top PERIOD After an average performance in the loss against Alabama Dart bounced back and continues to have an argument as one of the top  quarterbacks in the conference PERIOD

Dart also was able to give people on social media a great laugh with his quality rapping skills PERIOD While livestreaming on Instagram the team celebrated the win by listening to Sexyy Reds hit single SkeeYee. sKEE YEE

Loser USCs Defense

The USC defense has been suspect since Week  PERIOD This past Saturday the Trojans defensive coordinator Alex Grinch and his defense gave up  points on  yards of total offense PERIOD

Colorados offense has looked good at times this season but a struggling offensive line and missing sophomore wide receiver Travis Hunter caused them to only score six points last week to Oregon PERIOD

Allowing that amount of yards and points to an average offense is not where the Trojans need to be at to contend for a National Championship PERIOD Their Heismanwinning quarterback junior Caleb Williams can only do so much PERIOD

When the offense struggles as it did in the second half against the Buffaloes the defense is going to have to step up for USC to be able to win big games PERIOD

If it doesnt get fixed coach Lincoln Riley may need to move on from Grinch at defensive coordinator despite them working together since Rileys time at Oklahoma PERIOD
