Thanks in part to head coach Tina Samara and her coaching staff the West Virginia womens tennis team will have a different mentality from the one it had in the spring when it travels to Ohio State Saturday than they did in the spring season PERIOD

 Samara said PERIOD 

Ohio State enters the match ranked No PERIOD  and just coming off a defeat to No PERIOD  South Florida PERIOD Samara believes it may only take one win for the Mountaineers before the momentum starts rolling PERIOD

 she said PERIOD 

In Samaras second season as head coach she is instilling a newer and more confident mentality in the program and that confidence starts during preparation PERIOD

 Samara said PERIOD 

Samara has been instilling that mentality in both old and new Mountaineers PERIOD

The oldest and most experienced Mountaineers are senior Veronica Cardenas and junior Emily Mathis PERIOD

The duo produced  combined wins for West Virginia in the fall season but it is the experience the two have gained over the years that really excites Samara even if it may not be at the level Samara has them now competing PERIOD

 Samara said PERIOD 

Another member who gained valuable experience in the fall is sophomore Mary Chupa who will join Mathis on the doubles court PERIOD The only other upperclassman on the roster is senior Catie Wickline a former walkon PERIOD

The Mountaineers also feature an international player on the squad PERIOD Ikttesh Chahal is a freshman from Chandigarh India who competed in the fall PERIOD

 she said PERIOD 

The final Mountaineer who will get a taste of her first action against the Buckeyes is freshman Madison Hromada PERIOD Samara wants to see Hromada ease into college tennis and take what she can get PERIOD
