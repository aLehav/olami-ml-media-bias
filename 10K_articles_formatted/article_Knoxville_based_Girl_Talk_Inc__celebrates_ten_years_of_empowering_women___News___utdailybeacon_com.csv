Ten years ago UT alumnus Denetria Moore decided that young girls needed more voices in their corner PERIOD

Now her idea has become a reality through Girl Talk Inc. an organization with a mission to help girls from the ages of  through  increase their confidence and selfesteem PERIOD

To celebrate their 10year anniversary Girl Talk Inc PERIOD launched the Power of One campaign on Nov PERIOD   PERIOD The goal of the campaign is to highlight  women in  days giving recognition to empowered women on Girl Talk Inc.s website and Facebook page PERIOD

We are encouraging people to submit nominations of women who they know really embody the principles of Girl Talk Janea Peterson UT alumnus and administrative and program assistant at Girl Talk Inc. said PERIOD Its recognizing women in the community that embody the mission and the values of Girl Talk. the values the organization promotes include college and career readiness and selfesteem and mentoring plays a major role in spreading that message PERIOD

There are a lot of children who dont have a positive person to pour into them PERIOD Girl Talk brings together women to pour back into young girls Star Starks a Girl Talk Inc PERIOD mentor said PERIOD To let them know that they dont have to make the same mistakes that weve made  or may not have made  in order to become better women. starks is both a communitybased and schoolbased mentor who began mentoring in August  PERIOD She hoped to teach young girls that it is okay to be who they are and to love themselves for that same reason PERIOD

Theres still bullying and theres still the issue of selfesteem that girls continue to face PERIOD But theres also cyberbullying now and more exposure to cellphones and TV so it creates this image in their minds of what they need to be in order to be a woman Starks said PERIOD I try to text the girls in the morning before they go to school just to say I hope you have a wonderful day PERIOD Dont let anything get you down. there are approximately  girls in the organizations communitybased and schoolbased programs and girls and mentors meet once a month to do various activities such as going to dinner and a movie PERIOD

In the schoolbased program currently active in  Knox County schools mentors meet with girls after school for one hour per week for  weeks a semester PERIOD There is a waiting list for the communitybased program based on the number of mentors available PERIOD Currently the ratio of girls to a mentor is four to one however Girl Talk Inc PERIOD hopes to bring that ratio down to one girl per mentor PERIOD

Mentors should be at least  years old care about the girls want to see them succeed and actually have the time PERIOD Volunteers are asked to commit at least one year to mentoring PERIOD

Its not an extensive process but it is volunteering so of course thats a lot of time Peterson said PERIOD
