Ankita Bhanot Dining EditorApr  

Passover the Jewish festival commemorating the liberation of the Israelites began last Friday April  and will conclude this Saturday April  PERIOD The weeklong celebration consists of prayer time spent with family and friends and lots of traditional food PERIOD This year Seamless the popular fooddelivery service has released a Passoverinspired menu for people who might not be able to cook PERIOD

Menu options are cooked fresh to order and are available from four restaurants Coppelia Miriam Mile End Manhattan and Mile End Brooklyn PERIOD Some popular menu items include matzo ball soup latkes chopped liver and barbeque chicken PERIOD Some of the more unique options from Coppelia include Guacamole con Pescado Ahumado which consists of chunky avocado achiote smoked whitefish salad Yucatan style horseradish habanero red onion and matzoh PERIOD Also offered is Tacos de Brisket a combination of Chipotle braised brisket matzoh tortillas avocado red onion and chipotle salsa PERIOD These meals are labeled as not necessarily kosher but Passoverfriendly. lindsey Ruthen the Media Relations Associate at Seamless says the company decided to launch a menu for Passover because of the large audience it would serve in the city PERIOD

Weve always said that Seamless is How New York Eats Ruthen said PERIOD Passover is a wellknown holiday among New Yorkers whether they are celebrating the holiday or just want to try something new and we wanted to make it even easier for our diners to celebrate this huge cultural milestone. seamless was most inspired to launch this menu because of their motto to work hard to surprise and delight diners at all the moments that matter to them. all of these menu concepts are created and prepared inhouse by each of the participating restaurants PERIOD

Steinhardt freshman Carly Gainsburg who celebrates Passover every year is hesitant to use the service because she believes a key tradition is actually being in the kitchen with family PERIOD

I think its a good idea but I personally would not use it Gainsburg said PERIOD Theres something special about spending the day cooking with your family and that is an experience I wouldnt want to sacrifice. although this is the first year of Passoverinspired menus Seamless hopes to continue this option every year PERIOD

Ruthen believes the menus will be successful because of their variety combining traditional Jewish foods with some more modern meals PERIOD

We aim to provide our diners with local favorites that they can enjoy from the comfort of home Ruthein said PERIOD In both cases we see the biggest benefit of offering Passover meals as bringing convenience and delight to diners who are celebrating Passover. email Ankita Bhanot at emailprotected PERIOD
