Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Smartwatches have been around for a couple of years now but no one seemed to care until Apple threw their name into the mix PERIOD

The notion of having an extension of your phone in your watch has existed for more than  years now PERIOD It goes back to  when Samsung released a smartphone and watch hybrid PERIOD They released another model in  PERIOD Since that year several models have entered the market but the market itself remained stagnant as the Associated Press reported in September PERIOD

But that didnt stop a myriad of users previously indifferent to wearable tech from jumping onto the bandwagon when Apple announced it was joining with the Apple Watch PERIOD Im not sure which makes me shake my head more  consumers flocking to the product because its the new Apple gadget or the fact that our consumerist culture is no longer content with a watch that only tells time PERIOD Either way there are a number of reasons why you should take a pass on the new gadgets PERIOD

Theyre Expensive

The Apple Watch is set to debut at  which doesnt sound expensive for a new computer product PERIOD It is however when you consider that the smartwatch will not be a standalone gadget PERIOD Youre paying  to have what is essentially another phone on your wrist with a much smaller screen PERIOD It can read your heartbeat but this has little practical use for everyday life PERIOD

They Lack New Features

I had similar thoughts of cynicism when Apple unveiled its first iPhone in  and I turned out to be wrong eventually buying one myself PERIOD Smartphones are incredibly useful PERIOD But smartwatches only have a fraction of the usefulness that smartphones have PERIOD They are extensions of your smartphone requiring your phones data to run apps from it because apparently your pocket is too far to reach PERIOD

Far from the versatility of the smartphone the Apple Watch largely functions as a glorified BlackBerry with fitness tracking features PERIOD The features listed in the product listing on Apples website are primarily scheduling contacts watch faces and fitness PERIOD It also lists being able to pay for purchases with your smartwatch but smartphones already do that PERIOD Weve been using our iPhones and Androids for fitness for quite some time now and cell phones have had schedules and contact lists since the dark age of flipphones PERIOD Nobody wants a BlackBerry with a threeinch screen PERIOD

They Represent Illogical AppleMania

In  Apple ran a commercial advertising the Macintosh computer drawing from George Orwells dystopian novel . it showed a society held captive by Thought Police listening to a Big Brother figure speak until a young rebel throws a sledgehammer through the television screen PERIOD The commercial which has since been considered a masterpiece in advertising is a perfect example of Apples marketing strategy at the timeto be different PERIOD They wanted people to believe that if you wanted to be different you would buy Apple products PERIOD

Nearly  years later Apple has become what they claimed to fight PERIOD It is Apple not Windows that has become the mainstream choice of gadgetusers across the world PERIOD Instead of telling users to be different and choose Apple they expect everyone to buy the new Apple product simply because its Apple PERIOD

This is a case of Applemania the insistence that everything Apple releases must be brilliant because its Apple PERIOD The consumerism that surrounds these products is becoming ridiculous PERIOD Our culture has become so obsessed with technology that we somehow need to make common household objects like watches and glasses into gadgets we can show off and boast about PERIOD It shows a further intrusion of technology into our everyday lives leaving us to wonder how far they will go next time PERIOD

Hopefully the smart coffee cup will remain an abstract idea that visits me in my nightmares PERIOD
