In the beginning of the semester we the staff at the Skiff said we wanted to implement some changes to incorporate the reader more into the paper.We started an entertainment page focused on weekend highlights PERIOD

We are working on consistently publishing Campus Lines on Tuesdays to give an overview of the weeks events and important information PERIOD

And now we want to hear from you PERIOD

Our new implementation is an occasional Readers Corner on the Etc PERIOD page PERIOD

What is Readers Corner Well have you ever had a random thought like why do they call a door ajar when it obviously is not a jar Do you like writing poetry short stories or jokes Or do you like photography or drawing

Thats Readers Corner PERIOD Its whatever you want it to be PERIOD Its a chance to express yourself PERIOD Its randomness PERIOD Its fun PERIOD And best of all its all about you PERIOD

We want your creativity to be displayed PERIOD We want the paper to be as interactive with the TCU community as possible and we think this is a good way to do it PERIOD

If you want to submit anything for Readers Corner email it to emailprotected and make sure to specify what it is for in the subject line PERIOD

Just remember we have the right to not publish something depending on space and content PERIOD
