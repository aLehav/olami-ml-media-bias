Updated November     pm



During the UWs Saturday scrimmage spectators saw something that hasnt been seen around Montlake in an awfully long time a tight end streak downfield stopping to throw a fake and freeze his defender before continuing on his route PERIOD

As the ball left quarterback Nick Montanas hand freshman Austin SeferianJenkins leapt in the air twisting his body between two defenders PERIOD Despite the double coverage SeferianJenkins used his body as a shield and latched onto the ball even managing to grind out an extra couple of yards on the ground PERIOD

With that one play SeferianJenkins added one more piece to head football coach Steve Sarkisians renovation of Washington football PERIOD

SeferianJenkins catch heralded the return of Tight End U. back when the UW produced a bevy of quality tight ends PERIOD

SeferianJenkins who graduated high school early and has been at the UW all of two weeks made several other catches as did fellow tight end redshirt freshman Michael Hartvigson PERIOD

The stellar play of these two young tight ends is quickly adding a dimension to the UW offense that hasnt been seen since Cam Cleeland Mark Bruener and Jerramy Stevens were lining up offtackle PERIOD

In this scrimmage alone the two certainly amassed significantly more receiving yards than the  produced by the UWs tight ends all last year PERIOD

 Sarkisian said of SeferianJenkins and Hartvigson PERIOD 

A reliable tight end is a safety valve for a quarterback giving him a big target to throw to when other options fail PERIOD It was a luxury that former quarterback Jake Locker was without certainly contributing to his relatively low completion percentage and perceived accuracy concerns PERIOD

Luckily for the UWs next quarterback  almost certainly Montana a redshirt freshman or Keith Price a redshirt sophomore  this crucial part of offensive arsenal wont be missing PERIOD

 Sarkisian explained PERIOD

All of the UWs tight ends are young and there are bound to be some growing pains but the positives this season are sure to outweigh the negatives PERIOD While SeferianJenkins and Hartvigson have impressed in the passing game both have the size to also be a factor in the running game PERIOD

A good blocking tight end who can occupy a linebacker can do wonders for a teams rushing game PERIOD This bodes well for junior running back Chris Polk as he sets out to surpass his stellar numbers from last season PERIOD

It used to be that a tight end with a degree from the UW was assured an NFL job PERIOD After years without a dominant tight end it looks like the Huskies reputation is about to be restored PERIOD
