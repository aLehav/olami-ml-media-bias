Minor Threat Blockers pictured in white try and defend against the Gem City Jammers jammer pictured in teal PERIOD

The Minor Threat Junior Roller Derby Team made up of  skaters and three coaches started their first bout ever against the Gem City Jammers dressed up head to toe in protective padding May  PERIOD Being the first junior league in the Metro East area their opponents had to travel from Quincy only for Minor Threat to defeat the Jammers  PERIOD

Minor Threat has been practicing for a little under a year PERIOD They are gender neutral and welcome skaters ages  to  PERIOD The team has a strict Skate Dont Hate policy and is against bullying of any form PERIOD

Elizabeth Jefferson known as Coach Pink of Rifle Co. and Stacey Tiggard known as Mommy Dearest of Milwaukee Wi. were the ones to get the ball rolling PERIOD

The sport itself is played in a series of jams that make up what is called a bout PERIOD Each jam is about two minutes long and the whole event takes close to two hours PERIOD The goal is to have the most points which are earned by the jammer PERIOD

Each team has five players on the track at a time PERIOD This pack includes a jammer a pivot and three blockers PERIOD

The jammer position takes a higher skill level as they have to outrace the other teams jammer PERIOD The faster of the two gets the title of Lead Jammer and the power to terminate the jam at any moment PERIOD

To earn points the jammer has to slide past other teams blockers and pivot and race the other jammer to complete a full pass PERIOD Once that is completed the jammer gets a point for every player passed PERIOD The pivot leads the blockers and barks out orders PERIOD

The game may seem pretty simple but according to the parents it takes a tough kid to make it happen PERIOD Most skaters had previous experience with the sport from living in other areas in the country PERIOD When they came to the St PERIOD Louis area they were disappointed with the lack of a junior league so they started one PERIOD

Most of the parents were derby girls themselves PERIOD Coaches Hope Starr known as Coach Tory and Jefferson both have children on the team PERIOD Most of them played for Confluence Crush Roller Derby of St PERIOD Louis but some played for other teams PERIOD

I had my own kids and they had nowhere to go Jefferson said PERIOD Roller derby is one of the fastest growing sports in the world. cynthia Pesquira was part of a league in California and was known as Latin Sin PERIOD Out of four sons two of them chose to follow her legacy PERIOD The older of the two rolled by the name Son of Sin and her other son participated in the bout as Bloody Knuckles. pesquira said her youngest chose the name because his real name is Nicholas and it sounds similar to knuckles PERIOD She has gotten to see each of the skaters grow as theyve practiced for the last year PERIOD

Theyve just come so far PERIOD These kids are really tough Pesquira said PERIOD They have to work hard and its hard to be out there. jefferson said the sport is about learning how to use each other as teammates PERIOD The jammer is the one scoring the points but they cant score any without some help PERIOD

Some skaters are better at jamming Jefferson said PERIOD We try to let them show off their skills but everyone can work up to that level. another jammer is Laney Bug who is one of the smaller kids on the team PERIOD Her mom Jami Fritz plays for Crush as Jam it Ginger. we originally moved here from Hawaii PERIOD She is  years old but has been doing this since she was . fritz said PERIOD It just seemed to work out. tiggards daughter Skylar also plays for Minor Threat PERIOD She chose the name Bat Hit Crazy and is the team captain PERIOD

My daughter really wanted to play roller derby Tiggard said PERIOD There are three adult derby leagues but they didnt have junior leagues. soon enough after moving to the area she got into contact with Jefferson and they found other skaters to start the team PERIOD After having some trouble finding a sponsor they raised funds by starting a bootcamp for six weeks with  kids and have been practicing ever since PERIOD

The team now practices twice a week once on Fridays in St PERIOD Peters Mo. and on Sundays in Troy at the Spin City Skate Center PERIOD

Our league is  percent dedicated to kids Tiggard said PERIOD We only support junior derby PERIOD Our kids come first. jefferson said she wanted others to know the team is here they are growing and anyone can play roller derby regardless of their athleticism PERIOD

Weve had skaters starting out not even knowing how to skate and now theyre some of the best jammers Jefferson said PERIOD We are always evolving and always welcoming new skaters. minor Threat has a specific person Nicole Polen better known as Coach Java that takes new skaters under her wing according to Tiggard PERIOD

Wed like to be known as a welcoming place that instills confidence teamwork and social skills Jefferson said PERIOD It gives them an opportunity to be around likeminded kids. editorinChief
