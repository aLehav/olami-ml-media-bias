Its a secret PERIOD

Im an open person it is quite possible that I share more than I should PERIOD

Still I always hold a number of secrets at any given time PERIOD

I remember when I was in the middle school and distinctly felt that until I told my girlfriends about something it hadnt truly happened PERIOD My younger self thought the mere act of reenvisioning an occasion by transferring your experience verbally somehow solidified its existence PERIOD

I still experience this urge to  the things I experience but now Ive come to the realization that exposing my secrets is not always in my best interest PERIOD

For one the obvious inevitable exposure of your secret promises the verbal transfer will occur eventually PERIOD I do not believe secrets can remain buried forever even if they become exposed years later PERIOD

They will end up exposed and bare bringing back unwanted emotions for secrets are secrets for reasons PERIOD

We are all to blame for this casualty PERIOD

Im not going to be a hypocrite and say that I never told others secrets PERIOD I think we can all admit we divulge secrets because they are secrets for a reasonraw juiciness PERIOD I enjoy story time with my crosscountry friends repeating the theatrical lives of my Tennessee tribe PERIOD

Even though they dont know Jack and Jill Im still telling someone they went up the hill PERIOD

On the other side of the whisper sometimes the secret you must keep is the betrayal of someone elses secretkeeper in the first place 

I get this precursor often PERIOD If we could track a secret Id bet it gets around to a dozen people in a dozen daysfor every person you tell they probably tell two more PERIOD

Our secret clienteles inability to keep their mouths shut is reason enough not to spill the beans but our clienteles appreciation for our secrets proves much more demeaning PERIOD

Secrets are secrets because they hold weight in your psyche and expose a litany of vulnerabilities your biggest mistakes shameful encounters precious moments prideful exhibitions and passionate ideas on life PERIOD

Nothing is worse than undressing your thoughts while your friend SnapChats or interrupts your giftgiving with mindless drivel 

I redress myself and move along PERIOD

After sharing a secret with someone who doesnt cherish it as much as I do I feel perturbed inside as if I someone walked in on me changing PERIOD They shouldnt have seen what they sawnow they know parts about me that I wish they didnt PERIOD

You cannot take back what you have said just as you cannot erase what someone sees PERIOD

Ive kept a journal since middle school and yes Ive reread them I had to despite the embarrassment PERIOD I had to read my secrets because otherwise I would never have satisfied the beliefs of my younger self the girl who needed to share her secrets with someone PERIOD

Ive also confided in a few people different people for different secrets and only those that understand the vulnerability of the raw self PERIOD

Before you get all excited about revolutionary experiences thoughts and actions in your life hold onto your secret for a few days PERIOD Instead write it down and wait for the perfect person in the perfect moment PERIOD

When someone addresses you with valued information be there for him or her PERIOD Listen PERIOD Put your phone down and dont interrupt PERIOD It is not hard to tell when someone is stripping in front of youvulnerability is written all over his or her face dripping from their tone moving within their body language PERIOD They are naked PERIOD

Whether beautiful or shameful respect the openness PERIOD Close your mouth PERIOD
