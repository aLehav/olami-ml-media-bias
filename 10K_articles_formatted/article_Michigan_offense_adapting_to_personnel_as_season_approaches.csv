Of the countless memorable moments during John Beileins tenure at Michigan two timeless images stand above the rest PERIOD They are of course Trey Burke stepping back and releasing an inchperfect shot over the outstretched arms of Kansas Kevin Young in  and Jordan Poole legs spread flailing to the floor at the buzzer as his shot propelled the Wolverines past Houston in last years tournament PERIOD

There are plenty of differences between the two shots but the important thing is what the they have in common  both came from 3point range PERIOD Thats not a coincidence  3point shooting has always been a core identity for Beileins Michigan teams PERIOD

And hes always had the personnel to match PERIOD Burke Tim Hardaway Jr. Derrick Walton and Moritz Wagner all of whom rank among the Wolverines biggest stars under Beilein were prolific from beyond the arc PERIOD

This years team is completely different PERIOD Beyond Poole Beileins biggest offensive weapons will be junior point guard Zavier Simpson redshirt junior forward Charles Matthews and freshman forward Ignas Brazdeikis none of whom have proven an ability to shoot 3pointers at the collegiate level PERIOD

Lets face it we lost our three top shooters from last year Beilein said at his first press conference of the season PERIOD Thats a lot of threes in those three and highpercentage guys so we have to replace that somehow. part of Michigans adaptation to its lack of 3point shooting will be a heavy reliance on its suffocating defense PERIOD But it might also do something unprecedented under Beilein  predicate its offense on getting to the basket PERIOD

Getting downhill I think thats gonna be our identity right now said assistant coach DeAndre Haynes PERIOD

The Wolverines have added new sets on offense to better match their personnel PERIOD Michigans identity may center around its defensive prowess but its offensive talent isnt weak just different PERIOD

Brazdeikis was the teams top scorer in its three exhibitions in Spain this summer PERIOD He flashed that ability again at Mondays open practice finishing a silky reverse layup through traffic on an otherwise quiet day PERIOD

Iggy hes like a I dont know what you want to call him hes just barbaric Haynes said PERIOD Like hes just one of those dudes that once he gets into the paint hes tough to guard. matthews is known as a defensive standout but he began to display his scoring ability last March when he averaged . points per game in the Wolverines run to the national championship PERIOD Even in his best offensive stretch of the season he scored by getting to the basket and hitting shortrange jumpers PERIOD Just four of his  made baskets in the NCAA Tournament came from beyond the arc PERIOD

The key to Michigans new offensive identity might be Simpson PERIOD As Beileins point guard the offense runs through him PERIOD His offense was often criticized last year when he shot just . percent from deep at the point guard position  a role previously occupied by Walton and Burke PERIOD But 3point shooting just isnt Simpsons game PERIOD

Zavier hes one of the best guards at getting downhill PERIOD You know everyday we work on different finishes Haynes said PERIOD If we can get him a little 15footer pullup that would be great PERIOD

But right now everything with a floater  or we call it a three oclock nine oclock finish at the wide layups  hes probably one of the best guards Ive seen finish those types of layups in the country. beilein admits his teams 3point shooting needs to improve PERIOD The subject has dominated preseason headlines PERIOD

He also knows that this offense is unlike any other that he has had at Michigan PERIOD And that might mean venturing into uncharted territory PERIOD

Thats the genius of coach Beilein said assistant coach Saddi Washington PERIOD Hes always tweaking the offense to the strength of the personnel whether its our shooting whether its our guys ability to get downhill coach is masterful at adjusting the offense so that its the strength of our personnel. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
