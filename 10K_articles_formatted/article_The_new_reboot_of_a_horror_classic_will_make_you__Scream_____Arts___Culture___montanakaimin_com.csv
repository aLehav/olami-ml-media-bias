Do you like scary movies

This past week after more than  years the Scream series released its fifth installment a requel as the characters in the movie call it PERIOD Not quite a reboot and not quite a sequel 2022s Scream picks up the plot years later with some allnew characters and horror royalty PERIOD

But there are certain rules a horror requel must follow PERIOD Lets see if Scream can cut it PERIOD

Rule number one A horror requel HAS to use the original title of the film PERIOD

Friday the thirteenth. halloween. childs Play. candyman. no no no this isnt Scream . its Scream. dont mix that up again PERIOD

Result Pass PERIOD

Rule number two A horror requel needs to introduce exciting new characters while paying tribute to the franchise classics PERIOD

Melissa Barrera budding actress known from recent hit In the Heights joins the cast in her first stint as a scream queen PERIOD Her character Sam is revealed to be the daughter of Billy Loomis the original killer from the classic film PERIOD This puts her at the center of another massacre courtesy of the allnew Ghostface PERIOD

Barrera is joined by Jenna Ortega The Babysitter Killer Queen Jack Quaid The Hunger Games and Dylan Minnette Thirteen Reasons Why along with a slew of other teenage actors that are sure to make you point to the screen and say Hey Werent they in that one thing While the new players have yet to gain the notoriety of the OG cast they are charismatic enough to carry some weight PERIOD Luckily some old friends stopped by to help out PERIOD

Neve Campbell Courteney Cox and David Arquette all return to their iconic roles making them the only actors to appear in all five Scream films PERIOD They jump back into the characters with ease PERIOD You know what they say you never forget how to ride a bike or take multiple stab wounds PERIOD

Result Pass PERIOD

Rule number three A horror requel needs to up the action the mystery and most importantly the gore PERIOD

Like many a horror franchise the Scream films ran out of steam as time passed Im looking at you Scream  PERIOD The chase scenes felt tired PERIOD The whodunnits felt lazy PERIOD The kills were downright unforgivable PERIOD Luckily this requel feels like a shot of tequila after the last two installments PERIOD

The characters are used perfectly in terms of making them come across as suspects PERIOD Throughout the film your prediction for who the killer is will flop back and forth again and again until you start suspecting yourself PERIOD

And whats even better is that such a large cast means there is LOTS of room for casualties a handful of which will undoubtedly become icons in the horror canon PERIOD A scene in a hospital midway through the movie is near perfect and the final act will have your heart racing like youre in the house with them PERIOD

Result Pass PERIOD

Rule number four the final rule A horror requel needs to love the original PERIOD

For some reason this is the hardest rule for these movies to follow PERIOD Iconic horror titles are often used at the center of moneygrabbing schemes PERIOD Its becoming harder to find horror films made with a little TLC PERIOD

But as soon as the film begins and the familiar voice comes through the phone youll know for a fact that these filmmakers know what theyre doing PERIOD

Scream is a movie worthy of its name all culminating in a final For Wes before the credits roll a dedication to Wes Craven the late director behind iconic horror films like A Nightmare on Elm Street The Hills Have Eyes and of course Scream. it was all for him PERIOD

Result Pass with flying colors PERIOD
