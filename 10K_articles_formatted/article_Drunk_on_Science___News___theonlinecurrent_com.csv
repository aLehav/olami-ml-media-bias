Mainly clear PERIOD Low near 60F PERIOD Winds NNE at  to  mph PERIOD

Updated November     pm



I found joy living in Florida which was the warmest state in the U.S PERIOD this past winter especially because I was able to see how my friends and family reacted to their own living arrangements PERIOD

My sister came down from Boston to visited me for a couple of days PERIOD During her stay she absorbed as much sunlight as she could before heading back PERIOD After sailing sleeping on beaches and lots of reading outside she wasnt excited about heading back up north PERIOD Boston had what some would call a fair amount of snow this winter PERIOD My sister told me that the city felt like it was buried PERIOD But what if Boston was actually buried The entire city could be preserved PERIOD It would have to happen really fast like a frosty Pompeii PERIOD

In geology permafrost is soil that is kept below the freezing temperature of water for at least two years PERIOD French scientists have recently been studying this in Siberia PERIOD Within the permafrost they found an ancient virus which is at least  years old PERIOD Surprisingly the virus became infectious again after thawing PERIOD

However the virus found wasnt harmful to humans PERIOD This raises the question of whether we can find more dangerous viruses within the permafrost PERIOD But wait The scientists stated that they were not certain if this could happen with other viruses if they are even found PERIOD This reminds me of going backpacking in the mountains PERIOD Sometimes the ground in some rivers would be so cold we would bury a beer in the ground and when we came back from our trip it would be ice cold PERIOD

The ability of frost to preserve things is endlessly fascinating PERIOD Do we ever stop to marvel at how refrigerators work There is a special brand of fridges that work with a gel PERIOD The gel holds your food in place and keeps it cool without needing a power source PERIOD This is because it uses zero energy meaning it uses the energy that it produces PERIOD Although I dont see many people feeling comfortable putting their food into neon green gel they would at least be able to use it for deadly viruses PERIOD Preferably wed want to preserve things that are not ancient deadly viruses and illnesses PERIOD

To go back to the recent permafrost discovery I wouldnt worry about the virus PERIOD Even if these deadly viruses were brought back they would be extensively damaged and weakened from the temperature shift PERIOD Still the fact that these viruses continued to live on after so long is worth marvelling at PERIOD The next time you walk around in a wintry wonderland be mindful of what could be hiding underneath PERIOD
