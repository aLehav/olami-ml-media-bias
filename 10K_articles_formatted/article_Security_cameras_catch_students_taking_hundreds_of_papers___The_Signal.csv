For the second time this year a large number of newspapers were taken from The Signal stands PERIOD

At  p.m PERIOD on Oct PERIOD  only hours after the newspapers hit the stands three unidentified males were captured on security cameras taking three large stacks of newspapers about  copies PERIOD

The Signal has filed a police report with the Georgia State University Police Department and an incident report with the Office of the Dean of Students PERIOD

Earlier in the year on May  a similar incident occurred where a group of female students were seen dumping approximately  newspapers into a recycling bin PERIOD

After the first incident occurred The Signal filed an incident report with the Office of the Dean of Students PERIOD The report was dismissed because the university could not find enough evidence that any individuals dumped the copies of The Signal PERIOD

The Student Judicial Board also weighed in on the case saying that the trashing of the  newspapers was not a theft since students have the right to trash as many papers as they want PERIOD

Its open its accessible to everyone Allison Renyi former chief justice of the Student Judicial Board told The Signal in May PERIOD As one student while it would be grossly unfair of me I could take every single one of the papers because as a student those papers are mine. attorney Advocate of the Student Press Law Center Adam Goldstein argues otherwise PERIOD

Theft isnt measured by the cost of something its measured by value you deprive somebody of Goldstein said PERIOD You deprive everyone of value when you take these newspapers you deprive the readers you deprive the advertisers who paid to get a message out you deprive the newspaper staff who put time into the paper. the GSUPD dismissed the original incident after saying that it was not a crime because the papers were recovered later on PERIOD

If an officer cannot recognize that the taking of newspapers is a crime then he should just give up his badge and go work in fast food Goldstein said PERIOD

A disclaimer was printed in each copy of The Signal after the incident that states that the first copy of The Signal is free PERIOD Additional copies can be purchased from our office for . each. according to Rebecca Stout associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students the disclaimer that is in The Signal creates a stronger case that the actions of the three individuals were a violation of the student code of conduct PERIOD

Newspaper theft has become a current threat to student papers in Georgia PERIOD There were  reported cases of newspaper theft in  alone according to a map created by the SPLC PERIOD

As of press time The Signal has requested further review of surveillance tapes in the University Student Center PERIOD

UPDATE

As of Oct PERIOD  two of the individuals in the picture have admitted to taking large amounts ofSignal newspapers PERIOD Riley Gillison the white male to the left of the screen came intoThe Signal on Oct PERIOD  and toldSignal editors that he was responsible for taking the copies of the newspaper PERIOD

I thought I could just take some newspapers to make my Halloween costume and some arts and crafts to decorate my house back home Gillison said PERIOD

When asked if he had any proof of his statement Gillison said he was not big on photos. gillison agreed to bring in the costume that he made with the newspapers on Oct PERIOD  though hehas yet to bring in any proof PERIOD

On Oct PERIOD  Christopher B PERIOD Walker the black male to the right of Gillison in the picture came intoThe Signal and admitted to helping Gillison take the newspapers PERIOD

We just took it for arts and crafts Walker said PERIOD Gillison just asked me to help him. as of press time the third individual has not been identified PERIOD





The same thing happened at ccsu . pERIOD The soccer coach was caught notkidding just google it

Im not mad that some students took it upon themselves to save the entire student body from having to read extremely poor journalism PERIOD What type of school newspaper would create an article entitled Why We Suck the purpose of a school newspaper should be to uplift the student body not bring it down PERIOD Heres a newsflash for the Signal staff You Suck

It should be clarified that student newspapers and the media in general are not obligated to be anybodys cheerleader because it would violate journalism code of ethics PERIOD
Also here is a recent post about this very subject httpcollegemediamatters.com20121104shouldstudentmediabecheerleadersforschoolssportsteamshintno

Regardless the Signal is terrible PERIOD  Horrible journalism that is funded through student fees PERIOD

 SignalEditor Regardless the Signal is doing a horrible job PERIOD How do you expect students to have any type of pride in our school when you all are writing demeaning headlines like Why We Suck in the newspaper that is totally UNACCEPTABLE PERIOD Signal Editor I would like you to explain why that is acceptable PERIOD Not to mention one of your writers wrote a story on how our Fight Song which is great sounds horrible and needs to be changed PERIOD You all just slapped all  members of our talented marching band in the face with that article PERIOD For the record our marching band sounds GREAT playing the fight song PERIOD As a student in the School of Music I was shocked and appalled that someone would wtrite something like that PERIOD Im just asking that you all be a little more sensitive and conscientious when you write articles PERIOD Thank you PERIOD

Im going to push back here PERIOD As someone who has been at Georgia State for quite a while I can say that the Signal has come along away over the past few years PERIOD When I first started here the Signal was just not very interesting PERIOD There werent any inflamatory or controversial reports but only because the paper was essentially a giant PR pamphlet and not a very good one PERIOD The articles were poorly written and the overall quality of the content was pretty low PERIOD There were hardly any investigative reports about student fees and certainly no assessments of the effectiveness of the student government and university administration PERIOD It was increadibly frustating to see the schools newspaper fall into irrelevance and obscurity when there was so much potential for the Signal to be a major voice for student concerns as well as a venue for thoughtprovoking and controversial writing on certain aspects of the university PERIOD

That being said Im glad to see that people are actually reading the Signal now even if they disagree with the nature of its content PERIOD Its actually touching on some controversial topics and raising eyebrows rather than falling into easy and banal patterns of platitudes and empty PR catchphrases PERIOD If thats the kind of thing you enjoy in an independent school newspaper then I actually feel sorry for you PERIOD It must be pretty dull having your own opinions and preferences constantly confirmed in boring prose PERIOD Saying that criticisms of certain aspects of the school in the editorial section somehow dampens school pride seems like a criticism devoid of content PERIOD Even the phrase school pride just looks like another empty catchphrase to me PERIOD Im proud to be a GSU student but not because I think the school can do wrong PERIOD I dont feel any kind of nationalistic allegiance to GSU and I dont think its the universitys job to instill that in me PERIOD Im proud of the education I received and the critical thinking skills that I learned PERIOD To the extent that GSU as an institution made the unique education I received possible I feel proud to have been part of that institution PERIOD To the extent that GSU instituted policies that detracted from my education I am critical and I dont see the recent articles in the Signal as doing anything other than being critical in this way PERIOD It seems like a university should foster critical thinking at all levels rather than constantly affirming how great it is and how special its students are PERIOD

TLDR Id rather have a paper that publishes critical investigations and controversial editorials than one that simply repeats empty PR for the university PERIOD

Comments are closed PERIOD
