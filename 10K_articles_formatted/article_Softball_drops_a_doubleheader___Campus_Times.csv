Although the winter weather conditions have made it tough for the softball team to take the field on a regular basis the Yellowjackets managed to fit in a doubleheader against SUNY Brockport April  PERIOD

UR dropped both contests as the teams struggles continue PERIOD

The first game was all Brockport as the Golden Eagles shut out UR  PERIOD

Brockport pitcher Kristen Clark was one of the most foreboding elements of the game PERIOD

She was hitting her location and kept us on balance the whole game junior and captain Sara Dial said PERIOD That was the biggest challenge in the first game. what was most significant according to senior Meredith Gray was a lack of team play and communication PERIOD

Because of all the cancelations and postponements the Yellowjackets have not had as many opportunities to gel on the diamond and develop team chemsitry PERIOD

We just were not working together Gray said PERIOD

UR was outhit  in the first game and committed two defensive errors in the field PERIOD

With the opening loss behind them the Yellowjackets geared up for the nightcap PERIOD

While the results were much better for UR the outcome was not as the Yellowjackets fell to Brockport  PERIOD

The team pinpointed its improved concentration in the second game as one of the key reasons for the improvement PERIOD

We carried more confidence Dial said PERIOD We were playing our game and we controlled the tempo in the batters box PERIOD It made a big difference. the Yellowjackets were also able to settle in better the second game and focus on playing smart fundamentally sound softball PERIOD UR capitalized on Brockports mistakes as all but one of the runs allowed by the Golden Eagles were unearned PERIOD

Junior captain Tracy Simon brought in the first run during the second inning on a double PERIOD The third inning brought in three runs for UR with senior Val Palermo freshman Anne OBrien and Dial each crossing home PERIOD

But that would not be enough as the Yellowjackets never led PERIOD Brockport put an insurance run on the board in the top of the seventh PERIOD UR was unable to answer in the bottom half of the frame PERIOD

The squad looks to compete against Keuka College SUNY Buffalo SUNY Geneseo and Skidmore College in upcoming games PERIOD The dates and times are still uncertain due to the winter weather PERIOD

Every spring sport is up in the air not knowing who to play and when Gray said PERIOD  It is hard to mentally prepare yourself with this uncertainty PERIOD Were trying to keep it fun and not let it get too monotonous PERIOD  Youve got to roll with the punches and expect to play any day. they Yellowjackets have not played well since returning to Rochester following their trip to Florida for the University Athletic Association Championships PERIOD UR has yet to record a win up north with its only two victories coming against Case Western Reserve University PERIOD
