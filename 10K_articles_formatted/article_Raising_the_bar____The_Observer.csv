ANN MARIE JAKUBOWSKI  Friday December  



Since taking office April  student body president and vice president Alex Coccia and Nancy Joyce have checked off items left and right PERIOD

Recent initiatives included supporting University admissions policies to welcome undocumented students to campus a week of awareness for mental health issues facing students and a coffee cart installed in DeBartolo Hall all of which were goals included in their campaign platform PERIOD Though they have made progress through the concrete todo list Joyce said they are most proud of their success in engaging students who were not typically involved in student government PERIOD

Im really proud of the fact that weve gotten a lot of involvement from people even outside of any sort of formalized committees Joyce said PERIOD I think weve done a pretty good job of trying to involve people who have opinions but who arent necessarily interested in being involved with student government and thats really what we wanted to do from Day One. coccia said personal oneonone interaction with members of the Notre Dame community has been key to his administrations policymaking PERIOD

Even at the very beginning we focused on how we approach oneonone meetings and making sure were doing a lot of those with students and administrators to not only get initiatives going but also to build important relationships he said PERIOD We do that every week with both administrators and students and that has just come in immensely handy and has just been a powerful powerful method for really working with students to get change going and build trust. setting a standard

Engaging in social media and working to reach students where they are has been a crucial aspect of the administrations leadership Coccia said PERIOD Joyce said during their term they have been trying to raise the expectations of what student government should be on campus. i think weve made a very concerted effort to engage freshmen which is really important because now for the next four years the expectation of that and of every successive class is for a student government that reaches out to them and gives personal invitations to various invitations a group that is known to them she said PERIOD On a more macro level of what student government is weve really tried to make it something that people can expect a lot from and that we deliver on it PERIOD

Hopefully going forward that bar has been raised a little bit. juan Rangel chief of staff for this years administration said he has been pleasantly surprised by the level of student involvement and cooperation on campus PERIOD

Students are really engaged on campus not necessarily in a formalized way but even just in the ways that we can reach them whether through social networks like Facebook and Twitter or in events that we host Rangel said PERIOD Students are more aware that student government is active and that were actively trying to meet their needs in any way PERIOD I think thats definitely something to be proud of. using the momentum

Coccia said he attributes much of the groups success in tackling the initiatives on the platform to the constant connection and interaction between members of the executive cabinet and with students outside the organization PERIOD

If someone sends us an idea were typically going to follow up on that and try to get a better sense of what their thoughts are and how they see student government fitting into that he said PERIOD I think the sexual assault initiatives are a great example of that PERIOD We definitely had that on our platform but as something that we wanted to work on in whatever capacity we could. joyce said when examining ideas and reviewing priorities at the end of the day they always go back to the platform. but at the same time I think theres been a lot thats come up since weve been in office that had been generated by people coming up to us and saying Look I have this idea or I see this happening this way and I think we need that she said PERIOD We make that a priority. the relationships built between administrators and student government have proven really encouraging Coccia said PERIOD

Ultimately I think administrators are impressed by student ideas and so when we bring something to them like the coffee cart idea more often than not they want to get it done he said PERIOD Where student government comes in is just to be the best partner we can. rangel said their work often opens their eyes to the inner workings of the University providing a unique view on the behindthescenes action PERIOD Coccia said he finds the activity across the strata exciting PERIOD

Its certainly been encouraging for me to see on all levels of the University the number of moving parts on various initiatives he said PERIOD It really does become kind of a team effort across the University because as students were all here to have a great learning experience and learning environment and the administrators know that students are the reason theyre here as well. reviewing the semester

Although the group members are pleased with their work to date Joyce said they will revisit and review their remaining agenda items to pick up after winter break PERIOD

When we started we had this huge platform of things we wanted to get done and we have gotten a lot done but we certainly think that there are more things for us to accomplish she said PERIOD Part of being efficient in the next three months will be picking some of those things and prioritizing some of them PERIOD

I think that we may not get every single thing checked off of our platform so we want to make sure that were getting as much done as we can and doing the most things that students feel are important. coccia said he hopes the recommendations made in the Oct PERIOD  report to the Student Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees will help sustain some of the longterm projects beyond the oneyear time frame in which they will hold office PERIOD

Hopefully this and the next board report in May will lay a blueprint of recommendations for future administrations he said PERIOD Ultimately what were trying to do is address the issues and bring the conversation up in a way that is going to prolong it and make sure it is sustained. to increase the scope of projects collaboration with groups outside student government has been a huge success Joyce said PERIOD

Weve really tried to reach out to lots of different people in the dorms all the clubs and the administration she said PERIOD I think its important to realize that student government can work with other people. above and beyond

In addition to representing the student body Coccia was a  Truman scholar and a finalist for both the Rhodes and the Marshall scholarships PERIOD Joyce said his leadership so far has exemplified setting the tone at the top. alex would never say this because hes too humble but the leadership comes from the top and his getitdone attitude and his ability to really go out and figure out what it is that we can be doing is where the inspiration comes from for everybody else she said PERIOD I doubt that there are very many people on campus who dont recognize Alex and I think that really says a lot PERIOD

Hes done such an incredible job of getting out and talking to people oneonone and making people feel like their concerns are our concerns because they are PERIOD I know as a team theres a lot that weve done but it certainly would not be the same without him so I hope people know that. coccia said the group is enjoying every day and is excited to return to campus in January to finish the term strong PERIOD

Were loving it PERIOD Were having a lot of fun he said PERIOD There are certainly frustrating days and I think we recognize that things sometimes take more time than what we want but its been really fun. grade A



The CocciaJoyce administration has exceeded their goal of raising the expectation of what student government should be on campus as Joyce said PERIOD Having enacted tangible changes they have already left a unique legacy on Notre Dame and have set a new standard of excellence in the student government office PERIOD The accessible and energetic leadership style exemplified by Coccia Joyce and their cabinet makes them effective leaders and connects them to their constituents needs PERIOD
