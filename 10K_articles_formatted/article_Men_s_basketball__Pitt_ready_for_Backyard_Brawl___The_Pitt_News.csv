The Pitt mens basketball team has been in a relatively unfamiliar position this past The Pitt mens basketball team has been in a relatively unfamiliar position this past week PERIOD

Coming off a  loss at St PERIOD Johns on Saturday the past few days marked only the third time this season that the Panthers have had to prepare for a game while recovering from a loss PERIOD

You learn from wins and you learn from losses Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon said in a news conference this week PERIOD Were still in a pretty good position. despite falling one point short at Madison Square Garden against St PERIOD Johns Pitt   Big East enters tonights muchanticipated Backyard Brawl against West Virginia at the Petersen Events Center with a twogame lead in the Big East standings PERIOD

We know whats at stake against West Virginia PERIOD We want to come out and win this Big East season championship and we know we can do that these last four games Pitt senior forward Gilbert Brown said PERIOD So we have to come out and make a statement and play really aggressive and play together on Thursday. the Panthers can also take solace in the fact that junior guard and leading scorer Ashton Gibbs who played at St PERIOD Johns and scored a careerhigh  points after missing the previous three games with an MCL injury will play in his first home game since Pitt defeated Cincinnati at the Pete on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

Pitt has also already defeated the rival Mountaineers once this season PERIOD

On Feb PERIOD  in their first game without Gibbs the Panthers traveled to a tough environment in Morgantown W.Va. and emerged with a gutsy  win with four Pitt players scoring in double figures PERIOD

West Virginia   Big East comes into the second Backyard Brawl of the season having recorded one of its biggest wins of the year in its last game PERIOD

Having lost three of their previous four games the Mountaineers responded and comfortably beat thenNo PERIOD  Notre Dame  Saturday in Morgantown W.Va PERIOD

I thought we played with a lot of enthusiasm throughout the whole game West Virginia head coach Bob Huggins said after the Notre Dame victory PERIOD This is probably as hard as we have played since the Purdue game for  minutes PERIOD I think everyone we put in played hard. the Mountaineers like Pitt have spent significant time in recent games without their leading scorer PERIOD

West Virginia senior guard Casey Mitchell who is averaging . points per game was suspended for three games by Huggins in January for violating team rules and has seen fewer minutes since his return PERIOD

But Mitchells absence has proved the Mountaineers are far from a oneman team PERIOD

Junior forward Kevin Jones and junior guard Darryl Bryant both average in double figures for West Virginia with . and . points per game respectively PERIOD Senior Joe Mazzulla also helps the Mountaineers in all facets of the game PERIOD The defensiveminded guard averages . points . assists and . rebounds per game PERIOD

It is kind of tough playing against two point guards Pitt sophomore guard Travon Woodall said of Bryant and Mazzulla PERIOD Theyre both able to create for each other or for themselves but weve just got to try to guard everybody the same with the same intensity. thursdays game also marks the first time the two teams have met at the Petersen Events Center since the unforgettable tripleovertime  Pitt victory over then No PERIOD  West Virginia last February PERIOD

But this year the tables have turned on the two programs PERIOD

Like last seasons West Virginia team that would eventually make the Final Four the Panthers have spent most of this year ranked in the top five nationally and enter Thursdays game No PERIOD  in the AP Poll and No PERIOD  in the ESPNUSA Today Coaches Poll PERIOD The Mountaineers come into the showdown unranked although they received votes in both polls PERIOD

Pitt has won nine of the last  at home against West Virginia but last years classic proves that in the Backyard Brawl rankings and records are meaningless PERIOD

We know theyre hungry especially coming off of a win PERIOD They want to prove that they can beat us Brown said PERIOD We have to stay focused stay on our heels and definitely not take them lightly. join our newsletter
