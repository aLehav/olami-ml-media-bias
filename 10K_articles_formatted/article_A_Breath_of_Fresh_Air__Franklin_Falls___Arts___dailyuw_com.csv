During the winter season Franklin Falls gradually freezes creating a remarkable view of immense icicles and frigid water for hikers PERIOD

Editors Note A Breath of Fresh Air is a bimonthly column that unearths local natureescapes embedded in our metropolitan environment and is specifically concerned with highlighting the benefits that spending time in the great outdoors can have on our holistic wellbeing. readjusting to student mode after having two weeks off for winter break can pose a real challenge PERIOD While students are getting back into their school routines and trying not to slip or freeze on their way to class another troublesome problem might arise during this time of year PERIOD

Seasonal Affective Disorder SAD is a type of depression triggered by the change of seasons most likely to occur during fall and winter PERIOD Symptoms of winter depression include oversleeping lack of energy irritability and feelings of heaviness in the arms and legs PERIOD

One of the doityourself remedies for SAD recommended by the Mayo Clinic is simply spending time outdoors PERIOD For best results the clinic recommends getting outside in the mornings within two hours from the time you wake up PERIOD While the cold air may discourage some from spending time outside during winter exercising by walking running or hiking can help your body stay warm PERIOD

While people in the Pacific Northwest have an exceptional abundance of outdoor recreational spots to chose from yearround some of them offer extraspectacular experiences depending on the season PERIOD One such spot near Seattle is Franklin Falls PERIOD

The Franklin Falls hike is gaining popularity and is arguably the most rewarding during winter PERIOD This twomile roundtrip hike leads hikers through a reallife winter wonderland complete with feet of snow giant icicles picturesque cabins nestled in the trees and a partially frozen waterfall PERIOD Elevation gain is minimal and families with kids and dogs often use the trail PERIOD The path runs adjacent to Denny Creek which is accessible and visible along many points along the trail PERIOD The abundance of snow makes this trail especially bright despite the dense tree cover and thus ideal for increasing light exposure PERIOD

After about a mile of hiking on a compact snowcovered trail Franklin Falls will be visible through the trees PERIOD This final leg of the hike requires extra precaution PERIOD To reach the open area at the base of the falls one must hike down a steep icy slope and then walk singlefile across a narrow ledge to reach the snowcovered base of the falls PERIOD Traffic in this area is often heavy due to hikers taking extra time to pass through this segment of the trail PERIOD

Once you have reached the end of the trail you will see an aweinspiring array of icicles of all sizes and possibly even some ice climbers PERIOD The waterfall itself is mostly frozen over though not entirely PERIOD Some crashing water can splash you if you get too close PERIOD The ground at the base of the falls is flat and slippery in places PERIOD If viewed from an angle you can see that the base is actually composed of small to mediumsized rocks hidden by a few feet of snow and ice PERIOD

Located in the Snoqualmie region the Franklin Falls trailhead is approximately a 50minute drive from the UW campus PERIOD Parking fills up quickly so it is best to leave by  a.m PERIOD to ensure close parking and to finish the hike before the early afternoon when it is busiest PERIOD Since work traffic increases on weekday mornings the drive tends to take longer during the week than during weekends PERIOD

Since this trail is covered with snow and ice hikers should dress and pack appropriately PERIOD Wearing waterproof shoes and clothes hand warmers winter accessories and layers will help to make sure this hike is pleasantly comfortable PERIOD Since the trail is slippery in certain places trekking poles and snowshoes are helpful but not necessary PERIOD

Whether you are in need of a break from school a snowy adventure or selfhelp to combat winter depression hiking to Franklin Falls is a perfect choice in the winter season PERIOD
