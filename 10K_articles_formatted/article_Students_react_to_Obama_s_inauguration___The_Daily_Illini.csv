January  

The only noise heard in the Illini Union when Barack Obama took the stage for his presidential inauguration was the rattle of coffee machines from Espresso Royale PERIOD

University students gathered to watch Obamas inauguration filling up the Courtyard Cafe in the Illini Union and making way to the Unions Pine Lounge PERIOD

Although he has class at  a.m. junior in Engineering Christian Sanchez went to the Courtyard Cafe to watch the days festivities PERIOD

I came here to see at least a little bit of how history is made Sanchez said PERIOD

Nirali Shah a junior in LAS was one of the students watching the inauguration in the Pine Lounge because of the crowd in the Courtyard Cafe PERIOD



This inauguration is the start of something really big Shah said PERIOD Obama will do the country a lot of justice. in addition to thinking the speech was inspirational Jacob Lessing junior in Music thought the speech was well prepared as Obama didnt assign blame. a watch party is also ongoing at the Asian American Cultural Center where the inauguration fits in well with the groups mission to promote cultural diversity said Sehjong Hamjong program coordinator at the center PERIOD

Usually when we talk about politics its just a black and white issue but whats special about this inauguration is its inclusive of everyone and everyone is welcome to participate Hamjong said PERIOD

Some students also noticed the events focus on diversity and acceptance of all people PERIOD

I think the inauguration deals with accepting cultures worldwide and it leads the U.S PERIOD to lots of freedom and the openness for anyone to lead us said Jenny Kwak junior in LAS PERIOD

Among the crowd of about  people at the center was graduate student Genevieve Clutario PERIOD

It is pretty exciting to see how diverse the crowd is on TV and that there are so many people our age watching the inauguration Clutario said PERIOD I know for a lot of my friends this is a their first inauguration. the crowd grew at the Asian American Cultural Center as President Obamas speech neared PERIOD

This is the first time Ive felt inspired by a presidential speech said Mickey Mangan senior in Engineering PERIOD Im thoroughly convinced he wont let us down. the speech was markedly different than those by former president George W PERIOD Bush said Oliver Nayapis sophomore in AHS PERIOD

I feel like when I followed President Bush in past years he was lecturing to us where Obama is speaking to us he said PERIOD

The atmosphere was a relaxed one as about  students gathered at the LGBT Resources Center in the Illini Union to watch the speech and other inauguration coverage PERIOD

Graduate student Brent Mochizuki stopped by because he had a class cancelled PERIOD

I like how he called the American public to do their part as well Mochizuki said PERIOD Not just what the government will do but everyone has to do their part. leslie Morrow director of LGBT Resources Center said the group hosted its own inauguration watch party not to be separatist but to create a safe space for members of the LGBT community to watch the event with friends PERIOD She also said many LBGT students have been politically active since the beginning of Obamas campaign PERIOD

Im looking forward to his promises coming full circle Morrow said PERIOD

Mochizuki and Morrow said they disagreed with Obamas choice of Rick Warren as the minister who offered the invocation because his prejudices send the wrong message PERIOD

But Morrow and others added that they are optimistic about what Obamas presidency will mean for the LGBT community PERIOD

Its a change from the last eight years where the LGBT community was voiceless said Louis Ward junior in LAS PERIOD It means we have a seat at the table. grace Kenney Emily Herbick Jill Disis and Erik Allgood contributed to this report PERIOD
