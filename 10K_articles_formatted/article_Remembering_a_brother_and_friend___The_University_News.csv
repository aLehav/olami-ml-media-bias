3639,2018-10-10,"weve all heard the fratboy stereotypes PERIOD

Take you pick the drunk partier never knowing when to call it
quits the overaggressive young man who despite how nicely he
may be told wont accept rejection PERIOD And how could we forget the
togawearing kegcarrying fratforlife individual who thinks
his Greek letters will not only advance him socially but also aid
in his pursuits of that hot freshman girl PERIOD

You laugh but these labels are universal and shape the way
many of us view Greek organizations PERIOD

Last week members of the Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity lost a
fellow brother Brian Muth in a car accident PERIOD As a writer for The
University News I was assigned to interview Muths friends family
and professors and compile a memorial for the SLU community PERIOD

Ive been assigned difficult stories beforeones that left my
mind blank and pen motionless PERIOD But this assignment was hands down
the most challenging PERIOD This would be the last article written about
Muth PERIOD

How could I possibly do him justice

On Monday afternoon I spoke with Kevin Shields president of
Delta Sig and requested an interview with Muths closest friends PERIOD
He organized a gathering that same evening at a restaurant
offcampus PERIOD

Ill admit I wasnt thrilled PERIOD Here I was the newspaper girl
taking on a group of frat boys by myself PERIOD

As I sat with the group of guys who told several stories some
off the record about the friend theyd recently lost I was amazed
by their strength and leadership during this time of tragedy PERIOD

An example sophomore Eric Barr rushed home last Wednesday to be
with the Muth family PERIOD He comforted and cried with them PERIOD He compiled
a CD of pictures for the Muths including various snapshots from
freshman year and a camping trip Barr Muth and three friends went
on earlier this month PERIOD Barr shared several stories of Muth on
Friday nights Muth as the ladies man and Muth as the family
man PERIOD

Barr emphasized how important it was that Muth be remembered for
his vibrancy motivation and desire to succeed PERIOD

Barr doesnt stand alone PERIOD

Twentyseven members of the Delta Sig fraternity traveled four
hours last weekend to Louisville Ky PERIOD to show their support for the
Muth family PERIOD Muths mother who hadnt met the majority of these
individuals was taken aback by their steadfast display of
loyalty PERIOD

Those who werent able to crash at Barrs house for the weekend
rented a hotel room cramming ten guys in one room PERIOD They werent
there for themselves but for everyone else who needed them PERIOD

Even as I spoke with the twentysome individuals who met on
Monday night to share their memories of Muth with me sophomore
Ryan Rooney sat patiently by my side ensuring that quotes were
reported accurately and names spelled correctly PERIOD

After the memorial mass with Fr PERIOD Barry it was the first time I
realized this fraternity thing was really for me said Teddy
Campbell PERIOD

I cant defend fraternities nationwide PERIOD I cant even defend the
many fraternities on SLUs campus PERIOD

I can say however that during this time of horrific tragedy
the men of Delta Sig have come together in a way that should force
us all to reevaluate those longstanding frattastic
misconceptions PERIOD

Muths friends face a hard journey of healing and will
undoubtedly ache in the weeks to come as the reality of his death
continues to sink in PERIOD

But after my brief encounter with this closeknit group of Delta
Sigs I am confident that they will continue to not only show their
support for the Muth family but for each other PERIOD

As Rooney says The only way youre going to get through this
is with the guy next to you. elle Hogan is a junior studying communication PERIOD
