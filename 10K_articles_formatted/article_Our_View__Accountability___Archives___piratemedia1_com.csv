Partly cloudy skies PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



As registration comes to a close we have an idea of the upcoming semester PERIOD We have a class schedule and maybe a sense of what a professor will be like PERIOD Either from a friends recommendation or a high rating on  we show up on the first day with an empty notebook and high expectations PERIOD

When the first day rolls around we sometimes realize that our expectations dont match up with reality PERIOD A professor may be rated highly because they have a slack attendance policy for a boring lecture class or because they constantly cancel class PERIOD Many students are willing to put in effort learn about future skills needed in the real world and want to have a mutual respectful relationship with a professor PERIOD

Professors arent held accountable for these actions at the current time PERIOD Using websites to give them a negative grade doesnt impact them at the university level at all PERIOD The Student Opinion of Instructor Survey SOIS is the only way to reach the higherups about a professors performance and the current survey is limited PERIOD

The majority of the survey is based on a 10point rating scale with additional comments at the bottom PERIOD Most students breeze through it for potential bonus points without putting much thought into the response PERIOD Unless the teacher is one you loathe or love the results can be passive PERIOD

Luckily the Faculty Senate is working on creating a new survey one that focuses on studentteacher relationships and accountability of the professors PERIOD Less vague questions will make students thoughtfully consider a response PERIOD Critiquing slack or disrespectful teachers will not only help students but will help increase the quality of the education at ECU PERIOD

Along with shedding light on the bad teachers those professors who go above and beyond will be given better reviews PERIOD We all have had a teacher who we look forward to seeing in class who pushes students to learn and who makes class engaging PERIOD Associate professors will be able to showcase positive responses and can work toward tenure PERIOD

SOIS results arent made public and are only used amongst the faculty PERIOD The only sources students can use are online PERIOD Half the reviews on Rate My Professor are intangible and hardly useful while some websites like MyEDU and Koofers offer grade breakdowns for every professor PERIOD While this is helpful some classes may only be taught by one professor who either doesnt grade fairly or slacks with teaching PERIOD The options are limited PERIOD

The committee which surveyed students for insight on the new SOIS is still gathering its findings PERIOD The report is not university endorsed yet so the new survey may not be complete in the immediate future PERIOD We hope that the university chooses to positively change an outdated system PERIOD
