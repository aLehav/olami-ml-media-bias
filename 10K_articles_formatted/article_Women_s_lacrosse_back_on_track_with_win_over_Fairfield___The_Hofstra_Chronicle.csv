After four consecutive losses and a slide in the national rankings the Hofstra University womens lacrosse team returned to winning ways with a  victory over Fairfield PERIOD

 said head coach Abby Morgan PERIOD 

It was not the ideal start for Hofstra as Fairfield scored two goals in the games first  PERIOD

The Pride  began controlling draws seeming to settle down the offense and control possession for a bit PERIOD

Hofstra rallied back from a  deficit scoring the last seven goals of the half capped by freshman attacker Lindsay McKinnons third goal of the game PERIOD

Along with McKinnons three sophomore attacker Claire Brady added two of her own PERIOD Junior goalie Jackie Pandolf was busy in the first half making five saves PERIOD

 said Pandolf PERIOD 

Hofstra experienced a scary moment when Brady was pushed from behind and fell awkwardly on her leg and was taken out of the game PERIOD

The offensive attack did not slow down though as some great distribution picked apart the Fairfield defense PERIOD

 said Morgan PERIOD



Fairfield tried to scrap its way back into the game but Hofstras offense proved to be too much as junior midfielder Maryann Miller and freshman attacker Jenn Ward tacked on goals PERIOD

There was a lull in scoring as both teams could not find the net for almost  minutes but the streak was broken when Ward tallied her second of the game to put Hofstra up  with  remaining in the game PERIOD

The Stags did not pose much of an offensive threat throughout the second half as Hofstra continued to control possession for a majority of the last  minutes PERIOD

Hofstra was able to put an exclamation point on its win scoring its highest number of goals in a game this season

 said Pandolf PERIOD
