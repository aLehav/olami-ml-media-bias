The neverending grind of playing  games over the course of  weeks takes a toll on the body PERIOD

So is the case for the Penn State mens soccer team the No PERIOD  seed in the NCAA tournament and the Big Ten tournament runnerup PERIOD

That conference tournament held last weekend at Jeffrey Field in which the Lions played three games in four days did a number on the team physically PERIOD

Obviously Im a little tired senior Andy Parr said PERIOD I think thered be something wrong with me if I wasnt a little tired right now. though Parr and the Nittany Lions fell to Michigan  in the Big Ten championship game their  record this season earned them a firstround bye and a home game in the NCAA tournament PERIOD

The Lions would have had to play this Thursday had they not earned one of the tournaments top16 seeds PERIOD

Instead Penn State will play the winner of Virginia and Old Dominion at  p.m PERIOD Sunday and the players couldnt be more grateful to have this week off from competition PERIOD

At this point in the year were all in shape we all know the system were playing in cocaptain Drew Cost said PERIOD

We just need to have our legs under us and be able to come out with a lot of energy and intensity at home. all year coach Bob Warming has been stressing to his players the importance of resting up and taking care of their bodies in the days off from games PERIOD

Warming encourages his team to always keep its fluid intake up eat well and to make the most of the knowledge the training staff has to offer PERIOD

Its everything Warming said of recovering properly PERIOD The good news is the guys have practiced it a lot PERIOD Its not like all of sudden were saying OK make sure you get rest now. the guys have done a good job of taking care of themselves. one of the results of taking such good care of themselves throughout the season is that the Lions have very few injuries on the team PERIOD

Warming said his players have also been smart enough to avoid potentially dangerous tackles and situations on the field PERIOD

One player who has been battling injuries this season is Cost PERIOD

Having suffered an injury to his left foot before the Lions game against Michigan State on Oct PERIOD  Cost can still feel occasional pain and reaggravated the injury against Indiana on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

With ample time off this week Cost will do the best he can to let his foot heal PERIOD

However he also knows the season is on the line and injuries can wait until the offseason PERIOD

Its getting better and doesnt really hurt all that much anymore Cost said PERIOD
