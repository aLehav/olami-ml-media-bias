Among the campaign sponsors is Woodstocks Pizza which Lombardo said was particularly active in helping to promote the drive PERIOD Woodstocks Director of Business Development John Francis said that when he and the owners of Woodstocks learned about the fundraiser they were impressed with the high level of participation by UCSB staff and faculty PERIOD

When Pam Lombardo told us that nine percent of faculty were giving money from their paychecks for this cause we asked if we could do more to help too Francis said PERIOD One of the weaknesses of the event is that faculty is participating and not really the students and they may not even know about it. to raise money and increase student involvement with the United Way drive Woodstocks will host a fundraiser kickoff party on Tuesday Jan PERIOD  from  to  p.m. during which time it will donate  percent of sales to the charity PERIOD Additionally every Thursday during the event  of every  purchase from its Arbor location on campus will go toward the charity PERIOD

In addition to coordinating with local businesses United Way volunteers were working closely with the Office of Student Life to educate staff and students about volunteer and charity programs within the Santa Barbara community PERIOD OSL Assistant Director of Firstyear Programs and Leadership Education Miles Ashlock said he has served as a liaison between United Way campaign coordinators and the various departments of student life PERIOD

Ashlock said that in addition to driving faculty participation within departments he was working to educate people on campus about the various programs United Way supports in the community PERIOD

One of the most salient things that attracts donators on campus is United Ways strong connection with the Isla Vista Youth Foundation whose programs hit home for a lot of faculty and staff Ashlock said PERIOD
