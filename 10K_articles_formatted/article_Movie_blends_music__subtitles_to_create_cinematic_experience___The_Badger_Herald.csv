2804,2009-10-15,"foreign films are not for everyone PERIOD Most people dont scan the selection at Four Star Video Heaven for the most obscure titles around excited by the prospect of reading subtitles for two hours PERIOD And just like the foreign genre musicals have their own unique audience as well mostly made up of those who grew up reciting lines from The Sound of Music or possibly Labyrinth. if you happen to enjoy both the foreign and musical genres a film such as Paris  is exactly what you have been dreaming of PERIOD

Originally titled Faubourg  Paris  opened internationally in Belgium in  and just debuted at the Sundance Theater in Hilldale Mall PERIOD The musical drama is directed and written by Christophe Barratier creator of The Chorus. the film begins with the protagonist Pigoil Grard Jugnot The Red Inn being questioned during the investigation of a murder PERIOD The film then flashes back to New Years of  in a small workingclass town north of Paris known simply as the Faubourg PERIOD When the clock strikes midnight the local music hall the Chansonia is shut down PERIOD This marks the beginning of an unfortunate year for Pigoil and his fellow workers who face unemployment PERIOD The loss is especially tough for Pigoil who without a steady paycheck is forced to give up custody of his young son JoJo Maxence Perrin The Red Notebook PERIOD

The rest of the film follows the attempts of Pigoil and residents of Faubourg to occupy the Chansonia and create the musical they have always dreamed of PERIOD While things start off a bit rocky the mysterious appearance of a beautiful and talented singer named Douce Nora Arnezeder Two Worlds gives the amateur venue hope PERIOD They face many obstacles along the way specifically with Galpiat BernardPierre Donnadieu TVs How Much We Hated Each Other a gangsterlike villain who controls the Faubourg PERIOD

While the community works together the country is separated by political unrest PERIOD A recent election of the Popular Front gives hope to the working class but also creates extremist groups PERIOD Pigoils old friend and coworker Milou Clovis Cornillac Cah is a spokesperson for the working people and is determined to change the world through his political philosophy PERIOD

While the plot and structure of Paris  is not unique by any means it follows a structure similar to Moulin Rouge minus the pop references it is an exceptional work of foreign cinema that charms audience members with earnest characters and delightful songs PERIOD Jugnot who has worked with Barratier before on The Chorus portrays the character of Pigoil empathetically PERIOD Arnezeders Douce at times stares off vapidly but has a captivating voice and endearing look that is captivating all the same PERIOD There are no cheesy musical theater numbers and the characters are genuine PERIOD

One of the most pleasing aspects of this film has to be the beautiful scenery PERIOD Paris in the winter the countryside drive and the brightly lit stage of the Chansonia all engage the viewer creating a nostalgic longing for a time when men wore tweed caps and families dressed up to attend the theater PERIOD All of the music and colorful schemes make for one pretty film PERIOD

While much of Paris  charms the audience one of the main problems is its tendency to jump genres unpredictably PERIOD The film is like a confused teenager experiencing an identity crisis trying to belong to every genre PERIOD Is it a political drama Just a drama A musical comedy A romantic period piece Although the variety keeps the viewer engaged it can be overwhelming to have five subplots poorly intertwined PERIOD

A lighthearted film Paris  tells the triumph of the small town and artistic ambition in an effective enjoyable way PERIOD It has charm that resonates with audiences young and old who appreciate the music and style of the 30s PERIOD If you are looking for a delightful pickmeup on one of these dreary cool fall days Paris  is a promising destination PERIOD

 stars out of  PERIOD
