2420,2023-10-26,"relocating most of your possessions into a halfclosetsized room this fall can seem like a daunting task but new students dont have to do it alone PERIOD Smiling upperclassmen donned in bright orange will be waiting to greet you direct you to the right place and even help you lug up your boxes to your new home PERIOD Yes Class of  thank your Illini Guides the returning residents who volunteer to make your movein day that much easier PERIOD

However theres plenty of advice to make the moving process easier on the new students end PERIOD The first would be how many people to bring along for the job PERIOD

University Housing recommends bringing at least one family member or friend to watch the car but students are welcome to bring along more PERIOD While its easy to think the more the merrier in this situation there is a point when too many people can slow down the move said Tori Baier IGuide in  and junior in Fine and Applied Arts PERIOD Baier recommends keeping it around two people the average number of assistants she saw as an IGuide PERIOD

Bringing four or more people is just too many people in the dorm room Baier said PERIOD You have to think about your roommate bringing family too and how many people can fit in a room. for those with a smaller support group theres no reason to worry PERIOD Whether a student is flying solo or is driven over by someone who cant assist the move the IGuides are always here to help PERIOD Extra planning can make a oneperson move easier as well PERIOD



I was lucky enough to have my father and younger brother act as the muscle for my moves until last spring when I had to take on the task myself PERIOD While each resident can rent a dolly to take the heave out of getting boxes from the car to the dorm I found that theres a lot of importance in how you organize PERIOD

Packing your belongings in midsized stackable bins and boxes can turn five dolly trips into two PERIOD Even more simply having less will make the process easier PERIOD It seems selfexplanatory but it may be hard to part with everything nonessential PERIOD Many students cant seem to say goodbye to half of their wardrobe hobby collection or library of books PERIOD However remember most dorm rooms are small enough to begin with and youre only entitled to half if youre living in a double PERIOD Cluttering the space you have can make it seem even smaller PERIOD

Whether its grabbing a couple of IGuides for help or downloading the new Movein Day App new residents are provided several resources to make the first day on campus more enjoyable PERIOD Taking advantage of them can ensure a successful movein no matter if you have mom and dad helping you or youre settling in yourself PERIOD
