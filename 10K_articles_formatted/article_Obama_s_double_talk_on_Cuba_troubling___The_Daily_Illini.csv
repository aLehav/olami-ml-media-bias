Never in the lives of two generations of Cubans have the people of Cuba known democracy PERIOD This is the terrible and tragic status quo that we have known for half a century  of elections that are anything but free or fair of dissidents locked away in dark prison cells for the crime of speaking the truth PERIOD I wont stand for this injustice you wont stand for this injustice and together we will stand up for freedom in Cuba PERIOD That will be my commitment as president of the United States of America. these words spoken by senator and presidential candidate Barack Obama to the Cuban American National Foundation last week are an indictment of oppressive governmental power PERIOD

Though he claims to be on the side of justice the candidate pledged in the same speech to keep the present U.S PERIOD embargo on Cuba which DemocracyNow.org called a threat to win Cuban reforms. the embargo on Cuba is a policy that was put into place at the height of the Cold War when fears of Soviet missiles and communist penetration were at their peak and has been maintained even though the threat that prompted it has collapsed according to CubaHeadlines.com PERIOD

Obama said he would open the doors of diplomacy between Cuba and the U.S. a motion that candidates Hillary Clinton and John McCain have refused to make according to Fox News PERIOD This somewhat validates his campaign slogan of change PERIOD However while increasing diplomacy would be a step forward it is not enough to simply hold conversations with the leaders of other nations without taking away the pressure of power PERIOD



Meetings and negotiations mean nothing when one party has a proverbial gun to its head and everything to lose while the other is comfortable in its seat of power and dominance PERIOD

Removing the embargo would send a clear signal that the U.S PERIOD is ready for real negotiation and respects the Cuban people enough to stop denying them normal trade travel and diplomatic relations PERIOD

It is unfair that Cubans suffer because of U.S PERIOD leaders relations with the countrys former president Fidel Castro PERIOD

According to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine the U.S PERIOD embargo is largely to blame for a shortage of medical supplies and many public health disasters in Cuba including a blindness epidemic caused by scarce access to nutrients GuillainBarre outbreaks stemming from a lack of chlorination and an epidemic of lye ingestion among toddlers caused by a shortage of soap PERIOD

Economic development has also been hampered because the embargo denies the Cuban market access to medicines tourism food and various goods that are helpful or necessary in the development of a nation PERIOD

But the U.S PERIOD embargo not only affects the availability of goods it affects the spread of information PERIOD U.S PERIOD researchers are restricted from traveling to the island and books CDs and software are not allowed to be sent to fill the requests made by libraries and researchers PERIOD The quest for information and scientific inquiry should be encouraged not inhibited PERIOD

These policies are in direct conflict with the values of freedom democracy and humanity that Americans are supposed to hold so dear PERIOD

If the leaders of this country really care about helping the Cuban people they should lift the embargo as well as other restrictions and send humanitarian aid medical supplies food and other necessary services directly to the Cuban people PERIOD They should work with the Cuban government which has shown a changing attitude toward freedom of speech and economic policy since the transition of power into the hands of Castros brother Raul PERIOD

Communication is key in the game of world politics PERIOD However communication cannot properly take place in an environment of dominance and force  an idea that none of the three wellfunded contenders in the race for the Oval Office seem to understand PERIOD",Obama's double-talk on Cuba troubling - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
