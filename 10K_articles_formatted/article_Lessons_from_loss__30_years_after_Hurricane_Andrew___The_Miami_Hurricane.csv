For the first three weeks after Hurricane Andrew there was no electricity in MiamiDade County MDC PERIOD In the northern part of the county buildings remained mostly intact but trees laid across roads and yards blocking emergency vehicles repair services and pedestrians PERIOD

In the southern part some houses only retained a single wall PERIOD Others completely blew away PERIOD At the time it was the most expensive hurricane in US history totaling  billion United States Dollars USD in damages  billion USD in todays dollars PERIOD

August twenty-fourth marks the thirtieth anniversary of the category five hurricane whose eye blew through the south of MDC before continuing West PERIOD The storm touched all of MDC including the University of Miami PERIOD

Sylvia Thompson a political science professor at UM describes it as the best of times and the worst of times. she remembers her elderly neighbors in South Miami acting as crossing guards when the stoplights didnt work due to power outages PERIOD Neighbors would fetch water for them PERIOD

Where Thompson lived closer to the university there was minimal property damage but many of the areas iconic centuriesold trees lay on the ground PERIOD

You could actually drive through areas where you would think where am I because a lot of the landmarks were gone Thompson said referring to the fallen trees PERIOD

She never expected the violent nature of the storm PERIOD The last category four hurricane to hit Miami occurred  years ago in  PERIOD The last category five was nearly  years ago PERIOD

We were lulled into a sense of feeling safe Thompson said PERIOD

At UM too students and faculty didnt expect the storms violence PERIOD While some evacuated thousands of students and faculty sheltered in Stanford Mahoney Pearson Eaton and Hecht residential colleges PERIOD

I dont think we had any indication even five days out that it could hit us in the way that it did said Patricia Whitely senior vice president for student affairs who was the associate director for residential life and staff development at the time PERIOD

Andrew blew through the campus at  mph beginning around midnight of the twenty-fourth and finishing at  a.m the same day PERIOD

Marc Caputo a  graduate of UM was among the students sheltering PERIOD The university moved him and other students to the third and fourth floors of the now demolished Hecht Residential College PERIOD

The storm was really howling Caputo said PERIOD You could feel the building move. caputo and his fellow residents finally emerged from the building the following day PERIOD

It was just a different world at that point Caputo said PERIOD

The university sustained . million USD of damage mostly to its trees many of which the storm blew down PERIOD

With little electricity concerns about running water and limited food available the university encouraged students to fly home by discounting the cost of Delta American and United flights from the following semesters tuition PERIOD

In the aftermath of the storm the school closed from August twenty-eighth to September fourteenth delaying the start of classes by three weeks and changing finals schedules so that students took exams in class instead of during finals week PERIOD

Even once students returned the remnants of Hurricane Andrew lingered PERIOD

On the way to class Caputo would hear parrots squawking in the trees by the Ashe building escapees of Parrot Jungle which Hurricane Andrew destroyed PERIOD He estimates that the university had returned to normalcy a year later PERIOD

Whitely and Thompson lauded then university president Tad Footes response PERIOD

He did an amazing amazing job and he should be credited for really getting this place back Whitely said PERIOD

Whitely recounted daily morning meetings between Foote and the faculty at the law school library as the university got back on its feet PERIOD

In the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew the university realized it needed to plan for future hurricanes to avoid the kind of chaos that occurred in the subsequent weeks PERIOD

Now hurricane awareness is a key part of students introduction to the university and there is a set action plan in place in the event of another hurricane PERIOD This includes mandatory evacuation procedures if the hurricane exceeds a category two and an established university shelter for students who may be unable to return home PERIOD

The university also maintains the Office of Emergency Management PERIOD Created in  the office helps prepare the university for a myriad of disasters hurricanes being among the most pertinent PERIOD

The biggest impact that it had on not only the county but the university and individuals like me is we take hurricanes seriously Thompson said PERIOD Pre Andrew it seemed to me nobody paid any attention to what was happening during hurricane season. in the southern part of the county the scene was radically different PERIOD

Thompson remembers hearing of looting in Homestead the more heavily damaged southern part of the county PERIOD Blocked roads aggravated the issue creating a temporary feeling of anarchy as public services could not reach the area PERIOD

Arthur Simon a political science professor at UM recalls Country Walk a community close to the Everglades and south of the university PERIOD He used to campaign at a mobilehome park there during his time as a state legislator going door to door seeking out votes PERIOD

He returned after Hurricane Andrew to find that it was gone PERIOD

 units completely wiped off of Gods green Earth Simon said PERIOD We went to physically where it was and it was gone. in the week following Hurricane Andrew Simon received the opportunity to survey the damage to MiamiDade county in a helicopter tour alongside four CEOs of the top insurance companies in the country PERIOD

Seeing mile after mile after mile community after community after community of damage PERIOD It was just overwhelming Simon said PERIOD

The hurricane destroyed  MiamiDade homes leaving  homeless PERIOD Of those who lost their homes or needed support  were UM faculty and staff PERIOD

When you see these news clips where a tornado hits or even a hurricane hits it shows you how bad it is PERIOD But usually its just a snapshot of a limited area Simon said PERIOD Here theres complete devastation going over almost a half of the county. shoddy building practices accentuated the disparity in the county PERIOD Buildings near Homestead were much newer making them more vulnerable to the force of Hurricane Andrew PERIOD In the following years legislators updated building codes to be much stricter PERIOD

Insurance discounts incentivized residents to retrofit their homes with hurricane windows and incorporate other structural support PERIOD

A burmese python breeding facility near the Everglades was among the affected buildings PERIOD With walls blown to the ground nonnative pythons escaped into the Everglades initiating a now decadesold threat to the biodiversity of South Florida PERIOD

Top predators and evasive Burmese pythons are prolific and difficult to eradicate PERIOD Theyve reduced the mammal population of the Everglades by  preying on marsh rabbits bobcats deer and even panthers who were once near extinction PERIOD

The mammals that are being lost were an important part of the food web of the Everglades for thousands of years said Christopher Searcy a biology professor at UM with expertise in conservation ecology for reptiles and amphibians PERIOD Weve disrupted that and its not clear that were ever going to be able to fix it. by reducing the import of foreign species as pets Searcy says South Florida can prevent another similar ecological disaster PERIOD

Since the future of hurricanes is so unpredictable the best residents can do is prepare PERIOD According to the Office of Emergency Management students and other residents can develop a family emergency plan build a kit of essentials and stay informed on potential hurricanes PERIOD

The Miami Hurricane is the student newspaper of the University of Miami in Coral Gables Florida PERIOD The newspaper is edited and produced by undergraduate students at UM and is published in print every Tuesday and online everyday during the academic year PERIOD",Lessons from loss: 30 years after Hurricane Andrew - The Miami Hurricane,University of Miami
