My fellow Wolverines

As an elected representative of the Central Student Government and as a member of Greek life I owe each and every member of the University community an apology PERIOD Over the weekend of January  my fraternity and I went on a ski trip PERIOD On that ski trip some members caused extensive damage to the host resort PERIOD While my fraternity is making full restitution to the owner the destruction was appalling and inexcusable and I condemn it in the harshest terms PERIOD I am even more saddened by the damage that my fellow students caused to the reputation of the University PERIOD It pains me to know that members of my own fraternity were able to tarnish the good name of our fraternity Michigan Greek life and the entire University PERIOD

Let me say in the clearest terms  I did not commit any damage to the resort nor did I witness any destruction as it was taking place PERIOD When I discovered what had happened I was horrified and deeply ashamed of the behavior of my peers PERIOD I immediately began working with other members of my fraternity to mitigate and control the situation to prevent further destruction PERIOD

As a leader on this campus I am accountable to each of you PERIOD Leaders do not run away from problems they confront them and work toward solutions PERIOD Since that weekend I have helped lead my fraternity brothers in an attempt to right the wrongs that were committed PERIOD I organized four build sites through Habitat for Humanity that will be dedicated shortly PERIOD In order to begin mending the ties with our neighboring communities I planned a chapter service trip to Detroit with the help of The Detroit Partnership PERIOD I am a strong believer in the principle of restorative justice and the fraternity is working to repair relations with our neighbors PERIOD

I refuse to be defined by the actions of others PERIOD My record speaks for itself PERIOD I have dedicated my time on campus to positive worthwhile causes and have worked to impact meaningful change PERIOD While serving on the boards of SRC and GARP I devoted time to maintaining Greek selfgovernance safety and responsibility PERIOD As an LSA representative on Central Student Government I have pursued change within the dining department planned events such as the Police Brutality Speakout and worked to increase diversity on campus by serving on CSGs OnSite Admissions Task Force PERIOD I have met with administrators to discuss problems on campus and I have worked with administrators to create solutions to these problems PERIOD Most recently I worked with the Dining Department to design a program that will allow students to donate their leftover Dining Dollars and Blue Bucks at the end of the year to local food pantries PERIOD Beginning at the end of March all students will be able to donate money in  increments at all campus stores like UGos Victors and the Blue Apple PERIOD The money that is raised will be used to purchase local sustainable nonperishable food that will be donated to local food pantries including our campus own student food pantry PERIOD As a student leader I have worked to represent the interests of fellow students and to build a better campus for all communities PERIOD

As a candidate for CSG vice president with The Team I plan to continue and expand upon this important work PERIOD I want to ensure that as the voice of the students our CSG is representative of all communities on campus not just those of a few PERIOD Its time for all students to have easy convenient access to their elected representatives so that CSG gives students a chance to share their ideas and accomplish their goals PERIOD CSG has tremendous potential to be a driver of collaboration with and empowerment of student leaders not of competition and politics PERIOD Student leaders should be able to rely on CSGs budget administration connections and clout as a platform to advance their great work on campus PERIOD Together we can support and empower student leaders across campus to better address important issues such as increased minority enrollment increased sexual assault awareness and prevention efforts and an improved campus climate PERIOD By working together our collective potential is much greater than that of any individual PERIOD

I ask you to judge me based on my accomplishments and my ideas rather than on the actions of some members of my fraternity PERIOD I am not my fraternity PERIOD I am Matt Fidel PERIOD I am running for Vice President because I see the great potential of CSG and I want to continue serving you PERIOD I am a member of The Team and together we can focus on the real opportunities and challenges that lie ahead PERIOD With your input and support we can partner to accomplish our shared goals PERIOD We have serious work to do and I look forward to getting started PERIOD

Feel free to email me at mhfidelumich.edu if you have any questions or ideas that you would like to discuss together PERIOD

Matt Fidel is an LSA sophomore PERIOD
