Dear Michelle

Im curious about bestiality PERIOD I heard it is common but is it risky Will I go to jail catch something or get an animal pregnant

More Than Your Typical Animal Lover

Dear MTYTYL

Bestiality is the sexual activity with an animal PERIOD Zoosexuality involves romantic and sexual desire for an animal PERIOD While both are considered a mental disorder the act of sex with an animal is illegal the desire is not PERIOD

While sexual activity with animals does occur it is not common PERIOD Data on bestiality is scarce and what has been reported is consistent with Alfred Kinseys study PERIOD Kinsey  found

Eight percent of men and four percent of women reported having has a sexual experience with animals at some point in their lives

For women the animals involved were most commonly dogs and cats and the sexual activities most often reported were general body contacts with the animals and cunnilingus performed by animals

Female intercourse with an animal was rarely reported

Eight percent of men brought themselves to orgasm with an animal

While you will not impregnate an animal it is not genetically possible and there is no data to suggest you will contract an STI you are at risk of worms fleas ticks salmonella campylobacteriosis scabies and other viruses PERIOD

If you are experiencing sexual attraction or participating in sexual activity with an animal speak to a professional about your sexual curiosity and desires PERIOD Sexual curiosity experimentation and acts should be healthy  mind body and spirit You can find options for sexual exploration that dont involve the family pet
