2784,2010-11-15,"carrotmob a nonprofit organization based out of San Francisco has been at work in communities across the nation for over two years now PERIOD The organization is built around the idea that realigning the rifts that divide everyday consumers businesses and community leaders can lead to the implementation of positive policies technology and business practices that everyone can benefit from PERIOD

Carrotmob has been surprisingly successful and received widespread recognition and support from Time The Economist and The New York Times PERIOD Since their humble beginnings in Northern California theyve spread across the nation and the globe seeping into Finland and France PERIOD A Carrotmob in San Francisco CA spent  at a local KD Market PERIOD Carrotmob is even in Madison where it is working with Ians Pizza to replace its electric water heater with a brand new  solarpowered water heater PERIOD

So what is the magic behind motivating private profitseeking entities to cut profit and be more socially responsible Buycotting PERIOD Carrotmob solicits bids from businesses in an area to find the business that would promise to spend the highest percentage of Carrotmob profits on implementing more environmentalfriendly business practices PERIOD Then the Carrotmob directs its positive buyingpower as consumers toward businesses who pledged the highest percentage of its profits PERIOD In this way Carrotmob is able to stimulate the adoption of positive business practices that benefit the community and the world PERIOD

Its consumer activism that focuses on the consumers positive power as opposed to their negative power PERIOD It rewards companies for being socially responsible rather than punishing them PERIOD Carrotmob capitalizes on the positive power in communities to have a positive impact on its environment and on its world PERIOD The group also highlights a communitys ability to fight the decay and apathy that affects so many Americans today PERIOD

The complacency epidemic can never be eradicated it is a stealthy side effect of success PERIOD But yielding to its inevitability is a sin nonetheless PERIOD Carrotmobs buycott of Ians Pizza increased profits by  percent and has created a genuine effort within the business itself to reduce its carbon footprint PERIOD Carrotmob also partnered with Madison Fresh Market and raised  to be donated to the Wisconsin Partners for Sustainability PERIOD While Carrotmob doesnt address our corporate cultures profit above all else mentality it helps communities fight indifference and detachment to the biggerthanlife issues that are affecting them today PERIOD

Carrotmobs efforts to make businesses more socially responsible are more than fundraising for a cause that is bigger than you your community or even your country PERIOD Its about substantiating the power of the people PERIOD When everyday citizens in a community can generate change that government or private corporations cannot or refuse to accommodate it speaks volumes about the will and character of those people PERIOD If we want to complain about the state of affairs that our community state country or even world is in we have an obligation and duty to participate in the efforts to make it better PERIOD

I think that we as a college community stand in a unique place and time in our lives and we forget that through organizations like Carrotmob we have the power to bypass the bureaucratic red tape in government and the corporate greed of private industry and enact the changes needed to create a better world PERIOD

We often forget that it is the complacency and lethargy that we indulge in that gives the government and multibillion dollar conglomerates power over us PERIOD We forget that their power is derived from us PERIOD Why not use that power to create a better world
