OSUs thirdannual Research Week continued Tuesday morning with a presentation about the Robotic Games project PERIOD



The project which is part of the OSU MultiAgent Robotics Hybrid and Embedded Systems Laboratory aims to encourage interest in engineering and science among children PERIOD



 said James McClintock presenter and Robotic Games team member PERIOD



The project is being designed to encourage interest in engineering and science in children ages  to ten years old because research shows undergraduate enrollment in engineering has been steadily dropping since the 1950s McClintock said PERIOD



The robot being used in the project is the Evolution Robotics Scorpion robot PERIOD These robots are leading the field in robotics technology Brent Perteet presenter and Robotic Games team member said PERIOD



The team developed four games in which children will be able to interact with the robots PERIOD Scavenger Hunt in which a person uses a remote control to direct the robot to locate several objects that the robot has programmed in its memory is the main game used in demonstrations PERIOD



They will be primarily using this game to maximize the childrens interactions with the robots McClintock said PERIOD



In October the Robotic Games team invited a group of  Cub Scouts and their parents to come and help test the hybrid robotic games PERIOD



 Perteet said PERIOD 



The other games the team developed are Hide and Seek Marco Polo and Search and Rescue Mission PERIOD



The idea of the Robotic Games project is to go to elementary schools and give demonstrations to the children allow them to play the robotic games and inform them about careers in the field of science and engineering and talk about why its an interesting and fun field of study and work the team said PERIOD



 McClintock said PERIOD 



The demonstrations can be done in classrooms since the only materials required are laptop computers the robots and a wireless router PERIOD



The team is working on the development of a PDA what does this mean interface which would allow the person playing the game to control the robot through a PDA PERIOD



Future work for the Robotic Games team includes developing a new game planning afternoon workshops for children from nearby schools and developing ageappropriate literature on robotics to accompany the demonstrations PERIOD



 Perteet said PERIOD
