Oscar Cisneros a junior studying agricultural business is running for president in the  Associated Students general election PERIOD

Cisneros who grew up in Watsonville California chose Chico State for its College of Agriculture PERIOD

I had heard about the people and the resources and opportunities it offered and I was also ready for a change of scenery and Northern California seemed like the place to go Cisneros said PERIOD

Cisneros has been involved in campus organizations including Men of Chico a program at the CrossCultural Leadership Center which empowers men of color on campus and The League a mentorship program to local high school students PERIOD

He is also employed at the Student Transition And Retention Center or STAR Center where he has worked to help students make connections on campus and form plans for what they will do after graduating PERIOD

He has experience organizing campuswide events including last years Dia de los Muertos event PERIOD

Cisneros plans to work on three main issues should he serve as president in the upcoming year campus safety transparency and greater representation PERIOD

I plan to work to create more student events that are representative of the student body PERIOD We are a Hispanic serving institution so we should have events that are representative of those students and ensure everyone on campus feels welcomed Cisneros said PERIOD

Cisneros has been involved in leadership since high school where he was part of the associated student body PERIOD He believes in the importance of campus leadership being accessible and responsive to students PERIOD

I think the AS President should be actively involved in the campus but also be accessible to students when they want to voice frustrations and concerns Cisneros said PERIOD For that reason I want to invite student orgs to give AS feedback on how we can help to ensure their survival as we struggle with a declining enrollment and retention rate. through his experience at Chico State Cisneros values what he has learned about pressing on through setbacks PERIOD

It takes a lot for us to stay on top of our classes work have a social life and have time for ourselves so inevitably we may stretch ourselves thin and we may fail or not do the best we could PERIOD At the end of the day if we are able to try again and make our best effort I think that says a lot about a person. oscar Cisneros is promoting his campaign on Instagram at oscarforaspresident PERIOD

Oscar Cisneros will be running against Autumn AlanizWiggins and JJ Arciga PERIOD

Voting will begin on April  at  a.m. and will end at  a.m PERIOD on April  PERIOD
