This is again completely fictional PERIOD

I do not consider myself a prude but UNA calm down please My virginal eyes cannot take any more of your sexual innuendo on campus PERIOD I thought moving to Florence from Seattle to attend school would mean I would be leaving the sexually progressive and liberated. was I wrong PERIOD Today the average student at UNA is inundated with all kind of innuendos and crass displays pawned off as art

While on my daily jog around Florence last week I was joined unintentionally by two new running partners PERIOD These gents while in their late 60s do not stop running and wear the shortest of shorts with fragmented pieces of fabric they call shirts to cover their nips PERIOD

While on the run I couldnt help but stare at our campus Shakespearean statues PERIOD Jeez Juliet put a sweater on PERIOD What are you trying to do cut glass Do not even get me started on Romeo and the butt floss he calls tights PERIOD

Post jog I felt a bit short of breath PERIOD It could have been a cold or the  miles my running partners insisted on PERIOD Regardless I needed some professional medical assistance PERIOD After my scoot on my Razor scooter over to the infirmary I soon regretted my visit PERIOD What with all the intrusive questions on my s.e.x. life I needed an inhaler to calm myself down PERIOD To cap off this uncomfortable visit I was not amused by the Brown Bag Special at the exit PERIOD There is nothing fun about that Lifestyle

I had had enough of this days dirty images PERIOD This onslaught of uncomfortable and personal questions needed to come to an end PERIOD I needed to unwind PERIOD

Arguably one of the most beautiful and tranquil activities on campus is to enjoy our proud mascots frolicking amongst their habitat PERIOD

Watching these animals untouched by the dirtiness and perversions of the outside world is humbling PERIOD Nothing is more majestic than watching as Leo playfully rubs his mane against Una and shows affection to his  Oh Come on Leo thats your sister Someone grab a hose theyre at it again PERIOD
