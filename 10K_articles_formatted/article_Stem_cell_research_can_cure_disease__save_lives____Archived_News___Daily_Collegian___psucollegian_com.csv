According to President George W PERIOD Bush the stem cell research bill which Bush vetoed on July  would 

Point taken PERIOD I just need to ask two questions PERIOD Why is  stem cells which have no proven brain function or EEG electroencephalogram pattern and nothing to  for crossing a moral boundary It seems to the president that it is not crossing a moral boundary to kill no quotes were definitely killing in this case innocent civilian Iraqis in the hope of benefiting the greater population of Iraq and the U.S PERIOD

According to leading scientists in the field our society has defined death as the loss of the cerebral EEG pattern PERIOD Some scientists have also thought that the acquisition of the human EEG which occurs at about  weeks of life should be defined as when a human life begins PERIOD This view has been put forth most concretely by scientists Morowitz and Trefil  PERIOD

Whether youre religious or not one cannot accept science in one case EEG loss at death yet simply ignore science in another EEG acquisition during cell development PERIOD

I just dont understand why there is even a debate over whether stem cell research should be funded by our government and our society PERIOD It is nothing more than a case of hypocrisy in that Mr PERIOD Bush is saying that killing to help others is wrong while he has thousands of our troops in Iraq killing civilian Iraqis to eventually help others PERIOD

Now before I go on please note that my opinion does not make me unpatriotic or unsupportive of the troops PERIOD Youd be wrong if you assumed so PERIOD Just keep reading and please lets concentrate on the issue at hand PERIOD

How is it perfectly acceptable to take the lives of living loving families in Iraq and around the world yet killing something thats not even alive in medical terms in hopes of finding medical cures is seen as wrong and immoral Is there some loophole in the rules for killing Does the president know something that we dont

Of course you cant kill something thats not alive so what is the problem with stem cell research Some of you reading this have known the pain and suffering of losing a loved one from diseases which stem cell research could possibly end PERIOD Just to name a few they include ALS Lou Gehrigs disease Alzheimers autism cancer cystic fibrosis diabetes heart disease HIVAIDS lupus multiple sclerosis Parkinsons disease and pulmonary fibrosis PERIOD There are also about  more PERIOD

Since I mentioned some of the many diseases stem cell research could help cure Id like to put a bit of a face to what Ive been saying PERIOD After all the president held an embryo adoption program baby  uh I mean stem cell right prez  during the veto ceremony on July  PERIOD

Autumn Jadwin Class of  has witnessed the lack of stem cell research firsthand PERIOD Her father was diagnosed with three yes three brain tumors PERIOD Doctors did all they could but were unable to save this once powerful man PERIOD For over two and a half agonizing years this man withered away PERIOD During his final seven months he was unable to even ask his family for a cookie after dinner one night PERIOD This man this husband this father died at the age of  with everything to live for PERIOD

If you think that Im just an advocate for stem cell research because its the latest news in the media think again PERIOD As I mentioned I come from a strong military heritage and as far back as I could remember I wanted to serve my country PERIOD I was rejected twice by the military for medical reasons  reasons which could have been prevented by stem cell research PERIOD

In the end Im not trying to say that everyone must abandon their God and help support stem cell research PERIOD

All I am saying is that if we are truly going to help people in this world of ours we must explore every medical path science allows and we can start with stem cell research PERIOD
