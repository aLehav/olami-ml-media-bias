New sisters walk to the Tate Bus Stop in order to ride buses to their sorority houses on Milledge Ave PERIOD in Athens Ga PERIOD on Monday August   Photo Jonah Allen jonahallenphotogmail.com PERIOD

When going through recruitment you decide the next four years of your life for your sorority or your college football team PERIOD It begins with you the hopeful college football player or the potential new sorority member PERIOD

Next a second party jumps into the mix the football coaches at the universities and the recruitment chairs at each Greek organization PERIOD Different titles contrasting platforms same job to recruit PERIOD

Then both the recruiters and the recruits themselves need some backup to help with decisions and communication PERIOD Enter the high school coaches or Gamma Chis the neutral third party to smooth the process PERIOD

So how do they find you How do these organizations know youre the one for them Sororities they use Facebook like the great aunt who likes every one of your pictures searching through old profile pictures to remember your face your interests and your friends PERIOD And football teams are no different they just use recruiting sites such as .com to keep up on your statistics and your rankings PERIOD

And based on your rank there are favorites PERIOD Sororities have top girls and football teams have fivestars PERIOD To decide schools and recruits and sororities and possible new members trim their lists PERIOD Whos the best fit What other options are in the picture What can they bring to the program

And as the questions are answered lists are shaved and top picks are chosen PERIOD And its not merely the people directly involved with the decision PERIOD Outside parties take it upon themselves to determine the best PERIOD Writers and networks across the country or Greek online websites decide who is the best team on a national scale while every girl going through rush does the same on a personal level PERIOD The football rankings are based on wins execution and production and for the potential members sorority rankings are based on the most winning welcome the best executed cheers and the quality of conversation production PERIOD Social calendar is synonymous with playing time PERIOD Dues correlate with scholarships PERIOD And merchandise represents Nike sponsorships PERIOD

To woo you they bring out all the stops PERIOD The fancy food the elaborate decorations and the memorable stories  its all part of the appeal PERIOD If youre at Sigma Kappa they might even show you the indoor gym or in football the indoor practice facility available to you for every workout and practice PERIOD They show off their renovations like Texas AMs Kyle Field or Tri Deltas house PERIOD Two facilities sure but one purpose to have and to hold the potential recruits for four years of college PERIOD

Every addition to a football team doesnt come from a high school cafeteria  there are some who have embraced the collegiate atmosphere at other schools joining Georgia as college football veterans from other schools like junior colleges PERIOD Sophomores go through sorority recruitment as well meeting quotas for the amount of upper classmen PERIOD

But during the recruitment the system can unhinge and the process can falter PERIOD Coaches are not allowed to call the player until Sept PERIOD  of a recruits junior year and there are only five official visits permitted senior year PERIOD Sororities and potential members cannot contact each other through the entirety of formal recruitment and every visit before must be documented to Panhellenic PERIOD If rules are broken punishments ensue including loss of socials and NCAA violations PERIOD Each group must play by the rules PERIOD

Through the process some take you back others hang you out to dry PERIOD Each party actively decides who will stay throughout the entirety of the recruitment PERIOD And sometimes scholarships are pulled and potential members are dropped PERIOD

Recruitment is over and you move on past what could have been moped scooters Silver Dollar extra large Tshirts and Milledge Avenue PERIOD

But if you make it far enough things get serious and things get even more real than the engagement to the girl who lists her profession as a free spirit on national television PERIOD Its preferential round or as they say in college football the official visit PERIOD Sororities get on one knee and share with you their real intentions behind the aggressive screaming for the past few days and universities decide if they will offer you a spot on their team PERIOD

Now its up to you to accept PERIOD You weigh your options and size up the pros and cons of the football team or the sorority PERIOD Sign the letter of intent or the bid day card depending on which route youre choosing to journey down athletics or athleisure outfits PERIOD

The others involved find out your decision on signing day or bid day PERIOD Its a cause for celebration as all of your closest friends watch you sign your name to the school you will grace with your athleticism for the next four years PERIOD Its a night of jubilation as all the girls who will become your closest friends share with you the lawn that will become home to you in your next four years of adventures PERIOD

Four years from one decision and one process PERIOD Football or Greek life its recruitment PERIOD Break it down into a simple science and its a developed method across the board PERIOD

So listen up PERIOD football recruits and potential new members high school coaches and Gamma Chis college football coaches and recruitment chairs its time to exchange notes PERIOD
