As you read this Ahnold Schwarzenegger is enjoying his first day as governor PERIOD With the California deficit now estimated at  billion thats rightit starts with a B Arnold and Maria are keeping things lowkey but still very Republican PERIOD





About  people have been invited to attend the swearingin ceremony  not including the press PERIOD Once he becomes governor hell attend a luncheon with state and federal officials a familyonly reception and an invitationonly reception hosted by the California State Chamber of Commerce PERIOD





If youre an Arnold fan or voter and youre not an official family member or Chamber bigwig dont even bother trying to attend PERIOD Streets will be blocked off and the whole affair will be heavily guarded PERIOD





But after hes sworn in the television trucks will roll out of Sacramento and political coverage will finally focus decisively on the national elections  as they should PERIOD Not only are we deciding our next president were choosing who will select the next Supreme Court who will be our representatives in Congress and what issues we are going to tell them are most important to us PERIOD





Well at least some of us are PERIOD The  percent of us who vote will make a difference PERIOD





You think you know what Im going to say next dont you You think its going to be an tirade right





Wrong PERIOD There are some very good reasons not to vote PERIOD In fact I think the problem is that too many people vote  or at least too many people vote wrong PERIOD





I dont care what your stands on various issues are or who you think should be elected PERIOD As Americans we all have a right to make our own choices and vote accordingly PERIOD





But regardless of what the League of Women Voters posters say how you vote does matter PERIOD If you vote without knowing whats going on you just screw things up for all of us who do PERIOD





Voting isnt simply making a mark and making your voice heard PERIOD Its having something intelligent to say PERIOD



If you dont know whats going on in the world whats going on in Washington whats going on in your community you can make your voice heard but it will be the voice of irresponsibility PERIOD





If you dont know who your representatives are and how theyre voting or if you dont take time to read both sides of the story or if you dont go to the individual candidates Web sites and learn where they stand then your voting registration card should crumble into dust thats as worthless as your vote PERIOD





The frightening thing is as Ahnold proves people can be elected without taking a stand PERIOD What were his positions Nobody knew  but they voted for him just the same PERIOD





Maybe they liked his movies his wife his ragstoriches story or his Austrian accent PERIOD Maybe they thought it was a lark and wouldnt really win PERIOD





More likely they just didnt think PERIOD





With our national elections only a year away now is the time to become informed and involved PERIOD





Most candidates have student groups on campus PERIOD They all have Web sites official and unofficial PERIOD





Computer searches mean you can uncover what theyve done in the past what they are promising and who is endorsing them PERIOD





The primary election is less than three months away PERIOD Do you know anything about any candidate other than how they look and what party they belong to





Do you know what issues matter to you and how each of them stand on the issues If you dont please reconsider your decision to vote PERIOD





Voting with knowledge is the only responsible way to vote PERIOD It takes a little work but if youre not willing to put in ten minutes of newspaper time every day stay home PERIOD The world will be a better place if you do PERIOD
