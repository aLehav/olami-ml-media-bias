Taylor Swifts tenth studio album Midnights marks the artists glorious return to pop PERIOD

The album which Swift describes as the story of  sleepless nights scattered throughout her life is definitely one of her more vulnerable works but not her best and yet not her worst PERIOD

Swift takes listeners through thoughts and memories that kept her up at night PERIOD However it sounds like the memories in each track are not ones that haunt her but ones that she is processing and accepting PERIOD

Heres a rundown of the album and some of the tracks

The album starts off strong with Lavender Haze which I thought was the perfect opening track because it really sets the tone for the album especially with the first line being Meet me at midnight. the song is really about the feeling of falling in love and that love staying strong even through all the rumors about her relationship in the tabloids PERIOD

The albums lead single AntiHero is one of the tracks that showcases Swifts catchy and quirky pop sound that she does so well PERIOD Though the songs music video may seem a bit corny in ways it does touch on heavy topics and its lyrics dive straight into some of Swifts deepest and darkest insecurities PERIOD

As a devoted  apologist I was extremely excited when I heard the first line of Question was a sample from her  track Out Of The Woods. i think this Midnights track sounds like it could blend in among the other  tracks which is probably why I was drawn to it PERIOD However I was not a huge fan of the voice effects at the end of the bridge PERIOD

Karma has that addicting sound that Ive been chasing ever since her  era PERIOD She sings about how shes watching all the bad karma come right back around to those who wronged her while all her good karma is coming right back to her PERIOD The lyrics my pennies made your crown seem to be a jab at her former label manager Scooter Braun who owns the masters to her first six albums and therefore is the reason why she is rerecording those albums PERIOD

She continues singing about her good karma in the ridiculously endearing Sweet Nothing a romantic ballad that Swift cowrote with her boyfriend Joe Alwyn who goes by the pseudonym William Bowery in Swifts song credits PERIOD

Following the love ballad is Mastermind a song about how she crafted a plan to make her boyfriend fall in love with her PERIOD Its not as mischievous as it sounds though and the song is mostly her acknowledging and making fun of the fact that she did this PERIOD The song takes a turn during the bridge when she sings No one wanted to play with me as a little kid  So Ive been scheming like a criminal ever since  To make them love me and make it seem effortless. this gives the listener a bit of insight into why everything she does is so well thought out PERIOD

Jack Antonoff who Swift has worked with on numerous projects is listed as a cowriter and coproducer on Midnights. though I typically like what he produces I think Antonoffs use of voice effects and synth on this album seemed a bit redundant at times PERIOD

Producers can help the artist capture their own unique sound which Antonoff does and has done in the past with Swift and other artists PERIOD However Antonoff has his own sound too as a producer and I think that sound shines through at weird times throughout the album PERIOD Nonetheless the album has been a major success for Swift PERIOD

In less than  hours Midnights broke records across multiple streaming platforms such as Spotify Apple Music and Amazon Music PERIOD The album became the most streamed album in a day on Spotify with more than  million streams also making Swift the most streamed artist in a single day on the platform PERIOD Midnights is dominating the global charts and breaking records PERIOD

Swift announced there would be a chaotic surprise at  a.m PERIOD following the albums midnight release PERIOD Just hours later she released a deluxe version titled Midnights 3am Edition with seven additional tracks making it a sleepless night for fans PERIOD

While Midnights is great I think if you choose to listen to the album Midnights 3am Edition is the way to go PERIOD The seven additional tracks are worth it PERIOD
