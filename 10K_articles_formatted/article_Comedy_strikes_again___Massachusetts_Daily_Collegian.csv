NORTHAMPTON  Paula Poundstone has found the secret to making people laugh at their own flaws a talent she has perfected through several decades worth of jokes at her own expense PERIOD

With her omnipresent sarcasm and a spark of universal understanding in her eyes Poundstone could make a leopard laugh at its own spots PERIOD

Performing two sold out shows in one night at Iron Horse Music Hall Friday night it is clear that Poundstone has truly found success in the comedy business PERIOD

Neither frigid weather nor late hours could stop her dedicated fans from coming out to support her PERIOD A line of shivering Poundstone enthusiasts stretched far beyond the doors of the venue for the second show PERIOD

The comedienne swaggered to the stage in a longcoated pinstripe suit and dress shirt typical of her performance attire PERIOD

Upon calming the crowds enthusiastic reception Poundstone greeted her following by declaring them her most devoted of fans PERIOD

At the early show they were nice but you know they go to a  oclock show and some of them were dosing off PERIOD  It wasnt a mature crowd like this guy she said PERIOD

The unfortunate soul who chose to sit in the front row became the first topic of the evening PERIOD

Upon discovering that the gentleman in the front row was a selfproclaimed inventor Poundstone amused herself and the audience with an interrogative blend of comedy and a harsh dose of reality made comical by virtue of its truthfulness PERIOD

Youre an inventor  Really  And your mother is
