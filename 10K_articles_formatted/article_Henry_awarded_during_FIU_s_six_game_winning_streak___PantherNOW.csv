When it was brought up last week that FIU had won six consecutive games Mike Martinez the teams third baseman waved his hand as he shook his head PERIOD

Lets not jinx it though Martinez said PERIOD Lets keep that quiet for now. try to keep it quiet as he may Martinez may not realize just how loud FIUs offense has been PERIOD

FIU   SBC just about shouted its arrival in April when they scored  runs in six games leading them to a sweep of Florida AM and Troy the team they were chosen to tie for first place with in the SBC preseason poll PERIOD

Im not going to lie it feels a lot like it did last year when we ran off that 15game win streak added Martinez PERIOD Our team right now is clicking on all cylinders. the recent surge vaulted FIU to the top three in hits third average first slugging third and onbase percentage second PERIOD

HENRY WINS AWARD

Jabari Henrys teammates and fans were not the only ones to notice his colossal week at the plate PERIOD

Henry was named Louisville Sluggers National Player of the Week on April  PERIOD Its the second time in his career he garners the honors PERIOD He won it last on March   PERIOD

In his last  games Henry is hitting . with six home runs and  RBIs PERIOD

On April  Henry hit two home runs in game two in the Troy series the second of which was a game winner in the eighth inning after trailing all night PERIOD

CAJUN BRAWL

The Panthers travel  miles west to take on University of LouisianaLafayette for game one of a threegame series tonight at  p.m PERIOD EDT PERIOD

The Ragin Cajuns   SBC are a couple of notches below FIU in the standings sitting at sixth place in the Sun Belt Conference PERIOD As opposed to FIU whos won  of their last  games the Cajuns have lost nine of their last  games PERIOD

The last time these two teams faced off FIU took two out of three games from the Cajuns last April and beat them again in the Sun Belt tournament in May PERIOD

ULL has failed to impress at the plate this season being in the bottom third in the conference in average slugging onbase percentage runs RBIs hits and home runs PERIOD

Only three Cajuns have eclipsed the benchmark batting average mark . and only one Dylan Butler has more than one home run and  RBIs PERIOD

If the last two weekend series are indication the Panthers will trot out Mason McVay  . michael Ellis  . and R.J Fondon  . pERIOD

The Cajuns will send out Jordan Nicholson  . chris Griffitt  . and Jordan Harrison  . pERIOD

Harrison won SBC Pitcher of the Week on April  after pitching a completegame onehitter against Western Kentucky on April  PERIOD It was the first onehitter for the Cajuns since  PERIOD
