The LSU College of Music and Dramatic Arts hosts a concert in the Art and Design building on Thursday Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

LSU School of Music classes involve more than just a textbook and lectures they include performances lessons and rehearsals PERIOD These classes had to adapt to online learning with a lack of human interaction and performance opportunity but the faculty learned from the experience and will use it for the upcoming semester PERIOD

LSU School of Music Director James Byo said the switch to online classes for performance majors was not ideal but the School of Music faculty and students were able to learn a lot from the transition PERIOD

A number of faculty learned a lot about themselves about their courses and about our students by having had to completely shift their thinking their paradigm about the subject matter and class content Byo said PERIOD

Byo said the School of Music received various amounts of feedback from students about the transition to online learning PERIOD He said the students were serious and constructive in their responses and the School of Music learned from the transition PERIOD

Our faculty just really in a very good spirit went to work hard at making the adaptations that were necessary and just figuring things out as they went Byo said PERIOD That meant that courses were delivered in a number of different ways. the School of Music has three types of classes traditional lecture classes applied oneonone lessons and ensembles PERIOD

Byo said the applied lessons classes worked well online through Zoom or other services PERIOD

The fidelity of the sound is where faculty learned to make some adjustments in the system such that the sound could be anywhere from reasonably good to quite good in terms of the quality Byo said PERIOD

Faculty found that lessons conducted in this way were productive and more intense according to Byo PERIOD He said students and faculty paid a different type of attention to their lessons over Zoom PERIOD In addition to oneonone lessons some students also recorded themselves performing or practicing and faculty provided feedback during their lessons PERIOD

Byo said a problem exists with online learning involving larger instruments like percussion instruments and pianos PERIOD Many students are dependent on LSU to provide instruments and did not have access to them because campus buildings were closed PERIOD

We actually moved some pianos from the School of Music to the homes or the apartments of piano majors who didnt have instruments where they lived Byo said PERIOD

Because there was no access to campus buildings and social distancing measures were in place the ensemble classes looked different online or did not happen at all PERIOD

Byo said some ensembles did a collage concert where students recorded themselves singing at home and the videos were edited together to create a concert PERIOD

Byo said for the fall plans are already being made for each type of class to protect against the spread of COVID19 PERIOD

Our priority is the safety of our people Byo said PERIOD Were going to do all the things we have to do the safety measures of distancing and masks and disinfectant. for traditional lecture classes the School of Music is being sensitive to classroom capacity and social distancing PERIOD Byo said faculty of this class type may choose to hold some classes inperson and some online PERIOD

Byo plans to move lessons to larger classrooms and spaces so that social distancing can be enforced PERIOD He said there are a variety of rooms and spaces to house these lessons in including the outdoor amphitheater PERIOD

Byo said the department is ordering two trifold plexiglass barriers for each faculty members office to protect the professor and student during lessons and interactions PERIOD

Ensembles will be broken into smaller groups such as quartets or quintets PERIOD Byo said they will be held in larger spaces with each student seated behind a plexiglass unit PERIOD

They will perform and rehearse in small groups of people anywhere from four to  in a large space Byo said PERIOD Our ensemble directors would just switch gears and move from large ensemble people to small ensemble people. byo said the faculty has met frequently about moving forward and being flexible in the upcoming semester PERIOD

We need to be okay with the idea that were going to have to pivot on a dime at some point and just change because circumstances change Byo said PERIOD

Vocal Music Education sophomore Rebecca Chappell said the biggest challenge in moving online was losing the human interaction with other musicians PERIOD She said this was particularly hard in her voice lessons PERIOD On campus she had an accompanist who played with her and followed her while she was singing but online she had a recording to follow PERIOD

We couldnt make music together the same way we could in personMany people put their instruments down and are still having trouble getting back to practicing with not many performance opportunitiesI appreciated that they were open to conversations on fixing their new ways of teachingSubmit to let the Reveilles student journalists know PERIOD
