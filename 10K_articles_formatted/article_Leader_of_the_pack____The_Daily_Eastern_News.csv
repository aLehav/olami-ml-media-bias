Sometimes its not the finish but the leadership an athlete displays PERIOD



Hes known as The Beast or Granddad by the freshmen on the team PERIOD

Whatever hes called junior mens track and field captain Chris Wesson is definitely an important part to mens track and fields 800meter crew PERIOD

Wesson finished second in the 800meter run  minute . seconds at the Ohio Valley Conference Indoor Championships last year PERIOD He finished second in the  . two weeks ago at this years OVC Indoor Championships PERIOD

Last year he missed first by two hundredths of a second PERIOD This year he lost first to teammate David Holm PERIOD

But when his teammates and coaches the members of the 800crew were asked about Wesson their first response was that he was that hes a good captain a good leader PERIOD

He gets you motivated without being a jerk or anything said freshmen  runners Mike Connolly and Jason Springer PERIOD He leads by example. wesson describes the 800crew as a combination of the whacky crazy personalities seen on the long distance crew and the sprinters who appear to have a chip on their shoulders PERIOD

One of the guys that has helped him throughout the year the most has been the very guy that beat him out for first David Holm PERIOD

Wesson said Holm has been by his side for much of the year for practice and has been a great help as he is a great runner himself PERIOD

Its not really that Im beating out a teammate Holm said PERIOD Its that we trained all year for it PERIOD Its just a race and it came down to that I beat him out. holm said as a group they do their long runs together and the two will usually lead the group together PERIOD

He always gets on everyone to make sure that theyre doing their thing and is always motivating people Holm said PERIOD

Mens head track coach Tom Akers said he brings a lot of leadership to the 800crew which he believes to be a closelyknit group PERIOD

That crew has done a really good job in bringing in some team unity and of course Chris is a really big part of that Akers said PERIOD

As far as racing Wesson contributes losing to Holm to also running the 1500meter race and feeling just a little too tired to make the firstplace finish PERIOD

Its a real intense race Wesson said PERIOD As an 800runner its like the Marines PERIOD You can do the  you can do the mile. when he lost the 800meter last season he remembers losing control of the race in the final  meters PERIOD

Youre running as fast as you can and you cant even feel your legs he said PERIOD

Unlike last year where Wesson described his running style as being a sitter he would wait until the latter part of the race to sprint he is trying to change that strategy PERIOD

So far he said he is happy with how its working out PERIOD

He definitely has the ability to make it to the NCAA level and compete with the best athletes in college Holm said PERIOD

But for now old Granddad Wesson has more modest plans and hopes to run near  in the 800meter run PERIOD
