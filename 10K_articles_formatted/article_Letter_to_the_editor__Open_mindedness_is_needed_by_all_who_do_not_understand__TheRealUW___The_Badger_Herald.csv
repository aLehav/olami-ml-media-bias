As a black student going to a university that cherishes diversity and strives for a more integrated community is extremely important to me PERIOD

But this is not why I am a student at University of Wisconsin PERIOD As a graduate of one of the best public high schools in the United States I was already accustomed to a certain level of diversity in race ethnicity class sexual orientation and religious backgrounds I knew UW would never be able to compete with PERIOD But as I received the opportunity to attend a toptier research institution for free for four years I thought its overwhelmingly monochromatic population was worth dealing with PERIOD

But the environment has never felt right for me and I know based on notsorare incidents in my Wisconsin experience I am not in a safe place in what has been my temporary home for three years now PERIOD

I fully understand the impact these hate crimes have on all of us us being the students of color on campus us being women on campus and most prominently us being the entirety of TheRealUW community PERIOD

Confronting TheRealUW Marginalized students reveal experiences of an unwelcoming campusLauna Owens a 19yearold black freshman at University of Wisconsin woke up slightly late for class Thursday morning in her Read

TheRealUW has acted as a voice to protest not only racism but how little UW does to protect the victims and punish the perpetrators PERIOD Only after seeing what some call a very offensive poster with our mascot dressed as a KKK member and groups of students standing outside protesting did some students feel so dutifully inclined to involve themselves and see exactly what is going on PERIOD

The problem is that a politicized image of Bucky raises more gall than the reports of black and Asian students being spat on berated and threatened in their temporary homes PERIOD This desensitization of the harm done to an actual human being while our mascot receives more reverence is exactly why TheRealUWs work is needed PERIOD

Voices of UW These stories are critical in describing what it really feels like to be a marginalized student on UWs campusIn light of recent events of hate and bias on the University of Wisconsin campus students have been using TheRealUW Read

I absolutely understand why they are protesting but as a result of think pieces Ive read as well as conversations Ive had with multiple students Ive come to realize the portion of the population incited to investigate TheRealUW doesnt actually understand it  at all PERIOD

Many agree UW has not taken the best approach to tangibly addressing incidents of racial bias and aggression on this campus PERIOD But TheRealUW has opened themselves to dialogue about how to improve the campus climate only to be met with such hostilities from the student body as being called distasteful and pushing intimidation and fear. there are also clearly false notions that the members of TheRealUW are antiwhite people and think all white people are racists which is so laughably untrue it almost does not deserve a response PERIOD But alas it seems they are not able to critique the actions or lack thereof of their white counterparts without being called racist PERIOD

If you are someone who subscribes to the belief that the tactfulness of students of color should merit the respect we get here are a few things to consider

If you have celebrated the lazy critiques that claim TheRealUW is not openminded I beg to ask where your open mind is PERIOD We have a group of students who are telling us they have been hurt by members of this campus community without any immediate support from the institution PERIOD They are asking us to support them and validate their experiences PERIOD They are expressing their frustration not hate through their voices their clothing and their overall platform PERIOD

Instead of garnering the backup of fellow students they are being told they will not be supported because they are so loud and their voices so cacophonous PERIOD Too many students are making this an issue about what TheRealUW should be doing instead of making it about what we as an entire campus should be doing to help them create a much needed change PERIOD
