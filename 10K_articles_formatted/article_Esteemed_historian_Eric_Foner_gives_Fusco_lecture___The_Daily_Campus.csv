Eric Foner DeWitt Clinton Professor of Columbia University speaks on Tuesday about the Underground Railroad PERIOD Foner discussed the history behind the railroad in Konover Auditorium on Tuesday Oct.  PERIOD Tyler BentonThe Daily Campus

On Oct PERIOD  the Department of History hosted Columbia professor Eric Foner as its seventeenth annual Fusco Distinguished Lecture guest PERIOD Foner is a renowned author and professor and has served as the president of many historical organizations PERIOD

Foner was introduced by UConn history professor Manisha Sinha who spoke highly of his accomplishments as an historian and the contributions he has made to the community PERIOD Manisha Sinha said that Foner has written for multiple newspaper publications and has appeared on popular shows like The Daily Show and The Colbert Report PERIOD

Once Foner took the podium the audience was instantly engaged PERIOD In his latest book Gateway to Freedom The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad Foner brings to light the stories of runaway slaves as told by a journalist and member of the Underground Railroad Sydney Howard Gay PERIOD

Gay had extensively recorded the stories of runaway slaves that he assisted through New York City asking for firsthand accounts of their experiences as slaves PERIOD Most historical records of escaped slaves were taken many years after the Civil War had ended making Gays documents invaluable in understanding the lives of escaped slaves PERIOD

Gays documents had not been too frequently cited by other historians which gave Foner a new and unique plethora of information PERIOD Foner happened upon these documents by pure chance as an undergraduate student of his had stumbled upon the documents in the Columbia University Archives when writing an unrelated piece of her own PERIOD

Eric Foner said that in recent years the Underground Railroad had regained the interest of historians and the general public PERIOD He then gave a brief but informative history of the Underground Railroad PERIOD

Foner spoke about the different stops along the Underground Railroad beginning in southern Pennsylvania and ending in Canada PERIOD Other stops included Philadelphia New York City and the abolitionist hot bed of Syracuse PERIOD

Foner described the lengths that many slaves had to go attain freedom citing the case of Henry Box Brown a slave who escaped by shipping himself as cargo to abolitionists in Pennsylvania PERIOD

Foner said that escaped slaves would have to leave the country in order to be safe from laws like The Fugitive Slave Act of  which authorized the use of Federal Marshals to track down escaped slaves even in the north PERIOD

After the Civil War began slaves no longer had to leave the country to be free which soon made the Underground Railroad obsolete PERIOD

One of my professors studied under Foner when he was in college and said he was a fantastic lecturer said Nick Diverniero a seventhsemester history and economics major PERIOD I found it really interesting that there were still undiscovered documents being found. lauren Brown is a campus correspondent for The Daily Campus PERIOD She can be reached via email at lauren.brownuconn.edu PERIOD
