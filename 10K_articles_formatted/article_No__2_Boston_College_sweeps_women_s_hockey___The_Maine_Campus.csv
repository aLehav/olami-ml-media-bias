In the first of a two game weekend series the University of Maine womens hockey team found themselves overwhelmed by undefeated Boston College as the Eagles shutout the Black Bears  on Saturday afternoon at the Alfond Arena PERIOD With three assists and a goal fourthyear forward Alex Carpenter gave Maine nightmares all over the ice PERIOD After the shutout the Black Bears have now gone eight consecutive periods without a score a concern spanning almost three games PERIOD

The statement victory helped the Eagles continue their perfect season as they rose to  overall with a  mark within Hockey East PERIOD With their sixth straight loss the Black Bears are helplessly watching as their season slips away falling to  on the year with a  standing in Hockey East games PERIOD

Though many teams would be nervous facing the No PERIOD  nationally ranked program the Black Bears looked at the contest like just another game PERIOD

We scout their power play we scout their penalty kill see what theyre doing on their forechecks and just prepare for them like any other team Head Coach Richard Reichenbach said PERIOD

Being the clearcut favorites heading into the matchup the Eagles lived up to their expectations coming out and scoring immediately PERIOD Secondyear defenseman Kali Flanagan snuck the puck by one defenders stick and then into the net giving Boston the early  advantage PERIOD

Eight minutes later Boston was back at it PERIOD Carpenter sent a perfect pass to secondyear forward Haley Skarupa who shot the puck behind fourthyear goaltender Meghann Treacy PERIOD The score put the Eagles up by two heading into the second period PERIOD

Three minutes after the intermission secondyear defenseman Kaliya Johnson rushed towards Maines goal PERIOD Sliding for the save too early Treacy left the net wide open allowing Johnson to grab both an easy point and a  lead PERIOD

Immediately following Bostons third unanswered point the Black Bears desperately needed a change of scenery in goal PERIOD Thirdyear goaltender Mariah Fujimagari came in for Treacy PERIOD For a shortterm solution it paid off as Fujimagari stopped all nine shots that came her way in the last few minutes of the second period PERIOD

With the help of two successful power plays the Eagles managed to beat Fujimagari twice in the final period PERIOD The first of which came when Carpenter shot a dart into the back of the net passing Fujimagari before she could even react PERIOD

The second power play goal came with  minutes left on the clock when Flanagan scored her second point PERIOD On the play Carpenter sent the puck to Flanagan who gently knocked it into the left hand corner of the goal preserving the  win for the Eagles PERIOD

The biggest challenge the Black Bears faced in the contest was getting behind Bostons secondyear goaltender Katie Burt PERIOD Playing nearly perfectly in the net Burt stopped all  shots that came in her direction helping her to record her seventh shutout of the season PERIOD In goal for Maine Fujimagari saved  of the  attempts that came her way as she had a slightly better performance than Treacy who stopped  of  shots PERIOD

When it came down to getting pressure Boston outshot Maine  PERIOD In addition the Eagles went  on power plays while the Black Bears went  PERIOD Though they did have some solid moments on defense at times the Black Bears made some poor decisions passing on offense a mistake that hurt them greatly PERIOD

I think for the most part except for some turnovers our systems were really good at eliminating odd man rushes we just have got to handle the puck better Reichenbach said PERIOD

Though they lost the Black Bears played their hearts out against one of the best teams in the nation PERIOD Moving forward Maine intends to learn from this loss so they can get better down the road PERIOD

We did a lot of really good things obviously were not happy anytime we lose but I think there were a lot of positives and well look at the video and see what we can do and see what we can adjust Reichenbach said PERIOD

BC completes sweep with  victory

Maine was outmatched once again in game two dropping the contest  to complete the weekend series PERIOD Maine had to piece together a game while missing seven players including many of their senior players PERIOD

The Eagles flew high on offense as  different players had points PERIOD Goal scorers for Boston College BC included secondyears Megan Keller  Kenzie Kent and Tori Sullivan PERIOD ThirdYear forward Andie Anastos and fourthyear forward Alex Carpenter chipped in as well PERIOD

Maines two goals came from thirdyear forward Morgan Sakundiak and fourthyear forward Audra Richards PERIOD

The game saw four different goalies in net PERIOD Boston College started secondyear Katie Burt and Maine led off with thirdyear Mariah Fujimagari PERIOD

Burt made three saves in the first while Fujimagari faced  shots stopping  and allowing four goals PERIOD

Both teams switched goalies at the end of the first the Eagles to secondyear Gabriella Switaj and the Black Bears to Meghann Treacy PERIOD Switaj made  saves and allowed two while Treacy made  saves in relief PERIOD

BCs offense overpowered the Maine defense and outshot the Black Bears  PERIOD They were also  on the power play taking  shots while they had the man advantage PERIOD Maine was  on the power play during the game PERIOD

BC owned the Black Bears in the first period jumping out to a four goal lead and outshooting Maine  PERIOD

I thought we had a good first  minutes and then we got into penalty trouble Maine Head Coach Richard Reichenbach said PERIOD Obviously we went down  real quick. theyre a smart team their puck movement is quick and its hard to read what theyre going to do Richards said PERIOD

Skarupa would tally the first goal of the game by tipping a shot by secondyear defenseman Megan Keller in front of Fujimagari beating her five hole to give the Eagles an early  lead PERIOD

Maines defense and Fujimagari would hold out until the  mark when a Maine penalty led to a power play opportunity for the Eagles PERIOD Carpenter would find the puck at the point and onetime a shot by Fujimagari to up the lead to  just as the penalty expired PERIOD

Just over a minute later Bender would score in a fouronfour situation following up on a rebound off the right pad of Fujimagari what sat out in the slot PERIOD Bender crashed the net and poked the puck through the fivehole to score her fourth of the year PERIOD

The Eagles would score again on the 4on4 when a scramble in front of the net resulted in a turnover PERIOD Maines defense turned aside two shots but the third was sent topshelf by Anastos to give BC a  lead PERIOD

It was to give Switaj some more time on the ice BC Head Coach Katie Crowley said PERIOD Shes been able to go out and give Burt a couple of breaks PERIOD This was a chance for her to jump into the game cold and she settled in nicely by the third period. the Black Bears got the first goals of the second period after both teams switched goalies PERIOD Sakundiak was able to take advantage of the power play that carried over to the second and scored on a short he was deflected through the pads of Switaj to cut the BC lead to  PERIOD

Richards would score her teamleading ninth goal of the season  minutes later when secondyear forward Brooke Stacey carried the puck into the offensive zone PERIOD Richards crashed the net and got a stick on Staceys pass through the slot PERIOD

The deflected shot beat Switaj and the Black Bears pulled within two PERIOD

I saw Stacey going and I was going to change but I saw her cross to the other side so I decided to drive the net Richards said PERIOD I knew she was going to throw it on the net whether it was a shot or pass. not to be outdone the Eagles scored twice before the end of the period PERIOD Sullivan scored less than a minute after Staceys goal lifting the puck over the blocker of Treacy who had relieved Fujimagari PERIOD

BC scored again on a nice passing play that saw Carpenter feed a pass through to Kent who tapped it past Treacy to extend the lead to four again PERIOD

Maine put together a solid third period but could not get the puck past Switaj who made  saves in the frame PERIOD

BC would score on the power play at the  mark when a shot from the point hit Keller in the chest PERIOD The puck deflected off of her and bounced right into the goal PERIOD That would cap the scoring at  PERIOD

On the scoreboard they definitely dominated us but I thought there were times where we were able to make good puck decisions sustain shifts in their zone set up our power play PERIOD Our penalty kill was better tonight PERIOD Those are things we want to focus on and grow Reichenbach said on the things he will take away from the weekend PERIOD

Were playing hard and were learning from every game as the season goes on and hopefully that will continue Crowley said after the game PERIOD We have some very talented players on our teamI think theyve done a great job this season with staying within themselves PERIOD and within our systems. after the sweep Maine drops its seventh straight game and falls to   WHEA. bC remains undefeated and leads WHEA with a record of   WHEA. maine will take the ice once again at home for the final series of the first half of the season taking on the Union College Dutchmen on Dec PERIOD  and  PERIOD
