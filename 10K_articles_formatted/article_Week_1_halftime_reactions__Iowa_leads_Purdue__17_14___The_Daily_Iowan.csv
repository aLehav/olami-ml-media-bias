West Lafayette Indiana USA Iowa Hawkeyes running back Tyler Goodson  celebrates a run in the first quarter against the Purdue Boilermakers at RossAde Stadium on Saturday Oct PERIOD   PERIOD Trevor Ruszkowski  USA TODAY

Robert Read and Austin Hanson October  

WEST LAFAYETTE Ind PERIOD  Iowa leads Purdue  at halftime of the teams seasonopener PERIOD DI Pregame Editor Robert Read and Sports Editor Austin Hanson react to the first half of play PERIOD

Iowa pass defense has no answers for David Bell

Purdues top receiver Rondale Moore is out but David Bell is giving the Hawkeyes a lot of problems PERIOD

Again PERIOD

Last season when Iowa beat Purdue at Kinnick Stadium Bell then a freshman caught  passes for  yards and a touchdown PERIOD In the first half on Saturday Bell has nine receptions for  yards and two scores PERIOD Whether its battling defenders and hauling in a contested grab or working his way open on preciselyrun routes Bell has been a problem for the Iowa defense PERIOD

Purdue quarterback Aiden OConnell has also for the most part looked sharp in the first half PERIOD Hes completed 17of26 passes for the Boilermakers including the two scoring strikes to Bell PERIOD At the end of the half Iowa cornerback Matt Hankins did secure an interception that led to Keith Duncans goahead field goal PERIOD

If Iowa can somewhat contain David Bell it should control the second half PERIOD Im sure Phil Parker is saying something similar in a much more intense way in Iowas locker room PERIOD

Hawkeye rushing attack working in first half

The Iowa offense sputtered early against Purdue but the Hawkeye running game has been a highlight for the team in the first half PERIOD

Iowa ran the ball  times in the first half for  yards and two touchdowns in the first half and did so in a variety of ways PERIOD Running back Tyler Goodson leads the team with  rushing yards and has taken two direct snaps out of the Wild Cat formation PERIOD Goodson also leads Iowa with  yards on five receptions PERIOD

Ihmir Smith Marsette has been involved on the ground too PERIOD He has two carries for  yards including  on a reverse that had scoring potential had Tyler Linderbaum secured his block down field PERIOD

Meanwhile Ivory KellyMartin is averaging . yards per rush and Mekhi Sargent scored his first touchdown of the season on a 1yard touchdown PERIOD Quarterback Spencer Petras scored his first TD of the season on the ground as well with a QB sneak early in the second quarter PERIOD

One of the few negatives in the running game was Goodson fumbling in the first quarter after one of his offensive linemen Cole Banwart ran into him PERIOD

Petras heats up heading to halftime

Spencer Petras first quarter as Iowas starting quarterback didnt go quite as he had envisioned PERIOD The sophomore from San Rafael California got off to a shaky start completing just two of his first eight passes PERIOD Petras didnt complete a pass to any of his wide receivers until midway through the second quarter PERIOD

As the second quarter opened up Petras didnt look much better missing a wideopen Shaun Beyer on second and  from the Iowa  PERIOD

However as the clock began to run down in the first half Petras heated up PERIOD He converted his next six pass attempts after missing Beyer PERIOD

After a Matt Hankins interception with  seconds to go in the half Petras came up big for Iowa PERIOD He completed threestraight passes to set up a Keith Duncan field goal and give Iowa a  lead at halftime PERIOD

In total Petras finished the half  for  yards and one rushing touchdown completing  of his last  throws PERIOD

While Petras certainly benefited from Iowas impressive rushing performance in the first half it was clear that the offense would go as he went PERIOD When Petras struggled early Iowas offense couldnt get on the board PERIOD When he heated up late the Hawkeyes found their rhythm and scored some points PERIOD

As has been the expectation all offseason the Hawkeyes will go as far as Spencer Petras can take them he showed that in the first half PERIOD In the second half Petras will have to prove that his poor play early was due to pregame jitters and that he can play consistently going forward PERIOD
