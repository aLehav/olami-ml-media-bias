We all know that this election has been as chaotic and anxiety provoking as this COVIDstricken year PERIOD We understand that there is a lot riding on this election our values our beliefs and the potential of lifealtering change PERIOD With all of these important issues on the line it isnt a surprise that this subject is in fact a sticky one especially when talking to someone who has differing views from yourself PERIOD For that reason I feel the need to share an important message with you all PERIOD

First and foremost this election is a big one it affects everyone PERIOD Even if youre not the type of person that likes to discuss your political views this election isnt giving you the chance to slide under the radar PERIOD Americas political scene is too polarizing and too deeply divided to allow for that PERIOD And yes political discussions can be scary PERIOD They cause conflict they can get argumentative and they are something that many people choose to avoid all together PERIOD But avoidance isnt the answer to solving this issue and its not the answer thats going to cut it this year PERIOD In fact avoiding these discussions leads to further conflict and doesnt allow you to learn and understand your views as they relate to other people PERIOD This logic of avoidance is extremely ineffective and doesnt get us anywhere PERIOD Thats why we need to understand the proactive stances we can take in order to have political discussions in a way that is beneficial to both parties and gives both people a chance to not just express their views but to learn from the other person and allow for growth PERIOD

When approaching a political discussion it is important to first understand whether or not the other person in the conversation has views similar to or different from you PERIOD Once you understand the stance of that person it is important that you next decide whether or not the moment is right to have that discussion PERIOD If the moment isnt right simply extend an invitation to have that conversation another time that way you dont bombard this person with a conversation they may not wish to have PERIOD Clearly this is easier said than done but by presenting the subject in a way that gives the other person a chance to decide to or not to talk about politics it allows for a sense of reassurance that makes the subject a lot lighter and less stressful for all those involved PERIOD

That being said when the time comes and the conversation arises there are a few common rules to follow in order to avoid this conversation turning into an unproductive and problem invoking debate PERIOD

First and foremost create a sense of trust and assurance PERIOD Let the person know that this conversation isnt going to lead to a friendship breakup and that you can have differing views and still be friends PERIOD Once that is out in the air make sure to avoid attacking their beliefs should they not be the same as yours because that is what makes these conversations so polarizing PERIOD It isnt easy to do this but by allowing the other person to express their views entirely before you express yours allows for both people to get their messages across in a way that feels inviting and productive PERIOD

More than anything just make sure that you do your absolute best to not insult or offend the other partys views PERIOD Our political views are deeply rooted in our beliefs and our core values and therefore are directly tied to our emotions PERIOD

All in all everyone has difficulty when it comes to having discussions with people that may not agree or that may not understand where youre coming from PERIOD Everyone understands that politics are polarizing that they are confusing and can cause a lot of conflict PERIOD Thats why especially this election season we have to rise above the anxiety and the fear of political discussions because they are going to be inevitable PERIOD This election is one for the books and the results of it will go down in history PERIOD The president of one of the most unprecedented times in American history is going to be elected and regardless of who wins their policies will go on to affect everyone PERIOD For this reason I believe that we should all take notice of our own views and do what we can to help educate our neighbors and to do our part in having these difficult conversations in order to understand our own views and learn to understand others as well PERIOD
