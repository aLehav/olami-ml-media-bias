Updated November     pm





Poet novelist and essayist Erika Snchez reads from and discusses her new book I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter. five years ago a young Latina author set out to write a book she would have wanted to read growing up one focused on an audience of young people of color PERIOD

Novelist poet and essayist Erika Snchez from Cicero Illinois read from her new novel I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter on Tuesday in the Krannert Auditorium to a nearly full room PERIOD

The event hosted by the Delta Phi Mu sorority and Purdues Latino Cultural Center consisted of a book reading and a QA session followed by a book signing PERIOD

After a brief introduction from the Delta Phi Mu president Brenda Balcazar Snchez took the stage in the warm room and jumped into her reading PERIOD

What surprised me most about seeing my sister dead is the lingering smirk on her face Snchez said PERIOD

This as the first line of the book sets it apart immediately in a genre that may not have expected something so jarring PERIOD

Snchez tells the story of Julia a daughter of Mexican immigrants PERIOD She must react to the loss of her older sister Olga who is hit by a truck in Chicago PERIOD

One main theme the protagonist upholds throughout the plot is that of dissent PERIOD The book has received negative criticism for representing young Latina women in that way PERIOD

Snchez doesnt mind if people do not see what she was trying to do with her main character PERIOD

One thing I learned along the way was that everyone is not going to like everything about the book Snchez said PERIOD

The author wanted to create a story she would have wanted to read for herself when she was in high school but that was not necessarily written at the time PERIOD She has received messages from adult women who retroactively enjoyed the book and told her they wished it had been available when they were younger PERIOD

After a 20minute reading session during which Snchez read exclusively from the beginning of the book in order to avoid spoilers the floor was opened for questions PERIOD

The author received a question about her first book a collection of poetry titled Lessons on Expulsion Poems and whether she saw herself as more of a poet or a novelist PERIOD

I am a poet first Snchez said PERIOD It took me  years to write my poetry book and five years to write my new book and the poetry book was much shorter PERIOD It shows in this book that I have to break down every sentence and go over it over and over again. asked about the juxtaposition between Julia and her mother in the book the author said she wanted to see more stories on that kind of subject matter PERIOD

I think being the daughter of immigrants is a really unique experience Snchez said PERIOD Immigrant childrens voices are necessary in literature. gabriella Rene a junior in the College of Liberal Arts attended the talk PERIOD

Its nice to see women of color being represented at Purdue she said PERIOD

Erika Snchez is working on a book of essays which she said would be called Crying in the Bathroom along with recently having I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter being optioned for film PERIOD

The next event sponsored by the Latino Cultural Center and cosponsored by Delta Pi Rho fraternity will be The Trouble with my Name A OneMan Show with Javier vila at  p.m PERIOD April  in the Gordon Mallett Theatre in Pao Hall PERIOD
