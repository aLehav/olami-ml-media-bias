Generally clear PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Although the actual lacrosse season doesnt begin until February it appeared Friday night that the ECU mens lacrosse squad was already in midseason form as they walked away with a convincing  victory over UNCW PERIOD

The Seahawks were quickly overwhelmed with the Pirates potent offense led by Jamie Montgomery who scored the first goal of the night for either team PERIOD With some brilliantly schemed plays ECU lit up the scoreboard with five goals in the first period alone PERIOD

Even though the Seahawks managed three goals of their own in the first quarter they were the victims of some vicious hits laid out by the Pirate defensemen PERIOD

On one such play as UNCW tried to break away for a fast break a Pirate player came dashing across the field lowered his shoulder and delivered a devastating hit to the opposing player PERIOD With such amazing for behind the blow the Seahawk went airborne into a trashcan on the sidelines sending the crowd of nearly  fans into a frenzy PERIOD

In the second period the Pirates further padded their lead going into halftime by tacking on four more goals to make the score  at the break PERIOD

The second half was a display of defensive excellence from both teams as the two combined for only three goals PERIOD The defensive explosion was too little too late for the Seahawks as the pitifully executed first half proved to be fatal PERIOD

The men and womens lacrosse teams have a huge tournament coming up on the weekend of Nov PERIOD fifteenth PERIOD There will be eight teams in the mens field and six on the womens side PERIOD
