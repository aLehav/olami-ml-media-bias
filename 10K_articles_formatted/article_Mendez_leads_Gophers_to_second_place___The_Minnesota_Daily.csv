Minnesotas mens golf team finished up Tuesday with a team score of 18over par good for a secondplace finish at the Duck Invitational in Eugene Ore PERIOD

The Gophers sat all alone in fourth at the start of the third and final round but consistent play coupled with an implosion from Oregon and Loyola Marymount paved the way to a secondplace spot on the podium PERIOD

Oregon State blew away the rest of the field with a final team score of 9over par PERIOD

We had confidence coming into this event head coach John Carlson said and I really think the guys really came through for us. carlson said the thirdround conditions were especially poor because of wind and rain PERIOD

It was probably as difficult a golf course well see in college this year Carlson said PERIOD

Those conditions didnt seem to affect Minnesota freshman Jose Mendez PERIOD

Mendez tied for the individual crown with an aggregate score of 3under par PERIOD His previous bestfinish before the victory was a tie for sixth earlier this year PERIOD

I cant believe I won because I didnt expect to win at all during my freshman year he said PERIOD Im just really happy with myself. mendez shot a 1under par on the final day of play to secure the victory PERIOD

We knew the kind of player we were getting in him when he came to campus Carlson said of Mendez PERIOD He is comfortable in the lead  and now with a win under his belt the skys the limit for him. mendez became the first individual winner in Carlsons fouryear tenure and he gave the Gophers their first individual victory since  PERIOD

Minnesota senior Jon Trasamar was second on the team and tied for twelfth overall with a final score of 4over par PERIOD Sophomore Jon DuToit 8over par came after Trasamar and was followed by senior Alex Gaugert 14over par and freshman Matt Rachey17over par PERIOD

I think I was most proud of the fact that everyone on the team contributed in each of the three rounds Carlson said PERIOD It was a total team effort and now we have our eyes set on bigger and better things. minnesota has been at a slight disadvantage to start the season compared to teams on the West Coast PERIOD While those teams have the added luxury of practicing outdoors the Gophers have spent much of the last three months cooped up inside PERIOD

Still Carlson said he doesnt let his team use weather as an excuse PERIOD

I dont think weather has really affected us he said PERIOD It goes to show that hard work perseverance and confidence in our abilities goes a long way in this sport. minnesota will have a slight break when it returns to the Twin Cities PERIOD And with the weather steadily improving it might get to practice outdoors sometime nextweek PERIOD

Mendez said hes ready to get outside PERIOD

Its not a big deal practicing indoors he said but there is nothing like practicing outdoors and watching the ball fly PERIOD Im excited for that. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
