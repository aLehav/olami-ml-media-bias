The audience at the first installment of the  Plutzik Reading Series mostly held its applause for poet Yusef Komunyakaa until the end of the program so as not to interrupt his intricate cadence PERIOD But the impulse to clap or snap or emit some sonic response to Komunyakaas entrancing rhythms could be felt as sparse applause bubbled up in between readings PERIOD
The Plutzik Reading Series is known for its uncompromising devotion to acknowledging some of the greatest artists of our time and is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary this year in conjunction with the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of professor and poet Hyam Plutzik for whom the series was posthumously named PERIOD
The University will be celebrating the Series semicentennial by hosting a variety of artists whose work has endured over time PERIOD For this reason Komunyakaas appearance in the WellesBrown Room this past Thursday could not have been more appropriate PERIOD
To catalogue Komunyakaas collection of grants awards and commendations would  as English professor and poet Jennifer Grotz cited in her introduction  steal the thunder from the gorgeous poetry which you are about to hear  Komunyakaas poetry is so versatile and so shapeshifting. she added It would take me quite a while to do his forms and subjects  his fusion of music and image  the justice it deserves. it is of course impossible to talk about Komunyakaas work without mentioning music PERIOD Komunyakaas poetry refers to a kind of verse that at once incorporates and embodies the wild and seductive rhythms of blues and jazz while never appearing untempered  these rhythms are always meticulously arranged PERIOD
Take for example this excerpt from his poem Blue Light Lounge Sutra for the Performance Poets at Harold Park Hotel with which he closed the reading

the need gotta be
so deep words cant
answer simple questions
all night long notes
stumble off the tongue
 color the air indigo
so deep fragments of gut
 flesh cling to the song
you gotta get into it

These images are tantalizing but they would not exist as such without the equally potent rhythms evoking the kind of madness and dizziness we associate with Eros dopamine and bebop PERIOD Komunyakaa could not keep himself still as he read PERIOD His knee twisted with each long stress as his ascot hat bobbed up and down keeping time PERIOD He was simultaneously possessed by the rhythm and in control of it as he sped toward the end of the poem PERIOD
After a moment applause filled the room PERIOD Komunyakaas poetry belonging to the same class of musical virtuosity as Dickinson and Ginsberg is best heard aloud PERIOD Komunyakaa has a need so deep that he works on several projects at once and appears to have no intention of stopping PERIOD UR is lucky to have been graced with his presence PERIOD
In celebration of its fiftieth anniversary the Plutzik Reading Series will continue this semester with readings from Irish poet Eavon Boland and Philip Levine the newly appointed U.S PERIOD poet laureate PERIOD
