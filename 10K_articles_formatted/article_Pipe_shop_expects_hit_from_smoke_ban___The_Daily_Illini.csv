I think the smoking ban will be devastating said Patrick Callaghan the proprietor of Jons Pipe Shop PERIOD He purchased the pipe shop while enrolled at the University and became trained in tobacco blending in New York and the Dominican Republic PERIOD

Jons Pipe Shop keeps over  pipes  cigars and  different types of pipe tobacco Callaghan said PERIOD



He said he was concerned with where students would be able to smoke PERIOD

If they cant smoke in bars and they cant smoke in residence halls then where can the students smoke he asked PERIOD

Callaghan said that Jons is probably in the top  of tobacconists in the United States PERIOD

When students come to college they want to try different things including different types of tobacco Callaghan said PERIOD

Votingage people are supposed to make their own decisions Callaghan said PERIOD

The government should not make decisions for people in their private lives he added PERIOD

Our clientele are very educated PERIOD Its not that they dont understand the health risks with smoking Callaghan said PERIOD The most creative people are risk takers. customers become family quickly said Jerry Moore an employee at Jons PERIOD

I had an alumnus from the University come back and tell me that they learned more in here than in some classrooms he said PERIOD

Theyre amazed by our selection Callaghan said PERIOD

Pipe shops across the country have been forced out of business by smoking bans but Jons will be particularly affected due to their campus location he said PERIOD

We have an exemption being a smoke shop Callaghan said PERIOD He said other businesses that are frequently patronized by smokers like the numerous campus and workingclass bars would also be greatly affected PERIOD

Most businesses operate on a small margin and this ban is going to cut into that margin Callaghan said PERIOD
