Cross who has been involved with Haiti benefits in the past said that he was glad that so many people are getting involved PERIOD

Its sad that it took such a disaster to really get people motivated but Im happy to be a part of this Cross said PERIOD I was really honored that they contacted me to play I feel like Im out of my realm compared to some of the other groups. many of the bands featured in Fridays show have different styles from one another PERIOD The lineup promises to have something for all concertgoers from indie rock to pop covers to more experimental sounds PERIOD

Alicia Baratta and her boyfriendbandmate Jon Gallow are both Cal Poly alumni and local musical artists that will play during the sixhour event PERIOD

Its not like I can fly out there and help tomorrow and I dont have money to donate significantly and Im not a nurse who can help that way but through this show I can take something that Im good at love and would do anyway and use it to contribute to this good cause Baratta said PERIOD

The money from Hope for Haiti will go directly to doctors and medical staff who are currently volunteering in Haiti to give medical aid to those in need PERIOD One of the doctors who will be receiving funds is a San Luis Obispo native Dr PERIOD Scott Nelson PERIOD

Nelson could not be reached for an interview but did issue a short letter that can be seen on the concerts blog PERIOD The note said that Nelson is currently stationed in CapHatien about  miles north of PortauPrince where the quake was centered PERIOD Nelson described the quake in CapHatien as feeling like he had vertigo PERIOD Nelson has been actively working in PortauPrince since the magnitude seven earthquake hit PERIOD
