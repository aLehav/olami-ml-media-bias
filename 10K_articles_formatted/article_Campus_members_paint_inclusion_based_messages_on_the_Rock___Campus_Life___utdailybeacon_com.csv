Students faculty and administration gathered at the corner of Pat Head Summitt Street and Volunteer Boulevard in order to take part in a repainting of the Rock PERIOD

During the repainting on Wednesday the Rock was freshly coated in white a color that proved seasonally appropriate in the brisk morning PERIOD Chancellor Wayne Davis and Provost David Manderscheid were also present at the event PERIOD

The new canvas was not completely blank however in large spraypainted orange the Rock sported the phrase All Vols Belong All Vols Unite. this foundation was laid prior to the official event at least an hour before the painting representatives from the Chancellors Commissions for Blacks LGBT People and Women respectively were painting the bright orange declaration working through the steadily falling snowflakes PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Rachel Chen chair of the Chancellors Commission for Women opened the event introducing her associates including Sharon Couch chair of the Commission for Blacks PERIOD

As the event progressed attendees were encouraged to step up take a brush dip into any number of assorted paint colors and adorn the snowwhite Rock with colorful butterflies hearts and Power Ts PERIOD Before long all three covered the Rock PERIOD
