Every once in a while a movie emerges that shatters the romantic genre mold PERIOD It tweaks the triedandtrue formula with a bit of unorthodox experimentation PERIOD In the case of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind a vastly different scifiish angle was examined to create a work of art that is both memorable and sentimental PERIOD

At Quality  and Showcase  Screen Gems

Dear John is not one of those movies PERIOD When the smoke clears and all is said and done Dear John is a film that would probably do more harm than good to any relationship if one were to take that special someone to see it PERIOD

For starters the plot doesnt get any more timeworn than a young girl Amanda Seyfried Jennifers Body falling in love with a complete stranger Channing Tatum G.I PERIOD Joe The Rise of Cobra PERIOD The catch is that the couple has only a few weeks together before they must part ways  one going back to college the other back to life in the army PERIOD But before they separate both parties promise to stay in touch via written letters PERIOD

Seyfrieds character Savannah Curtis says writing to each other every day is like being together without being physically together  really heartbreaking stuff interrupted only by the minor realization that hundreds of movies have already exhausted this motif PERIOD Predictably the couples relationship is strained by distance and soon unforeseen events occur that threaten to drive the two apart forever PERIOD

But hey if the story is no good then at least the acting can pick up the slack PERIOD It should come as no surprise though that it really doesnt PERIOD Although the majority of the cast is passable one person in particular severely drops the ball PERIOD Armed with his extensive arsenal of one bad boy expression Tatum singlehandedly destroys what little redemption Dear John might have had PERIOD The expression of pain on his face during those tearjerker scenes is matched only by the pain on the viewers faces when they are forced to witness the man attempt acting PERIOD Its frustrating to keep guessing what exactly Tatum is trying to convey in his dialogue PERIOD

Whats even stranger is that Dear John is sort of reminiscent of Transformers . not to say the former is anywhere close to as flashy as the latter but what Transformers  was for many guys Dear John could be for many women PERIOD Hell it even has its own robot in the form of Channing Tatum PERIOD

Transformers director Michael Bay capitalized on every moment of Megan Fox screen time and the same can be said about Tatums role in Dear John. the opening scene for goodness sake centers on Tatum walking out of the surf in full beachbod mode PERIOD Any glaring shortfalls of the movie are cleverly covered up by an uncovered Tatum PERIOD

If Dear John were a letter it wouldnt be the sappy romantic type that makes ones heart flutter PERIOD Instead it would be the eviction notice telling you to get out before its too late PERIOD
