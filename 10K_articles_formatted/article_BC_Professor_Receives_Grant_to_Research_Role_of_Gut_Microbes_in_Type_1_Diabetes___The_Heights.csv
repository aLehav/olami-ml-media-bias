3669,2023-08-31,"the Beatson Foundation awarded assistant professor of biology Emrah Altindis a twoyear  grant to support his labs research on how gut microbes affect Type  diabetes PERIOD The grant is only awarded to five U.S PERIOD research teams each year PERIOD

We dont have so many satisfactions in life Altindis said PERIOD But getting this grant is something that makes you feel good about your research because some reviewers think that it is worth it to be supported. according to Altindis one of the main functions of the immune system is distinguishing what is self from what is not PERIOD A healthy immune system attacks foreign pathogens without hurting its own cells PERIOD If there is any dysregulation in the body the immune system begins to ambush its cells creating an autoimmune disease such as Type  diabetes PERIOD

So Type  diabetes is a chronic lifelong autoimmune disease that is mostly diagnosed during childhood or adolescence Altindis said PERIOD And once you have this disease you will have it for your whole life PERIOD  However we have no idea about the trigger of the disease. in  Altindis said he began to research whether gut microbes or gut microbiota could be a trigger for Type  diabetes as many people with autoimmune diseases have different types of gut bacteria from those who are not immunocompromised PERIOD

All living organisms are surrounded by different bacteria and are believed to have one kilogram of bacteria in their gut Altindis said PERIOD But those that are immunocompromised have a different gut composition compared to those with a healthy gut composition. according to Altindis his BC research team is exploring the root cause of why those with Type  diabetes have different types of gut microbes from those who do not have the disease PERIOD

But the question is is it egg or chicken Altindis said PERIOD Like do they have a different microbiota because they are sick or they get sick because they have a different gut microbiota

Altindiss lab is researching this question by isolating a protein called HPRT that exists within gut microbes PERIOD The researchers then give the HPRT protein to mice to see if they will develop Type  diabetes according to Audrey Randall GMCAS  who works in Altindiss lab PERIOD

If we produce this HPRTlike protein can we treat this isolated protein and give it to the mice and see if that in itself causes Type  diabetes Randall said PERIOD Then we can then confirm or understand if it plays a part in Type  diabetes autoimmunity. altindis expressed his gratitude to both the Beatson Foundation and his research team for supporting his work PERIOD

Im really grateful to everyone who contributed to this study  Im grateful for the people working in the lab and for their work Altindis said PERIOD And Im also grateful that we have had this foundations support PERIOD We also got two other grants for this project before. nEWS SPORTS ARTS MAGAZINE NEWTON OPINIONS MULTIMEDIA
