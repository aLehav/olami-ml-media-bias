Crocs are perhaps the most infamous fashion item of the decade PERIOD According to some fashion police you should be fined for even wearing them PERIOD

The past year was filled with several fashion trends that dominated college campuses PERIOD Though many of these trends were fleeting some of them lasted throughout the year PERIOD Its time to leave many of them in the past and hopefully make some new trends this year PERIOD

Jerseys over sweatshirts In  one of the most prominent trends was for guys to wear a sports jersey overtop a sweatshirt PERIOD There have been countless guys on campus sporting this trend in the past year but its about time this fashion statement is put to rest PERIOD Yes its an easy outfit to put on and walk out the door with but its just as easy to throw on a UC shirt before leaving the house PERIOD This trend reached its peak in  and it needs to stay there PERIOD Lets not aim for a comeback in  PERIOD

Half up half down bun hairdo One of the most popular hairstyles for girls and guys with long hair in  was the halfup halfdown bun  an odd style choice in which the wearer leaves half of their hair up in a messy bun and the rest down PERIOD Girls would wear this hair to class to parties bars formals  everywhere PERIOD Its time to discover a new easy hairstyle for whenever you are running late or have secondday hair PERIOD

Crocs Crocs made an arguably strong comeback in  PERIOD People claimed that they were the most practical shoe on the market water resistant comfortable colorful and versatile PERIOD Unfortunately the Crocs trend has come to an end PERIOD There are several other shoe options that are just as comfortable but are also practical and stylish  unlike Crocs PERIOD Yes theyre easy to put on and they give you that laidback look but lets agree to leave them in the closet this year PERIOD

Fur slidesjacketspompoms The fur trend took over throughout  PERIOD Almost every clothing store was selling fur slides jackets vests sweaters  you name it PERIOD Fur is not a new trend but it certainly blew up in  PERIOD Now its time to let the fur die PERIOD It was trendy for a short while but now its getting thrown onto everything PERIOD Along with fur  was the year of the pompoms PERIOD Last year pompoms were thrown onto everything ranging from shoes to keychains purses to clothes and everything else in between PERIOD Lets try to make  a furfree year or at the very least a pompom free year PERIOD
