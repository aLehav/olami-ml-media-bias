When Sakshi Srivastava junior in Engineering got an internship a classmate told her that she only received it because she is a woman PERIOD

That made me feel marginalized Women in engineering work just as hard as men in engineering do and sometimes even harder to overcome bias she said PERIOD

To counter this Srivastava has worked since last summer to solidify more support for women in engineering as . percent of engineering students on campus are female while around  percent of students on campus are female PERIOD

A male statute known as Grainger Bob sits on a bench outside of the Grainger Engineering Library however Srivastava believes he is missing a female counterpart PERIOD

She believes that a statue would show commitment to females in STEM fields and fosters campus unity PERIOD She hopes that students who visit campus will see the statue and recognize the belongingness for women PERIOD



The UrbanaChampaign Senate approved a proposal on Monday to show support for women in the College of Engineering PERIOD The proposal strives to maintain Chancellor Phyllis Wises strategic plan for  to promote a campus commitment to diversity by erecting a statue of one or more female engineers with care to include minority representation PERIOD

The senate recommended that the College of Engineering continues efforts to recruit and retain female minority and underrepresented groups of faculty and students PERIOD

The senate also recommended that College of Engineering Dean Andreas Cangellaris appoint a committee to recommend the selection of the statue its location and the artist who will create it as well as to secure funding sources PERIOD

In November Srivastava teamed with Illinois Student Senator Joshua Baalman sophomore in LAS to lobby the Illinois Student Senate to pass a similar resolution PERIOD

The UrbanaChampaign Senate proposal was submitted by Harry Hilton the chair of the Equal Opportunity and Inclusion committee who met with members within the College of Engineering to talk about the colleges hiring practices and enrollment procedures PERIOD

Baalman and Srivastava plan to begin working with the colleges Deans Office to secure funding PERIOD

What most people have debated is that we assume that just because the statute is up were going to increase the number of women in Engineering but that is not the case Baalman said PERIOD This is in addition to PERIOD All of the current practices whether it be affirmative action or inclusivity are taking place PERIOD This is another opportunity. he added that the University has a pool of funds for campus beautification some of which he hopes can go toward the statue PERIOD

This is a very good example of how even if youre just a student your voice is heard and can be heard Srivastava said PERIOD If it gets done there will always be a piece of my heart into the statue that would stay there forever PERIOD Its like leaving a part of me on this campus. megan can be reached at emailprotected and MeganAshJones PERIOD",U-C Senate approves proposal to erect female counterpart for ‘Grainger Bob’ - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
