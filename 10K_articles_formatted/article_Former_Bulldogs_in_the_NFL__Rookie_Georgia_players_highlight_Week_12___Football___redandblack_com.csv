Former Bulldog football stars were on display across the NFL this Thanksgiving week and it was the most recent Georgia products that had some of the best performances this week PERIOD The  Georgia rookie class has been one of the most impressive in recent memory and some of its absolute best players highlight our Week  roundup PERIOD

Michel exploded for a careerhigh  yards on the ground in New Englands  win over the New York Jets PERIOD Following a tough outing against the stingy Tennessee Titans run defense upon his return from a twoweek injury layoff the Patriots rookie running back bounced back at Metlife Stadium Sunday PERIOD Michel added a touchdown on  carries once again asserting himself as the bell cow back for Tom Brady and Bill Belichicks evergreen offense PERIOD Combined with the return of star tight end Rob Gronkowski this unit appears poised for a lateseason push before another seeminglyinevitable deep postseason run PERIOD

The Browns firstyear back was instrumental in Clevelands  victory over the Cincinnati Bengals the teams first road win since  PERIOD Chubb had  total touches for  yards and both a receiving and rushing touchdown with former Browns head coach Hue Jackson only able to watch from the opposing sideline PERIOD Clevelands offensive renaissance since Jackson and former offensive coordinator Todd Haley were fired has been remarkable with Chubb at the heart of one of the leagues more intriguing groups PERIOD Chubb and the Browns now face two difficult tests in the Carolina Panthers and Houston Texans both playoff contenders as  comes down the home stretch PERIOD

Smith was once again excellent as his surging Chicago Bears convincingly defeated the Lions  on Thanksgiving in Detroit PERIOD Despite missing starting quarterback Mitch Trubisky the Bears defense once again rose to the challenge holding former Georgia and current Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford without a touchdown pass for just the second time this season PERIOD Smith recorded  tackles leading all players on both sides in that category for the second consecutive week while also adding in a sack on Stafford PERIOD At the heart of arguably the NFLs best defense Smith has emerged as a rising star across the league and has a compelling case to already be one of if not Georgias absolute best defensive player in the NFL PERIOD
