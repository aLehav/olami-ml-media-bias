UMaines Student Newspaper since  PERIOD

In early November Maine citizens voted to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act PERIOD According to a New York Times election poll Maine is the first state in the country to solve the Medicaid question via a referendum PERIOD Though . percent of the state voted in favor of expansion of access Governor Paul LePage has stated that he will not implement the expansion PERIOD

As of midNovember LePage has vetoed Medicaid expansion bills five times PERIOD Finances are a major concern because the federal government will not fund it entirely PERIOD During the January session Maine legislators will have to create a new budget to cover the cost of Medicaid coverage for  people PERIOD A recent Politico article cited Maines health agency who said that by  expansion of Medicaid will likely cost the state  million PERIOD

Until  the federal government fronted the cost under the Affordable Care Act colloquially known as Obamacare PERIOD Over time however state governments will have to pay higher percentages of the cost starting with five percent and moving up incrementally to  percent over the next two years PERIOD Because of the high cost LePage is hesitant to implement the expansion even though the majority of Maine voters are in favor PERIOD

In January  the American Academy of Pediatrics released a report that said children make up . percent of Maines Medicaid population or  children PERIOD Medicaid costs just over  per child each year and just over  per adult PERIOD The report also highlighted the loss of federal funding for cutting state funding  for every  Maine removes from the state Medicaid budget it loses . in federal funds PERIOD

Most states according to the Kaiser Family Foundations annual Medicaid budget survey use general state funds to cover expansion costs and some tax health care providers PERIOD Maine has until fiscal year  to finalize state funding PERIOD

In  the Bangor Daily News published an article regarding the laws surrounding referendums PERIOD Referendums passed in November go into effect in January but the legislature can propose and vote on amendments after the fact PERIOD LePage has a history of altering referendums including last years marijuana legalization PERIOD Though there is pushback the state government legally can make changes PERIOD

However Maine has no laws regarding how soon an issue can appear on the ballot again so if a referendum is changed too much or is vetoed it can be voted on again the following year PERIOD While LePage has stated that he will not allow this to be implemented his vocal opposition to the expansion of Medicaid is currently based in financial considerations PERIOD It is likely that by the time the budget has to be finalized legislators fears will be quelled PERIOD
