Theres never a dull moment for the ClaremontMuddScripps mens tennis team   SCIAC.Between Mar PERIOD  and Mar PERIOD  the Stags played in seven matches finishing the nineday stretch with an impressive  record.Although they were handed their first two losses of the season to Emory University and Bowdoin College  in both matches the team has proven time and time again that its players have the composure and poise necessary to achieve greatness PERIOD

CMS had its first match on Friday Mar PERIOD  with a decisive  win over University ofTexasTyler in the StagHen Invitational Quarterfinals PERIOD Lester Yeh CM  set the tone for the matchin straight sets in the No. singles over Jose McIntyre  .CMS also faced intense competition against Trinity University   Conf. but ultimately took down the Tigers  on Saturday Mar PERIOD .That same day the Stags faced Emory   Conf. in a rematch of the  NCAA finals PERIOD The doubleheader proved too much for the Stags as Emory handed CMS its first loss of the season72 PERIOD

Though the Stags couldnt close out the win they view the match as a learning opportunityand a chance to improve for their next encounter with Emory later this season.We ended up losing to Emory but it ended up kind of being a good thing We learned what we needed to do to get better team captain Skyler Butts CM  said aboutthe match PERIOD

Although the loss came as a disappointment for CMS both Yeh and Avinash Vemuri CM  had thrilling wins in the No. and No. singles    and    respectively PERIOD Over the sevenmatch span Vemuri had an impressive  record PERIOD

In Vemurisfirst six matches playing for us he went on a tear.I attribute that to him being a very hard worker Butts said abouthis teammate PERIOD

CMS answered the loss to Emory with three straight wins The Stags triumphed  over Universtiy ofConnecticut on Thursday Mar PERIOD    Conf. defeatedWhitman College  later that day   Conf. and narrowly conquered Amherst College 54in a nailbiting matchon Saturday Mar PERIOD    Conf. pERIOD

Amherst particularly stood out to Butts as one of the most exciting matches of the season.The day started strong as No PERIOD 3doubles pair Glenn Hull CM  and Yeh took an  win over Zach Bessette and Ben Fife PERIOD No PERIOD 1pair Butts and Daniel Morkovine also defeated their opponents  to give the Stags twoof the three doubles wins PERIOD

At one point even though we took a doubles lead I thought we were going to lose because other than the top two courts everyone had lost up to that point Butts recalled.It got a little stressful but Maceycame through in singles.It was nice to get the win over Amherst its fun to beat the good schools. cMS jampacked schedule continues as the Stags host University ofChicago   Conf. and Chapman University   SCIAC Friday Mar PERIOD  PERIOD

Chicago is a really exciting team for uswe havent played them at least since Ive been here Butts said.Were excited because theyre one of the contenders for the national championship this yearand the next few years.Wed like to see how we stack up to them andmaybe use that experience to our advantage.The team also plays Williams College   Conf. wednesday Mar PERIOD  before taking on arch rival PomonaPitzer   SCIAC on Friday Apr PERIOD .As two of the best teams in SCIAC CMS holds the No. rank while PP is No PERIOD  Claremont should expect some good tennis from the Stags PERIOD
