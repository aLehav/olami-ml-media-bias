One of the best ways that we can do that is by getting kids educated right here in Iowa Wahls said PERIOD Underfunding our Regents universities is one of the favorite pastimes of Iowa Republicans PERIOD So not a surprise to me PERIOD And obviously its not going to solve the Reynolds workforce crisis. house Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst said that the states universities have been under attack by the legislature PERIOD
