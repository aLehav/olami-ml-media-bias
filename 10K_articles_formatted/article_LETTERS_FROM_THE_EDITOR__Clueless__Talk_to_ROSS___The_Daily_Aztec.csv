Blackboard is both a blessing and a curse PERIOD Its a blessing because  you can email everyone in the whole class if you have a question which  is really convenient PERIOD But its also a curse because everyone can  email the whole class if he or she has a question which is really  inconvenient PERIOD

Ever since midterms began my inbox has been peppered with inquiries equal parts desperate obvious and horrifically punctuated PERIOD

how do i do the assignment due 2moro im confused

where in the book does it talk about gene mutation

whats the answer  numb  on the takehome mid term

which scantron do i need  the test

Most  students dont abuse Blackboard in this way and only the most  oblivious students issue questions such as those showcased above PERIOD Ive  been here much longer than I should have so I can confirm that this has  been happening for years PERIOD But our classes are even more overenrolled  than usual and even the smaller lectures have an irritating ratio of  oblivious students PERIOD So on behalf of everyone else I am making a public  service announcement of the following guidelines PERIOD

Before you mass  email everyone in a desperate lastditch attempt to pass that scary  midterm please make sure you have done the following and thus not  wasted the rest of our time PERIOD

Captain Obvious suggests that confounded students

 PERIOD  Check with ROSS  short for Read Our Syllabus Stupid. hat tip Dr PERIOD  Hank Johnston of the sociology department. percent of the questions  flooding my inbox are answered on the syllabus PERIOD

 PERIOD  Come to class and be conscious  and not watching porn on your laptop   for at least  percent of the time PERIOD Enough to read what the professor  puts on the projector at least PERIOD Pause Netflix take a break from your  Facebook chat whatever you have to do PERIOD

 PERIOD In the absence of No PERIOD  open up the PowerPoint presentation your professor provides hit CtrlF AppleF for you Mac users and search for the term you want PERIOD See You dont even need to look through the whole PowerPoint PERIOD

 PERIOD  Flip through the assigned chapters in your textbook and read the  headings and bolded vocabulary terms PERIOD Yeah you should read the whole  thing but if you cant check out the bolded terms yourself you  shouldnt be in college PERIOD Actually if you refuse to read period you  probably shouldnt be in college PERIOD College is not made for reluctant  readers PERIOD

 PERIOD Or in the absence of No PERIOD  look in the index in the  back of the book PERIOD Which should be alphabetized and if youre not sure  how to use that you also probably shouldnt be in college PERIOD

 PERIOD Use  Wikipedia or Google PERIOD No youre not supposed to use the former for  research papers but theres no reason not to for studying PERIOD In fact  Ive found Wikipedia often has better explanations of the trickier  concepts professors cover than the professors themselves PERIOD Most of them  speak in professorese and arent fluent in undergraduate anymore. any  student who ignores these guidelines does so at his or her own peril PERIOD  Because its getting to the point where my irritation is very likely to  awaken my latent pyrokinetic  abilities and I dont want to be responsible for accidentally setting  clueless questioners on fire with my terrifying mind powers PERIOD

Of  course the students who need to know this information are not likely to  read this many words in a row anyway PERIOD But a girl can dream PERIOD

Ruthie Kelly is a journalism and political science superduper senior who will graduate when she feels like it thank you PERIOD
