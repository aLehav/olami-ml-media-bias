Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Ellen SkellyOctober  

More than  employers are recruiting NIU students through the Career Planning and Placement Center during the  academic year an increase of  percent over  PERIOD

In absolute numbers however student participation dropped from  last year to  this year almost  percent said Jean Callary campus recruiting coordinator PERIOD

The main reason for an increasing number of employers and a decreasing number of student participants Callary said is the abundance of available jobs in this area PERIOD

In effect students feel less panicked with a good job market she said PERIOD

Some of the  companies with new or expanded recruiting at CPPC are the Chicago Cubs Helene Curtis A.C PERIOD Nielsen and Dean Witter PERIOD

The NIU Alumni Association and CPPC Job Hunters Guide reports that over the years  to  percent of our graduates accept jobs within a few months after graduation. this includes both those who take jobs before and after graduating PERIOD

Recruiting is characterized by different types of companies in the spring and the fall Callary said PERIOD The trend in the fall is toward positions in fields related to majors in business and computer science PERIOD Spring recruiting concentrates more on liberal arts training for retailers or government PERIOD

Callary also said many companies recruit in both semesters and more recruiting is done during the spring semester PERIOD
