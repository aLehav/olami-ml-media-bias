Austin J PERIOD Yerington Arts Reporter September  

It may come as a surprise to current Hawkeye and Cyclone fans that the two teams havent always gone headtohead every football season but now Iowa and Iowa State fans alike can learn about the start of the rivalry series in the new documentary film Birth of the CyHawk PERIOD

The films director and producer Ben Godar an Iowa native grew up as a collegefootball fan and said he wanted to bring the CyHawk series origin story to fans PERIOD

I felt really steeped in the game and the history of the rivalry and I had no idea about this he said PERIOD

Before  the Hawkeyes and Cyclones had not played against each other for  years PERIOD The game returned following outcry from the two fanbases for the return of the rivalry games PERIOD A lawmaker also asked the two university presidents to create a series with both teams competing for the CyHawk trophy PERIOD

Godar said he learned of this origin story in the late 2000s from a childhood friend whose father was Bob Uetz one of the CyHawk trophys primary creators PERIOD

After learning of the trophys origins Godar said his fascination grew over the years and soon he brainstormed the idea for a documentary PERIOD Given his background in screenwriting Godar said he felt he needed to make this film PERIOD

The story of the film follows some fans and their reactions to the first Iowa State University and University of Iowa game since the 43year hiatus played for the simple walnut and brass CyHawk trophy PERIOD

Birth of the CyHawk has toured around the state since April PERIOD The film dbuted at Julien Dubuque Film Festival PERIOD It recently premiered in Ames and was shown Sept PERIOD  at FilmScene in Iowa City PERIOD

Its a very Iowa story FilmScene cofounder Andrew Sherburne said PERIOD You cant get much more Iowa than the Hawkeyes versus the Cyclones. assistant Athletics Director Steve Roe said the term rivalry is thrown around often but this particular rivalry should be enjoyed in good fun and with respect PERIOD

I think amongst the players and the coaches theres respect toward ISU Roe said PERIOD

Although the original CyHawk trophy was replaced in  Godar said he hopes to show the history that many Iowa fans never knew existed by premiering the film PERIOD

When they stopped using this trophy a piece of history was kind of lost there Godar said PERIOD It was a piece that wasnt very well known so I just want to make sure this story of these guys and ordinary fans are known by people. godar said the film has been a passion project PERIOD After years of interviews and production fans can now see their influence on the public PERIOD

This series would not have restarted if not for the fans they were really the ones that drove that Godar said PERIOD To me this trophy is such a perfect embodiment of that because the trophy itself also came from the fans. read Next
