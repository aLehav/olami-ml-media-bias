The UNO Nebraska Biomechanics Core Facility directed by Nicholas Stergiou was honored to host internationally distinguished neuroscientist Randolph Nudo at the Health Physical Education and Recreation building from noon until  p.m PERIOD on Dec PERIOD .Nudo director of the Landon Center on Aging and professor in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology at the University of Kansas Medical Center presented a lecture titled Brain Machine Interfaces for Modulating Recovery After Stroke. the lecture focused on the mechanisms responsible for brain function as well as the effects of rehabilitation training on brain function following a stroke PERIOD

The term stroke refers to the rapid loss of brain function as a result of inadequate blood supply to the brain PERIOD Inadequate blood supply can result from a blockage within the arteries of the brain or as a result of significant bleeding PERIOD

A common manifestation of stroke is the loss of motor skills PERIOD Recent research has been focused on studying the effects of different rehabilitation methods to restore brain function and motor skills in stroke patients PERIOD

At UNO Stergiou and the facility are currently exploring the use of rehabilitation robotics for sensorimotor training in affected upper limbs of stroke patients PERIOD

The lecture began with a historical introduction about the evolution and advancements made in understanding the mechanisms responsible for brain function PERIOD For two centuries neuroscientists have debated the theories of localization and plasticity with respect to describing brain function PERIOD

In  Spanish physician pathologist and Nobel laureate Santiago Ramn y Cajal proposed the theory of brain plasticity which refers to the lifelong ability of the human brain to reorganize neural pathways affected by internal and external experiences or stimuli PERIOD

Ramn y Cajal said the neurons produced during adulthood were plastic and had the ability to change their connections by adding or removing neuron connections PERIOD

Ultimately the theory of plasticity suggests the brain has the ability to change with learning PERIOD  This theory is critical to developing rehabilitative training following altered brain function as the result of stroke PERIOD

Before Ramn y Cajals hypothesis neuroscientists believed that in the adult brain the nerve paths are fixed and immutable Nudo said PERIOD

Everything can die nothing can be regenerated he said PERIOD

Such a finding suggests that following a stroke the brain has the ability to compensate for damaged tissue with nearby healthy tissue PERIOD

In the early 1900s American physiologist Shepherd Ivory Franz discovered that higher order functions such as learning and memory are not localized Nudo said PERIOD

Initially newly learned information is stored as shortterm memory PERIOD Under correct conditions neuron connectors can allow for information to be stored as longterm memory PERIOD

Franzs findings suggested memory is associated with neuronal alteration and further strengthened the argument of brain plasticity PERIOD In terms of stroke patients the proceeding question became how brain plasticity functions following a traumatic incident PERIOD

With respect to postinjury plasticity Franz reported that functional adaptation must exist in the brain allowing nonlesioned unaffected centers to take over according to Nudo PERIOD The precentral gyri which is also known as the primary motor cortex is located at the beginning of the primary motor pathway PERIOD The motor pathways are functionally responsible for gait posture reflexes muscle tone and the overall locomotive patterns of the motor system PERIOD

In  Franz performed a study involving serial destruction of bilateral precentral gyri in monkeys and confirmed the existence of what Nudo referred to as motor recovery after reeducation. thus by destroying the primary motor cortex Franz determined whether brain plasticity could result in motor recovery following trauma PERIOD

During the mid1960s French physician and anatomist Paul Broca first introduced the theory of localization after he found damage to the left frontal lobe was related with impaired speech PERIOD This localization of brain function theory Nudo explained suggests that different parts of the brain are responsible for different functions PERIOD

Currently Nudo said the universally excepted dogma for brain function is that functional localization is relative. physiological and anatomical plasticity is common in the adult cerebral cortex includes primary motor cortex he said PERIOD Evidence is building from preclinical and neuroimaging studies that vicarious function exists in the cerebral cortex after injury. nudo proceeded to discuss his current and previous research studies PERIOD  In previous endeavors Nudo discovered if a small stroke is induced by ligating or cutting arterial blood flow to a specific region of a monkeys motor cortex then specific regions adjacent to the ligated region have the ability to adapt and thus provide movement to the damaged portion of the body PERIOD

For example damage to portions of the motor cortex  which is responsible for ankle plantarflexion  might result in the inability to move the ankle PERIOD After rehabilitation other regions of the motor cortex adjacent to the damaged region have the ability to adapt and thus control the ankle plantarflexors in order to restore ankle movement PERIOD

Nudos current research is focused on exploring the changes that manifest in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex after a stroke PERIOD  The aim of his current research is to further understand the reorganization or plasticity process of the brain following traumatic incidences such as strokes PERIOD

Stergiou and Nudo have collaborated for several years in the exploration of analyzing various treatments to further enhance rehabilitation for stroke patients PERIOD
