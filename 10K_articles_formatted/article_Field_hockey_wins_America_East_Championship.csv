This entire season has been for us said senior attacker Corinne Zanolli in a postgame interview PERIOD Thats what we cheer at the beginning of the game and weve all bought into what we need to do to have us be successful and playing for each other. zanolli who sent the pass to Johnson for the decisive shot scored each of the first two goals for the Cardinal PERIOD Both scores came within the first ten minutes of the game and provided an early  lead for Stanford PERIOD

That onegoal margin held up for the next  minutes of game time before a late goal from Monmouths Colleen Craven tied the contest at two to send the game to overtime PERIOD Stanford was outshot during regulation time  but junior goalkeeper Hannah Santos held the Hawks to just the pair of scores to keep the team in the game PERIOD

Once in overtime the Cardinal offense took control PERIOD Over the two overtime periods Stanford generated seven shots compared to Monmouths one and had three penalty corners the last of which led to the eventual gamewinner PERIOD

When the team received the championship banner and customary school logo the team crossed out the Stanford S with black tape PERIOD Field hockey has been playing with Stanford crossed out on its jerseys for much of the regular season in continued protest of the universitys decision to cut the varsity program following this season PERIOD
