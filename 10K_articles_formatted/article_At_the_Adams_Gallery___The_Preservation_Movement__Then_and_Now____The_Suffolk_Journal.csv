Currently on display at the Adams Gallery located within the Law School is a fascinating culmination of historical locations being preserved throughout New England. the Preservation Movement Then and Now displays stories and pictures of historical settings in an attempt to motivate people to preserve our nations most historical sites PERIOD Spectators read stories of landmarks that have been saved and those that have not including stories of the people involved PERIOD

The display opens with anecdotal stories posted on the walls that demonstrate the importance of preservation PERIOD They offer stories such as the story of Hancock Mansion built by Thomas Hancock on Beacon Hill in . while Independence Hall and Mount Vernon are visited by thousands of spectators each year the Hancock Mansion no longer stands having been demolished in . the house was even occupied by Thomas Hancocks nephew John Hancock who became the first to sign the Declaration of Independence. in fact on his deathbed John Hancock requested the house be donated to the State of Massachusetts for the purpose of serving as the governors mansion but that wish was never granted. before it was decided that the house be destroyed attempts to carefully disassemble the house so that it could be rebuilt were abandoned PERIOD

Such stories are vital to the exhibit because they relay the tragedy of losing such important pieces of history and demonstrate the importance of preserving historical locations. ironically after the Hancock Mansion was destroyed its image appeared for years to follow including on dinner plates wall tiles and stamps. a replica of the house was built in  on Beacon St. where it stands to this day PERIOD

The exhibit also displays stories of sites that were saved by people who recognized their importance to history. the Old Meeting House a place where colonial Bostonians gathered to discuss the possibility of revolution and freedom from Great Britain was saved in  after serious attempts were made to tear it down. at the time it was almost 150yearsold PERIOD The Boston Tea Party was first planned at the building PERIOD

Another example is that of the Harral  Wheeler House in Bridgeport Connecticut which was saved in  after plans were made for its demolition. in fact the twentieth century marked an era of tremendous preservation and restoration throughout the United States including the restoration of colonial Williamsburg and the creation of the historic district in South Carolina. one of the displays on the wall depicted the biography of William Sumner Appleton who became the first American fulltime preservationist. he devoted a great deal of his career to saving many historic sites throughout the country and even gave up his own time and money to personally oversee the move and reconstruction of the Otis House in  PERIOD

The display discusses modern preservation and the efforts being made by both professional and volunteer preservationists. a wall screen shows various sites landscapes and objects that have been saved because of preservationist PERIOD These include houses cars and artifacts particularly those recovered from the Hancock Mansion PERIOD

The exhibit closes with a wall of pictures of the people contributed to preservation work. it is because of the efforts of these preservationists that historical locations and artifacts can be enjoyed today. the exhibit certainly captured the passion preservationists put into their work PERIOD The exhibit also offers a culmination of fascinating historical facts and anecdotes which are more than likely to fascinate any history buff. this display has proven to be not only educational but also entertaining to all PERIOD
