Organic for better or worse

Organic food may be downtoearth but it is still big
business PERIOD

According to the Organic Trade Association domestically
produced organic foods were a  billion industry in  with
organic fruits and vegetables making up . billion of that total PERIOD
Organics however only make up about  percent of the food market
though that fraction is steadily growing PERIOD

That growth can be attributed to the fact that the public is
becoming increasingly more conscious about food safety PERIOD Organic
farmers and producers have gone to great lengths to advertise the
wholesomeness of their products and with recalls surrounding
tomatoes jalapeos spinach and more recently peanuts and
pistachios wholesome is starting to look pretty good right about
now PERIOD

But that wholesomeness  resulting from farming methods that
dont rely on irradiation genetic modification or synthetic
herbicides pesticides fungicides or fertilizers  comes at a
price sometimes as high as double the price of what conventionally
grown products would sell for PERIOD Organic farming is after all more
labor and resource intensive and requires a good deal of time
before producers can be officially certified PERIOD

The organic foods industry has even begun a new marketing
campaign letting consumers know that organics are indeed worth
the extra cost PERIOD But whether they really give you the best value
depends a lot on where your priorities lie PERIOD

If youre concerned about food safety and avoiding foodborne
illness then organics may not be so much different than
conventionally farmed foods PERIOD Both are susceptible to contamination
from outside sources though organic farms implement buffer zones
to avoid contamination from neighboring facilities and wild
animals both of which could harbor salmonella and other pathogens PERIOD
Organic methods arent less effective at controlling pathogens
but then again they arent significantly more effective
either PERIOD

If ethical issues are your concern then organics might make you
feel good about the pollution your food is responsible for putting
into the environment PERIOD Nonorganic production methods on the other
hand have greater yields meaning that they can feed more people PERIOD
Genetically modified crops may not solve the problems of famine
stemming from ineffective distribution but encouraging African
nations like Zambia for example to accept rather than to deny
food aid that is GMO in origin would seem to be the more
responsible thing to do especially if the goal is in fact to feed
rather than to proselytize PERIOD

If the health of your family is of primary concern though one
could argue that it is better to have less pesticide on your food
and in your diet than it is to have more PERIOD Many families though
are having trouble with their budgets as it is in our struggling
economy PERIOD If families are being forced to choose between purity and
nutrition between the expensive organic option and the cheaper
conventional item that will allow them to buy school supplies or
diapers then that will be a decision consumers will have to make
in the grocery store PERIOD

As long as consumers have to make that difficult decision with
organic food fetching a premium it is likely that we will continue
to see organic food staying closer to  percent of the market than
 percent of it PERIOD
