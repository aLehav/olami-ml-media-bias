9939,2015-06-09,"thirty four percent of West Coast households own guns according to the Pew Research Center PERIOD Senior businuess administration major Beau Barker above owns four PERIOD Photo by Beau Barker PERIOD

For Joy Ellis guns were a normal part of her childhood PERIOD She tagged along on her father and brothers recreational hunting trips in Washington and her brother started hunting and shooting when he was in middle school PERIOD

When my brother thought Hillary Clinton was going to be elected he went out and spent around  on firearms because he thought his right was going to be taken away said Ellis a junior public relations and advertising major PERIOD

After a shooter killed  students in Parkland Florida Feb PERIOD  the gun control debate has resurfaced PERIOD In California about  percent of residents own a gun according to a  Columbia Universitystudy PERIOD Alaska and Arkansas have the highest rates of gun ownership with . percent and . percent respectively PERIOD

Though gun ownership isnt as common in California some Chapman students are accustomed to being around guns PERIOD

Ellis is not interested in owning a gun but she said that her parents encourage her to stay vigilant about gun safety PERIOD

I vividly remember my dad cleaning the gun and my mom saying this is a dangerous object and its not something to be played with Ellis said PERIOD That was always made clear as long as I can remember. ed Roth owner of Eds Gun Sales in Orange believes gun owners should be prepared to take on the responsibility of owning a weapon PERIOD

Eighteenyearolds buy Ducati motorcycles all the time PERIOD People buy all sorts of stuff that isnt safe Roth said PERIOD I kind of relate a fifth of whiskey to a gun  you can have fun or you can end up in a crash in an intersection. ellis grew up with an understanding of guns in both recreational and professional settings but she never considered gun control laws until the  Orlando nightclub shooting PERIOD

When Sandy Hook happened in  I think I was too young to realize that it was an issue and it was occuring more often Ellis said PERIOD I acknowledged that it was happening but I thought it was a rare occurrence PERIOD Recently Ive understood that it is a problem and it should be changed. ellis believes that the laws against owning a gun should be stricter within reason PERIOD

Right now if you want a gun to hunt or to protect yourself then why should you be scared to go through background checks and tests Ellis said PERIOD If people really want a gun and if they dont pass the qualifications they obviously shouldnt have one PERIOD You have to be mentally sane. though senior Beau Barkers father served in the Royal British Marines which gave him exposure to guns Barker didnt feel the need to have one until he moved to the U.S PERIOD Now he owns four PERIOD

Being Australian having a gun didnt seem necessary because gun control works over there even though we were raised with an understanding of guns said Barker a business administration major PERIOD I got one because it was a right offered to me and Id rather have one and never need it than need it and not have it. legislation should focus more on thorough background checks and less on weapon bans and the push to ban assault rifles is based on uneducated assumptions Barker said PERIOD

We need to have more checks on the mental health of people but the laws to comply to California standards dont prevent someone from buying a compliant gun and killing people. to obtain his guns Barker had to attend a gun laws and safety class and pass a certification PERIOD He also had to provide multiple forms of identification proof of residency criminal and mental health history and undergo a background check he said PERIOD

I wouldnt say that anyone can walk into a gun store and walk out with one PERIOD Its more complicated than that Barker said PERIOD

California requires background checks to purchase firearms but that doesnt mean owning a gun is for everyone Roth said

I do sell guns but I dont think everyone should own a gun Roth said PERIOD You never really know how youre going to feel until youre actually there. kali Hoffman contributed to this report PERIOD
