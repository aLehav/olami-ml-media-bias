ProPalestine proIsrael protestors clash at Tulane

Ben Shooter l Associate Arcade EditorFebruary  

Local indie record label Community Records is no stranger to going against the grain PERIOD Throughout its existence in a city dominated by brass bands and funk the label has helped carve out a scene for punk ska and dreampop music and popularize vinyl and cassettes in the age of digital downloads PERIOD To celebrate its eighth year of homegrown music the label is hosting two shows featuring local and touring bands this weekend at Hey Cafe PERIOD

Community Records may be a massive local fixture today but according to cofounder Daniel DRayRay the label began humbly as the small project of a few music marketing students at Loyola University New Orleans PERIOD

Basically it started with the first Community Records compilation with the idea of putting out a CD from our band and our friends bands around the country so that we could spread the word about all of our bands togetherRay said PERIOD From there it kind of just snowballed into putting out CDs for those bands more compilations and then eventually vinyl and the block party and everything. in its eight years Community Records has expanded to offer a number of opportunities for its bands PERIOD The label is known for its annual block party that showcases local music and also for its emphasis on physical format releases PERIOD Many of the bands that work with Community Records have the unique opportunity to release music on tapes and vinyl records in fact its arguable that the label is largely responsible for reigniting local interest in these formats PERIOD

Theres something nostalgic and it feels good to take that record out and put it on a turntable and have the artwork in such a huge 12by12 picture formatRay said PERIOD When the cassette thing started to happen a few years ago I was skeptical and didnt really get it because its not that great of an audio format PERIOD But then I found myself taking cassettes and putting them in the cassette player in the van or the cassette player that I have at the house. the shows this weekend boast lineups featuring relatively new talent like surfpunk rockers Gland but also Community Records mainstays like Pope Woozy and Rays own band All People PERIOD While All People does incorporate Rays trombone skills the showspervading sounds will be much grittier and more guitaroriented than most music one would expect from New Orleans PERIOD

That was a thought from the beginning to represent the whole underground scene from New Orleans because its overflowing with the funk and the jazz stuff and all that stuff is great and it comes from New OrleansRay said PERIOD But there is another scene here also that lends itself to its surroundings in New Orleans and its really unique. fridays lineup starts at  p.m PERIOD with local bands Gland and All People and Alabama group Black Hole Kids PERIOD Saturdays lineup also starting at  p.m. includes local bands Woozy and Pope Texas artists Chipper Jones and Chris Lopex and Pennsylvania band Scrap Kids PERIOD
