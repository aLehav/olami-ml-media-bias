The fire is still being investigated by the arson squad Northeastern Police and Northeasterns property insurance carrier Ferrier said PERIOD Because the investigation is ongoing Ferrier said he cannot comment on whether there are suspects in the case PERIOD

The investigation is continuing he said PERIOD There have been about three dozen people interviewed. samantha Sang a middler sociology and communications major was one of those called in for questioning PERIOD She said she doesnt know why she was called in but suspects it might be because she swiped into her residence hall after  a.m PERIOD Sunday PERIOD

They asked me what I was doing that day she said PERIOD It must have been when I swiped in because I wasnt anywhere in the area. ferrier said the fire department determined the cause of the fire was arson based on evidence at the scene eliminating accidental causes PERIOD

Physical evidence at the scene gave indications immediately once the fire was out and they could look at the site he said PERIOD There were early indicators that it was not electrical not accidental and thats how you get toward arson you rule out the causes that can start a fire by accident. this fire is not the first in Ell Hall PERIOD On Dec PERIOD   a fire destroyed the Bacon Memorial Chapel which was in the location that is now the Sacred Space PERIOD The Sacred Space was then created and was finished and dedicated in  Ferrier said PERIOD The fire occurred right before Christmas break and caused smoke damage to every floor PERIOD
