5366,2016-02-26,"when Kyle Korver nailed a three in  straight games over the course of two NBA seasons I honestly thought that record would stand forever PERIOD Korver is a useful player no question but he has basically one singular skill shooting threes and his entire subsistence in the NBA is predicated around that fact PERIOD Very few players have the green light to essentially chuck threes whenever they feel like it which is one half of the problem in chasing that record PERIOD The second Not many people can shoot like Korver PERIOD Its telling that Korvers streak more than doubles the best streaks of acclaimed threepoint artists like Ray Allen and Reggie Miller PERIOD

Well Im going to have to eat my thoughts because Stephen Curry just blew past Korver PERIOD And given Stephs game this streak may continue until he retires PERIOD

Few games exemplify the way Curry has weaponized the threepoint shot more than the Thursday afternoon matinee against the Orlando Magic PERIOD Through three quarters Curry scored  points on  shooting to go along with  rebounds and  assists PERIOD Of his FG attempts  came from behind the arc and an ungodly nine of them went in including a casual 44foot heave to close out the third PERIOD His  points came in just  minutes played an astonishing rate PERIOD Words cannot describe how easy this dude makes the threepoint shot look and at this rate defenders will have to start defending him at half court PERIOD As a fan on Twitter observed Currys shooting percentage from beyond  feet is better than Andrew Drummonds free throw shooting percentage PERIOD Ridiculous PERIOD

In the process of obliterating Korvers record Steph also pulled within  threes of breaking his own singleseason record for threes made PERIOD Again we are just five games removed from the AllStar break which roughly marks the midpoint of a season and Curry is ALREADY about to break a record that he set through a full 82game season PERIOD He might finish with  threesmade if this continues PERIOD In the machine that is the Golden State Warriors Curry is the dynamic cog that can singlehandedly warp reality PERIOD

The makers of the NBA 2K video game franchise said earlier this week that they cant seem to code for Currys brilliance PERIOD He makes silly shots seem reasonable impossible shots seem makeable and ludicrous shots seem casual PERIOD The ideal video game should seek to reward smartly taken shots and penalize poorly taken ones PERIOD In Stephland there is no such thing as a poor shot  hell if Steph decided to take only halfcourt shots all game Id let him do it  his return on investment is probably superior to many players post up games PERIOD

Curry is the reigning MVP of the league and barring a total catastrophe he should be the MVP again this season PERIOD He has already put himself in the conversation for alltime greats although he will need to keep performing at this level for many many years before that conversation can actually be meaningful PERIOD Golden State is the farandaway frontrunner to win the NBA title again this season and they might break the  Chicago Bulls regular season record of  wins if their pace holds up PERIOD The scary thing Currys game is not built on otherworldly athleticism or physical prowess PERIOD One could imagine a 45yearold Curry continuing to bomb threes as a spotup shooter  a frightening thought for the rest of the league PERIOD As it stands now much as Lob City was unmissable when it first took the league by storm Steph is heating up might be the new king of mustsee TV PERIOD

Long live King Steph  may his threepoint cup runneth over forever and a day PERIOD
