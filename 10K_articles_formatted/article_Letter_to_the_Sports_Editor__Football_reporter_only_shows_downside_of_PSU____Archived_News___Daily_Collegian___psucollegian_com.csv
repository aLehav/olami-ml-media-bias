Football reporter only shows downside of PSU

Football columnist Wade Malcolm is a pessimist PERIOD In his column in Mondays paper  Mon PERIOD Oct PERIOD  Malcolm laments how Penn State wont finish well this year will underachieve next year and do poorly in the years to come PERIOD How can he say that How can he write that The players read this stuff too and they can recognize it when they lack support PERIOD Have a little faith for petes sake We have young players making great contributions to the team PERIOD We had a great recruiting class last year and will probably do well again this year PERIOD And never ever ever doubt Coach Paterno Ever He knows what he is doing PERIOD The game hasnt past him by PERIOD He made be old but when Im that age I hope to maintain his sharpness and energy PERIOD The next two years will be good PERIOD We will do well PERIOD I know I said that about this year but being on campus seeing the games knowing what the players can do has me excited PERIOD Excited about the rest of this year and the years to come PERIOD

The coach isnt the problem the program isnt the problem it is naysayers like Malcolm who beat everyone on the football team down PERIOD

And when you write about something negative use the frowning photo not the grin PERIOD It makes your words hurt that much more PERIOD
