Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



This academic year welcomed a twosemester program that not only engages the English skills of international students but also exposes them to the American experience PERIOD

The Purdue community has long recognized the need for such a program PERIOD Purdue is second only to the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign for the largest international student population among public American universities PERIOD With last years firstever undergraduate English support classes Student Success at Purdue provided roots out of which the Purdue Language and Cultural Exchange PLaCE grew PERIOD

PLaCEs pilot period will run through the end of the academic year PERIOD The  international students will include those from the Exploratory Studies Program the College of Science and the Krannert School of Management PERIOD

Students will be introduced to American society with a humanitiesbased twist They will learn about art literature music pop culture and the global influence of English PERIOD

April Ginther the programs faculty adviser and director of Purdues Oral English Proficiency Program said to Purdue News that all these cultural components teach the critical thinking needed to succeed at Purdue and beyond. pLaCE has two primary objectives PERIOD First the program will better prepare international students for jobs after graduation with an emphasis on communicating well in a variety of social situations PERIOD Second PLaCE will bolster the internationaldomestic community in the spirit of the Universitys Purdue Moves initiatives PERIOD

Seven staff members for the PLaCE program plus two coordinators developed courses specifically to address students needs PERIOD All staff have experience with nonEnglish languages and have been trained extensively to teach English as a second language PERIOD

Many Purdue international students are from China so Purdues Chinese Language Program will partner with PLaCE as Purdue MIX Multinational Integration Xchange continues a separate but complementary program pairing international students with domestic students PERIOD

Ginther suggested a true international community is one in which many cultures are embraced and where a multilingual multicultural esprit de corps is welcomed and fostered PERIOD

The partner program is a step in this direction said Ginther PERIOD International students enrich Purdue with diversity of culture to campus and the University in turn is supporting them as they adapt to live and study abroad PERIOD

The expression practice makes perfect applies tenfold when it comes to learning a language PERIOD

The University Senate met on Monday to discuss the Purdue community and suggest improvements to the campus PERIOD
