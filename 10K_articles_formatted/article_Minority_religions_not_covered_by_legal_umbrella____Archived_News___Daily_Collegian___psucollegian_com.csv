The analysis by Finke and coauthor John Wybraniec a former doctoral student in sociology at Purdue University found minority religions are far less likely to be handed a favorable ruling in court PERIOD

The study also shows Christian and nonChristian minority religions are more likely to be involved in court cases than mainstream denominations and churches PERIOD

 Finke added PERIOD

Finke includes a variety of religions in his study from a wide range of religious faiths PERIOD Some of these denominations include Mormons Jehovahs Witnesses American Indian religions Muslims and Protestant sects such as the Assemblies of God PERIOD

Nondenominational or independent Christian churches Jews and Roman Catholics also have a poorer chance of being handed a favorable ruling said Finke when compared to more established Protestant churches PERIOD

Established faiths such as the Methodist Presbyterian and Episcopalian are more likely to have ruling come in their favor because they are more closely identified with those of the majority mainstream American society Finke added PERIOD

But Finke also noted new religions are becoming more prevalent within society PERIOD
