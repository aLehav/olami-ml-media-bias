This is in response to Matt Suedkamps iPhone review Apples iPhone Is Not All It Is Cracked Up To Be Daily Nexus Jan PERIOD  PERIOD Like most of his columns this one hinges on a number of speculative points that are misleading and laughable PERIOD He implies or asserts the following points that the interface of the phone will be similar to Mac OS X false that the touch screen is extremely sensitive and fragile  unlikely that its battery life is a mystery  entirely false and that its screens structural weakness will lead to  inevitable cracking  implausible PERIOD Solid refutations to his claims can be found with a little Googling PERIOD In a nod to balanced reporting perhaps he hopes that the iPhone may do for the phone market what the iPod did for the MP3 player market PERIOD Really In past articles Suedkamp has without irony assailed the iPod as some little Chinese slavelaborproduced piece of crap with crazy file restrictions and lack of functionality Microsoft Shows It Can Speak Apples Language Daily Nexus Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

I dont know what standards of credibility the Nexus purports to hold its columnists to but opinions arent worth publishing if theyre based on invented premises PERIOD Suedkamp demonstrates in his columns time and again that he is not familiar with the issues hes discussing and hed rather make inflammatory statements based on exaggerations than do enough research to write a wellinformed column PERIOD These types of people are known as trolls and their writings are known as flame bait PERIOD The tagline of the column reads Matt Suedkamp wants to smack that douche bag Mac guy in the face which seems to be the message of most of his columns to date PERIOD Cant the Nexus find any columnist interested in technology who can make informed opinions without a chip on his shoulder  I feel a little bit dumber every time I read what Suedkamp has to say PERIOD
