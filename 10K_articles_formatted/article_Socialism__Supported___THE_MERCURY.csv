from the rise and ultimate demise of global powers that once successfully ruled
under their own specific forms of government PERIOD Through these times the
perspective on the ideal choice of leadership has continuously changed PERIOD In
modern day society it surely seems to be widely accepted that democracy is an
unwavering sign of wealth by the people respect from the people and a system
that maintains the best interest for the people PERIOD Despite these things the
inherent flaw of humans has revealed defects within democracy that uprisings
and revolutions in the past have repeatedly struggled to end hunger unemployment
social inequality etc PERIOD Today the lack of healthcare and access to education
have also become significant problems PERIOD In order to overcome these flaws it is
important to understand the underlying ideology of the people the possible
way of fixing issues in the country through socialism a vital key to improving
the state of the nation and the increasing concern behind such a solution PERIOD

Of the greatest enemies to the current system were so quick to
defend as patriots in the U.S. communism has been repeatedly and strongly
condemned as an obstacle to the accessibility of freedom to the globe PERIOD While
communism does in fact keep individual citizens from climbing the
socioeconomic ladder for better opportunities  and has come to be universally
accepted as a failed form of government postCold War  a distinct quality of
democracy has also shown a similar failure PERIOD

With democracy comes a governmental structure that encourages financial
growth from the people that a government alone cant possibly control the
exact opposite of what communism in its time stood for PERIOD Capitalism an aspect
of a healthy democracy is defined as an arrangement where the economy 
business  is privatized and run by the citizens PERIOD This very setup while
promising contains the problematic possibility of spreading to other sectors
of a country PERIOD

Today capitalism in America influences two main aspects of a countrys
lifeline healthcare and education PERIOD According to NBC an estimated . million people . of the population went without health insurance in . furthermore the average cost of higher education  which is in many cases a
necessity in order to find a job that pays well today  increased  even when accounting for
inflation between  and  according to CNBC PERIOD As a countrys health and
its level of intellect impacts the quantity of financial gain to its citizens
as a whole both sectors should be as accessible as possible to everyone PERIOD After
all democracy itself calls for equal opportunity for everyone PERIOD It seems that
more often than not democracy now has become beneficial to only the top one
percent and a struggle to the rest PERIOD

In order to properly address this dilemma that affects millions
socializing and universalizing these very areas of necessity for the people
will prove to be beneficial in the long run PERIOD

Despite many countries that have progressed rather well in a democratic
socialist system  Norway and Finland for example  it is commonly mistaken
with the foundations of communism and rejected in the U.S PERIOD This misinformation
has become highly advantageous to many influential officials in Congress and
corporate owners as those in the government have passed tax cuts while
ignoring priorities such as healthcare PERIOD By socializing healthcare and
education we will provide greater access to aid as well as the ability to
excel in our personal careers PERIOD

Many may argue that socialized medicine and education is unfair PERIOD It may
seem that through socialization healthcare will according to The Federalist
an online conservative magazine result in shortages and long wait times
which means worse care PERIOD It is rife with inequality and inefficiency leading to
serious harm. however with universal aid people all over the country will
regardless have access to care and will not have to choose between living or
suffering in debt afterwards PERIOD One can also argue that by having free education
taxes will increase heavily but as more citizens are able to learn such a
drawback will be outweighed immensely by the fact that fulfilling basic needs
will allow us to focus on other aspects of society such as arts and sciences PERIOD

Therefore it is in our best interest to have free education and healthcare PERIOD Socialism of certain sectors in an overall democratic society is nothing to fear as the advantages are many and disadvantages few PERIOD These are necessities that all humans require and should never be considered as anything otherwise PERIOD
