Politics have changed PERIOD

Not just in the sense of how the government rolls out new policies and regulations or how leaders go about attempting to pass a bill but in how they address the public and appear in the eyes of the newest delegate in town social media PERIOD

Though social media was around for the  election it was nowhere near as popular as it is today PERIOD In an article for Bloomberg Businessweek Twitter Spokeswoman Rachael Horwitz said the  contest saw a total of . million tweets on the day of the election while today that many tweets are sent every six minutes PERIOD

Though not every one of those tweets has to do with this years election it still indicates a tremendous rise in the popularity of social media and campaigns are taking advantage of its powerful influence PERIOD

Both President Barack Obamas and the Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov PERIOD Mitt Romneys campaigns have already spent millions to advertise online PERIOD In fact according to the article in Businessweek the Romney campaign became the first ever to purchase a trending topic on Twitter last week which guaranteed his message would hold a prominent spot in the social networks news stream PERIOD

During Obamas speech Thursday after accepting the democratic nomination for president Twitter announced that a new record had been set PERIOD barackobama drove  tweets per minute and over nine million tweets were sent with the hashtag DNC2012. facebook has also garnered a significant following from the political masses PERIOD According to Andrew Noyes the websites manager of public policy and communication there are over  political Facebook pages in the United States as well as  pages for individual politicians he told Businessweek PERIOD

The Obama and Romney campaigns each have multiple pages on the website PERIOD As of Wednesday Obamas main Facebook page had over . million likes compared with Romneys . million PERIOD

Yet Chairman for the Centre County Republicans Daryl Schafer said he feels these numbers do not tell the whole tale PERIOD

I think that Obama sort of had a head start on his electronic campaign four years ago Schafer said PERIOD Though it wouldnt surprise me if the young voters who may be using this sort of media did identify with Obama more than they do with Mitt Romney PERIOD

Still Schafer said he still does not believe that the numbers can tell much about what is going to happen in November PERIOD

The Obama campaign also leads the way in the world of Twitter with just over . million followers PERIOD Romney has just over one million followers PERIOD

Despite the significant gap between numbers both are significant totals PERIOD Utilizing social media online lends both campaigns well over a million potential people that will consistently publicize and advertise every action of the campaign PERIOD

While all this scrutiny is not always positive in nature it still serves to get the masses talking which is essentially the ultimate goal of any campaign PERIOD

Nick Aquilante a member of Penn States Students for Obama campaign said this weight of social media will become more evident as the election draws closer PERIOD

I think the candidates will act more cautiously said Aquilante seniorpolitical science because they understand that what they do could almost immediately end up online. social media is also vastly changing how this election season is being reported by the news media PERIOD CNN said it plans to employ Facebook Twitter Instagram and FourSquare in their coverage of the election season as well as maintaining a live blog and an iReport page which will publish the best multimedia submissions they receive from the public PERIOD

This election may well be the first truly social election in U.S PERIOD history as a result the national conversation will play a bigger role than ever in the way news organizations cover the story Lila King of CNN wrote PERIOD

The widespread use of social media in politics is not without its criticisms however PERIOD Both campaigns have recently come under fire as some feel they have overstepped their bounds PERIOD

This particularly has occurred in the area of advertising on social media platforms PERIOD The online journal ProPublica reported on one case in which the online radio Pandora angered listeners when a message appeared on their screens asking them to share their email addresses in order to help Mitt Romney become the next president. in an email statement to ProPublica Pandora said that it could not comment on particular clients marketing strategies but that it offers campaigns both targeting for specific listeners based on favorite artist or type of music or by their age gender state county or congressional district PERIOD

However Penn State student Sarah Degrazia seniorhealth policy administration said she does not feel that campaigns should stop the employment of these advertising tactics just because it angers a few PERIOD

I know people that do get annoyed by these ads she said but I can see why the campaigns do itObviously it is a very effective way of going after younger voters as many of us are online far more than we are watching television. another point of annoyance in the campaign on social media is in the area of mobile apps PERIOD One particular application released by the Obama campaign at the end of July included a Google map that pinpointed nearby democratic households which any subscriber to the app can view PERIOD Each of these marked addresses displays the first name age and gender of the voter that lives at it PERIOD

This is explained in the applications licensing agreement which tells users that it may use information including but not limited to location PERIOD

After hearing about the app Penn State student Cole Lennon sophomore economics had mixed feelings PERIOD

In some ways I can see why some people might take issue with it Cole said but if you are willing to give that info away when you sign up for the app than you have to understand what form that info is out there in and how it is going to be used. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
