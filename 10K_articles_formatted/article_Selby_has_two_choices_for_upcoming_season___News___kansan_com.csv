Josh Selby is running out of time PERIOD

Not at Kansas PERIOD He can wait all year at Kansas PERIOD Hes got a full ride PERIOD Hes cleared to do everything but play in games PERIOD

But hes got another option PERIOD Selby is easily talented enough to make a living overseas for a year if he so chooses PERIOD Brandon Jennings the No PERIOD  recruit in the class of  already blazed that trail when he failed to make grades and signed on with an Italian team for a season PERIOD

All he did when he made it back stateside Dazzle the NBA world with one of the best opening months any rookie has ever had PERIOD He finished third in Rookie of the Year voting PERIOD

Heres what Selbys two choices entail

First he can stay at Kansas and risk the wrath of the NCAA PERIOD If they can find any wrongdoing on his behalf he could be out for the entire season PERIOD Hell still have a scholarship but he may never be able to play basketball at Kansas PERIOD

If hes cleared though Selby becomes an immediate rock star on campus not that he isnt already PERIOD He will undoubtedly be the starting point guard for the Jayhawks and he will more than likely be a star PERIOD

Fans will love him students will love him and hell get smiles everywhere he goes on campus PERIOD If the NBA cant reach a new collective bargaining agreement and locks out the players hell run the town for two years PERIOD

His second option involves infinitely less fanfare PERIOD Hell be just another face in the crowd in Europe PERIOD Jennings who blogged often during his Italian season constantly noted how he was not celebrated how he lived in a small apartment and how the pay was good but the lifestyle lacked the opulence of the American sports superstars PERIOD He averaged  minutes and . points per game off the bench far from being a star PERIOD

The punch line to both options is the same PERIOD Come May Selby becomes a lottery pick in the NBA draft signs a contract for millions of dollars and goes on to whatever success he may have in the league PERIOD Not such a bad life PERIOD

But Selbys in a rough spot right now PERIOD As former Jayhawk Paul Rudd classically put it in  though 

Bailing for Selby would be Europe PERIOD But Euroleague play is already underway and that window wont be open much longer PERIOD

Time to figure out what to do with those lemons Josh PERIOD
