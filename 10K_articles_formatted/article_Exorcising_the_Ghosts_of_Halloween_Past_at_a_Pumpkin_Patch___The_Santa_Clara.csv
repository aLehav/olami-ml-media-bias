dropcapIdropcaplast visited a pumpkin patch during a field trip in third grade PERIOD I still remember my teacher Mrs PERIOD Bradford whose bubblebespectacled eyes could spot trouble a mile away yelling at me in front of my whole class for climbing on a haystack PERIOD It was a mortifying moment and one that kept me from partaking in this fall tradition for over a decade PERIOD
But last week I made my triumphant return to not one but two pumpkin patches PERIOD
Both were owned and operated by ABC Tree Farms a seasonal conglomerate that also sells Christmas trees starting at the end of November PERIOD
One of their employees told me that ABC Tree Farms owns seventeen locations across the Bay Area and that during weekends it is nonstop craziness from open to close. luckily that was not the case when I met up with my caprisclad friend Forrest during a lazy and windy Tuesday afternoon PERIOD
The first patch we visited was on Benton Street where the only other people in attendance was a Raider Nation couple PERIOD
They looked at us with slight bewilderment which I took as confusion as to whether or not my male friend and I were in a romantic relationship we were after all two grown men at a pumpkin patch PERIOD I politely shook my head at them and they went on their way PERIOD
The Benton Street pumpkin patch offered inflatable slides pumpkinbased treats and haystacks that you could climb on without getting yelled at by your teacher PERIOD
Scarecrows and Halloween decorations adorned the grounds and immersed me in the autumn season just like that first sip of a Pumpkin Spice Latte what Im not made of stone PERIOD
After spending a half hour on Benton Street Forrest and I made our way over to the Monroe Street location PERIOD This one had a bit more foot traffic rambunctious kids fresh out of school and a bit more panache premature Christmas lights and a SpiderManthemed bouncy house PERIOD
The children ran around the patch and played on the slides while their parents sought out pumpkins for Jackolantern carving PERIOD
Forrest and I began our search for the perfect pumpkin to purchase personifying the various gourds PERIOD A group of small smooth pumpkins were school children PERIOD
A toppled over graycolored pumpkin was an elderly man in hospice PERIOD A flat reddish pumpkin was a pomegranate PERIOD Finally I found the one a small amber pumpkin lacking any marks or indentations PERIOD
It had been sitting by its self off to the side and for some reason reminded me of a young Haley Joel Osment PERIOD Haley was well worth the search and cost only a modest three dollars PERIOD
My bargain purchase was cause for celebration so we drove over to Athena Grill a Greek restaurant with a nationalized blue and white design PERIOD We both ordered Gyro plates piled high with spicy beef cool tzatziki soft pita bread herb french fries and a refreshing Greek salad PERIOD
We stayed at the restaurant about an hour longer than expected in order to fully digest the massive Mediterranean meal PERIOD
It began to get dark so Forrest dropped Haley and I off for the evening PERIOD I carried the pumpkin home with me thinking about the purity of pumpkin patches PERIOD
Halloween has been corrupted by overeating candy wearing scanty costumes and drinking until we convince ourselves that The Blair Witch Project was actually a good movie PERIOD
Similar to Christmas and Easter we have lost much of the purpose and tradition of the holiday PERIOD
Pumpkin patches on the other hand are peaceful refuges from delinquency PERIOD
Theyre inviting affordable and a hell of a lot less pretentious than other commercially delicious traditions looking at you pumpkin spice latte PERIOD
They display the autumns colorful transformation and fill any visitor with nostalgia for the years when Halloween was less horny tacky and boozy PERIOD
Dont wait ten years like I did PERIOD Go to a pumpkin patch climb the formerly forbidden haystack and find your own Haley PERIOD
