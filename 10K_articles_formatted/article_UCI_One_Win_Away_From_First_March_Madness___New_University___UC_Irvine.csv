For the first time since  the UC Irvine mens basketball team is headed to the Big West Conference Championship game which will take place at the Honda Center in Anaheim on Saturday March  at  p.m PERIOD The No PERIOD  seeded Anteaters will face No PERIOD  Pacific PERIOD Not since  has a No PERIOD  seed Long Beach State won the Big West Tournament PERIOD

Last year UC Irvine started four juniors and a sophomore against a veteran Long Beach State roster in the semifinals of the conference tournament PERIOD On Friday night UC Irvine didnt need their veterans to get quite possibly the biggest win in the history of the mens basketball Black  Blue Rivalry PERIOD

With twotime Big West Hustle Award recipient Adam Folker on the sidelines the Anteaters resorted to a small lineup that they hadnt played with in a years time PERIOD Folker was fully suited up but his right leg was heavily bandaged PERIOD As he jogged onto the court for warmups he did so gingerly PERIOD Since December all hes been talking about is winning the Big West Championship PERIOD Humbling to say the least UCI had to defeat Long Beach without their stabilizing presence in the paint their emotional leader PERIOD

Senior small forward Mike Wilder was swapped to the power forward position PERIOD At sixfoottwo inches Wilder struggled to find shots on the offensive end but held his own on defense PERIOD At shooting guard Daman Starring was smothered by Long Beach on Friday night PERIOD He started  from the field and only had two points in the first half PERIOD Starring finished strong though with seven points and seven assists PERIOD

Sophomore Fresno State transfer John Ryan tried to fill in as best as he could in the paint for Folker scoring two points in  minutes PERIOD

To win UCI had to play small PERIOD So that left the game in the hands of a junior a sophomore and a freshman and boy did we see a glimpse into the future of the Anteaters PERIOD

Chris McNealy the junior started in place of Folker totaling  points and seven rebounds PERIOD

Will Davis II the sophomore brought an abundance of energy that the team needed given Folkers absence PERIOD With a twopoint lead and less than two minutes to go Davis swatted a ball two rows deep into the crowd PERIOD It was all the momentum UCI needed PERIOD Davis finished with  points nine rebounds and three blocks PERIOD

Alex Young the freshman played as if he was facing a high school basketball team PERIOD He was poised he was smart and he was the leader PERIOD With Starring equalized the Anteaters needed someone to step up on the offensive end PERIOD It wasnt Wilder like it had been so often over the past three years it was Young PERIOD



First Half

The game started with a showdown that pitted Young against junior Kaela King of Long Beach PERIOD Young scored the games first five points drilling a threepointer and then sinking a lobbed shot while running through the lane PERIOD But King answered PERIOD The Arizona State transfer hit a layup of his own followed by a threepointer right after the first timeout of the game PERIOD Young  King  PERIOD

Tied at  Young and King each had seven apiece PERIOD Young would finish with a gamehigh  points on  shooting while hitting all six of his freethrow attempts PERIOD He also added four assists and only committed one turnover PERIOD

The story of the game is about turnovers PERIOD We didnt turn it over PERIOD If you dont turn it over Long Beach doesnt run UCI head coach Russell Turner said PERIOD

UCI finished with seven turnovers compared to the 49ers  PERIOD

King finished with  points and eight rebounds for the 49ers playing  of the games  minutes PERIOD

With the Anteaters up  McNealy hit a jumpshot to extend the lead to four PERIOD He then swiped the ball away from a Long Beach opponent at halfcourt and ran unscathed to the basket pushing off with two feet to throw down an emphatic dunk PERIOD Timeout Long Beach PERIOD

The 49ers came out of the timeout shooting PERIOD King sank a jumper and within  seconds forward Tony Freeland scored in the paint and drew a foul PERIOD Freeland made his foul shot to put Long Beach up  PERIOD

On the other end sophomore Travis Souza buried a threepointer with  seconds remaining in the first half putting UCI up  PERIOD

The Anteaters then got the ball back as Starring looked to make his presence felt prior to halftime PERIOD Starring dribbled into the paint and then tried to kick a pass to Wilder but it was deflected to the other side of halfcourt PERIOD Starring retrieved the ball with two defenders surrounding him took a few steps past halfcourt and heaved up a long threepointer PERIOD Just as the ball left his hands the buzzer sounded and the shot went in PERIOD

Both teams headed to the locker room as the referees reviewed the play PERIOD After about five minutes of deliberation the refs determined that the ball was still in Starrings hand when the shotclock went off leaving . seconds on the game clock PERIOD

In a rare sight both teams returned from the locker room for one final inbounds pass PERIOD Coach Turner put UCIs alltime singleseason blocks champ Davis in to guard the passer PERIOD Davis tipped the pass starting and ending the clock before Long Beach could get a shot off PERIOD The two teams headed back to the locker room with Irvine leading  PERIOD

The refs told me it really wasnt that close Turner said of Starrings threepointer at the buzzer PERIOD

I think Daman was only concerned with his shooting percentage the coach said chuckling PERIOD



Second Half

To start the second half Long Beach scored four unanswered points off of a freethrow by forward Dan Jennings and then a threepointer from Big West Player of the Year James Ennis who would become one of the biggest stories of the game PERIOD Just as the Anteaters had to deal with Folker on their bench Long Beach had to manage with Ennis in foul trouble PERIOD

Down  Davis was fouled and made his layup PERIOD He then sank the freethrow to tie it up at  PERIOD Ennis then hit another threepointer for Long Beach PERIOD Sophomore guard Mike Caffey who had been quiet on the offensive end all night then made a long twopointer to extend the 49ers lead to five PERIOD But once again Davis dropped two more points in the paint for the Eaters PERIOD

Freeland finished off the scoring frenzy for Long Beach forcing Turner to take a timeout as the Anteaters saw their halftime lead slip and now trailed  with  remaining PERIOD Just as the Beach began to heat up Ennis committed his fourth foul coming one away from fouling out with more than  minutes to play PERIOD

With  remaining in the game UCI was riding a scoring drought that had gone for more than five minutes when McNealy hit a threepointer just in front of the UCI bench PERIOD

Young later drove frantically to the basket was tripped and tossed the ball high off the glass as he dove to the floor PERIOD The ball rattled around for a couple of seconds and then broke through the net PERIOD Long Beach led  with  remaining PERIOD

Jennings banked a shot off the glass to give Long Beach a  lead with  to play but was answered by another clutch threepointer by Irvine sharpshooter Travis Souza PERIOD

The two teams then traded four straight baskets starting with a wellcontested layup for Caffey of Long Beach then a threepointer for Wilder of Irvine then another field goal for Caffey and after a Starring miss Davis tipped the rebound in to cut the deficit to two PERIOD Coach Turner strategically ended the frenzy with a timeout after his teams basket PERIOD Long Beach  UC Irvine   left on the clock PERIOD

One minute later Young hit a clutch threepointer to give UCI their first lead in about  minutes of play  PERIOD Then on the defensive end Davis rejected a shot like Dikembe Mutombo in a Geiko commercial PERIOD Davis and the UCI crowd erupted with emotion PERIOD

Leading  Young skied for a rebound on the defensive end PERIOD A whistle blew PERIOD A foul called PERIOD James Ennis the conference player of the year was whistled for going over Youngs back for the rebound and fouls out PERIOD Ennis finished with  points and three rebounds in  minutes PERIOD Had he not been in foul trouble the game would likely have played out much differently as Ennis was unable to play aggressively on the boards PERIOD

After the game Ennis stared into the ground throughout the majority of the press conference PERIOD

Im just down on myself because I let my teammates down he said PERIOD

Long Beach coach Dan Monson jumped in with one of the classier quotes of the entire tournament stating Were here because of Ennis PERIOD Hes the most valuable player of this league PERIOD You win as a team and you lose as a team PERIOD He wanted it so bad today that he got into foul trouble PERIOD If the only thing he did wrong today is get into foul trouble well live with that. up  Davis had no Ennis to bother him in the paint PERIOD Starring cut to the basket and dropped a pass into Davis hands PERIOD The sophomore forward slammed an emphatic dunk home putting the game out of reach PERIOD With . seconds on the clock UCI forced a turnover and Young was sent to the freethrow line to add his seventeenth and eighteenth points of the evening. capping off a  run when it mattered most UCI defeated Long Beach  PERIOD

After the game Coach Turner shook hands with Monson the Big West Coach of the Year and his team PERIOD He then proceeded to the crowd to kiss his son  Darius  in the front row highfive fans and throw up a zot sign PERIOD

UC Irvine is now just  minutes away from qualifying for their first NCAA Tournament in school history PERIOD

I couldnt be prouder of the effort my team put forth Turner said PERIOD

Turner believes in his freshman point guard so much so that he started Young over senior Derick Flowers in December PERIOD Young played like a veteran on Friday evening and spoke like one too PERIOD

Were  minutes away from the tournament but tomorrow anything could happen Young said PERIOD Its going to come down to defense. when asked who hed like to face in the championship game before Cal Poly and Pacific got under way Turner said I hope they both lose. while comical Turner may be right PERIOD Cal Poly lost on Friday night and Pacific might be next on Saturday evening PERIOD

The Pacific Tigers eked out a buzzerbeating tipin to send Cal Poly packing late Friday evening PERIOD UCI assistant coaches Ali Ton and Nick Booker were courtside doing their homework as the rest of the team rested up for Saturday night PERIOD

The win over Long Beach gives UC Irvine  wins which is the most the program has had since the  season PERIOD Last year the Anteaters won  games PERIOD They have now won eight of their last nine games PERIOD



Big West Championship Preview



UCI  and Pacific  split their season series PERIOD Irvine lost at Pacific one week ago  and defeated the Tigers at the Bren Events Center in Irvine on Feb PERIOD   PERIOD In front of an Orange County crowd in  UC Irvine is  with their lone loss coming at the Bren against LSU on Dec PERIOD  PERIOD

Pacific pulled out a defensive battle on Friday night against Cal Poly PERIOD Junior Tony Gill who gave the Tigers  points on  shooting led the way PERIOD With the game tied and less than  seconds left against Cal Poly junior guard Lorenzo McCloud took a fadeaway jumpshot for the win PERIOD The shot missed but was gathered by senior forward Travis Fulton in the paint PERIOD Fulton tipped it in with . seconds remaining on the clock giving Pacific the  win over Cal Poly PERIOD

The Anteaters arent the only team in the tournament with heroics on their side PERIOD Coach Russell Turner hopes to make his first trip to the NCAA Tournament as a head coach but Pacific Coach Bob Thomason hopes to end his career in the tournament PERIOD Thomason is retiring at seasons end PERIOD

Will Folker play on Saturday evening Well see PERIOD Playing on hardwood that is laid over the ice at the Honda Center itd be fitting for the Canadian center who spent years dribbling a frozen ball in the winters of Markham Ontario to finish his Big West career off with a meaningful contribution to the team he has been boasting about for months PERIOD After a long recovery from hip surgery Folkers experience is key but he might be a liability playing hurt PERIOD

I thought about bringing Folker in when we were down to give the team an emotional lift Turner admitted of the Long Beach game PERIOD

Folkers status is still probable but without a doubt hell be suited up PERIOD

So many storylines are in place as the No PERIOD  Pacific Tigers face No PERIOD  UC Irvine tonight at  p.m PERIOD at the Honda Center in Anaheim PERIOD

Will this be the last game of Daman Starring Mike Wilder Adam Folker and Derick Flowers collegiate careers Will Folker play with a heavily bandaged leg Will the Anteaters advance to their first NCAA Tournament in school history Will Bob Thomason go out with a loss in the Big West Tournament or will he advance to the NCAA Tournament So many questions to be answered  BE THERE
