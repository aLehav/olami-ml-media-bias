To all new students both undergrads and grads Gather your purses and wallets PERIOD This is not a To all new students both undergrads and grads Gather your purses and wallets PERIOD This is not a drill PERIOD

Youre about to reshape the land make opportunities for some break them for others and cause significant sociocultural change right here in Pittsburgh PERIOD People less keen on the dramatic might describe your task differently Youre going shopping PERIOD

Whichever words you end up choosing the amount of spending youre sure to do here over your academic career starting today amounts to some serious cash PERIOD

According to a Pitt study Pitt students in  injected more than  million into the local economy PERIOD Thats more than half of what the entire city gets in yearly revenue PERIOD The typical college is supposed to teach you the power of the pen of dedication and of creativity among other things  but at Pitt be wary of the tremendous power residing in your wallet PERIOD

From retail stores to pizza shops to local charity organizations your dollars will decide what lives and dies in Oaklands commercial jungle in the years ahead PERIOD Spending is one of the most direct forms of community involvement and your purse exercises at least as much power over local issues as does your ballot if not more PERIOD

So while Oakland residents might see the beginning of fall as a flood of rowdy young folks preparing to tear up the town in a swamp of drunken debauchery the local businesses of Oakland see the last week of August and the first weeks of September as cause for joyous celebration PERIOD Its Christmas time for Oakland businesses and you guessed it in this holiday production you play the redcoated fat man with the sack full of dollars PERIOD

And they just cant wait to have you climbing down their chimneys PERIOD Pittsburgh companies are itching to clothe you in their tight jeans and their intelligent bras to nourish you with their humane hamburgers and their novelty drinks and to zip you around in their paypertrip automobiles PERIOD In Pittsburgh the customer is always right but the student is even righter PERIOD

They treat you well because they know how much power you have PERIOD

We wont holler at you that great power implies great responsibility PERIOD Well just say it politely and with the greatest affection PERIOD Because its true PERIOD

Before you ask a business if it takes Panther Funds you should be asking if its acting as you think a business should if it delivers goods and services in ways that coincide with the society that you want PERIOD An informed consumer is an active citizen PERIOD

For however long you plan to stay be conscious of your impact on this city PERIOD We assure you the impact will be made with or without your consent PERIOD In two years or four or six or whenever your academic pursuits take you away from Pittsburgh our community will look and feel very different from the way it does now PERIOD And the change will be in a large part your legacy PERIOD

So come on be a conscious Santa Claus Choose your gift. pERIOD
