The Worse Things Get The Harder I Fight The Harder I Fight The More I Love You

Grade B

Sounds Like A musician rising above her depression

Between 2009s Middle Cyclone and her latest fulllength album The Worse Things Get The Harder I Fight The Harder I Fight The More I Love You Neko Case sunk into a crippling depression PERIOD After losing her grandmother and both parents in a short period of time Case reached a distant and challenging creative period PERIOD She claims to hardly even remember writing many of the songs written during this time PERIOD

These songs eventually became her excellent sixth studio album PERIOD Daring as ever Case continues to brazenly carve up gender expectations with her trademark razorsharp wit and frankness but she also turns in the most introspective work of her career PERIOD

Whether she fully recalls its conception or not The Worse Things Get soundtracks this decidedly dark time in Cases life and makes for some of her most reflective lyrics PERIOD But the music itself does little to create a moody or brooding experience PERIOD

Far removed from her days as a countrywestern artist Case all but abandons the twang for a convincing blend of powerpop folkrock and midtempo ballads PERIOD Most songs on The Worse Things Get sound as mainstream and familiar as anything Case has released to this point but they are delivered with a booming conviction and a cutting wit that are unmistakably hers PERIOD

In a recent interview with The Guardian Case was especially vocal about her problems with the current feminist movements focus Dont stop here and fight about why youre calling yourself a feminist or not PERIOD Because the women who marched and fought so we could vote they didnt do it so we could sit around bickering about what we called ourselves. case mirrors that sentiment on the album with declarations like Im a mans man Ive always been  You deal with me directly from the new albums lead single Man. powered by a throttling lead guitar line from M PERIOD Ward it stands out among Cases most aggressive statements to date PERIOD

Instead of simply pining to be one of the boys she wants to show the boys how to be men  even if it means kicking their asses in the process PERIOD On the track following Man the acoustic Im From Nowhere she tactfully grapples with her previous bold assertion singing I was surprised when you called me a lady cause Im still not sure thats what I wanna be. when shes not crusading against gender norms Case turns inward for compelling commentary on heartbreak depression and getting a handle on life itself PERIOD On early album highlight Night Still Comes Case pleads again and again You never held it at the right angle. the it is seemingly irrelevant  she just seems desperate for a tighter grasp on things PERIOD Some songs are downright romantic but Case manages to transcend sappy sentiment PERIOD Calling Cards and Local Girl commiserate the toll that years of heartbreak and distance can take while shamelessly longing for the one that got away PERIOD



The Worse Things Get is at its most conceptually daring when Case recalls an exchange she witnessed between a mother and her daughter in a Hawaii airport PERIOD Performed entirely a cappella and lathered in reverb Case transcribes the mothers scathing dialogue directly Get the fck away from me why dont you ever shut up Given Cases tenuous relationship with her mother this scene resonated strongly with her PERIOD Its the albums most chilling moment and it strives to replicate the impact the mothers words would have on her childs life PERIOD

Most impressively none of the thematic risks or conceptually challenging material ever weighs down songcraft on The Worse Things Get PERIOD Despite going through a rough patch Case didnt soften her approach PERIOD Instead she confidently tightened it PERIOD With her stirring conviction one might believe that she could make it through anything PERIOD
