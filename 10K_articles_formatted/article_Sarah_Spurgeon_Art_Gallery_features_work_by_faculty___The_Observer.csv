Shane Johnson right discussing his piece Gallery of the Gamer Overwatch Tournament. megan Rogers Senior ReporterNovember  

 pounds of solid ice filled the Sarah Spurgeon Art Gallery in Randall Hall for the Department of Art and Design Faculty Exhibition on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD The gallery features the recent work of fulltime and parttime faculty members graduate teaching assistants and retired faculty members from CWU PERIOD

One piece that will be shown is Thaw created by the Art and Design Department Chair Gregg Schlanger PERIOD

Its the ice been placed in a pool and its going to gradually fall over the course of the exhibit Gallery Director Heather Horn Johnson said PERIOD

Horn Johnson said this show is a good opportunity for students who are either currently taking or may want to take an art and design class to see what new ideas their professors are working on PERIOD

Schlanger said he has never done anything like Thaw before PERIOD

I use ice because I think its very seductive of a material Schlanger said PERIOD I had no idea that it was going to glow blue like glacier under these lights until yesterday  It was a happy surprise. schlanger said he hopes the piece is simple enough to allow people to bring themselves to it and think what they want to think about it PERIOD S Moss a CWU alum said that Thaw gives them feelings of disconnect between body and mind PERIOD

My show solo exhibition at CWU was focused on things of being trans seeing my body and my gender as a shifting identity and I totally see that here Moss said PERIOD I dont think photos would do this piece justice because I think the movement of everything is so important PERIOD Nothings going up towards the houses everythings coming down. charlie Tadlock a graduate assistant at CWU had a piece in the exhibition called An Hour and a Half Home which is a timelapse of him driving back home to the west side of Washington PERIOD

Tadlock said he just let a sense of unconsciousness come over him with the timelapsed images of himself PERIOD

Theres points where Im dancing along to the music in the car and theres a point where I stop and get out and stretch and sort of letting that kind of monotony and banality of the road come through Tadlock said PERIOD

Tadlock said with this piece he hopes people will consider their own presence as they go through landscapes PERIOD

I would like it if people thought about the next time theyre out driving What are these sort of iconic symbols How are they sort of fading in and out of this sense of sort of highway hypnosis Tadlock said PERIOD

Shane Johnson a faculty member had two pieces in the show Gallery of the Gamer Overwatch Tournament and Gallery of the Gamer World of Warcraft. these two pieces were a part of a job that I did for Activision Blizzard Media Johnson said PERIOD They contracted with a marketing agency that I work with and they wanted to create an online virtual gallery featuring different artworks or adaptations of artworks that reflected different aspects of gaming and gamer culture. van Parsons a junior studying art at CWU said their favorite piece was Gallery of the Gamer Overwatch Tournament. that is just like the peak epitome of like Oh my God I want to do that Parsons said PERIOD Its such a great thing to see it in a gallery setting PERIOD You dont usually see it. the Department of Art and Design Faculty Exhibition will be in the Sarah Spurgeon Art Gallery until Dec PERIOD  PERIOD The gallery is free and open weekdays from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD and Saturdays from  p.m PERIOD
