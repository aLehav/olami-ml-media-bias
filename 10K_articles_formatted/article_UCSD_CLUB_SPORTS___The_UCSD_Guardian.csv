In only its second year as a club sport at UCSD the badminton club team established itself as a force in more than the world of collegiate badminton PERIOD

This season saw UCSD end its year in a firstplace tie with cochampion UC Irvine with both schools finishing with a  record PERIOD The two teams share the title but UC Irvine has a higher seed than UCSD based on the strength of Irvines sweep in the badminton postseason tournament PERIOD UCSDs attempt to steal the crown from UC Irvine fell short this year but UCSD is pleased with the improvement PERIOD

Last year UCSD tied for first with UC Irvine and UCLA but the disorganization and informality of the newly formed league cast doubt on its placement PERIOD This year in the midst of a more organized league UCSD again found itself legitimately at the top with no questions as to the veracity of its standing PERIOD

A large part of UCSDs success this year came courtesy of Dede Davis who earned the most match and team points of any other UCSD badminton athlete this year PERIOD

The team also attributes much of its improved performance to the addition of coach Mike Walker PERIOD Not only has Walker worked on improving the UCSD athletes technique he has also attracted a much broader base of student interest by turning the team into a much more official and professionally run organization PERIOD

As badmintons popularity begins to spread across the West Coast UCSD hopes to see an allstate championships organized by next season PERIOD

WATERSKI



The UCSD waterski team finished its  campaign with five tournament wins four secondplace finishes and one fourthplace finish PERIOD However the sole fourthplace finish came at the worst time when UCSD was foiled by champions Arizona State in the regionals and ended just one spot short of traveling to the nationals while the top three teams in the regionals advance PERIOD On the womens waterski side UCSD missed nationals by just one skier showing how close UCSD came to advancing PERIOD

Senior Tom Stout led UCSD with a phenomenal senior year and was an integral part of UCSDs high rankings PERIOD His most notable accomplishment was his demolishing of the UCSD waterski jump record with a jump of  feet PERIOD

The team also managed to qualify three skiers for the Western Region AllStar team in addition to taking first place at the UC Santa Barbara Paradise Cup for the second year in a row PERIOD

Both the mens and the womens teams will be seeking strong performances from their underclassmen in the upcoming year to retain the glimpses of the promising future UCSD showed this year PERIOD

Sophomores Tim ODell and Steve Simpson stepped up this season and their performances show that the loss of five seniors from the team may not spell disaster next season PERIOD

Sophomore Katie Ambrose looks to shine next year for the womens squad after posting a solid waterski competition across the board by placing in the top five in all but one tournament this year PERIOD

COMPETITION DANCE



The 18member competition dance jazz team took serious steps towards making itself a solid name on the national level this year PERIOD The team competing without the coaches and choreographers that most of its competitors had ranked repeatedly at its national competitions PERIOD

At the USA Nationals in Las Vegas the women took sixth place out of  teams  an amazing feat for a team that didnt even make it to the finals for nationals last year and that is choreographed and coached solely by students PERIOD

In its first appearance at the United Dance Association West Coast Dance Championships UCSD took home second place PERIOD The team also grabbed first place at the COA West Open Championships in its first visit at the event PERIOD

In addition to the busy competition schedule the team also makes frequent appearances at UCSD sporting events Greek events and events such as the upcoming Sun God festival PERIOD
