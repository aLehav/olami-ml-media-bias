4108,2007-05-24,"for any 90s ska fan Suburban Legends performance would have satisfied their craving for some rhythmic guitar and some blasting brass sound PERIOD With Brian Robertson on trombone and Luis Beza on trumpet the brass section was complete PERIOD Their ability to perform while playing was impressive to say the least PERIOD It was not all brass  Suburban Legends brought back the piano guitar unveiling their ability to mix up their sound in an extraordinary fashion PERIOD

With a spectacular performance Suburban Legends entertained the small crowd that initially crammed the barricade PERIOD After a short amount of time a few songs and a bit more blazing brass sounds more people crowded the stage to watch the Suburban Legends perform PERIOD Robertson Beza and lead singer Vince Walkers coordinated dance between lyrics and notes proved that synchronized dancing is not only for Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake videos PERIOD Robertsons energy showed the crowd that white boys can dance and have fun PERIOD

Walkers style and charisma allowed for some crowd participation when he asked all to duck and hide behind the barricade in order to surprise guitarist Brian Klemm for his birthday PERIOD Show Brian the biggest surprise of all  your hearts Walker said PERIOD Klemm responded with That was the best birthday surprise of all thank you. the ability of Suburban Legends to entertain the crowd was evident in the overwhelming amount of people finding their groove PERIOD With the audience dancing singing along or just having a good time Suburban Legends rocked Harder Stadium at this years Extravaganza  PERIOD
