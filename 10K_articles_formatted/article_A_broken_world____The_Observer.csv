Letter to the Editor  Tuesday August  

We live in a broken world PERIOD According to the United Nations  million people live in extreme poverty PERIOD Many of them would do anything to become Americans PERIOD With more than  illegal immigrants crossing the U.S PERIOD southern border every day how should our government react

Some think we should let people enter freely PERIOD Others think deportation is the solution while many would prefer a middle ground PERIOD Whatever you believe one fact remains PERIOD Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ICE detains immigrants in facilities once they are caught entering illegally PERIOD

Back in April students here at Notre Dame called for divestment from private prisons and detention centers PERIOD They referenced two companies GEO Group and CoreCivic which they stated have a strong incentive to fill each bed and keep people locked up for longer. this is ludicrous PERIOD As private contractors they are providing a service requested by the government PERIOD They have nothing to do with sentencing criminals or choosing who gets detained PERIOD They simply do what the government asks of them PERIOD

Private prisons also have greater incentive than public prisons to maintain clean safe conditions PERIOD If they do not provide sufficient results they will lose their government contracts PERIOD That is why  of GEO Group and CoreCivic facilities have airconditioning PERIOD This is not true of public prisons PERIOD That is why  of GEO Groups ICE processing centers have soccer fields and flatscreen TVs PERIOD Profit motives lead to better inmate care PERIOD Capitalism works PERIOD

We live in a broken world PERIOD I wish people did not live in extreme poverty PERIOD I wish criminals and illegal immigrants did not have to be jailed or detained PERIOD But divesting from private prisons would hurt these people more than anyone else PERIOD These people deserve the best care our government can provide PERIOD

We have all seen the images from detention centers and it is easy to react emotionally and argue no one should profit from detaining people PERIOD

But the U.S PERIOD government should do everything possible to give inmates and detainees the best possible care and service and this is accomplished by publicprivate partnerships through the free market PERIOD
