8160,2023-11-04,"perfection on an individual basis is hard to come by in sports PERIOD You can always get a few more yards shoot a better percentage or have a lower ERA PERIOD In golf every player looks forward to one moment of perfection PERIOD A hole in one PERIOD

Taylor Sidzyik has played countless rounds of golf PERIOD Competitively and recreationally Sidzyik has taken aim at pins his entire life but had yet to get a holeinone PERIOD That is until a breezy morning at Shoreline Golf Course PERIOD

It was hole no PERIOD  a par four over the water Sidzyik said PERIOD We were playing from the white tees PERIOD The wind was blowing off the lake from the left. the hole is a dog leg left PERIOD It plays  yards but is under  if the player elects to go over the water thats what Sidzyik did PERIOD

I just take driver out and Im like Im going over the lake Sidzyik said PERIOD The ball hangs ove the lake takes one big hop and my buddy said thats either in the hole or over the green. sidzyik rushed over to the hole as quickly as he could although most golfers dont have to drive  yards to find out PERIOD Sidzyik checked the back of the green while his friend checked the cup PERIOD

He started going crazy and I then I start going crazy Sidzyik said PERIOD My first hole in one. sidzyikss shot was even more out of the ordinary than youd thinkthe senior isnt known as a long ball hitter more of a long iron player PERIOD

I never would have thought Id get a hole in one with a driver because I dont hit it that far Sidzyik said PERIOD I dont really go at the golf ball that hard PERIOD I really have to focus on getting the ball to the fairway. how common are holes in one to competitive golfers It depends on the player PERIOD Some go deep into their careers before getting one if not their entire lives PERIOD Former teammate and UNO alumnus Alex Overfelt had four PERIOD

Its kind of a relief Sidzyik said PERIOD Almost everyone on the team has one PERIOD It was a big relief but also shocking. does having one under his belt change the way Sidzyik approaches the game Hardly PERIOD

Ive played so much competitive golf I dont think about hole in ones I just think about getting on Sidzyik said PERIOD Sometimes you cant go at every pin when youre playing competitively PERIOD I usually dont think about it that much. sidzyik picked up the game of golf from his cousin who played at Nebraska Wesleyan PERIOD Sidzyik caddied him in some of his tournaments PERIOD After learning his son took an interest in golf Sidzyiks dad picked up the sport taking him to practices and the range PERIOD

As for how Sidzyik keeps his game sharp The Mav golfer along with the other UNO golfers get regular access to Oak Hills Country club PERIOD He also works at Tara Hills PERIOD

I always have to work on my short game Sidzyik said PERIOD Im probably the shortest hitter on the team PERIOD I played with the new recruits coming in and I still hit it shorter than everyone on the team PERIOD So I have to work on my long irons and my hybrids because I cant always get it to the green as much as the other kids. so just what made Sidzyik pull out the driver and line up for the bomb
We were playing a scramble that day Sidzyik said PERIOD There were already two shots out there. with a little luck and a touch of irony Sidzyik got his first ace and a splashor more so an avoidanceof perfection PERIOD

I would have never hit the shot if we were playing regular golf. a post shared by The Gateway thegatewayuno",Sidzyik achieves ace on a scramble gamble - Gateway,"University of Nebraska, Omaha"
