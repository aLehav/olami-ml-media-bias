Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  LETTER WRITERApril  

I would like to raise a few points in response to the Northern Stars editorial on Friday PERIOD

Every Constitutional right entails a potential for its abuse and a concomitant endangerment to society the reasoning the Board employs would effectively eliminate every right we have PERIOD Regulating our rights in the name of safety is a slippery slope which should only be ventured upon with the utmost caution strictly limited to laws no broader than necessary to be expedient PERIOD

In that vein HB4393 was clearly little more than legislative selfgratification the appearance that something was being done without actually accomplishing anything PERIOD There is no way it would have deterred criminals from getting guns PERIOD If anything at all it would only have served to frustrate lawabiding gun owners in their constructive activities PERIOD

Einstein once said that doing more of the same thing and expecting a different result is insanity PERIOD Illinois already has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country yet are we a shining example of crime control

Not by any measure PERIOD Maybe its time we take a cue from the majority of the other states and move in a more efficacious direction on this issue PERIOD
