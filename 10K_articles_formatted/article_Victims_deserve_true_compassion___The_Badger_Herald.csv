On April  the Senate Health Committee held a public hearing regarding the Compassionate Care for Rape Victims Act which included speakers who were survivors of sexual assault health care providers advocates and community members who voiced their support for the passage of SB  PERIOD This bill ensures that victims of rape or incest receive immediate access to safe efficient methods of pregnancy prevention PERIOD This occurs by requiring all Wisconsin emergency rooms to provide rape victims with information about and access to emergency contraception PERIOD This seems like a simple concept but a  study found that  percent of Wisconsin emergency rooms fail to provide access to EC to rape victims PERIOD

The trauma of rape makes it difficult for women to ask questions about options like emergency contraception and this is a situation where time is critical PERIOD Therefore this service must be offered to victims of rape when they are present at the emergency room PERIOD Victims have enough to worry about regarding sexually transmitted infections other health concerns and policy reports to worry about an unintended pregnancy as well PERIOD This bill does not force victims to take EC and gives victims some control during this terrifying experience PERIOD

Opponents of the bill argue that it violates the beliefs of hospital staff who may oppose EC by requiring them to dispense this medication PERIOD As a future pharmacist I would hope that the focus of concern in these situations would be for the victim and not the hospital staff PERIOD I know that I would never want my personal beliefs to interfere with providing a rape victim with comprehensive and compassionate care PERIOD
