977,2021-05-26,"the fastest strawberry pickers can complete approximately nine baskets per hour being paid between . and . per basket PERIOD Growers say this piece rate can suffice for minimum wage but that is rarely the case PERIOD Exposed to dangerous pesticides unable to access benefits like healthcare and often facing threats of deportation farmworkers face backbreaking labor and depend on nonprofits to provide essential services their employers dont.Though farmworkers grow and harvest the food we see at Safeway Trader Joes and the UC Santa Cruz dining halls the harsh reality is they can barely afford to purchase groceries themselves.To combat this issue the Center for Farmworker Families CFF provides essential items and services for farmworkers that they dont receive from their employers PERIOD With food provided by Second Harvest Food Bank the CFF held their monthly distribution event on May  serving some  farmworker families  the vast majority being undocumented Oaxacan migrant workers.The CFF headed by Executive Director Dr PERIOD Ann Lopez is a nonprofit organization that promotes awareness around issues affecting farmworkers and advocates for farmworkers rights both on the fields and at the legislative level.What were doing at our distributions is basically subsidizing growers Lopez said PERIOD The pay is so low that farmworkers cant buy their own food PERIOD They have a choice of paying rent and starving or not paying rent and buying some food PERIOD And I dont think anyone should be faced with that choice when they worked so hard.At the May  distribution event farmworkers were able to access basic needs ranging from food clothing and toiletries to services like acupuncture and massages to relieve back pains resources they often do not receive given their low wages and scarce benefits.Low Wages and Piece RatesAccording to the National Agricultural Workers Surveylast conducted in  onethird of farmworker families in the U.S PERIOD live below the poverty level and nearly  percent do not have health insurance PERIOD Further exemptions to the Fair Labor Standards Act mean that in many cases farmworkers are not guaranteed basic labor rights like overtime pay mandatory breaks or even a minimum wage.Farmworkers are often paid either in piece rates where they receive a set pay per box or basket of produce or in a combination of piece rates and hourly wages PERIOD Using the example of strawberries UCSC community studies professor Julie Guthman says that while growers justify the use of piece rates by claiming it increases productivity and allows farmworkers to get higher wages that isnt always the case.Growers say that the workers like piece rates because they get higher wages per hour but only the fastest people can make that much to make it worth it Guthman said PERIOD So theyre working at a breakneck pace hunched over  running through the fields to bring strawberries back to the station to be counted before they run back out and start picking again.Many growers have attempted to assist farmworkers by providing trolleys or growing a big easytosee variety of strawberry Guthman added but theyre more hesitant to meaningfully raise wages.Other growers like JSM Organics in Aromas Calif. pay their farmworkers between  and  an hour as opposed to piece rates PERIOD JSM is a smallscale familyowned organic farm that employs between  and  farmworkers and grows cane berries strawberries vegetables and flowers.Prompted by his own experience as a farmworker JSM owner Javier Zamora said he didnt want to replicate the breakneck pace of farmwork seen at larger farms.When you work for a big company or conventional farm you do work on a piece rate and they push you to the limit and youre doing work thats not so easy to do Zamora said PERIOD So when I started my own farm I didnt want people to feel the same way PERIOD I didnt want workers to feel like they werent making the money that they deserve.Labor Abuses Target an Already Vulnerable PopulationThe situation is even more dire for undocumented farmworkers who comprise  percent of all farmworkers in California and  percent in Santa Cruz County.Due to their immigration status undocumented farmworkers receive virtually no protections from their employers leaving the door open for rampant labor abuses such as wage theft and union busting PERIOD According to the Natural Resources Defense Council employers nationwide illegally withheld  million from farmworkers between .CFF Director Dr PERIOD Ann Lopez said growers achieve that by refusing to give undocumented farmworkers official contracts and subsequently refusing to pay them their wages PERIOD Growers then leverage deportation threats to keep workers from voicing concerns or addressing these labor violations.Comprehensive immigration reform is Lopezs main concern on her list of issues that would transform farmworkers lives.I dont think any farmworker whos been in the field bent over picking and harvesting food to feed us at their own peril living in poverty should be worried about deportation Lopez said PERIOD For Gods sake whos doing who the favorDespite rhetoric that undocumented people steal jobs and resources they cannot access basic government benefits like food stamps or health care.Former Santa Cruz Mayor and former UCSC community studies professor Mike Rotkin pointed out that farmwork is the work that nobody wants to do.When people talk about we dont need these Mexicans coming into our country and theyre all just taking our jobs away its bullshit because there is no interest in doing farm labor Rotkin said.As a student in the 1960s Rotkin worked as a farmworker in New York and Florida as part of a research program about migrant farmworkers and helped implement a similar program at UC Santa Cruz as a professor during the 1970s PERIOD Through his experience he has seen how even though farmworker conditions have improved they are still subjected to dangerous and hazardous work conditions.Chemicals and Pesticide DriftExposure to harsh chemicals and pesticides significantly contribute to health problems in farmworkers and their children PERIOD According to the UC Global Health Initiative exposure to pesticides can cause increased rates of cancer in farmworkers and neurodevelopmental disorders in their children among other health issues.According to the CFF there are between  physiciandiagnosed cases of pesticide poisoning annually among U.S PERIOD farmworkers whose life expectancy is only  years PERIOD Since cases are underreported estimates suggest the number could be as high as  annual cases.Pesticidepoisoning could affect up to  farmworkers per year in the US. courtesy Micah Williams Center for Farmworker Families.CFF Director Dr PERIOD Ann Lopez said one of the more pressing concerns has to do with restricteduse pesticides which are more toxic and are highlyregulated by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation PERIOD California allows growers to apply for these restricteduse pesticides through Notices of Intent NOI and Lopez believes it is crucial for NOIs to be published ahead of time in the areas they will be used.We want that information published so everybody in the area knows what the chemical is where theyre going to fumigate and when so that people can take protection Lopez said PERIOD I am sick and tired of seeing the impact of these pesticides on the children of farmworkers PERIOD It is absolutely criminal.Despite pesticides being sprayed only on farms pesticide drift can carry the toxic chemicals into neighboring communities and schools PERIOD In  Good Times reported that schools across the Pajaro Valley Unified School District where the majority of students are underprivileged students of color  keep their windows closed as students and teachers alike have come down with pesticiderelated health issues ranging from cancer and neurological disorders to respiratory issues.UC Berkeleys Chamacos Study the longestrunning study on the impact of pesticides on the health of farmworkers children found that children exposed to pesticides while in the womb have significantly lower IQs and shorter attention spans PERIOD Combined with potential physical health impacts during childhood as a result of pesticide exposure Lopez considers what the generational impact of pesticiderelated health issues will be.When I think back on my interviews with farmworkers when I was doing my research about farmworkers the vast majority that I talked to want their kids educated having a career and out of farm work but we steal that from them Lopez said PERIOD How is a kid whose brain doesnt function right going to be successfulOther alternatives to harmful pesticides are possible.UV lights used at night to keep mice away from crops at JSM Organics. photo courtesy Javier Zamora JSM Organics.At JSM Organics Zamora focuses on products that are not harmful to humans to protect his crops and emphasizes innovation and different approaches that can help protect farmworkers PERIOD As opposed to traditional pesticides Zamora uses UV lights at night to keep mice away from crops and certified organic inputs like dusting sulfur and diatomaceous earth which pose little risk to humans.Lopez points to multiple studies by the Rodale Institute and the United Nations that show an organic and regenerative farming future is not only possible but necessary PERIOD The proof is not only in those studies but at UCSCs own Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems which has successfully had fieldscale production for years.This industrial farming system is unsustainable its highly destructive and it doesnt work Lopez said PERIOD If organic and regenerative production can feed the entire planet then why are we poisoning the planet I guess its for profits for the agrochemical industry. though farmworkers grow and harvest the food we see at

planet then why are we poisoning the planet I guess its for profits for the agrochemical industry. prompted by his own experience as a farmworker JSM owner Javier Zamora said he didnt want to

despite rhetoric that undocumented people steal jobs and resources they cannot access basic government benefits like food stamps or health care.Former Santa Cruz Mayor and former UCSC community studies professor Mike Rotkin pointed out that farmwork is the work that nobody wants to do.When people talk about we dont need these Mexicans coming into our country and theyre all just taking our jobs away its bullshit because there is no interest in doing farm labor Rotkin said.As a student in the 1960s Rotkin worked as a farmworker in New York and Florida as part of a research program about migrant farmworkers and helped implement a similar program at UC Santa Cruz as a professor during the 1970s PERIOD Through his experience he has seen how even though farmworker conditions have improved they are still subjected to dangerous and hazardous work conditions.Chemicals and Pesticide DriftExposure to harsh chemicals and pesticides significantly contribute to health problems in farmworkers and their children PERIOD According to the UC Global Health Initiative exposure to pesticides can cause increased rates of cancer in farmworkers and neurodevelopmental disorders in their children among other health issues.According to the CFF there are between  physiciandiagnosed cases of pesticide poisoning annually among U.S PERIOD farmworkers whose life expectancy is only  years PERIOD Since cases are underreported estimates suggest the number could be as high as  annual cases.Pesticidepoisoning could affect up to  farmworkers per year in the US. courtesy Micah Williams Center for Farmworker Families.CFF Director Dr PERIOD Ann Lopez said one of the more pressing concerns has to do with restricteduse pesticides which are more toxic and are highlyregulated by the
