Its bids season in Geneseo and its hard to ignore PERIOD

This weekend the Geneseo campus experienced its biannual bids weekend celebrating some students acceptance into a Greek organization PERIOD Geneseo recognizes ten social fraternities twelve social sororities and four professional and service organizations PERIOD The Geneseo Intergreek Council webpage states The bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood among members of Greek organizations are irreplaceable and result in friendships that last a lifetime. as of Spring  around one in three Geneseo students were involved in a Greek organization PERIOD Firstsemester freshmen are not allowed to rush so most experience their first bids weekend from afar PERIOD Alice a senior recalled I remember first semester freshman year on campus people were going through the campus cheering chanting in the fall PERIOD And I was thinking that is so ridiculous PERIOD Who would ever do that they sound like such idiots. others like Sarah were sure they wanted to join PERIOD It looked like a lot of fun and I wanted to be a part of that fun. bids day looks different for each organization PERIOD Local organizations and fraternities often walk through campus chanting traditional songs and handing out bids in person PERIOD National sororities held their bid acceptance in the Union Ballroom this year letting their rushes run to their chosen sorority PERIOD But almost all Greek organizations hold a party for their newly accepted members on bids night PERIOD

According to Tim a senior who is not affiliated with any organizations all Greek organizations contribute negatively to campus issues PERIOD Greek life upholds all of the things that are wrong with this school he said PERIOD So much gets swept under the rugpeople get abused drugs and alcohol get abused PERIOD Its just a culture that I fail to understand. but even Alice who thought the bids weekend chants were stupid eventually joined a Greek organization PERIOD Now I walk through the campus cheering every semester myself she said PERIOD

So what is it exactly that makes these people change their mind What does a bid really offer to a Geneseo student To find out these answers we asked students Ally Jack and Emma why they joined their organization PERIOD

Most of all companionship Ally said I was looking for an allyship within a group of people. ally is a minority student and said being in an organization has made her life on campus generally easier PERIOD Emma who joined her sorority in fall  said COVID19 influenced her decision PERIOD I didnt rush freshman year because I didnt think I would fit in PERIOD But then COVID happened and I felt like I needed to be a part of something to make more friends. many of the interviewees expressed that joining an organization was necessary to have a good social life in Geneseo PERIOD It has a stranglehold on Geneseo culture Tim who is unaffiliated said PERIOD Honestly its really all the schools social life has to offer. many students belong to clubs which are generally less formal and exclusive than Greek organizations as well as usually free PERIOD But for Ally clubs were not enough PERIOD When you meet someone one of the first questions they ask you is your affiliation she said PERIOD I always felt the clubs I was a part of were not enough of an answer. after joining Ally found that she got some of the allyship she wanted but also struggled with finding her place in her organization PERIOD From the outside she could show off her letters and walk into parties easily. but on the inside she often pondered whether or not she had made the right choice PERIOD

Other interviewees also expressed that getting a bid and joining an organization gave them a sense of identity PERIOD Jack a senior who rushed as a sophomore said Being a part of that organization gives a presence to somebody PERIOD Lets say youre in this one frat PERIOD People know youre in it youre proud of being in it PERIOD People like having that reputation and being able to say yes Im a part of that. this sense of identity can provide comfort and routine to college students PERIOD But whats the tradeoff Tim unaffiliated expressed his concern for hazing and even went so far as to call Greek life a cult complete with hierarchies and initiations. people want to be a part of something so bad they subject themselves to humiliation PERIOD They shell out money to be a part of something. ally confirmed that she wanted to be a part of something so much so that she overlooks the cons of being part of an organization PERIOD It gives me a different sense of identity even if I cant control what that identity looks like. now that these students are a part of something they continue to extend bids to the rest of the student body each semester PERIOD For those who are not a part of something they often still reap the benefits of bids weekend Aimee an unaffiliated senior looks forwards to bids weekend despite her nonaffiliated status PERIOD Im excited for a weekend of drinkingwith more people around people PERIOD Greek life wasnt for me PERIOD I think a lot of people are upset on bids weekend because they are jealous PERIOD But I dont mind that I didnt get a bid. watching the new members accept their bids with glee can certainly be exciting even from afar PERIOD But after bids comes six weeks of pledging a time notorious for hazing rumors and sometimes truths PERIOD Seeing how excited they are you remember what it was like when you were in that position Emma said PERIOD And you know they dont know what theyre in for. when asked if she could share one thing with all newly admitted Greek life members she laughed PERIOD Good luck and enjoy the ride she said PERIOD Good damn luck. web editor for The Lamron SUNY Geneseos student newspaper since  PERIOD
