Football is a game of inches the old saying goes PERIOD Inches made the difference during the Buena Vista University BVU football teams home opener Saturday night against Waldorf where the Beaver defense came up with a goal line stand in the final minute of the fourth quarter to secure a  victory PERIOD

Waldorf got on the scoreboard first via a 3yard quarterback keeper by Cody Smith with less than a minute left in the first quarter PERIOD The Beavers responded with an 8play 83yard drive capped off by a Cody Mowery 10yard touchdown scamper with under two minutes to play in the first half PERIOD The touchdown was set up by a 27yard scramble by Mowery and a 26yard catch by Ben Seitz from Trevor Trunck earlier in the drive PERIOD

The two teams shut each other out in the third quarter before the Warriors took a  lead when Dustin Wilke connected on a 41yard field goal in the opening minute of the fourth stanza PERIOD The Beavers got down to the Waldorf 1yard line on their next drive before Tory Beger crossed the goalline on a quarterback keeper to give BVU its first lead of the game PERIOD Tyler Stolens point after attempt made it a fourpoint advantage for the blue and gold PERIOD

Waldorf marched down to the Beaver 8yard line with less than  seconds remaining in the game PERIOD After backtoback runs by Warrior tailback Julian Ampaw got the ball down to the Beaver 1yard line Smith was stuffed by the BVU defense at the goal line with nine seconds left PERIOD With no timeouts remaining Waldorf scrambled to get a play off but time expired before the ball could be snapped giving the Beavers their first victory of the season which came on the inaugural night game in the history of J PERIOD Leslie Rollins Stadium PERIOD

It was good to get the win PERIOD By no means do we think we played as well as we can 10thyear Head Coach Jay Anderson said PERIOD We have to clean up the turnovers and take advantage of great field position when the opportunity presents itself. mowery rushed for a careerhigh  yards on  touches and had one touchdown while Seitz hauled in five catches for  yards PERIOD Brady Illg led the team in the tackles for the third straight game racking up  in the game PERIOD Zach Mueggenberg followed closely behind with  and Quamaree Harris added nine stops PERIOD

We came out slow offensively which came back to bite us but a win is a win Mowery said It feels good to know that the work you put in during the week pays off PERIOD Ive got to credit my line for opening holes and making the career high possible. the Beavers move to  on the season and open IIAC play Saturday October third at Simpson before returning home on October tenth to take on Loras for Homecoming PERIOD
