8466,2023-11-05,"g.I PERIOD Jobs Magazine recently identified the College of William and Mary as a militaryfriendly school PERIOD The publication which focuses on helping veterans find employment and make the transition into civilian life reviewed more than  universities and gave the designation to what it considered the top  to  percent PERIOD

The magazine used several criteria to determine which schools would earn their seal of approval PERIOD
Militaryfriendly schools are those that have done the most to provide a sense of community on campus and have done the most to recruit and retain students with military experience Senior Brand Manager for G.I PERIOD Jobs Magazine Sean Collins said PERIOD

In addition to waiving the application fee for veterans offering tuition discounts and instate tuition without residency requirements for veterans and participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program the College is also home to a longestablished Reserve Officers Training Corps program a fulltime Veterans Administration and benefits specialist in the office of the University Registrar and an oncampus veterans group the Veterans Society of William and Mary PERIOD

It is great that we were noticed as a militaryfriendly school Office Manager of the military science department Brian Randall said PERIOD I have seen over the years that Ive been here  more and more support for the military from the William and Mary community starting at the top with the president. the School of Education also offers free confidential counseling to students with military experience as part of the New Horizons Family Counseling Center PERIOD The MarshallWythe School of Laws Lewis B PERIOD Puller Jr PERIOD Veterans Benefits Clinic assists veterans and their families in applying for VA benefits and offers referrals to external resources PERIOD

We value diversity of all kinds Associate Provost for Enrollment and Dean of Admission Henry Broaddus said PERIOD One of the most important facets of diversity comes from life experience PERIOD Enrolling veterans as undergraduates  brings a kind of experience and a kind of perspective that we believe is valuable to the social fabric of the campus community  and classroom dynamics. yet Broaddus said the College does not offer the same military accommodations that other peer institutions do PERIOD

Were not as veteranfriendly and accessible as ODU Old Dominion University or a place thats going to be able to offer things like night classes and parttime enrollment  Thats not the kind of institution William and Mary is but there are still plenty of veterans for whom William and Mary is a great match he said PERIOD

Despite the new designation some students affiliated with the military on and offcampus expressed dissatisfaction with accommodations made for military personnel at the College PERIOD

One current student and member of the armed forces who asked that his name be withheld out of concern that he would face repercussions disagreed with G.I PERIOD Magazines ranking PERIOD

I wouldnt say that William and Mary is a militaryunfriendly school he said PERIOD I think some of the professors are quite liberal in the sense that they think we dont really need a military or that kind of thing. he did not find the law school benefits clinic helpful PERIOD

I went there and asked for their help and they said we dont help with that we help with other things  like compensation and pensions mostly he said PERIOD I thought it was a little strange to have a law clinic that was kind of conditional. alex Muth  currently a cadet in the Virginia Army National Guard and member of the Army ROTC program disagreed PERIOD

All of my experiences with William and Mary from a military perspective have been pretty top notch he said PERIOD The VA benefits specialist has been great about contacting me for any programs that have been offered or if theyre having a speaker or contacting me about any benefits I could be eligible for PERIOD In addition for any commitment that Ive had with the National Guard because I drill once a month Ive never had an issue with professors PERIOD Ive been able to work out my schedule with them. save my name email and website in this browser for the next time I comment PERIOD
