Penn State football isnt the only second half team in town PERIOD

Like its counterpart at Beaver Stadium Penn State field hockey only gets stronger as the game goes on PERIOD

I think our team really buys into being a strong second half team because they trust their fitness and their training coach Charlene MorettCurtiss said PERIOD

The No PERIOD  Nittany Lions  scored eight of their  goals this weekend in the second half en route to a  triumph over instate rival Temple on Friday and a  win over No PERIOD  Wake Forest on Sunday PERIOD

For the first  minutes against the Owls Penn State had all of the games chances outshooting Temple   but went into the locker room up just one goal PERIOD

The Nittany Lions found themselves in a similar predicament on Sunday against the Demon Deacons PERIOD

RELATED Penn State field hockey dominates defensively en route to  victory over Temple

I told them at halftime were playing really well but I know we can play better MorettCurtiss said PERIOD This team plays so well together they play as a team they have each others backs and they dont leave anyone hanging on the field. after the halftime whistle the Penn State defense continued to dominate while the offense came to life scoring four goals in each second half and leaving both the Owls and Wake Forest in its dust PERIOD

The two shutouts marked the first time since  that Penn State held two consecutive opponents without a goal when it defeated Drexel and Temple in Philadelphia PERIOD

The efforts of junior goalkeeper Jenny Rizzo kept each shutout intact PERIOD

While the Nittany Lions stifled Temple  to just one shot Rizzo was tested far more often against Wake Forest PERIOD Rizzo a member of the United States U21 field hockey team  made nine saves against the Demon Deacons  PERIOD

RELATEDPenn State field hockey overpowers Wake Forest with aggressive offense

Following Sundays game Rizzo deflected credit to her teammates PERIOD

My defense was on so its not like it was just a oneman team back there Rizzo said PERIOD

Redshirt junior back Cori Conley garnered praise from both MorettCurtiss and Rizzo PERIOD Conley appeared in just three games last season  but shined this weekend for the blue and white PERIOD

Cori just keeps getting better with every game MorettCurtiss said PERIOD Its great to see her composure and her defensive skills. on the offensive end junior forward Moira Putsch had three goals and two assists on the weekend while junior forwardmidfielder Aurelia Meijer scored and assisted twice PERIOD
