Mcleod Ganj is a mountain village in Northern India and the home of His Holiness the Dali Lama the Tibetan government and a sizable population of about  Tibetans all exiles PERIOD

I am spending two weeks here volunteering and living in a Tibetan home PERIOD My Tibetan homestay family is fabulous PERIOD My mom Ama La is cute as can be she speaks great English but cannot read or write she learned entirely from hosting students over the years PERIOD My dad Pa La is older and speaks no English PERIOD He just paces or sits there cutely with his prayer beads PERIOD He is chubby with a big round Tibetan face small friendly eyes and lifewelllived wrinkles PERIOD He has short white stubble on his head and face and a pouted contented expression PERIOD I cannot exchange a word with him but I love him anyway PERIOD

Ama La came here when she was five and has been here most of her life but her husband did not escape to India in exile until he was  PERIOD There are some pretty harrowing stories of escapes out of Tibet in the Conversational English classes one of the students said he trekked through Tibets snowy mountains for  days in hiding to make it over the Nepalese border before coming to Mcleod Ganj PERIOD This story is not an anomaly this is the norm I have learned PERIOD

My parents have six grown children all of whom live away from home PERIOD Among them are a monk a doctor and a son studying in England right now on one of two scholarships given to Tibetan students jointly from the English and Tibetan governments PERIOD They are such proud parents

Their house seems very very nice PERIOD I imagine that Ama and Pa Las children take very good care of them PERIOD It is cement with real glass windows painted walls and woodpatterned sticky focus paper on the floor PERIOD They have a mini wooden elk head on the wall which cracks me up and a bathroom with tile floors a western toilet a mirror and even a shelf with a variety of toiletries PERIOD The bathroom is complete with toilet paper PERIOD I assure you this is well off PERIOD

They have a shiny  Trinton Sony television that they are constantly watching world news on PERIOD I have realized that the TV is the center of life for many of our Tibetan host families with good reason PERIOD For the past half a century these poor people have been clinging onto hope waiting for help PERIOD What a way to liveconstantly waiting in an inbetween state PERIOD They have their own local Tibetan station with constant information on the Dali Lama and the latest influx of refugees PERIOD Roughly  exiles leave Tibet each year and today Tibetans are outnumbered by Chinese on their own land PERIOD

Within  minutes of talking my host mom and I were already commemorating and congratulating each other on Obamas win PERIOD For them it is seen as one more small window of hope that the world will become better PERIOD It is disheartening that these people must pay such close attention to what is happening in the world around them when only  years ago they were living in the dark ages stuck in the Tibet plateaus with no electricity real roads or even the use of the wheel PERIOD

They went from complete seclusion to full emersion what world issues would have interested them I hate politics PERIOD I wish that I could sleep at night and ignore them altogether PERIOD But since my countrys decisions and my culture so profoundly affect the entire world I am obliged to care PERIOD The Tibetans on the other hand care even though they affect no one PERIOD
