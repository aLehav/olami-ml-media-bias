Updated November     pm





Juliet Warren stands for a portrait on April  at UMs Fitness and Recreation Center where she regularly works out PERIOD Warren  began her powerlifting journey in May  PERIOD Although she started out to prepare for her wildland firefighting job last summer she discovered a deep love for powerlifting PERIOD

University of Montana sophomore Juliet Warren is a selfproclaimed people pleaser PERIOD

As she steps up to the pullup bar she glances around at the other gymgoers in the Adams Center before jumping up and gripping the bar to support her entire body weight PERIOD Warren always ensures she has perfect form in case others decide to watch her during her 10rep sets PERIOD

Warren began working out six days a week in April  to prepare for her wildland firefighting job over the summer but transitioned to devoting all her focus to her training in the fall for a May  bodybuilding competition PERIOD

After struggling with the extreme dieting and the mental toll of a regimented lifestyle Warren now has shifted to powerlifting and said she is finally doing something for herself rather than to impress others PERIOD

I liked feeling strong and I liked showing other people that I was strong Warren said PERIOD Ive realized through my whole process that I dont have to prove to people Im in good shape and strong though PERIOD I can just do that for myself. warren has always been a high achiever in athletics even if she refused to acknowledge her success PERIOD She is from Des Moines Iowa and was a successful swimmer in middle school PERIOD Despite her competitiveness including placing high in regional competitions she quit when she was  after forcing herself to continue to please her team PERIOD

You get kicked in the face for three hours at a time and I just kept thinking Why am I just staring at the bottom of the pool I kept going because I was good at it Warren said PERIOD

Like her efforts in school Warren also put significant work into soccer to follow in her parents footsteps and make them proud PERIOD Warren did not miss a single soccer game despite struggling with central sensitization a form of chronic pain with no treatment or cure that impacted her leg mobility throughout high school PERIOD

I just didnt let myself miss it PERIOD I didnt want other people to know that I was going through this PERIOD I just wanted to seem like Im normal and OK Warren said PERIOD It is hard though because you dont see anything wrong with me so people just assume that Im fine PERIOD But its not going to kill me so I might as well just deal with it. she played through high school and saw multiple scholarship offers in the Midwest but decided to go to UM to live somewhere new and for the peaceful wilderness environment PERIOD She discovered her true sentiments about soccer during her senior year of high school when she enjoyed the absence of practice PERIOD

School was shut down during the season and I realized Damn Im really happy when Im not playing soccer PERIOD What the fuck am I doing Warren said PERIOD

Warren was refreshed when she came to UM and felt at home in Missoula PERIOD Although focused on the environment in some way she switched majors multiple times during her freshman year at one point planning to speed through her undergraduate to become an environmental attorney at age  PERIOD

She settled on resource conservation and a minor in wildland fire science after she dropped everything last summer to work as a wildland firefighter in the Pacific Northwest PERIOD She applied as a joke in April and discovered her love for the work  and her love for the physical training  throughout the summer PERIOD As one of two women on her 20person team she fit in well by keeping up with the physical labor and endearing the men with her obscene vocabulary throwing out at least one fuck in almost every sentence PERIOD

Her spontaneous decision and completely reorienting her life goals was so cool to watch Warrens roommate Amelia Hawes said PERIOD When shes passionate about something Ive always known her to be a focused and driven person PERIOD This was a new side of her but I felt like it was there the whole time PERIOD Shes just so unapologetically herself. from her time lifting when she trained for the job she returned in the fall determined to jump into the bodybuilding lifestyle PERIOD Aside from enjoying the increased strength Warren sought after the pumping ironesque extreme body type where peoples first impression of her were her muscles PERIOD

I know it might not be appealing for most people but in my mind the more muscle I have the more physically attractive I am Warren said PERIOD I try to be more accepting of myself but sometimes Ill be in the gym and think damn my arms look so small. im trying to work on it. warren created an Instagram account for her fitness journey to display her progress which she said was a fuck you to popular students from her high school and a big part of her motivation PERIOD

Warren thrived during her bulking period to build up muscle mass PERIOD When she shifted to begin cutting the term for trimming down fat to expose muscle her bodybuilding journey took a turn PERIOD Between adding more intense cardio on top of lifting and eating very little to lose weight the drastic routine worsened her anxiety and her chronic pain became more persistent PERIOD Rather than the pain arising occasionally Warren felt the pain afflict a different part of her body each week  and had to adjust exercises to accommodate the symptoms PERIOD

She went to the ER during a severe panic attack at the end of March at which point she realized bodybuilding was damaging her physical and mental health and she needed to shift to a new athletic endeavor PERIOD

I want to compete in powerlifting now because then I dont have to starve myself its just about lifting the heaviest PERIOD I dont need to push myself to the limits when Im about to break Warren said PERIOD My attitude is a lot more positive with food and working out in general now PERIOD Before I wasnt working out for me but now its just for me. warrens goals of feeling strong and at peace with her physique remain the same but she said working for herself instead of impressing her peers and bodybuilding judges has improved her selfworth and her training habits PERIOD But one of the best perks of her new powerlifting journey She can preserve her body hair two years in the making PERIOD

Fuck the patriarchy bodybuilding is built on patriarchy PERIOD I would have had to shave my entire body because theyll take off points for it Warren said PERIOD Im so happy I dont have to do that now PERIOD Fuck them I love my armpit hair. in  the previous dean of the University of Montanas College of Health David Forbes retired and encouraged professor Reed Humphrey to apply for the job. read moreAnother dean down more interims to come
