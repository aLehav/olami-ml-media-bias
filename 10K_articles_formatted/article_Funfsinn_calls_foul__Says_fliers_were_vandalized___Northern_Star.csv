By  Liz BaxterMarch  

DeKALB  Student Association presidential candidate Aaron Funfsinn alleges that dirty politics are attempting to derail his campaign PERIOD

Funfsinn filed a complaint for alleged election fraud with Erick Brenes the election commissioner on March  PERIOD

In the complaint Funfsinn said his campaign fliers which he posted in several locations throughout the Holmes Student Center had been vandalized PERIOD

Several Funfsinn campaign fliers were systematically vandalized through out the HSC Funfsinn said PERIOD

Funfsinn said obscenities and derogatory remarks were written on the fliers the pictures eyes poked out and a mustache similar to Adolf Hitlers drawn on his picture PERIOD Some were turned upside down and others were removed completely PERIOD

The presidential candidate said he observed the fliers in normal condition near the bus pickup doors in the HSC early in the evening of March  PERIOD

Several hours later they were gone PERIOD And upon checking the

fliers at the entrance to the Huskies Den were vandalized he said PERIOD

Funfsinn feels the act wasnt a coincidence as fliers for other candidates remained unharmed PERIOD

There were many fliers placed in different parts of the building PERIOD I have a strange perception it was political sabotage he said PERIOD The powers that be are fearful because this a competitive race where you have three candidates PERIOD The vote will be split three ways PERIOD If no candidate gets  percent of the vote then it goes to a runoff a week later PERIOD It could be a very interesting election. funfsinn will compete with presidential candidates Jarvis Purnell and Luis Zaragoza D in the upcoming election PERIOD

I think it is childish to destroy someone elses hard work Brenes said PERIOD I dont know who did it but if I find out I will take action against them. anyone with information regarding the identity of the vandal is encouraged to contact Brenes at  PERIOD
