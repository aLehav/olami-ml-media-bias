A few clouds PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



I find few characteristics more detestable than front running PERIOD Those who only show support or affinity after popularity or success accompanies the image of an object or group display a lack of constancy and dedication PERIOD There are a lot of people who turn their heads and pinch their noses at the mention of sports but this years Bengals serve as a relevant example of hopping the bandwagon within our own community PERIOD 

If the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs take an L this Sunday in the Jungle prepare to see people who havent supported the Bengals in a dozen years suddenly act as if theyve been loyal fans through the era where the team was often used as an allpurpose punch line for late night entertainers PERIOD 

Another evident example of this form of chameleons behavior is the Midwestern Lakers fan PERIOD It is improbable that these people were such devout fans when Nick Van Exel was their best player. they are the same people we went to grade school with who were diehard Bulls fans at the time of their championship era PERIOD When Shaq and Kobes reign ends in L.A. all the yellow and purple merchandise these overnight fans wear will be retired to the same section of the closet as their old Bulls gear and Hypercolor shirts PERIOD 

No matter what circumstance fake or fickle loyalty is exhibited under it shows how little some people value the patience courage and dedication which are integral aspects of unconditional support PERIOD Front running is a visible concept of sports culture yet it also permeates and molds over less trivial matters such as politics and interpersonal relationships PERIOD 

In present day America opposition to matters of national policy have been lessened by the tendency of our citizens to assume the majority rule system always reflects the best choice PERIOD Without thoroughly examining issues independently it is difficult to understand what is happening in the world around us PERIOD Dissent to established systems isnt discouraged solely through Big Brother enforcement PERIOD Many choose not to state beliefs contrary to the will and disposition of the ruling class because they prefer to bite their tongues and be seen as patriotic than express their feelings and take the heat that comes along with it PERIOD 

While leapfrogging in matters such as politics and sports seem to be community oriented issues when it transpires within the context of interpersonal relationships the results tend to hit home a bit more PERIOD The consequences of front running amongst friends and significant others are equally devastating and educational PERIOD 

When the relationship seemingly preordained by the stars for you to be satisfied with down to the shared burial plot explodes and fragments a lot can be learned about the people who were considered friends during it PERIOD When the fecal matter hits the fan the motives and true feelings of others become obvious PERIOD Some people do whatever it takes to avoid choosing sides and make it clear that both participants in the now defunct relationship are cool and that there are no monsters PERIOD 

Others bask in the old ladys sewing circle gossip and cast a vote as if they were watching something that makes you dumber by looking on the FOX network PERIOD Never mind the fact that while the relationship was in progress friendship seemed authentic and heartfelt PERIOD When an opportunity arises many dont care a bit about the sensitivity of the situation PERIOD For these people the rift and splintering that a breakup are all about is the perfect time to shift allegiances and sacred trusts for the sake of appearing a certain way and reaping the benefits thereof PERIOD However a lack of constancy character and loyalty exhibits itself it is pleasant to hope that one day the chameleons responsible for this abhorrent behavior will come across the plaid background they cant replicate PERIOD
