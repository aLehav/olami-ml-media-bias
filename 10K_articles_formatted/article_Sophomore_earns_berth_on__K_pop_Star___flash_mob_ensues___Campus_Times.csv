Sophomore Brian Shin is so modest about his achievement that its almost hard to believe he will soon be performing in front of thousands of people on South Korean national television in a talent show based on survival rounds akin to those on American Idol. he comes across in demeanor as reserved and slightly shocked about his accomplishment  discussing it almost as though discussing the achievements of someone else PERIOD

And yet his accomplishment is no small matter PERIOD Shin earned a spot on Kpop Star a South Korean reality television competition that auditioned candidates in cities worldwide PERIOD The three largest entertainment labels in South Korea  SM Entertainment YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment  have representatives at the show PERIOD The final overall winner of the competition debuts with one of the companies and also wins a cash prize of  hundred million won approximately  two brand new vehicles and numerous other opportunities for fame PERIOD

Shin traveled to New York City for an audition on Sept PERIOD  competing against  to  other contestants he said PERIOD Only  passed on to the second round PERIOD

Shin said that he thought he had not made the cut believing he didnt even do that well at the audition but received a phone call on Sunday while taking a bus back to Rochester PERIOD

I was surprised and stoked he said describing an overwhelming phone call in which he was bombarded with questions. shin said that he believes one reason he was selected could be the fact that he performed an acoustic rendition of the song Gangnam Style by rapper PSY which he believes showed judges his originality and creative side. candidates are permitted to perform in any form they choose  they can dance rap or sing PERIOD Shin claims that dancing is not his forte PERIOD He has been playing the guitar and singing after teaching himself the trade in eighth grade having never received formal instruction PERIOD

Its just something Ive always really liked Shin said PERIOD Its my main pass time and hobby. still Shin said that earning a spot on this show was not something he was explicitly aiming at PERIOD

Its never been my absolute goal but its something that has really interested me Shin said PERIOD I never thought I would get on. shin who is studying international relations at UR with a focus on Asian studies will be leaving school in midOctober to participate on the show during which time he will stay with his grandparents in South Korea PERIOD He said his parents number one concern is his education although he is completely fine with resting a semester if necessary given that many of his South Korean friends are obligated to take significant time off from their college education for military service  sometimes as much as a year or more PERIOD

Contestants advance on the show in oneweek increments so Shin could be in Korea for as short a period of time as one week or until April if he wins PERIOD He humbly acknowledges that the latter option is unlikely. regardless hes already gotten a taste of the fame that might be in his future PERIOD

On Wednesday Sept PERIOD  the show came to UR to film Shin who with the help of friends organized a dancing flash mob of students in front of Rush Rhees Library PERIOD

I felt the pressures of the media when I was told I had to dance Shin said PERIOD He had to learn most of the dance the night before and admitted that he forgot  percent of the routine during the filming most of which was edited out PERIOD

I was very happy with the turnout he said PERIOD It looked really cool in front of Rush Rhees and I was more excited about our school being on TV PERIOD Im really proud of our school. shins friend and senior Anthony Wan said that he was unaware Shin was going through the selection process until Shin contacted him to ask him to do the dance on the day that the show was coming to film PERIOD

Needless to say I was extremely excited for him to have made it and also because we would get to have our flash mob publicized on national Korean television Wan said PERIOD

Wan handled the logistics  choreography and leading practices  of the flash mob with the help of some friends PERIOD The group had originally planned to do it later in September but extended practices to prepare for the earlier date after learning that Shin would be filmed PERIOD

I think it was an overwhelming success  more people than I ever could have imagined showed up to watch and join in he said PERIOD

The original point was to perform a Rochester Style parody of the original viral Gangnam Style music video a South Korean pop music hit by PSY PERIOD The UR video will be filmed and edited through the end of September and released in early October Wan said PERIOD

Wan added that he is extremely excited to follow Shins progress this fall PERIOD

While I have not personally heard his performance I have no doubts of his vocal and instrumental abilities and I do hope I can hear him perform someday Wan said PERIOD
