Marlen Cardenas ReporterFebruary  

When Stephany Garcia was trying to find a campus ministry she felt comfortable joining she was about to give up until she heard an announcement at a fall  Campus Crusade for Christ or Cru meeting about a new campus ministry for the Latinx community PERIOD

I was like This is like a sign from God the junior industrial design major said PERIOD I grew up in Colombia and I was not very comfortable reading the Bible in English or praying in English because then I would focus more on the words. destino is a ministry that is part of Cru and meets once a week for Bible study PERIOD

Carol Ascencio who graduated in  and her sister Raquel started Destino in fall  because they said they realized the Latinx community on campus is the biggest congregation yet no one was reaching out to them PERIOD

I was trying to find something that I identified with in this school and nothing stood out PERIOD I didnt see many people of color or people that spoke Spanish at the beginning Garcia said PERIOD Destino is a small mostly Hispanic community that tries to achieve a space for students to be vulnerable and I feel like we do not see much of that in Appalachian. freshman apparel design  merchandising major Stephanie Orellana likes Destino because it is a smaller group of people that she feels like she can relate to PERIOD

A lot of the ministries at App are not very diverse so this being a smaller group and with people that share your culture you feel a lot closer with them and they understand where you are coming from Orellana said PERIOD

Senior exercise science major Letissia Akueka said she also feels the most comfortable at Destino even though she is not Latinx PERIOD

I joined because I was looking for a Bible study and I have been to several ones and I just did not feel comfortable Akueka said PERIOD It is just nice to culturally relate to other people even though I am African. during Destino meetings members read certain Bible verses and talk about how it relates to their daily lives PERIOD

Destino is a small mostly Hispanic community that tries to achieve a space for students to be vulnerable and I feel like we do not see much of that in Appalachian PERIOD

 Stephany Garcia

Sometimes we are very personal and we get down to what has been bothering us and we also pray for each other Orellana said PERIOD

Since starting Ascencio said the club has grown from five to  members PERIOD

Destino is really big around the U.S. especially in California PERIOD They have different Destino groups around different universities Garcia said PERIOD

Destino had a conference in California in January and a couple of members from App State attended PERIOD

We saw a bunch of different people Akueka said PERIOD It was nice to see Destino on a bigger scale. garcia said seeing larger Destino groups from universities across the U.S PERIOD gave her hope that the same will happen at App State PERIOD

If you do not feel represented in a group Destino is that space for you to at least feel represented because your voice is going to be heard Garcia said PERIOD You will be joining a familia. destino meets every Wednesday at  p.m PERIOD in Plemmons Student Union Room  PERIOD
