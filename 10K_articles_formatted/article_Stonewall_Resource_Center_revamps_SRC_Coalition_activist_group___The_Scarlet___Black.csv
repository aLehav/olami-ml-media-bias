The Stonewall Resource Center SRC provides numerous resources to Grinnell students such as a GWSS lending library a library with queer literature a clothing closet with free clothing for use by transgender students a space for identity based support groups to meet and is also a place for students to just relax PERIOD Recently a group of students who are involved with the SRC decided to create a new group the SRC Coalition otherwise known as StoneCo PERIOD

StoneCo is not a new group to campus however PERIOD The group ended four years ago but students decided to revitalize it due to what they saw as a need in the community PERIOD Unlike the SRCs provision of material resources and spaces StoneCo is an LGBT action group and is run solely by students PERIOD

We want to work on improving life on campus for LGBT students and for everyone but its a nonidentity based group where people can come and fix things that they want fixed on campus and work together said Erin Gaschott  who is helping to restart StoneCo PERIOD

StoneCo is a group that is open to anyone  members dont need a history of queer activism in order to be a member or take part in its actions on campus PERIOD

While the groups efforts center on campus change they do not focus on only the College community PERIOD

Were not necessarily limiting ourselves to campus said Ian McConnaughay  PERIOD If people come to us with issues they want to take on beyond that scope were definitely willing to consider it. goals of StoneCo include getting more speakers on campus and providing teaching and training sessions for professors about transinclusivity and important gender issues PERIOD

The members of StoneCo also plan to review insurance policies and examine current health care and mental health care providers PERIOD

Were going to try to figure out the degree to which those people are queer and trans friendly McConnaughay said PERIOD

A longterm goal of StoneCo is to make the SRC itself more accessible PERIOD Examples of this accessibility would be obtaining a ramp at the entrance of the SRC and ensuring that events hosted by the SRC are open to people beyond the campus PERIOD

StoneCo also wants to make the LGBT resources of the SRC more visible at Grinnell PERIOD This would mean making the resources known to prospective students and adding information on the colleges web page about resources the SRC offers PERIOD

StoneCo works to provide resources and information for transitioning students as well PERIOD Some of these resources include locating both laser hair removal clinics and informed consent clinics and collecting qualitative data on these clinics such how sensitive the clinics are towards transitioning students and correct gendering PERIOD

The recent election also provided the students incentive to revitalize StoneCo PERIOD

It felt like something we could do to make the world a better place because its just so easy to feel powerless Gaschott said PERIOD

StoneCo was officially revamped this semester PERIOD

It was an attempt to feel galvanized into action McConnaughay said PERIOD

In terms of group organization StoneCo itself aims to be egalitarian in nature PERIOD

Its a nonhierarchical group so everyones on the same playing field PERIOD Everyone can get help if they need it said Narz Nore  PERIOD There might be people who take on more tasks but they are no means higher up. stoneCo will not only be a resource for Grinnell students but for the Grinnell community as well PERIOD One of the groups goals is to provide resources to students at Grinnell High School PERIOD These resources could be as simple as advice or even a mentorship program PERIOD

The easiest way for students to get involved with StoneCo is to come to the meetings PERIOD

If theres an issue that students want help with or something that they see a problem with even if they dont know how to fix it come to the meeting Emma KalkowskiFarrand  said PERIOD

If students are afraid to bring an issue up in person StoneCo offers access to an anonymous app Candid where students can voice their concerns PERIOD Students can download Candid and select StoneCo to use this resource PERIOD

StoneCo meets Thursday nights at  p.m PERIOD in JRC  PERIOD
