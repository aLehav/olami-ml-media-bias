5906,2023-07-11,"when students register for fall classes starting in April registrationaccess time will be determined by how close students are to completing their degree  not their classification PERIOD

David Laude chemistry professor and senior vice provost for enrollment and graduation management said the current system for determining registrationaccess time with students classified as seniors registering first and freshman registering last is broken. over the last couple of decades there has been this trend toward students earning semester credit hours through placement credit or summer credits so that its very common for a student to arrive on campus and achieve sophomore or even junior standing  even as a freshman Laude said PERIOD The problem is that we have dramatically shifted the number of students we would refer to as seniors  where there are far far more of that particular population than anyone else. according to Laude about  percent of students are currently classified as seniors and therefore register on the first two days PERIOD Laude said after the new system is implemented approximately . percent of students will register within the first two days PERIOD

Laude said he saw the possibility to create a more specific measurement of how far students are from completing their degreethrough his work with Shelby Stanfield vice provost and registrar PERIOD The team worked to redefine the interactive degree audit tool  an online tool students can use to calculate how far they arefrom graduation PERIOD

If there are two kids applying for a particular course  one of them needs it because theyre about to graduate the other one doesnt need it  but because their name starts with an L instead of a Q they get it ahead of time Laude said PERIOD In my mind the kids that most need a class are the kids that are closestto graduation. associate vice provost Carolyn Connerat said when students are double majoring only the major closest to completion will be considered when determining registration access time PERIOD

Laude said the new system will help encourage students to select a major earlier PERIOD

The hope is that we can help students to go through the personal process of figuring out what kind of major they would like to have before they arrive on campusand that will get them launched into their degree plans as soon as they can Laude said PERIOD If a student is uncertain of what courses they want then they should be registering later because theyre registering for courses that are typically those you would expect someone to have their freshman year. biomedical engineering senior Shehryar Siddiqui said he is unsure of how the new system will affect him PERIOD

Im technically a junior right now by year and I have a lot of transfer hours that once worked well for me in terms ofregistration but this might change that Siddiqui said PERIOD

Laude said some transfer students will be affected by the change but the problems they encounter will be a result of the varying structures between schools rather than the new process exclusively PERIOD

Initially it may be the case that there are going to be some transfer students who are not going to be as far along the way tograduation but thats not a consequence of our process Laude said PERIOD Its just a consequence of the fact that the advising structure and the admissions structure wasnt as good as it needed to be. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",Registration order to be based on degree progress instead of credit hours starting April â€“ The Daily Texan,University of Texas Austin
