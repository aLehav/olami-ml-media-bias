8391,2023-10-25,"a popular food item for students in Keene State Colleges Night Owl Caf have sizzled away on Fridays PERIOD Sizzlers which are fried sandwiches with an array of fillings to choose from are now no longer being offered to students on Fridays because of campuswide budget cuts PERIOD

Keene State is looking far and wide for different ways to consolidate the budget within student services PERIOD With that comes a few changes for Keene State Dining Services PERIOD

This was an area where we were asked to look at the services we provide and figure out which services didnt seem to be providing as much service as the other services were providing said Keene State Dining Services General Manager Josef Quirinale PERIOD

The option to remove sizzlers from the Friday menu was one of the few things that were given as an option to curtail as an effect of the budget cuts PERIOD

We carefully looked at all areas and on Fridays the sizzler isnt as popular as it is Monday through Thursday said Quirinale PERIOD The decision was made and it wasnt made by us quite honestly PERIOD It was a campus decision and certain items were chosen from the list that we provided as services to be curtailed. while most of the items on the list pertain to internal operations a few involve the students PERIOD Some of those include slight menu changes as well as a cease to the popular Wednesday Night Cobbler dessert line PERIOD

We ended up having to provide the cobbler line less often because there is a labor issue associated with that said Quirinale PERIOD Dessert is dessert PERIOD We make dessert but theres an attendant that has to set up for that event and serve it and that is labor intensive. kSC junior Hannah Rettig mentioned that there are a few options that she can think of as alternatives to suspending the Friday operation of sizzlers PERIOD Its like four hours that youre paying people to stand there said Rettig PERIOD I feel like maybe even closing Hoot n Scoot instead depending on how busy it is might be better. rettig is one of many students that have high praise for sizzlers including telling the beauty of them to prospective students PERIOD I know when I give tours I tell all the tours that sizzlers are awesome and theyre very unique to Keene and Keene State said Rettig PERIOD

Even with the high praise for sizzlers some students say that the change hasnt really affected them PERIOD I dont get sizzlers very often said KSC junior Courtney Dillon PERIOD I dont take advantage of that sizzlers enough PERIOD Ive probably only had two sizzlers this year PERIOD For me I didnt even know it had happened. i definitely think sizzlers are awesome said Rettig and theyre Sodexo only paying two people to stand there and make sizzlers. she continued I think a lot of students take advantage of sizzlers because theyre good. while the decision seemed to be an easy one for the campus Quirinale said that it wasnt an easy choice to decide what to cut costs from PERIOD

Our job is really to provide as much variety and as much satisfaction for the students as we possibly can said Quirinale PERIOD We do that so when it comes time for us to be told we need to trim your operation a little bit and where can you trim it its difficult for us to choose but we have to choose what we feel will create a lesser of an effect. while the cobbler line will return for Thanksgiving dinner in the Zorn Dining Commons most services will not return unless an increase in budget occurs PERIOD

When we curtail something we really look at the entire picture of what were doing said Quirinale and we find what will have the least impact on the students and those are the things we trim a little bit of. its never an easy decision said Quirinale PERIOD It really isnt. justin Mahan can be contacted at jmahankscequinox.com
