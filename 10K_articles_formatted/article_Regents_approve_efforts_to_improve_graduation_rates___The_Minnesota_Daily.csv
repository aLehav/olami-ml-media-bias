The Board of Regents gave a unanimous goahead Thursday to begin policy plans to improve the Universitys lowerthanaverage graduation and retention rates PERIOD

Currently  percent of University students graduate in six years or more PERIOD This rate ranks last among U.S PERIOD News and World Reports top  institutions PERIOD

This is the most important policy issue facing the University said Vice Provost Craig Swan at the Educational Planning and Policy meeting PERIOD With the regents backing its time to roll up our sleeves and begin working. the regents action comes just one day after the University Senate rejected a proposal banning students from withdrawing from more than  credits during their University education PERIOD

After months of University discussions about the low ranking Swan said its time to stop making excuses and begin policy planning to correct the problem PERIOD

Some board members said the University should focus on increasing fouryear graduation rates PERIOD

I am very supportive of an aggressive approach  it makes me squeamish to even think of a fiveyear graduation rate said Regent Maureen Reed PERIOD

Swan said there are several possible ways to increase graduation rates PERIOD

Topping the list would be a tuition restructuring plan which would allow students taking more than  credits to take additional courses for free he said PERIOD

Currently the University offers halfprice tuition after  credits PERIOD

Swan said the University and Michigan State University are the only institutions in the Big Ten that charge money after  credits PERIOD

Rosenthal said implementing clear expectations for students and communicating these through advising is also crucial to changing the problem PERIOD

He said showing students the longterm savings on timely graduation is imperative PERIOD

The average freshman and sophomore take  credits while the average junior takes . and the average senior takes . pERIOD

Swan attributes the decrease in credits to students working more hours later in their college years PERIOD

Students see the immediate income as a bigger deal Swan said PERIOD

The presentation also outlined incentives to students including class and registration queue access PERIOD

St PERIOD Paul Student Representative Kyle Althoff said peer advisers would be a valuable option to add PERIOD

Its going to involve a dramatic culture change he said PERIOD

Regent Michael OKeefe said laying down the expectations is key only if the University provides the tools for students to adapt to the changes PERIOD

University President Mark Yudof said the problem is not unmotivated students but rather a matter of focus and culture. he said the low graduation and retention rates hurt the health of the University in dealing with the state Legislature and maintaining public support PERIOD

I dont know how I would feel sending my daughter to an institution where there is a  percent graduation rate Yudof said PERIOD
