When asked what they look for in a song their answer was immediate PERIOD

The beat Adam Fernandez MSB12 also known by his stage name Dank said PERIOD Ratchet orVonTravisVT Crawford NHS  agreed as if the words were looped over PERIOD

The two Georgetown seniors who met freshman year living on the fifth floor of Village C West have long been passionate about music PERIOD But only recently have they taken it to the dance floor as DJs an idea they hatched overGchatwhile Ratchet was studying in Spain in spring  PERIOD Fast forward to this past Halloween weekend when the DJ duo  now dubbed Ratchet and Dank  landed their first gig at a Georgetown bar The Guards PERIOD It was the first time the studentcentric bar had ever opened up their dance floors on a Thursday putting themselves in Ratchet and Danks hands PERIOD

By the time I arrived at halfpast  the place was packed PERIOD Faces familiar from weekends misspent lined the tables PERIOD The dance floor was a massive throng that you had to slither and shake your hips through just to squeeze in PERIOD I think we found three bras that night recalled Adam PERIOD Right Von

Two definitely he replied PERIOD One was morelingerie. it wasnt just the heat of the dance floor that made those clothes come off.VonTravispointed out that while some songs are good they are not for clubs PERIOD They get the  slot  the first batch is always girls PERIOD Thats when you crank Last Friday Night so they can pound their brewsin. according to VT the night breaks down in chunks From  p.m PERIOD to midnight they spin remixes and slower songs and then until  a.m PERIOD they hold nothing back PERIOD Midnight is the axis on which the night spins PERIOD

Not too many songs without lyrics Adam advised PERIOD

When asked to play a song Adam pulled up Calvin Harriss Feel So Close the extended mix pressing play at exactly the  mark PERIOD Dank explained that the earliest he should begin that song is the  mark PERIOD You dont want to leave more than  seconds for buildup to the lyrics. eighteen man Ratchet interjected PERIOD

Unless a song is three minutes we dont want to play the whole thing Dank concluded PERIOD

Even within a song theres a method to remixing and interweaving the different genres and beats from the hook to the fadeout PERIOD Filter out switch it to the middle crank it down blend it out. vT spat out the instructions like ingredients on a grocery list PERIOD

Just how do they do it Traktor and genius Ratchet said PERIOD

Traktor is a program Dank explained to me referring to the digital turntable and software they use for loading mixing and transitioning between songs manufactured by the sound technology company Native Instruments PERIOD

And genius is us Ratchet added PERIOD

Each adds his own element to the lineup PERIOD VonTravis handles most of the rap and hiphop PERIOD He cites Wiz Khalifa as an inspiration because he is the perfect model of versatility with songs to chill to and songs to tear the club down to PERIOD I take what I be dummin to on the dance floor he added and replicate PERIOD Innovate. meanwhile Adam draws from festivals where he marvels at how one person controls the bodies of  participants swaying to the music PERIOD His idols include Daft Punk a French house duo whose poster hangs in his bedroom alongside Jimi Hendrix The Beatles Bob Marley Jim Morrison and Gorillaz PERIOD Adam primarily contributes dubstep and electrohouse though his personal favorites arent always what make it into the mix PERIOD Its all about the crowd having fun not you listening to your favorite music he said PERIOD

Catch them at The Guards if you happen to be thirsty this Thursday or the next few PERIOD On Dec PERIOD  the duo will be DJing a White Party for Christmas at The Guards PERIOD You will be dummin on the dance floor PERIOD
