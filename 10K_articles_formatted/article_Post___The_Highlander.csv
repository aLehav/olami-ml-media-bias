All last week April  RUSGA and the Office of Student Activities hosted the annual Ranger Week where activities from the Regis Talent and Drag Show to the Silent Disco were put on every night to give the students of Regis a chance to unwind and celebrate their accomplishments throughout the year PERIOD All of these events led up to the biggest event that RUSGA puts on and that is Ranger Day PERIOD

Despite some wet and snowy weather in the morning the Regis community came out in droves as food trucks and outdoor activities took over Lot  and the Beach PERIOD As students got to choose from a variety of food trucks serving tacos to Cajun food to ice cream there were a plethora of activities set up on the Beach from a zipline to an inflatable obstacle course to henna and a photo booth PERIOD Some lucky Rangers were even treated to free Tshirts and draw string backpacks commemorating the day PERIOD

This years Ranger Day was also the beginning for Regis new mascot PERIOD After a poll went around the Regis community to help name the new fox mascot the winner was Regi and Regi was out and about taking pictures with students and giving out little fox plushies PERIOD

As afternoon turned into night Ranger Day concluded with a concert in the Fieldhouse that was put on by Grammynominated rap artist Jidenna PERIOD All in all Ranger Week was themed around UR representing the statement that Regis can come together to celebrate what makes every person in this community unique and open to hearing the diverse stories of where everyone in our community has been and where they will be going in the future PERIOD
