Partly cloudy PERIOD Low 56F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The United States Supreme Court decided April  to not rule on
the antiterror law pushed through Congress by President Bush last
year PERIOD

This decision means that they will not rule on the
constitutionality of the antiterror law and will leave the
detainees to continue to have their rights to challenge their
confinement stripped away PERIOD

In a world that is currently disgusted by the actions of the
United States and its human rights violations it is unwise for the
highest court of justice in the United States to not start making
rulings on the constitutionality of the Guantanamo Bay prison PERIOD

As President Bush pushed his antiterror law last year he told
the nation he needed the new law to bring terror suspects to
justice PERIOD

Does President Bush know the meaning of justice It is evident
that this administration does not know the meaning of justice
because justice is equal PERIOD Both sides deserve and are allowed
justice PERIOD However information about Guantanamo Bay proves that
human rights violations prevail over justice there PERIOD

A military tribunal has been set up and the United States
government has stated it will use it to prosecute about  of the
 detainees PERIOD

First why is the United States government only looking at  of
the  cases These men are in the worst of conditions some of
which could be innocent and we want to let them rot in there PERIOD

It makes me wonder if the United States has enough proof that
all  men are terrorists or if it is just the  and the rest are
a publicity stunt to show the U.S PERIOD citizens the military has
cracked down on terrorism PERIOD

Second why are we to just jump to the word prosecute This
implies that they are and never have been innocent PERIOD There have been
numerous times throughout our world history where the innocent have
been convicted false blame has been bestowed on someone or acts
of protest have lead to imprisonment PERIOD

The last time I saw a picture of Guantanamo Bay there was an
American flag in the background PERIOD There is nothing proud about this
prison to be flying an American flag there PERIOD

Having the American flag fly proudly on this camp of human
rights violations just proves to the rest of the world that we do
not care and we are proud of it PERIOD

It is time to get involved and tell the world the rest of
America does not support the human rights violations of this
administration PERIOD
