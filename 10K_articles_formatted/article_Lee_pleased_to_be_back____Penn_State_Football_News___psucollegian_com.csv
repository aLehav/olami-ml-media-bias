656,1970-01-01,"forgive Sean Lee if his hair gets caught in his helmet or his mouthpiece causes his lips to chap PERIOD It has after all been almost a year since he suited up for the Nittany Lions PERIOD

Lee was relegated to playercoach last fall after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament ACL during spring drills PERIOD But as Penn State opened spring camp last week the AllAmerica linebacker was back between the lines leading his teammates during an opening lap and stretching drills PERIOD

After months of rehab Lee said he is finally completely healthy and has not had any pain in his knee for more than a month PERIOD

 Lee said PERIOD 

While hes been cleared to practice this spring Lee will be held out of most contact drills PERIOD Coach Joe Paterno said its just a safety precaution and with an abundance of youthful talent at linebacker the coaching staff wants to get a feel for some of the younger linebackers PERIOD

Paterno said hes not exactly sure whether Lee will man the inside of the Lions defense or line up outside but added it doesnt matter because Paterno said Lee has enough athleticism to play any linebacker position and is even athletic enough to play safety PERIOD

 Paterno said PERIOD 

When the linebackers went through practice drills on Friday Lee was relegated to a backup role PERIOD Josh Hull Navorro Bowman and Mike Mauti practice as the first unit but Lee was quick to step in and correct his teammates if he saw them make a mistake PERIOD

That was one of the most difficult adjustments for Lee while he rehabbed PERIOD One of the more vocal leaders on the squad he said he didnt feel right barking at his teammates while he stood on the sidelines PERIOD But now that hes back to  percent Lee said hes back where he belongs on the field PERIOD

 Lee said PERIOD 

Of course Lee will be with them the whole time until live scrimmages then Paterno said Lee will be forced to watch again PERIOD But just because the coaching staff has told Lee he wont be involved in any contact drills until the fall doesnt mean hes going to take it easy this spring PERIOD And the veteran captain said hes going to find some way to sneak in some contact before the end of camp PERIOD

He is a football player after all and after compiling  career tackles its not natural for him to avoid contact PERIOD

 Lee said PERIOD
