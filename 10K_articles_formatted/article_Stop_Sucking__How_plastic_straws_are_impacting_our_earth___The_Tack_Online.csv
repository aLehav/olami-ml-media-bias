Before going to class on a Monday morning I usually find myself visiting the campus coffee shop PERIOD I order an iced vanilla latte served in a plastic cup with a plastic lid and a plastic straw PERIOD Not thinking much of it I carry on to my first class PERIOD

During my first class I finish my iced coffee PERIOD Its Monday morning and Im tired PERIOD So when I finish my coffee I find the nearest trash receptacle even if it is not a recyclable trash receptacle and toss my cup inside PERIOD For the rest of my day I think nothing of where my plastic cup plastic lid and plastic straw will end up PERIOD

Until now PERIOD

Did you know that eight million tons of plastic flow into our oceans each year Did you also know that eighty percent of the debris in our oceans comes from land Which means that its quite likely that my plastic cup plastic lid and plastic straw will end up in the ocean PERIOD

I recently spent a month in Mossel Bay South Africa PERIOD Mossel Bay is home to a wide array of sea life. seventyfive great white sharks over fourthousand cape fur seals numerous sea turtles and many other species of sea life reside there coping with the effects my plastic waste delivers to such a beautiful area PERIOD

While in South Africa I learned about how important it is to be aware of your plastic usage PERIOD I learned the hard way receiving endless teasing from peers something they called straw shaming. the town of Mossel Bay is located in the Western Cape right on the Indian Ocean PERIOD Due to the large sea life population in the area people and organizations in Mossel Bay have made it their duty to reduce their plastic usage PERIOD Restaurants in the town have taken measures to reduce usage and there are multiple campaigns to help make people more aware of their plastic usage PERIOD

Now you might be wondering why I am bringing this topic to light because in Iowa we are thousands of miles from the ocean PERIOD However in the United States alone there are  million plastic straws used on a daily basis PERIOD The United States contributes thirty percent to the eighty percent of debris in our oceans that comes from land PERIOD

While there are many ways to reduce your plastic usage one of the easiest ways is cutting straws out of your daily routine PERIOD You might be thinking that one small tube of plastic doesnt make much of an impact however if you think about how often you use plastic straws thats a very significant amount of plastic PERIOD

Straws are also very small which means they can easily get into the bodies of sea life PERIOD In  a video of scientists pulling a straw out of a sea turtles nose went viral PERIOD This has happened to hundreds of sea turtles all over the world PERIOD Straws can also end up in the bodies of other sea life species PERIOD Plastic straws are in the top ten most common things found in the bodies of sea creatures PERIOD

The use of straws is unnecessary PERIOD Anything you can drink with a straw you can drink without one PERIOD

Although if you still feel that its necessary to use straws there are other options available PERIOD Reusable straws made of hard plastic silicone and metal are a cheap and sustainable alternative PERIOD There have also been straws made of paper which are biodegradable PERIOD All of which can be found on Amazon PERIOD

So please PERIOD Stop Sucking PERIOD
