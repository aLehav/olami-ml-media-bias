The Massachusetts hockey team ended its regular season with a tough sweep from Boston College kicking it out of first place for the regular season in Hockey East standings PERIOD The Minutemen   HEA will look to redeem themselves against Providence College on Saturday night in their first playoff game of the season PERIOD

The Minutemen have done well against the Friars   HEA this year winning two of the three games played against them PERIOD But Providence posed a challenged to them in all three contests and the programs historically match up well against each other PERIOD

UMass coach Greg Carvel wants his players to go in with the same mindset of a regular season game PERIOD Each game the Minutemen play has meaning behind it but he knows heading into the game against Providence that if they lose to the Friars then that could be a season ending loss PERIOD

This is playoff hockey and weve got to rise we have to be better PERIOD The hope is to find a new level of play Carvel said PERIOD

In their first game against the Friars the lone goal in the game was defenseman Scott Morrows lamp lighter in the third period PERIOD The Minutemen did come back the next night with a more decisive win against the Friars  but in their most recent matchup they lost  in a difficult way PERIOD

Were thinking a lot about the last time we played Providence PERIOD They came in here and beat us  Ufko said PERIOD I think we scored and then after eight seconds they scored PERIOD That was late in the third period so they really stuck with us were all going to be thinking about that. a player that seems to know the Minutemen roster very well is Riley Duran PERIOD The Boston Bruins prospect scored both goals in UMass last matchup to send the Friars home with a win PERIOD Cody Monds was credited with an assist on both goals while also having a goal in his second matchup against the Minutemen PERIOD

UMass looks a lot different since the last time it faced Providence though PERIOD The Minutemen have seen a lot of positive change with scoring depth in their series but the Friars will still prove to be a tough matchup on Saturday PERIOD

Many of the Minutemen on the current roster have been in this position before with playing games in the playoffs some have gone to the Hockey East tournament multiple times PERIOD With so many older players on the UMass roster it gives the freshmen leaders to look up to heading into games that are higher stakes PERIOD

You just got to know that its win or lose PERIOD You got to be ready PERIOD Every shift counts Matthew Kessel said on his advice to younger players PERIOD

An area where Carvel wants to see improvement for the Minutemen is limiting mistakes in important shifts PERIOD In its series against BC UMass was outshooting the Eagles by a wide margin but the difference was that the Eagles were capitalizing on many of the Minutemens mistakes PERIOD

We try to be a very aggressive team but you cant cross the line from aggressive to reckless PERIOD Boston College scored the game winning goal because we were reckless Carvel said PERIOD Were on an offensive rush and the next you know its a 3on1 the other way and the pucks in the back of the net and the game is over. outside of film breakdowns and situational practices there is a simple way for UMass to clean up its mental mistakes and stop giving up odd man rushes according to its defensemen PERIOD

We just need to read off of each other better Morrow said PERIOD We play an aggressive system PERIOD At the end of the day if one person is off the page then that kind of screws up the reads for everybody else PERIOD So we just need to play with some unity and some togetherness to make sure those mistakes dont happen. the Minutemen will have home ice advantage at the Mullins Center against Providence on March  PERIOD Puck drop will be at  p.m PERIOD
