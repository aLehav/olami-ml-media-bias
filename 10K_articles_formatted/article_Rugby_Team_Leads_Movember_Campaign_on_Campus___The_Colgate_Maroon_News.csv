It wasnt until early January after being bribed by his family that senior Julian Michaels finally shaved off his mustache PERIOD Michaels was just one of several Colgate students who sported mustaches during the month of November in order to spread awareness and raise money for Prostate and Testicular Cancer PERIOD This rapidly growing movement takes the idea of NoShave November and uses it as a global health effort PERIOD Its called Movember and the organization raised  million last year alone PERIOD

The idea started in Melbourne Australia in  and the movement has spread to the US the UK Canada New Zealand Ireland Spain South Africa the Netherlands and Finland PERIOD Mo Bros those growing mustaches register at Movember.com and receive donations from friends and family on the site PERIOD Movember United States uses these donations to benefit the Prostate Cancer Foundation PCF and LIVESTRONG the Lance Armstrong Foundation PERIOD

Mo Bros start on November  clean shaven and grow and style their mustache for the rest of the month spreading awareness and raising money along the way PERIOD And while its only men that can grow the mustaches many women also play a large role by helping to recruit others and raise funds PERIOD

Prostate cancer affects  in  men worldwide and testicular cancer is the most common form of cancer affecting men ages  to  PERIOD

Last year at Colgate members of the mens rugby team and Sigma Chi raised over  PERIOD

The mens rugby team prides itself on philanthropy and community involvement senior and mens rugby team captain Michael Danahy said but Movember means a lot more to us than most projects PERIOD Each year I am pleasantly surprised by the support that our student body shows for this fight but Im unpleasantly surprised by how many of our students have been affected by the disease in one way or another. both Michaels and Danahy have family members who have been affected by cancer which led them to become involved with Movember United States PERIOD

Once my dad told me about our family history with the cancer Michaels said I took the cause a lot more seriously and put in a lot of effort to raise money invite people to the team and of course grow a great mustache PERIOD Its a real conversation starter when someone has a fumanchu. a member of Phi Delta Theta Phi Delta and the rugby team was diagnosed with Mediastinal Germ Cell Tumor cancer over winter break PERIOD

The importance of this fight has taken on new significance to Colgate Rugby as one of our teammates has moved his ferocity and tenacity from the rugby pitch into his own battle with cancer Danahy said PERIOD The mens rugby team along with Phi Delta has shifted its focus to aiding their friend in his battle against cancer by defraying some of the expenses for his family PERIOD

Michaels and Danahy will both be graduating in the spring but as Michaels says As long as there are kids on the Colgate Still Reds Rugby Club the Colgate Mos will live on. lectures
