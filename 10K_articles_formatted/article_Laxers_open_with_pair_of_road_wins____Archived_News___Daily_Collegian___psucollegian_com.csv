The mens lacrosse team opened its season with two respectable victories as it rumbled through North Carolina like a tropical storm this Spring Break breezing past Division III teams Guilford  and Roanoke  PERIOD

For the Lions this trip marked a few firsts PERIOD It was the first time Penn State would meet both Guilford and Roanoke and it was the first time the team could test its rebuilt defense and new starting goalie PERIOD It was a test that both passed with flying colors PERIOD

 junior Chris Dent said PERIOD We played well but gave up eleven goals so when we went into the second game Roanoke we just wanted to keep them from scoring.There were a lot of question marks defensively and in the goalBut the defense played a great game PERIOD We have an outstanding offense and knew we could score PERIOD



A potent Penn State offense dominated both games amassing  goals at Guilford and  at Roanoke PERIOD The impressive stickwielding of both Scott Mckeon and Dent led the Lion offense to early and solid leads throughout both games PERIOD

Even though Guilford and Roanoke are Division III schools they have proved time and again that they have the power to play with the Division I big boys PERIOD Midfielder Rich Makover explained that both teams are tops in their leagues and have the capacity to give any team a run for the money PERIOD

 Makover said PERIOD

The Lions proved that they had depth in the goal as well as on the field after a referee dismissed Robertson from the game with three seconds left in the first half of the Guilford game PERIOD In came secondstring goalie Brian Trapini who set a fine example by warding off threats to the Penn State cage while allowing only two goals throughout the entire second half PERIOD
