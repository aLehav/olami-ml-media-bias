Heather VanHoegarden  Monday November  

Ten thousand people flocked to the Joyce Center this weekend and it wasnt to see the basketball team  it was to see the volleyball team PERIOD

A record crowd of  saw the No PERIOD  Irish defeat Virginia Tech Friday and a crowd of  witnessed a  sweep of Miami Sunday night PERIOD

The Irish   in the Big East squeaked by the Hokies on Friday after falling behind  PERIOD The Irish took the Hokies to five games      before pulling out the victory with a Lauren Brewster kill to end game five PERIOD

We knew that we needed to play well this weekend and on Friday we were really pleased with game four and five Irish coach Debbie Brown said PERIOD

The Irish were able to come away from the match with some of their most consistent hitting numbers of the season  a . attack percentage for the match PERIOD Setter Kristen Kinder ran the offense with her career high  assists leading the team to a blazing . hitting percentage in the first game PERIOD

Kinder found targets in her middle blockers Brewster and Lauren Kelbley who both had  kills on a combined . hitting percentage PERIOD Emily Loomis added  kills to go along with a careerhigh  digs  her eleventh doubledouble of her career PERIOD Jessica Kinder added  kills and  digs for her own doubledouble PERIOD

Defensively libero Meg Henican registered  digs while Danielle Herndon added  to go along with a career high three aces PERIOD

Although Fridays victory came as a sigh of relief Sunday was a new day and a new story against Miami   PERIOD The Irish swept the Hurricanes on College Sports Television     PERIOD

The Irish came out strong posting a . hitting percentage in the first game and holding the Hurricanes to only . hitting PERIOD The game was tied at  when the Irish went on a  run to finish the game on Kelbleys kill PERIOD

I think that weve had the capability sometimes to pull away at the end of a match Brown said PERIOD I think that we got in a better rhythm and we just started getting better timing on the block and we finished better offensively at the end of the first game. the second game saw the Irish fall behind early but they fought back after Loomis and Kelbley kills brought them back to  PERIOD Katie Neffs solo block put them ahead for good  PERIOD Kristen Kinder once again led the offense with  assists on the match PERIOD

However the first two games saw the Irish make nine service errors an unusual statistic for a consistentserving team PERIOD

It killed the coaches Brown said with a smile PERIOD We wanted to serve tough but we were trying to get aces instead of just trying to serve tough in the court. but in the end the Irish were just too much for the Hurricanes PERIOD Game three saw Notre Dame pull ahead for good as they got ahead  and never trailed PERIOD

By the end of the match we had a really good feel for what they were doing and we could respond a little bit better Brown said PERIOD

The team victory could be attributed to the passing of the Irish defense PERIOD Libero Meg Henican led the way with  digs and Emily Loomis added  PERIOD

They were the key to the . hitting percentage of the Irish who had four players with nine kills or more PERIOD Kelbley led the way with  followed by Loomis with  PERIOD Jessica Kinder and Neff both playing their last regular season games in the Joyce Center added nine each PERIOD

We played three really solid games today Brown said PERIOD Its exactly where we want to be. share This Story

Through three tournaments this fall the Irish have struggled to build on last seasons.. PERIOD
