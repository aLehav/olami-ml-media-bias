When I first heard about the recent passage of the Military Commissions Act I was When I first heard about the recent passage of the Military Commissions Act I was distraught PERIOD Actually thats an understatement PERIOD I was very close to tears PERIOD Dont laugh PERIOD Its not like Im usually this hysterical when it comes to laws I dont agree with PERIOD Its just that this law goes against everything America stands for and completely ignores the values set forth by our founding fathers PERIOD As soon as President Bush put pen to paper I felt as though I was watching our U.S PERIOD Constitution being torn to shreds PERIOD

The Military Commissions Act gives the U.S PERIOD president the unconstitutional and unprecedented power to indefinitely detain anyone he deems as an enemy combatant  U.S PERIOD citizen or not PERIOD It strips alien prisoners of the right of habeas corpus or the right to know the charges against them thus ignoring this provision of the Geneva Conventions PERIOD It accepts the use of secret evidence and coerced evidence or testimonies that are acquired through torture in military commissions trials PERIOD And it grants U.S PERIOD officials immunity from prosecution for torturing prisoners PERIOD

And American citizens are not exempt from these unjust provisions PERIOD Yaser Esam Hamdi a U.S PERIOD citizen was named an illegal enemy combatant and detained to Guantanamo Bay PERIOD Another U.S PERIOD citizen Jose Padilla was detained as an unlawful enemy combatant and held in prison for three years before he heard the charges against him PERIOD In fact author and attorney Glenn Greenwald even referred to the Military Commissions Act as the legalization of the Jose Padilla Treatment. but dont worry the law is sure to help us win the War on Democracy  oh excuse me  the War on Terror PERIOD

Okay so obviously Im still a little angry PERIOD After all the law basically disregards the values enshrined in this nation for more than  years PERIOD It can singlehandedly wipe out half of the Bill of Rights PERIOD And it puts us in the hypocritical situation of trying to instill and encourage democracy in foreign countries while our own rights and liberties are being stifled here at home PERIOD But instead of getting all fired up and emotional about how our rights are being stepped on and they are or about how our president is overstepping his authority and he is I think Im going to look at this law a little more rationally PERIOD

Although Im no fan of sacrificing our rights for the false hope of making America safer from terrorism maybe its for the better PERIOD When a democracy is challenged and restricted it tends to become stronger PERIOD When a right or a freedom is taken away people start to realize its worth and no longer take it for granted PERIOD This encourages greater public participation in political discourse and involves more people in the political process PERIOD Because what motivates people to get out there and vote more than an unjust law

Dont believe me Just look at Americas history PERIOD Its riddled with unconstitutional laws that have come and gone with little to no damage to our democracy PERIOD Take President John Adams Alien and Sedition Acts which made it illegal to publish scandalous writing and allowed the deportation of dangerous aliens PERIOD This law was extremely opposed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison who sought to inform the public about its constitutional violations PERIOD In fact they succeeded in drafting resolutions that called on the states to abolish the act PERIOD

Also the Military Commissions Act isnt the first time a law has lifted habeas corpus PERIOD Thats right President Abraham Lincoln sacrificed it during the Civil War but sure enough it came back soon thereafter PERIOD And how about President Woodrow Wilsons  Sedition Act which restricted any speech that was believed to be a threat to an American victory in World War I PERIOD This act barely lasted a few years PERIOD What Im trying to say is that unconstitutional laws simply cannot survive in strong democracies because once they challenge the democracy the public is sure to challenge them right back PERIOD And the ability to hold the government accountable for its actions is a sure sign of a resilient democracy PERIOD

Furthermore it is clear that government encroachment upon freedom is a trend that often comes up during times of war PERIOD While this is no doubt unsettling it is also strangely reassuring PERIOD Its somewhat relieving to view the Military Commissions Act as another hasty and illthoughtout war response that is sure to disappear in a few years PERIOD

So I guess Im no longer as hysterical as I was on the morning of Oct PERIOD  when President Bush signed the Military Commissions Act into law PERIOD As much as it pains me to see rights and liberties disregarded I suppose its not that bad PERIOD Who knows This act could be a significant test for Americas democracy PERIOD It could even be a significant test for the American people PERIOD And if were lucky it wont last any longer than the two years left of Bushs term in office PERIOD
