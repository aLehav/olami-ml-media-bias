Courtney Becker  Friday October  

There are several destination locations on Notre Dames campus during a home football weekend including Notre Dame Stadium the Grotto and the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore that are a priorityfor any visiting home or away fans interested in buying Notre Dame merchandise PERIOD Director of the Hammes Bookstore retail operations David Werda said this demand can increase the bookstores productivity by as much as  percent PERIOD

During a home football weekend we are in the neighborhood of  to  transactions per hour Werda said PERIOD On a nonfootball weekend  lets just say the Saturday of fall break  it could be as few as  transactions in the entire day PERIOD We move upward of  units of merchandise on a football Saturday alone. werda said the bookstore measures these statistics starting as early as Wednesday of a home football week due to the number of fans who arrive on campus early in the week PERIOD

A football weekend for us is really defined as Wednesday through Sunday he said PERIOD Whats really interesting about Notre Dame and Notre Dame fans and the opponents that Notre Dame play is they all travel really well to South Bend PERIOD  It is not unlikely for us to see fans from an opposing team or Notre Dame fans from an opposing teams town as early as Wednesday. dashelle Angel a cashier at the bookstore said the number of people in the bookstore at peak times during a football weekend can make it difficult to help every customer in a timely manner a priority for the bookstore staff PERIOD

Its very hectic here Angel said PERIOD The most challenging part is trying to get to every customer and thats the No. rule here PERIOD Get every customer and make them satisfied by just getting their order right. part of getting a customers order right involves having every size of clothing and other types of merchandise available at all times which Werda said the bookstore management ensures by carefully planning the flow of merchandise into the bookstore well in advance of the football season PERIOD

Were selling a lot of merchandise so the flow of merchandise into the Notre Dame retail operations  is planned over a year in advance he said PERIOD Our team of buyers and planners procure products from those vendors  right now were already looking at fall of  PERIOD  Were starting to plan the flow of that merchandise into the store because that product is cut and sown its decorated and so its not just a pointandclick order there are a lot of moving parts and pieces. werda said factors such as the football schedule itself could affect how much product the bookstore receives during a certain month PERIOD

If you think about this season in particular where we had three home games backtobacktoback in the month of September theres no time in between those games to flow product into the store for a game so that product needs to be landed in advance of those games Werda said PERIOD The month of August for example becomes a very critical month for us as we bring product in from various vendors. one other important aspect of a football weekend the bookstore management keeps in mind is the movement of crowds in the bookstore Werda said PERIOD

We spend a great deal of time talking about the flow of people through the building he said PERIOD Much like going to the Grotto and going to see Touchdown Jesus and going to the stadium itself the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore is very much a part of that experience and so we move a lot of people through the bookstore. werda said the bookstore management controls this by specifically placing popular products such as The Shirt in areas where they will benefit the flow of traffic rather than impeding movement PERIOD

Anything and everything in the bookstore  can alter the direction of traffic and the flow of people he said PERIOD At this point The Shirt has become something where people are coming to get The Shirt PERIOD Its part of the game day experience PERIOD Placement of The Shirt  often presents a problem because so many people want The Shirt that at times it causes congestion. the bookstores busier moments during football weekends vary due to factors such as opponent game time and weather Werda said but the business consistently sees peak crowds just a few hours before kickoff PERIOD

When theres a West Coast crowd that comes in the day tends to shift later because of the fact that theyre a West Coast crowd arriving later in the day and because of the time change theyre thinking that its earlier for them Werda said PERIOD Generally speaking the three hours before a game are our peak time PERIOD  Day games differ greatly from night games and weather impacts everything significantly. despite all the necessary components of stocking merchandise and managing crowds Werda said the most important aspect of being prepared for a home football game is making sure there are enough staff members to help bookstore customers PERIOD

The people piece of it is probably the biggest one in terms of staffing he said PERIOD We start hiring for seasonal positions well in advance  in order for us to execute the  to  transactions per hour on a football weekend. angel said she and the other Hammes Bookstore cashiers do everything they can to make a fans experience at the bookstore enjoyable PERIOD

We try to carry on conversations try to get to learn more about them and have them come back she said PERIOD Here we are family and we want that to keep going and we dont want any bad reviews at all PERIOD  Just come visit us because we love the atmosphere of people. werda said this attitude stems from the bookstore staffs desire to enhance the Notre Dame experience for any fans visiting campus PERIOD

The Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore isnt just a regular retail store he said PERIOD Its more than just selling products its about providing an experience PERIOD Were not just training people on how to run a register or how to stock a sales floor were training people on how to provide that true Notre Dame experience to those guests that are traveling from all over the country to a game. not only does the bookstore staff work hard to ensure fans have a good visit to the bookstore but Angel has also discovered these experiences can be just as enjoyable for the bookstore staff as they are for customers PERIOD

Jon Bon Jovis son went here and I actually met Bon Jovi she said PERIOD Im a fangirl of Jon Bon Jovi PERIOD I literally passed out and they woke me up and I said Can I get an autograph
