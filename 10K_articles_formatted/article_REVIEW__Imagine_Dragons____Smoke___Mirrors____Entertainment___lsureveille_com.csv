Three years following its debut Imagine Dragons released its second studio album this past Tuesday titled Smoke  Mirrors. the band promoted the upcoming release with a live Target commercial during the Grammys which wasnt the best marketing scheme it could have come up with PERIOD

The band has been under a lot of pressure following the widespread success that its first album Night Visions garnered in  PERIOD Two of its singles were featured in popular movies released the same year PERIOD

Its Time was featured in The Perks of Being A Wallflower and was the bands first commercially successful song PERIOD Afterward Radioactive was featured in The Host and added to the widespread media attention PERIOD

Overall the record is deeply emotional which brings fans closer to the music PERIOD

The album begins with Shots the first single from the record PERIOD Dont get too excited as it bears little resemblance to the Lil Jon song we all know by the same title PERIOD

Quite the opposite of a party anthem this song is an upbeat melody serving as a metaphor for shooting the things lead singer Dan Reynolds loves PERIOD Its an apology for continuing to mess up a relationship he either was or is in PERIOD

By the time we get to the fourth track Im So Sorry we get to see hints of experimentation with the bands sound PERIOD The song is similar to one heard in the background of an actionpacked movie trailer or TV show PERIOD

Halfway through the album is Friction a song which truly stands out from the other tracks PERIOD The guitar plucking is reminiscent of Missy Elliots Get Ur Freak On. reynolds has publicly discussed his recent bout with depression and how it affected the process of making the album PERIOD This is evident on the final track The Fall. the singer pens the lyrics Maybe Im destined to be distraughtalways a reason breaking me down to my knees in the dead of night. the album also makes several references to gold and letting go which is personified by the album art PERIOD The cover features hands bound together by gold ribbon setting a hummingbird free PERIOD

These references can be found in the tracks Gold and The Fall where Reynolds sings Who can you trust when everything you touch turns to gold and Wait for the colors to turn to gold respectively PERIOD

If the bands infamous style of heavy synthesizers and guitars was what drew initial listeners theres good news Smoke  Mirrors is the same concept PERIOD

There isnt much of a difference stylistically between the albums which could either mean Imagine Dragons wanted to stay true to this style in a world where music is becoming more blas or it isnt brave enough to truly experiment with their sound PERIOD

Throughout the album there are occasional style nuances present which give way to a deeper side of the band we havent seen PERIOD Perhaps if Smoke  Mirrors is successful enough to lead to a third album we will hear more of that PERIOD

Whatever the reason fans can rest easy knowing theres a new album full of the familiar sounds theyve been holding on to PERIOD
