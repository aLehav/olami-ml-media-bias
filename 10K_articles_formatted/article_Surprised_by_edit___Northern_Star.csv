May  

I was surprised by your editorial on the Waco standoff PERIOD A brief history lesson on the FBI

In  the FBI had no problems killing innocent American citizens in their relentless attempt to bring down John Dillinger PERIOD In the 1960s the FBI cranked up a domestic spy operation that wiretapped Dr PERIOD Martin Luther King the NAACP VISTA volunteers the Better Government Association and a variety of church and antiwar groups which used dangerous tactics causing deaths family breakups and injuries and totally disregarded the rights of American citizens not to mention the deaths of scores of people and the false imprisonment of many more PERIOD Their overuse of deadly force their instigation of violent acts by others got them censored by the U.S PERIOD Congresswhich clearly did not condone their undemocratic actions PERIOD See the Senate Report  Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans Senator Frank Church Chairman PERIOD

Then there was the 1970s and their war on the American Indian Movement AIM at Wounded Knee South Dakota PERIOD Again violent and again getting innocent people killed PERIOD

The point is who is to blame in the Waco standoff is very important PERIOD The FBI has been censored over and over for its utter disregard for the lives of innocent people and the rights of Americans simply because they are involved in an unpopular activity PERIOD Lets look at the facts

There was a group in Waco that was storing guns granted PERIOD Thats not necessarily a violation of the law PERIOD They had been identified as a cult by the press PERIOD I never heard them call themselves that PERIOD I assume people will behave rationally unless they prove otherwise PERIOD Now then this group of people was in a standoff with law enforcement PERIOD My first thought is they were afraid to surrender PERIOD Why Maybe because they shot some law enforcement people and were afraid to face the consequences PERIOD Or maybe the law came in shooting PERIOD I dont know PERIOD Then they reportedly all burn themselves to death Are we suppose to believe that Even psychotic people fear fire PERIOD And given the FBIs past history I want to know what happened and I think everyone should want to know PERIOD Not to investigate this previously undemocratic agency which claims to have reformed would be ludicrous PERIOD
