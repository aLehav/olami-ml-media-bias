Its inevitable  once you start classes youre going to be crunched for both time and cash PERIOD And since youre not looking to order all your meals from McDonalds Dollar Menu at least I hope youre not youll need a plan PERIOD Otherwise youll find yourself deciding how to make a halfeaten bag of Doritos and minimarshmallows into a balanced meal at  p.m PERIOD on a Tuesday night PERIOD Been there done that PERIOD

 PERIOD Stop buying bottled water PERIOD

I know its tempting especially in 100plus degree weather in the middle of August PERIOD But honestly bottled water is more marketing than anything else PERIOD Purchase a reusable container that you can fill up PERIOD I prefer the clear acrylic type that comes with a removable straw PERIOD At night stick it in the freezer and fill it up with icecold water before heading out in the morning PERIOD Refill at one of the many water fountains on campus or if youre off campus make a pit stop at a nearby convenience store and fill up near the fountain drink area PERIOD Some places may charge you a small refill fee about  cents or so but it sure beats the . youd pay for  ounces of water in a bottle PERIOD

.Plan meals PERIOD

It goes without saying but Ill say it youre going to be tired and not feel like cooking PERIOD Thats when its most tempting to take a trip to Burger King for your grub PERIOD And dont even think about socalled healthy frozen dinners PERIOD Those entrees are filled with sodium and are really expensive PERIOD Instead make your own microwaveable dinners by cooking meals in advance dividing them into individual storage containers and freezing them PERIOD When youre hungry grab one of your homemade dinners and pop it into the microwave PERIOD It may be beneficial to make a weeks worth of meals at a time like on a Sunday in between studying PERIOD You can even purchase an insulated lunch bag and take your meals with you and heat them up in the microwaves located in commons areas on campus PERIOD

 PERIOD Go frozen PERIOD

Fruits and veggies are super important for good nutrition but a trip to the produce department can wreak havoc on your wallet PERIOD Opt for frozen fruits and vegetables instead which are about half the cost of fresh and still good for you PERIOD Plus frozen fruits and vegetables come washed and cut making preparation ohsosimple PERIOD And dont think frozen means less variety PERIOD Brands like Birds Eye and Green Giant have come up with some truly great combinations of vegetables that taste yummy PERIOD With that said fresh apples and oranges are not too expensive and are still the most convenient for a quick grabandgo snack PERIOD Buy these fruits in the bulk bags for even bigger savings PERIOD

 PERIOD Buy store brands PERIOD

It may seem like a nobrainer but store brands are often although not always less expensive than commercial brands PERIOD And most of the time the taste difference is minimal PERIOD Especially for products such as cereal eggs milk and bread store brands are the way to go for significant savings PERIOD Also many stores like Bakers and HyVee will offer additional discounts for buying more store brands such as Bakers  for  sales PERIOD There are some products that just cant be substituted with a store brand and these are often based on individual preferences PERIOD Personally I cant replace Kraft Macaroni  Cheese with a store brand box PERIOD Ill pay the extra quarter to get the brand I like PERIOD

 PERIOD Watch store ads PERIOD

Dont drive all around Omaha from store to store in order to get the best deal on sale items PERIOD The price of gas trumps any savings youd yield during your journey PERIOD Luckily there are stores such as No Frills Supermarket that will price match other stores PERIOD For example if Hidden Valley salad dressing is on sale for . at Bakers No Frills will sell it to you for that price too as long as you show the ad to the No Frills cashier PERIOD This way you save gas money but are still able to get the same deals you would if you went from store to store PERIOD
