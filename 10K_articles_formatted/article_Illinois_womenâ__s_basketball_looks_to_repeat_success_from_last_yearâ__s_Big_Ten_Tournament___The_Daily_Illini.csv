Its March Madness Law said PERIOD If we go hard for  minutes we get to play another day PERIOD If we dont go hard for  minutes we dont have to say Oh we can do it next week. our season is over PERIOD And I dont think my kids are ready for it to be over. laws winning percentage is sixth best in the tournaments 17year history and is third among active coaches behind Ohio States Jim Foster and Purdues Sharon Versyp both of whom have won Big Ben Tournament titles PERIOD



I try to put every season in perspective Law said PERIOD

Nonconference is you know as they say your quizzes PERIOD Big Ten is your midterms PERIOD Heres the final PERIOD Well see how well weve done what weve learned over the years in the Big Ten Tournament. this years Illini are playing better down the stretch  they won five of their last nine games after an  conference start PERIOD

Illinois has played really well as of late Michigan head coach Kevin Borseth said PERIOD Playing good at the end of the year is what its all about PERIOD  Our conference is so competitive from top to bottom PERIOD You dont really know from one game to the next whos going to beat who. no PERIOD  seeds are  in round one of the tournament but if last season is any indication history wont be a factor for Illinois PERIOD The Illini became the first No PERIOD  seed to advance to the semifinals knocking out No PERIOD  Wisconsin and No PERIOD  Michigan along the way PERIOD

We havent really said much about last year Adrienne GodBold said PERIOD We know what we did last year and of course thats in the back of our heads but its a new year and everybody got a new team new players PERIOD Everybody is capable of different things. the Wolverines took the first matchup against Illinois on Dec PERIOD  with a  victory in Ann Arbor Mich PERIOD The Illini watched film of that loss Wednesday morning and GodBold said it was as if they were watching a different team PERIOD

Its like black and white GodBold said PERIOD We know that theyre beatable and we know that we can beat them PERIOD With the focus that we had today in practice and what we did yesterday were gonna bring it hard tomorrow. illinois and Michigan will play for a secondround date with nationally ranked No PERIOD  Ohio State at  a.m PERIOD Thursday a time that mimics the Illinis early morning practice schedule PERIOD

This is what we do Law said PERIOD It shouldnt be an adjustment at all PERIOD  Instead of practicing for two and a half two hours were playing  minutes PERIOD It shouldnt be an adjustment for us because were used to it.",Illinois womenâ€™s basketball looks to repeat success from last yearâ€™s Big Ten Tournament - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
