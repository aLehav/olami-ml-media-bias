NIUs plans to purchase the former Wurlitzer Corp PERIOD property were shattered Wednesday despite a funding offer from the DeKalb City Council when the property owners said they probably will not extend the deadline for NIUs purchase decision PERIOD

In a meeting Wednesday representatives from the property owners parent corporation Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc. indicated they will give NIU an official answer today about extending the purchase deadline for two weeks said Thomas Montiegel NIU vice president of development and university relations PERIOD But the answer will probably be no. they Equitable are not going to give us an extension Montiegel said PERIOD We probably will not be able to purchase Wurlitzer PERIOD They represent a business and they have given us every opportunity but we just could not do it PERIOD It is a terrible loss. representatives from Equitable Real Estate of which Equitable Life Assurance Society the owner of the Wurlitzer Corp. is a subsidiary were not available for comment Wednesday evening PERIOD

NIU had planned to use the property in establishing a research and engineering park in which businesses could lease office space or limited industrial space PERIOD

The original July  purchase deadline was extended to Aug PERIOD  PERIOD Since this deadline has passed Equitable can allow other businesses to buy the corporation PERIOD

There is an interest by others in the purchase of Wurlitzer said Jim McCowen spokesperson for Equitable Real Estate PERIOD We do have a commitment to the university but we are not going to make a statement saying we prefer this buyer over another one. nIU raised  of the  purchase price PERIOD However Gov PERIOD James Thompson vetoed a bill that would have funded an estimated . million for purchase and renovation of the site PERIOD Consequently NIU was unable to provide additional funding for operations and maintenance of the property Montiegel said PERIOD

We just cannot buy it Wurlitzer and figure out how were going to cut the grass and heat the building Montiegel said PERIOD

NIU had received support from the city and from private citizens for the property purchase PERIOD

The DeKalb City Council decided Monday to fund the purchase of Wurlitzer possibly buying the property and selling it to NIU DeKalb Mayor Greg Sparrow said PERIOD

We are willing to provide funding up to and including the acquisition cost subject to negotiation Sparrow said PERIOD We do not want to become the owners PERIOD The idea is to assist NIU in bringing Wurlitzer to DeKalb. the council agreed the concept of a research park is beneficial to the community and represents the type of economic development it wants to encourage Sparrow said PERIOD

At the councils direction DeKalb City Manager Mark Stevens wrote letters to NIU President John LaTourette and Mike Tozzi vice president of Equitable Real Estate offering economic support for NIUs purchase of Wurlitzer PERIOD
