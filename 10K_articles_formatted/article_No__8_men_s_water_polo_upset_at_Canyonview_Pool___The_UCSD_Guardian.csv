6200,2023-10-08,"in his final regularseason match at Canyonview Pool UCSD senior captain Nate Cooper was honored on Nov PERIOD  at Senior Night as the only graduating player on the No PERIOD  Tritons mens water polo team PERIOD Then as if to make a final impression on the  fans in attendance for the match against No PERIOD  Pepperdine he led the Tritons offense with a pair of goals PERIOD However the effort was not enough to prevent the visiting Waves from upsetting UCSD  PERIOD

The match opened with a  shutout first period in the Tritons favor PERIOD Cooper scored his first late in the quarter as Pepperdine struggled to get its offense fired up PERIOD Unfortunately for UCSD this did not last beyond the first seven minutes of play PERIOD The Waves freshman drivers Adam Hewko and Grant Miller tallied backtoback goals within two minutes of the start of the second quarter giving their team the  advantage PERIOD But in a quarter that saw six total goals which knotted the score three times both teams offenses were just getting warmed up PERIOD

Triton freshman driver Adnan Jerkovic netted his only score of the game with four minutes  seconds to play in the half but it took only  seconds before Pepperdine sophomore Doug Mann stole the lead back away from the Tritons PERIOD

Cooper fired in his second goal of the match just inside the threeminute mark to keep the scoring advantage neutral going into the half but Pepperdine retaliated swiftly again taking just  seconds to surmount the Triton defense as senior driver Josh Acosta delivered the final score going into the half to maintain a  advantage over UCSD PERIOD

The Waves got on the board first in the second half as Acosta dropped his second goal of the game into the back of the net in the third minute PERIOD With a twogoal buffer and the clock slowly working its way down Pepperdine appeared to try to slow the tempo of its own offense in order to reduce the number of Triton scoring opportunities PERIOD The strategy was successful for the better part of the quarter until UCSD freshman twometer man Simon Schafer delivered his only goal of the match from the hole with only  to play PERIOD

From the start of the fourth quarter the Tritons knew that to win the game and avoid a crushing upset  the teams fourth consecutive loss and seventh of its last  chances  they would need to outscore Pepperdine by one goal to send the game into overtime or two for the win PERIOD

Sophomore utility Jesse Casellini started the Triton drive with the gametying score less than two minutes into the quarter PERIOD But Pepperdine shot back almost instantly wasting only  seconds before avenging Casellinis goal on a shot by Miller PERIOD

The game was sealed in the Waves favor at the  mark as Miller drove in his gamehigh third score and secured a  victory PERIOD

With the loss UCSD falls to  on the season PERIOD The Tritons who struggled at their home pool late in  will take the next two weeks to recuperate and finetune their skills in anticipation of the the Western Water Polo Association Championships which will determine whether the team will earn a berth in the NCAA Final Four Championship at Stanford on Dec PERIOD  and Dec PERIOD  PERIOD
