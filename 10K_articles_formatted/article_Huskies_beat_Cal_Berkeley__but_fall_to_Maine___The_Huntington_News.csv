Its funny how some things turn out PERIOD

The Northeastern field hockey team ranked eighth in the nation crushed 15thranked UCalBerkeley on Friday night  but were upset by an upstart Maine team Sunday  in overtime PERIOD Coach Cheryl Murtagh said that there was an immense difference in her teams mental preparation between the two games PERIOD

Maine came out hyped up and they were on fire said Murtagh PERIOD They are a scrappy team PERIOD It was a disappointing loss PERIOD If we can be as consistent as we were against Cal then well be successful PERIOD We need to have the same mental toughness that Maine had. nU now  on the season and  in the America East lost for the first time to a conference opponent in eleven tries PERIOD The Huskies seemingly outplayed the Black Bears but they were now able to convert on their chances PERIOD Maine scored on the only two shots they took in the game PERIOD

We need to finish Murtagh said PERIOD We had  penalty corners and Maine only had four PERIOD Thats the kind of game field hockey is sometimes PERIOD We needed to put them away and we could have. mari Creatini put NU up  at halftime with an unassisted goal but Maines Rachel Hilgar answered with a tying goal in the second half off of an assist from Tara Bedard PERIOD With four minutes left in overtime Bedard ended it with a the gamewinning goal PERIOD NU outshot Maine  PERIOD

It was a completely different story against the Golden Bears of UCalBerkeley PERIOD Northeastern utterly dominated them on offense and defense and it looked as if the score could have been worse than  PERIOD

Teams will be looking to us as a team to beat said Broderick last week PERIOD We dont really care about that PERIOD We just want to win. murtagh said that the way they played against the Golden Bears is the way they should approach every game PERIOD

The Cal game was great she said PERIOD We played extremely well PERIOD Cal has a good offense and I think that we did a good job on them defensively PERIOD That was a great performance. nU controlled play from the beginning and UCalBerkeley never had a chance to get back into the game PERIOD Leigh Shea drove down field after  minutes of play and dumped the ball off to a wide open Liane Dixon PERIOD Dixon sent the shot into the cage for the goal and everything opened up from there PERIOD

For much of the first half the Golden Bears had a difficult time getting the ball past midfield as the NU defense swarmed all over them PERIOD NUs next goal came when Fior Arrindell sent a blast off of a rebound into the net PERIOD

After the goal things spiraled downward for the visitors PERIOD

The Huskies received two penalty corners right before halftime and they responded immediately PERIOD Shea set the ball up and Arrindell passed the ball to Dixon near the front of the goal PERIOD Dixon then scored an easy goal to go up  PERIOD

Broderick later scored on the next corner to give the Huskies an insurmountable  lead at halftime PERIOD

We know that we can score goals so we need to use that and make adjustments Murtagh said PERIOD We have to be prepared every game not just for big games. in the second half Maureen Connelly opened by breaking away from the Cal defense and put on the jets PERIOD She went untouched for a oneonone opportunity with the goalkeeper and slid the ball past her for another goal PERIOD Dixon would later score her third goal of the game to finish out the scoring PERIOD

NU outshot UCalBerkeley  and goalkeeper Emily Roy only had to make one save in yet another shutout for the Huskies PERIOD

We need to continue to be hungry for every game Broderick said PERIOD We want to do what we need to do to win PERIOD Any team can beat you on any given day but things will depend on the team attitude and work ethic. the Huskies return to action when they play on Saturday against New Hampshire at  p.m PERIOD

We need to regroup Murtagh said PERIOD Were going to get back to the fundamentals PERIOD We need to be confident but not overly so. the independent student newspaper of Northeastern University","Huskies beat Cal-Berkeley, but fall to Maine - The Huntington News",Northeastern University
