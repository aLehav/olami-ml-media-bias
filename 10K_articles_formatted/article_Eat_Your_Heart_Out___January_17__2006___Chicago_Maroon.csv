2223,2022-03-16,"now that winter has descended upon Chicago I have been yearning to spend more time in the kitchen cooking PERIOD Specifically I have been longing to cook warm gooey winter dishes like risotto or thick chunky soups PERIOD My Mary Poppinsesque saying for this quarter goes as follows A spoonful of butter helps the winter go down. i was in the kitchen last week with one of my roommates and we were debating what to make PERIOD I was tempted to bake from the book Paris Sweets by Dorie Greenspan which contains recipes from all of the best bakeries in Paris PERIOD Many of the recipes are rather laborious and complicated but there are some that are not too hard and dont require esoteric ingredients PERIOD What is nice about the book too is that it is organized by bakery PERIOD And of course having lived in Paris last year I have my favorite bakeryMaison Kayser PERIOD

A great distinction in France is between boulangeries bakeries and ptisseries pastry shops with the former specializing in bread and the latter in pastry PERIOD Technically speaking Maison Kayser is a boulangerie since its primary focus is on bread PERIOD But that does not mean that they are lacking in patisserie I know from empirical researchI have sampled nearly everything sold in the shop PERIOD So imagine my elation when I found an apple cake recipe in Paris Sweets from Maison Kayser My roommate and I set off to make the soft apple cake adapting it by discarding the raisins it called for and using vanilla bean paste for a more pronounced vanilla taste PERIOD

Did the cake result in a Proustian melodrama of me finding myself back at Maison Kayser The slices of apple were bound by a gooey vanilla cake and the hint of rum gave a burnt sugar taste to the batter PERIOD Piping hot and fresh out of the oven the cake almost resembled a pudding slumped on the plate as my roommates and I dug in for seconds PERIOD By morning it was all gone PERIOD
