Gabrielle Beechert  Monday April  

University of Hawaii astronomy professor Robert Jedicke discussed his involvement in the burgeoning asteroid mining industry during the fifth installment of the Ten Years Hence Life Beyond Earth lecture series Friday morning PERIOD

What we want to do is get water from the moon or from asteroids use the water to fuel the spacecraft which we then sell to customers Jedicke said PERIOD

Jedicke said he has been working with asteroids and comets for over  years PERIOD However he wasnt introduced to the asteroid mining industry until about  years ago PERIOD

The idea of asteroid mining was jumpstarted by a company called United Launch Alliance PERIOD Interested in the space industry the company said they would pay  per liter of water as long as that liter of water was in highearth orbit Jedicke said PERIOD

Now Jedicke works with the Trans Astronautica Corporation a vertically integrated asteroid mining technology development company. the companys goal is to participate in the space industry but Jedickes work with them specifically relates to mining asteroids for water PERIOD

But why is there such an interest in mining for water Water is highly abundant in our solar system PERIOD Not only is there water on the moon and Mars but Ceres  the largest known asteroid in the solar system  has more water than Earth Jedicke said PERIOD

Water also has many uses PERIOD Jedicke said it can serve as fuel a radiation shield for spacecraft and a resource for human consumption and agriculture PERIOD

But this does not mean that Jedicke and his colleagues can pick a random asteroid and start mining PERIOD There are specific criteria  location velocity size and classification  that optimize the mining process PERIOD

Out of the  million asteroids larger than half a mile in the asteroid belt about  of these are mining candidates Jedicke said PERIOD

The asteroids of interest are the Ctype asteroids that are about five to  meters in diameter PERIOD Jedicke said Ctype asteroids have the highest concentration of water about  PERIOD Although these asteroids exist primarily in the outer portion of the asteroid belt Jupiters gravity forces some of these asteroids within  million miles of Earth PERIOD This qualifies them as nearEarth objects NEOs meaning they are much easier to mine PERIOD

Once the mining is complete the water will not be brought back to earth PERIOD The extra mass of the water on the rocket would make it more difficult to return to Earth Jedicke said PERIOD

The water would instead be transported to a lunar gateway PERIOD This gateway would act as a gas station for water PERIOD

If were up there were actually using the water in space PERIOD That means we no longer have to come back down to Earth surfaces and leave again Jedicke said PERIOD We can start our missions in space and go to other asteroids we can go to other planets we can go to outer space stations. all of these considerations would be done with the help of the Sutter Ultra Systems PERIOD There will be three systems each with its own telescope that forms a triangulation system for identifying asteroid candidates as the systems orbit around the sun PERIOD Because the systems are in orbit before an asteroid is identified Jedicke said he hopes the mining system can be launched soon after the asteroids discovery PERIOD

We think it takes us about  days to characterize the asteroid well enough that we can actually decide that this is a viable mining target Jedicke said PERIOD We go to the target we spend maybe  to  days mining the target and extracting the water PERIOD Then we return to the EarthMoon system and we deliver water to customers in cislunar space and make a lot of money. jedicke said that current calculations estimate that they would be running two missions per year and those two missions would return a total of  tons of water PERIOD Although Jedicke did acknowledge that the uncertainty is  percent the oil rigs and exploration ships operating today were thought to be crazy  years ago PERIOD So it is important to have an open mind about the potential of asteroid mining PERIOD
