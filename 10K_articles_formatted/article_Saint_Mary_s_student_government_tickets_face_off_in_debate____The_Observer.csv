Marirose Osborne and Gabby Russell  Thursday February  

For the first time ever candidates running for president and vice president at Saint Marys College had a chance to debate each other instead of simply making speeches before a crowd PERIOD

Saint Marys interim president Nancy Nekvasil acted as moderator for the four candidates PERIOD The current president and vice president for the Saint Marys student body  seniors Madeleine Corcoran and Kathy Ogden  were also present for the debate PERIOD

The candidates  junior ticket Emma Schmidt president and Andrea RuizMontoya vice president and junior ticket Terra Nelson president and Olivia Allen vice president  were given two minuterounds to give introductions make closing remarks and answer questions from the crowd PERIOD

Five questions were submitted by graduate and undergraduate students at Saint Marys College PERIOD The questions included challengeson student diversity the Catholic faith and the future goals of the College PERIOD

Both tickets said they have plans to implement more diverse programs and create a space for diverse students to feel more comfortable PERIOD

We plan to implement a preview day for students of all minorities Nelson said PERIOD If youre passionate and excited you have a place at Saint Marys and we want you here. emphasizing the need for minority students to feel more at ease in choosing Saint Marys Schmidt and RuizMontoya said dialogue is important to make the College a better place for minority students PERIOD

Schmidt said we believe communication and collaboration is key in making students feel at home. a question was posed about how the candidates will strengthen the Catholic identity of the College PERIOD

In response Nelson said they wantto focus on the growth of Campus Ministry and to dive back into tradition PERIOD Nelson and Allen also said they wish to put a focus on nonCatholic backgrounds so that students of other faiths might feel more comfortable and at home at Saint Marys PERIOD

Nelson said approaching students when they first arrive on campus is vital to bringing them into the Catholic tradition PERIOD

A lot of freshmen who come to college may enter with a strong faith but they tend to turn away from it with the everyday busyness of college life she said PERIOD Its not really something that is talked about but I want to focus on it for the years to come. schmidt and RuizMontoya said they agreed with their opponents and raised another point about the Saint Marys identity PERIOD

We want to help students view Saint Marys as a place to grow as a woman in faith Schmidt said PERIOD

Looking toward the future of Saint Marys Nelson and Allen said they want to reconstruct freshman orientation with a new focus on sexual assault whileSchmidt and RuizMontoya said they want to put a new focus on campus security and mental health resources PERIOD

In order to make students feel safer on and off campus Schmidt and RuizMontoya said they are campaigning for two new policies PERIOD

We want to set up a mental health emergency line so that we can have oncall representatives to help students through crisis RuizMontoya said PERIOD We also want to have Blinkie run on Sundays because there are many students who go to Mass on Sundays at the Basilica and it can be hard to go over there especially during the winter months. although the candidates did agree on many points in some cases they emphasized their different views on the Saint Marys experience PERIOD

Nelson and Allen have worked within student government at Saint Marys including with the current student body president and vice president and Nelson said their experience with the Colleges governing bodies is analogous to that of a wedding caterer PERIOD

If you want someone to cater your wedding you want someone who has catered before she said PERIOD And metaphorically we have catered that wedding by previously being on student government. though Schmidt and RuizMontoya have not worked on student government before Schmidt said this allows them to understand the needs of normal students PERIOD

We give the perspective of a normal student having not been on SGA before she said PERIOD I believe that is our strength. several students were eager to share their perspectives on the debate following the event PERIOD

Saint Marys freshman Colleen Dunn said it was interesting to hear both sides PERIOD

I wasnt sure what to expect because Ive never seen a smaller debate like this Dunn said PERIOD I am happy with what I did see and I liked that both platforms focused on inclusivity. at the end of the night both campaigns left the students with their words of wisdom PERIOD

Schmidt said she knows even in the event of a win change will likely come slowly PERIOD

Its a marathon not a sprint she said PERIOD We understand that it will take time to have real change here at Saint Marys. nelson and Allen said they were glad to have the chance to improve the place they love so much PERIOD

We care about this college and we want to improve it Nelson said PERIOD

We have been a team from the beginning and we are humbled to represent our favorite place and second home Allen added PERIOD
