Wallace and Sapp should benefit from spending the second half of Wednesday nights win at the RAC resting on the bench PERIOD
Georgetown Head Coach John Thompson III said after the victory that he hopes Wallace will benefit from the half of rest he received against Rutgers PERIOD I wanted to see if once we got the lead got a cushion to see if the young guys could play and give those guys a rest. the young guys have certainly stepped up as of late as freshman DaJuan Summers led the team in scoring against Rutgers for the fifth time this season PERIOD Summers 17point tally was one shy of his career high that came earlier in the season against Towson PERIOD

Gonzalez current team is in a fourway tie for fourth place in the Big East and a victory in his first match with Thompson would be the breakthrough win Gonzalez needs to establish a solid foundation in the fertile recruiting bed that is the New York metropolitan area PERIOD
Gonzalez Pirates will push the roadweary Hoyas hard PERIOD The last time the Hoyas played twice in three days against a quick pressing team the result was a  loss at the hands of Villanova PERIOD
