A Kentucky reacts in the stands after an NCAA Final Four tournament college basketball semifinal game between Wisconsin and Kentucky Saturday April   in Indianapolis PERIOD Wisconsin won  PERIOD

Saturday night senior forward Frank Kaminski led the Wisconsin Badgers in ending Kentuckys road to perfection PERIOD The Badgers were able to keep Kentucky away in the final minutes and defeat the Wildcats  in the Final Four matchup PERIOD

Looking at the box score especially the scoring it is hard to see how Kentucky lost PERIOD The Wildcats had a stellar game shooting with  percent from the field including  percent from threepoint range PERIOD The Wildcats were also 9of10 from the line PERIOD But where they really fell short was on the boards PERIOD The Badgers outrebounded the Wildcats by  rebounds PERIOD

The final minutes proved to be Kentuckys demise starting with Wisconsin tying the game at  points with three minutes of play left PERIOD What was crucial about this moment is that Wisconsin got back its momentum on a basket that should have been called a shot clock violation PERIOD On this play sophomore forward Nigel Hayes missed a guarded shot in the post got his rebound and shot it again for the bucket PERIOD However the ball was still in his hands when the shot clock hit zero PERIOD This play was never reviewed and it proved to shift the game to Wisconsin PERIOD



From this point on Wisconsin took control PERIOD With one minute and  seconds left Badgers junior forward Sam Dekker drilled a threepointer to put them up  PERIOD After a free throw and a layup by Wildcat sophomore guard Aaron Harrison the score was  and Wisconsin called timeout PERIOD A crucial part to Kentucky falling apart in the final moments of the game was its freshman forward KarlAnthony Towns missing a free throw to put the Wildcats within one point PERIOD With  seconds left in the game Kentucky had to intentionally foul sophomore guard Bronson Koenig PERIOD Koenig sank both free throws putting the Badgers up by four PERIOD

Last year Kentucky and Michigan were tied with less than  seconds to go and Harrison nailed a threepointer to give the Wildcats the win PERIOD



Down four points the Wildcats went to Harrison again on Saturday with six seconds left PERIOD Harrison rose from nearly five feet behind the threepoint line and airballed the shot wide left PERIOD This solidified the Wisconsin victory to move on to the national championship game PERIOD Wisconsin went on to make more free throws and won  PERIOD

Wisconsin was able to outdefend perhaps one of the best defenses in history of collegiate basketball PERIOD The Badgers will go on to face the Duke Blue Devils and freshman stud Jahlil Okafor in what will shape up to be a great national championship game PERIOD
