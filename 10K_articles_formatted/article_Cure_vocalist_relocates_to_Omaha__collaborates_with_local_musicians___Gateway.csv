In a surprise press conference earlier this week Robert Smith front man for iconic 80s gothrock band The Cure announced his intentions to relocate to Omaha from his current residence in the United Kingdom PERIOD



Omaha is a newfound haven for musicians and artists Smith said at the conference PERIOD Its the only place I want to be right now. smith also cited health reasons for the sudden move I heard its fairly sunny a lot of the time there too. smith is notorious for his pasty complexion and dark brooding lyrics which are heavily influenced by the gloomy U.K PERIOD weather PERIOD He said he hopes the Midwestern climes will brighten his otherwisecloudy disposition and enable him to develop as an artist. at the press conference Smith also announced his departure from The Cure citing a desire to work with emofolkster Conor Oberst who currently records under the moniker Bright Eyes for Omahabased Saddle Creek Records PERIOD



Roberts split comes as a complete shock to the rest of the band fellow band member Simon Gallup said in a public statement made shortly after Smiths announcement PERIOD This is a dodgy move even for Robert. the Cure has toured and released records for more than  years with Smith the only constant in the bands lineup PERIOD



According to a bulletin released on The Cures official Web site thecure.com Smith first met Oberst in a pub after a Bright Eyes show in London during a recent Bright Eyes European tour PERIOD Smith reportedly said Oberst was completely smashed and I knew I liked the bloke immediately PERIOD Any chap who can hold that much liquor is a chap right after the cockles of my own heart maybe even the subcockles Im not sure. smith had also been impressed with Obersts live performance that night calling it intensely emotional and had been prompted to attend the concert after listening to early demos of Obersts next record Black Like the Dark Recesses of my Shattered Heart in the Night which were leaked onto the Internet PERIOD



Conor is a brilliant musician Smith said at the press conference PERIOD But I have much better hair. the two are reportedly hard at work recording a new song tentatively titled Lovesong for the Lover I Dont Have to Love. sources near the two musicians describe the song as acoustic mopecore with a perky vocal twist. oberst could not be reached for comment PERIOD
