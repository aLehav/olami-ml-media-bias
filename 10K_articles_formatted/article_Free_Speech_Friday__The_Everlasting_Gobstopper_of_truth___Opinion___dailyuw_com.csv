Ingrid you can jump off the train PERIOD And its high time you did. i looked up at my therapist from the pile of tissues on my lap stunned PERIOD I had just explained that I was trapped on a track of others expectations pummeling towards a career I didnt desire at a school that was miserably illfitting for me in a major that bored me to tears PERIOD Her words were the golden ticket I had spent years frantically ripping through thousands of Willy Wonka bars to find PERIOD The next day I withdrew from school and flew home from the Midwest to the shock of everyone but myself PERIOD

It wasnt until I started at the UW a year later that I came to see that my therapist hadnt given me anything but had simply pointed out what was already there PERIOD I had agency all along but just never realized it PERIOD Outside expectations perceived or real pressures and past mistakes dont have to dictate our trajectories or even our next steps PERIOD If youve lost yourself in the noise of others opinions and youre barreling towards somewhere you dont want to go its never too late to jump off the damn train PERIOD And on the other side of that terrifying leap the freedom that awaits will be well worth it PERIOD

Do you see that That shiny slip of paper sticking out of your coat pocket Thats your agency PERIOD And its pure gold PERIOD
