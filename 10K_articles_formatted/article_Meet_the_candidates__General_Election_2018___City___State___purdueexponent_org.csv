Mike Braun

U.S PERIOD Senate Mike Braun R.

Mike Braun did not respond to The Exponents invitation to participate in the Voters Guide PERIOD

Experience Braun is a businessman and politician from Jasper County PERIOD He graduated from Wabash College with a degree in economics and later acquired an M.B.A PERIOD from Harvard Business School PERIOD From  to  he served in the Indiana House of Representatives for the sixty-third district PERIOD Braun is challenging incumbent candidate Joe Donnelly PERIOD Throughout the campaign he has vowed to support President Donald Trumps agenda a sentiment echoed on his campaign website PERIOD

Higher Education

Brauns website does not include a stance on the affordability of higher education PERIOD

Health Care

According to his website Braun believes the Affordable Care Act has been unsuccessful PERIOD He points to inflating healthcare costs and a reduction in choices for consumers as reasons he thinks it should be repealed PERIOD He favors alternatives such as allowing consumers to purchase insurance across state lines and allowing businesses to pool together to purchase insurance at lower prices PERIOD

Joe Donnelly

U.S PERIOD Senate Joe Donnelly D.

Experience12 years spent working for Hoosiers in Congress

Should the federal government play a role in making higher education more accessible How so

Students seeking a degree at Purdue or anywhere else shouldnt have to take on a lifetime of debt PERIOD During my time in the Senate Ive worked to expand access to higher education by supporting full funding for Pell Grants and Ive led the way on G.I PERIOD Bill reform to ensure veterans and service members can fully access the education benefits they were promised PERIOD Ive also reached across the aisle to improve student financial literacy and have consistently supported reducing student loan interest rated because they shouldnt be higher than the interest rate to buy a home or car PERIOD

How would you suggest we go about controlling inflating healthcare costs

Our health care system isnt perfect but Im working with members of both parties to keep costs down and improve the system PERIOD Efforts by Washington Republicans to sabotage the nations health care system over the past two years will raise health care costs for Americans by more than a third next year PERIOD Other recent attempts to dismantle the system would raise costs for the average Hoosier by  every year or take away coverage for the . million Hoosiers under  with preexisting conditions PERIOD I oppose these partisan efforts to raise costs and destroy our health care for political gain PERIOD

In todays political climate is bipartisanship still a priority

Im Indianas hired help and I work for Hoosiers not any party or politician PERIOD Last year I was named the most bipartisan senator of the last  years still in office and I voted with President Trump  percent of the time PERIOD Ill work with him when its good for Indiana like when I voted for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch PERIOD But when he would harm Hoosiers like his attempts to take away health care for people with preexisting conditions Ill try to find a better way forward PERIOD Im here to do whats best for the people of Indiana PERIOD

How do you relate to your constituents

In addition to being out in the district daily and talking with constituents Im a Purdue graduate and someone who has spent my life in west central Indiana with my smallbusiness and agricultural background I relate to constituents in our district because I live it PERIOD

What is your current stance on the debate over healthcare legislation

The current system is not working PERIOD We need to make efforts to improve the availability of healthcare for Americans PERIOD This will require significant reform and its important we continue to look for cost effective ways for quality healthcare to be available PERIOD This requires a conservative practical approach to fixing healthcare PERIOD

What is your stance on immigrants and visas especially pertaining to scholarly activities

First we need to secure our borders for national security PERIOD Our immigration system is flawed and it negatively impacts our ability to bring in talented individuals looking to work and be educated in the United States PERIOD We can begin to fix this by addressing the diversity lottery and finding a solution to protect DREAMers PERIOD

Tobi Beck

U.S PERIOD House of Representatives Tobi Beck D.

ExperienceAs a combat veteran foster mother and experienced security and technology professional I am an accomplished and proven leader PERIOD After active duty I began my career in security design and technology and have helped our country recover from some of its worst moments such as when I was asked to help serve as additional security after the attacks of  PERIOD As a community leader I have taught CPR to hundreds of soldiers and civilians organized a campaign to provide winter hats to underprivileged children and even hosted an international organizations gathering that brought over  million to local businesses in the district PERIOD

How do you relate to your constituents

The role of a representative must be focused on lifting up the voices of the people in order to ensure that all views are heard PERIOD I plan to put divisiveness aside and work together with everyone within the Fourth District PERIOD Lasting solutions means putting aside differences in order to address the root of our problems PERIOD Many of the issues that face us are more complex than a tweet  we need to work with each other to create real solutions PERIOD My focus is on listening to constituents first PERIOD

What is your current stance on the debate over healthcare legislation

Healthcare that is stable affordable and accessible to all must be a priority PERIOD If you need a doctor you should be able to see a doctor without needing to worry about going into debt or risking your health PERIOD We currently have working models such as TriCare  the active military healthcare system that currently serves more than nine million people in our country  that could be expanded to serve everyone PERIOD However regardless of the path we take to we get there we know that affordable and accessible healthcare for everyone must be the end goal PERIOD

What is your stance on immigrants and visas especially pertaining to scholarly activities

America has always been proud to be the melting pot but we know that our immigration system has been broken for many years PERIOD We can have strong and secure borders while reforming our system so that it benefits everyone as well as our country as a whole PERIOD We need a safe efficient and legal path to citizenship for immigrants and refugees who positively contribute to our society including those coming into our country for academic or scholarly purposes PERIOD

Ron Alting

State Senate Ron Alting R.

ExperienceAlting is a proud graduate of Purdue University PERIOD In  he was elected to represent Senate District  in the Indiana State Senate PERIOD In  Alting was appointed chair of the influential Senate Committee on Public Policy PERIOD In this position he has presided over many important policies affecting the lives of Hoosiers across the state PERIOD

Indiana is often considered to be a businessfriendly state PERIOD How does the state maintain that reputation while ensuring workers are protected and receiving a living wage

Indiana was recently included among the Tax Foundations top  states with the best business climate PERIOD Weve achieved this by offering education training and job opportunities that allow Hoosiers to excel in their careers and earn highwages PERIOD An example of this is the recently introduced Workforce Ready Grant which provides financial aid to any high school graduate seeking industry certification PERIOD Making sure Hoosiers have the proper education and resources is helps ensure workers are protected and receiving a satisfactory living wage PERIOD

CBD oil has been legal in Indiana for over six months now PERIOD Given the growing number of states legalizing marijuana as a whole where do you see the future of the cannabis industry heading in Indiana

This is a personal issue for me PERIOD My wife had breast cancer and passed away at  years old PERIOD Scientists are now reporting that THC and other cannabinoids such as CBD can slow growth andor eliminate certain types of cancer cells PERIOD Clinical trials using cannabinoids to treat cancer are in the works PERIOD I believe we should exhaust every option available to find a cure for cancer PERIOD I am an ally to anyone who seeks this legislation and hope we can work towards legalizing medicinal marijuana to help all Hoosiers with cancer and other medical issues PERIOD

What is your priority if elected during the next legislative session

My priorities are to

Push for a budget that does not raise taxes and provides adequate education funding to our schools and teachers and supports preK programs and higher education institutions like Purdue University PERIOD

Pass bias crimes legislation Senate Bill  that would hold accountable those who harm an individual or group based on real or perceived characteristics such as race religion and sex among other things by allowing a court to consider it an aggravating circumstance when determining sentencing PERIOD

Promote the inclusion of all individuals through my position as chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Policy PERIOD

Along with these three priorities I will continue to help pass bipartisan legislation that benefits all Hoosiers PERIOD

Sherry Shipley

State Senate Sherry Shipley D.

Experience30year educator PhD in Industrial Technology Management community volunteer and leader PERIOD

Indiana is often considered to be a businessfriendly state PERIOD How does the state maintain that reputation while ensuring workers are protected and receiving a living wage

We can do that with more balanced representation in our state government PERIOD Republican super majority legislation like Right to Work repeal of Common Construction Wage and RFRA have had a sustained adverse impact on Indiana businesses and Hoosier workers PERIOD Also Indiana loses . billion in annual productivity and  Hoosiers leave their jobs due to the lack of affordable reliable quality childcare PERIOD Through policies that safeguard workers cultivate regional and global business relationships and support training and education for our workforce we can create a strong business and entrepreneurial ecosystem which leads the world in innovation and upward mobility for all Hoosiers PERIOD

CBD oil has been legal in Indiana for over six months now PERIOD Given the growing number of states legalizing marijuana as a whole where do you see the future of the cannabis industry heading in Indiana

I support hemp as an important emerging crop and industry for Indiana PERIOD Indiana is already behind in the commercial hemp industry and as a leader in agriculture production and supply chain I believe we are missing out on a number of opportunities in research industry leadership and economic growth PERIOD Indiana farmers could benefit greatly from this cash crop PERIOD Last year farmers in Kentucky were paid18 million for legalized hemp PERIOD We are relinquishing a sustained income stream because the Indiana State Senate failed to act PERIOD It is time for Indiana to elect Senators that understand this topic are ready to legalize medical marijuana and recognize industrial hemp as an important alternative crop PERIOD

What is your priority if elected during the next legislative session

I would work to reduce standardized testing and legislate that any private or charter school accepting public tax money be held to the same standards and expectations as public schools PERIOD I would work with Dr PERIOD McCormick Supt PERIOD of Public Instruction to lower the compulsory school age from  to  years old so that little Hoosiers dont have to wait to start learning PERIOD I would also work to expand Gov PERIOD Holcombs Next Level Jobs grant funding so that qualifying Hoosier college students would have their first year paid and all students could get a good start on their career without bankrupting their future PERIOD I would sponsor alongoverdue hate crime bill PERIOD

Should farmers in Indiana be allowed to grow hemp Why or why not

Industrial hemp is a viable cash crop for Hoosier farmers PERIOD The question of the appropriate oversight of industrial hemp seed to insure the seed has less than the legal limit of THC must be answered PERIOD The federal government has not made industrial hemp production legal but has chosen to ignore states that allow its production as long as the seed is carefully monitored PERIOD Rural development can be helped by growing industrial hemp PERIOD Processing and manufacturing facilities in rural areas would provide good jobs for rural residents PERIOD One example is processing industrial hemp into automobile door panel liners for Indiana automobile manufacturers PERIOD

What do you see as the most hotly debated subjects in the next General Assembly

I have no knowledge of any bills yet filed for the  legislative session but certainly rumors are flying PERIOD Topics I hear most frequently mentioned include a hate crime bill gun control medical marijuana and education matters among others PERIOD Oh and I forgot to mention redistricting reform PERIOD

What do you think about needle exchange programs and other programs to combat the opioid epidemic

We must try all measures to combat the opioid crisis PERIOD Hoosiers deserve accs to needed treatment to recover from addiction PERIOD Indiana has added medication assisted treatment facilities within an hour of every Hoosier home PERIOD Needle exchange programs housed with medication assisted treatment can reduce the spread of illnesses like hepatitis and HIV while encouraging addicts to try Medication assisted treatment PERIOD Faithbased treatment behavior modification therapy and wrap around services such as mental health counseling education life skills and other resources on the continuum of care help addicts recover and return to being productive member of our communities PERIOD We have a moral imperative to work with our addicted Hoosiers toward their recovery PERIOD

Chris Campbell

State House of Representatives Chris Campbell D.

Experience Current occupation is audiologist PERIOD Neighborhood organization and communication for nearly  years PERIOD West Lafayette Redevelopment Commission for  years review budgets and spending on development projects for the city of West Lafayette PERIOD West Lafayette Library Board  years Also reviewed the budget and spending for the library PERIOD I have worked for a number of years in the community with residents on projects and community events bringing people with diverse options together to be productive PERIOD

Should farmers in Indiana be allowed to grow hemp Why or why not

To compete in national and international markets we need to give Hoosier farmers as many options as we can PERIOD I support farmers who want to grow industrial hemp in Indiana PERIOD Since hemp is an environmentally friendly and industrially advantageous crop it could be a good alternative for some farmers PERIOD And since it is a different strain from its psychoactive relative cannabis a practical and responsible regulatory system could make good economic sense PERIOD

What do you see as the most hotly debated subjects in the next General Assembly

Of the most hotly debated issues the first may be how to best serve our public schools PERIOD The diversion of tax dollars away from public schools has been devastating PERIOD Across the state it resulted in low teacher salaries closings and eliminated services PERIOD Funding must be restored to our schools to give all students a quality education PERIOD This includes Indianas public colleges and universities PERIOD Fees and tuitions grew faster than inflation levels PERIOD For many a degree is still out of reach PERIOD Far too often those that can attend and graduate carry excessive debt PERIOD We must continue to find ways to make a college education more affordable PERIOD

What do you think about needleexchange programs and other programs to combat the opioid epidemic

The opioid epidemic has an enormous impact on communities across Indiana PERIOD We must address this issue at multiple levels including education prevention mitigation and treatment PERIOD After an addiction occurs chronic medical and mental health problems must be solved PERIOD Preventing shared and reused needles reduces illnesses such as HIV and Hepatitis C PERIOD These programs make sense from both a compassionate AND economic point of view PERIOD Needle exchange programs also act as opportunities to give addicts information and access to treatment programs PERIOD Needle exchange programs work to reduce harm PERIOD But theyre only part of the story PERIOD They fit into a comprehensive approach PERIOD

How will you fix jail overcrowding

Our county jail has nearly doubled to  inmates in the last four years and it is at near capacity daily PERIOD We MUST change our strategy PERIOD We MUST provide addiction treatment services and mental health programs to stop the revolving door of addiction in and out of our jail PERIOD This summer I visited seven county jails in Indiana PERIOD I learned how other Sheriffs were reducing their jail populations with successful treatment programs PERIOD As your Sheriff I WILL implement these successful programs here in Tippecanoe County to help people in need and save tax dollars in the long run PERIOD

What is the key difference between you and your opponent

Experience is the key difference PERIOD As Chief of Police for over a decade I have successfully led an 80plus member law enforcement agency and managed a . million annual budget PERIOD As president of the Indiana Association of Chiefs of Police I routinely work with Sheriffs Chiefs and other leaders across Indiana to solve problems PERIOD Training and education are paramount for todays law enforcement leaders PERIOD My work at Purdue IU and the F.B.I PERIOD Academy have prepared me to lead our sheriffs office in these challenging times PERIOD

What will you do to remedy historically low staffing of correctional officers

Correctional Officers have a challenging job especially as the jail population has nearly doubled in the last four years and little to no staff have been added to help compensate PERIOD As Sheriff I will work with our council and commissioners to prioritize adding jail staff to keep pace with our increased jail population PERIOD I will also significantly increase training and education for Correctional Officers to better support the challenging job they do for our community PERIOD

How will you fix jail overcrowding

You cant control the decision of the judges or when someone commits a crime PERIOD We try to find a mental health facility for those suffering from mental illness instead of booking them into jail PERIOD Opioid addiction is adding to jail overcrowding having a facility where individuals could be taken to detox and begin the process of getting professional help would be beneficial PERIOD Limit how far we will travel to pick up a person that has a warrant for a minor offense PERIOD Working with judges and prosecutor is what I will do to make every attempt to fix our current situation PERIOD

What is the key difference between you and your opponent

Born and raised in Tippecanoe County PERIOD I have seen our community evolve PERIOD I have built positive relationships in this community with people from all walks of life and for  of my  years I have been doing it as a correctional officer and deputy with the Tippecanoe County Sheriff Department PERIOD There isnt a learning curve for me on the responsibilities of the department PERIOD Our department is responsible for much more than a city police department and I am fully aware of the differences PERIOD Over the years I have worked with all local agencies numerous outside agencies and federal agencies PERIOD

What will you do to remedy historically low staffing of correctional officers

The jail is the number  priority of the sheriff department and I will work with the County Commissioners and County Council on getting more correctional officers PERIOD I will use my experience as a correctional officer and ask current correctional officers to meet with the commissioners and council to share their concerns with low staffing PERIOD I believe correctional officers make some of the best police officers and if ours want to be police officers I will work to set them up to achieve their goal whether it be at our agency or another this alone will help with retention PERIOD
