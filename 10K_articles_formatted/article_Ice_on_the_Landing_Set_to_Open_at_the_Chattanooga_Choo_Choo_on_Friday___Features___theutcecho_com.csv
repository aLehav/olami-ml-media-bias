With the COVID19 pandemic still going strong in the United States a ton of events which were scheduled for this year had to be cancelled but some events such as Chattanooga Choo Choos Ice on the Landing are full steam ahead for the winter season PERIOD

Ice on the Landing has been around for years and is one of Chattanoogas most popular seasonal ice skating rinks PERIOD For  the ice is set to open Nov PERIOD  and continue operation into January PERIOD A single 80minute skating session will cost  for adults and  for children under .Additional information on prices and hours can be found on their website PERIOD

There are many changes being put in place moving forward to help keep skaters and staff safe PERIOD Some of these include sanitizing stations regular cleaning of the rails and a limit of  minutes per skater with colored wrist bands dictating groups and times PERIOD

One of the newest changes includes the rink operating at half capacityroughly seventy five people PERIOD This allows more people to enter the rink in a safe rotation PERIOD

Carla Pritchard is the owner and manager of Chattanooga Presents a company that puts on several different events in Chattanooga including Ice on the Landing PERIOD

We havent been able to do anything else this year but we were determined to pull off Ice on the Landing Pritchard said PERIOD We brainstormed the best way to make it happen this year PERIOD Of course safety was our top priority in everything. pritchard also said that she hopes maintaining half capacity will create more skating room for attendees and generally make it a more enjoyable experience PERIOD

Pritchard said that she and Chattanooga Presents are excited to be able to open Ice on the Landing this year despite everything that has occurred PERIOD

People are ready to get back outside after being stuck inside for so long she said PERIOD Its a great way to celebrate the holidays. pritchard said that shes excited for people to be able to experience Ice on the Landing this year because so many people have enjoyed it in the past PERIOD

Its beginner friendly and its a way that we can get back out into the community safely and get back a sense of normality Pritchard said PERIOD
