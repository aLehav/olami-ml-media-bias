2639,2023-11-04,"its a Friday night and after at least a week of complaining about craving shabushabu my boyfriend has finally buckled under the weight of my complaints and brought me out to our favorite spot Mokkoji ShabuShabu Bar PERIOD After waiting for at least a halfhour in a bustling corner of the plaza on Jeffrey and Trabuco we walk in to find the windows fogged up with the steam rising from the boiling pots of broth that line the bar and cover the tabletops PERIOD With tantalizing scents of sesame miso and garlic warming the air I can barely wait to get my butt in a chair and get my shabu on PERIOD

Some background on the cuisine  shabushabu is a Japanese dish that involves cooking meat vegetables and noodles in your very own or perhaps shared with a loved one tabletop pot of boiling water traditionally seasoned with seaweed PERIOD The thinlycut slices of meat are served raw and meant to be placed in the pot piecebypiece to avoid overcooking PERIOD Shabushabu is a onomatopoeia wordplay that translates to swish swish referring to the simple and quick motion needed to fully cook your meat PERIOD Served with a variety of veggies udon andor ramen noodles a number of dipping sauces and a bowl of rice a meal of shabushabu is both an interactive and deliciously satisfying experience PERIOD

Mokkoji opened in  is a shabushabu restaurant that plays with both traditional and innovative elements they cover all the same bases as an authentic shabu place like particular sauces and cuts of meat while also offering a variety of special broths shoutout to spicy miso and locallysourced seasonal vegetables and craft beers PERIOD Yup an everrotating menu of craft beers on draft a factor that definitely sets this place apart from your usual shabu spot PERIOD

The restaurant is small but the extensive bar allows for a comfortable amount of space between parties  in other words a group friends taking shots at the bar and a family enjoying a loving meal at a cozy table can coexist in the same space PERIOD The service is consistently good employees in black shirts bearing the Mokkoji logo dash around the restaurant refilling drinks and delivering plates of veggies and meat to hungry customers PERIOD

This particular Friday evening the boyfriend and I were trying to ball on a budget and after perusing the menu decided on the dinner special for  an appetizer of garlic shrimp a carafe of hot sake a 32piece plate of choice ribeye and a dessert of ice cream macarons all for around  bucks price varies depending on the cut of meat chosen PERIOD While we usually come to Mokkoji for their outofthisworld lunch special a regular plate of beef belly for TEN BUCKS I consider this dinner deal a very competitive price to beat especially taking into account that shabu places usually jack up their prices considerably on their dinner menus PERIOD

The garlic shrimp was crunchy and packed with flavor and our huge plate of New York steak was beyond plentiful for the first time I found myself struggling to finish my share PERIOD After we had finished our meat the boyfriend opted for the  porridge option where a server mixes your leftover broth with rice and a number of seasonings which vary depending on the type of porridge options include seaweed porridge kimchi porridge and squid ink porridge PERIOD The result is a complex layering of flavors all thanks to the addition of the savory slowcooked broth PERIOD

While Mokkoji shines continuously in the quality and amazing flavors of their meats and broths and their unique quirks  like their logobranded tofu  what I enjoy most about this restaurant is how welcoming it is how the interactive and somewhat adventurous nature of shabushabu is bettered by the lively and contemporary environment that Mokkoji provides PERIOD

The unique flavor of shabushabu brings about a lot of memorable moments in my mind the first time I brought my parents to Mokkoji my father was thoroughly squicked at the sight of mounds of raw beef on the plate before him PERIOD Minutes later he was happily slurping up udon noodles and showing me his swish technique for how to get the perfect medium rare slice of ribeye PERIOD When I first brought my boyfriend he finished his meal with a disgruntled sigh complaining about how Id kept this place a secret from him all this time PERIOD 
Watching the people I love engage with this tactical cuisine has been a lot of fun for me and introducing friends to shabu continues to be a hobby of mine PERIOD While my busy schedule means I may not always have a lot of time to spend with my loved ones shabushabu allows me to share both a meal and an experience with the time we do have together all over a foamy pot of broth and a couple shots of sake PERIOD
