If you were to rewind to three weeks ago Clemson was starting to look like one of the top allaround collegiate sports schools PERIOD They were preparing to play Ohio State in the College Football Playoffs CFP and were on a hot start in basketball with a  record after a big victory over No PERIOD  Florida State University FSU PERIOD Now lets snap back to reality PERIOD Clemson got manhandled in the CFP semifinals against Ohio State losing  and have lost three straight games in basketball to No PERIOD  Virginia unranked Georgia Tech and unranked FSU PERIOD Unfortunately the football season is over until September but the basketball season is just getting started PERIOD Now its time to figure out what is going wrong with Clemson basketball PERIOD

For starters Clemson needs to improve tremendously on the offensive side of the ball PERIOD Clemson currently ranks No PERIOD  in points per game with an average of . pERIOD They are also averaging less than a point per possession at . placing them two hundredth in the nation for offensive efficiency PERIOD Some teams that rank higher in this category are Campbell Pepperdine UNC Greensboro and the entire Atlantic Coast Conference ACC except for Miami FL PERIOD One reason why Clemson has been struggling so mightily on offense is that they dont have a star to carry the load PERIOD Although there are games where players like Nick Honor or Aamir Simms explode for  plus points it isnt a regular occurrence PERIOD

Clemson basketball Head Coach Brad Brownell said after the loss to Virginia at home Were not one of the most talented teams PERIOD We cant just show up and play PERIOD We dont have a guy we throw the ball to and hes going to go make a bunch of plays. unlike Clemson football Clemson basketball survives on lockdown defense PERIOD In the  games leading up to Virginia Clemson ranked No PERIOD  in opponents points per game . and ninth in opponents turnovers per game . pERIOD This means that Clemson was a top team defensively PERIOD However during Clemsons losing streak they looked like they forgot the one thing that was carrying their team all season disciplined defense PERIOD Virginia scored  points to pair with only seven turnovers Georgia Tech scored  points and turned the ball over  times and FSU scored  points while having  turnovers PERIOD Thus when Clemson cant force turnovers and limit good shot opportunities their chances to win a game are slim since their offense hasnt shown that they can compete in a shootout PERIOD In the  games Clemson has played they have only won two games when the opponent scored  or more points PERIOD

For Clemson to get back on track they need to do three things limit their opponents 3point percentage force turnovers and establish ball movement PERIOD In the past three games Clemson played Virginia Georgia Tech and Florida State have all shot  or better from 3point range PERIOD In eight of Clemsons first  games they held their opponents to  or less from 3point range PERIOD Therefore they need to limit 3point shooting to help keep them in the game with a at times lackluster offense PERIOD Clemson was a top  defense at forcing turnovers before their game against Virginia PERIOD This is important because forcing turnovers helps limit their opponents points and it allows them more opportunities to score PERIOD

Finally Clemson needs to create ball movement and spacing since they lack a star offensive player PERIOD Creating ball movement will allow there to be more lanes and holes for players to have easy and open shots PERIOD It will also help free up shots for their best 3point shooters Alex Hemenway Nick Honor and Hunter Tyson PERIOD

Clemson has a date with No PERIOD  Louisville on Jan PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD with hopes to end their threegame losing streak PERIOD Make sure to keep an eye on Clemsons senior leaders Aamir Simms and Clyde Trapp as they hope to jumpstart Clemsons defense against a talented Louisville team PERIOD

Edited on Jan PERIOD   to reflect change to Clemsons basketball schedule PERIOD
