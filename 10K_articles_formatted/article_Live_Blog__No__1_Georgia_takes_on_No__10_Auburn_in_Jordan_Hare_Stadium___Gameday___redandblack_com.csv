The Georgia Bulldogs face off against the Auburn Tigers in Auburn for the tenth game of the  season PERIOD Seniorstaff writer Layne Saliba will run the live blog whilefellowsenior staff writer Jed May tweets about the action as it happens PERIOD

Final ThoughtsTheres not a lot to say about this game except that Georgia didnt play well PERIOD At all PERIOD The first drive looked good but after that Georgia struggled in a major way PERIOD The offensive line couldnt make any room for the backfield to run the ball and Jake Fromm couldnt find any time to pass the ball PERIOD

Credit the Auburn defense because when Fromm was able to pass the ball he didnt really spread it around much making it easy for the defense to key in on where the ball would likely be going PERIOD

Georgia made some really bad mistakes too PERIOD There were the penalties that added up to  yards for Georgia a fumble and a bad decision on a punt return PERIOD

Jarrett Stidham and Kerryon Johnson had their way with the Georgia defense for the most part PERIOD Johnson had  allpurpose yards and Stidham threw or  PERIOD

To be honest shortly after Georgias first drive it really looked like the Bulldogs didnt stand a chance in this game PERIOD

 Q4Thats it from JordanHare Stadium PERIOD Georgia falls to  on the season PERIOD

 Q4Fromm is able to find Riley Ridley over the top for a touchdown PERIOD That gives the Bulldogs one rushing and one passing touchdown today.Auburn leads  PERIOD

 Q4And the  chants start ringing out from Auburn fans PERIOD Players start dancing to the music over the PA system PERIOD But the first down stands and that quiets the crowd pretty quick PERIOD

 Q4The referees bring out the chains to measure and it looks like a first down for Georgia PERIOD Seems like its been a while since a first down happened PERIOD But Auburn is challenging the spot of the ball PERIOD

 Q4Georgia is still trying to put more points on the board as the clock winds down PERIOD Fromm is airing it out with just a little luck but not enough PERIOD

 Q4Looks like Auburn is planning to run Georgia out or JordanHare Stadium or Auburn altogether PERIOD The Tigers score on a 55yard screen pass to Johnson.Auburn leads  PERIOD

 Q4Georgia still cant make anything happen on offense PERIOD It has a lot to do with this offensive line not being able to create holes or give Fromm enough time to pass the ball PERIOD Its struggling against a good defense PERIOD

 Q4Auburn cant get the touchdown but still gets a field goal out of the drive.Auburn leads  PERIOD

 Q4Auburn isnt done just yet PERIOD The Tigers take one down the field  yards to get into Georgia territory PERIOD

 Q3 Time for the fourth quarter now PERIOD Georgia still trails Auburn  PERIOD Auburn will start with the ball on its own 26yard line PERIOD

 Q3 This Georgia offense is really struggling PERIOD Its another 3andout for the Bulldogs PERIOD Reminder Georgia has only scored one touchdown today PERIOD

 Q3Georgias defense holds and gets a big stop PERIOD Auburn has to punt and Georgia will take over on their own 45yard line PERIOD

 Q3Georgia gets on the board for the first time since early in the first quarter with a 47yard field goal.Auburn leads  PERIOD

 Q3And Fromm does it again with a long one downfield to Javon Wims PERIOD Georgias in Auburn territory now PERIOD

 Q3Fromm completes a pass just looking to make something work PERIOD

 Q3And just like that Auburn gets another score through the air this time to Ryan Davis who breaks a few tackles and takes it  yards.Auburn leads  PERIOD

 Q3Georgia is not used to being behind and its showing PERIOD After that personal foul on the Bulldogs following the punt Georgia now has seven penalties for  yards PERIOD

 Q3Georgias still not able to get much going on offense PERIOD Nizialek comes in to punt PERIOD

 Q3Auburn takes advantage of Georgias special teams miscue and gets a touchdown out of it.Auburn leads  PERIOD

 Q3 It looked like a 3rddown conversion for Auburn but after review the Tigers didnt catch the ball and are forced to punt PERIOD Mecole Hardman tries to take the punt on the run but drops it and Auburn recovers on Georgias 23yard line PERIOD

 Q3Auburn chooses to receive to start the second half PERIOD

First Half ThoughtsThis is no doubt going to be a defensive battle until the end PERIOD Georgia won that battle in the first quarter and Auburn won it in the second PERIOD

On the offensive side of the ball though both teams seem to be having more success through the air surprisingly  Auburn has  passing yards and Georgia has  PERIOD

Nick Chubb and Sony Michel have been pretty limited for the first half with just  yards and  yards on the ground respectively PERIOD Most of Georgias success has come from three total passes split between Javon Wims and Terry Godwin PERIOD

Whats hurt the Bulldogs the most is the offensive line PERIOD Jake Fromm has been sacked three times for  yards PERIOD One of them may have been held a little too long by Fromm but the other two sacks should have been prevented PERIOD

Auburn on the other hand looks like a well oiled machine PERIOD Its defense is making all the stops it needs to and has only allowed Georgia  yards of total offense so far PERIOD On top of that Kerryon Johnson has all  of the Tigers rush yards and Jarrett Stidham has been able to split up his passes between seven different Auburn players PERIOD

If things keep going like this Auburn will run away with this game giving Georgia its first loss of the season PERIOD

 Q2Thats it for the first half PERIOD Georgia runs out the clock with a missed field goal and the teams go to the locker rooms with the Tigers leading  PERIOD

 Q2Mecole Hardman is eventually going to break one off for a touchdown PERIOD Not this time though PERIOD He takes it to Auburns 26yard line PERIOD

 Q2Georgia cant turn it into points and has to punt it away PERIOD This is Georgias largest deficit this season so well see how Fromm handles it PERIOD In case youre wondering its very loud in this stadium PERIOD

 Q2 Georgia gets a big time catch from Javon Wims PERIOD He has two catches for  yards today PERIOD

 Q2Auburn throws to the end zone to Darius Slayton who was being double covered but somehow comes up with the catch for a touchdown PERIOD The play is reviewed but is confirmed.Auburn leads  PERIOD

 Q2Its nothing but a defensive battle out here PERIOD Georgia forces a 3andout but draws a personal foul to give Auburn a new set of downs PERIOD

 Q2And there goes the Auburn defense too PERIOD Its not letting up a single thing PERIOD Georgia punts it away and gets hit with an interference call PERIOD

 Q2Looks like Georgia was able to regroup since it was last on the field PERIOD The defense was able to come up with a big stop there and force a punt PERIOD Georgia takes over on their own 34yard line PERIOD

 Q2Jake Fromm is sacked for the second time in this first half bringing up fourth down PERIOD Nizialek on to punt now PERIOD

 Q2Jake Fromm goes deep to a wide open Riley Ridley who would have easily gotten to the end one but Ridley drops the pass PERIOD

 Q2Georgia stops Auburn again but the Tigers make the field goal.Auburn leads  PERIOD

Georgia is now in an unfamiliar spot trailing for the first time since  at ND on Sept PERIOD 

 Q2Looks like everything is going Auburns way right now PERIOD Georgias defense is getting outplayed so far in this second quarter as Georgia calls a timeout with the Tigers on Georgias 13yard line PERIOD

 Q2 After Georgia punts it away pinning Auburn deep the Tigers break off two big runs to get near their own 41yard line PERIOD

 Q1Thats the end of the first quarter here at JordanHare Stadium PERIOD Georgia seems to be doing fine on offense and defense but Auburn is still getting close enough to turn its possessions into points PERIOD Georgia still leads  PERIOD

 Q1Mecole Hardman tuns it on with a 49yard kickoff return to put Georgia near midfield to start the drive PERIOD

 Q1Auburn has a big third down coming up here and it is loud in JordanHare Stadium PERIOD The Tigers make it happen and sack Jake Fromm for a loss of  yards PERIOD

 Q1 And with that carry Nick Chubb passes Bo Jackson for the No PERIOD  spot on the SEC AllTime Rushing Yards list PERIOD

As Outkast would say Im sorry Mr PERIOD Jackson ohChubb is for real PERIOD httpst.coChfI3iiRpF

 Q1Jake Fromm was  for  yards on that first drive  all to different Georgia players PERIOD

 Q1Georgia stops Auburn just past midfield but the Tigers trust in their place kicker and rightfully so PERIOD He just made a 54yard field goal.Georgia leads  PERIOD

 Q1Auburn doesnt seem to be having too much trouble working its way downfield either PERIOD Secondary gave up a big gain and then Kerryon Johnson carried for a big gain too PERIOD

 Q1Georgia scores on a 1yard Nick Chubb rush up the middle PERIOD That drive only took  PERIOD Georgia came out scored quick and now gets to show if its defense can stop the Tigers.Georgia leads  PERIOD

 Q1This Georgia offense is moving along PERIOD Its down inside the 5yard line now after a few Sony Michel carries PERIOD

 Q1Auburn wins the toss and defers to the second half PERIOD Georgia will receive to start the game PERIOD

Pregame ThoughtsGeorgia and Auburn will both be at JordanHare Stadium to play what might be the coldest game of Georgias season PERIOD Right now its  degrees and pretty windy PERIOD The wind probably wont be much of a factor for these teams though PERIOD Georgias backfield of Nick Chubb and Sony Michel will likely take care of things on the ground and Auburns Kerryon Johnson will do the same PERIOD Georgia has already locked down a spot in the Southeastern Conference Championship but the Tigers are still fighting for their spot PERIOD With a win over Georgia all it would need is a win over Alabama in two weeks to get a rematch with Georgia for the conference championship PERIOD

The biggest news for the Bulldogs is having a key linebacker in Natrez Patrick back on defense for the first time in four weeks to help limit Johnsons carries PERIOD Patrick is listed as the starter on the depth chart PERIOD
