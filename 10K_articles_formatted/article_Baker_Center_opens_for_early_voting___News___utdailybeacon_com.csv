Nissa DahlinBrown associate director of the Baker Center was one of the people who helped launch and organize early voting at the center PERIOD

Its so important particularly for students because laws that are enacted in the next congress are going to impact young voters a lot more than they are going to impact me in the future DahlinBrown said PERIOD So you need to have your voice heard and make sure they understand. many students expressed similar opinions to DahlinBrowns saying that the Baker Center provides a convenient alternative PERIOD Voters who wait until Nov PERIOD  will likely endure longer lines and they will have to vote at a specific location based on the address they registered with PERIOD
