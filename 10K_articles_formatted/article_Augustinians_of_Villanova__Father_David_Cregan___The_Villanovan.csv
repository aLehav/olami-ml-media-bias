Olivia Sabalaskey Staff WriterJanuary  

Even though most of us dont think that we are worthy the greatest thing that we can do is to offer ourselves in all of our triumphs and in all of our tragedies to God and to let God mold us Father David Cregan O.S.A. ph.D PERIOD said PERIOD

This week Fr PERIOD David offers Villanovans a glimpse into his life as an Augustinian at Villanova University in the Augustinians of Villanova Column PERIOD

Fr PERIOD David grew up in a devout Roman Catholic and Irish family PERIOD Although his parents moved from Ireland to the Philadelphia area to raise a family they returned to Ireland when Fr PERIOD David was just seven years old PERIOD He remembers his time in Ireland fondly describing his primary school years as very formative PERIOD

Fr PERIOD David and his family later returned to the Philadelphia area PERIOD Fr PERIOD David attended Monsignor Bonner  Archbishop Prendergast Catholic High School an Augustinian Catholic high school located in Drexel Hill Pennsylvania PERIOD During Fr PERIOD Davids Senior Year Retreat he not only felt a strong connection to God but also a calling to join the Order of St PERIOD Augustine commonly referred to as the Augustinians PERIOD Like many of his peers in his senior class Fr PERIOD David chose to attend Villanova University as an undergraduate because of his interest in the Augustinian way of life and the encouragement he received from the Vocation Director at the time PERIOD

Fr PERIOD David started his freshman year in the fall of  and pursued a major in the Department of Theatre and Studio Art PERIOD

During Fr PERIOD Davids undergraduate years at Villanova he struggled in choosing between pursuing a professional career in theatre and joining the Augustinians PERIOD As recommended by Villanovas Vocation Director at the time Fr PERIOD David moved to New York after his graduation from Villanova to pursue a career in theatre given that the Augustinians would always be here the Vocation Director said PERIOD

Fr PERIOD David participated in three national tours an OffBroadway show and later worked at a repertory theater in St PERIOD Louis Missouri in which he joined several fan favorite musicals including Anything Goes South Pacific and Gypsy. however the Roman Catholic faith remained an integral part of Fr PERIOD Davids life as he continued to attend Sunday mass and prayed often PERIOD

During one Sunday Mass Fr PERIOD David was shocked to see a familiar face his high school religion teacher an Augustinian PERIOD After the Augustinian offered Mass attendees information regarding the mission appeal Fr PERIOD David chatted with him reminiscing on his high school years and his love for Monsignor Bonner  Archbishop Prendergast Catholic High School PERIOD

When I walked back home I had a rare aha moment in which I realized that I was supposed to become an Augustinian Fr PERIOD David said PERIOD It didnt take me completely by surprise though because I had been thinking about it since I was  years old. fr PERIOD David then traveled back to New York given that he still had a few months left on his apartments lease PERIOD Upon his return to New York Fr PERIOD David gave himself an ultimatum PERIOD

It was time to make a choice Fr PERIOD David said PERIOD I would stay in New York only if I got a part in a Broadway show nothing else. although Fr PERIOD David auditioned for Bye Bye Birdie and received a callback he did not get a part in the musical PERIOD Feeling at peace Fr PERIOD David knew that it was time to return back to Philadelphia his home PERIOD Upon his arrival Fr PERIOD David spoke with Rev PERIOD Peter Donohue O.S.A. ph.D. seeking guidance from the Vocation Director regarding his next steps in the process to become an Augustinian PERIOD

Fr PERIOD David then participated in two Masters programs at the Washington Theological Union and the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C PERIOD

After I completed both Masters programs Fr PERIOD Ed Dobbin and Fr PERIOD Peter suggested that I return to Ireland to pursue a Ph.D PERIOD in Irish Dramatic Literature and another Masters in Irish Theatre and Film at Trinity College in Dublin Fr PERIOD David said PERIOD It was so ironic that I was to return to Ireland because my family has been going back and forth between Ireland and Philadelphia for years. in  Fr PERIOD David was ordained an Augustinian priest and he thrived during his years in Dublin given that his extended family lived steps away from where he lived and studied PERIOD

In  Fr PERIOD David returned to Villanova and taught fulltime in the Department of Theatre and Studio Art PERIOD

It was in  that the Provincial asked Fr PERIOD David to become a Novice Director an integral part of the Formation process PERIOD

I took a three year leave of absence from Villanova and moved to Wisconsin Fr PERIOD David said PERIOD In  I returned to Villanova and heartily accepted the position of Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and Strategic Initiatives for the College of Professional Studies while also continuing to teach theatre to undergraduates. fr PERIOD David finds his work in the College of Professional Studies to be a perfect fit for him and he values its mission PERIOD

It is a fantastic place to be because in the Villanova culture there are a lot of people that need and want support Fr PERIOD David said PERIOD In Professional Studies we make it more affordable help students with their debt and support the children of our invaluable Villanova employees through the program Rise. when asked about his favorite part of being an Augustinian at Villanova University Fr PERIOD David was surprised at how easy it was to answer the question PERIOD

Nothing tops what it is like to be in the St PERIOD Thomas of Villanova Church on a Sunday night Fr PERIOD David said PERIOD It is so peaceful so rejuvenating PERIOD Being with all of the young students who are so dedicated to their Catholic faith is truly beautiful. fr PERIOD David says Daily Mass often on Tuesday and Thursday nights at  p.m PERIOD in Corr Chapel PERIOD All are welcome to attend PERIOD
