965,2018-11-16,"tucked away in the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum are three geodesic domes housing  species of drought tolerant plants PERIOD The domes loom over the other gardens and act as a visual contrast to the landscape PERIOD This Institute of the Arts and Sciences exhibition Future Garden for the Central Coast of California focuses on the planting and continual study of these species.Pioneers in the ecological art movement Newton Harrison and his late wife Helen Mayer Harrison envisioned Future Garden two years ago to uncover which plant species would be most resilient in the face of warmer temperatures PERIOD The Harrisons blended the artistic design of the domes with environmental sciences to explore creative solutions to climate change.The exhibition opened spring  after a year of restoration and is continually evolving PERIOD Martin Quigley executive director of the arboretum assisted in the gardens creation and design.Im hoping that the students who are here for two to four years will come down just in that time and see a real difference Quigley said PERIOD Theyll be more knowledgeable about what climate change actually means. the domes house heatadapted plants like coast buckwheat lizard tail and foothill sage PERIOD Photo by Christina Bulosan.In spring Future Garden plants began to grow PERIOD UCSC Arboretum scientists and botanists are now preparing to begin weather trials on the plants PERIOD They are waiting for the plants to mature enough to endure experiments through the winter PERIOD Arboretum student worker Andrew Zarzar tends to Future Garden on weekends.Its really important to observe the impact of the different climates PERIOD In the future the climates not always going to be the same Zarzar said PERIOD To actually have students work on it it really benefits the students and shows them they can make a difference.To mimic climate change each dome has a temperature set  degrees Celsius higher than current weather pattern averages PERIOD Botanists and UCSC students planted the  species both randomly and in familiar groups PERIOD Between each dome the water supply varies from heavy rain to droughtlike and variable rainfall.The art and science combination is useful because it helps nonscientific people and nonartistic people in a very visual way to see what weather change can do said Quigley executive director of the arboretum PERIOD The  plants act as a base for other plants to grow upon PERIOD This growth would create a building block for the sustenance of other organisms like birds and insects PERIOD This step would further the Harrisons goal of creating an ecosystem able to survive and adapt as the climate changes. each dome is three degrees warmer than current temperatures PERIOD Water conditions ranging from heavy rain to droughtlike conditions PERIOD Photo by Christina Bulosan.The Harrisons exhibit looks at local California heatadapted plants some of which have medicinal properties used by the Amah Mutsun Muwekma Ohlone and Miwok PERIOD The domed garden includes coast buckwheat lizard tail foothill sage and California aster PERIOD Brett Hall California native plant program director at the arboretum helped organize and now oversees the maintenance of Future Garden.Its not so much a strict scientific project Hall said but its more showing people and alerting people to what some of the potential changes might be.Founding director of the Institute of Arts and Sciences John Weber and program curator Rachel Nelson contributed to Future Garden as curators and project managers.Its a piece that the artists intend to bring hope with Weber said PERIOD The piece is trying to say that even on a smaller level there are things that can be done to mitigate the effects of climate change.By providing programs and exhibitions like Future Garden UCSC students can see the impact of climate change on local plants and have an opportunity to study climate change in an artistic way PERIOD

City on a Hill Press is produced by and for UCSC students PERIOD Our primary goal is to report and analyze issues affecting the student population and the Santa Cruz community PERIOD

We also serve to watchdog the politics of the UC administration PERIOD While we endeavor to present multiple sides of a story we realize our own outlooks influence the presentation of the news PERIOD The City on a Hill Press CHP collective is dedicated to covering underreported events ideas and voices PERIOD Our desks are devoted to certain topics campus and city news sports arts and entertainment opinion and editorial PERIOD CHP is a campus paper but it also provides space for Santa Cruz residents to present their views and interact with the campus community PERIOD Ideally CHPs pages will serve as an arena for debate challenge and ultimately change PERIOD

CHP is published weekly in the fall winter and spring quarters by the City on a Hill Press publishing group except during Thanksgiving and academic breaks PERIOD
