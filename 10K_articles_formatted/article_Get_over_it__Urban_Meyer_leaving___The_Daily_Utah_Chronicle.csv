Many Ute fans are to understate it extremely disappointed that Urban Meyer is leaving PERIOD  But cant we give him a little slack  Was it best to handle things the way he did  Perhaps not but would it have been better had he announced to his team and everyone else that he had taken the Florida job a month ago or whenever the deal was done  They might not even be in the Fiesta Bowl right now if he had it would have been a major distraction to the team PERIOD  Or should he have announced it following the Fiesta Bowl by the way Im no longer your coach PERIOD  This probably would have led to fans and the team feeling even more betrayed PERIOD  Cant we just take the positive out of this situation and quit begrudging Meyer  He took a mediocre football program and led it to greatness in just two years PERIOD  He took us to the BCS the first time in our history and the first time a mid major team has made it PERIOD  He did great things for the community as well as the school by getting us to be more involved in going to the games PERIOD  As for Notre Dame Meyer says the deal with Florida was already finished when Notre Dames offer was made PERIOD  We all have the choice of complaining endlessly about it or accepting it and moving on PERIOD  As with any situation in life the latter is better.Alan FonnesbeckSenior Psychology student
