Visiting downtown Knoxville three or four years ago would have been a different experience than it is today PERIOD

The scenery has changed as various new businesses have come to the area PERIOD The atmosphere and sense of community in areas of Knoxville like the Old City and Market Square draw these businesses downtown according to the owners of two such stores PERIOD

Theres just a certain kind of feeling you get when youre downtown said Scott Schimmel coowner of Bliss and Bliss Home both of which are located in Market Square PERIOD

Schimmel and coowner Lisa Sorensen opened Bliss a little over two years ago PERIOD Both had desired to own their own businesses and decided that they could fill a void in Knoxville PERIOD They wanted to provide a store that featured jewelry gifts and home accents PERIOD

We had always said I wish a cool store would open Schimmel said PERIOD

In opening the store they took cues from places like Metropolitan Deluxe Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel but they did not try to conform to any specific pattern in the store Schimmel said PERIOD

When trying to decide where to locate Schimmel and Sorensen settled on Market Square PERIOD The area was less expensive and they saw the potential that it had PERIOD Furthermore having lived in Knoxville for several years they saw an opportunity to help the city PERIOD

We wanted to do our part in the revitalization of downtown Schimmel said PERIOD

If owning one business in Market Square was fun for the pair then two would be even better PERIOD They opened a second store just a few weeks ago PERIOD Bliss Home is right across the Square from the original and focuses specifically on furniture PERIOD The idea for the second store came from the success of selling furniture in the original Schimmel said PERIOD They also wanted to show people that they were committed to selling furniture PERIOD

Since their arrival in Market Square they have seen more and more people come to the area PERIOD The increased population is twofold Schimmel said PERIOD

We have a lot of residents down here and the foot traffic has certainly increased he said highlighting that many people travel from other parts of the city to shop in the area PERIOD He added that every few months a new business opens as well PERIOD

The area should be growing more over the next few years as a new Regal theater opens and a 692space parking garage is built PERIOD A general store will also be opened in the area PERIOD

We couldnt be more excited about the future Schimmel said PERIOD

The Old City also offers the charm of downtown Knoxville according to Christa Dansereau who owns a store called Indigo with her husband PERIOD

The couple opened Indigo in the Old City in August  after they were previously located in both the Bearden area and on Cumberland PERIOD Locating in the Old City however allowed them to operate Indigo more like a boutique PERIOD They could focus more on the products that they liked and wanted to sell PERIOD

Indigo carries many different name brand clothes including BCBG and Silver PERIOD It also offers various other items from handmade jewelry to drawer pulls to soap PERIOD They strive to sell things that people want and cant find other places Dansereau said PERIOD With her husband she went to boutique stores in places like Charleston and Savannah to get inspiration PERIOD

We just felt like there was a need for it she said PERIOD We went out there in search of those things and tried to bring them to Knoxville PERIOD

Everything we have we truly try to focus on it being unique and different. dansereau sees much hope in the future of the Old City PERIOD

Im encouraged PERIOD It does seem that more retail is coming into the Old City she said PERIOD We have a lot of little homegrown places PERIOD Were really pushing for the small business person. log In
