Generally clear skies PERIOD Low 42F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Most people like chocolate PERIOD This is not exactly a controversial statement PERIOD It is proudly laid out next to checkout registers at grocery stores enticing shoppers to add just one more item to their already full cart thoughtlessly given as an arbitrary reward by teachers to students who answer questions correctly and all too often is associated with love sex and romance PERIOD See any store front display on or near Valentines Day if you doubt me PERIOD

The at times fascist fascination with the stuff is enough to make a man sick PERIOD I do not like chocolate PERIOD In fact I would dare to say I loathe it with as many fibers of my being as possible PERIOD It brings no pleasure to my tongue only bitter disgust PERIOD The smell alone is enough to raise the threat of my lunch suddenly becoming decoration for whatever floor I happen to be situated above and the texture is something out of nightmares PERIOD Gooey sticky melting between fingersit is truly an abysmal scourge PERIOD

Now I would not be so arrogant to assume my own tastes speak for everyone as they clearly do not but there is a deeper obsession with chocolate beyond any of its physical attributes PERIOD Folks live for the stuff PERIOD They find it strange how anyone should disagree with them PERIOD I cannot recount how many times in my life I have politely refused an offering of Reeses Hersheys or any other widelyloved chocolates only to be met with glaring eyes of fire and the all too familiar question PERIOD



I am here to answer you all with one sweeping word nothing PERIOD Chocolate is a food unlike any other in how it has been assigned a cultural significance completely separate from anything our five senses can perceive PERIOD In the eyes of its staunchest lovers to hate chocolate is to hate comfort sweet sugary relief from an uncaring world and in the most idealistic cases romance PERIOD I can happily confirm to you all I lack nothing for not relishing in the sticky gunk marketed as 

Fever over the treat is nothing new PERIOD Cultivation of the cacao tree began in ancient times in what is now Central America PERIOD Beans from the tree were left to ferment and be mixed with spices to make drinks PERIOD These drinks had many cultural uses and caught the eye of European colonizers in the sixteenth century PERIOD Cacao beans were taken back to Europe where they were sweetened instead of fermented and it is from this practice the modern usage of chocolate was derived PERIOD Since then chocolate has only grown in popularity PERIOD Market demand led to colonial nations using slave labor to speed production and the Industrial Revolution only helped this goal PERIOD

Today chocolate is marketed to us almost effortlessly due its foothold in the zeitgeist PERIOD Walking MMs are as recognizable figures as Mickey Mouse or Bugs Bunny PERIOD The green MM was even sexualized to arouse interest in the brand PERIOD Kit Kat bars have a jingle which is almost enthralling if left unfinished begging any who hear the melody to hum the last few notes PERIOD

Marketing conspiracies aside chocolate is also just not good for you PERIOD Commercial varieties are packed with sugar and fat for flavor and little else of any nutritional worth PERIOD According to Lisa Drayer of CNN chocolate while having some health benefits can be quite detrimental to ones health if eaten in copious amounts PERIOD

Drayer explains 

So chocolate is good until it is not PERIOD Noted PERIOD Let us take a look at portioning then PERIOD Surely most people are good at moderating their intake of any sort of luxury item right

Well maybe not PERIOD The FDA does not recommend any sort of daily consumption of chocolate due to the likelihood of having added sugars when sold commercially PERIOD Excessive sugars in ones diet is known to contribute to obesity which in turn leads to health complications in almost every imaginable field PERIOD

Added sugars in chocolate have been a focal point of debate among school districts for years PERIOD In her article Chris Henry of The Kitsap Sun reports how the Kitsap Public Health District decided to continue toallow chocolate milkin public schools in the district due to fears of students drinking less milk which has been shown to have positive health benefits especially for growing adolescents overall PERIOD Kitsap County decided not to go with plain milk only despite Henry reporting how a quarter of eightgraders in the county were overweight or obese PERIOD I find it difficult to see why adding cocoa and sugar to something like milk is even up for debate when it has no tangible benefits and in fact might have very negative side effects for growing children PERIOD

Chocolate might be the thing you look forward to most in your day PERIOD It might be just a happy surprise which makes you smile and is then forgotten about completely as it slides down your gullet PERIOD Regardless of its particular importance to your life it is unfair to assume everyone shares your feelings PERIOD And that is fine PERIOD It is okay for us to disagree PERIOD However the next time someone does not see the joy in smearing sweetened mud on their lips do not just assume they are the owners of malfunctioning taste buds PERIOD Do not ask what is wrong with them PERIOD Instead ask what chocolate has done for you lately PERIOD
