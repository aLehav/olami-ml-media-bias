Greeting card writer Leo Mark Hatmaker is lamenting his recently rejected

marriage proposal PERIOD Eva Lisa Hatmaker his prospective bride answers him

with a slap in the face PERIOD He is interrupted in his monologue by various

drunken revelers from the party PERIOD

It is evident from the start that Leos love for Eva has been a mistake all

along  evident that is to everyone but Leo PERIOD Great pains are taken in the

script to present Evas  nature PERIOD She keeps her dates organized

by morning afternoon and evening PERIOD To help Leo get his mind off his

troubles his boss Ed John Tuck invites him home to spend the holiday

with the Charles family PERIOD This turns out to be a loaded prospect  Eds

inlaws redefine the word 

This is one of Hatmakers funnier comedies PERIOD The first act drags a bit but

the tempo speeds up when Leo and Ed leave the office PERIOD Oneliners zip by

relentlessly begging for rimshot punctuation PERIOD Many of the puns are

groaners but most of the gags are fresh and funny PERIOD When Leo tells Ed

 Ed replies 

The supporting cast helps to make this a fun production PERIOD John Tuck is

properly droll as Leos qualityminded boss Ed PERIOD Nancy Harless carries off

two very different roles with enthusiasm showing a relaxed and effective

acting style PERIOD Hatmakers Leo is somewhat onedimensional for a lead

character though he carries some of the plays better gags PERIOD The standout

cast member is Sanjay Guha PERIOD He plays several entertaining support roles

Leos Amwayselling imaginary childhood friend a moneyconscious mugger

and a tomato showing skill at comedy performance PERIOD

Overall The Trouble With Christmas is a fun way to spend a holiday

evening PERIOD
