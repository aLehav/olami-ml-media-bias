9680,2021-06-07,"during the spring semester Eric Sanchez Lopez  and his roommates left their window open in Tom  Mary Ward Hall to soon find out that birds had let themselves in PERIOD

We kept hearing loud chirps in the mornings and just thought it was the birds on campus being loud Sanchez Lopez said PERIOD I decided to look out the window one of those days and I noticed a bird had started building a nest on the window. sanchez Lopez and his three other roommates did not want to disturb the birds so they allowed them to build a nest in between the window and the screen on the exterior of the window PERIOD The birds continued growing the nest and it got larger over the course of the semester PERIOD

They ended up laying  eggs and before I left campus  babies hatched and I just learned another one hatched since Ive been home Sanchez Lopez said PERIOD

As the semester was winding down the eggs laid by the birds began to hatch PERIOD Two of the eggs havent hatched but the apartment window on the North End of campus now has three chicks living in it PERIOD

Me and my roommates are just worried about what will happen to the birds after we leave during the summer especially since we are graduating this weekend Sanchez Lopez said PERIOD

The apartment of seniors is not sure what Housing will do with the chicks and the bird nest once they graduate and leave on the weekend of May  PERIOD Marist does not have specific policies outlined and the roommates were not trying to keep the chicks a secret from Housing PERIOD

The Resident Director RD of ward hall was fine with the birds when we told them about them but we dont know what Marist or housing will do when they discover them Sanchez Lopez said PERIOD

Housing did not immediately respond to requests for a comment on what will be done to the chicks once the students leave Tom  Mary Ward Hall for the semester PERIOD
