In hopes of chasing down a topthree research institution ranking the University of Minnesota is undergoing its biggest building boom in more than  years PERIOD The University is making the development push under the belief that state of the art research facilities will attract top faculty and students from around the world PERIOD But development isnt cheap PERIOD By the time the dust settles the University will have completed at least  billion in facilities development and renovation over the next five to  years Director of Project Management Orlyn Miller said PERIOD In that time span the University has plans to construct or renovate TCF Bank Stadium Bell Museum of Natural History Center for Magnetic Resonance Research three new biomedical labs Northrop Auditorium Science Teaching and Student Services building McNamara Alumni Center Weisman Art Museum and Recreation Center PERIOD Generally the state funds twothirds of development costs for University facilities and the University picks up the rest of the tab PERIOD With the economy in a tailspin some of the projects that arent yet funded are at risk however the projects that already have funding wont be affected Miller said PERIOD There is some caution looking forward as to whether we can maintain this in the short term until the economy can get back on its feet Miller said PERIOD The University is also working on design and planning for a new physics and nanotechnology building that will be built on the soccer fields at the south end of Cooke Hall PERIOD The building will cost about  million and has not yet been funded but the plan will be brought before legislators in  Miller said PERIOD Fairview is also planning to construct an Ambulatory Care Center on University property near the Superblock on Fulton Street PERIOD Fairview will own the building but a large amount of University Faculty will work at the center Miller said PERIOD Add a light rail train with stations and these additions will change the face of the University PERIOD Its safe to say that in my tenure here and historically this is one of the most rapidly developing times that weve seen Miller said PERIOD Science Teaching and Student Services building Cost . million Construction begins January  Completion Fall  While some professors who are teaching in the Science Classroom building are not thrilled with the construction and limited access to the Washington Avenue Bridge  many welcome the prospect of new facilities on campus PERIOD New facilities relate directly to highprofile faculty said Henricus Hogenkamp a retired biochemistry professor PERIOD When Hogenkamp started in the 1970s as the head of the College of Biological Sciences the University was in a rebuilding phase developing science labs near Coffman Union PERIOD He said that time period is similar to the Universitys current building boom PERIOD The administration suddenly realized if you want to do good science you need good facilities Hogenkamp said PERIOD Central Corridor LightRail Line Cost about  million not University funded Construction begins  Completion  The University originally wanted the light rail to skirt the north side of campus but it ended up settling for a proposal that has it rolling straight down Washington Avenue Miller said PERIOD With stops on the West Bank and East Bank the light rail will provide students with a great way to travel and utilize mass transit Miller said PERIOD But the prospect of the train has also stirred up some controversy PERIOD Once the light rail is completed Washington Avenue will be closed to all car traffic from Pleasant Street to Walnut Street PERIOD This could funnel a large amount of traffic onto East River Road Miller said but Washington Avenue will still be open to campus connectors bicycles and foot traffic PERIOD The light rail is also causing headaches for University researchers who have labs near Washington Avenue PERIOD The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance facility housed in Nils Hasselmo Hall  will have to be moved because the equipment is extremely sensitive to vibration that light rail trains produce facility director Beverly Ostrowski said PERIOD Medical labs Cost  million Construction Begins  Completion  The state has agreed to fund  percent of the construction for three new buildings that have potential to be major money and research producers Miller said PERIOD Once the complex is finished it will be home to a cancer research lab a cardiology lab an infectious disease lab and an expansion to the Center for Magnetic Resonance and Research PERIOD The construction for the new labs and the research they will eventually produce will pump a lot of money into the state Miller said PERIOD This is not just about the University Miller said PERIOD Its going to have some big economic impacts statewide. tCF Bank Stadium Cost about  million Construction began Summer  Completion Fall  When finished TCF Bank Stadium will have a maximum capacity of  and will likely have a light rail station and new parking structure sites nearby PERIOD The new stadium is about more than just football its about the campus experience University Regent David Metzen said PERIOD If it were all about football I never would have voted for it Metzen said PERIOD Its a heck of a lot of money for seven or eight games a year. the University was fortunate to receive so much funding from the state before the economy crisis hit Metzen said PERIOD Could you imagine going over there now and asking for a new stadium Metzen said PERIOD Its going to be ugly at the Legislature next year. get
