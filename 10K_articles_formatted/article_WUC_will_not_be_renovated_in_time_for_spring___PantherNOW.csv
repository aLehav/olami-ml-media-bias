Students that have been waiting for the renovated Wolfe University Center to be inaugurated must wait a few more months PERIOD

It has been undergoing renovations since this summer and was set for spring  completion but the ribbon cutting will not be held until midtolate March because of an expansion in scope according to Director of Student Affairs at WUC Scott Jones PERIOD

The scope of the project is the final product expectations PERIOD It involves all components of the renovation including lighting audio seating paint work and carpeting PERIOD

The renovation has consisted of two phases the first consisted of demolition and was meant to be completed in October while the second phase was meant to be completed by December so that the ribbon cutting could be held by the start of spring semester PERIOD

However due to the expansion in scope of phase two mainly dealing with the ceilings and floors phase ones demolition had to be expanded for a month to accommodate and phase two did not begin until Thanksgiving break PERIOD

Weve expanded the furnishing carpeting the ceiling work and we are now painting the entire building said Jones who has held his position since April PERIOD pullquoteThe scope increased so we needed to increase the timeline in regards to scheduling to make it all look new.pullquote

To Jones however worrying about aesthetics is not the only thing on his list PERIOD

He wants the purpose of the WUC to be changed and the space to be activated differently. he wants people to feel more comfortable while lounging or studying at the facilities and emphasizes that removing the concrete structures and replacing them with glass panes will allow them to see the space and react with people differently throughout the center PERIOD

Back when the building was utilized differently as an openspace environment there was a lot of precast concrete structures needed for architectural purposes PERIOD The exterior corridors served as a navigation pathway into an airconditioned space but this changed PERIOD

Once the building became fully airconditioned those concrete structures still stood and that impacted peoples line of sight and their experience of interaction said Jones PERIOD

The glass panes that will improve the sight throughout the WUC like Jones says should all be up by the end of the year PERIOD

According to some students this is a more bearable part of the renovation process in comparison to the loud demolition phase over summer PERIOD

But some students still find inconveniences although less noisy PERIOD

The construction limits our routes when it comes to walking around campus said Camilo Londono senior journalism major PERIOD Last week the computer lab and game rooms were closed and now you have to take a detour to go to the library from the bookstore. pullquoteWhen Im running late to class I think I might be able to use the hallway that leads out to the library but some days its closed and some it isnt.pullquote

Some students find the inconveniences to be minimal and prefer waiting a bit longer for a WUC that is thoroughly restructured PERIOD

Though the construction can be a bit tedious I think it will ultimately be good for the campus said Miriam Arias senior broadcasting media major PERIOD I dont have an issue with the delay of the set date as long as the finished product is good. quality is also a priority of the Student Government Association who has funded over  million of the  million project PERIOD

This makes the WUCs renovation the SGAs largest funded project according to Rafael Zapata Student Government Association advisor PERIOD

In addition to expanding the scope of the project it is very important to have the renovations done properly said Richard Azimov vice president of SGABBC since April PERIOD

To Jones this delay guarantees proper renovations making the wait worthwhile PERIOD Lounge areas will be available in every floor as well as in between floors and touch screen technology will be eventually set up in certain areas PERIOD

When folks walk in through the front door they will have a completely different experience as they walk through or around the building said Jones PERIOD They will be able to see all the way up to the third floor as soon as soon as they walk in. at the Bay
