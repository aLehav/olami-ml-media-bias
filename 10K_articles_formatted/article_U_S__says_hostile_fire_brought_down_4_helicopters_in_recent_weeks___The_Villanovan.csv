The Saturday truck bomb in a Baghdad market and Maj PERIOD Gen PERIOD William Caldwells admission Sunday of militants success against U.S PERIOD airpower told the story of a deepening crisis here even as Iraqi officials prepare to implement their new security plan and additional American troops come riding into town PERIOD

In a separate announcement Sunday afternoon U.S PERIOD military officials said the security plan would start Monday and expand over coming days and weeks PERIOD

Tense emotions spilled over into parliament where Shiite representatives stormed out en masse as Speaker Mahmoud alMashhadani a polarizing Sunni tried to read a telegram about the recent battle in Najaf PERIOD In a fierce argument that preceded the walkout Shiites said he needed to be working to prevent bombings not reading telegrams into the record from an unknown person as Abdul Kareem alEenizi of the 128member Shiitedominated United Iraqi Alliance shouted from his seat PERIOD

You are to run the session but not make decisions for us yelled another Alliance parliamentarian Sami alAskari PERIOD You have no right to interrupt the speech of any of us

Keep your advice for yourself the speaker yelled back PERIOD Give your advice to the prime minister The prime minister Nouri alMaliki is Shiite PERIOD

Mashhadani gaveled the session to a close as the Alliance members packed their papers and briefcases PERIOD They have not said publicly whether they would continue their protest PERIOD

Caldwell the U.S PERIOD militarys chief spokesman told reporters at a press conference behind the walls and checkpoints of Baghdads Green Zone that investigations into the copter crashes were still under way and he couldnt say how each was shot down PERIOD Eyewitnesses had already reported seeing three of the helicopters crash after taking hits from ground fire PERIOD

Two were Apache attack helicopters that went down in battles Jan PERIOD  and Feb PERIOD  each killing two PERIOD Twelve people most from National Guard units died Jan PERIOD  when a Black Hawk transport helicopter crashed in Diyala province PERIOD And four Blackwater security contractors died when their light combat helicopter crashed in Baghdad Jan PERIOD  PERIOD The same firefight killed another Blackwater gunner in a second helicopter PERIOD

The investigation of each of those is ongoing but it does appear that they were all the result of some kind of antiaircraft ground fire that did bring those helicopters down Caldwell said PERIOD Obviously based on what we have seen we were already making adjustments in our tactics and techniques and procedures. in a roundtable discussion with reporters on a military base near the Baghdad airport U.S PERIOD military officials announced that an Iraqi command structure for the Baghdad Security Plan would be in place Monday led by Lt PERIOD Gen Aboud Qanbar PERIOD

The plan will begin small and slowly escalate said Col PERIOD Douglass Heckman senior adviser to the ninth Iraqi Army division which operates east of the Tigris River where the sprawling Shiite slum of Sadr City is located PERIOD

Its going to be different than anything weve done before Heckman said PERIOD There are going to be a lot more boots on the ground a lot more integration. heckman Col PERIOD Chip Lewis senior adviser to the National Police headquarters and Col PERIOD Stuart Pollock senior adviser to the sixth Iraqi Army Division said the plan would comprise a larger presence of troops a new command structure and a longer time in place PERIOD

In previous Baghdad security plans insurgents retook neighborhoods after the military left PERIOD

Our mission is to bring stability to Iraq Lewis said PERIOD

Heckman said the plan would give a perception of sectarian balance acknowledging Sunni fears that the plan would target them to a greater degree than Shiite militias PERIOD

Lewis said the Iraqi forces are now mixed PERIOD At least one of two national police division commanders in Baghdad is Sunni and Sunnis head four of eight national police brigades PERIOD

The Baghdad security plan would set up at least one joint security station where U.S PERIOD and Iraqi security forces would work together in each of the nine districts of the capital PERIOD The hope is that Iraqis would turn to security forces for protection in their neighborhoods rather than Shiite or Sunni sectarian forces PERIOD

Lewis said all national police brigades are being retrained PERIOD In the past three months  Iraqi National police have either been fired reassigned or forced into retirement in an effort to cleanse the system Lewis said PERIOD Local Iraqi police have not been purged he said PERIOD

Are we where we want to be No PERIOD Are we making steady progress Yes he said PERIOD

Heckman acknowledged that there was political pressure when it came to the slums of Sadr City where some  million Shiites live under control of the Mahdi Army a sectarian militia PERIOD The security forces may take a more nimble approach there rather than the air and land siege that has already happened in some Sunni areas of the capital PERIOD

We do have restrictions Heckman said PERIOD But he added Our mission is to bring stability to Iraq PERIOD If we feel well have to clear Sadr City to do that then we will. your donation will support the student journalists of The Villanovan with technological needs training etc
