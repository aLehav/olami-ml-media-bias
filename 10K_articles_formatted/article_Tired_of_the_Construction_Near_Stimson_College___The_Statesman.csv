As a resident of Stimson College my year has been ruined by the ongoing construction in what was once known as the Roosevelt Cafe PERIOD Next year it will be the site of a new dorm but at the moment it is a source of pain and anguish for me and everyone else in the building PERIOD

Our list of complaints is never ending power blackouts without warning fire alarms blaring at  a.m. repeated hot water shutoffs again sometimes without warning and the jackhammering and bulldozing at six in the morning two hours earlier than theyre supposed to start PERIOD Worst of all there was a gas leak last semester some of us received text messages warning us but also many who didnt PERIOD Even still those who got a message werent given any hint of what to do PERIOD Basically it all seems like a doomed project completely mismanaged from the start PERIOD The construction is driving everyone crazy and putting us in danger PERIOD

The management of this project is at best a pain and at worse a reason why everyone is moving out of the building next year PERIOD Why cant Stony Brook wait until the summer or at least manage their project better

As a transfer from SUNY Cortland my building freshman year was right next to a construction site PERIOD My only complaint was the noise and at the end of the semester the school gave each of us a refund check for the trouble PERIOD They acknowledged the hassle and did what they could to make up for it PERIOD

Stony Brook however has simply told us to put up with it without even trying to listen PERIOD Theyve done a horrible job of trying to accommodate us and have shown again theyre all about the money with this new expansion. so it seems for the rest of us in the worst part of campus Stony Brook will continue to leave us in the dark PERIOD

A senior at Stony Brook who wishes to remain anonymous PERIOD He lives in Stimson PERIOD
