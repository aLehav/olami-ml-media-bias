7940,2021-03-13,"the University of Alabamas Office of Information Technology recently added a secure wireless network for student use however its addition was prompted more for basic security measures than overall faster connectivity Vice Provost John McGowan said PERIOD

Wireless networking presents a real and unique set of security challenges McGowan said PERIOD In general though cases of abuse of open wireless networks are commonplace and so there is no reason to think we would be safe from it. in the past students have been forced to connect with these open wireless networks like UA Public and UA ResNet PERIOD This gives unauthorized users the ability to eavesdrop and capture sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers McGowan said PERIOD

The new secure network UAWPAPSK is protected with a password that users must provide to gain initial access PERIOD

WPAPSK is easy for users to set up and use and yet provides a reasonable level of encryption and some basic access control from the network he said PERIOD

Some students upon receiving the Universitys email this Monday introducing the new network thought this meant Internet connection on campus would subsequently improve PERIOD

Elie Zeitouni a freshman majoring in management information systems first tested the network in the Alston building and was pleased when he compared connection speeds of older networks using speedtest.com a public website used to measure Internet connection speed PERIOD

The download speeds for the old networks were steady at  megabits per second and the upload speed was consistent with one megabit per second Zeitouni said PERIOD The new network reached speeds that averaged at  megabits per second for both download and upload. while these new speeds seemed promising they did not hold true for Internet connection in his Riverside dorm room returning back to the normal  megabits per second for download speed PERIOD

Students will probably see improved speeds in the classroom but not as much in the dorm unless something changes he said PERIOD My advice to the University would be to provide faster cable to dorms to improve upload speeds for at least wired connections. the campus has over  wireless access point devices installed across campus and each can support up to  user sessions but this number is highly dependent upon the type of network traffic demanded McGowan said PERIOD

If several people are connected to the same wireless access point as you and they are doing video streaming sessions like Netflix you will probably not get a very good connection he said PERIOD

Living on campus all four years Claire Davis a senior majoring in English said dorm room wireless connection has always been more of a problem than campuswide Internet speed but security is more of her top priority PERIOD

While the new network still tends to work more consistently in other areas of campus aside from the dorms the new secure connection is a great improvement because I can finally believe my private information is protected Davis said PERIOD","New wireless network faster, more secure â€“ The Crimson White",University of Alabama
