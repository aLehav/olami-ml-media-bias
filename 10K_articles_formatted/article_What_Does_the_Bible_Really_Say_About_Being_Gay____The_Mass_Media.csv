One could attest to the fact that this century is the best time to be alive PERIOD We have cutting edge technology and have made great advancements in science and health PERIOD On average we live longer PERIOD Women have more freedom and occupy more leadership roles PERIOD Democracy is on the rise PERIOD And now more than ever before we seem to be concerned about environmental and social issues PERIOD

However great opportunities come with great challenges PERIOD Yes we have made progress but on the other hand there has been a surge in divisive and controversial social issues PERIOD Gay rights is one of them and different beliefs have caused hostility between people PERIOD

According to a Sept PERIOD  article from the Washington Post by Philip Bump  percent of Americans think that that samesex relationships should be illegal PERIOD There are political leaders in this country who share the same view Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore is one of them PERIOD A common justification for such hostility is that the Bible forbids samesex relations and those who are against it just want to uphold their religious values PERIOD But what does the Bible really say

Someone who is religious might turn to the Bible for answers on controversies PERIOD For some religious people the Bible is the final authority and they must follow what it says PERIOD However the Bible is not a book that can be taken literally PERIOD For one it was translated and many words and ideas got lost in translation PERIOD Its also full of inconsistencies PERIOD

The biblical text that is often used to condemn homosexuality is found in Genesis  PERIOD It tells the story of the people of Sodom who wanted to know some angel visitors that Lot had over his house PERIOD In a biblical context to know someone is to engage in sexual intimacy with them PERIOD As a result of their sinful ways Yahweh destroyed Sodom PERIOD

When reading the story however there is nothing that suggests its about samesex relations PERIOD The confusion arose because the word men got lost in translation PERIOD In Hebrew the word anasim means both men and people PERIOD The men of Sodom call for the two men in Lots house to be sent out so the crowd may know them and the people of Sodom call for the people in Lots house to be sent out so the crowd may know them would be the exact same sentence in Hebrew PERIOD However replacing the word people with men tells two very different stories PERIOD One could easily see why interpreters might think the story of Sodom was about homosexuality PERIOD

Translation and context are both something that one must examine when reading the Bible PERIOD To fully understand the biblical text that made references to samesex relations one must take into account its Hebrew translation as well as the world that the authors were living in PERIOD

The story of Sodom might after all be a story about hospitality PERIOD It ought to teach the people of Sodom how to treat visitors and not take advantage of them PERIOD Its an injustice to the biblical text to interpret and rationalize it in order to discriminate against a group of people PERIOD

One might never know why in todays world such feelings of hostility exist but one can agree that its culturally conditioned not intellectual PERIOD The Bible can be used as a compass but at the end of the day we can decide whats moral or not based our own world and our own realities PERIOD
