It took an overnight stay in the hospital and a saline bag for me to collect my thoughts this weekend PERIOD

The crippling abdominal pains elicited guttural pleading groans PERIOD But by the time the pain had subsided a few hours later doubts leaked through my consciousness to the slow drip of the IV PERIOD

After a day and a half of vomiting diarrhea and dehydration I felt like I was getting better PERIOD I kept drinking water and ginger ale and the cereal and soup I ate didnt resurface PERIOD

But I wasnt out of the woods yet PERIOD Late Sunday evening I doubled over with a cross between an Olympicsized stomach cramp and a stab wound PERIOD

A CAT scan revealed my appendix wasnt the problem PERIOD But my intestines were inflamed because of some type of bug PERIOD

The darndest thing is the pain all but ceased when the doctors stopped scratching their heads and decided to admit me for the night PERIOD

Who the heck really knows PERIOD

So while my hospital stay didnt include an emergency appendectomy I did get a private room watch Star Trek III The Search for Spock and receive hospital fare  hours after my appetite returned PERIOD

One of my roommates took me to the emergency room and waited with me by my request PERIOD Two others arrived and stayed in the ER room with me until my parents arrived PERIOD

I didnt want my parents to come to the hospital PERIOD That is drive nearly two hours from Cleveland to Erie in the worsening winter weather just to worry over me PERIOD

Their reason for filling up the gas tank was valid however PERIOD We dont know what this is they said PERIOD Its not like youre in here because you just need some stitches. i thought about that after they left for home around  p.m PERIOD or so PERIOD I couldnt come up with a better counterargument PERIOD

I made it almost a full four years living away from home without checking into the local infirmary PERIOD Thats highly unlikely considering the constant stomach issues Ive endured since senior year of high school PERIOD

But though Im a few months away hopefully from adult life I yearned for the comfort of my parents while I was writhing in pain PERIOD

For all of the walls labeled maturity and independence that I build between me and my parents on the inside I wanted them there PERIOD

On the cusp of adulthood I didnt feel like a grownup in that moment PERIOD

Even if my parents had listened to me and not come I still asked for my roommate who dropped me off to stay in the waiting room with me proving I didnt want to be alone PERIOD

Perhaps its just a natural desire to feel cared for when youre at your sickest but sadly I didnt feel uplifted or any more in touch with my inner being PERIOD

I felt like a child with a scrape on his knee PERIOD

For all the things Ill have to do on my own in the near future  yes even hospital visits  I hope my next performance is much better under pressure PERIOD
