Baby Tony and The Teenies play a set at the 2019Adverse Fest PERIOD This years festival will be held on March  and  PERIOD Erin Schilling eschillingrandb.com

Day two of Adverse Fest continued to showcase its diverse lineup with people from around the United States PERIOD The lineup included artists representing almost every genre in existence with a wide range of ethnicities and identities PERIOD

For attendees and performers the festival fills a muchneeded space in the music community PERIOD The festival was intended to give underrepresented artists a chance to reclaim part of the music scene which normally pushes them aside as a result of their ethnicity gender or sexual identity according to A.C PERIOD Carter a student pursuing an MFA in sculpture at the University of Georgia and the main organizer of Adverse Fest PERIOD

I wanted to think abstractly about how to create space for those who are continuously fringed  whether theyre a woman or somebody whos part of the LGBTQ community or someone whos gender nonconforming or someone whos a person of color or someone who just never feels like theyre ever a part of it all Carter said PERIOD

Carter wanted these artists to show audiences the performers deserve just as many opportunities as mainstream artists PERIOD They also have an affinity for solo and duo performances as well as electronic music experimental music and postpunk music which they paired with drag performances to create an evening of excitement and anticipation PERIOD

At Caledonia Lounge LGBTQ artists were the stars of the evening PERIOD Video Tronic and her Intrusive Thots Taylor Alxndr Diaspoura and Internet Boyfriend were all met with bobbing heads swaying bodies and entranced gazes PERIOD Couples clung together in the crowd dancing and swaying to the set PERIOD

Some attendees came to support friends such as Lawrence Carrasco a 27yearold attendee originally from San Fernando California PERIOD That and Carrascos love of indie music PERIOD

I have a close friend whos a drag performer and Im acquaintances with all the others Carrasco said PERIOD I saw they were booked for Adverse Fest and thats kind of what got me into it. many heard about the festival through friends and the mass amount of artists who performed at the twoday event PERIOD Charles Martinez of Internet Boyfriend an electrorap group based in Nashville said hes close friends with Carter PERIOD

We met in Nashville because Carter did their undergraduate there and we met a few years after they had graduated and we went on tour together last year Martinez said PERIOD

Becca Kauffman also known as Jennifer Vanilla plays vocal house music or what she calls technopop and is based in New York PERIOD She said she was surprised by how lively Athens was PERIOD

As the lights went down at Flicker Theatre  Bar Go Bar and Caledonia Lounge attendees tuned in to the music PERIOD During Baby Tony and The Teenies performance the tightknit crowd cozied up near the stage with a few people on the side dancing to the doowopinspired pop music PERIOD During Jennifer Vanillas performance audience members stood on the benches along the walls occasionally shouting out lyrics alongside the artist and laughing at her jokes PERIOD

Audience members responded well to the variety of musical talent leaving the night with artists they wanted to look into more PERIOD They also arrived with plenty of artists in mind whom they were looking forward to later in the evening PERIOD

Kayla Moore a 27yearold attendee from Nashville whose boyfriend is Mischa Lively an artist who performed on Friday said she was interested in seeing Jennifer Vanilla because she had heard great things about her PERIOD Moore also learned about other artists who she didnt know about previously PERIOD

I really loved the person who was onstage dancing with Diaspoura Moore said PERIOD Whoever they are was incredible PERIOD I just want to see them in a show by themselves just dancing PERIOD I loved them so much. mallory Mifflin a sophomore cognitive science major at UGA came because she heard about the festival from a friend PERIOD She learned about artists like Flesh Eater whose messages inspired her to think more openmindedly PERIOD

There are a lot of transgender themes throughout their message a lot of powerful messages Mifflin said PERIOD I dont know if a lot of people have trans awareness so for them to be so open about it I thought that was really cool. after performing on stage rather than leaving right away the artists decided to stay and support one another by attending each others shows and contributing all their positive energy PERIOD

Im really glad I played an early set just so I can get the grunt work done and catch all these amazing performers tonight Martinez said PERIOD

Even the artists had other artists they were looking forward to PERIOD Baby Tony and The Teenies were passionate about Eve Maret and Dream Chambers but they also enjoyed Abstract Black Karen Meat Eureka Californias and Diatom Delis performance PERIOD

Theres a lot of positive energy and the artists who are showing up are doing so well and I feel so thrilled Carter said PERIOD My heart is so big. carter hopes to host Adverse Fest again next year with even more artists of a greater variety PERIOD
