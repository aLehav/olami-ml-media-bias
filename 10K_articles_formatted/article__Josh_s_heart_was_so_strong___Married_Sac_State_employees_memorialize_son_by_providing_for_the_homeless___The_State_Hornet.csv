5754,2019-12-07,"after his son Josh died of liver failure at the age of  Don Nahhas was talking to his pastor about what they could do to help the people Josh cared about the most PERIOD

It was during that meeting that Don decided to start a project to put together and distribute blessing bags  backpacks filled with essentials for homeless people in the Sacramento community PERIOD

I wanted to do something to keep his memory alive for people in the same situation as he was said Don who works at Sacramento State as an administrative support coordinator PERIOD

They need grooming things PERIOD They need some food socks beanies gloves said Dons wife Dawn Nahhas who also works on campus as an editor for the U.S PERIOD Geological Survey PERIOD Were going to do things like blankets  everything they must need when theyre out in the elements. for Don and Dawn the needs of the homeless held a deep meaning as they had watched their son Josh struggle with alcoholism and homelessness before his death on August  PERIOD

He was in and out of sober living and programs Dawn said PERIOD He was homeless a lot of the time when he was addicted PERIOD  His liver couldnt take anymore and he went in throwing up blood and had complete liver failure then multisystem failure because of it. dawn said that her son was able to stop drinking before but that when he started again he was afraid of going through detoxing because of a seizure he had when he tried to quit cold turkey PERIOD

If youre not treated medically thats what happens with withdrawal for alcoholics she said PERIOD He got sober for a little bit again but just one beer got him back into the cycle. according to his parents Josh did what he could to help others so much so that when he got an apartment through Lutheran Social Services several months before he died he let other people sleep there PERIOD

If he had something if he got food he tried to share it with anyone said Don PERIOD He always took care of the people on the street with him and if there was someone older than him someone whocouldnt move around as much Joshs heart was so strong for other people that he would just take care of them. don said that helping their son with his experience of alcoholism and homelessness gave him a new perspective on those who suffer from them PERIOD

After Josh passed away it helped me to look at homeless people and addicts differently  theyre somebodys son or daughter brother or sister cousin nephew uncle whatever  and ultimately theyre Gods child Don said PERIOD I wanted to help people understand that you may look at this person on the street thats homeless drunk or whatever but for one reason or another they got there. the Nahhas family has set up a website to solicit donations for the blessing bags a project they will be undertaking in union with their spiritual home Providence Church Sacramento which meets in Tahoe Elementary School on sixtieth St PERIOD and Broadway PERIOD

Sac State President Robert Nelsen announced in his Sept PERIOD  presidents message that he will be donating to the blessing bag project PERIOD Don said that he was shocked when he heard Nelsens announcement PERIOD

Don is a member of the Hornet Family PERIOD When he reached out to me about the charity they are creating in his sons memory I wanted to support him PERIOD  I understand the terrible loss that he has experienced said Nelsen who lost his own son Seth Nelsen when he took his own life in  PERIOD

Blessing bags wont only come in the form of backpacks however as the project will also put together Ziploc bags of grooming materials for homeless students at Hiram Johnson High School PERIOD

Don said that they are also planning to distribute blankets for the winter weather and that he understood the need for backpacks from his sons experience PERIOD

We would buy stuff for our son and there was just no place to carry it so he would stuff it away somewhere and some authoritative person would come gather up all the stuff and throw it in the trash Don said PERIOD Having the ability to carry it around with them hopefully will help them a little bit. dawn said she wants the bags to give hope to the recipients PERIOD

Each backpack is going to have a laminated tab on it that says inspirational things like Youre worthy Youre good enough Youre loved Dont give up things like that because a lot of the homeless are very discouraged and very hopeless she said PERIOD Josh said to me one time when he was sober You know Im having a hard time looking people in the eye because when youre homeless for so long he got used to looking away looking down because he felt unworthy PERIOD

In his honor we want to help people out there and let them know theyre loved. your donation will support the student journalists of Sacramento State University PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
