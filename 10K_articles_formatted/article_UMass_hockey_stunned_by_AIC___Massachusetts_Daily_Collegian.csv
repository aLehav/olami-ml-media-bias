What do UMass Lowell Boston College Boston University Merrimack Northeastern and the Massachusetts hockey team all have in common

All six Hockey East teams have suffered upsets from Atlantic Hockey foes this season PERIOD

Considered by far the weakest of the six Division I conferences in college hockey AHC teams rarely find themselves on the winning end in their nonconference slate but have found some relative success so far this season PERIOD

On Tuesday the Minutemen won the race to two losses to AHC teams in  falling to American International  in front of  at Mullins Center in their final nonconference game of the season PERIOD It was AICs firstever win over a Hockey East opponent PERIOD

UMass  outshot the Yellow Jackets by a whopping  margin for the game but could only beat AIC freshman goaltender Hunter Leisner twice in the contest PERIOD

The Minutemen fired  shots and hit three posts but Leisner carried the Yellow Jackets with a superhuman effort PERIOD

It can be a fickle game sometimes UMass coach John Micheletto said PERIOD We had  launches  shots on net we won the special teams battle won in the faceoff dot and we dont win the game PERIOD We gotta finish PERIOD I do know that PERIOD

At the end of the day Im very disappointed at the outcome especially since I was happy with a lot of the things we did over the course of the play he continued PERIOD Usually the end result dictates your opinion of everything else PERIOD Obviously their goaltender had a pretty good night. it didnt help the Minutemen that they were without one of their best passers and pacesetters in freshman Ray Pigozzi who also missed Sundays exhibition versus the U.S PERIOD Under18 National Team with an undisclosed ailment PERIOD

Defensively UMass held AIC  to just  shots for the game but defensive breakdowns particularly in the third period left Steve Mastalerz  saves helpless between the pipes which ultimately led to the Yellow Jackets gamewinning goal PERIOD

With the game tied at   minutes  seconds into the third period Jon Puskar blocked a shot and the puck popped out and onto the stick of David Norris who led a 2on1 break with Alexander MacMillan PERIOD Norris fed MacMillan with a crossice pass right to his stick and the junior buried the puck into an open net to give AIC a lead it wouldnt relinquish thanks in large part to its freshman net minder PERIOD

Leisner made a number of quality stops especially when he faced a 27shot barrage in the second period but also had plenty of opportunities come right at him while he was already in position PERIOD

Its definitely up there with the most Ive ever had Leisner said of the  shots he faced PERIOD The team they kept a lot of them out to the side PERIOD Probably about  to  of them were very routine saves where the team really helped me out especially with a few blocked shots that were key right in the slot. a lack of crowd noise made for a slow start to the game but the Minutemen still dominated the first period in terms shots  they held a  edge in the first  minutes  and had plenty of good chances including a Ben Gallacher attempt that hit the post and a Brennan Baxandall shot that hit off an AIC defenseman and beat Leisner but was ruled no goal because he ran into and dislodged the net before the puck could finish its slow journey past the goal line PERIOD

Michael Pereira netted the games first goal first  into the second period on the power play on a snap shot from the right circle PERIOD

The Minutemens active scoring leader Pereiras goal puts him two away from  for his career and four points away from  PERIOD It was also his eighteenth career powerplay goal tying him for third on UMass alltime list PERIOD

AIC answered just two minutes later when Jason Popek beat Mastalerz unassisted to tie the game at  and pulled ahead at  when Mike Dietrich scored a pretty goal on the rush to take a  lead PERIOD Dietrich received a pass from Nathan Sliwinski worked his way up ice and faked his way through the UMass defense before ripping a shot past Mastalerz for his first career goal PERIOD

UMass tied the game  into the third period when Steven Guzzo put home a rebound after Leisner made a kick save on Brandon Wahlins initial shot from the right wing PERIOD

UMass doesnt play again until Jan PERIOD  against Merrimack leaving them  days to dwell on a very low point for the program PERIOD

We wish we could get back at it tomorrow night Conor Sheary said PERIOD I know these guys in the room arent going to quit but its the will to get back at it PERIOD Its gonna be hard for  days at least. nick Canelas can be reached at emailprotected and followed on Twitter NickCanelas PERIOD
