Aidan OMalley  Monday November  

Here at The Observer there is one accomplishment one milestone one crown every writer and editor dreams of having the good fortune and fortitude to place upon their heads  the Golden Sombrero PERIOD

Awarded to those among us who have written for not just News  and not just Scene  but Sports and Viewpoint as well the Golden Sombrero is something to not just be celebrated but coveted PERIOD I take a perverse kind of pleasure in knowing that with this Sports Authority here I am polishing my Golden Sombrero in dare I say record time PERIOD Id like to thank my friends my family and the Academy PERIOD Ive dreamed of this day since I was a kid PERIOD

That being said strap in for the most bonkers Sports Authority this fine paper has ever published PERIOD Yes today I shall be ranking every sport I was forced to play as a child  and failed at PERIOD

Ive got lots of childhood trauma and parental dismay that I could unpack yet Ive debated the exact nature of my ranking criteria PERIOD Should I rank these athletic events from most despised to least From the one that I was the worst at to the best In order of magnitude of my fathers disappointment In the spirit of objectivity Ive settled on the first PERIOD Realistically I was probably equally bad at them all and my dad would never actually say he was disappointed in me PERIOD

This is a good place to clarify that to a degree this list is a joke PERIOD It is a Sportsadjacent goodnatured goof that fills the pages and dusts off my Sombrero PERIOD Let the record show I have a good loving home

What is most certainly not a joke is my complete and total lack of athletic ability PERIOD Every sport on this list I did in fact attempt  each one was promptly bombed PERIOD I hope this is proof that even those of us on the speech team in high school have a place in The Observers Sports section PERIOD

And with that were off to the races PERIOD

 PERIOD Karate

What was I thinking

 PERIOD Soccer

I feel like this is a quintessential toddler sport  the kind of summer activity your mom signs you up for when youre  years old and she cant handle your hyperactivity any longer PERIOD And to that extent has there ever been a sport better suited to wiping out a toddler than soccer

My memories of soccer are admittedly blurry  Im not sure Id developed object permanence yet  but I dont remember any like rules PERIOD I can recall only the scuffling of feet a cacophony of kicks and the treats we got at the end PERIOD

Oh but the treats Were talkin Capri Sun fruit snacks the whole nine yards Im sorry thats a really bad idiom to use in a Sports article PERIOD I also remember my local park district gave us shirts that could turn inside out depending on if we were playing for the blue team or the yellow one that day PERIOD

Otherwise this sport was super exhausting I never scored a goal or was taught how literally anything worked and no they have not yet developed a shin guard that can withstand a toddlers angry foot PERIOD Next PERIOD

 PERIOD Track

I ran track in middle school  seventh grade to be precise  which was painfully awkward because I was still at a point in my sad dork life where I associated sports with what the cool boys did PERIOD I simply could not be seen with those plebeians PERIOD I for one was alt PERIOD

Jokes aside track wasnt fun at all PERIOD At my middle school there didnt yet exist any activities or clubs that I was actually interested in save band because of course I was in band PERIOD So track was unironically the consequence of my parents twisting my arm and forcing me to play a sport PERIOD I had literally one friend on the team and I dreaded practice almost every day PERIOD Actual meets were even worse  I dont think I talked to anyone when I was there PERIOD

That being said this ranks higher on the list than it probably should because I actually wasnt bad at it PERIOD I literally went to middle school track regionals  for two races I sucked at the field events though and most of the time I wished I was I dont know watching anime or whatever it was that I did in seventh grade PERIOD Next PERIOD

 PERIOD Baseball

I stuck with baseball for a pretty long time mostly because I really liked watching it PERIOD I loved going to Chicago White Sox games as a kid and I loved watching them on TV too PERIOD I remember Dairy Queen used to serve ice cream in bowls shaped like little baseball caps and I collected them until I had every team in the MLB  I even sorted them between the National and American Leagues

But late in my time as a baseball player the pitcher hit me in the eye and I became deathly afraid of the ball PERIOD That pretty much crushed my athletic ambitions PERIOD

 PERIOD Basketball

This one I stuck with the longest because when I was little I was actually pretty good PERIOD But then puberty happened and my height was way too average PERIOD Next PERIOD

 PERIOD Golf

I think I liked this sport the most for a variety of deeply selfish reasons PERIOD

The first was that I considered golf as a very solitary sport  a sport I could do on my own and on my own time PERIOD Ive been described by my friends as an introvert who likes to talk so the slow small nature of golf seemed suited to my personality PERIOD I also liked it because it made me feel like an adult and not just an adult but a cool one PERIOD Or maybe just a rich one PERIOD

Im nearing  words PERIOD Goodbye
