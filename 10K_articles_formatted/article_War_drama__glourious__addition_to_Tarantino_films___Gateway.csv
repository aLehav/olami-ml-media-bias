What could excite American moviegoers more than fighting NazisHow about a movie about Nazi killing starring Brad Pitt under the direction of Quentin Tarantino one of the most criticized Hollywood directors of all time Inglourious Basterds will grab your attention right from the beginning and wont let you go until the explosive ending.This is a mustsee summer blockbuster I highly recommend PERIOD But I warn you this movie is not for the faint of heart PERIOD

With movies like Pulp Fiction Reservoir Dogs Grindhouse and the Kill Bill trilogy under his belt Tarantino holds nothing back in this fictional portrayal of JewishAmerican soldiers fighting for the survival of their race in Germanoccupied France.From the classic Tarantino opening to the climactic ending Inglourious Basterds is a noholdsbarred masterpiece filled with all of the action suspense and surprise we have come to expect from Quentin Tarantino PERIOD Like the rest of his films its highly graphic in nature and targeted for an adult audience PERIOD

Inglourious Basterds is packed with stars ranging from Brad Pitt to Samuel L PERIOD Jackson who colorfully narrates each scene PERIOD The movie even includes an unlikely cameo from funnyman Mike Myers who plays British General Ed Fenech a change from the highlypopular British spy Austin Powers PERIOD

Pitt plays the part of a halfNative American and halfJewish Lt PERIOD Aldo Raine who earns the nickname Aldo the Apache from a victory celebration that you will have to see to believe.Joining Raine in his mission to infiltrate German lines includes Sgt PERIOD Donny Donowitz played by Eli Roth and Pfc PERIOD Omar Ulmer played by B.J PERIOD Novak whom some might recognize from the NBCs hit comedy The Office. the most unforgettable character from the movie is that of Shoshanna Dreyfus played by Mlanie Laurent PERIOD She is responsible for avenging the deaths of her Jewish family at the hands of the German Col PERIOD Hans Landa Christoph Waltz PERIOD

This film has some of the most beautifully produced scenes I have ever seen mixed in with the same artistic integrity found in other Tarantino movies PERIOD The most notable scene is one in which the face of Dreyfus is projected onto a plume of smoke while ominous laughter rings out in the background PERIOD

Tarantino is known for colorful artistry but this movie is without a doubt the climax of his directorial career thus far and is unquestionably the kind of movie that will stand the test of time PERIOD

If you are looking for a movie full of action and suspense with a little comedy thrown in for good measure then look no further this is your movie PERIOD

However if you are a not a fan of Tarantinos farfetched movie stylings then this movie is not going to change your mind PERIOD It is full of the same ingredients that can be found in almost all of his films PERIOD

I walked away from Inglourious Basterds with a newfound respect for Tarantino not only for his highly imaginative mind but also for his amazing cinematography work PERIOD When the credits began to role I was left wanting more PERIOD
