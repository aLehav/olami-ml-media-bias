Nicole Bilyak  Thursday November  

Since its final airing in  Walt Disney Studios preschool channel Playhouse Disney has been all but radio silent for years PERIOD But a little thing called Disney came along and the streaming service began to gain several wellknown Playhouse Disney shows such as Rolie Polie Olie and Out of the Box. for years fans of Playhouse Disney have wanted Bear in the Big Blue House to join Disney PERIOD Finally on Oct PERIOD   Disney finally put all four seasons of Bear in the Big Blue House as well as all three seasons of PBJ Otter on the platform PERIOD With these two shows appearing on Disney it seems reasonable to look back on both shows see why they were so lovable back then and understand why they resurfaced now in  PERIOD

Bear in the Big Blue House aired in  and starred Noel MacNeal as the titular Bear who lives in a big blue house PERIOD The show utilized problemsolving sharing cooperation and developing life skills PERIOD The show was a massive success for kids who were preschool age and it was a larger success for those who were on the autism spectrum disorder PERIOD This comes from the fact that Bear has a caring attitude and was considered gentle especially with the gag of Bear sticking his nose into the camera and sniffing the viewers PERIOD

In an interview with Insider MacNeal stated that there was never a show quite like Bear in the Big Blue House. the show as stated earlier ran for only four seasons and there was a threeyear hiatus after the third season due to the fact that Lynne Thigpen who voiced Luna the Moon suddenly passed away in  PERIOD Later Tara Mooney who voiced Shadow claimed the crews hearts werent in the show anymore PERIOD So the show concluded with its fourth season in  PERIOD

On the flip side PBJ Otter was another very popular show that aired on Playhouse Disney PERIOD Premiering on Mar PERIOD   the show was about the Otter family particularly the three children Peanut Baby Butter and Jelly all named after a peanut butter and jelly sandwich PERIOD The shows structure introduced the idea of something called the Noodle Dance where Peanut Baby Butter and Jelly would have to think of something and to get the creative juices flowing PERIOD The three children would dance and would eventually find an idea that may or may not work PERIOD The show only aired for three seasons concluding on Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

I remembered watching both of these shows as well as the other two shows mentioned above when I was younger PERIOD But I remembered Bear in the Big Blue House the most because it was one of the more relaxing shows that really stood out to me PERIOD As an autistic I never really noticed that Bear was really gentle for those who were autistic PERIOD But now that I look back on the show I can really see it PERIOD I totally side with MacNeal saying the show was relaxing in that Bear had that sweet and endearing attitude toward any viewer of the show PERIOD With PBJ Otter I hardly remember the show but from what I can remember the show was quite wacky but still very cute PERIOD Since I watched the show when I was much younger I understood it more in my fiveyearold mind but now as a college student I still dont understand why the show was even that innovative PERIOD

Overall it is very nice to see that Disney is now bringing back all of the Playhouse Disney shows from the late 90s and now the younger generation can watch these shows anytime they want on Disney PERIOD
