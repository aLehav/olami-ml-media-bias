3713,2016-10-28,"on a cold rainy Thursday night No PERIOD  Boston College field hockey made the short trip to Cambridge Mass PERIOD for a pivotal top20 matchup against No PERIOD  Harvard PERIOD With the regular season winding down the Eagles were looking for a marquee win to carry some momentum into postseason play PERIOD Steady rain provided unfavorable field conditions leading to passes skipping long and jumping players sticks PERIOD With the rain wreaking havoc for the teams the Eagles capitalized on every opportunity to grind out a  win over the Crimson PERIOD

Harvard   Ivy came out of the gate firing in the first  minutes of the game with two scoring opportunities PERIOD BC   Atlantic Coast goaltender Audra Hampsch halted the efforts however with two great saves to keep the game scoreless PERIOD The Eagles countered in the following minutes with their first scoring chance that was thwarted by Harvard goaltender Libby Manela PERIOD As the game progressed not only did the rain increase but the scoring chances for Harvard also did as well PERIOD The Crimson continued to pepper Hampsch with shots the entire night outshooting the Eagles  to seven by the end of the night PERIOD But sometimes it doesnt matter who has more opportunitiesits about which team can take advantage of its chances PERIOD

With  minutes remaining in the first half BC made the most of its limited scoring chances as Ymke Rose Gote set up Brittany Sheenan to beat Manela for her ninth goal of the season giving the Eagles a  lead PERIOD The Crimson continued its counterattacks to even the score but to no avail PERIOD With  seconds left in the half on just the teams fourth shot of the game Emily McCoy cashed in her third goal of the season with an assist from Leah Frome increasing the Eagles lead to  as they headed to halftime despite being outshot seven to four PERIOD

Harvard came out of the break with just as much aggression as the first half PERIOD The Crimson was in control in the first  minutes of the second half with several shots and a twominute man advantage yet couldnt put the ball in the net thanks in part to another Hampsch save PERIOD Harvards failure to capitalize on these scoring opportunities was one of the main takeaways from this game PERIOD Lucy Lytle added onto the lead at the  mark and McCoy would tack on for her second goal of the game PERIOD A late Crimson goal was irrelevant to the outcome as the Eagles rolled past Harvard  PERIOD

The Crimson definitely left many goals on the field on Thursday night considering it outshot BC  and had the penalty advantage with  fouls to BCs  PERIOD Nevertheless despite the statistics BC capitalized on its few scoring opportunities to make the most of its offensive attacks on its way to a victory in the rain over another top20 opponent PERIOD
