The D.C PERIOD Fiscal Policy Institute published a report on Washington D.C.s public housing Jan PERIOD  citing a lack of federal funding as the leading cause of delay in affordable housing redevelopment PERIOD

Using data from the U.S PERIOD Department of Housing and Urban Development the report finds that  percent of public housing units in the District which correlates to approximately  units need extreme capital improvements PERIOD Last year the D.C PERIOD Housing Authority received  million in federal funding to make these improvements while the estimated cost of the projects totaled . billion PERIOD

According to the report  percent of D.C.s public housing units which correlates to approximately  units have seniors or adults with disabilities as the heads of the households PERIOD On average the occupants of public housing units earn  percent of the median income for the D.C PERIOD metropolitan area PERIOD

Mayor Muriel Bowser allocated upwards of  million of the citys Housing Production Trust Fund to assist in affordable housing projects in the District on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD Bowser stressed the importance of affordable housing in the District in a press conference Jan PERIOD  PERIOD

We all know that housing affordability is one if not the top issue in the District of Columbia Bowser said PERIOD And everything that we do is going to help make more people be able to afford to live in Washington D.C.

Of the  units that will receive funding from the citys housing trust fund  will go to residents in the lowest income bracket which is specified as a family of four living on  or less a year PERIOD Eightythree other units will be used as permanent housing for the homeless PERIOD

Fiscal Policy Institute Housing Policy Associate Claire Zippel the author of the report highlighted the need to redevelop public housing in urban areas to better serve residents PERIOD

Public housing is very unique because it serves probably the lowest income level of any other housing program Zippel said PERIOD Around the country there has been a growing sense since the 1990s that public housing is in bad shape PERIOD It has been underfunded especially in big cities  New York Chicago D.C PERIOD  and the instinct is to redevelop it. the main attempt at redevelopment by the District is the New Communities Initiative which began in  in response to federal budget cuts to D.C PERIOD public housing PERIOD The initiative cites guiding principles such as one for one replacement which aims to ensure no net loss of existing housing mixedincome housing which works to end the concentration of poverty and lowincome housing the opportunity for residents to return or stay in their communities and prioritization of building which calls for the development of new housing to begin prior to the demolition of existing housing units PERIOD

The initiative is only in effect in four neighborhoods of the District Barry Farm in Ward  Northwest One in Ward  Lincoln HeightsRichardson Dwelling in Ward  and Park Morton in Ward  PERIOD

D.C PERIOD Councilmember LaRuby May DWard  who represents an area that includes Barry Farm highlighted the importance of the initiative in monitoring housing and reducing resident displacement PERIOD

New Communities is the vehicle that the District has to be able to look at our local commitment to the preservation of lowincome housing May said PERIOD No one wants to uproot and displace any family PERIOD If possible you want to keep people in their neighborhood in their community with a level of familiarity of where they are. the report also includes recommendations to improve redevelopment including ensuring that residents have access to reliable affordable housing throughout the process increased communication between the redevelopers and unit occupants and a confirmation that occupants have a right to return to redeveloped units PERIOD

Zippel said that though redevelopment is beneficial to the community it must be done according to the guidelines set by both her report and the New Communities Initiative PERIOD

I think that the main point of the report is that if redevelopment is possible if you have the funding to do it it is really important to do it right Zippel said PERIOD Any kind of housing development or redevelopment is really really tricky PERIOD You have to make all the numbers work you have to have all the land you have to have all of your development partners lined up so there is a lot that can go wrong PERIOD It is a very delicate operation that requires a lot of vigilance. research associate at the Urban Institute and sociology professor Mark Treskon said the issues D.C PERIOD public housing faces are not unique to the region PERIOD

D.C PERIOD is facing the same issue that I think that a lot of the big cities are facing Treskon said PERIOD

Across the board those kinds of developments ran into problems PERIOD There was money put forth for building them in the first place but there wasnt really money put forth for upkeep to the same extent. katherine Cole MSB  coordinator of Threads of Hope an organization focused on assisting lowincome communities said that increased access to housing for lowincome individuals could improve many lives PERIOD Cole said she believes that many Georgetown students are unaware of the citys public housing crisis PERIOD

We are kind of in our Georgetown bubble and we dont see the things that are going on and they are there and they are big problems Cole said PERIOD
