After the release of Skyrim by Bethesda in November of  the first expansion for the game was released for XBox  and for PC in August PERIOD Dawnguard introduces a lot of new items such as armor and weapons as well as new areas to explore with twentytwo new quests that include both storyrelated and side quests PERIOD

Dawnguard is a powerful vampire clan Vampire Lords in the game who have obtained an Elder Scroll which contains information on how to blot out the sun for good PERIOD The sun is the vampires main weakness PERIOD However the vampire hunters wish to eradicate the vampires and stop their plans PERIOD As the player you can choose either side of the battle PERIOD

Both sides have interesting quests as well as great perks to help you in battle PERIOD If you choose to be a vampire lord you transform into a sinister looking demonfigure PERIOD When I saw the transformation I thought it looked pretty cool but I was hoping for something more scary and I felt their wings were lacking PERIOD Its really annoying how the sun makes you weaker and if you dont feed on enough blood daily people start to fear and hate you PERIOD This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view PERIOD The vampires in the game have always had a lot of issues like this which makes sense because duh their vampires PERIOD You bite enemies to take their life energy and drain their power PERIOD As you get stronger the more abilities you have such as summoning gargoyles PERIOD

As a Dawnguard vampire hunter you gain new armor and weapons like a crossbow which you can enchant and upgrade like other weapons in the game PERIOD You gain rank and can gain armored trolls to aid in battle temporarily PERIOD

There is a lot of new content in the game not just quests PERIOD The werewolf which was already available has been updated and now has its own skill tree PERIOD So if you loved being a werewolf you can now upgrade and customize the attacks of your werewolf form such as summoning ice wolves to aid you in combat and upgrading your strength to epic proportions PERIOD

There are new creatures in the game like death hounds a mount that you gain in a quest thats an undead skeletal horse and dragon bone weapons PERIOD You have no idea how awesome it is to roll into the nearby town on an undead horse with a sword made from dragon bones while slaughtering everyone PERIOD
This is one of my favorite games to play and now that there has been even more awesome content added such as epic quest lines it only got better PERIOD This expansion is great for anyone who is playing Skyrim already PERIOD I must give this expansion a nine out of ten
