All I have to do is tap my iPhone and seven minutes later my three housemates and I are piling into a strangers black Toyota Camry en route to a dinner reservation in downtown Los Angeles PERIOD The scene may seem strange to the average bystander but with the rise of ridesharing applications like Uber and Lyft in lieu of taxis this occurrence is commonplace for twentysomethings going for a night on the town PERIOD

With low fares friendly drivers and speedy convenient service Uber and Lyft are revolutionizing the college experience for undergraduates in the greater L.A PERIOD area PERIOD

For the average student without a car Los Angeles is lacking in viable public transportation options PERIOD In fact with the price of gas insurance and parking in Los Angeles continuing to rise Uber and Lyft are becoming a more attractive option for Angelenos than the hassle of owning a car PERIOD

Jill Hennessy clinical professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University commented on millennials apprehensive attitudes toward buying cars in an NPR editorial PERIOD

While they do still want to own a car  they are thinking about Do I need a car or not in a way that I think five years ago or  years ago we wouldnt have seen to the same extent Hennessey said PERIOD

Services such as Uber and Lyft have inverted the social scene at Occidental and caused students to be more itinerant PERIOD With the rise of ridesharing services Occidental students can venture out of Eagle Rock and explore what L.A PERIOD has to offer in an affordable way PERIOD

Hadley Sachs senior has been ride sharing as a means to explore Los Angeles nightlife PERIOD

I use Uber whenever Im going somewhere with people and its the type of situation where a designated driver would normally be needed Sachs said PERIOD Uber streamlines the process of ordering a ride and splitting the cost with your friends. the ridesharing movement is not only making private cars a thing of the past but also making taxis obsolete PERIOD Currently riding in an Uber in L.A PERIOD is . times cheaper than riding in a taxi and can also be easily used in conjunction with trains and subways sparking a renewed interest in public transportation in Los Angeles PERIOD

Occidental is tucked into a quiet neighborhood in northeast L.A PERIOD and oncampus housing requirements mean students often become complacent in the campus bubble PERIOD Slowly ride sharing is changing this attitude allowing students to reap the benefits of living in a large city that are sometimes forgotten PERIOD Nick McHugh senior lives off campus and argues that the Occidental social scene is shifting in light of current oncampus restrictions and the rise of ridesharing services PERIOD

Considering the severe lack of relevant oncampus programming and the crack down on offcampus residents Uber is great for students to get off campus and enjoy their college experience McHugh said PERIOD

Long gone are the days where Occidental students had to wait upwards of  minutes for a yellow cab to pick them up at the fountain PERIOD The affordable trips that Uber and Lyft allow are a novelty that simply was not practical for students in L.A PERIOD before ridesharing appeared PERIOD

The benefits are not limited to social life students can now obtain internships in neighborhoods like Silicon Beach in the westside or Hollywood in central L.A. which used to be near impossible to reach without owning a car PERIOD Even Los Angeles International Airport previously an  cab ride away can now be reached for a mere  with Lyft Line PERIOD

With intuitive and userfriendly interfaces it is easy for anyone to link their credit card to Uber or Lyfts applications and be on their way PERIOD And while Uber and Lyft continue in their freemarket battle for dominance in the realm of private transportation ridesharing prices overall will continue to drop PERIOD To the penniless college student this is good news PERIOD

As Uber and Lyft continue to gain popularity in Los Angeles the sight of Occidental students piling into an anonymous sedan will become more and more common PERIOD Ride sharing is not just replacing taxis it is popularizing a social movement allowing young people to actually experience the city PERIOD
