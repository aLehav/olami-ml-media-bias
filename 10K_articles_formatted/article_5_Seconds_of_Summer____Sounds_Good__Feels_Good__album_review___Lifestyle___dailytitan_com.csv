The fourpiece poppunk band  Seconds of Summer from Sydney Australia released its sophomore album Sounds Good Feels Good last Friday PERIOD

With the radiodominated rhythms of electronic dance music EDM and pop artists today such as Justin Bieber and The Weeknd  Seconds of Summer is an outcast band making Sounds Good Feels Good a refreshing new spin PERIOD The album features 90s punk revival sounds like Good Charlotte and All Time Low mixed with segments of orchestral harmonies and interesting sound effects PERIOD

This new album displays a much darker sound for the band compared to their first selftitled album released last June PERIOD Much like the first album Sounds Good Feels Good features peppy upbeat tunes with masterful lyrics but has taken a more mature turn by addressing topics such as poverty heartache and an underlining theme of brokenness PERIOD

The new album opens with Money a catchy track fueled with the spirits of staying young owning the night and living large backed by bright distorted guitars harking back to fellow poppunk band Fall Out Boys smash hit Sugar Were Goin Down. the second track Shes Kinda Hot is fueled by angst and disillusion making it the true anthem song of the New Broken Scene a term coined by the band to start a revolution of outcasts PERIOD A proficient guitar solo in the middle of the track demonstrates their immense talent and musical proficiency PERIOD

The albums third track Hey Everybody is an ampedup alternative version of Hungry Like The Wolf by Duran Duran PERIOD Unlike the  hit Hey Everybody its about the dream of striking it rich and serves as an inspiration for escaping poverty with the lyrics We dont have to live this way. bassist Calum Hood caps off the track with a rich and cool bass lick PERIOD

Jet Black Heart begins with guitarist Michael Clifford belting out about the painful effects of a bad breakup that sets the pace for a transition to a smoother heartfelt sound that rounds out the last half of the album PERIOD Vapor compares the addiction to love to that of vaping PERIOD Songssuch as I Wanna Feel You In My Veins are combined with the sharp contrast of sweet string melodies and heavydriving rhythm of electric guitars PERIOD

With its emotional depth complexity and lyrics that cut straight to the heart Broken Home proves to be the best track off the album PERIOD The song is based on the childhood of the drummer Ashton Irwin and his alcoholic father according to producer John Feldmann in an interview with Fuse PERIOD The lyrics expose the pain felt by Irwin in a broken home life.Dominated by simplicity San Francisco is a shift into a lighter side of the album with acoustic guitars PERIOD Although it is directed towards Californias golden city on the coast the tracks sunshinefilled nostalgia is something anyone can relate to PERIOD

Sounds Good Feels Good rounds out with Outer SpaceCarry On which begins as a plea to restore a lost love and transitions into a message of hope for those struggling with brokenness PERIOD The track boasts a heavenly atmosphere featuring a full choir and an organ PERIOD Lead singer and guitarist Luke Hemmings slices through the instrumentals with a powerful and strong voice PERIOD

Following the new album  Seconds of Summer will go on a Sounds Good Feels Good live tour in  PERIOD After selling out a show during last years twonight stop in Los Angeles the band will return to the Forum on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Tickets are on sale now and can be purchased through the bands website PERIOD
