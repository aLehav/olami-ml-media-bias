7665,1970-01-01,"for the Oregon Club Sports womens soccer team the season ended they way it had wanted and expected  with another W.

Oregon played its final game of the season against Oregon State Saturday on the turf field PERIOD Oregon was generously greeted by the weather and its fans for its final match as it gave the Beavers no mercy en route to a  victory PERIOD

As I like to say We schooled them in the art of soccer head coach Barbie Bowling said PERIOD We were pleased that we won but it was not our best game against Oregon State. throughout the year Oregon has had no trouble winning the rivalry between the two teams PERIOD Of their six meetings Oregon won four tied once and had a close loss PERIOD

OSU is always a physically intense game Bowling said PERIOD We just had more heart than the other team. the Oregon women were very pleased as they ended the season with a  record PERIOD They were able to greatly improve from their fall season when they described themselves as out of shape. oregon was confident that it could beat the Beavers as long as it could beat them to the ball and play with heart PERIOD

Sophomore Cristin Vanderpol and senior Lisa Ryan both stepped up scoring a goal apiece PERIOD Ryan also earned the assist off Vanderpols goalscoring header PERIOD

Oregon will lose seven seniors to graduation this year PERIOD Although the season is officially over as soon as finals are done many of the women will be joining cityleague teams so they can still compete and play together PERIOD

Bowling plans to come back to coach and play again next year but with the loss of many seniors the season will be unpredictable PERIOD

The Oregon women have no worries though as they remain optimistic after this years success PERIOD And after the beating the Beavers took from them this year they may be a little reluctant to see Oregon anytime soon PERIOD
