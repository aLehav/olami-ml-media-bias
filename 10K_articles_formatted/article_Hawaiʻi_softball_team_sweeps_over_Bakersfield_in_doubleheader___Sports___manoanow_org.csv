Three wins is always better PERIOD

The University of Hawaii Whine softball team meant business on Saturday at Rainbow Whine Softball Stadium as they swept their doubleheader over the Cal State Bakersfield Roadrunners  in five innings and  in game two PERIOD The two wins mark four in a row for the Whine PERIOD

Dallas Millwood led the way for the Whine with two runs while eight other Hawaii players had one run apiece PERIOD Millwood also had a teamhigh three RBIs PERIOD

The Lady Bows came out lava hot immediately in the first inning and logged five runs right away in four hits PERIOD Brittnee Rossi was the first to log a run for the Whine thanks to a Nawai Kaupe double PERIOD

The Whine added two more runs in the inning thanks to an Izabella Martinez single which scored Kaupe and Kaena Keliinoi PERIOD Millwood came through with a home run that gave Martinez the goahead run to make it  Hawaii at the end of the first PERIOD

After a scoreless second inning Cienna Curran logged the only run for Bakersfield at the top of the third PERIOD It was an unearned run off a Hawaii error following a Cydney Curran single PERIOD It resulted in the only RBI for Bakersfield all game long PERIOD

At the bottom of the third Hawaii responded with an additional five more runs starting with Maya Nakamura after Millwood got hit by a pitch when the bases were loaded PERIOD A walk from MyaLiah Bethea gave Hawaii their next run via Haley Johnson which turned into a Bethea RBI PERIOD

Coach wanted us to stay relaxed throughout the whole game Rossi said PERIOD

Millwood Bethea and Mikaela GandiaMak added three more runs to make it  Hawaii PERIOD

Bakersfield only got a single from Shaylene Fuimaono in the fourth inning PERIOD After five innings the mercy rule came into play and Hawaii was given the  win PERIOD

Rossi and Kaupe led the way for Hawaii at two runs apiece PERIOD Kaupe also had a gamehigh three RBIs as well PERIOD

I was very comfortable in the box Rossi said PERIOD

Hawaii came out firing again in the second game and logged three runs immediately PERIOD That included two homers from Kaupe and Keliinoi PERIOD Kaupes home run resulted in Rossi scoring as well PERIOD

Bakersfield never got on the board until the third inning PERIOD An uncharacteristic throwing error on Hawaiis behalf with Savanna Montoya at bat turned into a Cieana Curran run PERIOD

Despite Hawaii going scoreless for the next four innings the Whine did an outstanding job preventing Bakersfield from earning any more runs PERIOD They did not score until the bottom of the sixth inning which put some worry in Rossi PERIOD

I dont think it got to us at all Rossi added PERIOD We still wanted to keep putting the pressure on the other team rather than ourselves. in that sixth inning a pair of doubles from Rossi and Kaupe resulted in a Rossi run PERIOD An additional double from Keliinoi resulted in a Kaupe run scored PERIOD Hawaii had a chance at a third run scored via Keliinoi but Johnson and Martinez both received outs PERIOD For Bakersfield more damage was already done as it was now  Hawaii PERIOD

Bakersfield could not log a run in the seventh and that was all she wrote PERIOD

The Whine improved to  in the Big West Conference and  overall thanks to the doubleheader win PERIOD They will head on the road for three games to take on Long Beach State on Friday Apr PERIOD  at  a.m PERIOD HST and in a doubleheader on Saturday Apr PERIOD  at  a.m PERIOD HST and  noon HST PERIOD Neither of these three games will be televised or heard on the radio PERIOD

The three matchups against Long Beach State  will be a battle for second place in the Big West standings PERIOD If the Whine can win at least two games they will be in second place in the standings PERIOD
