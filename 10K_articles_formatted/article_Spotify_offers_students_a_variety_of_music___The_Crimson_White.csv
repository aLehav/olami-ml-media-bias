7945,2021-03-13,"music is slowly evolving over time from records to 8tracks from tapes to CDs PERIOD Now however streaming music is becoming more and more popular with sites like Pandora and iHeart Radio and software like Spotify available at your fingertips PERIOD

Spotify is a European software that was developed in  and launched in the U.S PERIOD in  PERIOD Its a streaming software downloaded to the listeners computer where people can have unlimited availability to millions of songs completely free PERIOD There are paid versions such as Spotify Premium for . a month and with premium the listener can download the Spotify app for iOS and Android for free and have offline access to his or her music PERIOD

Unfortunately for Apples iTunes where the average music album starts at . before tax using Spotify even the premium version is a lot cheaper and gives the listener more access PERIOD

According to StatSpotting.com since its launch Spotify has gained  million users in  different countries with  million being paid subscribers myself included PERIOD Even though iTunes is still the biggest name in digital music with more than  million accounts created according to TechCrunch.com Spotify is catching up to them and slowly taking over PERIOD

Beyond the statistics there are less documented reasons as to why Spotify in my opinon is better than iTunes PERIOD As a member of Spotify Premium I havent bought an album on iTunes since I signed up for Spotify in  PERIOD Frankly its a better value than iTunes PERIOD Why would someone pay . before tax for a single album when they could pay . with NO tax for unlimited access to millions of songs

Additionally Spotify is a better value to college students in the long run PERIOD Students can still listen to their music on their phones and iPods because Spotify has an iOS download including one for older iOS versions as well as for iOS  and not have to pay for individual songs or albums PERIOD

Spotify also has the option to create playlists of songs that can be downloaded for offline listening PERIOD If your phone runs on data plans then you wouldnt have to download the playlists and just listen to them using data PERIOD

One annoying feature of iTunes is that occasionally a little message will pop up saying that you need to verify your credit or debit card PERIOD That annoyed me to no end especially when it didnt work and I had to use my debit card on every transaction PERIOD Spotify Premium deducts the amount I have chosen a month as an automatic deduction so it shows up on my bank statement on a certain day every month PERIOD Hasslefree payments are a blessing PERIOD

What if you dont think Spotify Premium is for you Well Spotify has a 30day free trial where like with most youd only put in your card number for verification PERIOD They will not charge your account at all that month and if you do not like it you can cancel the trial at any time before the end date and theres no charge PERIOD If you choose to keep your subscription which can be cancelled at any time then the first monthly payment will be debited out of your bank account PERIOD

Overall Spotify is a great option for music streaming in my opinion PERIOD Not only is it a relatively cheaper option but it has just as much music as iTunes does without paying every single time you want to have a song on your iPod PERIOD
