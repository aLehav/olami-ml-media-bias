An XX Board of Regents meeting with John Pillsbury the father of the University. by  James NordPublished  September  

The University of Minnesota stood independently for nearly a decade before Minnesota became a state   years later little has changed PERIOD

Thousands of students descend on campus each day many unaware of the tumultuous history and hardfought legal battles that shelter them from academic censorship and political whim PERIOD

They live and study in an immovable stone metropolis  a city within a city  that will exist long after theyre gone PERIOD The decisions of the Board of Regents often impact their lives more than city ordinances or state laws PERIOD

Even though it now gets more than  billion every two years from the state Legislature the University has complete control over its affairs PERIOD It has cut the General College frozen faculty hiring and restructured its Graduate School all without outside approval PERIOD

Its called constitutional autonomy and it puts the University in the unique position to govern itself outside the bounds of state lawmakers in St PERIOD Paul PERIOD

In the past lawmakers have tried to make changes for their own political purposes but history shows its not going to happen PERIOD

Rather than existing under state control in many cases the University is above it PERIOD Established before the state itself the Universitys autonomy is written in the Constitution  written in stone PERIOD

To take control of the University lawmakers would have to go through a process almost impossible to accomplish PERIOD It would call for a controversial constitutional amendment which the people of Minnesota would have to vote into law PERIOD

But no one plans to change it PERIOD The idea of constitutional autonomy is so established that nobody questions it PERIOD

To the regents the autonomy gives control to educationminded experts PERIOD To lawmakers it excludes partisanship from the states premier university PERIOD For students and faculty members it keeps the freedom to research and learn alive PERIOD

Some people have called it the fourth branch of government University constitutional law expert Fred Morrison said PERIOD Its not part of the Legislature its not part of the executive its not part of the judiciary but its established by the constitution. a naughty little issue

Last session state lawmakers included a catch in the money they gave to the University In order to receive a portion of its funds the University would have to meet specific academic standards that were laid out in the bill PERIOD

Some said the state was encroaching on the Universitys territory PERIOD

But they only put  percent of the funds on the line the move was more symbolic than pragmatic and many saw the measure as sending a message PERIOD

Sitting around the broad maple table on the sixth floor of the McNamara Alumni Center many from the typically docile Board of Regents disputed the strings attached funding PERIOD

I think this is an intrusion Regent Patricia Simmons told her colleagues at the meeting PERIOD I have great concerns and I think this is a bad direction. even newlyappointed President Eric Kaler seemed skittish about the idea PERIOD

But in the end the majority of the Regents approved the measure PERIOD Because they control the money Legislators still have leverage to make powerful suggestions that the University usually follows PERIOD

Pick your fights warned Regent Steve Sviggum former Speaker of the Minnesota House PERIOD The risk members is not  percent of our funding PERIOD Thats not the risk PERIOD The risk is our relationship with the Legislature and the citizens of Minnesota into the future. the Regents are not accustomed to being told what to do even if the suggestion means little PERIOD To some the requirement seemed to be the beginning of a slippery slope. its just a naughty little issue between the Legislature and the Board said Regent Dean Johnson PERIOD

But when academic freedom is on the line the University jealously guards its autonomy Morrison said PERIOD

Last session legislators tried to ban state and federal fundingto state programsfor human cloning research  an area University experts say may be a revolutionary next step in fighting disease PERIOD

Before the issue could be tested in the courts Democratic Gov PERIOD Mark Dayton killed the bill and ensured the human cloning language wouldnt make it into the final product PERIOD

Infringements on the Universitys research and education are the most likely to face retribution Board of Regents Chairwoman Linda Cohen said in an interview PERIOD

Academic freedom is so important so frankly that was worrisome when some of the legislators wanted to limit what the research could be on. autonomous History

An early test of the Universitys autonomy came in  and showed what happens when legislators try to dictate academics PERIOD A bill backed by a Christian fundamentalist would have restricted teaching evolution in any publiclyfunded school in the state PERIOD

In response  students gathered at the armory to protest the legislation PERIOD The theme You cannot legislate against thought you cannot legislate against truth. stiff opposition from students the administration and President Lotus Coffman eventually led to the bills demise PERIOD

The University it was decided at last was not to be the University of zealous minorities not the University of political powers not the University of the governor or of the Legislature not even the University of the state itself but quite simply and unalterably the University of the people Historian James Gray wrote in a 100year history of the University PERIOD

That tradition began in  whenthe territorial Legislature createdthe University  before Minnesota had even become a state PERIOD Over the next centuryandahalf the student population bloomed to more than five times the size of the original territory PERIOD

When Minnesota joined the union in  the new state affirmed the rights and constitutional freedoms of the University as an entity older than itself PERIOD Now it is one of at least  state universities to have such protection PERIOD

Historians and law experts point to the constitutional adoption as the reason the Universitys freedom exists today PERIOD

But despite Minnesotans fervor for their landgrant university as financial crises hit and the Civil War raged in the early 1860s the University nearly failed PERIOD

John S PERIOD Pillsbury known as the father of the University is perhaps the single reason the University of Minnesota exists today PERIOD

He helped settle the Universitys many debts and in  secured its first state appropriation for higher education   PERIOD

As years passed the Universitys enrollment skyrocketed and state funding grew to upwards of  million a year PERIOD The system expanded to include four satellite schools and to produce the brunt of research in the state of Minnesota PERIOD

But still the constitutional autonomy question  mostly hovering behind the scenes as an arbiter of academic freedom and respected tradition  has lived on PERIOD

It has been partially defined in a series of court cases over the last century and will continue to be tested into the future PERIOD

A political shield

Lawmakers University officials and lobbyists say that the autonomy is here to stay PERIOD

You dont have to have that discussion every year because people generally know and understand that the University does have autonomy said the Donna Peterson associate vice president of University Relations PERIOD People know about it and they know its there and respect it. despite state aid thats been rolled back to  levels the University continues to work closely with lawmakers on budget and policy measures like those included in last sessions Higher Education bill PERIOD

The  percent funding rider would amount to about . million in withheld aid if the provisions arent met PERIOD The Legislature also originally requested that the University not exceed a tuition increase of  percent and  percent for the next two academic years but Dayton vetoed that version of the bill PERIOD The University has complied with those requests in the past PERIOD

Eighteen percent of the Universitys budget comes from St PERIOD Paul PERIOD Even with plummeting state aid lawmakers and the University work together to craft bills that suit both PERIOD

I view that language as a nudge a pretty direct nudge Chief Financial Officer Richard Pfutzenreuter said of the requested tuition cap PERIOD

Peterson and others in the Universitys Government Relations office worked throughout the session to hone the  percent performance measures to acceptable limits for the University PERIOD They also partnered with Dayton to oppose the human cloning restrictions that were ultimately stricken from the legislation PERIOD

But it would seem that most students take Petersons work and the Universitys constitutional autonomy for granted PERIOD

A group of  students sat in the lobby of Nicholson Hall doing homework and surfing the Internet on a recent morning PERIOD

Not one of them was aware that the University is separate from the state PERIOD Some were surprised at the news while others thought it strange that a law was required to make it so  they thought thats simply how it should be PERIOD

If the students take away one thing from it Morrison the constitutional law expert said it is that the Universitys autonomy to a very substantial extent protects them from having an institution that is simply preaching the political doctrine of whoever is the majority in the Legislature. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
