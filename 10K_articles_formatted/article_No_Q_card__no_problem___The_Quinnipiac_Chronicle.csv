At Quinnipiac you cannot do anything without a Qcard PERIOD You cant eat enter your building your room print from the library or get back onto a shuttle after a long night in New Haven PERIOD

A couple weeks ago I lost my Qcard and it took me six days to get a new one PERIOD Most people would immediately get a replacement as soon as they figured out they had lost it but I waited because I was determined I was going to find my old one PERIOD I also did not have the  to buy a new one PERIOD

I knew the last place I had it was signing in to my workstudy as Boomer the Bobcat PERIOD When I was done I looked frantically but I could not find it PERIOD My first challenge was getting back into my residence hall PERIOD I waited outside for someone to walk out and once inside my roommate was luckily in our room to let me in PERIOD I told him what happened and we made a deal to leave the door ajar until I got a new one PERIOD

Eating was fun PERIOD I became the biggest mooch by asking my friends to pay for my meals PERIOD The upside to my mooching was that I caught up on my meal plan PERIOD My luck continued it was Admitted Students Weekend and I worked as Boomer PERIOD I knew I did not have a Qcard so Boomer walked down the row of tables that were serving food and snagged some free bags with turkey wraps chips and cookies PERIOD I did this for both Admitted Students Days PERIOD Also that weekend Chartwells was giving student workers free meal tickets so I ate for another day PERIOD The only challenge was figuring out how Boomer was going to hold on to it all PERIOD

Spending late nights in the library was fun PERIOD I always entered before midnight so security did not have to ask for my ID PERIOD When I went back to Dana I had to go to security to let me in to the building but not my room  I was still leaving that open PERIOD

Coming back from off campus with friends was a task PERIOD I had to be kicked out of the car before we could go through the security booth at the New Road entrance PERIOD

Six days after I lost my Qcard I finally had the money to buy a new one PERIOD But when I went to the Qcard office both times I tried to attempt transferring money to my QCash account the transaction was marked fraud PERIOD The lady at the Qcard office who watched me struggle after  minutes finally decided to give me one for free PERIOD

At Quinnipiac you are not going to get anywhere without a Qcard unless youre lucky or know the right people PERIOD I survived six days and I dont know how much longer I could have lasted PERIOD
