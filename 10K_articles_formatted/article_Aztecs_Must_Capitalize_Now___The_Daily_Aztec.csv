Meet the District  supervisor candidate Amy Reichert

If you want to be a good college basketball team in an age whereparity reigns supreme you have to be able to win on the road PERIOD

Roadwins more specifically road wins at New Mexico have come few andfar between for San Diego State PERIOD In fact the Aztecs hadnt won inAlbuquerque since  PERIOD So to accomplish what they did Saturday night a doubledigit win at the famed Pit  was something thatshouldnt be taken lightly PERIOD

We all know one win does not make a season PERIOD The win does howevermake for an exciting stretch run as Steve Fishers bunch has a chanceto get right back into the thick of the Mountain West Conferencerace PERIOD

The Red and Blacks   in Mountain West Conferencepostseason hopes are still alive but they must capitalize on whatthey started in New Mexico PERIOD

Coach Fisher said Saturday night that he and his team were goingto savor the moment and that was the right thing to do PERIOD After toughroad losses to Utah and BYU to open conference play SDSU managed toright the ship briefly with a win against Colorado State PERIOD However apair of heartbreaking overtime defeats to Wyoming and UNLV put theAztecs in a deep hole PERIOD

No matter what Fisher said to the media after downing New Mexicowe all know he was already thinking about his next opponent PERIOD Goodthing too PERIOD The Aztecs will have had less than  hours to preparefor Air Force when they travel to Colorado Springs tonight to battlethe Falcons PERIOD

The last time SDSU played on less than two days rest it lost.Granted that loss was to then leagueleading Wyoming PERIOD It was also agame in which the Aztecs led by  and seemed to run out of gas inthe second half PERIOD

If nothing else SDSU can use what it learned against the Cowboysto its advantage tonight PERIOD First of all no matter what the score youhave to play hard PERIOD Parity remember Division I basketball teams aretoo good to throw in the towel just because they fall behind early PERIOD

Secondly the Aztecs will have to play smart PERIOD Air Force  may not have the most gifted athletes in the world butbasketball IQ work ethic and hustle can make up for a lot ofshortcomings PERIOD Every freshman cadet being required to attend all AirForce home games doesnt hurt the homecourt advantage either PERIOD

For all intents and purposes tonights game is of the mustwinvariety for SDSU PERIOD With a victory the Aztecs continue riding the waveof momentum they created with backtoback wins PERIOD They also would havea chance to sweep a twogame road trip  something they havent donesince Jan PERIOD   PERIOD But most importantly a win tonight would helpFishers squad believe it can win on the road PERIOD Not a small thing withroadies to Fort Collins Laramie and Las Vegas looming on thehorizon PERIOD

Winning at Air Force wont be easy PERIOD The Aztecs will have to play40 minutes of sound basketball in an oxygendeficient hostileenvironment and do something they havent done in quite some time PERIOD

Wait they just did that in Albuquerque PERIOD

The Aztecs now know they can win on the road PERIOD Lets just hope theycan prove it again tonight PERIOD If they dont they can kiss theirpostseason chances goodbye PERIOD
