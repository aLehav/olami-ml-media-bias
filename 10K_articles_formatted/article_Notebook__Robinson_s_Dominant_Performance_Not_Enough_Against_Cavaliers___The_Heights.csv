3735,2017-12-31,"in its second conference game of the season on Saturday Boston College mens basketball went neck and neck on the road against another top10 opponentVirginia PERIOD Despite sloppy turnovers and Ky Bowmans ineffectiveness Jerome Robinson stepped up scoring  points and nearly delivering his team its second upset victory of the month PERIOD The Eagles fell one point short of the Cavaliers losing  at John Paul Jones Arena PERIOD

Three Up

 Legitimate ACC Force

While a onepoint loss is always a heartbreaker its easy for fans to be excited by BCs   Atlantic Coast performance in its first two ACC games this year PERIOD Beating No PERIOD  UVA   at home is extremely difficult especially with such a young team PERIOD But considering that the Eagles knocked off thenNo PERIOD  Duke three weeks ago and were one basket away from defeating the Cavaliers its only reasonable to think that the rest of the conference and even the country is starting to recognize head coach Jim Christians team as a legitimate force PERIOD BCs defense looks much improved allowing only  points against a UVA team that was favored by  coming in and poured on  the last time these two met PERIOD

 Jerome Robinson

Saturday afternoon was more about the battle of the Jeromes than anything else in Charlottesville Va PERIOD Ty Jerome and Jerome Robinson recorded  and  points for their respective teams PERIOD BCs Jerome Robinson hit  shots on  percent shooting PERIOD He was the scoring punch that the Eagles needed to keep them in the game PERIOD Time and time again the 6foot5 guard attacked the rim at will PERIOD Because of UVAs packline defense shooting from the outside was less than ideal PERIOD Robinson quickly adapted and made a home for himself in the paint PERIOD He proved that he can carry the team if Ky Bowman who shot  percent from the field on Saturday cant find a rhythm PERIOD

 Defense

BCs defense didnt have much of an answer for Jerome who shot  percent from the floor drilling six 3pointers and dropping a careerhigh  points PERIOD That being said the sophomores success wasnt a byproduct of poor Eagles defense PERIOD Rather he was simply playing lights out PERIOD It looked as if every shot Jerome put up was going in PERIOD The team did do a great job of locking down the rest of UVAs players though limiting the team to just  percent shooting and forcing nine turnovers including eight in the first half alone PERIOD Even without a guy like Teddy Hawkins Nik Popovic Luka Kraljevic and Steffon Mitchell held their own against UVAs Jack Salt and Isaiah Wilkins PERIOD

Three Down

 Turnover Woes Continue

BC recorded doubledigit turnovers for the 10thstraight game coming as no surprise against a stingy Cavaliers defense that ranks first in the country in points allowed per game . and second in the country in opponent field goal percentage . percent PERIOD The turnoverprone Eagles coughed up the ball  times PERIOD Bowman himself gave up possession on five separate occasions in the first half PERIOD Popovic also turned the ball over four times and committed an offensive foul before putting up the final shot of the game all but sealing BCs fate PERIOD While the Eagles took care of the ball better down the stretch recording just four turnovers in the second half their inconsistency and poor ball security has been an issue all year and as of late there have been little to no signs of improvement PERIOD

 Interior Struggles

The Eagles had a tough time battling inside against UVAs frontcourt tandem of Wilkins and Salt who totaled eight offensive boards and six blocks PERIOD Wilkins was particularly spectacular imposing his physicality on both ends of the floor and finishing two points shy of a doubledouble PERIOD When all was said and done he carved out quite an impressive stat line eight points  boards and four rejectionsnone more important than his potential gamesaving block on Bowman with five seconds left on the clock PERIOD Aside from Robinson BC had a difficult time penetrating and often had to settle for deep twopointers and 3pointers PERIOD

 Poor Shooting

Jordan Chatman once again was the only efficient player from deep connecting on four of his five 3point attempts PERIOD The rest of the team shot a mere 3of17 from beyond the arc PERIOD At times Popovic who missed all three of his shots from 3point land was forced to throw up distressed triples late in the shot clock PERIOD UVAs iconic defensive scheme encouraged dribble penetration tempting the Eagles to kick it back outside PERIOD But just when it appeared as if they had an open look on the perimeter a Cavaliers defender would come flying in to contest the shot PERIOD If other players namely Bowman had been more effective from deep the game wouldve been a different story PERIOD
