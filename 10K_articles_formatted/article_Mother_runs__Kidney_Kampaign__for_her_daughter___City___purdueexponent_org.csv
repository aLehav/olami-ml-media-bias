Updated November     pm











Using a Facebook page a sign on her car and a billboard one mother is determined to find a kidney for daughter PERIOD

Lisa Taylor  has been afflicted with renal kidney failure for several years and managed it well until her doctor told her at the end of  that her kidney function levels dropped below  percent and she would need a transplant PERIOD

Taylors mother Linda Butcher has been actively reaching out to people in various ways to find a living donor but she only started several weeks after hearing the news that her daughter needed a kidney transplant PERIOD

My husband was the first person to call the transplant center Taylor said PERIOD

Taylors husband went through the initial testing and he was a match to donate his kidney Taylor said PERIOD But in the final stages of testing the doctors found that there were problems with his lungs PERIOD

Its possible that he couldve gone through the surgery but the doctors didnt want to put one persons life at risk for another Butcher said PERIOD That prevented him from donating. for several weeks we were so hopeful that hed be able to donate. butcher wanted to donate but the doctors told her that her age and previous battle with breast cancer disqualified her from donating PERIOD Other family members were either not a match or had other complications that prevented them from donating she said PERIOD

Since then she started the Facebook page Lisa Taylor Kidney Kampaign . shes put up a billboard on Indiana state Route  east of Lafayette that reads My daughter needs a kidney and Butchers phone number alongside a picture of Taylor and her husband PERIOD The back of her Jeep says the same thing PERIOD

Taylor said the goal is to get a kidney transplant so that she wont have to undergo the process of dialysis which her doctors are now preparing her for PERIOD

According to the National Kidney Foundation dialysis is needed when a persons kidney loses  percent of its function PERIOD A machine removes a persons blood and filters it like a healthy kidney would PERIOD

Dialysis can be an expensive and timeconsuming process PERIOD Taylor who works as a marketing associate representative hopes to avoid dialysis so she wont have to miss work PERIOD

Shes hoping that she can do it at home and that her husband can learn the procedure so she can do it at night and not have to leave work Butcher said PERIOD

Butcher said that since she started the Kidney Kampaign the transplant center has had a lot of people interested in donating their kidney to Taylor but a match has yet to be found PERIOD

One of the reasons is that the evaluation process requires multiple visits bloodwork and other various things such as speaking with a psychologist PERIOD Then theres the time it takes for the donor to recover from the surgery PERIOD

Its a surgery it has its risks but most people come out of it fine Butcher said PERIOD Organ donors have done something wonderful theyve given more years to a persons life and better health. its something very admirable for someone to do. those interested in donating a kidney can call the Indiana University Organ Transplant Center at  PERIOD
