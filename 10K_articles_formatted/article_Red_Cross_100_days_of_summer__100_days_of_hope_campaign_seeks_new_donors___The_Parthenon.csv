The American Red Cross is urging blood and platelet donations to make up for expected shortfall due to Fourth of July holiday travel PERIOD

Blood and platelet donations decline during the summer months especially around holidays like Independence Day. holiday travel causes many donors to be less available to give and many hosting organizations postpone blood drives while people are on vacation PERIOD

According to Red Cross spokesman Josh Hauser during the summer months on average about two fewer donors schedule an appointment to give blood at Red Cross blood drives than what patients need PERIOD This can add up to more than  fewer donations during the summer PERIOD

The Red Cross needs to collect  pints of blood every day to meet the needs of patients at approximately  hospitals and transfusion centers across the country PERIOD

Also about  percent of blood donations are collected at high schools and universities PERIOD When school is out of session the Red Cross tries to double efforts to reach those that would normally come out to donate PERIOD
