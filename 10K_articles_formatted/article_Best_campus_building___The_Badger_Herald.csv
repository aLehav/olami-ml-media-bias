Was there really any doubt While latenight refugees may collapse on stray bean bags or strip the late night caf of every plasticwrapped stale cookie under the florescent light residents of Helen C PERIOD White will eventually grow tired of the fairly nondescript study rooms and trench warfare against their studies and shuffle across the street to Memorial Union the vibrant epicenter of campus PERIOD

Any building that at once can hold meetings on administrative particularities in a myriad of ASM committees while hosting a former First Daughter and the occasional art installation is not just greater than the sum of its parts it is a microcosm of the university as a whole PERIOD

While classes and libraries may be the central nervous system that keeps this university a highlyprimed world class institution it is the union that reflects the pulsating heartbeat of the student body PERIOD Not to mention the capacity for alcohol  thanks Rathskeller PERIOD

But one must not overestimate the ability of the Union to claim this title this is a student union after all PERIOD Without those students who base their operations here  be it those indulging in the cultural arts student government subversive political campaigns or just those looking for respite from the cold  Memorial Union is an odd composite shell of the desires of past students and union members PERIOD

But for now its for the kids PERIOD Rejoice Enjoy your cold beer and local jam bands PERIOD Lay back and wait for the ice to thaw the murky lake to sort of reappear and the Terrace to open up to the sounds of inappropriate conversations and yearly Jazz Blues and SnakeontheLake festivals PERIOD

So enjoy it while it lasts PERIOD Because eventually the everpresent Mrs PERIOD White will be waiting with that history of the Spanish Armada you put on reserve two months ago PERIOD And once you go to grab it shell never let you go PERIOD
