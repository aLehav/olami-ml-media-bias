Andreessen highly recommended three books to the audience PERIOD The first isThe Innovators Dilemmawhich many in Silicon Valley recommend PERIOD The others were more surprisingTechnological Revolutionsby Carlota Perezand Ben HorowitzsThe Hard Thing About Hard Things which just hit the shelves PERIOD

He noted that his relationship with Horowitz is similar to a marriage and provided the analogy of the old couple on a park bench who sit at opposite ends but nonetheless sit together PERIOD He said that they had been working together for so long and that they understand each other and know when to defer to each other and when to trust each other. he added that they argue about everything and constantly argue because they come from different points of view. he acknowledged that Horowitz was a better operator PERIOD

He did answer a question about Carl Icahns attacks about him being on the board of Ebay.He quipped that he thought Ichan would be introducing him today and that the fact that there is activist activity in the tech space indicates that tech is not close to being in a bubble stage PERIOD He said this was especially true for older companies as they generally have very high cash balances and low multiples PERIOD

Andreessen said he spends most of his Mondays in partner meetings and that its a very good sign for entrepreneurs to be invited to the Monday meeting.He also said that its best for startups to pitch early in the day rather than late and that the partners will typically meet with  startups each Monday.He said A16Z is run very methodically and that they have a pipeline report and run the deal process through a salesforce pipeline PERIOD He added that A16Z comprehensively tracks companies in their portfolio and companies they are sourcing PERIOD

He said he hated copycat startups and startups that are variations of successful startups.He noted the flappybird clones and the snapchats for dogs PERIOD

Andreessen finished the talk by answering two questions PERIOD The first question was around journalism and he noted that his interest in journalism was less from an investment point of view as A16Z doesnt really invest in content and media production.But he thinks news journalism is very important and believes that newer entrants to the field will be able to make the business sustainable again.He noted that another reason he cares about journalism is because he is an avid reader PERIOD

The second question he answered was what areas of the tech industry he found exciting PERIOD He said there were three areas with great potential healthcare education and financial services PERIOD He noted that early on the plan for A16Z was to do no rocketships no space elevators no drugs and no biotech and healthcare. it is interesting to note that all three of those spaces are heavily regulated PERIOD

Throughout the discussion Andreessen displayed a deep appreciation for history.He cited tech pioneers such as Thomas Watson David Packard Ross Perot and Tom Perkins.He quickly captured the zeitgeist of the late 1990s during the tech bubble PERIOD He also provided a broad overview of journalisms history PERIOD

Andreessen was interviewed by Andre De Haes an MBA2 at the Business School and who will be a venture capitalist working at Index Ventures after graduating in June PERIOD Hes included inour list of Stanford students who are VCs PERIOD
