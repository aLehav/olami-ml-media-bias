Being a fan of the Indian cricket team is like being a Boston Red Sox fan  times a billion PERIOD The pain and cruelty that comes from being an Indian supporter can only be felt by one of us PERIOD

Cricket has a special place in the hearts of most Indians PERIOD By far the most popular sport in the region cricket is followed religiously by the majority of the billion plus people PERIOD

For far too long the Indian cricket team has been reliant on the greatness of one or two superstars PERIOD

Whether it is Kapil Dev Sunil Gavaskar or Sachin Tendulkar India has always been a oneman show PERIOD While India has done well in developing and nourishing such great talent they have done little toward putting together a winning team PERIOD

But that all changed about four years ago when thennewly appointed captain Sourav Ganguly teamed up with coach John Wright PERIOD With veteran players retiring and fresh blood replacing them India became a formidable team under Gangulys leadership PERIOD

Elusive Test match wins in the West Indies England and Australia were followed by Indias first overseas victory in over a decade against Pakistan PERIOD

The team spirit was epitomized by Indias impressive run in the  World Cup when Indias only losses came against the Australians  who have been untouchable since  PERIOD

In just four years Ganguly has secured his place as Indias most successful captain ever PERIOD Being an Indian fan was finally worth all the suffering PERIOD

Then suddenly something went awry PERIOD Maybe it was the threemonth break from international cricket or just the law of averages kicking in but the Indian team started losing more and winning less PERIOD

What was more worrying was the loss of team spirit PERIOD The fire in the bellies of most of the players was put out PERIOD The team didnt seem interested in winning anymore PERIOD

This was symbolized recently in the latest match against Pakistan after which Ganguly was banned for six matches due to tardiness on the field PERIOD

While some players have batted their way out of this problem like Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid most of the team is still hurting PERIOD While Ganguly has been singled out for his poor run with the bat other veterans like Tendulkar VVS Laxman Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif have not performed their best PERIOD

While this is worrying news for Indian supporters it is not something to lose sleep over PERIOD

In  Ganguly and Wright built a resilient team PERIOD They picked players seeing how they would fit in a good team PERIOD The players responded by playing their part PERIOD

Currently that is the problem  they are not performing in their roles PERIOD The Indians need to rediscover the winning formula not by making major structural changes but by minor tweaking of the current system PERIOD

For starters they still need to find and stick to a successful opening partnership PERIOD But more importantly the Indians need to get their confidence back PERIOD The simplest and most common way of doing this is to practice harder and play more matches PERIOD

But the Indians should also concentrate on improving something that is usually taken for granted  their fielding PERIOD

Fielding is a crucial part of cricket and to some extent is the one part of the game that players can really use to turn any game around PERIOD

Tight fielding not only restricts the run flow but also adds pressure on the batting team PERIOD

The fielding of a side is reflective of their passion to win PERIOD On a day when nothing else is going right the players really only have their fielding to win a match PERIOD It isnt a coincidence that the Australians are such great fielders PERIOD

Regardless of this though Ganguly and Wright have formed a solid foundation for future generations to build on PERIOD With Sehwag and Dravid reaching their peaks and several promising young players like Mahendra Dhoni and Irfan Pathan India seems to be in good condition PERIOD Something tells me that Gangulys right when he says that India is only a couple of wins away from glory PERIOD
