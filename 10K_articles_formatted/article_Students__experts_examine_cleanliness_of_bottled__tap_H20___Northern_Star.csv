When it comes to safe drinking water Joseph Zozzaro chooses bottled water over tap PERIOD

The senior kinesiology major said he has yet to see a contaminated water bottle PERIOD Many of the water fountains offered on campus not only look rusted but taste rusty he said PERIOD

Its a little sad seeing people drink from these Zozzaro said PERIOD God knows how much rust theyre going to be getting. however NIUs tap water is regularly tested by DeKalb and any rusty taste is usually the result of stagnant water in building pipes said Melissa Lenczewski associate professor in geology and environmental geosciences PERIOD

Lenczewski spoke with members of the Green Paws Environmental Alliance about the issue and plans to advise them on how other campuses like the University of Vermont successfully reduced water bottle use said Sarah Wawerski the clubs president PERIOD

The club decided during a meeting Wednesday to circulate a petition set up a committee and encourage students to bring their own canteens in order to reduce water bottle use PERIOD

The water distributed at NIU comes from DeKalb Chief Assistant Engineer Kevin Howard said PERIOD The plants on campus draw water samples monthly and submit them to DeKalb Water Resources a division of the DeKalb Public Works department for microbiological analysis PERIOD A report on the levels of various contaminants in the water is submitted yearly as well PERIOD Bottled water suppliers are not required to provide such reports Howard said in an email PERIOD

Where did the water come from Howard said PERIOD Was it bottled in DeKalb Was it bottled in this country The bottled you are drinking may contain toxins PERIOD How do you know

The water in DeKalb goes through ion exchange softening and iron removal in five treatment plants to ensure safety said Bryan Faivre assistant director of public works PERIOD The softening process reduces water contaminants like calcium magnesium and radium PERIOD

DeKalb Water Resources runs tests on iron fluoride phosphate chlorine and bacteria weekly he said PERIOD Radium samples may be taken quarterly or every three years depending on how frequently radium is detected at a treatment plant PERIOD Radium levels have not exceeded the EPA limit of five picocuries per liter in the past decade Faivre said PERIOD
