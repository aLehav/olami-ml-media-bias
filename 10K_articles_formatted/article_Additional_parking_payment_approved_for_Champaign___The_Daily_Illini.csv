No I think it will be an advantage if we get something that works Schweighart said PERIOD The last time we did it we did not have a great deal of success for them but I think it will be an advantage over the parking meter and easier to use. other council members are not so sure PERIOD

There is currently a paystation there PERIOD However council member Tom Bruno said the paystation never worked correctly and was at times totally inoperative PERIOD

Council member Deb Feinen said that many patrons may not even know how to pay their fees PERIOD

However Mayor Schweighart is optimistic PERIOD

Well its a learning experience but its an advantage over not having a bunch of change and using and being able to use dollar bills or credit cards in them Schweighart said PERIOD

Public Works officials sid the stations machines will have to undergo specific performance requirements and will work this time PERIOD

The paystation machine at Lot J will be installed shortly PERIOD If youre planning to eat on Green Street in the near future be sure to bring extra change or your credit card PERIOD",Additional parking payment approved for Champaign - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
