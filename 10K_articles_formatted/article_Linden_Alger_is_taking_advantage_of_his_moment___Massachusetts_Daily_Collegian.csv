With under  seconds left and with a  lead the Massachusetts hockey team was ready to coast to a victory over Union on Friday PERIOD The Dutchmen  took their foot off the gas expecting the No PERIOD  Minutemen  to hold onto the puck and wind the clock down PERIOD

Linden Alger wasnt done playing though PERIOD

The junior defenseman was firing shots all night long trying to generate offense either for himself or others PERIOD And just before the final horn sounded Alger wound up and fired the puck past Unions goaltender PERIOD The bench immediately erupted PERIOD

Thats awesome for him the whole team was pumped sophomore Taylor Makar said PERIOD Im sure theres more to come for him. the goal was meaningless to the final outcome it changed a  win into a  game on the final stat sheet PERIOD But it was meaningful to him personally and to the team as a whole PERIOD Alger is one of UMass favorite teammates PERIOD

Linden Alger is probably the most liked guy on the team Carvel said PERIOD Hes the glue hes that guy that everybody just really enjoys PERIOD For two years he hasnt played much so when he scores everybody gets excited. ahead of his third year Alger carved out a role in the backend after two seasons of hardly seeing any game action PERIOD He plays alongside freshman Noah Ellis on the Minutemens third defensive pairing PERIOD Carvel sees a lot of potential in the group but with such little game experience Alger and Ellis have been slow to make an impact PERIOD

Carvel challenged Alger in the offseason PERIOD The landscape of the UMass defense was unclear outside of the top four and with so many new faces entering the program there was room for Alger to claim a consistent spot in the depth chart PERIOD In terms of the number of years under Carvel Alger and Aaron Bohlinger are the Minutemens two most experienced defensemen PERIOD

Now that Alger is playing in games hes getting more and more comfortable by the minute PERIOD He knows his role is to be a scary defender that plays with his body and thats exactly what he set out to do this season PERIOD

I challenged him to be a big strong kid Carvel said PERIOD I said you should have a attitude on the ice. and of course you have to have more than an attitude you have to be able to execute and move the puck. the first four games of the season showed some ups and downs in Algers game the defenseman mishandled the puck a few times early on leading to turnovers PERIOD But once the nerves settled he quickly became a sounder smarter defender PERIOD His breakouts of the defensive zone have been quicker and his shot taking from the blue line provides more offense for an already potent UMass attack PERIOD

His game has evolved here pretty quicky Carvel said PERIOD I wasnt happy with his first couple games but hes starting to be the hockey player that we think he can be and hopefully he keeps continuing with that. as Alger gets more experience and more comfortability his role in the backend is growing more and more secure PERIOD Carvel is never shy to play around with lines when he feels a shakeup is necessary but for now hes turning the reigns of the bottom pairing over to Alger and Ellis PERIOD

I think he can grow into being him and Noah Ellis a good  with that size Carvel said of Alger PERIOD Hes got a long way to go and so does Ellis but its exciting because they can be better. no matter how little of an affect it had on Fridays game every single Minuteman was excited to see Alger leading the skate down the bench for his first career goal PERIOD From seniors that have seen Alger since the moment he stepped on campus to freshmen who just met him over the summer the appreciation UMass hockey has for the junior is clear PERIOD

Everybody loves Alger freshman forward Kenny Connors said PERIOD Hes one of the best guys on the team hes a really nice guy PERIOD I didnt even know it was his first but it was a really good shot. colin McCarthy can be reached at emailprotected and followed on Twitter colinmccarthDC PERIOD
