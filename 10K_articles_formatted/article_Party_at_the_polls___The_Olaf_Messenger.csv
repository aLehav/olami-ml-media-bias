8957,2012-11-01,"as the election approaches and the polls continue to fluctuate many St PERIOD Olaf students prepare to vote for the first time on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD The St PERIOD Olaf Political Awareness Committee PAC  along with partyspecific student organizations on campus  encourages students to actively and intelligently participate in the election PERIOD

With a mission to provide the student body with an unbiased source for political information PAC has put on a variety of events to increase the level of the political conversation at St PERIOD Olaf PERIOD

In regard to the election PAC has prompted us to put on events like Candidate Town Hall an opportunity for undecided voters or anyone that wanted to come and ask questions about the positions of each of the four most prominent candidates PAC Coordinator Kevin George  said PERIOD

Additionally PAC brought in political speakers such as Zach Wahls and Bob Woodward  both wellattended events  but most importantly worked to register as many students to vote as possible PERIOD

Easily the most important thing weve done so far is our drive to register students to vote George said PERIOD It is a fundamental goal of our organization. pAC successfully preregistered between  students and in combination with the efforts of Students for Barack Obama STObama students are wellinformed about the formalities of the voting process PERIOD

So many students wanted to register to vote on campus or had questions about how they could request an absentee ballot from their home state STObama Volunteer Coordinator Olivia Slack  said PERIOD Voting is your civic duty as American PERIOD Our democratic system as we know it today wouldnt function without people participating in the political process by voting. for firsttime voter Ben SwensonKlatt  excitement about voting extends beyond civic duty PERIOD

To me voting in this election is more than just believing in a political party SwensonKlatt said PERIOD Basic human rights are being voted for which I think shouldnt even be an issue in the first place PERIOD I have friends that will be affected if certain amendments pass PERIOD I believe very strongly in equality for everyone  the chance to love someone or the ability to vote so Im trying to do everything I can to stop them. with so much buzz about the election coming at students from different directions PAC remains one of the few organizations  on or off campus  that transmits political information without an agenda PERIOD

We dont exist to convince you how you should feel about a specific policy or candidate we exist only to give you the best information possible for you to make your own decision about which is an invaluable resource said George PERIOD

Zach Westermeyer  appreciates PACs unbiased approach noting that the media does not always present the truth about politics especially around election time PERIOD

All the partisanship prevents the government working for the good of the people like it was created to do and instead turns into a giant campaign to make the other side look worse Westermeyer said PERIOD On the bright side election season is a reminder of the fact that we live under a free democratic government PERIOD Educated voting is important because you are exercising your right to an opinion from your perspective on who should lead this country. although election season can be a long tiring process the excitement on campus about the election remains evident PERIOD

I do think students are excited to vote this year said George PERIOD There has been a lot of energy on campus the past few months and I expect that to carry through to Election Day next week PERIOD We have a fairly politically aware campus and students do show interest as they are involved in a wide variety of political causes and organizations. cronstolaf.edu
