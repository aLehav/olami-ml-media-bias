With Valentines Day quickly approaching comes the stress of finding the perfect gift for that special someone and a WSU music fraternity is offering serenades that Cougs can purchase for their significant others PERIOD

Junior music education major Tommy Hill the president of Phi Mu Alpha said he believes there is no better way to raise money for the fraternity than by sharing what they love to do PERIOD

Our main service our main philanthropy is singing Hill said PERIOD We thought what would be a better way to make money for the fraternity than by spreading music the best way we can for Valentines Day

The main piece Phi Mu Alpha will offer is titled A Serenade to a Girl which was written specifically for different chapters of Phi Mu Alpha to perform across the country PERIOD

Its such an awesome piece Hill said PERIOD And halfway through we all get down on one knee and present her with a flower. hill said he believes this is a great opportunity for the Pullman community because of how unique the experience is for both the person who purchases it and the person who receives it PERIOD

Its special that Phi Mu Alpha offers this kind of event because it creates a memory that people wont forget Hill said PERIOD

The fundraiser also provides the brothers of Phi Mu Alpha an opportunity to get their name out there PERIOD Hill explained they are always welcoming new members and the only requirement is an appreciation for music PERIOD

Being in Phi Mu Alpha is unlike anything else I could imagine Hill said PERIOD Unlike other fraternities we dont just have the frat in common we also all have singing and music in common PERIOD I think that is what sets us apart from other Greek organizations. the brothers of Phi Mu Alpha will be tabling in the CUB every day this week from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD Oncampus serenades with a single rose cost  offcampus serenades with a single rose cost  and serenades with a full bouquet on or off campus cost  PERIOD

Its such a great gift Hill said PERIOD If I was dating someone right now Id totally hire these guys for a serenade. community
