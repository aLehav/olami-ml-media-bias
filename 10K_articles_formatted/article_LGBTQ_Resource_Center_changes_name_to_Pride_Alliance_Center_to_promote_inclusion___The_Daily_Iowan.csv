Rylee Wilson News Reporter February  

The UI LGBTQ Resource Center has renamed itself the Pride Alliance Center in order to be more inclusive of diverse sexual and gender identities as well as to clarify the purpose of the center PERIOD

Alex Bare the outreach director of Spectrum UI a LGBTQ student organization on campus said the LGBTQ abbreviation is not fully inclusive of all sexualities and gender identities PERIOD

There is constantly a need to edit and amend the abbreviation that is used to describe a very diverse community Bare said PERIOD Because there is an everevolving concept of identity and we dont know how long were going to be using LGBTQ perhaps its better if we use an allencompassing term like pride. pride Alliance Center Director Emma Welch said the center would also frequently receive calls confusing the Pride Alliance Center with the UI LGBTQ clinic PERIOD

The Pride Alliance Center located at  Grand Ave PERIOD Court opened in  PERIOD

We wanted to increase the clarity of the purpose of the space for the resource center Welch said PERIOD We had for instance a lot of folks calling in who were confusing us with the LGBTQ clinic on campus which can be problematic for several reasons PERIOD Although we would never share information from callers who phoned in were not a confidential entity. rELATED UI earns  out of  stars for LGBTQ friendliness

Tabitha Wiggins the assistant director of Multicultural  International Programs said the conversation to change the name began with students who frequently use the Pride Alliance Center PERIOD

There is constantly a need to edit and amend the abbreviation that is used to describe a very diverse community PERIOD

I would come into the space and say What do you think about the name and ask students who use the space Wiggins said PERIOD Our student staff were getting a lot of phone calls PERIOD There were a couple incidents in which the center was targeted for some harassing behavior PERIOD That was one of the first thing that prompted the conversation about the name PERIOD We didnt understand how folks could see our center as other than what it is and it came back to the name being potentially problematic. welch and Wiggins said that many other universities are moving away from the LGBTQ abbreviation for their resource centers PERIOD The University of Northern Iowa recently changed its LGBT Center to Gender and Sexuality Services PERIOD Wiggins said most other Big Ten universities have made similar name changes as well PERIOD

Colin Lakadat the UI Student Government constituency senator for LGBTQ said the name change is a positive change PERIOD

The LGBTQ community is one that is constantly evolving and changing throughout time Lakadat said in an email to The Daily Iowan PERIOD In order to keep up to speed with the changing times and to be as inclusive as possible removing the abbreviation LGBTQ but allowing the queer context to remain is a good way for the center to evolve yet keep its purpose whole. rELATEDStudents find home away from home thanks to UI cultural center coordinators

Welch said the name change has sparked positive reception from members of the UI LGBTQ community PERIOD

I think its pretty cool we have already been getting emails from students and staff and faculty who are excited about the name change Welch said PERIOD They have said that they feel more included in the new name and so thats been awesome to know that we are serving campus in the way that they want to be served. read Next
