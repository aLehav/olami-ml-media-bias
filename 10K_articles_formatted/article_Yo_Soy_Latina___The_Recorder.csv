We waited awhile to receive copies of the script from Powell said junior social work student Demesis Negron PERIOD We had to specifically email Powell to obtain rights for the show PERIOD She was very nice about lending the rights to us and wants to see a taping of our performance PERIOD This is the first time she is letting students and the university take charge of her show PERIOD She usually supplies other campuses with her choice of her actresses and directors. the show starts with an urban poet who sets the tone for the beginning of the show PERIOD The show consist of six main characters and touches upon important topics such as female empowerment barriers family stereotypes and men PERIOD

The show is verywell balanced said Brown there are parts that make you laugh and then there are parts that are really emotional and hit home PERIOD It really makes you think. brown and Negron casted the show during the fall semester and have been having rehearsal every week since January PERIOD

Negron said we really hope for a good turn out and support for the ladies who put in a lot of hard work to make this possible PERIOD Several years ago CCSU performed this show and I think we recent events happening its time for CCSU to see once again what Latinas are about PERIOD Its a really strong piece that I feel like everyone will enjoy. having worked with the Womens Center before when they sponsored her domesticviolence piece Is That Love Brown hopes she can make all the staff and students at the Womens Center proud PERIOD
