October is a time for falling leaves and carving pumpkins and for millions around the world it is a time for beer drinking PERIOD Right here in McMinnville it is possible to satisfy your thirst with unique and traditional brews PERIOD

The present season for brews started in Munich Germany with the first Oktoberfest in  held in celebration of the marriage of a Bavarian prince PERIOD Today the festival is  days long usually ending in the first week of October and features German food music and strong dark beers PERIOD

Unknown to many there are traditional German beers brewing in the heart of Yamhill County PERIOD

Were living right in the middle of one of the most creative microbrewing areas in the world Mark Vickery brewmaster at Golden Valley Brewery said PERIOD

Vickery knows what hes talking about PERIOD Hes been brewing for  years and is the man behind the beer at GVB a local favorite PERIOD

Vickerys current seasonal brews are the Oktoberfest a German style lager with a smooth velvety taste and the Tanenbaum a strong ale he calls a winter warmer PERIOD

It has big malty notes balancing the hop characters he said PERIOD And with eightpercent alcohol its the most bang for your buck. another local expert is Rick Allen brewer and owner of Heater Allen Brewing PERIOD Allen started his oneman operation about two years ago and went from brewing on a 20gallon system to a 200gallon system PERIOD

After honing his homebrewing hobby for more than  years and working in the wine industry Allen began to sell his brews PERIOD

I decided to open up a brewery and run it like a small winery he said PERIOD It makes life interesting. and that is what he has done here in McMinnville PERIOD Allen sells directly to customers whether it be to individuals who buy by the bottle or case or local restaurants such as La Rambla Restaurant and Bar Nicks Italian Caf and Bistro Maison that buy by the keg PERIOD

He makes only a few different brews at a time all of which are lagers PERIOD Lagers are made from malt and hops as opposed to ales which are made from yeast and hops Allen said PERIOD

His current seasonal brew is Bobtoberfest a smooth crisp beer named after his late brother who inspired his interest in brewing PERIOD

I try to base my seasonal brews off of traditional German beers Allen said PERIOD

Unlike other Oregon brewers Allen imports all his grains from Germany and other areas of Europe PERIOD He is constantly trying out different flavors PERIOD

I kind of have a good palette for the flavors he said PERIOD I can munch on the grains and taste what it will be like. though GVB and Heater Allen are the only brewers in McMinnville there are plenty of microbreweries close by PERIOD Festivals showcasing these brewers include the coming Holiday Ale Festival in Portland Dec PERIOD  at Pioneer Court House Square and the Oregon Brews and BBQs Festival held in McMinnville June  PERIOD

Take advantage of being in this area while youre young Vickery said PERIOD And get to know good brews. there are plenty of opportunities to please your taste buds nearby so grab your pint and start sipping PERIOD
