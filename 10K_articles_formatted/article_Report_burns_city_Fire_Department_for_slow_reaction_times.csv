5357,2011-02-10,"a report from the Palo Alto Fire Fighters union released Feb PERIOD  revealed that the citys Fire Department responds to emergencies efficiently on a general basis but suffers from certain deficiencies PERIOD

The Fire Services Utilization and Resources Study report said the Fire Department has become a stagnant organization and management is struggling due in part to insufficient support staff. although the overall assessment of the Palo Alto Fire Department was positive TriData Division the consultants with whom the union worked to publish the report listed  recommendations for improvement PERIOD Areas of concern included the training and development of officers the need to merge two fire stations and combining some fire administrative functions wrote assistant city manager Pamela Antil in an email to The Daily PERIOD

The 190page study also said the lapse between dispatch time and turnout timehow long it takes for equipment to be ready for use at the emergency sitewas too long PERIOD

Palo Alto Professional Firefighters Union president Tony Spitaleri is confident that recommendations on resource sharing could be put into effect immediately but he said improving reaction times would require additional studies and observations of their impact on Palo Alto neighborhoods PERIOD

We have a minimum requirement of people on duty we want to look if that has an impact on how resources are deployed Spitaleri said PERIOD This is an issue that needs a lot of discussion PERIOD When you start reducing staffing level the number of folks who respond to emergencies or when you start reducing physicians you put firefighters and citizens in jeopardy. in addition Spitaleri emphasized the importance of improving dispatch a problem area that will be crucial for serving the rising number of emergencies PERIOD The report shows medical calls increased by nearly  percent since  PERIOD

There needs to be more flexibility in analyzing and disarming more type of units in an emergency Spitaleri said PERIOD We dont have a system in place that allows us to do this on a consistent basis PERIOD Were looking at investing money into this process. he added that the city is working to fill more positions in the upper management level of the Fire Department PERIOD

Fire marshal positions were not filled which has caused the deterioration of our programs to move forward Spitaleri said PERIOD The workload fell on the shoulders of a handful of people. were not as efficient as we could be he said PERIOD

But Antil insists that feedback from the city council firefighters and public were positive about resolving these issues PERIOD He noted that many of the recommended changes could be made without affecting the citys existing union agreement PERIOD

These will be a launching point of continued dialogue between the firefighters and city administration Antil said PERIOD
