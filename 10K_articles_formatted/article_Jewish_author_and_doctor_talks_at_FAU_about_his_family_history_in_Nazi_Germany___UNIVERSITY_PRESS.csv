Bernd Wollschlaeger remembers the day in  when the newspaper headline read Jews killed in Germany again after the Munich massacre PERIOD Most of the people in the audience shook their heads in remorse probably for a second time because they were alive when it first happened PERIOD

The Jewish author and physician told his story at FAU on the Boca campus this past Sunday Feb PERIOD  as part of the Raddock Family Eminent Scholar Chair on Holocaust Studies Lecture series PERIOD Wollschaleger spoke about his book A German Life and his journey to find the truth about his fathers involvement in Nazi Germany as a military officer PERIOD

Despite the fact that his lecture caught the interest of those who could qualify for Dennys daily  percent off meal for senior citizens there was one student in sight at the event PERIOD

Most students were likely partying for the glorious game on Super Bowl Sunday but junior Toni Strzelewic attended Wollschlaegers lecture to gain extra credit for her Hitler in Nazi Germany class PERIOD

I actually enjoyed the lecture the English and history double major said PERIOD I learned a lot and its part of my past because Im also Jewish it helps connect. the one hour lecture followed by a short QA session and book signing told the story of how Wollschlaeger found out out what Nazi Germany was really like during World War II which was different from his fathers version of the story PERIOD Wollschaleger eventually cut ties with his family and after seven years of dedication to the Jewish faith he converted from Catholicism to Judaism and became an Israeli citizen PERIOD

Even though not many young people were there Wollschlaeger had a message for them anyway PERIOD

Ask questions dont necessarily follow what people do he said PERIOD Understand when hatred and animosity toward anyone begins not only if they are Jews or Muslims but towards anybody that acts different looks different or speaks a different language PERIOD Look how to develop tolerance. wollschlaegers story is presented as part of the Holocaust Studies Lecture series but he hopes its not always seen as that PERIOD

I hope my story is timeless and not attached to a certain generation but that it has a message that will be able to address anybody any age any gender. florida Atlantic Universitys first studentrun news source PERIOD
