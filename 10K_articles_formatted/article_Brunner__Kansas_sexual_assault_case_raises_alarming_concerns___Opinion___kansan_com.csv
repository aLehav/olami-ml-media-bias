Columnist Grace Brunner argues the world needs to stop victimblaming as a Kansas judge recently gave a 64yearold predator reduced sentencing based off the claim that his teenage victims were the  in the case PERIOD











Conversations surrounding sexual misconduct and the role of victimblaming within allegations have become commonplace in recent years PERIOD Amidst the MeToo movement claims of sexual assault and abuse have been abundant as individuals have come forward to share their stories PERIOD And yet the courts have repeatedly failed to prosecute these cases with the lack of legal action remaining a notable point of conversation since the publicized case of Brock Turner who received only a sixmonth sentencing for his rape conviction PERIOD

Recently this trend has struck closer to home as a Kansas sexual abuse case has made national headlines PERIOD Leavenworth county Judge Michael Gibbens ruled to lessen the sentence of 64yearold Raymond Soden from  years to only five years in prison for his felony charge of electronic solicitation involving two young girls ages  and  PERIOD

In defense of lessening Sodens sentence Gibbens claimed the two young girls were partially at fault discrediting their own status as victims and labeling them as aggressors PERIOD according to CNN PERIOD However Soden is legally of age to consent to sexual behavior while neither of the young girls who have been labeled as the aggressors are able to do so PERIOD Additionally Soden admitted to police he was aware of the girls ages and he was aware his actions were wrong PERIOD The argument against Soden also included two prior convictions of battery and sexual battery PERIOD

Child advocacy and abuse prevention groups have rejected this ruling PERIOD Julie Donelon president and CEO of the Metropolitan Organization to Counter Sexual Assault said in an interview with CNN that  and  year olds cannot be aggressors PERIOD Children do not have the capacity to consent. moreover Donelon claims that as a society we understand it is never the victims fault. however societys understanding of this fact is not entirely cut and dry PERIOD The tendency to place blame upon the victim has become a fartoo common trend in cases involving sexual assault and abuse PERIOD Is it not uncommon to hear questions of what the victim was wearing as reasoning to discredit their sexual abuse or violation allegations PERIOD

This past fall a case in Ireland sparked international outrage as a 17yearold girls underwear was presented as evidence in a courtroom to counter her claims of rape PERIOD According to data provided by the Rape Abuse  Incest National Network on average only  of every  sexual assault cases are reported to police PERIOD Furthermore of these mere  reported rape cases only  rapists will be arrested and only less than five will be incarcerated PERIOD

Gibbens sentencing was based in Kansas sentencing guidelines that permit a lesser sentencing if the victim was an aggressor or participant in the crime PERIOD And while labeling a minor an aggressor seems an extreme fault on the judge It still remains clear that more must be done to protect victims of sexual misconduct particularly youth PERIOD

This case brings a glaring attention to the lack of value our society places in the word and wellbeing of victims PERIOD Society is fostering an atmosphere that questions and neglects victims and this attitude has seeped into our courtrooms building a legal system that condemns victims PERIOD
