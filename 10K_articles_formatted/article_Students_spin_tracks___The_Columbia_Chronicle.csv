There is a notion that all it takes to be considered a DJ is a laptop computer and a futuristic sounding name PERIOD Not so says the Columbia College DJ Collective PERIOD

Originality in deejaying right now is a dying art said Paul Evangelista a sophomore majoring in audio arts and acoustics who serves as president of the collective PERIOD

The collective established in spring  aims to educate aspiring DJs on the tradition and fundamentals of deejaying in addition to helping DJs find gigs PERIOD

The three things were focusing on are networking education and performance Evangelista said PERIOD

The club holds twohour bimonthly DJ workshops for Columbia students Tuesdays at the  E PERIOD Congress Parkway Building that go over basic and advanced techniques for all levels of deejaying including information such as where to buy DJ equipment PERIOD

Its a great workshopsaid junior audio engineering major Nick Stoynoff who serves as the groups vice president. its an opportunity to learn how to spin PERIOD Theres a serious lack of education out therepeople think being a DJ is playing a bunch of songs. a Wednesday lunchtime DJ series has been hosted by the collective at the Hokin Annex in the Wabash Campus Building  S PERIOD Wabash Ave. since the groups establishment PERIOD Three DJs each play a 40minute set which could include musical stylings ranging from hiphop to electronica PERIOD Within electronica various substyles include housewhich originated in Chicago drum and bass electronic techno and trance music Stoynoff and Evangelista said PERIOD

It creates more of an atmosphere Evangelista said PERIOD Weve had nothing but positive feedback. because of advances in technology and the widespread use of new software programs that provide features to automatically match beats and replay looped segments of music everyone and their grandma today is a DJ Stoynoff said PERIOD

The collective intends to help cultivate the skills and knowledge working with vinyl and CDs endeavoring DJ needs in order to be successful in Chicago PERIOD

We educate students on formats Evengelista said PERIOD We can show them technique but they really have to know their music PERIOD The DJ market in Chicago is very competitive. nevertheless many DJs continue to use traditional DJ setups of a deck mixer and an amplifier to play music PERIOD

Theres so much talent here said Sean Kelly  treasurer for the collective who is in his first year majoring in arts entertainment and media management PERIOD The infrastructure here supports it PERIOD You can go and see some awesome DJ shows. when playing a club or party the bottom line is playing the right song at the right time Stoynoff said PERIOD What separates the pro from the amateur is reading the crowd. though patrons take note Most DJs do not like requests Stoynoff said as a requested song may not fit the mood and ambiance a DJ is trying to create PERIOD Youve got to make a journey tell a story when you play PERIOD You have to work the crowd. some  members are currently active with the collective which is an officially recognized student organization PERIOD

We have a lot of organizations with a lot of different interests said Aldo Guzman director of Student Engagement PERIOD We look for organizations that bring value to the college experience. being involved with a club is an extension beyond merely attending classes at school Guzman said PERIOD It helps students develop an entire college experience while theyre here become really involved with campus find out whats going on and develop a lot of different skills. while the popularity of using various mechanics to remix already recorded music has many wondering if such a genre is merely furor its a necessary evolution of the age we live in said Alex Grimes junior music composition major PERIOD Music doesnt just come out of nowhere its a tradition. the collective will showcase DJs at this years Manifest on May  PERIOD
