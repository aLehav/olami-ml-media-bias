Dear Editor

Once again we the students of this fine institution are being taken advantage of PERIOD  The perpetrator this time  The department of parking services PERIOD  This should really come as no surprise to us as we are taken advantage of yearly by the fact that we have to pay  per yearor is it  Im not sure I just have my accountants pay for it all. just to park our cars on campus PERIOD  Now they are telling us that the stadium lot will be closed on Thursday just because of the football game  Ludicrous PERIOD  I am a huge football fan a member of the MUSS and will be screaming my guts out on Thursday night PERIOD  But why does the lot have to be closed all day  I directed an email to the office and received the reply of at least we let you know in advance PERIOD  Gee thanks PERIOD  That solves all of the problems PERIOD  Laura Healey from the office of parking services solutions were take traxx or arrive early PERIOD  Great answers but unfortunately for a majority of students not acceptable ones PERIOD  Last time I checked traxx did not make stops at Riverside Elementary Mrs PERIOD Myndis PreSchool or Nana and Papas house each morning PERIOD  The second solution is just as unacceptable PERIOD  Anyone who commutes to campus already knows that you have to arrive early to get a spot to park PERIOD  If you arrive after  the stadium is already packed full and you have to park at the Veterans Hospital lot I paid for a U permit not an E permit PERIOD  Why this dilemma  Because parking services continues to oversell parking permits on a yearly basis PERIOD  Why  Because they are money hungry mongers who like to take advantage of students PERIOD  Maybe Ms PERIOD Healey would like to give up her spot no doubt she has a reserved one she works for the chosen dept. for a day  HA HA PERIOD  I would encourage all students to flood the department of parking services with phone calls  and emails emailprotectedand let them know how inconvenienced we have been PERIOD  Finally I estimate that I probably park in the stadium lot about  days per year PERIOD  This comes out to about . per day PERIOD  I asked Ms PERIOD Healy from the dept PERIOD of parking services where I can pick up my dollar refund PERIOD  I have yet to hear back from her PERIOD  GO UTES
