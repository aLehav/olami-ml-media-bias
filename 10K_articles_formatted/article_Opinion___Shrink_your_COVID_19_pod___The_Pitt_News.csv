Pitt urged all students both on and off campus to stay home until further notice rather than travel back to campus for the spring semester in a Jan PERIOD  email PERIOD Since virus cases are soaring across the country once again Pitt will instead notify students two weeks before they are permitted to move in PERIOD

Some offcampus students already have travel plans and will probably keep them PERIOD Others might just want to get out of their parents house PERIOD Which is all to say even with residence halls remaining closed some students will return to campus PERIOD Its also pretty safe to say that a majority of campus transmission happens in public spaces offcampus rather than within University housing  there was only one reported residence hall outbreak located in Tower B PERIOD Pitts case numbers also started to soar following Halloween weekend likely related to students attending parties PERIOD

I wrote in August about the importance of talking frankly with roommates about social distancing and ensuring that fellow pod members were being responsible and limiting their exposure PERIOD Allegheny County reported  confirmed cases of COVID19 on Aug PERIOD  the day the column was published PERIOD Now the county is reporting hundreds of cases a day and hospitalizations are nearing an alltime high. united States COVID19 cases are also at an alltime high and with a new more contagious variant scientists are warning that the situation will become even worse in the coming months PERIOD Whether youre returning to campus now or staying put for the time being you should think seriously about shrinking your COVID19 pod PERIOD

I think most of us got away with something risky last semester  having a 10person Friendsgiving celebration sleeping with a Tinder date attending a party or just relaxing social distancing practices in general  by not communicating well with our established pod PERIOD Theres just not space to do this anymore PERIOD If someone did a few risky things last semester and didnt get sick that doesnt mean the risk was OK or that theyre out of the woods PERIOD It essentially means that they were lucky PERIOD

Compared to other public state universities this past fall Pitt fared fairly well in terms of case numbers PERIOD The University has reported more than  student cases whereas Penn State for example reported more than  PERIOD I would argue though that the case numbers here were likely substantially higher than what Pitt reported since aside from randomized surveillance testing Pitt only tested individuals who were symptomatic or in contact with someone who was confirmed positive PERIOD Students also had access to offcampus testing sites like CVS and other popup clinics in the Pittsburgh area and those case numbers are only included in Pitts COVID19 reports if the student chooses to report the case to the University PERIOD

While its true that Pitts lower numbers can partially be attributed to students taking caution its also likely that they were lower because Pitt unlike other universities didnt start the semester with inperson classes and the county transmission rate was relatively low when students returned to campus in August PERIOD As noted earlier cases started to accelerate when Pitt began allowing inperson classes and right after Halloween PERIOD Around this time community cases were beginning to accelerate too PERIOD

We never really saw if Pitts mitigation efforts were effective after the postHalloween spike because students went home for break shortly after PERIOD But this is all to say when COVID19 is present in the community it spreads like wildfire PERIOD And since then the prevalence of the virus in Allegheny County has only increased PERIOD If you choose to return to campus you are at a far greater risk of coming into contact with someone who is infected and thus becoming infected PERIOD

Talking to pod members about their COVID19 activities  who exactly theyre seeing how often they go shopping whether or not they go to the gym  can sometimes feel like interrogation but this is necessary PERIOD It might seem safe to hang out with someone who hangs with only three other people but its likely those three people are each seeing three other people and so on and so forth PERIOD You should assume that every time someone in your pod is exposed to another person you are also exposed to that other person PERIOD So if you are in prolonged close contact without a mask with someone outside your pod you should behave as if youre then in contact with everyone theyve been in contact with PERIOD With the county reporting several hundred cases a day the chances of infection seeping into your pod becomes drastically higher per each person you add PERIOD

Perhaps even more than maskwearing and handwashing proper social distancing is really the most effective way to slow the spread of COVID19 PERIOD And really there is no good way around it PERIOD

Some people choose to engage in risky behavior and then get tested for COVID19 and while this is definitely better than nothing it isnt foolproof PERIOD If someone gets a test too soon after exposure the virus might not be detectable in their body yet and they might get a false negative PERIOD Most experts recommend waiting at least two days postexposure before being tested  and by then youll almost certainly be in the presence of your pod members PERIOD And even if you do wait the recommended period of time test results are still subjective PERIOD There are a slew of COVID19 tests currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration and each has a different accuracy rate which depends on different factors PERIOD The FDA recently warned Los Angeles a COVID19 hotspot that a particular test residents use might not be producing accurate results PERIOD

You should only be in a pod with people whom you are absolutely certain are behaving responsibly PERIOD Lay out what you see as responsible behavior PERIOD Have a conversation with your friends PERIOD If someone isnt willing to take precautions in a way that makes you comfortable shrink your pod PERIOD And no matter how responsible your pod members are theres always a chance of exposure PERIOD The fewer contacts you have the better PERIOD

With vaccinations beginning in the United States and a new more competent president being sworn into office there is light at the end of the tunnel PERIOD But weve still got a long way to go before well see any sort of normalcy PERIOD We have to keep each other safe until then no matter how hard it is PERIOD Were out of options at this point PERIOD
