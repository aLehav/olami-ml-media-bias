7835,2015-05-19,"and if only for a little while we could insist on the impossible. could I begin my final column for this newspaper in a more melodramatic fashion The idea of the college experience is something Ive thought about way too often as a commuter for my first three years on campus I often thought about the random excursions and bonding moments living with my fellow classmates I might be missing out on PERIOD Movies have taught me that college is a time to do one of a few things yell Toga and act like a party animal freak out when people ask you vague questions about your future incessantly talk about this one time at band camp PERIOD

All stereotypes aside college is a time where even in your supposed naivete you can try to insist on the impossible as Frank Turner suggests in his song Love Ire  Song. ive written in the past in this space about media and its effect on memories and how difficult it is to relax and enjoy a memorable moment while youre having one  Ive also written about what it can mean to you when you reach the end of different things in your life PERIOD In writing this column I am going through all these things to a great extent one of the songs most on my mind right now  Dark Bird Is Home by the Tallest Man On Earth  is one from an album that I reviewed in this same issue youre reading PERIOD The song goes the journey of a man struggling with the end of something  interpretations have been posed as a relationship ending or a dying man giving comfort but in the way that great music does it allows you to impose your own feelings whether they be joy sadness or that inexplicable combination of the two that is so prevalent in the ending chapters of our lives PERIOD

In looking at my time in college I can roughly divide different segments  rather different feelings of experience into different songs artists and films PERIOD Jack Johnson was playing on my first date in a future relationship PERIOD Florence and the Machines Shake It Out was popular as I transitioned from high school to college PERIOD As I drove home late nights after production at the Highlander I listened to the radio and heard many tales on Loveline and was introduced to the band NO who would become one of my favorites PERIOD Late nights at the Highlander were also filled with the inevitable allure of saxophone and George Michael and Careless Whisper along with Bonnie Tylers Total Eclipse of the Heart being played for no particular reason other than it was early morning and our tired brains liked cheesy 80s songs PERIOD I saw the terrible Robocop remake at a midnight at one of our schools free premieres and I went to my freshman orientation the morning after seeing the last Harry Potter at midnight PERIOD The point in mentioning all these specificities  of which there are dozens more I could mention  is that whether we realize it or not our experiences are intrinsically linked to the things happening around us PERIOD

Whether or not you have the typical college experience isnt the point  whatever happens to you personally and how you grow from said experience is what matters PERIOD Having songs or other media to help you along the way is one of our many ways of coping and learning about how to be human PERIOD Sharing these experiences with friends and using media as a medium for nostalgia reflection and learning is one of the beautiful parts of life PERIOD Theres a saying that asks whether art imitates life or viceversa  in this case its both PERIOD Media has the power to deeply move us and help us understand parts of life that are beyond are our grasp  the late great Roger Ebert called movies an empathy machine. i dont think its too far of a reach to extend that description to songs and other forms of media PERIOD Personally learning how to criticize media has also allowed me to explore ideas of what media means to me and why it means certain things to me

All of these associations combined with the potent collegiate combination of freedom and few responsibilities allow us a plethora of new avenues to go down without having to commit to anything for too long PERIOD Media along with our friends of course serves as an apt companion and teacher  and memory maker PERIOD Have fun PERIOD Watch movies PERIOD Listen to songs PERIOD Play video games PERIOD Feel empowered feel sad feel that unexplainable combination of the two PERIOD Dont be afraid to push boundaries PERIOD Find your passion feel ambivalent about it change it go back to it  it does not matter how you get there so long as you find that passion you want PERIOD As Turner says in another song I Knew Prufrock Before He Got Famous Life is about love last minutes and lost evenings about fire in our bellies and furtive little feelings. remember this time fondly PERIOD Dont be afraid to try new things  whether thats in college or in life PERIOD

Dont be afraid to get away from the sprawl PERIOD Ill see you out there PERIOD
