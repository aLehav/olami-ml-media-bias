By  Rasmieyh AbdelnabiAugust  

As video streamed in the images showed the once bustling city of New Orleans as an underwater ghost town with cars floating atop riverlike water heights and houses halfway underwater PERIOD

When it made landfall the 165mph winds lost a bit of their gust PERIOD As a Category  storm with 145mph winds however it still wrought destruction upon the abandoned city PERIOD

Palm trees were stripped of their fronds unboarded windows were blown out and people sought shelter on top of their homes PERIOD The roof of the makeshift emergency shelter the Superdome was peeling back and leaking as  people looked on PERIOD

Television anchors brave enough to venture outdoors found themselves dodging street signs and other debris sometimes standing hipdeep in fast waters PERIOD

The storm was eventually downgraded to a Category  but not before flooding areas such as Biloxi Miss PERIOD and Mobile Ala. which saw more than two feet of flooding PERIOD

The eye of Hurricane Katrina passed over New Orleans and was headed toward Biloxi and Mobile said geography professor David Changnon PERIOD

Areas on the right side of the hurricanes eye suffered the most damage he said PERIOD

Those cities along with the east coast of Mississippi will feel the brunt of the storm Changnon said PERIOD

As of press time the storm leveled off to a Category  PERIOD

It was still too early to gauge how much damage the hurricane and the ensuing floods caused PERIOD However its effect on the oil market is already observable PERIOD

We should expect at least a 10cent hike in gas prices over the next week or two if not more NIU meteorologist Gilbert Sebenste said PERIOD

New Orleans is home to one of the nations most active sea ports PERIOD

Seventypercent of the United States oil resources are imported and close to  percent of the imported oil comes through the Port of New Orleans PERIOD So roughly  percent of this oil has been disturbed Sebenste said PERIOD

The oil rigs and platforms are located along the southeastern Texas coast the Louisiana coastline and off the shore of Louisiana and Mississippi PERIOD

They are designed to sustain severe hurricanes but with 35foot waves crashing into the oil rigs and platform there are few preventative measures to be taken Sebenste said PERIOD

The rigs in Texas are safe but the rigs in Louisiana are sitting ducks he said PERIOD

Before the storm a barrel of oil was roughly  Sebenste said and the oil market closed at . pERIOD At one point it soared more than  setting a record at . pERIOD

As for DeKalb gasoline prices rose slightly to an area average of . pERIOD

Katrina may be one of the worst hurricanes to hit the United States Sebenste said PERIOD

In  Hurricane Andrew made its way along the coast of Florida causing horrific damage  its highest winds reaching  mph PERIOD

A Category  hurricane hit Biloxi in  while Hurricane Camille caused massive devastation just east of New Orleans and along the coast of Mississippi PERIOD

Hurricane Camille was slightly more devastating than Katrina because Camille hit land with wind speeds of  mph while Katrina landed at  mph PERIOD

As Katrina moved farther from the  degree ocean waters the storm lost a bit of its ferocity PERIOD

A hurricane feeds off warm ocean water but as it reaches land the hurricane gets weaker PERIOD The strength of a hurricane is measured by a five level system called the SaffirSimpson scale of strength PERIOD A Category  hurricane is the most severe PERIOD

Names of hurricanes are chosen by an international committee and alternate between female and male names PERIOD The committee recycles names of lessdamaging hurricanes and retires names of strong ones such as Camille and Andrew PERIOD
