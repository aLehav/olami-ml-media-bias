By Elizabeth Sayasane Features Editor October  

Every year the Office of Undergraduate Admissions takes responsibility for recruiting admitting and enrolling new students at the University PERIOD As Director of Undergraduate Admissions Andy Borst helps to oversee these operations PERIOD

Around this time every year those working at the admissions office are traveling throughout the world PERIOD They go to high schools and speak with counselors and meet with students PERIOD They also direct campus visits both the large operations as well as daily tours for prospective students PERIOD

With the pandemic halting life as usual admissions operations had to reconfigure itself quickly PERIOD

Throughout a typical year well host about  people to campus who are prospective students and their families Borst said PERIOD In order to ensure the health and safety of our currently enrolled students we have discouraged students from visiting campus. the office has scheduled more than  opportunities for students and their families to engage with representatives from the University virtually PERIOD A focus of the office has been ensuring that communication between the school and students has been smooth as possible PERIOD



Even with these dramatic changes being made though Borst said the transition went smoothly PERIOD This in part has been thanks to the frequent COVID testing available on campus PERIOD

This has also made answering questions from counselors students and parents about how campus is coping easier PERIOD

Its been a really great I think positive image of the University with showing how well we planned for this event Borst said PERIOD It is nice to be able to communicate to students and parents and counselors that we feel like were doing better than everybody else in the nation with doing the regular testing and with the Safer Illinois app. he knows one of the biggest concerns for students particularly high school juniors at the moment is ACT and SAT testing PERIOD The University is moving to testoptional for the academic year which has led to some additional anxiety for students PERIOD

Those who do not want to send scores have concerns about what they will be reviewed on for the admissions process PERIOD Those who do want to send scores are concerned that the pandemic will affect their performance on the test PERIOD

I think that we do have a good process in place of how were going to do our review PERIOD Weve done wholistic review for a long time at Illinois so I think that were pretty good at this Borst said PERIOD

Nonetheless he hopes to help ease these anxieties for students PERIOD Borst said they should not be concerned too much about their scores because Were not going to penalize a student for something that is truly beyond their control. the pandemic has taken away so much of the students control and the University will not hold them accountable for that in the admissions process PERIOD

Borst said that he really hopes to communicate to these students that everyone is there alongside them trying to maneuver the difficulties that go with working from home PERIOD

Borst said many students ask exactly how they will be reviewed and judged but stressed that there is no special formula for admissions PERIOD Applying for college is already a stressful time for many high school students PERIOD During the time of COVID19 students carry the additional stress of uncertainty PERIOD

Were right there building the plane with you as it takes off into the air he said PERIOD Were figuring this out as we go so were going to do our best to put the most fair process in place for this fall. looking to the future and how admissions overall will be impacted by the pandemic Borst said is like trying to look into a very murky crystal ball PERIOD Their typical projection models are based on known data PERIOD Nothing about the current situation with the pandemic is known PERIOD

The varied questions of helping students has really tested our limits for staffing he said PERIOD

The department has struggled to answer questions from all different kinds of students PERIOD One question could have several different answers depending on if that student is a resident of Illinois comes from another state throughout the country or is an international student PERIOD

I anticipate challenges in bringing in next years class however I feel optimistic that well be able to hit the numbers that campus expects he said PERIOD
