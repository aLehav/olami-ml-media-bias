My Opinion

Senior Staff Column

Do something outrageous kids PERIOD

Something really really flippin outrageous Live life in the way you always dreamed you would PERIOD

My freshman year at Penn State I had the chance to not only hear the inspirational feminist Gloria Steinem deliver a speech at Eisenhower Auditorium I had the chance to meet her PERIOD In fact I was actually quoted in the Collegians article on the event yes there was life before the Collegian PERIOD

And now for the purposes of this column I have the chance to steal and modify her quotes in order to share her wisdom with you PERIOD

To this day her words of advice for everyday activism play over and over again in my head challenging me to do greater things and become a better person PERIOD

But before your eyes glaze over and you start thinking that this is just another  prima donna rant  just simmer down and listen PERIOD Because feminist or not Gloria has got it right PERIOD

Every single day of this awesome thing we call life is meant to be outrageous and extraordinary PERIOD

And I truly believe that we are meant to make the most of it  not only for ourselves but also in the process for others PERIOD

But first let us start with ourselves PERIOD

As I find myself facing graduation in two weeks Im wondering how I thought life would turn out once I  a.k.a PERIOD graduated from college PERIOD

While somewhere in third grade my plans of being an animator for the Animaniacs series were dashed due to the fact I discovered I couldnt draw worth a shit PERIOD But no worries folks I have soldiered on PERIOD

Now I can look forward to a long and promising career in journalism and womens studies PERIOD

But the truth is I simply dont know where Ill end up or what Ill end up doing PERIOD

And after  straight years of education which were supposed to give us all the answers right not having all the answers is kind of a scary thought PERIOD You know what Im saying

But one thing Ive learned in the last four years is that part of living a life of outrageous acts is to live life without fear PERIOD

Carrying around a fear of the unknown is such a downer PERIOD It prevents you from taking the chances necessary to challenge yourself and allow yourself to grow and to learn more about who you are PERIOD

My advice to achieve this extraordinary life Do anything that scares you PERIOD Personally Ive done a lot of this within the past year PERIOD

First I recommend moving halfway around the world PERIOD The farther the better PERIOD I lived within a few miles of the Indian Ocean in Perth Australia last spring while I studied abroad PERIOD

I was more than  hours away from home by air travel PERIOD Theres nothing like two oceans between you and home to help you figure out who you are and what you want PERIOD

Second I recommend throwing yourself out of a plane PERIOD But with a chute of course PERIOD Before reaching Australia I had a chance to go traveling PERIOD I went backpacking for five weeks in New Zealand with a Penn State gal who I now count among my good friends PERIOD

Around week four after three previous attempts to jump out of a plane they were canceled due to inclement weather I found myself free falling from  feet over the most gorgeous country in the world PERIOD

Third try something completely different PERIOD Get involved in Penn State in as many different obscure organizations and activities as you are interested in  even if you have no clue what they are or whether or not you can do it PERIOD

My one big regret from my time at Penn State was not hanging out with the spelunking club PERIOD

Fourth get out of your cultural element PERIOD Penn State may not be the most diverse campus in the country but we have a wealth of student organizations that put on fantastic cultural events PERIOD As a student groups reporter last semester I had a chance to cover the Indian Graduate Students Organizations event OMKAR  PERIOD

All I have to say is  So dont be afraid to learn about and participate in the celebrations and events of other cultures PERIOD Thats why these students put on these events PERIOD They want you to go PERIOD

Fifth tell that one person how you really feel PERIOD This is tough PERIOD No doubt about it PERIOD But at the very least youll have the satisfaction of knowing you were honest PERIOD

Life is so cool PERIOD Just know if you live life as a series of outrageous acts as Gloria suggests youre guaranteed to have a good time and a good conscience PERIOD Make a difference in your own life and youre bound to make differences in the lives of others PERIOD

Good luck all PERIOD And thank you for making my time at Penn State some of the greatest moments of my life  so far PERIOD
