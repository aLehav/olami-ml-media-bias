4165,2004-04-07,"the  mens lacrosse team conformed to expectations by going  this past weekend at the Oosterbaan Field House in Ann Arbor Mich PERIOD

The Gauchos however surprised almost everyone with how they faired at the Fifth Annual Michigan Invitational PERIOD The tournament began as expected with a convincing  over MinnesotaDuluth on Friday as Santa Barbara cruised to what amounted to a warmup win PERIOD

Saturdays game against  Michigan would be the polar opposite PERIOD The lowerranked Wolverines were heavy underdogs in the game despite playing in their own facility PERIOD In front of a loud home crowd Michigan played tenaciously frustrating UCSBs highpowered offense with a zone defense the Gauchos had never seen before PERIOD Santa Barbara was outshot and uncharacteristically lost in the battle for ground balls but still managed to keep the game close PERIOD Michigan pulled away in the third though when they sneaked a goal past junior goalie Ryan Brittain who finished with  saves PERIOD Despite several fourth quarter Gaucho shots that hit the post Michigan pulled off the  upset PERIOD It was the Gauchos lowest scoring output since playing Division III Whittier College in  PERIOD

We didnt know what to think PERIOD Half of us were angry half of us thought it might have been a good thing sophomore midfielder Nick Schooler said PERIOD That loss got us in the right mindset to face Colorado State. head Coach Mike Allan got the Gauchos on the right track by immediately switching things up against the  National Champion Rams PERIOD Santa Barbara had last seen CSU when the two played in St PERIOD Louis at the USLIA finals PERIOD Allan installed UCSBs version of the zone defense in the hopes of slowing the  Rams down PERIOD

They CSU watched us play Michigan PERIOD They figured we were going to be a cake walk Schooler said PERIOD

The previous night CSU beat the Wolverines  PERIOD

Santa Barbara started the game by jumping out to a  lead PERIOD The Rams answered right back eventually making the score  at the end of the first PERIOD Throughout the game neither team led by more than two goals with much of the scoring seesawing back and forth PERIOD

It was intense PERIOD There was definitely some bad blood between us and CSU sophomore attacker Lewis Kubitz said PERIOD CSUs frustration only mounted in the face of Allans zone defense as the Rams constantly turned over the ball PERIOD

Despite that CSU seemed like they had momentum going into the final quarter after ending the third by taking a  lead PERIOD With two goals by Schooler and senior attacker Hank Caulkins however the Gauchos quickly took the lead PERIOD Santa Barbara finished off the  fourth quarter and the Rams with goals by junior midfielders Will Patton and Stefan Isaksen to take a huge  win over the defending national champions PERIOD

Though it wasnt his statistically best game Brittain who finished with eight saves played solidly in the face of a powerful CSU offense PERIOD In a reverse of the game against Michigan the Gauchos outshot the Rams and outhustled them to every ground ball PERIOD Patton won  of  faceoffs with many turning into offensive opportunities PERIOD

Coach Allan told us before the game that we could sulk or we could put the loss against Michigan in our back pockets to motivate us and we listened to him senior midfielder Scott Holmes said PERIOD
