MVP by Position

QB Cam Newton290 yards  PaTD  It was just the second game of his short career without a rushing touchdown but he made up for it by throwing for three scores PERIOD Newton took advantage of a Vikings defense that was without a couple of important cornerbacks and he also ran for more than  yards though with two fumbles PERIOD As usual his main target was veteran wide receiver Steve Smith who is continuing to have an extraordinary year PERIOD

RB Steven Jackson191 yards  TD  Jackson has fought injuries and inconsistency all season so it was nice to see him explode against the Saints this week PERIOD SJax hadnt had more than  fantasy points in a single game yet this year but he topped  even with A.J PERIOD Feeley as his starting quarterback PERIOD I would try to trade Jackson this week if you can sucker someone in your league to give up a great player in exchange  theres no way he has another game like this in him PERIOD

WR Calvin Johnson125 yards TD  In a week that didnt see a single wide receiver score more than  fantasy points the MVP award goes to the guy who just doesnt stop producing PERIOD Megatron nabbed his eleventh touchdown catch after only eight games a feat that has only been produced once before by Randy Moss and he remains a force to be reckoned with from both reallife and fantasy perspectives PERIOD

TE Brent Celek94 yards TD  This was a blast from the past as Celek used to be among the fantasy elite at the thin tight end position PERIOD Quarterback Michael Vick targeted him nine times for seven catches and the receiving distribution in Philadelphia deserves to be monitored from here on out PERIOD If Celek can become one of Vicks goto guys he will once again return to fantasy prominence PERIOD

DefenseSpecial TeamsDetroit Lions   Sacks INT  Fumbles Recovered  TD  points allowed  They befuddled Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow all afternoon giving up only a field goal before a touchdown late in the game PERIOD Tebow turnovers accounted for both of the defensive touchdowns as the Lions are now the topscoring fantasy defense in the league PERIOD

Last Fridays Predictions

I struck fantasy gold by putting the hobbled Matthew Stafford  yards  PaTD in the ThumbsUp section PERIOD Unfortunately the other recommendations produced very mediocre days led by Chris Johnsons stinker against the Colts PERIOD I would hate to advise making a rash decision like cutting CJ entirely but its gotten to the point where you probably have better options on your team every single week PERIOD Until he shows some of his old flash stash him on your bench PERIOD Better yet try to trade him to someone who will pay for his name value alone PERIOD

LeSean McCoy ruined the ThumbsDown section from last week by obliterating the previously firstranked Dallas Cowboys run defense on Monday night PERIOD The Cowboys helped stifle another one of my picks as they held McCoys teammate DeSean Jackson to only  yards PERIOD

Waiver Wire Pickups

Chris Ogbonnaya RB Cleveland Browns  With Peyton Hillis ruled out it was expected that Montario Hardesty would follow up his 33carry game in week seven with another heavy workload in week eight PERIOD But when Hardesty injured his hamstring after just two rushes for six yards Ogbonnaya became fantasy relevant PERIOD I dont know much about his talent but Cleveland has showed that they like to take the ball out of Colt McCoys hands and give it to their running back PERIOD The situation is as good as it can be for Ogbonnaya now lets see if he can capitalize PERIOD

Eric Decker WR Denver Broncos  Tebow seemingly iced Decker out in his first two games but this week Decker caught six balls on  targets for  yards and a score PERIOD The two players came into the NFL in the same draft class and I expect heavy doses of both Decker and Demaryius Thomas if Tebow continues to start for Denver PERIOD

Victor Cruz WR New York Giants  Hakeem Nicks cant seem to stay healthy so Cruz should be a startable fantasy receiver from here on out even if Nicks is active PERIOD Cruz finished week eight with  yards and the gamewinning score which was good enough to be the fourthbest fantasy receiving performance of the week PERIOD He now has at least  yards in four of his last five games with four touchdowns over that span PERIOD Definitely add him if hes available in your league PERIOD
