I want to create an atmosphere and environment where students feel connected to the college and cared for said Joshua Pinaula student body president and SGA chair

Brendan Dorsey Staff WriterDecember  

Joshua Pinaula didnt think he would ever be student body president let alone serve two terms PERIOD

I never looked at myself as a politician I really dont still PERIOD I dont do a lot of things politicians like to do Pinaula said PERIOD

Students elected Pinaula  as student body president in  and reelected him last spring PERIOD Over his yearandahalf tenure hes ushered in some large changes PERIOD

Pinaula has had an unusual college experience PERIOD He enrolled at SRJC in  after graduating high school PERIOD Although he started in SRJCs theater program Pinaula treated the college like a commuter campus and was not very involved PERIOD

While most students breeze through SRJC in a couple of years Pinaula didnt have that luxury PERIOD Within his first semester physicians diagnosed Pinaula with lymphoma PERIOD He dropped out of school and started a chemotherapy regimen PERIOD

Pinaula dismissed his battle with cancer PERIOD I wasnt scared PERIOD I knew I was going to get out of it he said PERIOD

After his yearanda half bout with lymphoma Pinaula decided to pursue work instead of going back to school PERIOD He worked for three years first at My Friend Joes the campus coffee shop many SRJC students frequent PERIOD After a stint as manager there Pinaula took a job on the assembly line at General Hydroponics PERIOD

Pinaula worked the graveyard shift at General Hydroponics PERIOD I would spend eight to  hours a day locked in my head doing repetitive actions forever and ever and after months of doing this I felt myself getting dumber. this unfulfilling experience on the assembly line led to an important revelation in Pinaulas life PERIOD

I would rather be poor and go back to college than do anything else he said PERIOD

Once back at SRJC that epiphany also triggered a strong desire to get involved on campus PERIOD Pinaula joined the Atheist and Skeptics Club and eventually became president PERIOD

When I first came back I really wanted to do something PERIOD I really wanted to solve problems he said PERIOD

Pinaula identified the lack of club activity on campus as a problem he could fix PERIOD He wanted to foster an environment where students wanted to be more active in campus life and clubs were the best way to do that PERIOD Although Pinaula jokes  percent of the reason he got involved was for the free food PERIOD

Clubs are where my heart is PERIOD It almost epitomizes student life in my mind involved students doing the things they care about. pinaula became chair of the InterClub Council serving from  to  PERIOD That year he helped the number of clubs on campus grow from  at the beginning of his term to  by the end PERIOD SRJC still boasts a whopping  clubs a high for most California community colleges PERIOD

Pinaula assumed the role of student president in May  PERIOD

Some of his biggest and probably most longlasting accomplishments will be the foundational structures he created for the Student Government Assembly which he chairs PERIOD

I think its really important to focus on your foundational issues PERIOD Thats why I got the constitution changed and the bylaws created Pinaula said PERIOD

Last spring Pinaula simplified the SGA constitution making it easier for students to amend PERIOD He created bylaws that offer more flexibility in the way the SGA operates PERIOD

The SGA chair insists one of his biggest goals is to make it easier for great people to get involved. he executed this vision with the implementation of the Student Center Fee which effectively doubled the SGAs budget PERIOD This allowed the SGA to hold large events create a bike repair station in Petaluma and hire another advisor to advance student issues PERIOD

Josh is an excellent leader PERIOD Everything he does begins with How will this benefit the students said Vice President of Student Life Virginia Kerr PERIOD

Pinaula wants to build upon this foundation even more by transforming Pioneer Hall which is currently occupied by Disability Resources into a dedicated student center PERIOD It would be a place where students from different clubs and communities could congregate PERIOD He envisions the center would provide office space meeting rooms and a student resource center PERIOD

I want to create an atmosphere and environment where students feel connected to the college and cared for he said PERIOD

Student participation on campus seems to have dramatically increased under Pinaulas administration PERIOD Ninety percent of the student seats are filled on districtwide committees reportedly an all time high PERIOD The number of clubs70 on the Santa Rosa campus and  on the Petaluma campusare greater than ever before PERIOD

He is also moving forward with plans to restore the fountain in the center of campus as well as make the student finance code more intuitive PERIOD He hopes that simplifying the finance code will make it easier for student leaders to understand what money they have access to and how to access it PERIOD

I want people to come out of the JC feeling like they were involved and cared for and to just spread that energy elsewhere so they can be successful Pinaula said PERIOD
