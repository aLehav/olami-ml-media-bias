What is my vote worth Doesnt the Electoral College decide everything anyway Why does it matter These are questions that many citizens ask themselves every four years when the presidential election comes around PERIOD

When it comes to the Electoral College deciding who the next president will be that is in fact accurate PERIOD But what is the Electoral College What is the popular vote The popular vote is the actual number of citizens who voted for one of the candidates PERIOD According to the New York Times The Electoral College is a group of people that elects the President and the Vice President of the United States. sounds pretty unfair right

Although we actually have more power than it sounds like. each person gets to vote for electors who are appointed by the political parties in each state PERIOD This means that you do not vote for the president directly but you can vote for an elector who is of the same political party as the candidate you want PERIOD However the electors do not have to vote for the candidate that is of the same political party as the one they were appointed PERIOD

So why is voting so important According to freshmen political science major Nick KellyWilson I feel like the people who can vote really need to because its our country and we need to be an active member of society. i happen to agree with KellyWilson because so many people complain about the policies in this country and fight for certain social issues but if you are not willing to vote how passionate can you be

KellyWilson also mentions the fact that Its actually the one hundredth anniversary of womens suffrage which is super cool and I feel like it would be like honestly as a woman super disrespectful to my ancestors if I did not vote because all these women fought for this right. i can speak to the same experience PERIOD Yes this year voting was definitely different and it was not how I dreamed my first time voting would be but it was incredibly empowering to have my first time voting be on the one hundredth anniversary of womens suffrage PERIOD

Unfortunately not everyone feels that way PERIOD In the  presidential election only . of eligible voters actually voted according to NPR and in our age group  only . of eligible voters voted according to the U.S PERIOD Census PERIOD Some people do not vote because they do not feel educated enough PERIOD Some feel that with all of the political tension and arguments it can be really challenging to pick a side without offending someone or starting a fight PERIOD

For the people who do not feel educated enough it is important to find a nonbiased website to get your information from so that you can become properly informed about the issues PERIOD I find that ISideWith.com is one of the best websites to get information from PERIOD

What I love about ISideWith.com is that they offer a voters quiz and based on your answers it suggests which presidential candidate you should vote for like a compatibility test for presidential candidates PERIOD

It is more than that though they rank your compatibility on every candidate PERIOD I find that it really helps these political barriers fall away and it could open your eyes to see these candidates and parties have some merit even if you do not agree with everything they may think PERIOD

The website also provides expandable information like more information discussion forums viewpoints from the political parties and statistics so if you are not informed on a particular issue you can educate yourself PERIOD You can also rank how important the issues are to you and answer more questions on the topics you are very interested in PERIOD",Voting in 2020: What is my vote worth? â€“ The Rider News,Rider University
