Insurgent

Directed by Robert Schwentke

Starring Shailene Woodley Theo James Miles Teller Ansel Elgort Kate Winslet

Rated PG13 for sequences of intense violence some sensuality thematic elements and language

Grade C

Despite its allstar cast and ongoing action the Divergent sequel ultimately cant live up to its promising predecessor PERIOD

Director Robert Schwentke best known for his  action film RED is in his element considering that much of Insurgent finds Tris Shailene Woodley and Four Theo James shooting people running from people or facing off against the wicked dictator Jeanine Matthews Kate Winslet PERIOD Jeanine wants to punish Divergents or citizens who exhibit characteristics from multiple factions  divisions that organize citizens by their aptitudes and values PERIOD Unfortunately much of the action is stilted or plain unbelievable PERIOD

The dystopian trope of unlikely girl finds inner strength and hot boyfriend to take down the government is still at play which is fine PERIOD Yet when that girl scales a floating burning building and swings from cords thousands of feet in the air it warrants a head scratch or two PERIOD

Insurgent picks up slightly after where the previous youngadult adaptation left off and finds wanted Divergents Tris Four Caleb Ansel Elgort and Peter Miles Teller hiding out in Amity the peaceloving faction PERIOD The lovable Octavia Spencer makes an appearance as the leader of Amity and for five minutes the world is calm PERIOD

Its here that Woodley begins her performance as Tris the Tormented  a task that she pulls off fairly well PERIOD Woodley as Tris is still an unfavorable casting but her performance is one of the films most engaging and poignant points PERIOD Tris blames herself for the deaths of people close to her and her grief drives the plot during the second half of the movie PERIOD Unfortunately the latter half of the movie is where the plot also loses momentum PERIOD

A large portion of the movie takes place in a simulation which isnt exactly the most riveting scenario in a dystopian universe PERIOD This is a questionable move by the writing team Brian Duffield Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback since the simulations are a fairly minor part of the book PERIOD The upside This sequence gives Teller more screen time and his oneliners become the most entertaining part of Insurgent. winslet gives a disappointing performance as Jeanine Matthews PERIOD She stays rooted in the same spot for most of the film focused on overseeing the factions and it makes her seem tired and bored PERIOD The movie eventually introduces us to her equal in age and power Factionless leader Evelyn Naomi Watts who seems more invested in her role PERIOD

There are many more Factionless members portrayed in this film than I initially thought existed which brings up another unbelievable element  if there are so many members and this city is completely enclosed by large walls how do they remain unseen Tris and Four are wanted criminals and Jeanines rogue Dauntless forces are constantly on the hunt PERIOD How has Jeanine not discovered the Factionless headquarters yet

These moments are better off ignored for the sake of enjoying the film which aside from the plot holes and the surfacelevel performances of some actors can be an entertaining dystopian adaptation PERIOD
