A farewell to four years of nerding out at The Aggie

By MARGO ROSENBAUM

Ive always loved stories PERIOD I spent much of my free time growing up at the library with my nose tucked into a nonfiction book  of course when I wasnt doing my other favorite things like poking starfish in tide pools hiking with my dogs in the woods pulling snails off sidewalks nerding out over nature documentaries making mud pies full of worms and riding any horse in need of exercise PERIOD

It was this love of storytelling especially about animals that brought me to the world of journalism PERIOD After much encouragement from my mom shoutout to Pam the strongest coolest woman ever I joined my high school paper PERIOD She was right I was a natural storyteller and needed a place to share my writing PERIOD In the words of one of her favorite artists the great Brandi Carlile  these stories dont mean anything  when youve got no one to tell them to. after discovering journalism my reality exploded I could talk to anyone write their story and share it with the world PERIOD I could do exactly what I saw in my favorite National Geographic books so many years beforewrite nonfiction I soon realized how easy it was for me to articulate my thoughts in a clear thoughtful and concise well Im still working on that one manner through writing PERIOD Im quite ebullient with the friends Im closest to but struggle with shyness and communicating with new people PERIOD With writing everything flowed easily PERIOD

As my love for journalism grew I knew Id want to write for the paper when I got to college PERIOD When I visited UC Davis on Decision Day in  I stopped by The Aggies booth and was encouraged to apply by the smiling faces of the student journalists who worked there including the talented Hannah Holzer who would later train me as managing editor PERIOD

Ultimately I picked UC Davis for a few reasons It was a public school in California not too far from home had a student barn for my horse and lastly because of The Aggie PERIOD As soon as staff writer vacancies opened up in the fall I applied right away and settled into my work on the features desk PERIOD I loved the flexibility of the section and the many random animal stories I soon became known for writing PERIOD The desk also introduced me to Anjini whom I biked past on the way to every desk meeting that year and would later lead The Aggie with for two years PERIOD Shes one of the smartest people I have ever met and shares my affirmation for storytelling student journalism Stargazer the Egghead and dinosaurs but sadly not birds or lizards PERIOD

My time on the features desk was glorious but short lived PERIOD After one dinosaur course and a marine biology class I got hooked on the sciences at UC Davis and decided to add a second major related to biology PERIOD Many of my features articles also started swaying toward research so I switched to the science and technology desk during the summer before my second year PERIOD As the only science writer on the desk at the time I worked with the editor Cecilia and learned how to cover science in an exciting digestible manner PERIOD

Suddenly everything just clicked I learned I could combine my compassion for animals fascination with research zeal for saving the environment and love for storytelling PERIOD Writing about science in a clear jargonfree manner felt like my contribution to combating misinformation and protecting the Earth PERIOD

After one year on the science desk as a staff writer and assistant editor I made the gigantic leap to becoming managing editor PERIOD While yes there were many overwhelming chaotic moments I could not be happier to have worked in this role for the past two years PERIOD I came to love my cozy Sunday editing nights spending hours reading all the content coming out that week PERIOD My editing and reporting skills improved tremendously by reading so many stories by The Aggies many talented writers PERIOD As managing editor I also continued reporting and assigned myself multiple challenging articles that took weeks to write PERIOD I investigated barriers to voting in Davis UC health care coverage agricultural research in Davis and so much more PERIOD

From the friendships Ive made to the pickleball games Ive lost The Aggie made me fall in love with this cow town so much more than any club I tried out class I took or professor I nervously chatted up during office hours. i can easily proclaim these past years with The Aggie as the best four years of my life PERIOD Im extremely grateful and lucky to have worked with one incredible editorinchief two talented Editorial Boards and managing staffs as well as too many staffers to count PERIOD Im humbled by the impressive reporting of all the great friends Ive made at The Aggie PERIOD

From the friendships Ive made to the pickleball games Ive lost The Aggie made me fall in love with this cow town so much more than any club I tried out class I took or professor I nervously chatted up during office hours PERIOD Despite this Ill still miss banding baby Western Bluebirds and Tree Swallows eating out way too often in Downtown Davis catching snakes and lizards at Lake Berryessa chaotic tubing adventures along Putah Creek late night study sessions at Shields Library sponsored by Scandinavian Swimmers BBQs at home sneaking into the Arboretum on my horse Nina and way too many more favorites to list PERIOD

Its true what they say about UC Davis the nicest people youll ever meet go to school here PERIOD Id say that Ive picked some of the greatest as my friends PERIOD Kylie you get me like almost nobody else PERIOD Thank you to the student housing gods for placing us in the same dorm room and somehow four years later I still absolutely love living together PERIOD Youre an incredible writer and plant biologist and Im so excited to see all the places you go PERIOD Alana thank you for cooking me the most gourmet meals and for nerding out about Star Wars with me PERIOD Thank you to everyone on the Editorial Board for the past two years I appreciate all of the shenanigans the stories the support and the snorts of laughter PERIOD

Ben while youre not a UC Davis student it almost feels like you are PERIOD Thank you for being such an integral part of my college career waking up with me at  a.m PERIOD on Picnic Day performing at Whole Earth Festival taking care of Nina and helping me write this senior column every time I got too sad and overwhelmed to finish PERIOD Im so grateful to enter this next part of life with you PERIOD

Thank you to my family for their nonstop support throughout my life PERIOD Mom thank you for pushing me to become a journalist so many years ago and for birthing me  I literally wouldnt be here without you PERIOD Dad thank you for imparting your love of adventure and will to do it all onto me PERIOD Youve made me a dreamer and helped me realize that I can achieve anything PERIOD Laurel thank you for being my role model and a very cool older sister PERIOD I hope to be half as successful as you one day PERIOD Nina thank you for having the squishiest nose and for being my emotional support horse all throughout college PERIOD

As my time at UC Davis comes to a close The Aggie will surely be the hardest goodbye I have to make PERIOD Im sorry to say goodbye to editing on Sunday evenings Editorial Board meetings Tuesday layout sessions with JJAM the many stacks of old papers the coziness of Lower Freeborn my dark but lovely corner desk at  A Street all of our wall quotes my many beautiful Doodle Polls all of my wonderful colleaguesfriends and so so so much more PERIOD Its bittersweet to move on but Im so glad to see The Aggie left in such proficient hands PERIOD

My journey into the world of storytelling is far from over PERIOD Whatever my next job in life ends up being I know Ill never stop writing and loving every minute of it PERIOD Stay tuned for loads more weird nerdy but interesting science content I plan to write PERIOD As I bid farewell to my incredibly fond days of student journalism I give a delighted hello to my professional science writing career PERIOD
