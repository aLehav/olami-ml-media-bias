A spring tradition at Cal State East Bay made its return on Saturday as students and guests flooded the amphitheater for Spring Mayhem formerly referred to as Spring Fest PERIOD

The event featured student acts a band performance and was headlined by Bay Area rapper PLo and Compton rapper YG PERIOD

During YGs set he announced to the crowd that because of contractual obligations he was not allowed to perform three of his songs that included Suu Whoop Meet the Flockas and Fk Donald Trump. yG then asked the crowd which one he should perform and many of the attendees shouted Fk Donald Trump. im about to jeopardize my check YG said during his performance PERIOD I do it for the people I dont give a fk about none of that other shit. the song Fk Donald Trump came on and the beat played for a few seconds before the music was turned down and his microphone was cut off PERIOD At the time of publication it was still unclear who made the decision to stop the song and cut off YGs microphone PERIOD

YG danced with a member of his team for less than a minute before exiting the stage PERIOD The crowd booed and chanted for him to return to the stage which he eventually did but did not perform any more songs PERIOD The DJ played Rich the Kids Plug Walk remix that features YG which ended the event PERIOD
