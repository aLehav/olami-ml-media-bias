Lewis  Clark has one of the most atheistic student bodies in the United States PERIOD The Princeton Review recently ranked LC as the fourteenth least religious college in the US and in  Huffington Post put LC at number two on a list of least religious colleges PERIOD Many LC students strongly identify with the atheistic culture on campus PERIOD

I went on a tour and the guide said we were the godless campus which was funny and also what I was looking for Lia Bernhard  said PERIOD

Atheists find LCs godless campus appealing PERIOD Nate Whitley  considered going to a Christian college PERIOD Back home in Medford Oregon most of his friends were religious PERIOD

I decided not to go to a Christian college because I wanted to have a less structured thinking process Whitley said PERIOD For me I think its more interesting to use methods like science or art even to discover my world rather than read about it or be told what the answers are. while organized religion creates a sense of community through regular gatherings LCs atheist culture is characterized by the social environment PERIOD Atheists may not necessarily have meetings every Sunday but their presence opens up the conversation about students beliefs PERIOD

Liberal arts have always attracted people who like to ask questions Bernhard said PERIOD It makes it easier for me to voice my opinions about religion in class because I have a sense that people are either open minded about my views or that theyll agree. however according to Mark Duntley Dean of Religious and Spiritual Life LCs atheist culture can alienate religious students PERIOD

People who are strongly religious come here every year and its sometimes challenging Duntley said PERIOD But oftentimes theyve grown a lot in their own understanding too since not everyone around them has the same thinking. the college was founded on the principles of the Presbyterian Church that saw education as a means for human improvement and a way to help students open their minds by developing themselves academically emotionally and spiritually PERIOD

Ive seen people be really rude and nasty in a way that they would never do to a person of color or a lesbian because they see religion as a personal choice as opposed to an identity Duntley said PERIOD He told a story of something that happened after he gave a short prayer at convocation this year PERIOD One religious student who was missing home approached him afterwards PERIOD She told him when she quietly said Amen along with Duntley her roommate scoffed You werent really praying were you

That was her first experience of sharing who she was with someone who was not religious and who was very hostile and that made her feel self conscious about it Duntley said adding that student decided to keep her religion to herself from then on PERIOD

To be a caring atheist culture the first thing you should do instead of criticizing or ridiculing religious people is be open and curious about it and not making preconceived assumptions Duntley said PERIOD You can be a bigot against religion just as you can be a bigoted religious person. however many atheist students like Bernhard are more accepting of other peoples beliefs PERIOD

Religion or spirituality gives a sense of community and comfort and theres nothing wrong with that Bernhard said PERIOD I will fight for your right to practice your religion. duntley too recognizes the importance of an inclusive campus PERIOD I can support anyone I can be spiritual and not religious he said PERIOD

I think the main goal for everyone here is acceptance Bernhard said PERIOD
