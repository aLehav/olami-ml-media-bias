2238,2022-03-16,"beginning Friday the University of Chicago will host its fifty-first Annual Folk Festival in Mandel Hall and Ida Noyes for three days PERIOD This years festival will continue to preserve the traditional music of the past but with modern day artists and the rebirth of old genres PERIOD

The University of Chicago Folk Festival has become a nationally renowned event drawing in people from all around the country to play and listen to folk PERIOD The festival is carefully planned with board members booking musicians as far as a year in advance due to the difficulty in finding performers of such an old genre of music PERIOD

Sometimes we saythat the only bands that are traditional enough for us are the ones that are dead and hiring living ones are a compromise said Ezra DeutschFeldman a  U of C graduate returning to help with this years festival PERIOD

In addition to folk bluegrass Irish and Cajun each year the board tries to include a different genre PERIOD This year will be gospel a genre that hasnt been included in the festival for some time with the Evening Light Brothers performing PERIOD

This year we decided to feature a gospel group which lets us promote something that is popular locally as a part of Chicago said Alexa Silverman one of the copresidents of this years Festival PERIOD

The Folk Festival serves as a place not only to hear traditional music but also to meet the musicians who are the best in their field and who are willing to talk to Festival attendees PERIOD

I play banjo and guitar DeutschFeldman said PERIOD If I can work up the courage to ask the musicians I try to play some music with them or at least get some advice from them. some musicians attending this year are a familiar sight to the Folk Festival PERIOD This will be the fifth year for John Williams who will perform traditional music of Ireland on piano and concertino PERIOD Williams performed in the movie The Road to Perdition where he was commissioned to compose and teach an Irish piece to Paul Newman and Tom Hanks PERIOD

I feel like its a national venue Mandel Hall and the music is presented at a very high level Williams said PERIOD

He looks forward to performing on Mandel Halls Steinway piano PERIOD

I play piano in a traditional manner and its primarily for dance music PERIOD Im looking forward to having that large piano under my fingertips and belting out some great music Williams said PERIOD

While Williams will be returning to Mandel Hall for the fifth time this year will be some artists first PERIOD Mike Compton a bluegrass musician will be attending for the first time to lead the Bluegrass Workshop PERIOD Compton played mandolin on two Grammy awardwinning pieces in  and has traveled the globe playing

music PERIOD

Im looking forward to meeting some new people in Chicago and to be able to play with some of my friends said Compton PERIOD Ive found that music communicates when words fail and seems to be the great common denominator. even if one is not familiar with traditional folk music the Festival is a great place to become acquainted with this timeless genre PERIOD

Folk is kind of like an old antique that has been lovingly cared for and still has had its few battle scars said fiddler Bobby Taylor who will lead the Fiddle Styles workshop PERIOD It is something that is wholesome timeless and just wonderful and if anyone gives it a chance and a listen and tries to understand a little bit of the history and the soul and spirit of the musician the welcome mat is out for them. your donation will support the student journalists of University of Chicago PERIOD Your contributions go towards our annual website hosting costs and equipment costs PERIOD
