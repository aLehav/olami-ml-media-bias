FILE  Carrie Fisher presents the life achievement award on stage at the twenty-first annual Screen Actors Guild Awards Jan PERIOD   at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles PERIOD Fisher died at  Dec PERIOD   PERIOD

I was saddened but not heartbroken by many celebrity deaths in  Alan Rickman Prince Gene Wilder George Michael PERIOD But one death has affected me far more than the others  the death of a princess or rather a general PERIOD

When A New Hope came out in  Carrie Fisher provided young women with something they often lacked representation of a witty independent and strong young woman on screen PERIOD Although the Star Wars franchise fitting with its time only featured one female main character among a cast of predominantly men Princess Leia Organa became a fan favorite with her fearlessness and intelligence PERIOD Her character serves as a role model for any young woman who grew up watching the Star Wars movies  which is a lot of young women considering the movies just keep coming PERIOD

Im sure there are lots of people out there who idolize young Carrie Fisher probably in her iconic slave outfit but it is the Carrie Fisher of recent years whom I like best brash bold outspoken funny as hell PERIOD It was a joy to follow her on Twitter and try to decipher hertweetswritten entirely in emojis PERIOD She spoke out for what she believed in while also showing that she didnt take life too seriously PERIOD

Carrie Fisher was so much more than her iconic role as Princess Leia PERIOD She was open about her struggles with addiction and mental illness and she was a pro at turning tragedy into comedy PERIOD She was an ace in her field always correcting scripts  both her lines and others  to improve whatever she was acting in PERIOD She was a talented author selling millions of copies of both memoirs and novels PERIOD And above all she brought the world joy from her silly pictures with her therapy dog Gary to her cameos in television shows like  Rock and The Big Bang Theory. beyond her extraordinary talent both onscreen and off Carrie was an outspoken advocate for those suffering from mental illness and addiction PERIOD By being so open about her own struggles with drug addiction alcoholism and bipolar disorder  most notably in her onewoman show and subsequent book Wishful Drinking  she helped to destigmatize the pain of mental illness PERIOD She added her voice to a conversation crucial to normalizing the occurrence and treatment of mental disorders and addiction diseases PERIOD I personally looked up to her and her battle against bipolar disorder inspired my own PERIOD

Before her death Carrie ran anadvice columnwith The Guardian PERIOD A young 20something who also had bipolar disorder wrote to her asking Have you found a way to feel at peace

Carrie penned a kind yet straightforwardresponse PERIOD She wrote back with empathy and encouragement PERIOD

We have been given a challenging illness and there is no other option than to meet those challenges she replied PERIOD As your bipolar sister Ill be watching PERIOD Now get out there and show me you what you can do. so when you watch as the world continues to open up about mental illness and those who suffer from such are able to find community and hope rather than isolation and despair thank Carrie Fisher PERIOD When you watch as female characters become stronger smarter more independent thank Carrie Fisher PERIOD When you watch as people come together to combine laughing at lifes small slipups while also fighting for whats right thank Carrie Fisher PERIOD

Finally I will honor Carrie with the obituary she requested in her  autobiography Wishful Drinking On Dec PERIOD   Carrie Fisher drowned in moonlight strangled by her own bra PERIOD She is survived by her mother daughter and therapy dog Gary PERIOD May the force be with you always Carrie PERIOD
