With graduation in the past and SpringintoSummer courses well underway  marine science students prepare for a hands on experience of a lifetime  research in Cuba PERIOD

Tuesday morning the class led by Associate Professor of Marine Science and Biology William Szelistowski boarded a plane to take them to Havana Cuba PERIOD After having arrived in the secluded country the class will travel to the Isle de la Juventud Isle of Youth the largest offshore island in Cuba PERIOD The students will spend six nights on a research vessel in order to conduct reef fish research explore the invasive lionfish species and contribute to an existing shark project PERIOD

Following the six nights on the water the students will return to the Isle de la Juventud where they will continue with shark sampling and contribute to the universitys manatee project PERIOD

All of these research projects belong to the University of Havanas Center for Marine Research PERIOD The Eckerd students will join five other Cuban students to conduct this research PERIOD

Its the first of what we hope is going to be a long history of interactions said Szelistowski PERIOD We plan on continuing educational programs and sending students to Cuba and maybe bringing some Cuban students here. the class has met once a week throughout the spring semester to prepare for the trip PERIOD

Im super excited to interact with other undergraduates from the University of Havana said Junior Takoda Edlund PERIOD Its one thing to go and see culture from a tourists point of viewbut to actually interact and speak and have some conversations with some other sameage students just like us in Marine Science and see what theyre learning versus what we are learning is going to be really cool. before President Obama made his announcement to normalize relations with the Cuban government Eckerd College already set plans in motion to develop a relationship with the University of Havana PERIOD This trip will serve as the first major interaction between the schools PERIOD

Im going in pretty openminded said Senior Tanner Morris PERIOD I dont really know what to expect PERIOD I kind of want to just soak it all in for what its worth and really just get an experience out of it. following a successful Winter Term trip to Cuba in January and the expected success of this trip Eckerd plans to send three different classes to Cuba next Winter Term with the possibility of an added marine science course PERIOD
