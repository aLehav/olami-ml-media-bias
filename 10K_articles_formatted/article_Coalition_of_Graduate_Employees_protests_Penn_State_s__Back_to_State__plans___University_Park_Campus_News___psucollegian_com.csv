Students in the Coalition of Graduate Employees protesting Penn States  plans PERIOD

As the fall  semester quickly approaches concerns about the safety of Penn State students staff and faculty persist PERIOD

Thats why on July  the Coalition of Graduate Employees sought to address some of these worries during a diein protest on Old Main Lawn in which participants laid down on the ground for  minutes to represent the over  coronavirus deaths that had occurred nationwide PERIOD

Protest attendees feel the university has not considered the full ramifications of reopening in the fall and believe administrators should be more transparent about their decisionmaking processes PERIOD

Maggie Hernandez a coalition organizer said the group chose to protest with a diein to demonstrate the severity of reopening in the fall PERIOD Hernandez graduateanthropology called it a powerful form of protest that has been utilized for decades PERIOD

If students returned we dont have the medical infrastructure which will ultimately result in the death of individuals in the Centre County region Hernandez said PERIOD We wanted to make sure the message is getting across that the university should value lives over profit. students in the Coalition of Graduate Employees staging a  protest on Old Main Lawn PERIOD

The coalition created a list of demands for Penn State leaders to address one being to move classes completely online while ensuring everyone has access to remote learning PERIOD

Invest in resources to ensure the students who are taking classes online have the resources and support they need to succeed Hernandez said PERIOD

Hernandez added that the organization is urging the university to release numerical thresholds of cases that would need to be passed in order for campus to be shut down PERIOD She described the figure as representing how many people university administrators are willing to let die and let get infected before sending students home PERIOD

The coalitions final demand is to keep international students at the forefront when making decisions so as not to jeopardize their lives or education according to Hernandez PERIOD

Bailey Campbell another coalition organizer said the university has been really opaque throughout its decisionmaking process PERIOD Campbell doctorateelectrical engineering said the group wants the university to specifically address their demands rather than release press statements PERIOD

What we want is answers to our demands Campbell said PERIOD

Hernandez said there is a lot of conflict within the statements released by the university specifically the notion that Penn State is within the Pennsylvania Department of Healths outlined requirements for reopening PERIOD She explained that some local medical professionals have even joined the protest since theyre currently overwhelmed by a lack of resources PERIOD

With a large university in such a small town Hernandez said its important for administrators to consider the surrounding community when making decisions PERIOD

So far according to Campbell the coalition has seen an overwhelming amount of support from the community and those affiliated with the university PERIOD She added that many people have reached out to the coalition asking how they can become involved with upcoming events and protests PERIOD

Campbell said the coalition encourages other groups on campus  such as undergraduates faculty and staff to become involved and amplify their voices as well PERIOD

But responses to the organizations protests arent just coming from the Penn State community either PERIOD Campbell said the coalition has received responses from students across the country who were inspired to pressure their own universities to move classes online PERIOD

However the coalition has yet to hear an official response from Penn State PERIOD Campbell said the only word theyve heard is the same tired line about organizing task forces to ensure campusgoers will be safe in the fall PERIOD

It doesnt matter how many task forces you have theres no possible way to have a safe return in the fall Campbell said PERIOD

The coalition also created a petition to pressure university leaders to move classes online PERIOD According to Campbell an email is sent to  university administrators every time someone signs it PERIOD

The Coalition of Graduate Employees staged a  protest outside of Old Main PERIOD

Since sending the emails Campbell said the coalition received one response from an administrator who said they were unsure what the right answer for the fall semester is PERIOD However the administrator said the coalitions work was making an impact on other administrators PERIOD

According to Hernandez the administrator said many of the coalitions concerns were not being discussed at the university level and that they believe the university is more concerned with profit than students PERIOD

But while returning to campus is an issue that touches many people associated with the university graduate students feel particularly concerned PERIOD As teachers many expressed concern for the safety of their students PERIOD

Katie Warczak another coalition organizer said she was motivated to attend the protest after discovering a high school classmate had died from coronavirus complications PERIOD Warczak graduateEnglish and African American studies said she doesnt want to see her students or friends suffer the same fate PERIOD

If it can happen to him it can happen to anyone Warczak said PERIOD There are too many people who have similar stories. hernandez said the university should make a decision regarding whether classes will move online sooner rather than later to give students adequate time to prepare PERIOD She said Penn State is robbing graduate students of the time to plan for remote learning and the accommodations it requires PERIOD

We have our students in mind when were thinking about all of this Hernandez said PERIOD

Coalition organizers have been debriefing to discuss the protests success and they are looking to plan future events at their next meeting PERIOD Warczak said they are also aiming to partner with other organizations on campus for future protests PERIOD

The pressure will not stop Hernandez said PERIOD
