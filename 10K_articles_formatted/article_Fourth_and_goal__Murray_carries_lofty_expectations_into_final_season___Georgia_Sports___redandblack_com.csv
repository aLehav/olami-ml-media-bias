It is not rare to hear football players say every yard counts. though not quite insightful the phrase is considered a fairly inarguable claim another truth in a game with many PERIOD

But for Aaron Murrayevery yard counts is a painful reminder of how close he came to finishing off Alabama in the Southeastern Conference Championship game last December PERIOD It is what he hears in his sleep PERIOD It is what drives him in the morning PERIOD

It is perhaps for that final fiveyard deficiency alone that Murray returns to Georgia this fall for one last crack at a national title PERIOD

Every night it goes through my mind PERIOD Ive watched that game four times now Murray said PERIOD 

Georgia football is back with players reporting to practice as soon as July  PERIOD

But for Murray the season never really ended PERIOD Even while the wounds were still fresh he took almost no time in revisiting the C.J PERIOD Mosley tipped pass that wobbled into Chris Conleys arms as the clock expired PERIOD

Aaron watched the film the next day PERIOD He wanted to go that night

 said Mosley now a senior linebacker with the Crimson Tide PERIOD 

With the experience of that heartbreaking defeat in his back pocket Murray returns to Athens as a battlehardened veteran with three years of SEC experience a year older and perhaps wiser too.The Tampa Fla PERIOD native has seen plenty of ups and downs since taking the reins of Georgias offense and since the seasons conclusion hes become even more comfortable as a vocal leader PERIOD

I guess Ive had my time of having fun PERIOD Im an old man now Murray joked. those closest to the team have seen growth in Georgias quarterback as well PERIOD Whether leading teammates through voluntary summer practices or spending time in the film room Murray has taken on an expansive role in making sure the Bulldogs are prepared for the season PERIOD

Murray even took it upon himself to create a new method of organizing and leading the team through summer workouts PERIOD After collaborating with a pair of UGA professors involved in his graduate Psychology program he devised a system of breaking the team up into several small groups each led by an upperclassman responsible for making sure players show up PERIOD

The incentive Each member of the group with the best attendance record for the first and second halves of the summer wins a free meal at Longhorn Steakhouse PERIOD

 Murray said.Its been great PERIOD If someone in your group misses a workout youre hearing about it from someone else in the group because everyone wants that free Longhorns dinner. richt said PERIOD

While Murray has drawn rave reviews off the field theres a strong chance he could do serious damage on game days too PERIOD

After throwing for his third straight 3000yard season and posting the nations secondbest passer efficiency rating at . murray enters the season on a plethora of watch lists for honors such as the Maxwell Award and the Davey OBrien Award.However he was only named ThirdTeam Preseason AllSEC by media members behind Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel and Alabamas A.J PERIOD McCarron PERIOD

A ThirdTeam slection certainly speaks to the impressive talent at quarterback in the SEC but Lynchfelt he had to disagree with the medias ruling PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

He came back to win an SEC Championship a national championship PERIOD Thats what we all want to do as a program and I think we will Lynch said PERIOD

Georgia senior quarterback Aaron Murray has been named to the  Manning Quarterback Award Watch List according to an announcement Friday b
