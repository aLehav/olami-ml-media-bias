Director Zack Snyder reunites the Caped Crusader Batman and the Man of Steel Superman with other heroes after last years disaster Batman V PERIOD Superman Dawn of Justice. this time Snyder brings in The Flash Ezra Miller Aquaman Jason Momoa Cyborg Ray Fisher and Wonder Woman Gal Gadot for the new movie Justice League. however can these heroes save the day

Snyder has undoubtedly been the most hated director in theDC Universe in recent years PERIOD He made the worlds greatest heroes and heroines look like the worst in The Man of Steel when Superman ends up killing General Zod PERIOD Superman isnt known for killing his enemiesso it was a bad idea to have him kill in the first movie PERIOD Justice League starts off at night showing Batman on patrol in Gotham City PERIOD Meanwhile Superman is still dead theres a bomb threat in Paris and a talented football player has been turned into a machine PERIOD

Some heroes including Aquaman Cyborg and The Flash had their debut on the big screen PERIOD Between Snyders script Momoas stature and the reputation the actor gained from his role in HBOs hit series Game of Thrones Aquaman is a complete beast PERIOD

Cyborgs story in the film starts off slowly as Victor Stone a young man who had a bright future in football is already half man half machine hiding from society in his fathers apartment PERIOD Eventually the strong use of special effects and Fishers voice allowed Cyborg to play his part for both the team and the movie PERIOD

Popular character The Flash is conveyed differently from Grant Gustins character on The CWs show The Flash. millers character is a lot more childish and overall annoying PERIOD While The Flash is supposed to be childish Snyders scripting for him seems like overkill to the point where his portrayal of the character is more of a highlycaffeinated child than a hero PERIOD

Gadot returns as Wonder Woman and her performance is justas great as it was in this summers Wonder Woman movie PERIOD This time more of the heros abilities are put to the test from deflecting bullets with her bracelets of submission to using the lasso of truth to interrogate the adversary PERIOD

Afflecks portrayal of Batman is absolutely perfect PERIOD Snyder was able to bring to life the Batman seen in the comics by his use of gadgets and combat PERIOD In previous Batman movies such as Christopher Nolans Batman the characters combat is very stiff his grappling gun was nowhere to be found but Snyder brought everything about the heroto life PERIOD Afflecks Batman is very similar to comic writer Frank Millers interpretation of the original character in the story arc The Dark Knight Returns with his stature and suit PERIOD

Superman is still Snyders Superman however audiences finally see what Superman can do in the movie instead of just fly and cry PERIOD Ever since Man of Steel fans have been waiting to see Supermans heat vision Xray vision cold breath and super speed PERIOD Snyders Superman in the past was conservative as he was reluctant to use anything other than his ability to fly which defeated the purpose of his name PERIOD

The films plot is almost too simple which left critics and fans angry PERIOD However there are three powerful devices called mother boxes and an unfamiliar main antagonist Steppenwolf is after them with his clich plan to destroy the world PERIOD

Justice League struggles to build up suspense since almost every event is predictable and there is too much computergenerated imagery in the wrong places PERIOD Snyder took a risk by using all of these new heroes and it was just too soon PERIOD The Flash Aquaman and Cyborg needed their movies first PERIOD Aquaman is releasing in  while Flashpoint and Cyborg arent hitting the big screen until  PERIOD Justice League is currently playing in local theatres PERIOD
