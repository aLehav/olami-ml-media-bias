By RACHEL SHEY  citytheaggie.org

All Things Right  Relevant a Davis thrift and consignment nonprofit on Spafford Street donated to suicide prevention for the month of December with contributions of up to  matched by the organizations board of directors according to the general manager Lynne Okamuro PERIOD

The nonprofit has benefited mental health organizations since its inception PERIOD It currently works with nine charities PERIOD

Were a nonprofit consignment store and we work with mental health organizations and charities in Yolo County Okamuro said PERIOD When somebody either wants to donate or consign we take in most clothing and household goods as long as they are in good quality condition. the consignment portion of the nonprofit operates with a staggered pricing system where prices drop over time PERIOD Profits are distributed to charities at the end of the year PERIOD

With consignment the consigner gets  of the money from the sale and the nonprofit gets  PERIOD The consignment period is  days Okamuro said PERIOD Prices go down over time it will spend  days at full price  days at  off and  days at  off which incentivizes people to buy it a little quicker PERIOD If we do end up making profit in a year we distribute the amount to charities PERIOD Last year was a little rough so we didnt do the distribution PERIOD I was hoping that this year we will be able to distribute some money. in the 1990s the founders of the nonprofit wanted to help mental health organizations with fundraising according to their website PERIOD They decided that the best way to do this was to open a thrift store therefore also reducing their environmental impact by recycling unwanted goods and finding them new homes PERIOD

Fundraising has been a longstanding dilemma for nonprofits in Yolo County and elsewhere the website reads PERIOD The need for additional revenue sources had become increasingly apparent in the late 1980s as California slipped into the deepest recession in recent memory and traditional funding sources dried up. all Things Right  Relevant started as thrift and eventually added consignment. okamuro briefly broke down the difference between thrift and consignment PERIOD

Consignment is where we sell an item for you so you still own the item and if it sells you get a portion and we get a portion Okamuro said PERIOD Thrift is that you are donating the item and not getting any money PERIOD If a consigned item does not sell within  days it becomes a donation. all Things Right  Relevant sees more consignment than donation among other interesting trends that Okamuro noticed PERIOD Most of the stores revenue comes from jewelry but the largest volume of goods is in clothing PERIOD

I would say about  of what you see in our main store is a consignment item Okamuro said PERIOD I would say that we are about  womens clothing PERIOD We have a lot of female consigners and the rest are nonclothing or mens clothing PERIOD I dont know why that is we just have fewer male consigners but if you do bring in mens clothing your item is one of the few options available so its more likely to be bought PERIOD Our best sellers vary from season to season PERIOD Most of the year its womens blouses PERIOD This time of the year its usually outerwear and womens dresses. okamuro also added that another mission of All Things Right  Relevant is to employ those with mental health diagnoses PERIOD All employees at the nonprofit are mental health clients from local agencies PERIOD

We rely on our  mental health agencies to refer mental health clients to work in our Thrift Store Okamuro said via email PERIOD Most of our clients have come from Yolo County Department of Mental Health Yolo Community Care Continuum YCCC Communicare and Pine Tree Gardens. written by Rachel Shey  citytheaggie.org
