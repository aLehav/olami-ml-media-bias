A sudden spike in payroll fraud at the University is raising questions about how departments around campus are handling payroll PERIOD

In the past two months there have been two reported cases of payroll fraud and two cases of attempted payroll fraud according to LSU Police Department Spokesman Capt PERIOD Cory Lalonde PERIOD

The first case was reported Jan PERIOD  after a student working for the chemistry department was suspected of forging her supervisors signature on  separate time sheets and collecting an income of approximately  over a years time PERIOD

The chemistry department declined to comment on the incident PERIOD

The second case was reported on Feb PERIOD  after a student working at the Louisiana Digital Media Center submitted false payroll sheets to his supervisor with forged signatures of approval collecting  of false income PERIOD

Last week two student workers from the Cox Communications building were under suspicion of attempting payroll fraud causing an investigation by LSUPD that revealed the two students were falsifying the hours on their time sheets to collect more pay PERIOD

All four students were arrested and booked into East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on felony charges for committing payroll fraud and falsifying public records PERIOD However all four students are currently still enrolled in the University PERIOD

K.C White associate vice chancellor and dean of students said students found in violation of the LSU Student Code of Conduct have the option to meet with a staff member of the LSU Student Advocacy and Accountability Department to explain their case PERIOD Any potential finding of responsibility would then fall within a range of outcomes such as disciplinary probation or expulsion PERIOD

Lalonde said student payroll fraud typically involves a suspect submitting their time sheets with their supervisors signatures forged onto the document or leaving the workplace immediately after clocking in for the job and then returning later to clock out PERIOD

Lalonde said when a payroll manager realizes something is off in the record books they typically have a suspect in mind before reporting the case to the authorities PERIOD

The police department will always have to investigate further to ensure that we have all the information and facts possible in any situation. lalonde said PERIOD More often than not youre going to have some idea who the person is solely because of the fact that everything is on record by the supervisors. lalonde said the majority of payroll fraud investigations are spent not on who committed the fraud but how the suspect committed the crime PERIOD

Director of LSU Payroll Donna Dewailly said each department payroll division on campus has its own procedures of preventing payroll fraud within the system PERIOD

Dewailly said incidents of fraud are sometimes discovered by supervisors after the suspects receive pay for days they were never scheduled to work PERIOD

Preventing payroll fraud is not an easy thing to do but making the switch from paper to electronic time sheets could be safer depending on the situation Dewailly said PERIOD

Even though two of the four payroll fraud cases involve students forging signatures on their time sheets Dewailly said no student should have the opportunity to forge their supervisors signatures on their time sheets. lSUPD remains ultimately unaware why the sudden spike in payroll fraud occurred and is unsure if the trend will continue to grow PERIOD

Lalonde said it is difficult for LSUPD to directly combat payroll fraud on campus but the department will do what it can to educate supervisors that deal with payroll documents on taking the extra time to verify the necessary paperwork involved with payroll PERIOD
