He Said

You wont find anything more American than the Super Bowl PERIOD A sport that the rest of the world refers to as American football and overcommercialization that would even make Black Friday advertisers blush PERIOD It truly has it all PERIOD

As sports editor I am required to enjoy the football aspect the most but that doesnt stop me from loving everything that makes the Super Bowl what it is PERIOD

Despite the supposed warnings of  cult movie classic They Live I see no problems with the overcommercialization of society especially when it comes to the big productions that are Super Bowl advertisements PERIOD

My parents were the founders of the Society for the Commercialization of Christmas so a love for the gaudy excess of the Super Bowl is inherited PERIOD

Speaking of my family this leads me to my second nonfootball love of the Super Bowl  the food PERIOD My family started a tradition in  by having a big dinner made up of foods local to the teams in the big game PERIOD

Its a great way to try some new foods you might not otherwise and lets face it any excuse to eat way too much delicious food is a good one PERIOD

Super Bowl Sunday is essentially a national holiday just without the time off of work or school PERIOD In other words if youre watching the game alone youve messed up PERIOD

This season the big game is in New York City or thats what the National Football League desperately hopes you think PERIOD Its really in a truly depressing place called East Rutherford N.J PERIOD

New Jersey is bad enough on its own but in the winter it is too cold to be hosting such an important event PERIOD If I was made commissioner of the NFL the game would never leave New Orleans PERIOD All national sporting events should be held in New Orleans PERIOD

The game itself should be a great one PERIOD Both Seattle and Denver are excellent teams and deserve to be playing for it all PERIOD Weve enjoyed a nice run of six straight good close Super Bowl games and I expect this one to be no different PERIOD

So gather some friends and food pile around the television and celebrate everything that make America great PERIOD

She Said

Viral beer commercials empty chip aisles and bandwaggoning fans can only mean one thing Super Bowl Sunday PERIOD

As someone who only sort of considers herself a professional football fan its hard not to get kind of excited about the big game that will finally bring football season to a close PERIOD

The culture around the Super Bowl really makes it so anyone football fan or not can enjoy the festivities PERIOD Whether its the game itself the adorable puppyhorseArnold Schwarzenegger commercials or the halftime show theres really something for everyone on Super Bowl Sunday PERIOD

Speaking of the halftime show can we all just take a minute and realize its been  years since the infamous Janet Jackson incident A whole decade Hard to imagine most of us were between the ages of  and  PERIOD If only DVR had been a thing back then PERIOD

After that incident can you blame the Super Bowl producers for playing it safe for the next two years with halftime acts What could possibly malfunction with Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones other then their heart rate monitors or hearing aids

I feel pretty apathetic about Bruno Mars performing this year PERIOD Sure hes likeable and popular but hes definitely no Beyonc PERIOD How exciting can Locked Out of Heaven and Just the Way You Are be Can you really put pyrotechnics behind When I Was Your Man I think not PERIOD

For those of you that are totally against the consumerism athleticism and mainstreamness of the game talking to all the hipsters out there theres always the Puppy Bowl PERIOD I mean come on how can you go wrong with  adorable puppies playing in a ministadium

I on the other hand will be rooting for the Seahawks PERIOD You have an awesome fanbase a dynamic defense and Kam Chancellor who is a former Hokie PERIOD

May the best team win
