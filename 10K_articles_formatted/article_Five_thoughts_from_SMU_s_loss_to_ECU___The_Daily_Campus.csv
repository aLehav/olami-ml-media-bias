 SMU found its STAR linebacker Kyran Mitchell started at the star linebacker spot and made an early impact PERIOD He shined on East Carolinas second and third series PERIOD He read ECU quarterback Blake Kemp perfectly on a third down and picked off his pass PERIOD On the next drive he sniffed out a counter play and prevented ECU running back Chris Hairston from a big gain PERIOD The very next play he recovered from a cutblock near the hash marks to assist on a tackle on a screen pass to force a fourth down PERIOD He gave up a 35yard completion but he also didnt have any safety help PERIOD Hes more of a linebacker than a defensive back which I think SMU needs given its struggles to stop the run PERIOD

 Jeremiah Gaines is here SMUs tight end had three catches for  yards in the first half PERIOD Sixty of the yards came on a touchdown pass off a deflection but he showed his speed as he outran ECUs secondary to the end zone PERIOD On another catch he came out the backfield easily dispatched a blocker and took a short pass for  yards PERIOD Gaines play made Courtland Suttons quiet first half much less of an issue PERIOD SMUs offense will be much more dangerous if it gets a consistent second threat in the passing game PERIOD

 Readoption struggles continue James Summers came in at quarterback in the second quarter and ran the readoption well right away leading ECU to two touchdowns on his first two drives PERIOD He kept SMU offbalance by waiting until the last minute to keep or pull on readoptions PERIOD Darrion Richardson expertly contained Summers on third and three with  seconds to go in the first half but other than that ECU ripped off big gains on the ground with Summers at quarterback totaling  yards rushing PERIOD

 Courtland Sutton is human after all East Carolina made a point to neutralize him and he had just four catches for  yards PERIOD Before a 22yard catch in garbage time his longest catch went for  yards PERIOD ECU did a great job taking away SMUs deep passing game PERIOD Pirates free safety Travon Simmons frequently provided help from his free safety spot and showed off his range PERIOD He also broke up a wouldbe Xavier Castille touchdown PERIOD

 SMUs offensive line regressed The line had made great progress so far this season but fell apart by giving up seven sacks in the second half PERIOD In SMUs first four games a lot of the sacks were coverage sacks sacks away from the tackle box or the result of Davis holding the ball for too long PERIOD But the line was beat a little more today and even struggled to contain four rushers on one sack PERIOD But worst of all it failed to create holes in the running game against a stout ECU front seven PERIOD SMU manage  rushing yards on  carries PERIOD That wont win games in Chad Morris power spread offense PERIOD
