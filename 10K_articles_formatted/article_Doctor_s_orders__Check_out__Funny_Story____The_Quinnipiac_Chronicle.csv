With all the workings and potential of being the perfect indie film of the year Its Kind of a Funny Story proves to be an actually hilarious story PERIOD Based on the  novel by Ned Vizzini Funny Story begs its viewers to realize were all a little crazy in the head  whether were clinically insane or just the regular kind PERIOD

If youve succumbed to the everpresent stresses of being a student family member friend or rejected lover you will easily relate to Craig Keir Gilchrist the 16yearold protagonist who voluntarily checks himself into an adult psychiatric hospital PERIOD

Funny Story is interspersed with a colorful array of characters  from a patient who never leaves his room to a victim of an LSD overdose which left him with highlysensitive hearing and the illusion that he is King Solomon PERIOD

The cast collectively delivers awkward sarcasm with precision and outstanding comedic timing PERIOD With leading performances by Zach Galifianakis Bobby Emma Roberts Noelle and Jeremy Davies Smitty Funny Story contains the type of witty giveandtake that is only achieved by superior actortoactor chemistry PERIOD

As Craig encounters schizophrenics and victims of severe selfinflicted injury a light and sarcastic mood is maintained thanks to Broken Social Scene the Canadian indierock band that formatted the score PERIOD With three tracks contributed by Broken Social Scene and various tracks by The Damned The Wowz and Ida Marie singing Oh My God for the movies official trailer the musical score leaves little to be desired PERIOD Its perfectly screwed up just like the film it pays tribute to PERIOD

While cataloguing the ups and downs of friend zones love triangles first loves everyday stresses and the temptations of suicide Funny Story manages to capture viewers hearts as well as their minds PERIOD You may leave the movie theater with a newfound acceptance of your own problems and fluctuating mental state PERIOD

Galifianakis leaves audiences with a piece of surprisingly cheery advice from such a negative suicidal character PERIOD You know what I would do just to be you for just a day I would  I dont know Id just live PERIOD Like it meant something. photo credit Focus Features
