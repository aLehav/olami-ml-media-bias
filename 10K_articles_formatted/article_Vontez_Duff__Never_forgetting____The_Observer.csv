Editors note This article originally ran in the Oct PERIOD   edition of The Observer PERIOD

Notre Dame cornerback Vontez Duff is like a human canvas.In all he has seven tattoos PERIOD But none are more important  or more visible  than the two he wears across his throat PERIOD On the left side is Wynoka the name of Duffs mother and the woman who raised four children virtually by herself PERIOD On the right side is Warren the name of Duffs father who passed away when Vontez was only two years old.I got my Dad in memory of him passing away Duff says of his most noticeable tattoos PERIOD But I had to get my mom as well because shed have been mad if I got him and not her.He says it with a laugh but the tattoos serve as both a tribute and a reminder PERIOD They pay respect to the father he barely had the chance to know and the mother who helped mold him into the person he is today.But they also serve as a reminder of the important things in his life and the obstacles hes had to overcome.RottweilerOn Duffs lower right arm is a tattoo of a rottweiler dog PERIOD He calls it his young and stupid tattoo  the first one he got and the characterization of an eager young man trying to break out onto the big scene.But there was really very little young and stupid about Duff at the time PERIOD As the oldest of four children Duff often served as surrogate dad to his two brothers and one sister while their mother worked PERIOD While others may have taken the circumstances as the freedom to find trouble Duff was busy making sure his siblings stayed out of trouble and on the right path.Being the oldest child of two brothers and a sister and with my mom working I was always the big brother in the house he said PERIOD I spent most of the time just watching after them making sure they were on top of everything and not getting in trouble.But Duff doesnt like to harp on what could have been or how things could have been better PERIOD He is thankful for the opportunities and the abilities he did have.Its like that sometimes and everybody has their story Duff said PERIOD You just try to make a positive out of every negative and be glad for the opportunities that you have ahead of you.Excelling on the fieldThose opportunities were many for the Duff a threesport star at Copperas Cove High School in Copperas Cove Texas PERIOD In fact in his younger days Duff first saw himself as a basketball standout.Growing up I thought I was going to be a basketball player Duff said I thought I was going to be like 6foot9 and the next Michael Jordan PERIOD But then it came to a point where I was playing football well and I knew thats what I had to be PERIOD So I was going to try to be the greatest football player that ever played.But off the field and court Duffs real love came on the track where he was a topclass long jumper and sprinter PERIOD In high school Duff recorded a .5second 100meter dash time and a long jump of  feet PERIOD The events really gave Duff a chance to show off his superb athletic ability.Track  I loved running track Duff remembers PERIOD It was just fun being out there with all the fellas running up and down the track and longjumping PERIOD I had a pretty good jumping career and our  x  meter team was pretty good  we went to state PERIOD But that was all fun and games to me although I knew in the back of my head that it helped me with my speed.In the long jump Duff was a major rival of Texas star wide receiver Roy Williams PERIOD The two squared off head to head in the event in many important meets.We competed in the long jump a few times in state and regionals Duff said PERIOD We both were jumping like  feet and everybody else was behind us PERIOD We were really the only guys that were competing for first place PERIOD He ended up beating me in state but I beat him at regionals before.From a runner to a hitterAt Notre Dame Duff met another minor challenge as thenhead coach Bob Davie asked the young star running back  who in his final two years of high school racked up  yards rushing and  touchdowns  to change positions and sides of the ball and become a cornerback in the thin Irish secondary.Duff accepted the challenge without a second thought.When Duff came in there was a real need for a corner said defensive line coach Greg Mattison who was defensive coordinator under Davie at the time Duff made the change PERIOD To show you the kind of man he is he was one of the most highly touted running backs in the state of Texas and he gladly made the switch PERIOD He just said Ill do anything to play and help the team. hes always been an unselfish football player and the kind of guy that wants to do something to help.Duff not only accepted the switch but he committed himself to becoming one of the best corners in the game PERIOD Duff worked diligently on learning the position and perfecting his technique.In just his first year with the Irish Duff saw significant playing time filling in for cornerback Shane Walton against Rutgers and corralled his first career interception in that game PERIOD He moved into the starting lineup in just the fourth game of his sophomore season PERIOD As a junior last season Duff started every game at cornerback for the Irish opposite the AllAmerican Walton.Duffs progress has been outstanding Mattison said PERIOD Thats his other strong point PERIOD Hes totally coachable PERIOD He comes in every day with a great attitude and an attitude to want to get better.But Duff has not forgotten his roots and how difficult it can be to come into college football and learn to play in such a new environment PERIOD Now as the experienced senior he takes time to coach the younger members of the Irish secondary who are breaking into the lineup.I sit with the young guys after practice and ask them how they played that day and what they could have done better Duff said PERIOD Every time we do oneonones I talk to the younger guys and coach them up on what they did wrong and what they did right PERIOD It just comes with being a senior you feel as though you have to do it PERIOD The younger guys will usually come to you anyway so you have to accept that role.Still a little kidWhile Duffs family situation may have forced him to mature a little before his time the senior cornerback is still just a kid at heart.Yeah it helped me grow up in some ways but I still love to be a little kid he says PERIOD I love playing the video games and just having that opportunity to just relax and have fun PERIOD I love being around my brothers and sister and just watching them grow up and things like that.Duffs funloving personality even carries over to the football field where he is often the one jumping around in the huddle like it was his first game on the field.When youre a coach you love to have players around you that have fun playing the game PERIOD And Duff really does  he has fun playing the game of football Mattison said PERIOD Vontez is more of a guy that when you look in the huddle hes always bouncing around PERIOD He always has a lot of energy and thats how he leads.Last season Duff was part of an Irish defensive backfield that made its presence known to its opponent every game PERIOD With Walton in the mix he and Duff went handinhand bouncing all over the field joking with each other talking to opposing players and generally just playing off each others success.With the graduation of Walton Duff has tried to carry over that excitement and love for the game to this years squad.Most definitely its my job to bring that attitude to the field this year Duff said PERIOD But it can be kind of different when guys dont have as much experience and theyre still learning the position a little bit PERIOD Its harder for them to get out there and run all over the place and yell and be excited because theyre still trying to learn what their role is and what their position is.Three more tattoosBack home in Copperas Cove Texas there are three pairs of eyes on big brother Vontez.They probably watch him every football Saturday as he bats down a pass or returns a kickoff  yards for a touchdown PERIOD But they also watch him all the time dayin and dayout just as he watched them so many days when their mother was working to support them.Even though they may not like to admit it Duff knows they look up to their big brother.They try not to show it  especially my brothers they dont want to show it PERIOD But when you go home they love seeing you he says PERIOD They want to wear your Notre Dame gear and your shoes and everything else you own and they want to be just like you PERIOD You know they try to hide it on the outside but you know its there.Maybe those three have a tattoo to get too someday.How about the same one Duff has on his stomach  Vontez. share This Story
