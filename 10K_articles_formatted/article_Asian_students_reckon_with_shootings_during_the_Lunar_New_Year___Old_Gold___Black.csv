Eli Leadham Contributing WriterFebruary  

On Jan PERIOD  seven people were shot and killed and one was critically injured in Half Moon Bay Calif PERIOD Just two days before on Jan PERIOD   people were killed and nine were critically injured in a shooting at Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park Calif PERIOD All but one of the victims were Asian Americans PERIOD

The timing of the attacks coincided with celebration of the Lunar New Year which began Jan PERIOD  PERIOD Celebrations typically continue for two weeks and are typically joyful this year however they are stained by the bloodshed PERIOD

Initially I was desensitized junior Annie Phan said PERIOD At some point the hundreds of articles in the papers with similar tragic headlines began to feel normal. violence against Asian communities has increased with the COVID19 pandemic according to PBS PERIOD And though definitions for mass shootings vary there have been almost  of them in January alone according to a New York Times report  which leaves Asian American students to grapple with both the grief of losing members of their communities and the communal joy that often surrounds this time of year PERIOD

The Asian Student Interest Association ASIA plans to host an event Feb PERIOD  to celebrate the Lunar New Year anew PERIOD

The event will give everyone a space to see what we have to offer and create connections with the wider community Phan said PERIOD And to make sure that the traditions that weve upheld for thousands of years remain strong PERIOD Everyone who has lived and everyone who has died will be honored through our celebrations and continuations of their legacies. in the meantime Phan who currently serves as president of ASIA came to realize that she was not desensitized to the shootings  she was simply coping PERIOD

I realized that I was not in fact desensitized because the next thing I knew I was lying on my carpet floor for hours just sad and heartbroken Phan said PERIOD The thing that slapped me in the face the most was remembering that on Sunday  people had plans  festivals to attend red envelopes to receive their favorite cousin to catch up with PERIOD They had bnh tt to steam and firecrackers to pop PERIOD They made promises of tomorrow to their friends and family only to have that stripped away from them and their entire community. the Monterey Park shooting was horrifying initially PERIOD And it became even more personal when my aunt told me that my grandparents used to frequent Monterey Park  so I have had to distance myself from the news to protect my mental health PERIOD

The Monterey Park shooting was especially unsettling because the city has a current majority Asian American population according to a New York Times report PERIOD

The Monterey Park shooting was horrifying initially freshman Alyssa Cheng said PERIOD And it became even more personal when my aunt told me that my grandparents used to frequent Monterey Park  so I have had to distance myself from the news to protect my mental health. the Lunar New Year is a special time of the year for many Asian American communities making the recent shootings that much more difficult to process PERIOD

The Lunar New Year is a time to spend with loved ones to celebrate new beginnings and to bring in the new year with good luck junior and Vice President of ASIA Katie Zheng said PERIOD

Because of the recent violence however some students changed their plans PERIOD

I celebrated Lunar New Year with friends indoors for my safety and others safety said freshman Owen Jun an international student from South Korea PERIOD The news about the Monterey Park shooting made me feel like I shouldnt be in any gatherings held outside during holidays. it is almost impossible not to feel a sense of disdain at the thought of celebrating amidst such tragic events but students like Phan  who is planning to celebrate bigger and better  are not letting anything dampen their joy PERIOD

For students seeking support Wake Forests student organizations such as ASIA the Hindu Student Association and the Asian American Identity Group offer resources to connect students PERIOD

We hope that our events and also the events of many other groups like the Intercultural Center Asian American Identity Group and more create this community during Lunar New Year Zheng said PERIOD

Eli is a freshman from Portland Ore PERIOD They plan on double majoring in history and english with a tentative minor in computer science PERIOD Outside of the OGB.. PERIOD
