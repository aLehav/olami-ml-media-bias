The Office of Civic Engagement and Volunteerism has partnered with the Salvation Army to provide a free lunch to anyone  years old and younger during the summer PERIOD

Director Beth Gillespie said the end of the school year brings the end of schoolprovided meals during the day and for many families in Coles County it also brings the added stress of providing more meals throughout the week PERIOD

Gillespie said during the school year parents and guardians are responsible for  meals per week and the addition of  weekly meals in the summer can be a large burden for many to bear which is where the summer meals program steps in PERIOD

There are high levels of food insecurity and poverty in Coles County and the program is one thing the office can do to help address that need right in the community she said PERIOD

The program began on Monday and it ends on Aug PERIOD  of this year PERIOD

Assistant director Crystal Brown said it will be offered every week Monday through Thursday with the exception of July  PERIOD

There are no income conditions and anyone within the age requirement is welcome to come have a meal Brown said PERIOD

Gillespie said one change to the program this year is that the office has partnered with the local schools and will be set up onsite with lunches for children to have a meal after they finish their day at summer school PERIOD

This is an important step in outreach as the students will already be at the school and will not need to worry about finding a ride or getting to and from a lunch site she said PERIOD

The program offers services at four different locations this year Gillespie said PERIOD

Meals will be served at Neco Fields from  a.m PERIOD to  a.m. at Long Acres from  a.m PERIOD to  a.m. at Carl Sandburg Elementary School from noon to  p.m PERIOD and at Textbook Rental from  p.m PERIOD to  p.m. she said PERIOD Free meals at Carl Sandburg Elementary will only be provided during the month of June PERIOD

Brown said participants do not need to sign up or make arrangements in advance however meals must be eaten onsite PERIOD

Gillespie said the program provided over a thousand lunches last summer and the office expects an increase in that number this year with the continuing need and new addition of the school site PERIOD

Hunger affects every aspect of daily life she said if children are going through the day hungry it can be difficult for them to focus on any task at hand PERIOD

A lot of people when they wake up in the morning dont know if they are going to have access to enough food for three balanced meals a day Gillespie said PERIOD

The program is necessary because it is important for students to have meals that are nutritionally adequate and can provide fuel for their bodies she said PERIOD

Brown said the offices principal purpose is catering to local families facing hunger and poverty problems and doing anything within its power to help the community with those issues PERIOD

Gillespie said the intent of the summer meals program and everything done within the office is to help students recognize not only that they have the power to make a difference in their community but that it is their responsibility to PERIOD

She said she encourages her students to look outside of their normal circle pay attention to real problems happening in their community and take action to fix those problems PERIOD

Food insecurity is an easy problem to see an easy problem to understand and is therefore an easy problem to do something about Gillespie said PERIOD
