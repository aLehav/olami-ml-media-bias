Its official Words With Friends has taken over my life PERIOD

This is highly inconvenient considering how much I still have to get done before break PERIOD

Its gotten so bad that I actually considered deleting the app from my phone but I didnt PERIOD Instead I settled for turning off the feature that allows me to receive notifications every single time someone makes a move in any of the  games Im currently involved in PERIOD That didnt last long either PERIOD I swear Im starting to see those little yellow tiles in my sleep PERIOD

Theres nothing quite like the feeling you get after placing your tiles on the board just right so that they hit a triple letter score and a triple word score at the same time PERIOD And if you happen to be lucky or skilled enough to put a Q a Z or a J on that triple letter score look out PERIOD

WWF has also completely changed and revamped my vocabulary  probably not in a good way PERIOD I can now successfully use qi xi za ai jo and a plethora of other twoletter words no ones ever heard of to bail myself out when I have no other options PERIOD Never mind that I have no idea what those words mean PERIOD

The problem with WWF however is that being an English major gives me no advantage whatsoever PERIOD Everyone is on equal footing PERIOD Theres no penalty for playing invalid words so someone can conceivably sit there and try hundreds of different ludicrous letter combinations before finally striking gold with an 83point winner PERIOD

In a recent matchup against my 17yearold cousin he managed to throw together the words clew and taj to beat me by four points PERIOD Miffed I looked them up to double check the validity only to find that a clew in fact is the lower part of a sail and a taj is a tall conical cap worn by Muslims PERIOD

Id be willing to bet he had no idea what a clew or a taj was until he started throwing random letters around the vicinity of that triple word score PERIOD

I thought I had made peace with that until just now actually because my Word document just reopened the case by stigmatizing taj with the telltale red underline PERIOD WWF simply doesnt play by the rules PERIOD

But I really cant complain Ive started using some pretty ridiculous letter combinations myself PERIOD Its at the point where I actually get mad at the game when it doesnt accept the absurd words I try to come up with PERIOD

If you have the urge to try out weeno dolla or garhat dont waste your time PERIOD Ive already tried PERIOD And failed PERIOD

Mark my words WWF is going to either revolutionize or destroy the Scrabble industry PERIOD No one who has ever played WWF will be able to pick up a traditional Scrabble board and play it the same way ever again PERIOD At least I know I wont be able to PERIOD Scrabble might not even be around for much longer PERIOD

Years from now youre going to see the guys on American Pickers unearthing Scrabble boards from the wreckage of some old guys garage and paying him hundreds of dollars for it PERIOD Theyre going to become collectors items  the stuff of legends PERIOD

You think that sounds bad Dont even get me started on Hanging With Friends PERIOD
