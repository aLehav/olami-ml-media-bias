A controversial allocation of council funding in North Quad Residence Hall has led to a reduction of the allotment and the passage of a prevention measure in a separate residence hall to ensure a similar circumstance doesnt arise there in the future PERIOD

Following criticism that money was unethically allocated for a service trip to Peru for a few North Quad residents the North Quad Multicultural Council voted on Sunday to reduce the amount of funding appropriated for the trip by  PERIOD

The council came under scrutiny after it approved  dollars in funding for the trip during a meeting on Sunday March  PERIOD The decision to reduce funding for the trip was made after seven residents dropped out of the program PERIOD Two of the residents held executive board positions on the council PERIOD

In response to the situation the Stockwell Second Year Experience programming board passed an amendment last night to restrict future funding to only programs that affect a vast majority of residents PERIOD

LSA junior Andrew Schantz chair of finance for the Multicultural Council said the service trip had been a priority for the council since the beginning of the year because of North Quads international focus PERIOD Schantz added that the money wasnt appropriated to fund a vacation for students but instead to fund a servicebased trip that would allow participating residents to share their experiences with students upon their return PERIOD

Its not like were using this money frivolously  he said PERIOD The day that they hit the ground in Peru theyre going to be doing service work at elementary schools at Cusco PERIOD So its not like this is going to be relaxing and leisurely time for anybody PERIOD Its going to be a lot of hard work. due to the reduction in participants and additional funding from the Michigan Student Assembly Residence Halls Association and the Ginsberg Center the Committee for International Impact  a subcommittee of the North Quad Multicultural Council  offered to return some of the funding they had initially requested from the council Schantz said PERIOD

The council also faced criticism for voting on the allocation of funds since several of the council members were originally going to go on the trip PERIOD However the executive board members and representatives of the Multicultural Council who are participating in the service trip decided it was ethical to vote on the proposal to grant funding for the trip after discussing it with Hall Director Laura Johnson Schantz said PERIOD

We felt that since the participants on the trip are residents in the residence hall and we pay the same amount of money towards the general fund that goes towards the budget  they had every right to do so Schantz said PERIOD It seemed unfair to take their vote away from them if they are under the same conditions PERIOD They paid those dues like everybody else. lSA sophomore Lauren Mullins cochair of International Impact will no longer be participating in the service trip PERIOD She wrote in an email interview that before voting on funding for the trip a vote was held to decide whether those participating could vote PERIOD

This service trip is meant to develop and advance North Quads theme community of International Impact so in my mind allocating funding for this trip is benefiting more than just the residents participating it is contributing to the residence hall as a whole and promoting their mission of affecting change on a global issue she wrote PERIOD

Because of the incident in North Quad members of the Stockwell Second Year Experience board voted in favor of a resolution that would look to fund programs and events which will positively affect a large number of its residents. brendan Devlin secretary of the Stockwell Second Year Experience programming board said the amendment is similar to a policy RHA already has in place PERIOD

David Guenther executive chair of the programming board at Stockwell said the board wanted to ensure a trip similar to that of North Quad wouldnt be funded in their hall PERIOD

I think that at least at the RHA meeting the representatives seemed to lose focus on what their roles are Guenther said PERIOD Its not to do what you think is right its to do what you think the residents want. university Housing spokesman Peter Logan declined to comment on the Stockwell programming boards amendment until he receives more information on the proposal PERIOD

Though it isnt likely to be enacted in other halls Guenther said he hopes Stockwells amendment encourages other representatives to adhere to the funding policies PERIOD

We hoped that this would encourage restrictions on how money is spent and the executive board has a large influence on what happens which they should but I feel like there should be more regulation on how money is distributed Guenther said PERIOD

LSA junior James Prendergast a North Quad resident said though hall councils have a right to use their funding as they see fit allowing trip participants to vote was unethical PERIOD

I think it comes under the realm of corruption when youre allowed to vote on funding for yourself he said PERIOD

He added that he thinks funding should be cut even more since residents money is going to be used to fund a trip for only a few people PERIOD

I think that only reducing it by  is a slap in the face he said PERIOD

LSA sophomore Molly Spalding a resident of North Quad and a trip participant said she doesnt understand why there were problems with funding the trip as it had been a wellknown goal to fund the travels during the year PERIOD

Since our theme is International Impact the whole goal was to fund or partially fund an international service trip she said PERIOD I think everyone was aware of that throughout the year. younJoo Sang contributed to this report PERIOD
