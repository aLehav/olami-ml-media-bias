HBO Maxs Doom Patrol returns after the harrowing cliffhanger of season  which left the Patrol coated in deadly candle wax PERIOD Picking up directly after season  throws the heroes through a slew of bizarre adventures ranging from zombie attacks to encounters with eccentric time travelers PERIOD Cliff Steele Brendan Fraser Jane Diane Guerrero Larry Trainor Matt Bomer and Rita Farr April Bowlby return with their usual wild antics taking the Patrols adventures into uncharted territory PERIOD

Doom Patrol particularly excels when it utilizes its variety of subgenres PERIOD Using the endless sandbox of DC Comics characters and worlds the show introduces refreshing scenarios incorporating horror science fiction and even musical elements PERIOD The first few episodes of season  introduce the Dead Boy Detectives a duo of ghostly teens who investigate cases involving the supernatural PERIOD Their storyline drives the show into exciting horror corners introducing terrifying new characters and settings PERIOD One particular moment involving a spiderlike woman will stick with audiences long after the episode airs PERIOD

At its core Doom Patrol has an immense heart PERIOD While the characters in the patrol have eccentric personalities that differ immensely they rely on each other in times of need PERIOD One perfectly timed musical dance number oozes with emotion visually representing the bond these characters have PERIOD The shows signature oddball comedy manifests throughout every episode adding fun to even the darkest moments PERIOD

While all of the previous seasons strengths are present this time around so are its faults PERIOD Many of the leading characters arcs seem to go in circles retreading on storylines explored to death in previous seasons PERIOD Steele continues to struggle with his robotic body Cyborg Joivan Wade continues to butt heads with his father and Trainor struggles to connect more with his spirit companion PERIOD While not boring to watch the constant backtracking can feel frustrating PERIOD

The pilot episode of season  almost seems like a strange cut finale of the previous season PERIOD It wraps up the season  cliffhanger with an almost shocking amount of ease deflating the weight of the previous storylines events PERIOD The use of Niles Caulder Timothy Dalton feels similar to his presence in season  PERIOD COVID19 protocols obviously limited the actors and therefore characters ability to interact with the main cast PERIOD Luckily once the remnants of season  are dealt with season 3s refreshing and exciting storylines reenergize the narrative PERIOD
