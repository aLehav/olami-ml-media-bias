4103,2017-12-07,"as December begins and the quarter comes to an end here at the Nexus we want to reflect on  PERIOD While most of it may have seemed like a cruel joke or a nonsensical dream one thing that can always be relied upon to seem right in the world is food PERIOD
On The Menu went back in time through the depths of Pinterest Instagram Google search results and hipster food blogs to reveal the biggest food trends by month in  PERIOD In case you missed the hype or want to reflect on your culinary decisions here is a compiled list of the most popular foods of the past year PERIOD

December 
Okay I know I just said that this list was trends of  but lets face it A lot of rapid change happened after the November  election and with that being said I feel like our journey begins here with empanadas PERIOD The delicious savory pastry pockets come in a variety of flavors making them adaptable to many different culinary backgrounds PERIOD Plenty of places have taken on the grabandgo simplicity of these Latin treats and applied their own artisanal spin on them PERIOD Locally you can pick some up at Tangonadas downtown PERIOD

January  
For anyone with any sort of appreciation of Vietnamese cuisine you may be saying what the pho to this next pick PERIOD But for those unaware this noodle dish and its aromatic broth blew up in a big way at the beginning of this year PERIOD Although it was an already trendy meal there was an explosion of social media posts about athome adaptations of the traditional dish in that first cold month of  PERIOD You can get your pho on at Saigon Noodle House near Kmart or in your backyard at Pho Bistro PERIOD

February  
Matcha is one of those things that I have been intimidated by PERIOD Hearing those perfectly puttogether sorority girls order their matcha lattes while I grunt out an order for black iced coffee in my sweatpants and last nights leftover eyeliner has made me as bitter as my drink PERIOD But matcha became a staple in coffee and tea houses this year PERIOD Not only is it super good for you but its an aesthetically pleasing pale green PERIOD Pick up a matcha green tea latte at Caje to make you feel better about yourself for finals week PERIOD

March 
Just a walk down the snack aisle at TJs will tell you that veggie chips are in PERIOD If it grew from the earth and is remotely considered vegan then by God the manufacturers are going to thinly slice fry and salt it so they can throw it in some packaging and tell you its a chip PERIOD And this year we ate it up literally PERIOD Those alternative chips flew off the shelves with their peak season in March PERIOD Might I suggest a bag of the classic Inner Peas They may be contested as a true to form chip but lets be honest if it isnt a potato is it really a chip

April  
This year I think we were all desperate for a little escape from reality and maybe thats why we made everything look like a fucking unicorn PERIOD From lattes to cupcakes to god damn cream cheese on toast and popcorn PERIOD We slapped pastel pinks purples blues and edible glitter on anything that couldnt run fast enough PERIOD While I appreciate the creativity Im not an advocate of consuming fictional beings and hope this trend stays in  PERIOD If you need one last magical meal try the unicorn hot chocolate recipe from cookiesandcups.com

May 
Isla Vista may have jumped on the band wagon late with this one by just opening up two poke restaurants in the last few months but that is simply a testament to the popularity of the raw fish bowls PERIOD It seems as if this trend is here to stay and has already formed its own cult following and fusion adaptations PERIOD Youll be seeing an exponential growth of the poke scene PERIOD Try out our two new Isla Vista poke stops at Poke Ceviche and PokiRito PERIOD

June  
Although tacos have stood the test of time and will likely always be popular especially in our beautiful state of California there has been a taco takeover in the culinary world so to speak PERIOD It seems that one positive thing from this past election has been a need for awareness and a sense of unity amongst cultures and groups targeted by the executive branch PERIOD A Mexican classic that allows for variation and adaptations the taco has become a staple in restaurants as humble as mom and pops to fivestar culinary legends PERIOD To feel united with our cousins south of the border try the famous Lilys Tacos in the Kmart plaza open every day except Tuesday PERIOD

July 
This trend was one that I seemed to have missed entirely although Pinterest sure didnt PERIOD In case you were looking for an alternative barbecuing option then jackfruit is your guy PERIOD Used as a substitute for pulled pork and other piggy plates the hearty fruit definitely raises some eyebrows PERIOD Try this recipe for Kentuckyfried jackfruit from theveglife.com

August 
For years the green on the scene was kale but thats old news now PERIOD Many veg heads have opted for more aromatic and interesting greens PERIOD Those like mustard greens arugula watercress chard and curly endive have hypnotized the masses with their nutritional benefits PERIOD Anything from green smoothies to salads the health gods have spoken and kale just simply isnt enough PERIOD Try Mesa Verdes strawberry asparagus salad for your next dinner PERIOD

September  
Yes I know avocado has consistently been a trend since idk the early 2000s Yet here we are just as mesmerized as ever by this creamy green fruit PERIOD The California Avocado Festival which happens at the end of September or early October doesnt help us calm down much either and so all month our Instagram feeds are filled with avocado roses guacamole done  different ways and of course every variation of avocado toast that has ever been thought of PERIOD Ever PERIOD So go ahead get the guac even though you know its extra at least youre on trend PERIOD
