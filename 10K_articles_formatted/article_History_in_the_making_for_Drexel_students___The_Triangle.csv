9459,2012-02-17,"ten years ago a Drexel Athletics staff member named Sean Joyce had a dream PERIOD Although people continuously told him his idea had no chance and that many had failed to accomplish the same feat many times before Joyce did not back down PERIOD

Despite many drawbacks an extremely small group of members and faulty first attempts at naming the club the group of students was eventually named the DAC Pack a play on the name of the athletic center that the Drexel basketball teams call home PERIOD

Fastforward  years to the present day and this group of students which is much larger than the  that originated the club at its beginning is a staple of athletic spirit on the Drexel campus PERIOD On any given day a student can walk around campus and find a few small groups of students wearing Year of the Dragon DAC Pack Tshirts while handing out free tickets to the next home game PERIOD

Students with a valid Drexel student ID can gain admission to any Drexel athletic event for free and in most cases even receive a free DAC Pack shirt eventually flooding the gym in a sea of screaming yellowclad fans PERIOD

In a recent column by Philadelphia Daily News columnist Dick Jerardi titled When Fans Get Nasty Jerardi listed of a number of interesting facts and opinions some good and some controversial PERIOD

One statement he did make  and this is of particular importance to Drexel  is as follows

In this city the best fan section has to be Drexel PERIOD Others have more participants PERIOD None is as enthusiastic as the DAC Pack PERIOD It is loud and creative with fun being the operative word PERIOD And the DAC Pack has a really good team to watch. now that is saying something in a city known for the Big  not the City   Drexel is only included in the latter with the Big  made up of Temple University Villanova University La Salle University St PERIOD Josephs University and the University of Pennsylvania PERIOD

The Drexel mens basketball team has been having a large amount of success this season and one could say that the DAC Pack is reaping the benefits as well but hey this is college basketball and everyone just wants to have fun PERIOD

Seeing an opportunity to gain some national exposure Joyce the DAC Packs faculty adviser was able to send in an application to a contest that could earn the student organization  and the University  just that PERIOD

Its called the Naismith Student Section of the Year Award and they had this website you can go on enter your email address and then just vote for Drexel DAC Pack President Anthony DAngelo said PERIOD You can do it once a day through your email address and we just kind of started a little campaign getting the word out there with social media and otherwise just getting people to vote for the DAC Pack and people took to it. joyce added that the entire idea started when this competition sent them an application PERIOD Drexel and hundreds of other schools sent in their applications and a panel of eight judges picked the top  schools for the competition  Drexel being one of them PERIOD

With the competition going on for more than a few weeks now Drexel is still alive PERIOD In fact they are more than alive as they have cracked the Sweet  of the competition reaching as high as No PERIOD  at some points in the voting PERIOD

Drexel is also the only midmajor school left in a competition that is filled with Division I heavyweights PERIOD

There is a date in the minds of everyone even remotely involved with the DAC Pack and that is Feb PERIOD  PERIOD That is the date when the Naismith panel releases the schools that have made it to the final eight PERIOD Once that happens students and their votes matter no longer PERIOD The winner will be chosen by the panel out of the final eight PERIOD

The other  schools that make up the Sweet  are the University of Kansas Purdue University Gonzaga University San Diego State University Utah State University Indiana University Duke University Syracuse University West Virginia University the University of Kentucky the University of Illinois the University of California the University of Pittsburgh the University of Colorado and the University of Arizona PERIOD

Its pretty cool to see Drexel up there PERIOD Whether its with Arizona State or Indiana or North Carolina or Gonzaga its pretty cool to see the schools name up there Joyce said PERIOD It also just helps to go along with the season the mens team is having which makes it even more fun. joyce also mentioned that the students are getting really hyped up and into this whole competition and of course DAngelo is no exception PERIOD

Its a tremendous honor to get a little recognition for the work we do  to get people out to games to create the type of fun atmosphere we think that Drexel athletics is all about PERIOD  Itd be great to have the rest of the country know about us DAngelo said PERIOD Weve already been labeled the best student section in Philly by a number of sources and that means a lot too since Philadelphia basketball is huge among the NCAA PERIOD But to get on a national level would be that much better PERIOD

Plus Naismith just sounds really cool since they do all of the college basketball awards  it just makes it seem really official. as the DAC Pack and Joyce prepare for the long haul that is the Naismith competition heres a word of advice for the Drexel basketball faithful out there PERIOD

Even if you are not a diehard fan like DAngelo and the rest of his crew that doesnt mean you cant go out and enjoy this Dragon mania that is sweeping the campus PERIOD So you came to Drexel and accepted the fact that sports arent a very big part of the culture  well guess what You have a chance to enjoy a onceinalifetime opportunity that Joyce and the DAC Pack are running with PERIOD

Oh yeah and the basketball team is pretty good too PERIOD

The men are currently one of the hottest teams in the nation as they are on a 14game win streak and have won  of their last  games PERIOD At  overall and  in the conference the Colonial Athletic Associations firstplace Dragons are prepping for their ESPN BracketBusters game against the Cleveland State University Vikings Feb PERIOD  PERIOD They will finish up the season against James Madison University at home Feb PERIOD  and then on the road against Old Dominion University Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

In the words of the great Dick Vitale This is awesome baby",History in the making for Drexel students - The Triangle,Drexel University
