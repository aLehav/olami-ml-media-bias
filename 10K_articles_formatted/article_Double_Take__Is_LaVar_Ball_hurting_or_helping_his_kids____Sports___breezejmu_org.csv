LaVar Ball the father of UCLAs Lonzo Ball has been making headlines for his comments on his children PERIOD Two staff writers debate whether or not his comments are hurting or helping his kids PERIOD

LaVars comments are building the familys brand

Jack Fitzpatrick  The Breeze

UCLAs success this season behind freshman guard sensation Lonzo Ball has sparked his dad LaVar Ball to make outlandish comments about his family PERIOD

LaVar has been making his sport talk show rounds recently and has started to make comments not only about his three kids all of whom are verbally committed or playing for UCLA but also other professional athletes and their kids PERIOD LaVar stated about LeBron James son LeBron James Jr PERIOD 

That comment then spurred James to address LaVar specifically PERIOD Keep my family out of your mouth James said PERIOD This is dad to dad PERIOD Its a problem now. comments like this as well as saying his sons are worth a billiondollar shoe deal arent hurting the kids like some believe PERIOD These kids have grown up with him as their father  theyre used to his comments and him being around PERIOD

If anything the remarks have helped the kids PERIOD Lonzo has led his team to the Sweet  in the NCAA tournament while averaging  percent shooting from the field and  points a game PERIOD Another one of the sons LaMelo Ball scored  in one of his games and the final brother LiAngelo Ball has scored  once this season at their high school PERIOD

These kids are special talents and they know that and their father knows that PERIOD Hes just stating his mind about his kids PERIOD He isnt hurting his kids at all but rather building them up and showing confidence in them PERIOD Hes a father that has given them everything they wanted when it came to the game of basketball PERIOD

LaVar is just getting his kids the spotlight he feels they deserve PERIOD Granted their talent does speak for itself but as a high school sophomore LaMelo is getting ESPN coverage pretty consistently and the last person to have that type of coverage was King James himself PERIOD Coverage that wouldnt be as consistent if he didnt have a father like LaVar PERIOD

The Ball kids would have some media attention and would have some hype around them but now with the dad becoming involved its bringing more attention and giving them more of the spotlight PERIOD Which is exactly what LaVar has trained them for their whole life PERIOD

Yes LaVar is bringing a lot attention to his family but at the same time right now this is an article on LaVar and what he is doing PERIOD Hes been the one on every talk show and hes been the one getting the spotlight on his kids PERIOD Lonzo is going out and practicing preparing for UCLAs next game PERIOD LaVar is the one in the media talking about his kids PERIOD The kids are continuing to develop their games while Lavar helps build the familys brand PERIOD

LaVar needs to stop talking

Harry Holtzclaw  The Breeze

Weve all seen that parent at sporting events who thinks their son is the greatest player alive PERIOD The nonstop chanting bragging and nonsense that comes out of that parents mouth is annoying and often goes to the childs head PERIOD This parent is LaVar Ball PERIOD Ever since his first son Lonzo started showing the college basketball world how good he really is LaVar has been receiving more national attention than his son PERIOD

It started with a couple comments from Lavar stating he thinks Lonzo can be better than Michael Jordan and that he will be the first homegrown player to play for the Lakers PERIOD Initially these comments were criticized but I saw no problem with a dad thinking that his son can become the best and be on his favorite team while doing it PERIOD I backed up Ball saying that he was Lonzos dad and that he could say these things because he simply thinks the highest of his son PERIOD But the comments ridiculousness has escalated to a point that its no longer benefitting his kid PERIOD

Since those comments LaVar has been adamant about his own ability to beat Jordan oneonone if he was in his heyday. he then sent a message to NBA stars Stephen Curry and LeBron James PERIOD He stated that if Curry and Lonzo switched places the Warriors would be better off and UCLA wouldnt be where they are today PERIOD He also claimed that Jamess kids wont grow up to amount to the Ballss successes because they have too big of shoes to fill PERIOD All three of these comments are ridiculous in their own ways PERIOD This isnt going to hurt Lonzos draft stock as he will be drafted first or second round regardless but his reputation going into the league may already be blemished PERIOD This could call for harder fouls on him and cause grudges to develop between him and other players before he even gets into the league PERIOD

The Jordan comment was where I drew the line PERIOD Comparing your son to Jordan is one thing but the fact that LaVar turned the attention to himself and not his son isnt the message he should be sending not to mention Jordan could spot Ball  points and still beat him to  PERIOD He later said the same thing about Charles Barkley stating that hes never lost a game of oneonone PERIOD Hes already been a guest on ESPNs First Take and argued with Stephen A PERIOD Smith about his oneonone ability and his chances of beating the NBA greats in this style of game PERIOD LaVar taking the spotlight from his son is the issue PERIOD

Hopefully LaVar quiets down because many of his predictions wont come true and people will be turning their heads to him and looking for answers PERIOD If you Google Lonzo Ball the first story that pops up isnt about Lonzos smooth yet lavish basketball style its about his dads comments PERIOD Ball do us all  and yourself  a favor and shut up PERIOD
