5957,2023-07-11,"in Dallas Buyers Club Matthew McConaughey plays a racist homophobic electrician named Ron Woodroof PERIOD The film directed by JeanMarc Vallee almost goes out of its way to avoid becoming what it easily could have been a sentimental and heartfelt tale of one bigot learning to accept others  and probably finding love in the process PERIOD In forsaking the obvious route Dallas Buyers Club manages to craft a downtoearth and inspiring storyof survival PERIOD

Woodroof is based on the reallife activist of the same name who was diagnosed with AIDS in  a time when the disease was still widely considered to only be a threat to homosexuals PERIOD When Woodroof is diagnosed he is shocked PERIOD But after taking stock of his deteriorating body  McConaughey reportedly lost  pounds for the role  he tries to get his hands on the AZT drug which was untested at the time PERIOD Woodroof is told he has  days to live PERIOD Waiting six months for the first round of human trials to be approved by the FDA isnt an option PERIOD He starts stealing the drug  nearly dying due to the drugs destructive effects on his already frail immune system  and later finds a doctor in Mexico who will sell him a pharmaceutical cocktail of supplements and medicines that is not available in the U.S PERIOD

Always looking to make money Woodroof starts importing the drugs from Mexico and Japan and selling them to AIDS patients in Dallas PERIOD With the assistance of Rayon Jared Leto a drag queen and fellow patient Woodroof opens the Dallas Buyers Club  a membership based supply of AIDS symptomfighting drugs that cannot be obtained anywhere else PERIOD Most of the clubs members are gay and the film benefits from never letting itself forget that Woodroofs actions are based on selfinterest PERIOD He does become an activist but only out of the need to raise support for his efforts in the face of increasing attention from the federal government PERIOD Woodroof grows more accepting of his clientele and the slow dissipation of prejudice is more believable because it is inspired by the primal need to survive PERIOD

McConaughey and Leto deliver outstanding performances PERIOD There is more at play than the physical transformations the actors took on for their roles PERIOD Woodroof is gruff sarcastic and volatile for most of the movie but theres an unmistakable charisma there PERIOD He is clever and its easy to see why people are drawn to him despite his dour exterior PERIOD Rayon
meanwhile makes for the most unlikely partnerincrime Woodroof could have asked for PERIOD Leto is
heartbreaking and hilarious often at the same time PERIOD

Dallas Buyers Club succeeds because it doesnt attempt to sensationalize an unsentimental issue PERIOD At times it feels like the businessmans response to Rent. while that classic musical depicted AIDS as a failed suppressor to vibrant energy of life Dallas Buyers Club shows how the disease organized those who werent ready to see their lives end PERIOD Woodroof began by looking out for himself and inadvertently became an unlikely champion for AIDS victims PERIOD He probably never imagined such a thing happening but he played the hand he was dealt PERIOD

Official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",“Dallas Buyers Club” offers an unsentimental look at AIDS – The Daily Texan,University of Texas Austin
