Ken Gottlieb is getting bullied around in Florida legislature PERIOD

Gottlieb a state representative from Hollywood has been trying for the past six years to get support for his antibullying bill which calls for a ban on the harassment of students based on specific factors such as race ethnicity or sexual orientation PERIOD

It has never come close to being passed and this year should be no different according to Bully Police USA founder Brenda High who said Ive monitored these bills around the country for years and the ones with victim definitions really struggle to get passed. but in this case or any other victim definitions is really just one victim definition sexual orientation PERIOD There is no problem with protecting Jews blacks or anyone else who faces constant ridicule PERIOD But gays apparently are fair game PERIOD Leave it to elected lawmakers to shiver in their boots like their lunch money is about to get taken by the big bad constituent bully when confronted with the issue of protecting gays PERIOD

A shame then that Rep PERIOD Ellen Bogdanoffs competing antibullying bill whichsurprise surprisedoes not specifically categorize the groups to which bullying is so common is likely to pass in the same legislative session PERIOD Bogdanoff was one of the many lawmakers to vote down Gottliebs bill last year PERIOD Certainly the fact that her bill has a good chance to become a law is a good thing bullying is a serious issue that can carry longterm effects for those picked on or worse lead to fullscale violent retribution PERIOD But why are we remiss when factoring likelihood of passing into our support or opposition to a bill It seems presumptuous of Brenda High to support Bogdanoffs law and not Gottliebs simply because it has a higher likelihood of passing PERIOD Isnt it odd for someone to not support all antibullying laws when she is apparently SO antibullying that she founded a group to prevent it

The real fear is what could potentially be a result A student harassed based on his or her sexual orientation not being protected by state law simply out of a laws vagueness PERIOD

Its a scary situationmore so than being cornered by a bully PERIOD

The Miami Hurricane is the student newspaper of the University of Miami in Coral Gables Florida PERIOD The newspaper is edited and produced by undergraduate students at UM and is published in print every Tuesday and online everyday during the academic year PERIOD",Vagueness takes the lunch money out of bullying bills - The Miami Hurricane,University of Miami
