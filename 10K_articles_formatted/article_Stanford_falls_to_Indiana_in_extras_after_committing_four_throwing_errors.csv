5350,2015-02-14,"punished by four uncharacteristic throwing errors at the most inopportune times Stanford  dropped its second straight game to start the season on Saturday falling  to Indiana  in  innings PERIOD

The score was knotted at two heading into extras but Stanford freshman twoway player Quinn Brodey unraveled in the tenth inning  and it had nothing to do with his pitching PERIOD

After starting the game as a designated hitter in the sevenspot of the Cardinal lineup Brodey later came on in relief of sophomore Brett Hanewich who after throwing two scoreless innings had allowed the potential goahead run to reach second base PERIOD Brodey showed poise withhis back against the wall in his first collegiate outing enteringthe game in the middle of an atbatand inducingthe final two outs of the inning a lineout to right and a groundout to third PERIOD

But in the tophalf of the tenth things went downhill after Brodey allowed a leadoff walk to Hoosier fifthyear senior Will Nolden  PERIOD

Indiana senior Brad Hartong hitting third in the order then dropped down a sacrifice bunt trying to advance the winning run into scoring position PERIOD Brodey fielded the ball but his throw over to first sailed over the first basemans head and into foul territory PERIOD

Indianas next hitter Scott Donley attempted another sacrifice the ball again fielded by Brodey PERIOD But his throw over to first missed even higher than the first one did Nolden came around to score and Hartong advanced to third on the error PERIOD

Theres nothing you can say PERIOD Its just two bad plays said head coach Mark Marquess PERIOD But hell get over it it wont bother him PERIOD Itll bother him now but itll be alright. the Hoosiers went on to score another unearned run later in the inning  three out of their four total on Saturday were of the unearned variety  and eventually survived a scare from the Cardinal in the bottomhalf of the tenth PERIOD

Brodey looked like he would have a chance to redeem himself at the plate after his yiplike throws in the tophalf as Stanford put the potential tying run on base after stringing together another twoout rally PERIOD

But junior Jonny Locher who represented that trying run attempted to steal second on a  count after getting the steal sign from head coach Mark Marquess PERIOD Indiana reliever Ryan Halstead grooved a fastball over the plate and the catchers throw down to first beat Locher by two full steps PERIOD

Brodeys impact on the game  he also went 2for4 from the batters box  underscores how big of an impact freshmen will play this season for Stanford PERIOD

At the time theyre the best guys to give us a chance to win PERIOD There is an element of growing pains but at the same time were trying to win Marquess said PERIOD So were just trying to give them experience and suffer the consequences PERIOD For freshman its difficult because its hot and cold a little bit until they get used to it  the different caliber of play. stanfords pitching staff held Indiana hitters at bay however for most of the game PERIOD Starter Marcus Brakeman lasted six innings allowing two runs  one earned  on four hits and striking out six PERIOD Hanewich allowed just one hit over . innings and struck out three PERIOD

At the plate sophomore second baseman Tommy Edman went 2for5 with two doubles and an RBI PERIOD

Freshman third baseman Mikey Diekroeger hit a RBI double down the leftfield line in his first atbat at Sunken Diamond eventually going 1for2 on the night also with two hit by pitches PERIOD

The series against Indiana concludes Sunday at noon with Stanford triyng to avoid a seasonopening sweep PERIOD Senior John Hochstatter will get the start for the Cardinal and junior Jake Kelzer will get the call for the Hoosiers PERIOD
