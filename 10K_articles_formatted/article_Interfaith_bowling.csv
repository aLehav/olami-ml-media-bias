Interfaith bowling
Muslim and Jewish
engineers take to the lanes

In an age of evermounting interfaith tension progress is being made on some unlikely fronts PERIOD
Last week on a wintry Saturday night members of the Jewish Engineering Association and the Muslim Engineering Student Association traded their calculus and mechanical engineering homework for bowling balls and bad music at Colonial Lanes in Ann Arbor PERIOD
After lacing up their neon green and orange bowling shoes members from both groups took to the lanes PERIOD As the competition heated up frame by frame members cheered loudly for teammates with each pin knocked over enough to draw the attention of the serious glovewearing bowlers several lanes over PERIOD
One woman in particular sporting a shirt that read A balanced diet means eating chocolate with both hands looked on evidently perplexed by some of the bowlers PERIOD
While waiting between turns the engineers took the opportunity to talk about classes and Middle East politics PERIOD
The great thing about bowling said Jewish Engineering Association member Aaron Potek a College of Engineering senior is that theres time to talk between frames which gave us a chance to really get to know each other without it feeling forced or awkward. some of the engineers discussed their job prospects after college PERIOD A few lamented about having to organize ones life around the North Campus bus schedule PERIOD In between successive strikes Engineering sophomore Josh Weinstein nonchalantly discussed life as an aerospace engineering major PERIOD
Its only rocket science he said PERIOD How hard can it be
At one point a couple members from both associations decided to boost their chances of winning by bowling in the same lane at the same time PERIOD They knocked down a strike on their first try PERIOD
But as Potek dashed to the side of the lane and steadied his camera for what he called a working together moment all the bowlers could muster were two gutter balls PERIOD
After the last pin fell in the final frame members of both groups exchanged email addresses and thanked each other before heading out into the freshly powdered night PERIOD There was no shortage of smiles and jokes to go around PERIOD
Engineering senior Uzair Ali a Muslim Engineering Student Association member said he thought events like these were a positive step forward for Jewish and Muslim students PERIOD
The idea is a particularly resonant one especially given that Israeli and Palestinian leaders met last week in Anapolis Md PERIOD to try to hammer out a peace that has been eluding the two countries for decades PERIOD
Theres a possibility that the talks presided over by a president grasping for a legacy could solve the problem PERIOD On the other hand theres room for improvement with Bushs foreign policy record PERIOD Too bad not all problems can be solved over bowling PERIOD
