Prophesy by Eileen Myles

In this poem Myles uses both humor and evocative and odd imagery to transport the reader into a strange world that Myles writes from PERIOD Down to their writing utensil being the devils cock which is like a fat burnt crayon. myles uses the Devil as a clear reference to the personification of pure evil PERIOD The poem is in free verse and lacks punctuation except for one period in the middle PERIOD

Myles is from Cambridge Massachusetts and is a graduate of UMass Boston PERIOD They have published twenty volumes of both poetry and prose fiction as well as art journalism and libretto work PERIOD They have received four Lambda Book Awards the Shelley Prize a Guggenheim Fellowship and several other accolades PERIOD



her tin skin by Evie Shockley

In this poem Shockley writes about insecurity and wishing to be like another person on the surface PERIOD She wants the subjects tin skin which is repeated over and over in the poem PERIOD She describes the subjects militant barbie breast and mountainous curves as things that she desires PERIOD Shockley writes about her own brownness as well i  want my brownness  to cover all but the silver  edges of my tin skin. a graduate of Northwestern University the University of Michigan and Duke University Shockley is from Nashville Tennessee PERIOD She has had fellowships with Cave Canem the Millay Colony for the Arts the American Council of Learned Societies and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture of the New York Public Library PERIOD She has also been honored with the Holmes National Poetry Prize PERIOD



Unused Baby by Hoa Nguyen

In this poem Nguyen writes with imagery from nature folklore and religion to create a confusing but fascinating piece PERIOD She uses images of everything from blood to frogs to form strong images in the readers mind drawing them in PERIOD This is similar to her general style of poetry which poet Ocean Vuong once described as a poetics insistent on fragmentation and rupture as a mode of thinking and being in the world  one where paradoxically the very notion of fragmentation is in itself a whole PERIOD Her poems remind us that meaning as we understand it does not have to adhere to standard conventions of syntax. nguyen was born in the Mekong Delta Vietnam and grew up in the United States before settling in Canada where she now lives PERIOD She has written several books throughout her career and has been nominated for the Griffin Prize Kingsley Tufts Award National Book Award and the Governor Generals Literary Award PERIOD She has taught creative writing at the graduate and undergraduate levels as well as at community colleges
