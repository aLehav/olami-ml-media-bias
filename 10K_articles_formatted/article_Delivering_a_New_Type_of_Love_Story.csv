After watching trailers forThe Delivery Man I was prepared for a lowbrow comedy about the familiar character of a clueless middleaged man PERIOD I assumed it would be a typical feelgood funny film with cheap jokes PERIOD While the movie did include the obligatory comedic oneliners they were well written and existed in tangent with a surprisingly deepplotline PERIOD

The Delivery Mantells the story of an unmotivated 40something living without any true purpose until he receives some shocking information from a fertility clinic that he once donated to for a tidy sum of  PERIOD It turns out that DavidWozniakVince Vaughn a struggling meat truck driver had donated sperm over  times and consequently fathered  children PERIOD Legal counsel from the clinic informsWozniakthat  of his children are filing a class action lawsuit against the institution in order to find out the identity of their biological father PERIOD

The plot is novel if marked with some blatant logical fallacies PERIOD Why are all these children suddenly consumed by a desire to know their father Why do they all just conveniently happen to live in New York City Director Ken Scott does not address these obvious improbabilities but he does provide the audience with a quality comedy that is refreshingly sentimental PERIOD

The first  minutes seemed to confirm my initial judgments PERIOD The action was slow the relationships confusing and the humor forced PERIOD However the film quickly improved asWozniakembarked on his quest to meet some of his children PERIOD Scott expertly captures these unconventional relationships managing to convey a sense of uncertainty affection and belonging PERIOD Perhaps most touching is the developing relationship betweenWozniakand his mentally handicapped son Ryan S bastien Ren . at first unsure of how to approach Ryan David ultimately vows to remain a strong presence in his life PERIOD

Chris Pratt provides comic relief as Woznaiks bestfriend Brett PERIOD An exhausted disillusioned dad he volunteers to be Wozniaks pinchhitting lawyer eager to get back into the law game PERIOD He is arguably the bestwritten character and his hilarious bluntness alleviates some of the heavier moments in the film PERIOD

While the Wozniakoffspring and Wozniakbest friend relationships definitely contribute to the film but the connection between David and his girlfriend Emma Cobie Smulders seemed halfbaked and detracted from parts of the film PERIOD

All in allThe Delivery Manwas a pleasant surprise PERIOD It was funny and inspiring even in its slightly unrealistic premise and has redeeming qualities it might still be better to wait to watch it until its released on Redbox PERIOD
