Erin Drumm  Wednesday September  

ESPNs College GameDay is coming back to where it started in South Bend this Saturday PERIOD As the Fighting Irish face off against the Ohio State Buckeyes GameDays panel of experts featuring Lee Corso Desmond Howard Pat McAfee Kirk Herbstreit and a guest picker will grace Notre Dame with their presence PERIOD

The last time ESPNs College GameDay was in South Bend was the Clemson vs PERIOD Notre Dame game in November of  when the Irish took down the Tigers in a  win PERIOD

However the last time Ohio State hosted ESPNs College GameDay was last years Notre Dame vs PERIOD Ohio State game in which the Irish fell to Ohio State  PERIOD

The upcoming game day weekend is on everybodys mind and so is one important question Who will be College GameDays celebrity picker at Notre Dame

Last weeks College GameDay at the Colorado State vs PERIOD Colorado game saw a large showing by celebrity fans PERIOD While Lil Wayne might not be leading the Irish out of the locker room this weekend a guest picker will certainly grace the College GameDay stage for the Irish PERIOD

Here are some possibilities

Dick Vitale Legendary ESPN basketball broadcaster Dickie V is known to be an avid Fighting Irish fan and would certainly be welcomed by Notre Dame fans as the guest picker PERIOD Vitale has tweeted that he will be attending the game this weekend and having him as the guest picker would be Awesome Baby

Vince Vaughn Hollywood actor Vince Vaughn was featured in the  film Rudyand is a native of the Chicago area PERIOD Vaughn is a longtime fan of the Irish and could be back in the Bend this weekend PERIOD

Taylor Swift Taylor Swift is perhaps the least likely and most hoped for possible guest picker PERIOD Swifts brother Austin Swift  attended Notre Dame and Swift has been spotted at a Notre Dame game in the past PERIOD Additionally some believe Swifts Champagne Problems to be about a Notre Dame couple PERIOD Though it is highly unlikely Swift will be in South Bend this weekend the guest picker remains a Blank Space at the moment and Notre Dame students are happy to write Swifts name in PERIOD

Last time College GameDay was in South Bend in  Fighting Irish alum and then Pittsburgh Steeler wide receiver Chase Claypool was the guest picker PERIOD Former Fighting Irish players are highly likely to be chosen as the guest picker for this Saturdays matchup as well PERIOD

Manti Teo Beloved Notre Dame AllAmerican Manti Teo could be the guest picker on Saturday PERIOD Teo received a standing ovation last September when he returned to Notre Dame Stadium before the Notre DameCal game PERIOD In July of  the Netflix documentary Untold The Girlfriend Who Didnt Exist premiered and Irish fans got an inside look at Teos experience in college PERIOD

Jerome Bettis Jerome the Bus Bettis is a probable guess for the guest picker this weekend PERIOD Bettis left Notre Dame in his senior year to enter the  NFL Draft but later returned to campus to study where he received his degree with the Class of  PERIOD

This is education related and you can never take away the education PERIOD Thats the message that Im sending my children but also the message that I want everybody to know Bettis said about returning to Notre Dame PERIOD

The Super Bowl winner Hall of Famer and sixtime pro bowler would be a solid choice for ESPNs GameDay picker PERIOD

This is certainly not an exhaustive list and Notre Dame can boast a host of celebrity fans who might appear on the GameDay panel this Saturday PERIOD In  when College GameDay came to South Bend for the Michigan vs PERIOD Notre Dame game country music star Luke Bryan was the guest picker and another dark horse could be chosen as the guest picker this weekend PERIOD

Erin Drumm is a senior at Notre Dame studying American Studies journalism and history PERIOD She is from Philadelphia and spends her summers and every weekend possible at the shore in Cape May County New Jersey PERIOD Outside of The Observer Erin can be found cheering on the Fighting Irish and the Phillies reading and talking about pop culture and history PERIOD She can be reached at emailprotected PERIOD
