UNO administrators recentlyrolled out parking solutions forcampus that are at best a joke onthe proverbial problem studentsfaculty and staff have been fed upwith for years PERIOD

Seriously This is what state funding grants donations and our ownstudent fees are contributing toEnough is enough PERIOD If the collectiveintention of this developing educational institution is to achieve20000 enrolled students by 2020then perhaps we toss another 20in the clever campaign by addingenough parking stalls to match theprestigious goals PERIOD Maybe  morefloors of parking between a coupleof centrallylocated garages

On Feb PERIOD  a public meeting wasslated for discussion regardingparking updates and information.Due to the adverse weather conditions UNO closed that day and themeeting was canceled PERIOD

While promotional efforts for thismeeting were minimal to beginwith we didnt hear much aboutrescheduling PERIOD Perhaps thats because it was never rescheduled Anarrow escape for what was sureto be a heated roundtable PERIOD

The updates that were likelyplanned for sharing do not proveof any significant worth to thoseof us without a reserved parkingstall on the west side of the EppleyAdministration Building PERIOD

Likely buzz to claim efforts are being made to counter the poisons ofparking programs like ride sharingare never going to catch on or berealistic to college students PERIOD

The alternatives to traditional parking included the alreadyknownMavRide program the Zimrideride sharing system the two Zipcarslocated in Lot N and the Emergency Ride Home Service coming soon PERIOD

MavRide is nothing new othert han faculty and staff can now receive passes PERIOD Zimride while innovative is incredibly unlikely to besignificantly impacting PERIOD Zipcar hasbeen on campus for a good amountof time and is utilized a laughableamount during peakpopulationtimes during the school week PERIOD

I have trouble with understandingthe generic definition of an emergency for thefinal option that isyet to roll out PERIOD A free taxi to takepeople home when needed Is thiswhen I run out of gas or when Ineed to get home before my favorite television series or game is on

You are probably reading this behind your desk after being handeda copy from your secretary or highly aware subordinate PERIOD Or maybethis is being read and discussed ina board meeting PERIOD

Either option will yield the same results PERIOD You will furnish The Gatewaywith a politically correct letter ina confidential envelope after feeling wrongly accused or targeted.Or more predictably no commentas you ignore another source thatstokes theflames of the parkingfire PERIOD

Fellow students faculty and staffits time PERIOD Lets make the issue morereal to those not living the catastrophe personally PERIOD Suppose  of usstand in the reserved parking stallsthat line Eppley one morning before the suitedsolutioneers get tocampus PERIOD Gee whiz then those administrators would have to beginsearching for an alternative parkingspot PERIOD

Better yet I propose each of the administrators to swap their reservedstall for a standard parking passthat we all use until reasonable andquantifiable progress is made PERIOD

I hear rumors of Pacific Campusupdates PERIOD Sounds like a great wayto make use of our often crowded and slowmoving shuttle system.Or the possibility of a parking garage erected in Lot H PERIOD That wouldmake complete sense to put a garage next to another on the outskirts of Dodge Campus PERIOD KudosI think not PERIOD
