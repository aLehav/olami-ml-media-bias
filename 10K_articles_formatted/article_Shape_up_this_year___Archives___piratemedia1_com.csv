Generally clear PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Research has shown that even moderate amounts of exercise have a big impact on health PERIOD For most of us however getting into shape and heading to the gym is ultimately much easier said than done PERIOD

Unfortunately according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention the physical activity pattern for many has been established by the time they reach high school PERIOD Given that we have all passed that phase in life its time we take a closer look into our psyche and determine how we can change our motivation PERIOD

After further inspection its evident that stretching cardiorespiratory endurance muscular strength and muscular endurance should all be assessed in any good workout PERIOD Although many of us dread the long and tedious workouts that are often associated with fitness it is important that we learn the make up of a true balanced workout PERIOD

First and foremost stretching is the most essential aspect of physical fitness PERIOD Not only does stretching help to prevent pulled muscles but it has been known to increase flexibility and reduce stress levels PERIOD Daily stretching of about  minutes should be performed slowly and without any bouncing motion PERIOD

In terms of cardiorespiratory endurance engaging in continuous aerobic activity that increases your heart rate is most beneficial PERIOD Such activities can include brisk walking jogging swimming or cycling and should be done for at least  minutes at least three times a week PERIOD

To those of us who dont visit the gym frequently weight lifting can seem too intense PERIOD Although many of us admire the results we are often not driven enough to try our hand at such a workout PERIOD Unfortunately those of us with such views may be disappointed to discover The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that both aerobic and anaerobic exercise strength training be included in any balanced fitness program PERIOD

Furthermore scientists have found that many people even those who get regular aerobic exercise suffer rapid erosion of muscle mass around age  PERIOD To reduce the chances of such muscle drain occurring one should engage in a regular program of strength training PERIOD A basic program involves lifting small free weights or lifting weights or stretching large elastic bands on stationary universal exercise machines PERIOD To increase muscular strength it is recommended that 20minute sessions of weight lifting be included into your workout plan at least twice a week PERIOD In order to build muscular endurance all of the major muscle groups should be exercised at least three times a week in 30minute workouts PERIOD Calisthenics pushups situps pullups and weight training are most effective for building such endurance PERIOD

So now that we are all a bit more familiar with the composition of a successful workout plan its time to hear a bit of good news PERIOD Here on campus we are all fortunate to have a Campus Recreation and Wellness Center that can help us obtain that healthy body and lifestyle that we long for PERIOD

The SRC includes indoor and outdoor pools a climbing wall six basketball courts tons of free weights over  square feet of space housing various weight and cardio machines a walking track and more PERIOD The fitness programs include personal training group fitness classes seminars workshops and instructional classes designed to provide education about a variety of healthy lifestyle options PERIOD

As  begins may we all strive to keep those New Years resolutions pertaining to physical fitness PERIOD No matter how you go about it just remember to get out and get active this year PERIOD
