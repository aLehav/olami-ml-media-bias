Cher sneaked back in to Ukraine to rescue a bear PERIOD

The 77yearold singers Free The Wild organisation managed to evacuate a tiger six lions and a panther from a zoo in the country before Vladimir Putins Russia invaded last year but after they were unable to move the creature at the time the group later went back in a rented vehicle to bring him across the border too PERIOD

She told The Hollywood Reporter We went in before the war and did everything to get them out PERIOD But we left the bear so we had to sneak back in with a big pickup truck and get him out during the war. the Believe hitmaker was also involved in another animal rescue effort a lengthy legal battle to have elephant Kaavan removed from Islamabad Zoo in Pakistan PERIOD

She said It took me five years in court to get Kaavan out of that zoo but Islamabad finally understood exactly why it needed to be done. cher made the fight to free Kaavan  who was dubbed the worlds loneliest elephant after being left alone in captivity after his companion Saheli died in  a personal crusade because her efforts to have another elephant Billy moved from Los Angeles Zoo to a sanctuary PERIOD

She said The truth is that I saved Kaavan because I couldnt save Billy PERIOD

And Billy still suffers every day PERIOD

Now we are working with one of if not the most developed nations on the planet the United States and our own people dont seem to understand or appreciate the effects of zoo life on these creatures PERIOD He deserves to spend his last years in a sanctuary. in December the LA City Council recommended 38yearold Billy be moved to a sanctuary but the zoo disagreed PERIOD
