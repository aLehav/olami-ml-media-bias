Silence penetrated the auditorium air the minute hands ticktock the only indicator of time and the existence of an outside world PERIOD
Tis the atmosphere of a final PERIOD Students furiously scribbling answers to questions that only moments before existed at the fronts of their brains PERIOD
Some come into this environment completely prepared ready to be done with the course confidence oozing from their pores PERIOD Others do not PERIOD
Angela Marani a freshman majoring in accounting shakes with nervousness and anticipation PERIOD
I am so not prepared for this test Marani said PERIOD I studied for close to  hours but I am still not ready. lack of preparation seems a common trend among the students present for this exam PERIOD Facial expressions convey their feelings PERIOD Furrowed brows tense mouths or even the facade of a smile cannot disguise their anxiety PERIOD
I studied last night for about five minutes but Im not too worried said Mike Lady an undecided sophomore PERIOD Im not worried because I know I can sit next to Angela. receiving a grade passing a class and graduating inspire the students to position themselves in a place of such high pressure PERIOD
Sarah who refused to divulge her last name for fear of classmates considering her an extremist said shes been studying nonstop for three days PERIOD
Its definitely my own fault for not being prepared added the French graduate student PERIOD Im overwhelmed by all of the material. the preparation finished students find seats with careful decisiveness PERIOD Every other seat occupied tension grips the air PERIOD
The professor deliberates on which side of the room to begin the exam handout phase PERIOD Ticktock chimes the clock PERIOD
It has begun PERIOD The questions vary from material covered only four days prior to vague definitions taught at the beginning of the quarter PERIOD
Some squirm others gaze into space though glassy eyes  thinking possibly of vacation a cold beer or sleep something so taken for granted a few short weeks ago PERIOD
I havent slept much lately  the three hours last night were more than the night before Marani said PERIOD Im exhausted and will be so relieved when this thing is over. after an hour students begin filing out of the auditorium PERIOD Their faces express passive thoughts complete and utter alleviation PERIOD The stress lines vanish smiles resurface and some even brave a chuckle PERIOD
Learning whether all of the studying or lack thereof paid off will be apparent in about two weeks but for now it doesnt matter PERIOD
I am so glad that is over Sarah said PERIOD That was the last of my three exams and it feels good. a shared response the nods of others affirm her position PERIOD With a renewed spirit the students exit the building more than ready to be done  until next quarter that is PERIOD
