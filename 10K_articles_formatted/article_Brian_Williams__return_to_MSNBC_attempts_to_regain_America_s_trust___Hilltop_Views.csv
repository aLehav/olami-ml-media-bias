4194,2023-11-04,"brian Williams is back on television after a seven month absence PERIOD

Print EditorinChiefOctober  

Ever since Pope Francis stepped foot in the United States it seems like he has been performing miracles and answering prayers PERIOD
Many Republicans have been praying for Speaker John Boehner to go away PERIOD Well about  hours after Francis addressed Congress the speaker made an announcement He was resigning as speaker and leaving the House of Representatives PERIOD
In a move that should not have surprised anyone the pope met with Kim Davis the county clerk in Kentucky who refused to issue samesex marriage licenses PERIOD They prayed for each other and this will probably be the closest that Davis will ever be to God PERIOD
The pope also performed a miracle that many thought wouldnt happen  resurrecting disgraced former NBC anchor Brian Williams career PERIOD
After a seven month hiatus Williams was back in front of a live camera the day Francis blessed the U.S PERIOD with his presence PERIOD This was a wise move by MSNBC  Williams home for the foreseeable future  because millions of eyes would be looking to their televisions to watch the pope in a very predictable trip PERIOD With the popes visit being very predictable that meant Williams could rebuild his trust with America PERIOD
Will America ever trust Brian Williams again That is something to be seen but one thing is certain No matter how much repairing Williams does to his career it will never return to its previous heights PERIOD 
Williams is back but now hes just MSNBCs breaking news anchor PERIOD No longer is he a part of the big three nightly news show PERIOD No longer is he a part of millions of Americans evening routines. but nothing will change the fact that he is still Brian Williams PERIOD Even with the whole embellishing situation surrounding his departure from NBC Williams is still one of the biggest names and brands that NBC News has to offer PERIOD
MSNBC was where Williams really got his shot in the big leagues of broadcast journalism so it is fitting for him to return home. currently MSNBC is in a state of transition from being a liberal opinionbased network to a news network that does real factbased journalism PERIOD
The networks entire schedule has been changed with daytime dominated by what matters news PERIOD It still has opinion shows like The Rachel Maddow Show but no longer is MSNBC trying to be the Democrats mouthpiece or the antiFox News PERIOD MSNBC is trying to go back to its roots as a traditional news network PERIOD
That is exactly what Williams is doing PERIOD He and MSNBC have both screwed up in recent years and are both damaged brands but together they can lift themselves up and reinvigorate their lives PERIOD
