Its harder for us to resolve arguments Gordon said PERIOD Im not sure how but when youre in person with each other its easier to fix situations rather than over a text message or a phone call. inperson interactions allow both parties to read each others facial expressions and body language two key elements that aid in understanding how ones partner is feeling PERIOD An article by selfgrowth.com called The Importance of Body Language states that when we connect with a person we also have to make it clear to each other how the content of a spoken message needs to be interpreted PERIOD Without the nuances of facial expression and body language words can lack context and may be misunderstood PERIOD
