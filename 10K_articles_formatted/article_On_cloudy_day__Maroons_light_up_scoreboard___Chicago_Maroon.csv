Amid chilling downpours and swirling winds the sort of weather that usually mutes cheerleaders and banishes mascots to heated clubhouses the Maroons resoundingly defeated Ohio Wesleyan  snapping a twogame losing streak and improving to  on the season PERIOD

Abetted by superb defensive and special teams play the Maroons capitalized early and often on a multiplicity of Ohio Wesleyan turnovers PERIOD

The Maroons jumped to a  lead halfway through the first quarter after secondyear Cameron Grimes blocked a punt immediately recovered and run into the endzone by secondyear Alex Dzierbicki PERIOD

The Maroons continued to wreak havoc against an Ohio Wesleyan special teams unit that seemed intent upon competing with the weather for the least attractive portion of the days events PERIOD

The Maroons recovered a fumbled punt early in the second quarter later extending the lead to  after a successful 20yard field goal from firstyear Jeff Sauer PERIOD

After a threeandout for the Battling Bishops on the following possession the Maroons once again blocked punter Brandon Urankars attempt leading to a oneyard rushing touchdown by thirdyear Francis Adarkwa PERIOD

The subsequent possession for the Battling Bishops yielded much the same result three ineffective downs giving way to a third blocked punt and a scrambling touchdown by firstyear quarterback Vincent Cortina who was making just the second start of his career on Saturday PERIOD

Quite honestly I determined early on in our preparation that we had a significant schematic advantage against OWU said linebacker and special teams coach Daniel Gritti PERIOD The weather actually hurt our special teams PERIOD If the surface was less slippery we would have blocked one if not two more punts. the dominant Maroons took a  lead into halftime PERIOD

We added a few designed quarterback running plays suitable for me and a wildcat offense said Cortina explaining the teams offensive strategy coming into the game PERIOD The weather was a huge factor in the game planning and execution PERIOD The weather completely took away the passing game PERIOD It made us rely more on the run which in the end turned out to be ok.

Ohio Wesleyan  struggled offensively throughout the game proving unable to advance the ball against a stifling Chicago defense PERIOD The Maroon wall continuously closed running holes and managed to smother the Battling Bishops ground game PERIOD

This strength was reflected in the box score Ohio Wesleyan was forced to pass the ball  times as opposed to the seven passes attempted by the Maroons PERIOD This was largely because of the early Maroon lead and a repeated inability to forward the ball on first and second downs PERIOD

We knew what we wanted to accomplish going in and that was to eliminate the big play element and shut down the run through physical play said thirdyear defensive lineman Jake Longtin who had . sacks on the day PERIOD They ran an offense that our type of defense is specifically finetuned to shut down.Fortunately the weather was more detrimental for OWU than it was for us. the games outcome was clearly determined halfway through the second quarter signaling an important statement from the Maroons just one week before homecoming PERIOD The Maroons had dropped their previous two games by a combined score of  but improved their home record to  PERIOD

Coming off their dominant performance Saturday the Maroons look ahead to next weeks homecoming against Denison expecting the return of starting fourthyear quarterback Marshal Oium from injury PERIOD

Speaking of expectations moving forward Coach Gritti explained To paraphrase an old commercial This isnt your fathers Maroon football. playing well is no longer good enough PERIOD We only care about being great and winning championships PERIOD Accomplishing anything less is an abject failure on the part of both the coaches and the players. your donation will support the student journalists of University of Chicago PERIOD Your contributions go towards our annual website hosting costs and equipment costs PERIOD
