Whens the last time you saw a planet  lightyears away Or talked about water on Mars or the the New Horizons mission

These are some of the topics that the members of the Stargazers club discuss at their weekly meetings PERIOD

The club recently held their open observation night on Oct. and packed over  guests PERIOD The observatory sits atop the Science Building on the Rockville Campus PERIOD All of the guests were astonished by what they could see through the professional telescopes like the Ring Nebula that is  lightyears away PERIOD The club tries to organize an observatory night for its members every couple of weeks PERIOD

However members say that the club has more to offer than experiencing the views through MCs observatory PERIOD

I originally joined just for the observation nights but the meetings and discussions alone are very fun and worth the time said club member David Chang PERIOD

That is what the Stargazers are all about to inspire the college community as a whole to learn more about modern astronomy in fun and exciting ways PERIOD

One of the most important things about the club is that its not just recreational said president Bhakti Patel it is also very educational and you get to learn a whole lot. the club also wants to add to the social life on campus PERIOD Every meeting Patel starts off with introducing herself and lets the others do the same PERIOD

I always start off the meetings with introducing each other so we can get to know one another a lot better Patel said PERIOD You get to know all of the members rather than just go hey and try to avoid them after the meetings are over. the club organizes different events such as visiting the Air and Space Museum observation nights movie nights and Solar Observation days PERIOD Students are also motivated to come up with ideas of their own for future trips and on campus events PERIOD

Sam Kirschbaum an active contributing member to the club mentioned that hes most excited about going to watch The Martian with the others as well as going to The Air and Space Museum. if you have a busy schedule and would like to join dont worry if you cant make it to every single meeting PERIOD

We dont require you to come every week we are flexible Patel said PERIOD Just come on in and we will keep in touch with you

The Stargazers club meets every Wednesday afternoon in the Science Center SC400 at  pm PERIOD

If you have any questions regarding to the club email professor Carrie Fitzgerald at emailprotected PERIOD Make sure to check out their blog at httpmcobservatory.blogspot.com for more information and dates of upcoming events PERIOD
