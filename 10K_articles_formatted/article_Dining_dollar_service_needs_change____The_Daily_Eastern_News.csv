The Dining Dollars portion of Easterns meal plan does not serve students as it should PERIOD The solution to this issue lies with both the administration and the students themselves PERIOD



As it stands Dining Dollars which can be purchased with a meal plan or in  increments are neither rolled over nor refunded at the end of the academic year PERIOD Western Illinois University Northern Illinois University and Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville all have systems that allow students to use their meal plans more efficiently PERIOD

Westerns plan allows students to deduct from a lump sum rather than a combination of meals and a separate dollar amount for food in dining centers PERIOD The overhead cost of their meals is taken off before purchase so students essentially pay wholesale prices PERIOD

Dining money can also be used in university vending machines and laundry facilities PERIOD Unused money is refunded at the end of each year PERIOD

Northerns plan is similar in that it allows students to use allotted money for items other than dining center food but money is allotted weekly and is not reimbursed PERIOD

Southerns plan also allows students to pay approximately  percent of the normal cost of food because it subtracts overhead cost PERIOD

Easterns Dining Dollars are not rolled over from spring to fall or summer to fall because of the cushion that is built into the meal count portion of the plan PERIOD University Dining Director Jody Horn said this cushion is provided because the university knows students dont eat all of their meals PERIOD If Eastern were to adopt a plan similar to the schools mentioned above she said it would also have to transition into a more rigid a la carte type system PERIOD She also said Eastern would have to charge more than it currently does for food PERIOD But the increase in exchange for a more widely usable meal plan system could be worth it to students PERIOD

Easterns use it or lose it principle is costing students in the long run PERIOD The administration should seriously consider adopting methods like other schools in the state to help students get the most for their money PERIOD In turn students should plan ahead accordingly as to not waste their money on lost meals and Dining Dollars PERIOD
