Nate Nkumbu Contributing WriterApril  

You may have heard Doug Obermans name read off a class roster PERIOD Soon Broward residents will also read it on a ballot PERIOD

Oberman a Democrat and public safety administration major is running for the Florida House of Representatives against incumbent Republican George Moraitis PERIOD The seat they are vying for is in District  which covers northeast Broward County PERIOD

Im up for the challenge Oberman said of taking on Moraitis who has been holding office for six years PERIOD Its all about confidence and as long as I hold that confidence and envision defeating Moraitis then I can beat him. at  years old Oberman would be the youngest representative in the state PERIOD The Florida House of Representatives allows anyone who is at least  years old to run for election PERIOD

He added that the reason hes running is because of his passion for public service PERIOD His campaign revolves around two issues clean energy and championing LGBT rights PERIOD

Theres matters in the legislature that need to be brought up he said PERIOD LGBT and gender identity need to be given protection class status PERIOD Clean energy is also an issue that needs more attention PERIOD

He said that many from the LGBT community can be fired from their jobs or denied housing because of their sexual preferences PERIOD He also emphasized that there is a large amount of potential in the state for solar and wind energy technology PERIOD

Oberman attacked his opponent by questioning his rapport with the people he represents PERIOD Not many people in northeast Broward County know who Moraitis is nor do the people know that hes their representative PERIOD Theres a level of disconnect. he continued We see the system in Tallahassee is broken PERIOD We also see that many people in Tallahassee are nothing more but cogs in the Republican machine PERIOD They dont help their constituents. reached for comment at his office Tuesday Moraitis disagreed through Blake MacDiarmid his campaign strategist PERIOD

Representative Moraitis is born and raised in the district PERIOD He has made education and and the economy his top priority in Tallahassee and he has been elected three times because of his work in the legislation said Diarmid PERIOD

When asked about how he balances his personal life and his campaign Oberman said I dont have much of a social life because of this. he added It takes a lot of time and a few people are helping to run my campaign PERIOD Theres a lot of people in both northeast Broward County and within the Democratic Party that are going door to door and campaigning PERIOD It takes a lot of volunteers and time. joseph Kreps is one of Obermans supporters PERIOD The two met at an Owls for Bernie event in Miami PERIOD

A selfproclaimed activist for the Democratic Party in South Florida Kreps says his support for Oberman is because of the candidates willingness to shake the system in Tallahassee PERIOD

I am thrilled to see the interest and passion in the youth of our country concerning this current election cycle Kreps said in an email PERIOD The most valuable thing that we as citizens have is our ability to vote PERIOD Unfortunately our political parties do nothing to bring fresh new faces and ideas into the system. the activist suggested that adults enter politics early for the good of the political system PERIOD I wish more young men and women would run for office and the the political parties would embrace them and their ideas Kreps said PERIOD It is my pleasure to offer advice and encouragement to Doug and welcome the medias interest in his campaign. oberman said he has the peoples best interest in mind and that the man tasked with acting on their behalf is no longer the best option PERIOD

We need someone in office to defend the people to fight for them. nate Nkumbu is a contributing writer with the University Press PERIOD For information regarding this or other stories email emailprotected or tweet him FoureyedNate PERIOD
