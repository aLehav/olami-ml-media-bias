5225,2007-02-20,"the CU Police Department is looking for an unidentified man who entered numerous residence halls last weekend and crawled into bed with female residents PERIOD The suspect said he was drunk and was looking for a place to crash while he fondled and attempted to kiss female dorm residents before being chased away according to police reports PERIOD

According to the CUPD shortly after  a.m PERIOD on Friday an unknown male entered rooms in Baker Libby and Smith dormitories on campus and nestled into bed with several women looking for a place to sleep. just before  a.m PERIOD on Saturday police received additional reports of a male with a similar description entering rooms in Kittredge West PERIOD

The suspect is described as a thin tanned white male approximately  to  years of age PERIOD The women said he was between  feet  inches and  feet  inches tall and wearing a dark colored windbreaker or sweatshirt with a hood PERIOD It is unknown how the suspect gained entrance into the buildings as each building requires key card access around the clock PERIOD

Victims said that while the suspect claimed to be drunk he neither smelled nor behaved as though he had been drinking PERIOD

This looks to be the work of one individual said CUPD Lt PERIOD Brad Wiesley PERIOD Weve stepped up patrols in dorm areas to ensure the safety of the residents. cUPD has issued safety alerts for the residence halls and urged residents to be conscientious of strangers in or around the buildings and to call police immediately if anyone seen in the buildings matches the suspect description or behaves suspiciously PERIOD

A number of the rooms the suspect walked into were unlocked Wiesley said PERIOD It should be common sense to make sure your dorm room door is locked when you go to sleep. cUPD says that the case is unusual in that they havent seen a string of connected incidents like this PERIOD At least six dormitory rooms were invaded by the suspect PERIOD

Were trying to get the word out through a variety of ways so that students are aware of whats going on Wiesley said PERIOD Our first priority is to keep the students safe and our second priority is to catch this individual. the suspect did not resist or fight back when chased out of the rooms PERIOD

It made me a little nervous Brittany Taylor a freshman architecture major said PERIOD I always make sure to lock my door. but some residents dont always lock their doors PERIOD

Ive seen people just let anyone in the outside doors Erin O Malley a freshman openoption major said PERIOD

The CUPD asks that anyone with any information on these cases contact the police detective division at   as soon as possible PERIOD CU also provides confidential victim assistance services for all members of the university community and they may be reached at   or on the Web here PERIOD
