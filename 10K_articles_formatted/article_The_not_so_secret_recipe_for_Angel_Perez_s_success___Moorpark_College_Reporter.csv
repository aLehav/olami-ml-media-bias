Angel Perez a 19yearold Biology student and a twotime captain for the mens soccer team at Moorpark College is on his final stages before transferring to a fouryear university and taking the next step of his school career PERIOD Perezs biggest struggle during his time at Moorpark College was balancing school work and family as well as the responsibility of being the captain for his college team PERIOD

My biggest challenge was trying to balance the difficulty of my major along with my training hours Perez said I have always been dedicated to training outside of practice and so to put in those hours and also have to study at the same time was challenging. a Simi Valley native of Mexican descendant Perez is the second child of four kids of his parents Angel Perez Sr PERIOD and Olga Perez PERIOD Perez Sr PERIOD has always been close and supportive with his children and was a big part of Perezs influence to get out on the soccer field PERIOD

I enrolled Angel at the age six in Simi Valley Youth Soccer League we are a big soccer family Perez Sr PERIOD said PERIOD My father is a huge soccer fan and never misses a game I played growing up with local teams and her older sister also played while Angel was young. perez is a natural boxtobox central midfielder PERIOD He enjoys running up and down the field as well as winning and recovering the ball PERIOD He feels confident being at a key role in the heart of the field and enjoys being the one responsible for creating key plays inside the field PERIOD

Perez has always stayed motivated inside the field by the love of the game and his father has been a huge motivation for him outside the field PERIOD

My dad inspires me inside and outside the field PERIOD Whenever he comes to the games I feel a chip over my shoulder and I tend to play better Perez said PERIOD Even if I had a good game he always tells me what I can do to improve my game. angel arrived at Moorpark College during the fall semester of  PERIOD He is an experienced soccer player that has been playing for both club soccer and all four years at Royal High School PERIOD

As a natural born leader Angel was chosen by head coach Jake Gwin to be one the captains during his first year playing for Moorpark College PERIOD

Angel is a mentally tough guy said Gwin PERIOD He is a leader and he always steps up on tough situations. with the support of Gwin Perez took the captain role for both his freshman and sophomore years at Moorpark College PERIOD He took the role headon and was comfortable with the role as he had been the captain at Royal High School for his junior and senior years PERIOD

I was a freshman and it was my first year at Moorpark but I have already understood my role as a starting midfielder Perez said PERIOD As soon as Jake said he wanted me to be the captain I said yes and told him I would do my best PERIOD I felt very honored. perezs biggest challenge while being captain was keeping the players motivated and playing together at a high level in such a tough conference against highquality teams like Oxnard Santa Barbara and Santa Monica College PERIOD This was not an easy challenge for Perez but with the help of Coach Gwin and his family Perez was able to overcome a busy semester full of challenging games long hours of studying and stressful tests PERIOD

I just had to look forward towards the future PERIOD I had a great coach who talked to me a lot and every time I needed an outburst or just wanted to let go my family was there to help Perez said PERIOD

Perezs love for biology first came when he suffered a severe injury known as a Jones fracture of the fifth metatarsal inside the field during his junior year of high school which put him on the sidelines the rest of the season PERIOD

Along the way of my recovery the more I did some research I fell in love with medicine and surgery Perez said PERIOD I had something taken away from me that I love to play and ever since then I knew I want to work with bones and ligaments and pursue the medical field. the help and advice from all his family members are what kept Perez looking forward to his end goal to one day to attend medical school become a surgeon and help others PERIOD Perez applied to several schools the list includes Johns Hopkins University Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and UCLA PERIOD Perez made sure that each school he applied to had a soccer program so he can still be out on the field PERIOD

Perez has had a successful time at Moorpark College and is hoping to finish off his spring semester strong before transferring PERIOD Currently having a . gPA and being named Athlete of the Month of September is proof that Perezs hard work is paying off PERIOD

I have two younger brothers an older sister and the best parents in the world to me and every time I needed to talk to them about anything they were there for me said Perez PERIOD

He has proven that with the right mentality and with the support of your loved ones the sky is the limit PERIOD
