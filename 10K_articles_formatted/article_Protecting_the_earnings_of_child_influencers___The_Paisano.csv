A Swifties analysis of  Taylors Version

As we dive further into the digital era and our addiction to social media intensifies the creators behind our screens profit PERIOD There are a variety of creators catering to our interests making content we want to see PERIOD But as the social media industry grows we begin to see younger influencers some even as young as two years old PERIOD And yes these minors are able to earn money from being influencers but are they actually accessing what they earn

Instagram TikTok and YouTube are all platforms where content is available to us anytime any place anywhere PERIOD Influencers can create content for their viewers and earn anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars and this is not limited to adults PERIOD Any parent can create an Instagram account for their child and many have PERIOD Influencer families such as the Ace Family have made content creation a part of their everyday lifestyle PERIOD With their children in the limelight the parents Catherine and Austin McBroom are able to earn money off their personal accounts PERIOD

Because there are not enough laws to protect these children  similar to how child stars were financially exploited back in the day  there is no telling how these childrens earnings are being distributed PERIOD However in  a protective law was established to keep child actors from enduring financial abuse PERIOD This law known as the Coogan Law unfortunately does not extend to child influencers PERIOD The Coogan Law otherwise known as The California Child Actors Bill requires that a percentage of child actors earnings are placed into a trust that the child can access once they turn  PERIOD This law also extends to child models and voice actors PERIOD

The Coogan Law goes by other names in other states but the rules stay the same PERIOD  of a minor actors earnings must be saved until they reach adulthood  and these accounts are required in New York Louisiana Kansas Nevada Illinois North Carolina Pennsylvania Tennessee and New Mexico. these states all have different requirements for these accounts PERIOD

These protective laws should be altered and extended to child influencers PERIOD Not every minor is as lucky as Charli DAmelio was PERIOD Over the years she has continued to make and access the millions she has earned PERIOD Many young influencers are being taken advantage of as their parents continue to use them and their content for their own financial and personal gain PERIOD If these children are constantly being filmed or being used for online content such as YouTube videos TikToks and Instagram stories they are being stripped of the ideal childhood they deserve PERIOD Like many child actors who were overworked for years by companies such as Disney and Nickelodeon these children too deserve access to their earnings PERIOD

Change can be made if we raise awareness and advocate for the Coogan Law to apply to child influencers PERIOD Illinois has already begun the movement so it is not impossible it just takes effort PERIOD

Based on the Coogan Law Illinois has passed a law that will begin on July   PERIOD Illinois new child labor law will entitle influencers under the age of  to receive a percentage of their earnings PERIOD This law will apply to influencers who feature in videos on online platforms. the parents of these individuals will be obligated to place  of the earnings of such videos into a blocked trust fund PERIOD If Illinois can make the change other states can too PERIOD

Although extending the Coogan Law to child influencers would begin the movement  is not nearly enough to be placed in a trust fund PERIOD It would be beneficial and wisest for the rules of the trust accounts to differ by age PERIOD For example the younger the child actor or influencer the higher the percentage of their earnings should have to be placed in a trust and once  they should be allowed to access their earnings PERIOD

We are in a new era and it is time for new laws PERIOD Child influencers are being taken advantage of the same way child actors were for many years PERIOD Child labor laws need to be updated and extended to child influencers as well PERIOD It is time to protect these minors and their earnings PERIOD
