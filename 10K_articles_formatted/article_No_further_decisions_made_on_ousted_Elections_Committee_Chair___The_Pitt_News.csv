Its unclear whether Student Government Boards recently ousted Elections Chair will oversee next weeks election PERIOD

Former Elections Committee Chair Lauren Barney will appeal the Boards decision to dismiss her in an open hearing slated tentatively for Wednesday or Thursday according to Judicial Committee Chair Audrey Winn PERIOD The Board Elections Committee and Judicial Committee will attend the hearing PERIOD

The Board notified Barney of her dismissal Friday in an email citing misconduct that was prompted partly by a hearing and deliberation that she held in the Boards office on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD The meeting followed Presidential candidate Wasi Mohameds complaint about competitor and current Board Member Graeme Meyer and his affiliated 87s slate PERIOD

Because it was an email it didnt outline every point that went into the decision to dismiss her Winn said adding that questioning Barneys former committee will give the judicial committee a deeper understanding of what she was dismissed for. both parties can provide evidence Winn said including any email threads notes names of witnesses and the audio recording of the Boards meeting with Barney on Friday before her dismissal PERIOD

In this hearing everyone seems worried about corruption of evidence because there are so many people with overlapping roles Winn said PERIOD

The judicial committee prioritized the case of Barneys dismissal Winn said before another outstanding complaint filed by Meyer about Barneys bias PERIOD If Barney retains her position then the judicial committee will address Meyers complaint according to Winn PERIOD

At the upcoming hearing the Board will outline its private deliberation to dismiss Barney according to Board President Mike Nites PERIOD Nites said hell be identifying each different thing that the Board felt and had an issue with that shaped its decision PERIOD

With one week before the election Barney said her abrupt firing will make it difficult for her replacement and former vice chair Kevin Tracey to effectively assume her responsibilities PERIOD

They removed me on terms that were illegitimate Barney said PERIOD They are trying to ensure an honest fair and efficient election  which is my job  but thats hypocrisy  Theyre making an unfair inefficient and dishonest election. nites however disagreed and said he thinks Tracey will be able to fluently transition into the role PERIOD

I dont envision it impacting the election from the Election Committees point of view really that much at all he said PERIOD

While Barney contests her firing Nites said the Boards right to intervene on a Committee chairs performance becomes an issue every year. the SGB Constitution prohibits the Board from exerting any undue influence on committees operations which is why Nites said he hesitated to approach Barney on Oct PERIOD  until after her committees deliberation concluded PERIOD

He said the Board plans to more concretely define undue influence in its Governing Code and Constitution PERIOD

As long as we do things in a way that is fair and is following the procedures that are outlined and were not coercing and were not threatening and its more reactionary  I dont think theres any undue influence in that case Nites said PERIOD
