The Council commits to an extended and intense effort to address the Black Lives Matters movement and systemic racism reads a resolution that has been drafted for the meeting Tuesday PERIOD

According to the staff memo the City Council does not have the authority to enforce some of the groups demands PERIOD

Demands that the council does not have authority over include

Its inability to require equity toolkits for private businesses is due to current state law which makes the city unable to pass its own law requiring such action PERIOD The memo said the city has been using racial equity toolkits since  and  city departments have completed training on the toolkits PERIOD

Human Rights Coordinator and Equity Director Stafeine Bowers said in the memo that the remaining departments would complete training this year PERIOD

The memo said evictions are handled by the Johnson County Sheriffs Office and Iowa City Police only assist if requested in emergency situations PERIOD

In an interview with The Daily Iowan on June  Councilor John Thomas said he anticipates the council will be able to dismiss the charges against protesters at Tuesdays meeting as it was one of the key issues to be addressed PERIOD He did not comment on the other demands PERIOD

There are responses from staff to the issues to their demands where things stand now he said PERIOD And some of them may be answered to their satisfaction. councilor Laura Bergus said she thinks the most important demand that should be addressed Tuesday is the demand that calls for the Iowa City Police Department to be restructured PERIOD It should be done in a way that still provides public safety without requiring officers to respond to every possible call she said PERIOD

Among the Freedom Riders demands is a plan to restructure ICPD toward community policing PERIOD The memo mentioned steps already taken by the department but it didnt indicate whether the council has the authority to fully disband and restructure the department similar to what the Minneapolis City Council has announced intentions to do PERIOD

Bergus will be presenting a draft resolution she created to the other members of the city council at the meeting Tuesday PERIOD She hopes it will be a starting point toward a more concrete plan for the important policy changes but ultimately doesnt know how the council will vote tonight PERIOD

We are committed to change and I hope that by now people have seen and heard that she said PERIOD These are complex problems that unfortunately are going to require some complex solutions PERIOD But what weve got right now is the will of the city leadership to do that and I think were going to start making some real change. mayor Bruce Teague was not available for comment at the time of publication PERIOD
