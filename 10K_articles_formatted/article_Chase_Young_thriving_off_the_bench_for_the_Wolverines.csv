In its  victory over Bellarmine on Tuesday afternoon the Michigan mens lacrosse team saw many contributors rise to the occasion to help the team start the season  PERIOD Despite registering just one assist perhaps no player was more impactful than defensive midfielder Chase Young PERIOD

After coming off the bench the junior scored his second point of the  season on an assist to Parker McKee PERIOD

Though he didnt trot onto the field with the starters Michigan coach Kevin Conry clarified that Young is still an indispensible member of the team and is essentially a starter in every way but title PERIOD

He plays pretty much the whole game Conry said when asked about Youngs status as a reserve PERIOD I dont know if we can increase his playing time. young who was named the teams  Freshman of the Year is easily one of the Wolverines fastest players as he routinely sprinted and weaved his way past Knights defenders to help set up offensive opportunities for his teammates PERIOD

He was also fantastic on the defensive side of the ball PERIOD Young stood tall when the ball crossed Michigans side of the field and led a defensive unit that allowed just seven goals PERIOD Young spoke about his efforts on fastbreaks after the win noting that his ability to improvise is a big reason for his success in that area PERIOD

Im really just trying to think on the fly and get the ball to the attackmen and see what they can do with it Young said PERIOD Its definitely something I look forward to. youngs ability to create chances for the Wolverines makes him one of the teams most important players despite being a reserve PERIOD His vision in the open field helped Michigan find easy scoring chances to provide a cushion in what ended up being a tight contest PERIOD

Young says that he knows his role on the team and simply does his job when Conry calls his number finding pride in the fact that his coach sees him as a figure that can help spark the team PERIOD

Im just playing defense he said PERIOD I definitely like how coach calls upon me to fill a spark for the team and I just do to make sure that were dialed in at all time. despite Bellarmine being a relatively weak squad on paper Young still believes that the victory is something that Michigan should be proud of PERIOD

When it comes down to it its tough to get a W in college lacrosse Young said PERIOD We take this one just like we take any W. 

While the season can be a long and tumultuous roller coaster of emotions filled with triumph and defeat it appears that Young has cemented his role in Conrys system as a doitall player PERIOD Conry believes that his unique skill set on both sides of the field can help him become one of the best short stick midfielders in the country PERIOD

Only time will tell if his prediction comes true but one thing is for sure We havent seen the last of Chase Young who figures to serve as an impact player on an exciting young Michigan squad PERIOD
