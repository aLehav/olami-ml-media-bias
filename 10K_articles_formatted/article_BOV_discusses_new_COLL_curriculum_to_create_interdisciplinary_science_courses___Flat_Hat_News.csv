8410,2023-11-05,"when the Board of Visitors met this week they learned that a new COLL curriculum class may be in the early stages of development for future freshmen at the College of William and Mary PERIOD

Biology professor Margaret Saha said that she plans to expand the field of synthetic biology in the Colleges academic environment PERIOD Synthetic biology an interdisciplinary branch of biology and engineering involves topics such as biotechnology bioengineering and genetic engineering among others PERIOD Saha said she believes that the interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology makes it a very interesting choice of study for incoming students at the College PERIOD

Ithoughtthis topic would be perfect for that sort of course Saha said PERIOD Its reprogramming life or even if you take it to an extreme makinglife PERIOD One idea was looking at this throughout history and blending it with historical sources. ithoughtthis topic would be perfect for that sort of course Saha said PERIOD Its reprogramming life or even if you take it to an extreme makinglife PERIOD One idea was looking at this throughout history and blending it with historical sources. saha says that she envisions a COLL  class  a discussionbased class that all freshmen at the College are required to take  which intertwines synthetic biology with historical or literary elements to attract liberal arts students PERIOD Saha who holds a doctoral degree in history in addition to one in biology said that she always tries to think of her research topics with a historical perspective PERIOD She said Frankenstein could work as a crossstudy between literature and synthetic biology PERIOD

Saha also serves as the faculty administrator for the Colleges International Genetically Engineered Machine or iGEM team of which student Caroline Golino  is the captain PERIOD In a presentation to the Board of Visitors Feb PERIOD  Golino discussed the importance of synthetic biology to many different research projects in science PERIOD She discussed the iGEM teams  awardwinning project on biological noise and its role in genetic circuits PERIOD

Our project focused on realworld circuits that have realworld applications such as biosensors or other things Golino said PERIOD If you want to build a more stable circuit you should really be taking noise feedback into account during the building process PERIOD More importantly we even created a set of tools so other teams could conduct their own noise measurements. this research could potentially help scientists and doctors create betterintegrated medical apparatuses such as prosthetics bionic limbs and synthetic organs PERIOD

Another member of the Colleges iGEM team John Marken  spoke about the teams  project which researched biological circuits specifically genetic circuits PERIOD

We really wanted to see how far we could push these circuits without changing their base structure Marken said PERIOD

We really wanted to see how far we could push these circuits without changing their base structure Marken said PERIOD Instead of just taking one input and responding a single way afterwards the engineer would like to allow this cell to take in one input and respond in a variety of ways PERIOD The important aspect is that the original circuit remains unchanged allowing it to more effectively work with native circuits. like the work that Golino described this work in synthetic biology could allow for more sophisticated bionics and synthetic organs to be created and paired with people who need them PERIOD

Saha says this work from the iGEM team could make a difference in the lives of many people but she realizes that the science behind these developments can seem overwhelming PERIOD

Im always thinking about how I can get nonscience majors to really appreciate science Saha said PERIOD Not that theyll major in it but even if theyre going to maintain their careers in the social sciences or humanities to at least look at the New York Times articles that are scientific read Scientific American keep up and be informed voters about whats going on in science. saha said that this idea is only in the planning stages and that nothing is written in stone but she is excited to see where this idea moves in the future PERIOD

People need to know about this technology Saha said PERIOD What it could be used for what it shouldnt be used for what are the limits how it could be used to improve life and that this has been a goal for a long time PERIOD Life is something weve been curious about since humanity started. no solid plan is in place for the introduction of such a course but Saha said that she is hopeful that this idea will catch on with others at the College PERIOD
