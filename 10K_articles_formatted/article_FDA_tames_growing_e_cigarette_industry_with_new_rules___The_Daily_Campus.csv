8298,2023-10-25,"ecigarettes which some say are the safer alternative to smoking or a first step to kicking the habit are about to experience some serious changes due to the Food and Drug Administrations proposed regulations PERIOD

The sale of electronic cigarettes is smoking hot and is currently a  billion industry PERIOD Four years ago barely  percent of the U.S PERIOD population even knew what ecigarettes were PERIOD Today the vapor business has grown exponentially and continues to thrive PERIOD

According to Consumer Health Day between  and  the number of adolescents who had ever tried ecigarettes doubled PERIOD Those adolescents are now college students meaning that this generation is indulging the most in smoking ecigarettes and other vapor products PERIOD

Chip Paul CoFounder of Palm Beach Vapors the first franchising ecigarette and vapor retailer discussed the growth of his own business as well as the industry overall PERIOD

Founded in  Palm Beach Vapors is based out of Tulsa Okla PERIOD and has franchises in Oklahoma California Florida Texas Indiana Missouri and Alabama PERIOD The company has experienced exponential growth that reflects the countrys growing interest in ecigarettes and vapors or kicking the smoking habit PERIOD

Recently numerous communities in the DallasFort Worth area have placed more regulations on the growing industry putting more pressure on the need for federal regulation PERIOD

Because this product is so new theyre relatively unregulated PERIOD So far the products and the practice of smoking them otherwise known as vaping have avoided federal regulation PERIOD

Mitch Zeller the director of the Center for Tobacco Products referred to the current marketplace for ecigarettes the wild wild West due to the industrys lack of regulation PERIOD

According to Zeller there is no one vouching for the safety of these products PERIOD He claims there is no independent regulatory review of any claims made for the products PERIOD

The FDA is proposing to expand regulatory powers to ecigarettes as well as other popular products containing nicotine PERIOD

Paul says the FDA has had plans to create rules for the industry for some time PERIOD

Paul claims that the government agency was supposed to issue regulations last April PERIOD The announcement for regulations was rescheduled to a later date and was put off again for a second time PERIOD

The FDA unveiled plans April  to regulate ecigarettes for the first time as well as various other nicotine products PERIOD

This is a huge change for the industry because the FDA will have the authority to take critical actions that FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg claims will promote and protect the health of the public PERIOD

I think it is good regulations for the industry Paul said PERIOD This will help legitimize the industry by saying that we are a real vertical PERIOD Regulations are going to separate the real businessfocused responsible operators from the irresponsible operators. according to Paul before any regulations were in place anything could be put in the vapor that is used for ecigarettes PERIOD

A store could put anything in a bottle and sell it as vapor juice Paul commented PERIOD We are for regulation of liquid vapor PERIOD We accept our responsibility in this realm PERIOD We only use U.S PERIOD food grade products child proof caps and if anyone wants to know what is in our products we are happy to tell me. paul hopes that regulations will spur more studies on the longterm effects as well as the short term effects of vaping and smoking ecigarettes PERIOD

The true health consequences of ecigarettes are yet unknown but the three main ingredients of ecigarettes are nicotine flavoring and propylene glycol PERIOD

While some data suggests that nicotine can dangerously weaken the immune system flavoring is relatively harmless PERIOD The only wildcard is the propylene glycol used in most vapor products PERIOD

Propylene glycol is commonly seen in products such as soft drinks salad dressing shampoos and soaps PERIOD Good data about the safety of eating it or applying to the skin exists but the effects of inhaling the substance are not yet understood PERIOD

There are also some concerns that there could be cancercausing substances in the vapor and metals on the coils used inside of ecigarettes PERIOD

Pauls opinion differs from these unconfirmed concerns PERIOD He said that there is no question about vapor having less effects on the body than a 20year smoker PERIOD

People will tell you they feel healthier Paul said PERIOD They can do things they couldnt do when they were smoking real cigarettes PERIOD They can tell just by the feedback their bodies give them. paul commented that his company has a lot of customers that have quit smoking because of vaping PERIOD

Although Paul made it clear that his company doesnt sell to minors under any conditions and refuses to market to younger demographics he feels that it is far better for young people to vape than to smoke PERIOD

We will never market to the adolescent population but unfortunately other companies do Paul said PERIOD

The new regulations proposed by the FDA hope to change that PERIOD The FDAs rules hope to accomplish a lot of things mostly targeted at preventing kids from using them by banning the sale of ecigarettes to minors and give away of free ecigarettes as well as prohibiting the sales of ccigarettes in most
vending machines PERIOD

The FDA also plans to make ecigarettes carry warning labels that nicotine is addictive and force companies to disclose everything that is used to make their products PERIOD

It will compel the companies to tell us whats in the vapor and at what level so that we can do safety assessments Zeller said PERIOD We cant even tell you what is in the vapor today let alone what the risk profile of those various compounds are. the FDA also plans to ban any claims that ecigarettes are less dangerous than regular cigarettes without the agencys approval PERIOD

Public health advocates are glad about the new regulations as well according to NPRs All Things Considered PERIOD Some say that it has taken the FDA far too long to step in and regulate the industry and want the agency to take more action PERIOD
