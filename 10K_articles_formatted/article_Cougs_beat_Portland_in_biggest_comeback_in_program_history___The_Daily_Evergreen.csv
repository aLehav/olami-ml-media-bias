SAM TAYLOR Evergreen managing editorDecember  

WSU walked into the Rose City having only beaten the Portland Pilots once in  PERIOD

With  left in the first half it appeared that fact would remain true as the Cougars faced a 19point deficit PERIOD

The next  minutes of basketball contained the largest comeback in program history as WSU womens basketball  overcame that 19point deficit to beat the Portland Pilots   PERIOD

Following Ula Motugas headturning halfcourt3point shot the Cougs entered halftime with an 11point deficit PERIOD

After making only two shots in the first quarter on their way to a dismal  from the field the Cougs turned things around in the second quarter with a  field goal percentage PERIOD

A blistering hot third quarter saw WSU go 10for14 . and finally take the lead thanks to a  run PERIOD

Freshman Astera Tuhina came off the bench and provided  highenergy minutes including eight of her  points in the final two and a half minutes PERIOD

With less than  seconds remaining in the game and with WSU attempting to build on their twopoint lead the Cougs cashed in on a demonstration of offensive brilliance PERIOD Bella Murekatete appeared to dribble toward the basket in the post and ina split second her dribble became a pass securely in Tuhinas hands and through the basket PERIOD

Murekatetes sharp passing and quick hands cut through the Pilots lead PERIOD She scored  points with three assists and three rebounds PERIOD She also recorded a teamhigh six steals PERIOD

Charlisse LegerWalker collected three fouls in the first half and was contained to only  points PERIOD However she returned in the second half renewed and scored  points to finish the game with a 5for8 clip and a teamleading nine rebounds along with four assists and four steals of her own PERIOD

LegerWalker raised her doubledigit scoring streak to nine PERIOD

With her lone 3pointer of the night LegerWalker is now tied with Borislava Hristova for the 10thmost 3pointers in program history  PERIOD

Johanna Teder continues to take a high volume of 3pointers with moderate success PERIOD

She was 3for7 from beyond the arc as part of a 5for10 shooting night in which she scored  points PERIOD

After a slow start the Cougars yet again proved to be electric from the floor shooting . from the field and an even better . from beyond the arc PERIOD

On top of their dazzling shooting the Cougars were perfect from the freethrow line sinking all  of their shots PERIOD LegerWalker and Tuhina were each 4for4 under the spotlight of the freethrow line PERIOD

I thought we had great energy that came off the bench and Grace Sarver again and AT Tuhina again and I think Jo Teder got to the rim against that zone head coach Kamie Ethridgesaid PERIOD  I just thought our guards were really stood up and afraid to attack and penetrate and when they did a better job of that at least it gave us some hope heading into halftime. the Pilots shocked the Cougars early with their dizzying schemes PERIOD

They forced  turnovers on nine steals coming out of the gate physical but Wazzu was better down the stretch with  turnovers and  steals PERIOD

Alex Fowler led her team with  points and six rebounds PERIOD Maisie Burnham added  points and Lucy Cochrane scored  PERIOD

Portlands best efforts could not guard against the Cougars who outscored the Pilots4528 PERIOD

With Portland Oregon and nearby Vancouver being significant hubs for WSU alumni Cougar nation came out in full force and the team proudly sang the WSU fight song with their fans after the win PERIOD

Cougs Showed Out Tonight in the  City
