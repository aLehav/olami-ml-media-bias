Junior outside hitter Kara Bajema gets underneath the ball for a dig last season PERIOD

Its Week  of the college volleyball season and the No PERIOD  Washington volleyball team is still on the road PERIOD The Huskies have yet to play a home match and they wont until next week PERIOD

The mindset this week has mostly been centered around recovery for the athletes bodies and reconnecting as teammates head coach Keegan Cook said PERIOD The first two weekends took a huge effort traveling five time zones and playing five quality opponents on the road. the Huskies arent slowing down though PERIOD They packed in a few days of practice before heading out early on Thursday to Nebraska where No PERIOD  Creighton is waiting for them PERIOD

The Bluejays are a familiar foe for the Dawgs  they handed Washington an early season loss two years ago and the Huskies upset them in the tournament to head to the Sweet Sixteen last September PERIOD Like the Huskies they are a consistentlyranked tournamentcaliber team PERIOD This nonconference season theyre another in a long list of tough tests the Huskies have scheduled PERIOD

The Huskies bounced back from an early season loss to thenunranked Hawaii with the help of their defense PERIOD While Washington still isnt blocking like it wants to theres strong defense that isnt netfront PERIOD

Senior libero Shayne McPherson was a significant part of the defense this weekend with  digs across the two matches but sophomore setter Ella May Powell and senior hitter Kara Bajema were just as important PERIOD Powell had  digs in two matches and Bajema had  PERIOD

There has definitely been a commitment to improve our defense behind the block Cook said PERIOD The fifth set against Illinois really was won on four or five quality digs PERIOD Were still looking to improve that skill and combine it with the blocking performance we saw in week one. washington will play Drake at  p.m PERIOD Friday and will play a doubleheader against NebraskaOmaha at  a.m PERIOD and No PERIOD  Creighton at  p.m PERIOD Saturday PERIOD All three matches will be streamed by Creighton Athletics PERIOD
