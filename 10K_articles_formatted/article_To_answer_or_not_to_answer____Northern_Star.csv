Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Tyler VincentApril  

Before we begin this weeks observation a little note This column will not address the prosandcons of drugs nor will it deal with whether they should be legalized or not PERIOD Most of you who are reading this are set in your ways on this topic and nothing this or any column says will change your mind PERIOD

What this column will deal with is a drug policy that violates pure common sense PERIOD A policy that is counteractive to everything this country desires in a lawabiding citizen PERIOD It is something that warrants far more attention than the usual route Legalize it debates PERIOD Thus given the many complexities of this issue we will conduct our discussion under the premise that drugs are an illegal activity and those that partake of them require punishment PERIOD

OK Now onward PERIOD

Picture a young man PERIOD

In his formative years he hung around with the wrong crowd and among other things began using drugs PERIOD His academics began to suffer he got into a little trouble with the law and his life became not unlike that of a junkie PERIOD

One day this man for whatever reason including religious inspiration the intervention of family or friends or otherwise decides to kick the habit and pursue more socially accepted ways of living PERIOD He cleans up gets a job and decides to go for a college degree PERIOD

To help him with this he will need to apply for financial aid PERIOD But according to the Department of Education he will be unable to receive any funding PERIOD

This current round of Dubya nonsense comes in the form of the enforcement of a  ban on collegiate financial aid to those with drug records PERIOD The bill was proposed by former congressman Gerald Solomon RNew York and was passed in the form of the Higher Education Act which governs federal financial aid programs  the Bush Administration via the Department of Education

Under the Solomon policy those applying for financial aid will be subjected to the question Have you ever been convicted of selling or possessing drugs Answering in the affirmative or not answering at all will result in the rejection of financial aid PERIOD

Normally a person like the one mentioned above would be applauded in American society PERIOD He would be lauded with comments in the he picked himself up by the bootstraps vein PERIOD In most other circumstances people would want this person to get into college and better his chances for an acceptable career PERIOD

But this situation is not normal PERIOD This is the war on drugs. and in the war on drugs hypocrisy reigns especially given Dubyas unwillingness to disclose information on his drug history during last years campaign PERIOD Time and time again in his various pit stops he referred to his mistakes that he made in his youth and his hope that people wouldnt judge what he did back then as a reflection of who he is now PERIOD

How strange indeed then that this president who actively preached that his youthful indiscretions should not hinder him and his career at his current stage of life should allow active enforcement of the Solomon policy which would create a situation where others mistakes would have a direct impact on who they are at their current stage of life PERIOD It is also amazing given his regret over the errors of his youth that he does not seek to overturn this wretched policy PERIOD

After all Bush should be able to sympathize with the plight of the reformed who are trying to better themselves being that cocaine rumors aside he overcame the considerable obstacle of alcoholism to become president right

Well no PERIOD The current administration does not want to allow a reformed addict to think he can actually better himself PERIOD Let alone a recreational drug user PERIOD The liberal pundits online are giving their usual reaction that this piece of legislation will target poor and African American youths PERIOD These observations miss the point PERIOD The problem with this policy is the denial of redemption to the offender regardless of group or race which is the ultimate sin of the enforcement of this policy PERIOD

In cases like these justice must serve hand in hand with incentive PERIOD If society views drug use as harmful and wrong then it is imperative that the society counteract the negative aspects with positive ones PERIOD

In other words if everything told by the government on drugs is true then the opposite of the Solomon policy should happen PERIOD We should be setting up federal aid for former drug users PERIOD What good is encouraging a druggie to reform when we give him nothing to reform to

Even more alarming is the way the policy contracts traditional notions of American justice PERIOD Justice gives us punishment to offset the crime PERIOD Once that punishment is met by the individual he or she is free both in the literal and physical sense because the person owes no more debt to society PERIOD

Under this policy the punishment continues PERIOD The person cannot get into college and thus mistakes continue to affect his or her livelihood PERIOD And for the former drug user the penalty to society never will be paid fully PERIOD
