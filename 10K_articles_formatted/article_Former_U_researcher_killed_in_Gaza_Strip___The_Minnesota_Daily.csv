A former University researcher was killed by Palestinian gunmen Sunday morning in the Gaza Strip PERIOD

Baruch Zinger  was driving to pick up his son from an Israeli army base when the gunmen opened fire PERIOD He was a professor and researcher in electrochemistry and lived in the Israeli town of Gadera PERIOD

Zinger came to Minnesota in the early 1980s to perform postdoctoral research at the University and has returned multiple times since PERIOD

He basically had a second family here in Minnesota he really loved Minnesota said Walter Elias a friend of Zingers family since the early 1980s PERIOD They had a large circle of very close friends here and were all just appalled by the tragic events of the last few days. zinger had four children he was close to as well as a wonderful sense of humor and a love for music Elias said PERIOD

Leeor Kronik a postdoctoral associate in chemical engineering and material science did not meet Zinger until he came to Minnesota two years ago PERIOD A mutual friend in Israel urged him to call Zinger for help when he arrived PERIOD

Even though they didnt know me before that they just went out of their way to help me in everything and anything Kronik said of Zinger and his wife Nurit PERIOD They just did everything for me they were amazing. haaretz an Israeli newspaper reported two gunmen opened fire on traffic hitting Zingers jeep PERIOD Zinger made a call to his wife and then his son Oded PERIOD His son was reportedly the commander of the tank that killed the gunmen PERIOD

Zinger was always in favor of peace between the Palestinians and Israelis and the conflict between the two saddened him said Larry Miller a chemistry professor who worked with Zinger PERIOD

Its a terrible thing altogether for all people who are involved in terrorism around the world us included said Miller PERIOD For him to be such a peaceful person and really hoping always to have the problem solved in a peaceful way it makes it especially difficult. a private memorial service for friends and acquaintances in Minnesota is planned for Saturday PERIOD
