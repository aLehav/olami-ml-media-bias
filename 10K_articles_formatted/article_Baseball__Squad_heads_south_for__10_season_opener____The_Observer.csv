Chris Masoud  Friday February  

As the Irish lace up the cleats for the  season opener against Mississippi Valley State this weekend the ultimate goal in the back of their minds will be a bid to the College World Series PERIOD Fourthyear Irish coach Dave Schrage says thats exactly where a trip to Omaha should be the very back of his players minds PERIOD

I know its clich but weve just been focusing on getting better every day and trying to be the best team we can be Schrage said PERIOD Weve been through January and we told our guys we dont want to talk about Mississippi Valley or Omaha or winning the Big East PERIOD We want to talk about getting better every day. notre Dame has made significant strides over the past two seasons improving its win total steadily from  in  to  in  PERIOD The years team features  returning position players and  pitchers an asset Schrage believes will be invaluable early in the season PERIOD

Nevertheless Notre Dame lost two of its most productive hitters in outfielder A.J PERIOD Pollock and shortstop Jeremy Barnes to the MLB draft last May PERIOD

Pollock and Barnes combined for  home runs and  RBIs but senior captain and designated hitter Ryan Connolly is confident the teams balance will be enough to fill the void PERIOD

We just need to be more consistent PERIOD I think we have the potential this year instead of having two guys hit  to  home runs and drive in  runs we can have six or seven guys hit five to seven home runs and still drive in runs PERIOD We have a different dynamic and I think it will make us a different team to play against. led by Connolly and junior captain Mick Doyle Schrage believes the Irish are more than capable of handling the best the Big East has to offer PERIOD

No question about it you have to play to your personnel Schrage said PERIOD I think were going to be more of a manufactureruns type team PERIOD Weve been working a lot on hitting and running and running and hitting PERIOD We have to be more aggressive on the base paths PERIOD Weve got a little bit less power so you have to make up for it with base running. the Irish will rely heavily on the experience and depth of the pitching staff to keep them in close games PERIOD Junior captain Cole Johnson who led the team with . innings pitched and  strikeouts in  returns as the Irish ace PERIOD Schrage will use a rotation of Johnson senior Eric Maust junior captain Brian Dupra and freshman Steve Sabatino each of whom can pitch deep into games PERIOD

Its going to be a bit more balanced Schrage said PERIOD Were coming in with a lot of confidence with four starting pitchers right now and at the end of games were really going to need our bullpen PERIOD They can take a little bit of pressure off of our starting staff. the Irish hope the biggest improvement from  will be the ability to win consistently on the road PERIOD Notre Dame finished  away from Eck Stadium a trend Schrage says he would like to reverse when the Irish open the season Friday with a threegame series against the Delta Devils PERIOD

When you play on the road you have to be a lot more mentally tough Schrage said PERIOD You have to overcome a lot of the obstacles on the road PERIOD Any sport its tough to win on the road but good teams find a way to get it done. share This Story

The Irish will get a tough test this weekend when they face No PERIOD .. PERIOD
