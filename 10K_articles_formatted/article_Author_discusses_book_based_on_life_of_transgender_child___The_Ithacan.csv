Contributing Writer Noa Covell spoke with Herthel about the creation of her book the ban in Wisconsin and what she hopes children take away from the book PERIOD

This interview has been edited for length and clarity PERIOD



Noa Covell What drove you to write about this topic with this specific person

Jessica Herthel So I tried to get more involved in my local school district to get them to include more diverse family portrayals in their elementary school curriculum PERIOD And through that work I ended up meeting Jazzs mom and she and I became friends PERIOD Eventually we did this experiment of introducing my three girls to Jazz by all going out to ice cream and it was a total nonevent for my daughters PERIOD They all thought she was so beautiful and so cool and couldnt stop talking about her and I called Jazzs mom Jeanette the next day and said why wasnt there a tool for someone like me who just wants my kids to know how to be a compassionate friend and that we really need more tools for people who just want to be allies PERIOD So then Jeannette said that Weve always wanted to write a book but we dont know how and I said I also dont know how but lets figure it out. nC From the experience of writing this book and the events that followed afterward how have you grown as a writer and as a person

JH It turned me into an advocate PERIOD I never would have known when I was going to be a corporate lawyer that I would one day end up speaking in elementary schools PERIOD The fortune of this book presenting itself at the time that it did and the publisher taking a chance on us gave me the opportunity as an ally to put myself into situations that can be painful PERIOD I feel like its given me the opportunity to kind of be a bridge between kids like Jazz and communities that just dont understand them at all and to be able to explain why I think the best thing we can do for our kids is equip them with the knowledge and the tools to be kind to each other PERIOD



NC What kind of challenges or obstacles did you have to face both with the public as well as in your own writing How do you try to overcome them

JH I think my philosophy writing the book was that if we didnt ruffle some feathers then we werent doing it right because we didnt want this to just be a book that was so benign that no one really took notice of it PERIOD We wanted it to make a splash PERIOD We knew that we would be making some people upset PERIOD So what Ive tried to do is have as many facetoface interactions as possible and try to let everyone know that Im willing to listen and really try to articulate your concerns.And then hopefully youll give me the opportunity to tell you where maybe we could do better PERIOD



NC Is there anything you want to tell readers before they read the book

JH What I would say to people is that this is not a book that you have to do a lot of preparation or tell your kids Were going to have a serious conversation or say This might be scary for you. theres nothing scary about the book and the more we can normalize these kinds of stories the better off these kids are whether theyre trans kids or not in going out into the world and feeling like theyre all equal PERIOD We want all kids to feel like theyre equally entitled to safety security and love PERIOD



NC How do you view the situation surrounding your book in Wisconsin

JH The Wisconsin book banning that happened at this little elementary school really was the catalyst for so much of what has happened since then in terms of the book being supported by the Human Rights Campaign and them doing annual readings of the book PERIOD The small village in Wisconsin could have turned their back on this transgender 6yearold PERIOD But instead of that happening the community said No if youre not going to read the book at school were going to read it in the public library. they expected  or  people to show up but  people showed up PERIOD The fact that it was so overwhelmingly positive had served as a model that the Human Rights Campaign has sought to recreate around the country PERIOD
