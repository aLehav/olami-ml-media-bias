Myths about the aging brain revealed

ARA  Who says you cant teach a mind new tricks at any age

top healthrelated concerns of aging populations and has been
identified by the Centers for Disease Control as a public health
priority PERIOD

 says Dr PERIOD Majid Fotuhi a leading
neurologist and author of  

Dr PERIOD Fotuhi debunks four common myths surrounding the brain and
aging PERIOD

 PERIOD The brain stops growing after childhood PERIOD

A decade ago many experts would have scoffed at the idea that
the brains of adults particularly older adults could grow or
develop in any significant way PERIOD But that has changed PERIOD Research
increasingly suggests that each time a new skill is learned such
as playing an instrument speaking a foreign language or even
dancing new pathways are formed and areas of the brain may grow
even well into the later years PERIOD Physical and mental exercise can
alter specific brain regions improving in cognitive function PERIOD
Brain growth isnt just for kids PERIOD

 PERIOD Once I start experiencing memory loss its all downhill and
theres not much I can do PERIOD

Actually there are a number of things you can do to improve
your memory throughout life even if you are already noticing
changes PERIOD Exercise challenging mental activities social engagement
and diet adjustments have all been shown to have positive effects
on cognition and memory PERIOD In fact a new study published online in
May in Alzheimers  Dementia The Journal of the Alzheimers
Association showed that healthy people with memory complaints who
took algal DHA
capsules for six months had almost double the reduction in errors
on a test that measures learning and memory performance versus
those who took a placebo a benefit roughly equivalent to having
the learning and memory skills of someone three years younger PERIOD
DHA or
docosahexaenoic acid is an omega3 fatty acid and a building block
for the brain PERIOD Algal DHA products comparable to those used in this
study can be found at major retailers like Walmart CVS and
Walgreens under the Algal900 product name  look for the lifesDHA
seal on these supplements to ensure you are getting an algal DHA
source PERIOD For more information on foods beverages and supplements
that contain algal DHA visit www.lifesdha.com PERIOD

 PERIOD Memory problems must mean Alzheimers disease PERIOD

Many people young or old worry that mild forgetfulness must be
a sign of Alzheimers disease PERIOD But most people are worrying
needlessly  research shows that more than  percent of people
will never get Alzheimers disease PERIOD Some experts now believe that
it is time to redefine everyones understanding of agerelated
memory loss and dementia PERIOD Emerging research indicates that many
people experiencing memory loss and dementia actually have mixed
pathologies in their brains PERIOD In fact very few senior citizens have
 Instead latelife cognitive impairment
may in fact be a result of multiple  to the brain from a
variety of risk factors such as hypertension obesity sedentary
lifestyle chronic stress head trauma and poor diet PERIOD The good
news There is the opportunity to influence brain health and
function by incorporating lifestyle factors like exercise a
healthy diet stress reduction and intellectual and social
engagement PERIOD Regardless of family history the choices a person
makes in life may be able to slow the progression of agerelated
cognitive decline or help prevent it altogether PERIOD

 PERIOD Brightest equals youngest PERIOD

Todays society does place an emphasis on age but keep in mind
people over  rule the country PERIOD The majority of legislators CEOs
doctors lawyers judges economists and CEOs are not in their 30s
or 40s but seasoned veterans who bestow several decades of
experience and expertise PERIOD Along with gray hairs come both knowledge
and wisdom and you do not have to look far to find inspiring
stories of accomplishment creativity and reinvention in the second
half of life PERIOD To see some inspiring profiles of aging and learn
more about the actions you can take to ensure that you build and
