7671,2000-04-11,"activists do more than protest at Johnson Hall

Thank you Jeremy Lang for producing a mostly balanced update of the issues surrounding last years protest  Old issues new strategies ODE April  PERIOD Yet I am compelled to remark that the Emerald resembling most University students I have encountered still lacks much more than a Mason Westian understanding of activism see Wests column in the April   Emerald PERIOD

By focusing only on the most visible and radical activists you deny the prolonged behindthescenes work of those who use different tactics in different situations PERIOD Hundreds of students faculty and staff on this campus have been working for years to make the University more diverse to stop racism to end sexism to win fair contracts to make the campus safer to hold our representatives responsible to register people to vote and many other underreported efforts PERIOD So please dont say activism has been in a slump since last year. this is not to excuse the countless students on the political left who have verbally bludgeoned me and others for the tactics we used PERIOD I wont apologize for the events of last year PERIOD Without the Human Rights Alliance there would have been no discussion of sweatshops on this campus  bottom line PERIOD

All of us working against oppression and exploitation need to work together to create a better society PERIOD Divide and conquer is an old and very effective strategy PERIOD Those who seek to oppress and exploit now only have to focus on the latter we divide ourselves PERIOD
