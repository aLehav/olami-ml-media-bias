The complaint alleges that Columbia provided CAU with access to work mailboxes of union members enabling them to place promotional materials inside them attempted to fill a parttime teaching position through CAUa position that would normally be brought to PFac exclusively gave CAU access to PFac email addresses provided valuable media coverage of CAU in The Chronicle unilaterally recognized this group as PFac members despite objection from the union and assigned them work under the unions jurisdiction. jim Nagle an adjunct professor in the English Department member of PFac and member of CAU said not only is the Oct PERIOD  lawsuit frivolous but his group does not have any involvement with the hiring of parttime positions and the college did not encourage or facilitate the use of faculty mailboxes and emails PERIOD

According to the complaint the alleged support CAU received from the college has created influence that could possibly undermine PFacsstatus as the only recognized adjunct union at the college. this influence included creating support for a possible political campaign to decertify PFac in the future promoting a slate of candidates in PFac officer elections and influencing the political will and agenda of PFac and its members as well as that of other employees the lawsuit states PERIOD
Nagle said CAU is a caucus within the union not a separate union PERIOD Because of this he said this is not a labor dispute and it is untrue the group is trying to represent parttime faculty. cAU does not seek to represent Columbia adjuncts Nagle said PERIOD Thats a falsehood PERIOD Its a falsehood PFac is circulating in an effort to discredit us PERIOD We just disagree with the current leadership of PFac not PFac itself. according to the allegations CAUs points of influence over other employees include a promise to restore relations with IEANEA PFacs former parent union from which it officially disaffiliated in early  as reported Jan PERIOD  by The Chronicle PERIOD The complaint also says CAU influences employees by saying it wants to resist demonizing all administrative actions. nagle said the caucus wants to promote healthy relations with the administration and board of trustees something he said PFac holds against the caucus PERIOD
PFac leadership makes it seem as if somehow we are in collusion with the board of trustees when all were saying is Lets just get along and stop these frivolous lawsuits and stupid complaints he said PERIOD
Because the CAU allegedly brought IEANEA members into PFac the filing states Columbia has provided parttime positions for IEANEA members and recognized them as PFac members PERIOD The positions given to those members according to the complaint have a value of . nagle said he does not know how PFac attorneys reached this figure adding anyone can hold an IEANEA membership and still be in PFac PERIOD
As reported Oct PERIOD  by The Chronicle PFacs Oct PERIOD  filing against the college alleges Columbia breached its contractual obligation by abruptly refusing to arbitrate with the union grievances brought on behalf of former adjunct professor Mary Seyfarth and current adjunct professor Iymen Chehade. according to the current PFac bargaining agreement union members can work through grievances through informal and formal resolutions in which arbitration is the final step PERIOD The issue can only be brought to that stage by the union if all formal steps have been attempted and failed PERIOD A similar provision was part of PFacs former contract which extended from . the grievances were filed on behalf of Chehade who teaches in the Humanities History  Social Sciences Department regarding the loss of a class and academic freedom and for former adjunct professor Seyfarth who was allegedly terminated abruptly according to the complaint. labor organizations have the right to sue their employer over contractual violations according to Section  of the Labor Management Relations Act. arbitration is binding according to the bargaining agreement but the Oct PERIOD  filing alleges that the collegewhich had participated in discussions regarding Chehade and Seyfarth throughout 2015notified PFac Sept PERIOD  that it refused to arbitrate and affirmed that position Oct PERIOD  allegedly citing the grievances were not timely. according to PFacs complaint the challenge of deciding whether a grievance is timely or not must be determined by an arbitrator PERIOD
The college is acting in bad faith and without legal basis in refusing to arbitrate these grievances the complaint states PERIOD
The filing said the alleged refusal comes after the college violated the National Labor Relations Act with actions such as unilateral changes and refusing to timely respond to information requests. these alleged violations were cited in the unions Vote of No Confidence as reported Oct PERIOD  by The Chronicle. refusal to arbitrate is part of a concerted plan to undermine PFac as the exclusive representative of parttime faculty at Columbia the filing stated PERIOD
According to both suits PFac wants the college to comply with arbitration and permanently cease providing any support to CAU as well as to grant any other relief that is warranted by law or equity. the Oct PERIOD  suit specifically requests Columbia compensate the union for any legal fees and pay the union punitive damages. cara Birch a spokeswoman for the college declined to comment on the colleges behalf regarding pending litigation PERIOD
