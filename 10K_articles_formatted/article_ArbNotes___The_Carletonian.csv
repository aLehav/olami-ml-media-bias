9036,2023-11-04,"t Carleton Its still winter outside PERIOD Although it might be wearing on you the winter is still a great time to get out and enjoy the Arb PERIOD When most people think of the Arb in winter their minds goes straight to skiing PERIOD Although this is a great way to get out and see the Arb I dont think youve truly experienced the Arb in winter until you explore it on a pair of snowshoes PERIOD Unlike Nordic skis snowshoes are not confined to the trails and this greater mobility allows you to experience the Arb in a totally different way PERIOD During the winter the brush and grass that usually makes sections of the Arb difficult to travel through have been tamed by the snow and the winter season PERIOD

This opens up a large portion of the Arb to further exploration and fun. specifically the low lying areas adjacent to the Cannon River really open up during the winter and make for some really interesting snowshoeing. this area is completely laced with animal tracks left behind by critters drinking at the river PERIOD

You can find the tracks of deer rabbits and pheasants just to name a few. the interior of prairies also take on a new quiet and solemn character that needs to be experienced in order to truly comprehend this time of year PERIOD

Finally snowshoes allow you to get a closer look at the birds that winter in the Arb PERIOD Look for RedBellied Woodpeckers pecking away at the trunks of mature trees in the forested sections of the Arb and BlackCapped Chickadees anywhere there is decent brush cover PERIOD Take some time during this midterm break and go explore the Arb on a pair of snowshoes PERIOD I promise you wont regret it PERIOD
