Where do we turn when primetime is full of suck All  other channels baby PERIOD

Whether youre partial to The Biography Channel on a slow Sunday afternoon or a Lifetime Original Movie on a lonely Friday night I think we can all agree nothing beats the random timeconsuming shows that are always there during our most boring times of need PERIOD And such variety Click  some bro lost millions to a chick with a straight flush PERIOD Click  anthropologists discover that Cleopatra met aliens PERIOD Click   minutes to make a wedding dress out of glitter PERIOD Click  hot girls gone wild PERIOD Click  Golden Girls gone wild PERIOD Heck you can even watch Hannah Montana if you want to Although we will judge you. instead of bombarding you with morals or content these shows let your mind wander free PERIOD I like to just leave the TV on in the background while I do pretty much everything from cooking to showering PERIOD Yes my electricity bill is atrocious but I also at any time can tune in and learn something PERIOD Like how bullfrogs hunt or why you shouldnt Botox your eyelids PERIOD Hey that little girl saved her best friend with the Heimlich maneuver she learned off SpongeBob. you cant tell me that wasnt a slap in the face of the public education system PERIOD

As I always tell people nothing says more about a person than what they will watch when theres nothing else on PERIOD If youre lying on the couch with your latest conquest for some postsex TV and he turns on the Weather Channel you know theres a problem PERIOD I am a Food Network and Travel Channel girl myself though I have been known to throw a little Animal Planet in my day PERIOD Most girls up the ante with some TLC and Bravo whereas guys often gravitate toward Spike MythBusters or ESPN1through188633 PERIOD Theres no end to the mlange of TV labels you can give to someone in order to identify their personality PERIOD For example if I said Shes such a MTVEABC Family you would know exactly what kind of a person were looking at here PERIOD Its like classifying a species PERIOD

So the next time youre at home bored watching whatever it is you watch consider what your random television choices say about you PERIOD Or dont you know if you watch something like QVC PERIOD In that case youre better off not knowing PERIOD
