Every spring SXSW blesses our little city with movies music and copious amounts of traffic PERIOD A lot of other stuff too PERIOD Many Austinites flee and thats understandable PERIOD Nothing can quite ease that twinge of pain when you see your favorite food truck swarmed by people from nothere PERIOD

But if youre looking to take staycation with a special someone SXSW has you covered PERIOD In many ways its pretty much ideal date material PERIOD That is if you dont mess it up PERIOD Here are my tips PERIOD

 PLAN PERIOD Then plan some more PERIOD The thing about SXSW is it literally has something for everyone and this can be a bit of a double edged sword PERIOD With so much stuff to do its easy to lose track of time and miss some seriously cool events PERIOD Research event times make a schedule and look at it periodically so nobody gets mad at you for missing the Wes Anderson movie PERIOD

 Compromise PERIOD This kind of goes hand in hand with planning PERIOD When youre doing SXSW with another person there will probably be things one of you wants to see that the other does not or vice versa PERIOD If potential schedules conflict it might be better for one of you to give in than to split up and see different things PERIOD That way the other person can never claim that you ditched them and you get brownie points for being selfless and mature and great PERIOD

 Embrace the free PERIOD SXSW is not the time to blow someone away with expensive dinners and dates PERIOD The frequency with which you will encounter free food events tshirts and other random crap is ridiculous PERIOD I for one would take free kimchi fries over fancy tiny gourmet sushi any day PERIOD

 Embrace the crowds PERIOD I know I know PERIOD Crowded streets are largely considered the bane of SXSW or any big event that comes to Austin PERIOD But crowded things are crowded for a reason because other people find that thing cool tooand theres really no way around it if you want to see anything worthwhile PERIOD So yeah maybe itll take you  minutes to move two blocks PERIOD Maybe youll have to stand in a line for literally everything PERIOD But a little chillness can go a long wayinstead of complaining about the obvious think of it as simply more time to hang out with your date Ask them their favorite color PERIOD Play I Spy. make elaborate dramas using your hands as puppets PERIOD Whatever gets you by PERIOD

 Get excited Nobody likes That Guy at festivals the one who stands around looking totally nonplussed even as hes surrounded by awesome things PERIOD One time at ACL I asked one of Those Guys why he wasnt more excited and he responded with Well I live here so. i dont really know where that assumption startedthat if youre a real Austinite its somehow uncool to get excited about celebrities and movies and music and exhibitions coming here PERIOD Your date will not think youre super laid back and cool if you pretend not to care about anything PERIOD They will think you are a primitive operating system incapable of feeling PERIOD So consider this your license to squeal with glee upon entering the Game of Thrones exhibitI promise itll be good for your relationship PERIOD
