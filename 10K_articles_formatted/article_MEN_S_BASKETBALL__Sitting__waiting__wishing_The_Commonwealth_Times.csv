UNC Wilmington is off to the big dance after winning the Colonial Athletic Association Tournament PERIOD  There is buzz around conference big wigs about George Mason and Hofstras hopes of madness in March PERIOD  But what about VCU

After backtoback postseason bids to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament and National Invitation Tournament in the past two seasons the mens basketball finds itself in a state of limbo PERIOD

The Rams have no choice but to sit and wait to hear about their postseason future PERIOD  With the NCAA Tournament all but out of the picture the Rams are on the bubble for a chance at NIT glory PERIOD

Last year when we lost the championship we knew we were going to the NIT coach Jeff Capel said after the CAA Tournament loss to Hofstra March  PERIOD  This year its a little bit different PERIOD  We dont know PERIOD  Well be sitting anticipating and hoping PERIOD  Well see what happens. for the first time since  when Richmond won an atlarge bid and Navy was conference champion the conference is likely to have at least two bids to the NCAA Tournament which ultimately decides the national champion PERIOD  In previous seasons the only way for a CAA team to get to the tourney was to win the conference championship as VCU did in  PERIOD

The other way to make it in is for the NCAA to decide if a team is worthy of an atlarge bid which enters a team that hasnt won their conference championship but is considered eligible based on their record Ratings Percentage Index strength of schedule and other factors PERIOD  The NIT which the Rams hope to enter is a consolation bracket for those who didnt make the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

When asked if he had a guess at the teams possibilities for a postseason bid to the NIT Capel said he hopes the CAAs success this season would boost their chances PERIOD

Who knows he said PERIOD  If you look at it there has been a lot of talk about our league this year and how good our league is and its not just talk its true I think we definitely have two teams into the NCAA tournament this year and hopefully were able to get four teams into the NIT and hopefully were one of those teams. the Rams finished the regular season with a  overall record and sixth in the CAA behind Old Dominion and Northeastern with an  conference record PERIOD  George Mason and Hofstras chances at atlarge bids to the big dance look relatively strong with RPIs of  and  respectively PERIOD  With VCUs RPI at  as of March  Capel said they are in the typical range of NIT selections in past seasons PERIOD

If you look historically teams that are around there usually get a bid he said PERIOD

If the Rams does not make a bid however Capel said he wants to see some extra effort from certain players to improve their game PERIOD

If our season is over with he said there are a lot of guys who have a lot of work to do to become better basketball players Its going to be an interesting thing to see who really is committed to doing that. elsewhere in the world of sports
