ElklandGoldenColumbia RecordsElkland showed little promise on their first EP Apart PERIOD Needless to say the group delivers another heartless collection of songs on their fulllength Golden PERIOD Gardenvariety melodies and pompous but feeble instrumentation cause this record to fall short in all musical aspects.Not only does Golden lack catchy lines and insightful lyrics  the album clearly parrots its contemporaries PERIOD The melody of Its Not Your Fault is easily recognizable as that from the Postal Services Such Great Heights. vocal shortcomings along with generic guitar and keyboard riffs destroy any hope for this group of amateurs.The group shows their inexperience again with the inclusion of Put Your Hand Over Mine the first song ever written by the bands frontman PERIOD The track might hold sentimental value for the group but it only maintains the palate of bland pop songs PERIOD Every Time You Tell Me That You Love Me admittedly Elklands boldest track shows potential before degenerating into droning unwavering vocals and predictably trite keyboard lines PERIOD

Elkland tries to imitate their postpunk idols PERIOD While the band may feel theyve obtained that sound on Golden its obvious that their music fails to honor the legacy and haunting quality of their heroes PERIOD Rating one star PERIOD
