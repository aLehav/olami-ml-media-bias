Glynn Watson Jr PERIOD center stands with family during the Senior Day ceremony at Pinnacle Bank Arena on Sunday March   in Lincoln Nebraska PERIOD

Two years prior it was hard envisioning Nebraska basketball having a senior day like 2019s any time soon PERIOD

Four players transferred from the team and the foundation to Tim Miles program appeared to be rotting after a thirdstraight losing season PERIOD

Fast forward to now and a completely different group of seniors transformed the program and ended the regular season portion of their careers with an incredible 16point second half comeback over Iowa PERIOD

Everything about it was improbable and unbelievable PERIOD

Everything about it was for the teams seniors who showed their impact will last longer than however long their stay lasted in Lincoln PERIOD

Three of Nebraskas five seniors got to start inthe home finale PERIOD All five one way or another had a say in how the game turned out PERIOD

Trailing by  early in the second half it was a junior in a seniors jersey who broke Nebraska out of a  Iowa run PERIOD Forward Isaiah Roby made one of a careerbest four threepointers to wake his team up all while wearing senior forward Isaac Copeland Jr.s No PERIOD  jersey PERIOD

SeniorIsaac Copeland Jr PERIOD stands with family during the senior day ceremony at Pinnacle Bank Arena on Sunday March   in Lincoln Nebraska PERIOD

Before the game Copeland told reporters there was no one else hed rather have honoring him that way PERIOD

Thats great Copeland said about the gesture PERIOD Thats my son I raised him well PERIOD Out of everybody Im glad that hes the one doing it PERIOD Plus they always got us confused at times. coming to Nebraska as a former 5star high school recruit turned transfer from Georgetown Copeland overcame a serious back injury and led Nebraska to a  season as a junior while averaging  points per game PERIOD After testing the waters of the NBA Draft he ultimately decided to return for his senior season to try and improve his draft stock PERIOD

That plan was working as he averaged  points and five rebounds per game this season before he landed awkwardly after going up for a dunk after the whistle against Ohio State and tore his ACL ending his collegiate career PERIOD

Suddenly one of Nebraskas biggest scoring threats was gone and the team went  in his absence PERIOD

I came here I did what I wanted to do I got better and I grew as a person Copeland said about his Nebraska career PERIOD I think I made this program better so Im happy with that PERIOD As far as being injured Ive been very positive and moving on to the next step. injury and all he said he had no regrets returning for his senior season PERIOD

Making history is hard Copeland said PERIOD A lot of people want to do it and think they can do it but its still really hard. as No PERIOD  set the tone for a comeback in the second half an even more unlikely source continued the momentum PERIOD

Senior walkon guard Johnny Trueblood knew he would get some playing time in his final home game but nobody on the team thought he would play  minutes PERIOD To put that in context he had played just  minutes total in the previous  games of the season PERIOD Thats also  minutes more than he played all of last season PERIOD

SeniorJohnny Trueblood stands with family during the senior day ceremony at Pinnacle Bank Arena on Sunday March   in Lincoln Nebraska PERIOD

Im not going to lie nobody saw that coming Roby said after the win PERIOD Johnnys a good player PERIOD In practice hes had some days where hes been on scout team and killed the starting five. trueblood never intended to play meaningful minutes at Nebraska PERIOD After a brief hiatus from the team two years ago he decided to return and focus on preparing for a coaching career PERIOD Down to seven active scholarship players on Sunday he had no choice but to step into a bigger role PERIOD

That role was a statsheet filling game where he finished with six rebounds four assists and two steals PERIOD Out of all the players in the game the largest point differential was Truebloods at  points PERIOD

I knew we were going to play him and I wanted to get him in earlier rather than later Miles said PERIOD He played with such good poise and I think thats what Im most proud about PERIOD Hes really got courage and bravery and even a little bit of daring. as for what hes learned in preparation for going into coaching Trueblood said he has learned a ton. you learn the ins and outs of all this stuff all the little things you need to do that you dont see unless youre behind the scenes he said before the game on Friday PERIOD Its been a blessing to see what they do and see how I can learn from that and move that into my career. do other players on the team see his potential as a coach Roby said he definitely can PERIOD

Johnny is the type of guy that tries to do the right thing all the time he said PERIOD If he messes up he knows he messes up PERIOD He has that kind of respect from our coaches and I think hed be a good coach down the road. likewise to Trueblood senior center Tanner Borchardt also returned from a hiatus halfway through  albeit more due to depth concerns rather than coaching interest PERIOD

That decision led to a scholarship in  and a starting spot after Copelands injury this season PERIOD In that new role Borchard scored  points and grabbed  rebounds in a loss at Illinois in early February PERIOD

On Sunday Borchardt was the lone senior to foul out PERIOD He committed his fifth foul seconds before Nebraskas furious finalminute run began but not before he finished with eight points and eight rebounds PERIOD

With Borchardt out Nebraskas two star senior guards stepped up PERIOD James Palmer Jr PERIOD started Nebraskas rally with a three then Glynn Watson Jr PERIOD followed with one of his own PERIOD The two combined to make five threes in the final minute and Palmer powered his way through Iowas defense for a layup that tied the game in the final seconds of regulation PERIOD

By the time the final buzzer of overtime sounded two of the most prolific scorers in program history had combined to score  points in the win PERIOD Watson Jr. the lone fouryear player in the class made seven threes in the game PERIOD

SeniorJames Palmer Jr PERIOD stands with family during the senior day ceremony at Pinnacle Bank Arena on Sunday March   in Lincoln Nebraska PERIOD

As a senior I never thought we were going to lose the game Palmer said afterwards PERIOD Even when we were down by nine I still thought we had a chance to win it PERIOD Me and Glynn had to make some big shots. it was big Watson said about the win PERIOD I just loved playing here for my four years in Nebraska PERIOD It will give us confidence going into the Big Ten Tournament. nebraskas seniors have had plenty to say both before and after Sundays game but it was something freshman forward Amir Harris said just minutes after hitting the gamewinning layup that struck the loudest chord about this group PERIOD

Im just going to say that these guys really do a lot that goes unnoticed Harris said about his senior teammates PERIOD A lot of people say we dont have a vocal leader these guys lead by example PERIOD People dont see behind the scenes that when I was struggling James pulled me aside and told me to move on from my missed layups and keep playing and keep on moving on PERIOD Gs telling me to focus on my next shot and my next play to get a big stop PERIOD These guys deserve a lot of credit for that. barring a miraculous run in the Big Ten Tournament next week Nebraskas senior class will fall short of their ultimate goal of winning an NCAA Tournament game PERIOD No matter who the coach is come next season the job they did improving Nebraskas brand over the past two seasons showed PERIOD This group raised expectations both inside and outside of the program nnd that will pay dividends tenfold for the Huskers in the coming years PERIOD

This group has been a special group Miles said about his seniors PERIOD I really think what theyve done is allowed Nebraska to be more relevant nationally PERIOD Although we didnt reach our goals this year so far theyve really allowed for that PERIOD

I still think we have a long way to go as a program Copeland said on Friday PERIOD Basketball here isnt getting the respect from everybody around us PERIOD We have a good group of fans but as soon as things go wrong they go Ohh here we go again. if youre a good program that doesnt happen as often PERIOD We made some strides. comments like that havent been said by players ever before at Nebraska PERIOD After years of apathy the bar is starting to get higher in Lincoln PERIOD
