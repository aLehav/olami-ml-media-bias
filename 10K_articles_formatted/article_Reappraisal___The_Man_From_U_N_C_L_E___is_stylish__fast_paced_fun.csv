In  director Guy Ritchie King Arthur Legend of the Sword released The Man From U.N.C.L.E. a Cold War spy caper featuring Henry Cavill Batman vs PERIOD Superman Dawn of Justice Alicia Vikander Submergence and Armie Hammer Call Me By Your Name as a motley crew of international spies hunting for a missing warhead PERIOD The film seemed to be one nobody had asked for adapted from a lowbrow  television series of the same name PERIOD Whats more it opened just weeks after spymovie blockbuster Mission Impossible Rogue Nation. as a result ticket sales were less than spectacular PERIOD With tepid critical reviews the film came and went as little more than a blip on the  summer movie radar PERIOD Today the film remains one of the most underrated spy films to come out of the last decade featuring dazzling stylization irresistible cast chemistry and an electrifying soundtrack PERIOD

The spy flick was once a pillar of popular cinema Filled with suave machismo high fashion and exorbitant amounts of innuendo the style of the classic spy movie is a cultural icon PERIOD Today they dont make spy movies like they used to box offices are dominated by dark gritty films like The Bourne series and even the oncecampy James Bond films now boast sleek bluetinted color palettes PERIOD

The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is an homage to a bygone era of film PERIOD It doesnt concern itself with deep troubled backstories or a dark moody aesthetic PERIOD The film meticulously recreates the style of the classic spy film from its splitscreen action sequences to its dramatic camera zooms PERIOD The film revels in this campy carefree style with just enough modern flair to not feel dated PERIOD Critics panned the film for prioritizing style over substance which it did PERIOD However positing that criticism of this kind of film is like comparing Dr PERIOD Pepper to fine wine PERIOD The film wasnt made to be deep  it was made to be stylish and fun a goal it achieves in spades PERIOD

The casts chemistry too stands out as a highlight of the film that was largely overlooked by critics PERIOD Each of the main characters is likeable on their own from Cavills suave Napoleon Solo to Hammers stalwart Illya Kuryakin to Vikanders charming Gaby PERIOD Together however these three feed off of one another and create a cast dynamic thats downright irresistible PERIOD The characters all serve as excellent foils for one another such as in a scene where Illya sits in a hotel room and quietly plays chess with himself trying and failing to ignore Gaby drunkenly dancing to Solomon Burkes Cry to Me. the interactions between the films main characters are repeatedly grininducing and theyre part of what makes the film as much fun as it is PERIOD

Speaking of Cry to Me did I mention that this soundtrack is incredible Because it is PERIOD Not only does the film sample numerous 60s Italian pop classics including one particularly memorable scene featuring Peppino Gagliardis Che Vuole Questa Musica Stasera but it also contains numerous standout original compositions PERIOD A large virtue of these original compositions  composed by Daniel Pemberton  is how well they fit the action taking place on the screen PERIOD For example during a car chase the engines may rev in unison with ripping electric guitar riffs or the cars may bounce along a dirt trail to the beat of the soundtrack piece PERIOD This synchronization is subtle but it lends the film a unique cadence thats all its own PERIOD

It may not be a dramatic masterwork but from my first viewing of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. back in  I knew the film was significant as a tribute to the golden age of onscreen espionage and all the bravado style and campiness that came with it PERIOD Its absolutely an imperfect film and not one Id ever try to pretend is flawless but those flaws rarely seem to impact the experience of watching the film PERIOD Instead The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is the type of cinematic experience that thrills and entertains for every second of its  minutes PERIOD
