Spinnaker Record Club is a weekly selection of music releases designed to introduce students to sounds they may not find elsewhere PERIOD

Every so often a band comes along that tries to slap us out of our complacent conditioned firstworld lives PERIOD We had Talking Heads in the 80s Nirvana in the 90s Modest Mouse until they went corporate and now in the middle of our highly commercialized decade we have Ought who made the best album of last year and the best song of this one PERIOD

That song is called Beautiful Blue Sky and it is the centerpiece of their new album Sun Coming Down PERIOD Like David Byrne on Once in a Lifetime vocalist Tim Beeler Darcy whose voice combines the expressiveness of Thom Yorke and David Bowie with Byrnes sense of irony refrains from singing and opts instead to tell it like it is PERIOD He gives us a view out his window and what he sees is grim Warplane condo oil freighter new development. he follows up with a barrage of idiotic smalltalk greetings Hows the family hows the family fancy seeing you here fancy seeing you here. none of these greetings mean anything or indicate that we care about each other PERIOD Maybe they did once but now theyre all about going through the motions all while new developments and oil freighters suck the land dry PERIOD We put all our energy into empty words and shallow socialization that we ignore the world around us fail to see that its being destroyed until all thats left is the petty talk  Just that and the big beautiful blue sky. ought who formed at Montreals McGill University amidst the Maple Spring student movement against tuition hikes have advocated this way of thinking since their formation and especially since releasing their album More than Any Other Day last year PERIOD That albums experimental bent and articulated sense of confusion with our time solidified it as one of the best debuts any rock band has released I even prefer it to Arcade Fires Funeral PERIOD Sun Coming Down doesnt attempt to keep up the vibe PERIOD It emphasizes songcraft over LP structure as its octet of post punk tunes could seemingly go in any order PERIOD Its advantage over the first album however is that the band knows what they want to say and make delivering the message a priority PERIOD

Sun Coming Down wants you to know that the world youre dancing around in is deeply flawed PERIOD Beautiful Blue Sky is the clearest articulation of this but the rest of the albums songs are just as brutal profound and enjoyable PERIOD Passionate Turn tells us to accept that our dreams may be broken that we may never reach the perfect room we imagine ourselves living in PERIOD All the while it warns us of the devastating effects conformity may work upon us loneliness hopelessness abandoning love PERIOD Celebration is a hilarious cutting drag at emptyheaded consumerism and hedonism telling us not to lose ourselves in a haze of smoke and drink not to worry about abusing substances as a means of fitting in PERIOD And then theres energetic opener Men for Miles which I find myself clinging to in times of stress despite having yet to decipher it PERIOD

More than any other rock band currently working Ought wants to use their music to impact change and Sun Coming Down is their most refined expression yet PERIOD It proves that todays music can be more than entertainment have impact beyond the shallow ground of the musical landscape and because of that it may be the most crucial album of  PERIOD Douglas Markowitz

The most important preservation of The Front Bottoms style that lingers in Back on Top is sadness PERIOD These two guys still wallow in their failures breakups trashed living rooms and dumb friends in each song like they always have PERIOD

There is however a groundbreaking new aspect to this album that fans definitely did not expecta song about a normal healthy headoverheels relationship called 2YL. no one who knows the Front Bottoms thought this would ever happen but it seems as though our boys have found real love PERIOD They even express it with a cheesy saxophone solo PERIOD

Even so theyre still the same screwups PERIOD The track right after West Virginia is the most depressing heartbreak anthem of the year putting them right back to being hellbent on selfdestruction  the one thing we can count on them for PERIOD

Musically this album is confusing compared to previous albums PERIOD The Front Bottoms normally whine to tracks of a playful acoustic guitar and the occasional ring of a trumpet but this album crash lands in a place with mediocre electric guitars saxophones and mainstream alternative rhythms PERIOD

One track Historic Cemetery begins as a typical Front Bottoms stoner anthem but ends up tangled in a downright strange rap verse from GDP a hiphop artist the band did a split with in May of  PERIOD I had to check if the same song was still playing on my laptop and not one of those annoying online pop up ads PERIOD

The Front Bottoms have added on layers of production with each new release they put out after their first fickly named album from  that were not sure they even have a title for but we think its I Hate My Friends PERIOD From this stripped down spunky collection the band has evolved into a weird mix of themselves and everyone else they think they should be PERIOD

Upon first listen fans will be significantly disappointed PERIOD But Front Bottoms fans can be counted on to come for the sad and stay for the sad PERIOD As long as they are miserable The Front Bottoms will always have fans to cry to PERIOD Rachel Cazares

After listening to both their album Holding Hands With Jamie and its more concise EP equivalent The Early Years I can only confirm that the music of Girl Band  who like Women before them are all dudes  makes you want to fight people PERIOD I know not if this is their intent but I do know that all I want to do right now is pick up something heavy throw it and flex PERIOD

Very noisy dissonant music tends to have this effect PERIOD From hardcore punk to Death Grips to nu metal every generation has that one band that puts them in a pleasurably mindless violent state PERIOD Girl Band who come from Dublin may be filling that role for the moment PERIOD Certainly their guttural grinding fuzzedup guitar work skeletal unhinged drumming muscular bass and Dara Kielys whining atonal vocals dont make for a productive study hour PERIOD We cant really understand what the hell hes saying but you know hes angry or at the very least scornful and it makes us react appropriately PERIOD

None of this is a criticism PERIOD In fact its part of the appeal PERIOD Girl Band has taken the antagonistic sound of Big Black and early Swans and fused it with the catchiness of dancepunk and noise rock PERIOD Amidst the grinding whirring noise and pulsing beat our lizard brains take over PERIOD Thus it makes sense that theyre at their best at length when their poisonous brew has time to take over PERIOD Album centerpiece Paul takes nearly seven minutes to crescendo from a steady detuning bass line and drum affair into a cacophonous screeching squaw of fuzz and beats PERIOD Only the opener Umbongo and the similarly lengthy Fking Butter can compare PERIOD

Holding Hands With Jamie sounds like it was recorded in a cave by Neanderthalsscraping crude stone tools against the walls and Girl Band are like a halfwaydecent version of Death From Above  PERIOD Ultimately their album is a strong yet not a superb start for a band that has the talent to keep scratching our lizard brains for years to come PERIOD

Now if youll excuse me Im going to body slam into a parked car PERIOD DM

DJ Earl  Live Love TEKLIFE Short surprisereleased album of excellent soulful tunes reflecting on the Chicago producers recent travels PERIOD Those late to the game on footwork may want to peep as this is lowkey one of the genres best releases of the year PERIOD DM

Skylar Spence  Prom King This guy started out making mediocre apolitical vaporwave as Saint Pepsi before refining his style into the sampleheavy house variety known as future funk on Hit Vibes PERIOD PepsiCo ceaseanddesisted him into changing his pseudonym and now we have this debut album for Carpark who also represent the verysimilar Toro y Moi PERIOD Prom King retains much of what made Hit Vibes fun and interesting and tacks on some passable vocals with lyrics about nothing in particular PERIOD I expect it to be very popular on Tumblr PERIOD DM

. sailsSkylar Spence on Soundcloud

  Speaking of vaporwave heres a release that straddles the line between the sampleheavy genre and straightup ambient PERIOD Certainly sounds very pleasant and certainly better than much of the last two years of amateur genre imitators Skylar included but needs a little more conceptual depth to amount to anything else PERIOD Title translates to The Birth of a New Day. dM
