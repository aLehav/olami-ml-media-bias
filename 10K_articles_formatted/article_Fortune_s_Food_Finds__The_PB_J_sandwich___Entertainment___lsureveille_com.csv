This Fridays fortune is a meal that can be produced without any electricity or water PERIOD A meal that everyone knows and one that tastes best when cut in triangles for reasons unknown PERIOD With an average cost of fewer than  cents per sandwich here is the peanut butter and jelly sandwich PERIOD The jelly was replaced by jam in this instance PERIOD

Whole wheat bread is a course slightly bittertasting bread that not everyone is fond of PERIOD I enjoy the taste of whole wheat bread PERIOD It becomes a stronger part of the sandwich than it would be if it was white or honey wheat bread PERIOD Crunchy peanut butter has such a strong presence PERIOD Peanut fragments provide a new texture to the familiar taste of the thick creamy substance PERIOD No ingredient in the PBJ is more important than another but Strawberry Jam is the easy favorite PERIOD The sweet sticky spread with strawberry chunks was made for bread PERIOD A properly balanced PBJ will taste just as good the one thousandth time as it does the first PERIOD

I chose this sandwich because I was out of power for a few days like many others in this region PERIOD The PBJ carried me through this tough time when all my groceries went bad PERIOD It can be eaten anywhere at any time PERIOD Toasted bread is nice but it is not a necessity PERIOD There is nothing fancy about this sandwich PERIOD It tastes good and it fills you up PERIOD The PBJ sandwich is a legendary food PERIOD

Ingredients for this sandwich can be found almost everywhere food is sold PERIOD The only mistake you can make is buying the premixed peanut butter and jelly PERIOD
