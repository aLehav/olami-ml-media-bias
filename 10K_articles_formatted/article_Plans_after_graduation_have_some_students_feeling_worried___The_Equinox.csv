As the days until the dreaded gword seem to be flying by we as seniors are being forced to face situations and emotions that we may or may not be ready for PERIOD

While some are fortunate enough to already know their postgrad plans many seniors do not PERIOD

And not only is there an excessive amount of things to consider but it also seems to be the most frequent topic of conversation no matter where we go PERIOD

Ill even be the first to admit Im guilty of it  I ask other seniors if they know their future plans and ask recent graduates what theyve been up to PERIOD

The topic can be such a personal or stressful one yet it is simply unavoidable PERIOD

It may seem like our options are endless and looking at it optimistically they really could be PERIOD But with every option comes some drawbacks PERIOD

For example say the postgrad plan is grad school that means that this student must kick ass all semester gradewise and nail everything on both the application and the process itself such as studying fortaking the GREs revised General Tests getting accepted finding suitable housing and figuring out the logistics of tuition  do loans need to be taken out What about financial aid

Or lets say the plan doesnt include grad school PERIOD Do I want to live at home for a while Do I want to move out as soon as possible Could I even afford to move out if I wanted to What about finding a job

Do I want to work parttime at a few different places and save up for a while or do I want to jump right into a fulltime salary position

While it is said that the door to the real world is soon to be wide open for those of us about to graduate this is proving not to be the case PERIOD

According to a USA Today article from last May the Bureau of Labor Statistics data compiled by the EPI show that the unemployment rate for those under  is typically at least twice the national average because they are so new to the job market lack experience and may be the first let go when a company has to downsize in hard economic times. a Huffington Post article confirms this by stating The report from the Center for College Affordability and Productivity concludes that while collegeeducated Americans are less likely to collect unemployment many of the jobs they do have arent worth the price of their diplomas. so basically we spend all this time and money going to school just to enter the real world and be told we arent good enough to be doing what we actually want to do PERIOD
