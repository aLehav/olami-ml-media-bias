Recently a teaching assistant I had for a class decided to switch our Friday discussion section to Zoom because she had tested positive for COVID19 that Wednesday PERIOD

A full week later she made the section virtual again because even though she felt much better and by all accounts shouldnt have been contagious anymore she was still coughing a little bit. keep in mind that this was during the first few weeks of the semester when masks were still required in classes PERIOD

Both of those sections went as well as just about every Zoom class Ive ever had PERIOD Everyone in the class seemed miserable and no one was actively participating or paying attention PERIOD The flaws of the virtual classroom were especially noticeable because unlike my entire junior year when I had nothing to compare online classes to this semester all of my classes are in person PERIOD

For many students like me online classes are much harder to focus in PERIOD There are so many distractions that arent present in most classrooms whether it be in your home or on your computer PERIOD The lack of a divide between school and home makes it hard to mentally detach yourself from either PERIOD The vast majority of students including every student Ive spoken to got very little out of the classes they took over the past couple of years PERIOD This is evident in the massive learning loss students experienced across the world PERIOD As both anecdotes and studies tell us online classes are simply not an adequate substitute for inperson learning PERIOD

The decision to make the majority of classes virtual is predicated on the belief that inperson classes would be hotbeds for COVID19 transmission PERIOD The problem is theyre not PERIOD Every study thats been conducted on the subject has shown that inperson learning is not as dangerous as was earlier predicted PERIOD This has been common knowledge since the summer of  PERIOD Doctor Anthony Fauci who was known for being on the more riskaverse side throughout the pandemic has repeatedly endorsed inperson schooling stating that schools should be the last places to close and the first places to open PERIOD Even before vaccines were available the director of the CDC said hed absolutely be comfortable sending his grandkids to school PERIOD

In hindsight the move didnt even make sense from a logical standpoint PERIOD If stopping potential COVID19 outbreaks was so important to the University of Massachusetts why invite thousands of students onto campus who were likely to break social distancing rules the first chance they got Surely having hundreds of students living in the same dorm together poses a higher risk than masked students sitting a few feet apart from one another in a classroom for an hour PERIOD

Throughout the  academic year UMass required its students even those who lived off campus to get tested twice weekly PERIOD I remember being pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to reserve tests and get them done whenever I wanted during this time period PERIOD This of course proved to be extremely helpful at stopping outbreaks before they began PERIOD Even the largest COVID19 outbreak that UMass experienced died down after less than a week PERIOD

Simply put classrooms were safe even before vaccines were available and we had a testing apparatus that could nip any potential outbreak in the bud PERIOD I fail to see how throwing away an entire academic year was necessary PERIOD

Unfortunately the issues with making the majority of classes virtual go beyond it being unnecessary and inferior to inperson learning PERIOD Throughout the pandemic students in the United States faced an unprecedented mental health crisis PERIOD And no this wasnt due to the pandemic itself PERIOD Rather it was the monthslong deprivation of a social life an essential component of teenagers mental health PERIOD Online learning heavily contributed to this  why is that

In short we cant solely blame Zoom fatigue PERIOD A likely explanation is that online learning further eradicated what sociologists call weak ties. these are the lowstakes relationships with casual acquaintances that you meet from living in the same dorm or apartment complex belonging to the same club or team or in this case taking the same class PERIOD Simple social interactions with classmates have been proven to produce positive mental health outcomes PERIOD Zoom classrooms by nature made such interactions much more difficult if not impossible PERIOD This contributed further to the feelings of isolation that were all too common among students PERIOD

Making classes online because of COVID19 doesnt make sense now and never did to begin with PERIOD In an ideal world all classes that began inperson would continue to be taught as such PERIOD The practice of unnecessary online learning needs to be laid to rest once and for all PERIOD
