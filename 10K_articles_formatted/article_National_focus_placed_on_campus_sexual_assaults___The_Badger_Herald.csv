With one in five women sexually assaulted while in college the White House has rolled out a new package of recommendations entitled Not Alone which includes guidelines for campuses on how to handle sexual assault cases PERIOD

The report released by the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault includes recommendations for understanding the scope of sexual assault issues on campuses through systematic campus surveys helping prevent sexual assault responding appropriately when sexual assault occurs and improving federal enforcement efforts PERIOD

Additionally the recommendations seek to promote bystander intervention in potential sexual assaults support systems such as trained oncampus personnel for sexual assault victims and support victim confidentiality on college campuses across the country PERIOD

Monika Johnson Hostler president of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence said she believed the recommendations were an excellent first step at combating sexual assault in Wisconsin PERIOD

The recommendations are really good and give campuses really good guidance on moving forward Johnson Hostler said PERIOD

She said people should not expect implementation to be uniform across campuses adding policies should be created to fit the culture and climate of individual college campuses PERIOD

Sarah Van Orman executive director at University Health Services also praised the White House task forces report PERIOD

We have folks here at UHS who are experts in this and know what are the best practices and the evidence and we think this report is really good Van Orman said PERIOD Its a call to action in the right ways. van Orman said the task forces recommendations include many elements UHS is already working to implement but added the report helps clarify other aspects while raising national attention on the issue of student sexual assaults PERIOD

Heather LaRoi UW System spokesperson said the system would also implement the White House recommendations in a statement PERIOD

We will fully intend to address the requirements outlined in Title IX theDear Colleague Letter the Violence Against Women Act and to strengthen protocols procedures and practices to improve the campus climate at each UW System institution LaRoi said PERIOD

She also said the UW System intends to ensure its policies and procedures are fully responsive to the White Houses recommendations. currently UW promotes bystander intervention through its TONIGHT program a required video for all freshmen starting with the class of  PERIOD UHS will also be adding a third staff member to focus on violence prevention next year Van Orman said PERIOD

Van Orman said she would have liked to see an element related to criminal prosecution added to the report PERIOD

These are crimes and we know that nationally not only among college students but people in general PERIOD Sexual crimes and sexual violence crimes are not prosecuted and theyre not handled in the way that they should be she said PERIOD

Even without addressing criminal prosecution Van Orman expects further implementation of report recommendations to occur on UW campuses over the next few years PERIOD
