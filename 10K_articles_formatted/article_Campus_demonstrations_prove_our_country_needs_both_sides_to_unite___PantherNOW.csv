Campus demonstrations prove that our country needs both sides to unite

Wherever socialism has been applied in its totality in any region of the world it has failed PERIOD But capitalism is no saint either PERIOD

I believe socialism is much worse but for all its efficiency capitalism is not without its own greedy dark side no system is perfect and that is why balance is the key PERIOD

By the time you finish reading this article I will have undoubtedly achieved pissing most of you off PERIOD

But thats exactly what I want you to do think for yourself not continue to suck at the breasts of left or rightwing politics PERIOD

On February eighteenth President Donald Trump visited FIU to speak on the crisis in Venezuela and I was asked to assist my PantherNow team in covering both sides of the rallies happening on our campus PERIOD

Needless to say the atmosphere was very politically charged for a Monday PERIOD

I began my assignment taking photos and listening to demonstrations on the Graham Center lawns PERIOD

I quickly realized the event was focused not only on Venezuela but on issues such as socialism versus capitalism abortion the border wall the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and all other issues of battle between the left and the right PERIOD

On one side you had an entire display quite gruesome in nature of prolife advocates calling for the banning of abortion nationwide PERIOD On the other side you had a much larger demonstration of the liberal left claiming my body my choice. on the primary issue I witnessed a young Venezuelan student being silenced by the liberal protesters PERIOD

When he asked the speakers if they had ever been to Venezuela they simply told him to Shut the f up and that he could not speak at their rally PERIOD

These protesters were actually calling to reject Juan Guidos coup and for the United States to stay out of Venezuela PERIOD I would venture to call these protesters selfish and feeble minded PERIOD

How dare they claim they know more about Venezuela than the people of Venezuela PERIOD

If the mass exodus from the region into South Florida were not evidence enough for the gravity of the crisis let alone all the evidence of gross human rights violations I dont know what would be PERIOD

If the Venezuelan people have fled to the shores of America and the majority ask us for help how can we turn them away

Therefore it is our moral obligation to intervene somehow and aid the people of that country by any means necessary

On the issue of abortion I am prolife myself PERIOD Indeed it is your body but what choice does the other body living and growing inside you have

No doubt some of you will tell me that because I am a male I have no idea what a woman goes through and therefore have no right to judge anyone PERIOD

And Id say youre right I am a man and cant even begin to imagine the pain and struggle women go through PERIOD

I am however also a human being living and breathing who is thankful to both God and my own mother that I was brought into this world and given the breath of life when I could have easily been killed so that my mother could go on with her own life PERIOD

Ill let those words sink into your minds because this is a prime example of the moral decay our society faces today PERIOD

Now lets talk about walls because during the rally I heard people shout From Palestine to Mexico Lets get our facts straight here if youre referring to the security wall andor fences built around the Judea  Samaria aka the West Bank I remind you that those barriers were built because Palestinian snipers and suicide bombers were infiltrating Israel and killing scores of innocent people and since those barriers went up the number of attacks dramatically declined PERIOD

In Israels case walls definitely work and they are necessary to protect the country against any and all aggressors PERIOD

That being said the situation in Central America continues to deteriorate every day PERIOD

And there are myriads of people seeking refuge in the United States but we cannot ignore the fact that among them are a few very bad apples who prey on the desperate situation of the people around them to infiltrate our country and wreak havoc on our citizens that is why I believe a wall is a necessary evil PERIOD

Regarding other issues such as universal health care climate change and free education these are the issues where I tend to lean left but not without reasonable suspicion PERIOD

I believe the education system has been broken in this country for a long time and is in desperate need of complete reform PERIOD

I also acknowledge that universal healthcare is desperately needed PERIOD And I think conservatives who choose to ignore or deny the very real scientific data on climate change are only inflicting more harm on our planet PERIOD

But I am also aware of politicians on the left who take advantage of these weaknesses in our society in order to advance their own socialist agendas and deprive more Americans of their basic freedoms while the government grows more powerful PERIOD

I am not trying to appease or compromise with any side PERIOD

I am simply stating that perhaps the time has come to throw out both Republican and Democrat parties before our nation descends into a second and very unnecessary civil war because that is what I currently see our nation at the brink of PERIOD

I am saying it is time to actually unite the United States by creating a new party with new and innovative ideas combining elements of both capitalism and socialism while adhering to and defending the sacred principles of our Constitution PERIOD

Throw out anything that sucks and apply whatever actually works PERIOD

If we allow ourselves to continue down the road of divisive extremism as I have witnessed on both the Trump and antiTrump sides we will divide the pillars of this great nation to the point of inevitable collapse PERIOD
