Letter to the Editor  Monday December  

Since the election of Donald Trump Im hearing frequent laments over the rise of populism in the political sphere in this country PERIOD In National ReviewAndrew McCarthy likens populism to Bacchanalia and defines it as doing what you know is wrong heedless of harmful consequences  some unintended others easily foreseeable  because the masses will perceive it as empathy proving conclusively he has never looked up the word in a dictionary PERIOD Bill Kristol in The Weekly Standard wrote that the principles of populism and constitutional liberty are mutually exclusive and that he would permanently reject the former in order to preserve the latter PERIOD

Do any of those criticizing populism including the two writers mentioned actually know what populism is Kristol said he would be sympathetic to an enlightened populism as though that were an actual possibility PERIOD Enlightened populism is impossible not because populism is some Neanderthalesque residue from the bloodandsoil nature of the European farright but because populism isnt an ideology there is absolutely nothing to enlighten whatsoever PERIOD You can have enlightened Socialism or enlightened Christian Democracy but hoping to have enlightened Populism is like hoping to have an enlightened winter coat PERIOD What Kristol gets wrong is that in order to be a Populist the ideological position of what you say is totally irrelevant but the manner in which that position is articulated is of the utmost importance PERIOD You cannot say Populists believe the following because Populism has no beliefs at all PERIOD Populism is not an ideology PERIOD Populism is a style PERIOD

Lets take an example of two individuals who align ideologically Alexander Van der Bellen and JeanLuc Melenchon both prominent figures in the European socialist and socialdemocratic movements who again believe and discuss very similar things PERIOD Van der Bellen is running to be President of Austria on the IndependentGreen ticket PERIOD Have you ever heard him speak It is one of the single most mindnumbingly dull experiences you can ever have PERIOD I have been more entertained watching grey paint dry while having afternoon tea with my dead pet hamster PERIOD The opposite is true of Melenchon the Populist French leader of the Parti Gauche who again believes and discusses very similar things to Van der Bellen PERIOD During my time in the south of France I happened to stumble literally into one of his rallies in Montpellier and given I had some time I thought Id hear him out PERIOD

Maybe it was the fact that the French language naturally lends itself to Leninist rants on hastily constructed wooden stages maybe its the fact that that evening I had been fortunate enough to ingest one glass too many of the fabulous wine of the LanguedocRoussillon region or maybe it was the magnificent rhetorical flair of the speaker that made the same dull ideas that Van der Bellen had discussed seem absolutely tantalizing PERIOD Let me make this abundantly clear Im a proud Capitalist and I have the same reaction to a good quarter of earnings as a 13yearold boy does to a Victorias Secret commercial but even I found myself skipping on home humming The Internationale to myself that evening PERIOD

The difference is Melenchon is a populist Van der Bellen is not PERIOD No matter how similar and horrendous their ideas are they are always going to sound better coming from the firebrand Melenchon then they are from the decrepit Van der Bellen PERIOD The same can be said of any ideology in any country PERIOD Whether youre a an Italian Centrist a Scottish Nationalist or an American Republican Populism is nothing more than a marketing tool designed to make your ideas seem exciting to your listener irrespective of what those ideas actually are PERIOD Also lets not pretend that this is the first time populism has ever existed in the United States Obamas hope and change mantra was populist Reagans Revolution was populist Nixons silent majority was populist and oh right before I forget this country literally had a Populist Party PERIOD

So quit crying over populism PERIOD Disagree with Trumps policies Criticize the policies sure knock yourself out PERIOD But dont sit there and weep at what you see as the looming specterof populism PERIOD Populism is a style adopted by Warren Sanders Obama Cruz Ron Paul and Donald Trump PERIOD Its the only thing any of them have in common and has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the substance of their ideas PERIOD The hysteria surrounding Populism is quite frankly totally juvenile PERIOD
