During the talk showstyle event Dow interviewed slates about SGB allocations mental health resources and interconnectivity between organizations on Pitts campus as well as a few more lighthearted questions designed to test how candidates react under pressure PERIOD

Eric Macadangdang a junior SGB board member majoring in urban studies and history and philosophy of science is the presidential candidate for the Voices Slate PERIOD The slate includes Kathryn Fleisher a junior majoring in politics and philosophy and gender sexuality and womens Studies Annalise Abraham a sophomore focusing on environmental studies and Ben King current chair of the allocations committee and junior political science and communication major PERIOD

According to Macadangdang the slate aims to give a voice to every student organization on campus allowing them more direct say in how resources are allocated PERIOD

The Voices slate members emphasized their intent to adjust the purpose of SGB specifically focusing on the right of student organizations to have clear and open communication with the Universitys administration PERIOD

We need to bring the focus back to representing students on issues people care about like tuition and housing and then the things we directly control which is the student activities fund King said PERIOD

Macadangdang also related Voices to a broader definition of SGBs purpose describing it as a voice for the Pitt student body PERIOD

We understand that  students are crushed by debt who are facing food insecurity facing mental health issues facing sustainability issues on a dying planet have the right to demand the change we want to see on campus and we believe student government can make that change Macadangdang said PERIOD

Aman Reddy a junior microbiology major is running for a board position and is the only individual candidate not running as part of a slate in the  SGB election PERIOD

Reddys platform for SGB is primarily centered on improving the ease of Pitt students access to transportation technology and health services PERIOD

A large part of Reddys plan to make life easier for students focuses on optimizing transportation services for students living off campus PERIOD He would like to add more parking spaces and work with Port Authority to rearrange bus timetables PERIOD

Reddy also emphasized the need for students to have easy access to therapists and doctors PERIOD

While the University is making attempts to improve its resources some of these seem a bit too superficial Reddy said PERIOD We need resources to come to Pitt instead of students going out of their way to seek them out. launch is a two person slate consisting of Tyler Viljaste a sophomore politics and philosophy and finance major and the current community and governmental relations chair on SGB and Cedric Humphrey a junior SGB board member and liaison to the judicial committee who is majoring in political science PERIOD

Viljaste explained the rationale behind the name Launch stressing his intention for SGB to refocus on students futures PERIOD He emphasized how for many students college education is the start of a lifelong career and he wants SGB to help remove obstacles students may face in achieving that future PERIOD

Viljaste is a member of the Pitt fraternity Beta Theta Pi PERIOD At the beginning of Launchs portion of the event Viljaste explained that he would personally like to see SGB work on reforming Greek lifes reputation among the administration and student body PERIOD

According to Viljaste he would like to see more recognition for the charities that Greek organizations contribute to as well as the positive effect they can have on members productivity and social health PERIOD

I think its extremely important to have someone on board who is an active member of Greek life and who is all for affirming the positive aspects of Greek life because without that strong presence nothing is going to change Viljaste said PERIOD

Gandhi a junior majoring in mechanical and electrical engineering and the diversity and inclusion committee chair is the presidential candidate for Yourslate PERIOD He is running for the board alongside Victoria Chuah a junior majoring in computer science PERIOD

Yourslates main goals include improving resident life for students living on campus by creating better disability accommodations and services PERIOD Additionally the slate is planning to create more promotions for arts students a group they said was underrepresented in University social spaces PERIOD

According to its members Yourslate is primarily focused on creating a SGB board comprised of students from different schools majors interests and walks of life in order to ensure SGB establishes open communication with all facets of University life PERIOD

It is called Yourslate because its really all about you  in an urban campus thats inherently decentralized its really the student governments responsibility to connect all the different organizations Gandhi said PERIOD
