Lack of communication between students and the UTA administration became a recurring topic among ideas presented during a strategic planning discussion featuring Student Congress senators on Tuesday PERIOD

Dana Dunn Strategic Planning Committee chairwoman solicited senators for their opinions on how to improve the student experience at UTA which will help shape the universitys strategic plan PERIOD The plan is UTAs way to outline goals and action steps going forward PERIOD The new plan will last through  PERIOD

This should be very important to you because the university is your alma mater or will be your alma mater PERIOD The value of your degree will depend upon how successful we are in crafting a good plan to move us forward to strengthen your university Dunn told Student Congress senators and executive board members PERIOD

Liberal Arts senator Gabriel Escobedo expressed concerns about communication citing the discontinuing of the anthropology graduate program which surprised some students PERIOD There should be a way students know about such things without having to be involved in groups such as Student Congress Escobedo suggested PERIOD

Dunn said communication is a topic administrators talk about and theyd like to know what students best respond to PERIOD Escobedo suggested less frequent messages from the university and more information relevant to a students college or school PERIOD Another senator noted that she pays more attention to messages from her academic adviser PERIOD

Thats one of the biggest problems students have Escobedo said after the gathering PERIOD I think what she Dunn took away from this is that there is a big problem with communication. engineering senator Varun Mallipaddi said there is a disconnect between student organizations and faculty and staff using the example of some not being familiar with events associated with the college PERIOD

He said if faculty and staff are not well informed about events in the college then that will trickle down to students PERIOD

Notwithstanding students did provide other ideas for improving student experience including improving facilities offering 24hour dining options a clinic for engineering students spreading school spirit and the college town mindset and placing emphasis on fields besides science technology engineering and mathematics PERIOD

Student Congress President Jennifer Fox said she was pleased with Dunns visit and everyones participation in the discussion PERIOD Fox a member of the Strategic Planning Committee said she noticed the communication issue students voiced but said the administration is trying evident by recent visits by some she said PERIOD

In addition to Dunn vice presidents John Hall Kelly Davis and Jean Hood spoke before Student Congress PERIOD

Showing up to the meeting shows they care Fox said of administrators PERIOD

The next planning conversation for faculty and staff is from  p.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD on April  in Nedderman Hall  PERIOD
