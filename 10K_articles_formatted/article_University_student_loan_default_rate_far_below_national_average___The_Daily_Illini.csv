The national default rate on student loans for borrowers in their third year of payment decreased between  and  from . percent to . percent PERIOD

For University students this rate was far lower PERIOD In  the rate of default on student loans for borrowers in their third year was just . percent significantly lower than the national rate PERIOD

Among Illinois public fouryear universities in  the University of Illinois had the lowest rate of default for borrowers in their third year of payment followed by the University of Illinois at Chicago whose  default rate was . percent PERIOD

Director of Student Financial Aid Dan Mann said that a number of factors likely contributed to the low rate of default PERIOD

Our students are graduating and getting jobs so they have the ability to pay their student loans Mann said PERIOD We have been able to increase and provide more aid as well as expand the group that is getting some needbased aid a little bit because of the additional dollars that is being put in. research conducted by the Department of Financial Aid painted a clear picture of a typical student that has to default on their loans PERIOD

That profile seemed to be students who may have come one year or maybe two years dropped out probably didnt have a job when they dropped out and didnt repay their student loans Mann said of the data PERIOD The big thing that we really found was whether or not you got a degree or not seemed to be a big factor. in a study of  University students  defaulted of those students  percent were undergraduate students and  percent did not receive a degree PERIOD Half of the students that defaulted did so for less than  worth of debt according to Mann PERIOD

Brandon Hudspeth senior in LAS receives needbased aid from the University and says that while he is grateful for the financial assistance he receives he recognizes that not every student is as fortunate as he is PERIOD

Im one of the lucky ones said Hudspeth whose tuition is entirely covered by the financial aid he receives PERIOD But then again if it werent for financial aid I wouldnt be going here. while the Universitys student loan default rate is far below the national average it is the most expensive public university in the Big Ten for instate residents with tuition and housing expenses totaling more than  PERIOD

University law school graduate Anthony Fiorentino who started the Universitys Student Debt Committee last year said that while the committees biggest achievement was successfully getting both chambers of the Illinois legislature to pass a resolution that calls for Congress to restore bankruptcy protection for student loans the current Congress does not have the best interest of Americas students at heart PERIOD

Theyre not interested in making these reforms because the current Congress we have are advocating only for the interests of the banking institutions and the financial institutions who lobbied to get these laws in the first place Fiorentino said PERIOD

He added that without meaningful reform to student loan law this current generation of students could be facing a bleak economy in the future PERIOD

What happens is our economy first of all is going to continue to slide because younger generations are spending less money they are living more off of debt theyre not able to buy cars theyre not able to buy homes Fiorentino said PERIOD All the money that previous generations were putting into retirement youre going to be putting into student loans. josh can be reached at emailprotected PERIOD",University student loan default rate far below national average - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
