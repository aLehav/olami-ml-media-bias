If youre looking to enjoy some scares and laughs with friends this weekend look no further PERIOD As someone who generally is not the biggest fan of horror movies I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying the classic Scream movies during a movie night with some friends PERIOD With six movies under its belt and a seventh on the way the Scream franchise has come to be known as an iconic and beloved slasher series with a touch of humor PERIOD The murder mystery in each movie will have you on the edge of your seat as you try to figure out who Ghostface is PERIOD Whether you are watching the movies in a theater or at home Scream is a great way to get into the Halloween spirit PERIOD

Disneys cult classic Hocus Pocus is my favorite Halloween movie PERIOD While perhaps not designed exactly for our collegeage demographic this movie has stuck with me and many of my peers since we were kids PERIOD This fantasycomedy is familyfriendly and reliable for bringing a laugh PERIOD The catchy soundtrack invites silly singalongs and an entertaining watch PERIOD This year is its thirtieth anniversary and it will be shown in some theaters PERIOD Once youve watched the first movie you can try watching the sequel Hocus Pocus . hocus Pocus can be streamed on Disney and Hulu or purchased on Amazon Prime Video Vudu and more PERIOD

Michaela Scott lifestyles assistant editor

My favorite movie during this time of year has to be Halloweentown. this 90s film is a Disney Channel Original Movie that takes place in another dimension where monsters skeletons goblins and all sorts of creatures can live in peace away from the world that humans know PERIOD In the beginning the main character Marnie realizes that she is a witch recognizes her heritage in the spooky town and brings her family along for the adventure PERIOD One reason why this is such a classic film is because there are four movies in the series to bingewatch PERIOD I must admit that I have not watched the fourth movie because Marnie was recast however the first three are worth the watch PERIOD In the first two movies Marnies family fights evil forces that attempt to destroy the town and the dimension PERIOD In the third Marnie brings the teenagers of Halloween to her high school to try to integrate them into human life PERIOD If you are looking for a relaxing way to spend your evening the Halloweentown series is available on Disney Hulu or purchased on YouTube and Vudu PERIOD

If you are interested in delving into a newer horror franchise then you should check out Ti Wests newest movies X and Pearl. coming from the legendary film studio A24 these two movies came out last year in  after secretly being filmed backtoback and were a major hit with both the box office and horror fans PERIOD Classified as slasher films these movies stand out from the usual blood and gore by having deeper thematic undertones of sexuality and youthfulness in X and being more of a character study on the eponymous villain of Pearl PERIOD The movies have killer performances from prominent scream queen actresses of the modern era with both Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega starring in them PERIOD With a third movie in development now and expected to release in  now would be the perfect time to get into these movies and get into the mood for Halloween PERIOD

Although another holiday is mentioned in the title The Nightmare Before Christmas is my favorite movie to watch around Halloween PERIOD Ive never been able to sit through a horror film so this dark fantasy musical does just the trick to put me in a spooky spirit PERIOD Written by Tim Burton the  stopmotion film takes place in Halloween Town where Jack Skellington rules as the Pumpkin King PERIOD After unexpectedly stumbling across Christmas Town he decides some changes need to be made to the jolly December holiday PERIOD Unlike horror films The Nightmare Before Christmasis a movie for all ages and has been with me my entire life PERIOD As a young girl I couldnt sit through any scene involving Oogie Boogie but now I sing along to every word of his song PERIOD Come Christmas time Ill be sure to watch this classic once again on Disney as The Nightmare Before Christmas makes my dream for a transitional holiday movie come true PERIOD

No matter how old I am Its the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown will forever hold a special place in my heart as one of the best goto Halloween classics PERIOD The nostalgic  cartoon became an annual October tradition for my family as we would snack on popcorn snuggle up with blankets and giggle as we watched The Peanutstake on Halloween PERIOD From bobbing for apples at Violets Halloween party to trickortreating in a bedsheet ghost costume every aspect of this special feature perfectly reflects the spooky holiday PERIOD Despite the modernization of cinema this familyfriendly production remains a vintage throwback that kindles humbleness and brings a flattering sense of humorous spook and joy PERIOD This year Charlie Brown and Snoopy can be streamed through Apple TV or YouTube PERIOD



No matter what your Halloween plans are these movies are classics that you can enjoy with your friends as we finish up celebrating this holiday season PERIOD
