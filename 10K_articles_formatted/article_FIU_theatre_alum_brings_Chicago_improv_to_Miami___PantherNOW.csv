Home to a number of current University Theatre students and alumni Villain Theater is quickly becoming Miamis No. spot for improvisational theater PERIOD

Mir credits his training at the Universitys Theatre Department as instrumental in his approach to his work at Villain Theater PERIOD

One thing FIU tries to be and we try to be is as diverse as possible PERIOD Thats one of the great things about Miami and I learned to appreciate that at FIU Theatre he said PERIOD

Mir also notes the value and benefit in being a versatile learner PERIOD

The opportunities that FIU Theatre gives to it students to participate in all aspects of theatre PERIOD Everybody knows everybody elses jobs so they can do theirs better PERIOD You got to have an appreciation for all aspects of theater he said PERIOD

This Mir and several FIU faculty members say is what makes a theater artist truly wellrounded and successful PERIOD

Mir cites the closeness of Miamis theatre community as an inciting reason for student and alumni involvement at Villain Theater PERIOD Traditionally New York and Chicago are seen as the American meccas for improvisational comedy theater PERIOD However in a small growing community Mir hopes to elevate Miami theater to the same playing field PERIOD

I think Miami has a very small theater community and FIU is a part of that community and going there helped me meet people in the community said Mir PERIOD It can be a little daunting when someone says Get on a stage and make people laugh with no script and no direction. we had a great starting group of FIU alumni who took the leap to get in classes and I feel my connection to FIU Theatre helped me get that going. following their time in the big apple Mir and Quintana decided to take what they learned in New York and Chicago and incorporate it in a community of comedians and actors in Miami PERIOD

Not only are alumni involved in the shows and classes at Villain but certain current FIU students have also made a name for themselves at the quicklyexpanding theater PERIOD

Joey Ganguzza theatre design major expounded on the similarities between the two closely connected organizations PERIOD

Theyre both very encouraging environments where youre able to feel comfortable making a fool out of yourself he said PERIOD

Ganguzza also spoke on the support he feels from the staff at Villain Theater and his professional growth PERIOD

Its become a third home to me PERIOD I laugh harder at Villain than anywhere else in the world but its so much more to me than just a comedy club he said PERIOD Thanks to Villain Ive not only experienced unbelievable growth as a writer and performer but Ive made incredible friends who are as talented as they are loyal and even earned the admiration of a wonderful woman. your email address will not be published PERIOD
