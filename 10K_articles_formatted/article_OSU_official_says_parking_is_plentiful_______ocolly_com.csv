Oklahoma State University has plenty of spaces for parking overflow but some people may think that they are inconvenient said an OSU parking official PERIOD



Students who cant find a space in their designated area can park in the  overflow spaces around campus if they own a blue or silver zone parking permit said James Moser parking manager for OSU Parking Services PERIOD



Overflow lots  and 94A are northeast of Lewis Field and lot  is north of the Colvin Center PERIOD Lot  is north of the Veterinary Medicine Building and lot  is north of the intramural field by the Colvin Center PERIOD



So far we have not had our overflow lots full this year Moser said PERIOD



However lot  seems to peak during the days high point he said PERIOD He said if an overflow lot becomes full he plans to post signs with a map at each entrance requesting commuters to go to the next available lot PERIOD



If he observes most cars using lot  Parking Services will provide two temporary bus stops near the area he said PERIOD



Moser said overcrowding problems begin when school starts in the fall PERIOD



There is always a greater influx of problems at the beginning of the year he said PERIOD



He said problems happen for two reasons Students who have last years permits can use those until Aug PERIOD  of the following year and students figure out that Parking Services is lenient with students during the first week of school PERIOD



Moser said he thinks OSU needs a new parking garage but it is too expensive and not feasible for Parking Services to consider it PERIOD



To build a parking lot it costs  per space whereas for a parking garage it is  per space he said PERIOD



He said Parking Services usually sells permits for . cars per parking space which is an unwritten national standard PERIOD It is used universally by universities and parking garage management PERIOD



This year Parking Services sold permits for . cars per parking space he said PERIOD



Moser said usually . cars are given to one parking space because commuters are not attending class at the same time PERIOD



When youre dealing with commuters youre dealing with a come and go situation Moser said PERIOD You should never be oversold because people come and go. for commuters in the silver north zone a total of  permits was sold Moser said PERIOD



In the blue commuter south zone Parking Services sold  permits  hanging and  permanently affixed he said PERIOD



Parking Services never stops selling permits he said PERIOD Permits are offered throughout the year because numerous overflow parking spaces exist PERIOD



Moser said some people perceive that there is a lack of convenient parking PERIOD



Some students have called to complain about the amount of time it takes to walk from the parking lots to their class Moser said PERIOD



Parking Services wanted to provide factual information to those who might have a misconception about how much time it takes to walk to class he said PERIOD Therefore tests with a rollatape and a stopwatch were done to measure distances and time he said PERIOD



We did it to show actual time from point A to point B via the sidewalks Moser said PERIOD



For example walking from the overflow lot  to the Classroom Building takes  minutes and about  seconds he said PERIOD



He said any person can beat the times because shortcuts were not factored into the tests PERIOD



Moser said some incorrect parking such as in a nonparking space has occurred in some of the lots around campus PERIOD



The fine for incorrect parking is  PERIOD However parking in a fire lane is  PERIOD



Last month Parking Services issued  incorrect parking tickets and  tickets for parking in the wrong zone Moser said PERIOD
