In order to keep the building up to Illinois safety codes the university recently spent  million remodeling the Taylor dining and residence hall PERIOD



We did a hall and dining renovation at Taylor because we had to update the fire system to have sprinklers by January said Mark Hudson the director of University Housing and Dining Services PERIOD

All the money used to complete the remodel was internal dollars Hudson said PERIOD

The renovation to the lighting in the building may be the most noticeable improvement PERIOD

MTVU also gave the hall new flat screen TVs new chairs and new flooring Hudson said PERIOD

The renovations were not only done to keep up with codes but to also satisfy students needs he added PERIOD

The shower room in the north wing of Taylor Hall was also included in the renovation PERIOD

The showers now have a privacy space for when the residents step out to dry off and put clothes on as well as having the ceilings and carpet in the hall replaced PERIOD

Kirstin Rohwedder a sophomore special education and elementary education major said she liked differences in the hall PERIOD

I like the renovations a lot Rohwedder said PERIOD It looks so much better then it used to. not only was the dining hall itself revamped but the menu has changed as well Hudson said PERIOD

The changes in Taylor could also help make the dining hall as popular as its counterpart Thomas Dining Center PERIOD

Five years ago Taylor was the best dining hall PERIOD Then three years ago Thomas was remodeled and that became the hot center Hudson said PERIOD

Victoria Trebels a junior recreation administration major said she likes the food options now offered at the renovated dining hall PERIOD

There is always something to look forward to every night Trebels said PERIOD

As Taylors menu changes and attracts more customers students will eventually want the weekend hall changed back to Taylor Hudson said

Students need to experience all the dining centers each is different and with different variety Hudson said PERIOD
