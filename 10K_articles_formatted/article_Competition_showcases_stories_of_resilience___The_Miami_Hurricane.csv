As Black Awareness Month quickly approaches the Eta Delta Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. hosted their third annual Dr PERIOD Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD Oratorical Competition Friday night PERIOD

Targeting high school male minorities the competition aimed to improve public speaking skills and give the young men an appropriate setting in which to express themselves PERIOD

A lot of these students do not finish high school opportunities where they have a platform to express themselves and realize their potential are rare said junior Reginald Sainvil a brother of Alpha Phi Alpha PERIOD

It is our hope to inspire these disadvantaged young men to follow their dreams and to become better individuals in the spirit of Dr PERIOD Martin Luther King he said PERIOD

Along with assisting the participants in public speaking the competition provides an opportunity to uplift young African American men PERIOD
Its important that we host this oratorical because it serves to empower our youth junior Sean Welsh said PERIOD Many of the young men we reach out to through this particular event come from less than fortunate upbringings PERIOD In most cases they come from environments that dont really foster a bright future. as a brother of Alpha Phi Alpha King valued perseverance PERIOD

Participants Jason Gothelf Paul Osei Rodin Celindor Andrew Ranglin and Alexander Rodriguez came from MiamiDade and Broward counties and used Kings perseverance as the topic for discussion PERIOD Each spoke about how they persevered through rough patches in their lives PERIOD Whether it was coming to America from another country or surviving a brain tumor every student had a story PERIOD

They seemed to be speaking from the heart junior Dara Collins said PERIOD I thought the topic relayed back to Martin Luther Kings dream well PERIOD It is pivotal and important to remind people that MLKs dream although we are making strides hasnt been achieved yet and theres still work to be done in all walks of life and for all different types of people. although some had more heartfelt stories than others the participants were judged on content and poise PERIOD In the end Rodriguez was declared the winner of the competition and won a  scholarship PERIOD He hopes to become a pediatric neurologist after studying at Harvard PERIOD

Using the past two competitions as learning experiences the fraternity began planning for this years event much earlier PERIOD They raised a considerable amount of money through sponsorships and reached out to more people gaining more contestants than in the past PERIOD

In addition to making the competition available to the students the chapter plans on building a mentorship with the young men PERIOD Hopes of future scholarships with companies such as College Board and Kaplan will offer discounts for the SAT and ACT PERIOD Their main focus is to help them become successful and make positive decisions PERIOD

With this Oratorical Competition we hope to encourage theseyoung men to tap into their potential and use it for the greater good Welsh said PERIOD We want to see them make it to college and be successful in life. mikayla Vielot may be contacted at mvielotthemiamihurricane.com PERIOD
