4957,2013-02-19,"president Barack Obama gestures while giving his State of the Union address during a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington Tuesday Feb PERIOD   PERIOD

As President Barack Obamas ears grow so do the words he uses to explain the governments budget negotiations PERIOD The fiscal cliff has become sequestration  a term used to explain mandatory cuts in government programs PERIOD

With all the jargon being tossed around in Washington D.C. it is important to understand the meanings behind terms politicians use PERIOD Obama and other lawmakers use terms like sequestration to hide simple concepts that almost anyone can understand PERIOD

We would like to do our best to explain sequestration what it means and where it comes from PERIOD

Sequestration in normal use refers to the act of taking property to ensure payment PERIOD When a pawnshop gives a person a loan on a guitar for example the pawnshop sequesters the guitar until payment on the loan is made PERIOD

The term commonly is used in court cases to ensure payment of fines and judgments PERIOD A court can issue an order of sequestration that allows the sheriff to take physical possession of a defendants property PERIOD

So why are we using it to talk about the national budget To put it simply Lawmakers pawned America to themselves PERIOD

The Budget Control Act of  put in place mandatory cuts in the federal budget as part of negotiations to get Republicans to approve an increase in the debt ceiling PERIOD Obama and Democrats thought the federal government needed more money so they got Republicans to agree to raise the national debt as long as mandatory cuts were made later on to help offset the cost PERIOD

These cuts add up to  billion in  and  trillion over  years PERIOD

Cuts would be across the board which means many federally funded programs would be subject to cuts PERIOD These include military education and Medicare programs PERIOD Some programs will be exempt

including Social Security veterans programs and Pell grants PERIOD

Like a pawnshop the sequestration of government programs was used to guarantee lawmakers would find a way to fund the national debt increase PERIOD But Obama and lawmakers mostly Democrats are trying to find a way to pay the bill and get these programs out of pawn PERIOD

Democrats have proposed increases in tax revenues to fill the gap PERIOD Their proposal includes tax increases on earners making more than  million a year and closing loopholes in corporate tax structures among other ideas PERIOD

In short sequestration is a policy that lawmakers created in  and are now trying to solve PERIOD Sequestration might have a fancy name but it is based on a simple idea PERIOD Whether the cuts go through or not lawmakers will pat themselves on the back for handling a problem they created PERIOD
