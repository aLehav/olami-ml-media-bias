2379,2023-10-26,"the first week on campus is great I wish every other week of the school year was like it PERIOD Its termed syllabus week for the fact that the only thing that gets accomplished in class is that teachers hand out and go over syllabi PERIOD Its practically like having another week of summer so if youre worried about taking a test or quiz the first week you can stop now PERIOD If youre new to campus or out of ideas then here are five things you should do during your first week on campus while youre busy not doing homework PERIOD



 PERIOD Eat out on Green Street

Id venture to say that Green Street is the most happening place on campus especially at night PERIOD Complete with bars restaurants and stores its basically like a city block PERIOD Green Street has the usual chain restaurants like Noodles  Company Chipotle and Panera but also some ChampaignUrbana specialties like Zorbas and Cravings PERIOD All of these places are delicious and some are open until the wee hours of the mornings for any latenight cravings PERIOD

 PERIOD Quad Day



Quad Day takes place the Sunday before classes start and its a great way to get involved in all of the Registered Student Organizations that are on campus PERIOD There are hundreds of booths that are set up on  you guessed it  the Quad From Squirrel Watching Club to Water Polo theres a club for everyone and most have signup lists where you can write down your email address and receive updates about meetings and events PERIOD Although it might be sweltering hot and seem like theres no method to the madness grab a friend and walk around PERIOD I guarantee that you will be handed more pens and bottle openers than you know what to do with and you might end up actually joining one of the  RSOs you signed up for PERIOD

 PERIOD Meet new people

This sounds so simple but its something that will help you later on in the year PERIOD The first week especially for freshmen is all about establishing what the rest of the next four years will be like PERIOD So keep the door open in your dorm room say hello to people in your classes and make an effort to be extra friendly PERIOD Its easy to hang out with high school friends during the first week because you already know them but take a step outside your comfort zone and experience the amazing diversity that this University has to offer PERIOD

 PERIOD Buy apparel

Last year my cousin who goes to college in Missouri was visiting campus and one of the first things she noticed was how many people were wearing orange and blue PERIOD People are proud to wear our school colors so jump on the bandwagon and buy some spirit wear PERIOD Its great that we have built such a great community and you dont want to be left out PERIOD As long as it says Illinois or has school colors on it I guarantee that no matter what you buy it will be in fashion PERIOD

 PERIOD Attend a football game

Oskeewowwow Show off your fabulous new sweatshirt at a football game PERIOD One of the great things about going to a Big Ten school is that sporting events are spectacular PERIOD Buy tickets and sit in Block I if you can the student section whose cheering and chanting is unparalleled PERIOD Its such an experience to see the sea of orange and blue in Memorial Stadium and feel so small in comparison PERIOD
