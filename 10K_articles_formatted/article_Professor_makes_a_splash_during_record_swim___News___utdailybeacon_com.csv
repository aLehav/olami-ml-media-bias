To most Knoxvillians swimming in the Tennessee River is something they avoid doing PERIOD To Andreas Fath its what hes made to do PERIOD

Over the the latter end of July and August Fath  will attempt to swim all  miles of the Tennessee River to raise awareness of the importance of water quality by collecting data on the Tennessee River and attempting to beat a world record PERIOD

A native of Speyer am Rhein in Germany Fath is no stranger to swimming PERIOD He has had numerous successes in the swimming pool such as being a German relay record holder and university champion in the late 1980s and frequent achievements in open water swimming like being the recordmaking winner of the  Zrich Marathon for his age group a record that still stands today PERIOD

If Fath accomplishes his goal it would be his second world record he has beaten PERIOD His first was in  when he swam the Rhine river in twentyfive days a distance of  miles PERIOD

On the morning of July  Fath started his swim called Tenneswim at the headwaters of the river the union of the French Broad and Holston Rivers about a mile away from Ijams Nature Center PERIOD He took some samples of the water for testing then began his swim to a crowd at Ijams Nature Center River Landing PERIOD

Tennewsim is being sponsored by various educational and environmental groups such as Hochschule Furtwangen University  where Fath is a professor the Tennessee Valley Authority Ijams Nature Center and more PERIOD

Tiffany Foster a worker in the natural resources group at the TVA was at the dock to see how Fath is aiding the Tennessee River PERIOD Part of her job is to promote environmental education and protection of the Tennessee River system PERIOD

Hes trying to increase awareness of protecting the Tennessee River PERIOD And that is a key part of TVAs mission and it has been for eighty plus years Foster said PERIOD We are heavily invested in the valley and making sure the waters stay clean and that theyre good for navigation and that theyre good for recreation and that people can enjoy them PERIOD So we love partnering with groups like this that are all about promoting protecting and awareness of the river. once Fath arrived at the River Landing he got out of the water to join Amber Park Executive Director of Ijams and Chrisi Branscom Deputy Mayor and Chief Operating Officer of the City of Knoxville for a short talk about the event PERIOD

Before Fath spoke to the crowd Branscom talked about the importance of the Tennessee River to the area and the commitment of Knoxvilles citizens to the river PERIOD Branscom mentioned the efforts of local people to clean up the river saying that twentyone tons of trash have been picked up in previous efforts to clean the river PERIOD

The waterways are very important to us PERIOD They are our lifeline Branscom said

Once Branscom was finished Fath told a brief explanation of what he was trying to do with his marathon swim where in the twenty miles he hopes to swim each day and how he will be analyzing the waters to compare the Tennessee River to the Rhine PERIOD Fath explained that he will take samples of chemicals pharmaceuticals and microplastics in the river with a microfabric attached to his leg PERIOD

Fath stressed the importance of finding microplastics in the waterways as it is estimated that by  there will be more plastics in the worlds waters than fish PERIOD To combat this he stressed the importance of reducing reusing recycling PERIOD

Everything goes into water at the end of the day Fath explained PERIOD

The reason he chose the Tennessee River was through contact with Martin Knoll a professor of geology and hydrology at Sewanee The University of the South and the team leader of Faths swim PERIOD They found that the water quality length and water volume of the Tennessee River was similar to that of the Rhine PERIOD

Before Fath entered the water again with other swimmers including the son of Knoll Fath had one more statement PERIOD

Of course the river will test me Fath said PERIOD But Ill be testing the river too
