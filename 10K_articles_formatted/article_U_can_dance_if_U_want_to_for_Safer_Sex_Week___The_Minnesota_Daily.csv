Sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies are nothing to laugh at especially when they are preventable PERIOD
But laugh  and learn  is exactly what Boynton Health Service hopes students will do this week as Safer Sex Week begins today PERIOD
The week of activities which ends Thursday will give students an opportunity to learn about safe sex practices by participating in a number of fun activities PERIOD
Activities include the stitching of an AIDS quilt a candlelight HIVAIDS vigil a 1980s theme dance and a safer sex maze PERIOD
The purpose for Safer Sex Week is to educate students about safe sex practices early in the school year before bad habits take hold said Dave Dorman health educator at Boynton Health Service PERIOD
We felt if we could get some of the information and issues out earlier in the year wed have a better chance of having an impact on helping students to develop safer sex strategies Dorman said PERIOD Our main goal he added is to minimize the amount of STD spreading and unintended pregnancies. many of the activities such as the sex maze and the distribution of condoms and healthrelated information have traditionally taken place in February during National Condom Week PERIOD
Although these activities will be repeated in the winter Dorman and members of Boyntons Sexual Health Awareness and Disease Education program felt that it was important to educate students in the fall PERIOD
Jessica Swann cocoordinator of the health program said the events were intentionally sandwiched between National Coming Out Week and the Universitys Homecoming PERIOD
She added that because Homecoming is traditionally a big beerdrinking week its important to promote safe sex practices now PERIOD
The health program is a 5yearold student organization that consists of  peer educators who promote safe sex in high schools residence halls fraternities sororities and campus cultural centers PERIOD
Activities begin today in Coffman Memorial Union with stitching panels for the AIDS quilt PERIOD Campus community members will be able to purchase a rectangle for  and stitch it into the quilt PERIOD The finished quilt will be stitched into a larger quilt that will be unveiled Dec PERIOD  on World AIDS Day in Washington D.C PERIOD
Saturdays main activities include the candlelight vigil and 80s theme dance in Coffmans Great Hall PERIOD The Safety Dance will celebrate STD prevention efforts Swann said PERIOD
The quilting and candlelight vigil were planned to correspond to activities taking place in Washington D.C. Dorman said PERIOD
Events for the week will encourage people to engage in discussions of safe sex practices and sexual health issues Dorman said PERIOD They include a debate about how federal officials may have mislead the public about the danger of AIDS and the distribution of free condoms and brochures PERIOD
The week will also involve the showing of the  film Jeffrey and discounts on bowling in the Gopher Game Room PERIOD
