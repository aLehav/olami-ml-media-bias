LSU sophomore wide receiver Malachi Dupre  and junior wide receiver Travin Dural  walk of the field during the Tigers  defeat against The University of Alabama on Saturday Nov PERIOD   in the BryantDenny Stadium PERIOD

LSU coach Ed Orgeron doesnt need a reminder about the importance of breaking the Tigers fivegame losing streak to Alabama PERIOD

Even during his past stops at Miami Syracuse and USC the 55yearold coach still paid attention when the two teams played and he also understands the gripes the Tiger faithful have about the streak PERIOD

I get the passion PERIOD Thats the way it should be Orgeron said PERIOD I know the people are not satisfied with the way its gone PERIOD I get that. lSU hasnt beat the Crimson Tide since  which was dubbed the The Game of The Century after the Tigers won  in overtime PERIOD Since then LSU has come close to defeating Alabama in  and  but suffered double digit losses in  and  PERIOD

Alabama has won three out of the last five matchups against LSU in Tiger Stadium with the combined score being  and two of those games going into overtime PERIOD Additionally for the sixteenth straight time both teams are ranked entering Saturdays contest PERIOD

Its one of the biggest rivalry games in college football according to junior quarterback Danny Etling PERIOD

When the Tigers last defeated the Tide in  Etling was on an unofficial visit to the University of Wisconsin PERIOD He pulled over at a restaurant to watch the final moments of the game PERIOD

Etling said he understands the rivalry and history of the two teams but two years ago he didnt expect to be preparing to duel with the Tide PERIOD

Its something that brings an extra degree of intensity that I think well have to prepare for Etling said PERIOD Its just kind of what you expect when these two teams play. for some players this game has been circled on their calendar weeks before the season started  and normally the ramifications are huge PERIOD

This season the Tigers just want to continue the momentum that Orgeron has brought PERIOD

For this team this program community  I mean everybody their year  almost hinges upon Alabama win or lose junior fullback J.D PERIOD Moore said PERIOD Personally it would just be a great win for this team PERIOD It would mean a lot just continuing what we started under Coach O and for all the Tiger fans out there. breaking the losing streak to the Tide isnt only important for the LSU fanbase its vital to the Tigers juniors and seniors to win PERIOD

We keep that in the back of our minds junior offensive lineman K.J PERIOD Malone said PERIOD We can be the first team in five years to beat Alabama especially for all these seniors and all of us coming in together thats one goal on our mind. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
