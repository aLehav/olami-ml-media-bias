A Voice for the Students

By Noelle Nichols 

High levels of toxins from algae blooms have been reported lakewide in Owasco Lake on Sept PERIOD  and people in the region are concerned about the future of their safe drinking water PERIOD

The Cayuga County Health Department recently published information regarding a previously undetected cyanotoxin homoanatoxin in Owasco Lake which as a result has led to traces of this toxin in the city of Auburns drinking water PERIOD

The homoanatoxin is now in the water near the Indian Cove and the Buck Point area of Owasco Lake due to the lakes most recent harmful algae bloom HAB according to a Cayuga County Health Department press release PERIOD

Homoanatoxin is just one cyanotoxin produced as a result of HABs from cyanobacteria more commonly known as bluegreen algae PERIOD

Microcystins more common type of cyanotoxin released from bluegreen algae was reported as being present in the lake as well according to the press release PERIOD

HABs are nothing new to those familiar with Owasco Lake PERIOD

Shannon Collins  a researcher of aquatic systems in the Finger Lakes Region knew that the bloom was not out of the ordinary PERIOD

Considering the higher temperatures weve been having along with a very rainy summer this bloom doesnt seem too surprising said Collins via Facebook Message PERIOD

According to the New York State Department of Conservations Harmful Algal Blooms HABs Noti cations Page some areas of Owasco Lake may be clear and support recreational uses however it is in ones best interest to survey the area thoroughly PERIOD

What makes the HABs in Owasco Lake so concerning is that the lake supplies drinking water for the town of Owasco N.Y. as wellasforthecityofAuburnN.Y PERIOD

Ingesting the contaminated water is dangerous to humans PERIOD Some side e ects include nausea vomiting skin diarrhea and skin or throat irritation PERIOD

According to the national  day Health Advisory level set by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA young children under the age of six should not drink water containing . ugL of microcystins PERIOD Schoolaged children of six years and older as well as other vulnerable populations should not drink water containing . ugL of microcystins PERIOD

As of Oct PERIOD  the town of Owasco N.Y. and the city of Auburn N.Y. had each of their respective water treatment plants tested for microcystins according to the Cayuga County Governments  Drinking Water Sampling Data PERIOD

The levels of tested microcystins in drinking water for both municipalities are below the EPAs national 10day Health Advisorylevel.Howeverinthecity of Auburn N.Y. their raw water contains . ugL of microcystins which can be harmful if drank by young children under the age of six PERIOD

The blooms are just horri c said Bob Brower President of the Owasco Watershed Lake Association in an interview with Payton Zigler at NCC News PERIOD It may easily be the most signi cant water quality issue that Ill see in my lifetime PERIOD

Collins sees the HABs not only as an issue of water quality but also water security PERIOD

Nevertheless it is important that we recognize the trend of increasing harmful algal blooms in the Finger Lakes said Collins PERIOD If we keep up a business as usual attitude we could very well nd ourselves without any potable water at our ngertips in the near future. the FLX Press reached out to the lead reporter on water issues for Cayuga countys The Citizen Gwendolyn Craig for comment PERIOD Craig told the FLX Press team that she would prefer not to comment on that topic since she is still actively investigating the situation PERIOD

If you spot a potential HAB be sure to ll out a form and submit it to the NYS DEC

Still concerned about cyanotoxins Be sure to check out the harmful algal blooms and drinking water factsheet from the EPA for more information PERIOD
