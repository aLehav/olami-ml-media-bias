Sean Hastings Sports EditorApril  

The Panthers are no stranger to late game comebacks or key late inning twoout threerun home runs to get Eastern on its way to an OVC win PERIOD Senior Ashlynne Paul launched a threerun shot in the fourth inning with two outs to tie game at four in Easterns win over Southeast Missouri Saturday PERIOD

Eastern picked up its fourth and fifth wins of the OVC portion of its schedule with a  win in game one and a  win in game two Saturday PERIOD The Panthers moved to  in OVC play and SEMO dropped to  PERIOD

For whatever reason it has taken a little bit for the Panthers bats to come alive and are relied on to make a comeback but going down early has not been a problem for Eastern PERIOD

We are just confident in ourselves and stay calm Paul said PERIOD When we are relaxed and confident we know we can get the job done and score the runs we need. southeast Missouri scored one in the bottom of the first which was answered by Eastern and scored three more in the third but Pauls home run erased that and then the runs kept coming PERIOD

Junior Michelle Rogers started in the circle for the Panthers but struggled to keep the Redhawks from crossing the plate forcing Kim Schuette to go to junior Jessica Wireman in the third inning for relief PERIOD

Wireman shut the door on Southeast Missouri giving up just one run in the seventh inning that did not have an effect as Eastern already had a threerun lead before PERIOD

Eastern tacked on two important runs in the top of the seventh taking advantage of backtobacktoback miscues by the Redhawks PERIOD Sophomore Mady Poulter started the inning off with a single then the wheels fell off for Southeast Missouri PERIOD

Junior Kiley Pelker reached on an error moving Poulter to second PERIOD Poulter moved to third on a wild pitch and then scored on another wild pitch PERIOD Pelker scored on the next play on Pauls sac bunt PERIOD

Eastern figured it out in the second game against the Redhawks and a lightsout performance from Wireman made that a little easier PERIOD Wireman gave up just three hits and one run in the seventh inning to pick up her ninth win of the year after getting the win in game one PERIOD

Freshman Mia Davis drove in junior Taylor Monahan on a double to left center in the first inning PERIOD Monahan singled through the left side right before Davis double PERIOD

En route to the Panthers  win in the second game of the doubleheader freshman Haley Mitchell reached on an error that scored junior Tori Johnson PERIOD Senior Amber Toenyes picked up an RBI resulting in another earned run towards SEMOs starting pitcher Alexis Estes PERIOD

And just for good measure sophomore Kayla Bear knocked in a run in the seventh to give Eastern a little bit of insurance Wireman did not need PERIOD

Facing a sevengame OVC road trip a solid start was needed for Eastern after going  at home PERIOD Playing the games on the road would be a test PERIOD
The test will continue next weekend with a doubleheader Saturday against Morehead State and a doubleheader against Eastern Kentucky Sunday PERIOD

Morehead is  through its first six OVC contests and Eastern Kentucky is  to start conference play PERIOD
