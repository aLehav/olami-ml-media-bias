Villanova had an impressive performance on the mound this weekend against Iona PERIOD

James Haupt Staff WriterMarch  

This past weekend Villanovas baseball team faced off against Iona in a threegame set going  on the weekend PERIOD

In its first game of the weekend Villanova secured its third win of the season winning  PERIOD

The Wildcats Saturday game was pushed to Sunday due to rain and Villanova played a doubleheader PERIOD On Sunday the Cats went  losing  in the first game and falling again to Iona in the third game  PERIOD

In the first game of the series the Wildcats dominated as Fridays matchup was highlighted by big hits and impressive bullpen work PERIOD

Senior CF AJ Hansen got the scoring started for Villanova with a solo homerun in the bottom half of the first inning PERIOD The Wildcats really took over the game in the third inning where it put up six runs to make it  PERIOD

The Cats also took advantage of some wild pitching in this inning as four runs came off of walks PERIOD Grad Student third baseman Stephen Grober also brought in two runs of his own this inning with a single PERIOD He had a huge impact in this game as he finished  with a walk one run and two RBIs PERIOD

The victory was highlighted by the bullpen performance PERIOD Senior pitcher Chic DeGaetano started the game but was taken out in the second inning after allowing three earned runs on six hits in just . innings PERIOD

Three pitchers made appearances out of the bullpen each throwing more than two innings PERIOD Senior Luke Dziados was rewarded with the win as he pitched . innings and allowed one run on four hits with one strikeout PERIOD

The strongest outing came from graduate student Stephen Turzai who earned the save after throwing a perfect . innings PERIOD He recorded five strikeouts and allowed zero runs on zero hits PERIOD

I was happy with the bullpen coach Kevin Mulvey said PERIOD Chic didnt have his best stuff and I figured the bullpen would give the best chance. the great pitching continued in the second game of the series on Sunday despite the loss PERIOD

Junior pitcher Devin Rivera completed seven innings recording six strikeouts while allowing two runs on four hits and two walks PERIOD

However Riveras efforts on the mound werent enough to secure the win PERIOD

One of the best outings of his career Mulvey said about Rivera PERIOD He pitched very well despite the loss PERIOD Certainly well enough to get the win but we couldnt score while he was out there. villanova struggled defensively in the second game making two crucial errors that resulted in two unearned runs allowed by junior pitcher Cade Udell PERIOD

Udell had a solid outing despite these unearned runs finishing with two strikeouts in . innings while only allowing one hit and zero earned runs PERIOD

On the offensive side junior second baseman Cameron Hassert continued his hot streak at the plate as he went  with one RBI and one run scored PERIOD This included a huge home run in the seventh that tied the game at the time PERIOD

However Hassert suffered a broken finger prior to this hit which held him out for the next game and potentially future games PERIOD

Later that day the Cats stepped on the field for their third game in the series where they seemed to collapse suffering a  loss PERIOD

This  weekend against Iona brings the Cats to a  overall record as they head into the Liberty Bell Classic PERIOD

Villanova will take the field again this coming weekend for a threegame set against the  Georgetown Hoyas PERIOD
