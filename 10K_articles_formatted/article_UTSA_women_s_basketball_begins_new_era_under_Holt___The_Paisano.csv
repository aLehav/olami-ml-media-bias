A Swifties analysis of  Taylors Version

Following a  season in which they went  the UTSA womens basketball team hopes to improve this season and achieve their first winning record since  PERIOD After combining for only  wins over the last two seasons this Runners team is a mix of both experienced players and talented underclassmen who are poised to make a run for a ConferenceUSA championship PERIOD

UTSA will seek to improve their ability to win at home as they only managed a  record at the Convocation Center PERIOD Home court advantage is a key component to any successful season UTSAs inability to establish an advantage last season was a contributing factor to another losing season PERIOD If they can turn their mediocre performance at home into an undeniable home court advantage the Runners will exceed expectations this season PERIOD

Another area of concern from last season was UTSAs poor record in conference play PERIOD Even though they were able to finish conference play with a winning record of  the eight losses kept the Runners from being serious contenders in ConferenceUSA PERIOD In order to have any shot at a conference championship this season UTSA will need to improve their conference record PERIOD

Looking ahead to this season UTSA will be without their two leading scorers from the  season PERIOD Leading scorer Lauryn Goodwin averaged . points per game along with . assists per game she transferred to Oklahoma State PERIOD Second leading scorer Tesha Smith averaged . points per game and . rebounds and was one of two graduating seniors from last season PERIOD To make up for this loss UTSA will look to seniors Crystal Chidomere and Carlie Heineman to lead the charge PERIOD During their junior season this dynamic duo averaged . points per game collectively PERIOD If UTSA hopes to have a competitive season Chidomere and Heineman will need to step their game up while leading a team laden with young talent PERIOD

So far this season the Runners have compiled a  record PERIOD Their first regular season game was a dominant victory over Sul Ross State a game in which UTSA never trailed PERIOD The Runners leading scorer sophomore Marie Benson scored  points on a scintillating  percent shooting performance PERIOD However Benson did not carry the load alone as this was a complete team victory PERIOD UTSAs bench outscored the Sul Ross State bench by a whopping 45point margin PERIOD Overall this was a complete drubbing as the Runners would go on to win by  points PERIOD

UTSA did not fare as well however in their second game of the season PERIOD The Runners traveled to Tempe Arizona to take on the Arizona State Sun Devils PERIOD Out of the gate UTSA did not stand a chance against ASU PERIOD Benson was again the leading scorer contributing  points in an ugly loss PERIOD

The UTSA Runners have plenty of reasons to be optimistic about this upcoming season PERIOD They have a potent mixture of both senior leadership and young talent PERIOD They will look to turn heads in conference play and make a run for a conference title PERIOD The Runners return home Nov PERIOD  to take on UT Arlington PERIOD
