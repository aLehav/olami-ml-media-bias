Manny RamirezFernando Gallo

The biggest chump and most irritating future firstballot HallofFamer is Manny Ramirez PERIOD Who else combines clutch hitting and a knack for driving runs in with childish behavior irresponsible comments and general eccentricity like ManRam

You know that guy who shows up late to class every day sits in the back talks during lecture and never does his homework Imagine that guy becoming one of the highestpaid athletes in sports with two World Series rings and you get Manny PERIOD

Make no mistake about his talent  Manny is one of the most fearsome hitters in baseball PERIOD Its a given that hell hit  homers and drive in  runs a year plus hes never finished a season below . pERIOD He also has the most career grand slams of any active player in the big leagues PERIOD Manny treats base runners like a good designated driver  he always gets them home PERIOD

But the guy also looks as ridiculous as a fake tan in January PERIOD His uniform hangs so loose that he could probably jump out of an airplane and float down safely to the ground PERIOD

And you can always look forward to his onagain offagain trade demands as the season progresses seeking attention like a highmaintenance girlfriend PERIOD When Mannys not flipflopping between begging to leave and professing his love for Boston hell also occasionally do something clever or hilarious like leave the field during a pitching change to relieve himself inside the Big Green Monster at Fenway Park PERIOD And dont forget about the time he held up a sign in the outfield during the game no less that read Just Manny Being Manny. chump seems like too kind of a word for this doofus sometimes PERIOD

The Red Sox recently visited the White House and President George W PERIOD Bush made a joke at Mannys expense since the outfielder was absent from the ceremony PERIOD If Bush can make fun of you and get away with it theres no way youre not the biggest chump in sports PERIOD

Mike TysonCameron Ross

For all his glory Mike Tyson had more abysmal moments than triumphant ones especially in his later years PERIOD This is why he is the ultimate chump of sports PERIOD

His most recent debacle involved his barbaric chomp of Evander Holyfields ear PERIOD Supposedly Tyson was fed up with Holyfields head butting which is understandable as Holyfield acts like a ram fighting in the ring PERIOD

Tysons biting was still awful for his career and his personal wellbeing PERIOD

Tysons natural talent and raw determination from his early career may be unsurpassed by any boxer but his hipitched lisp and facial tattoos will never be surpassed PERIOD

He grew up on the streets of Brooklyn and by age  had been arrested  times PERIOD His brief stretch of success involved Cus DAmato who acted as his fatherfigure and mentor but he died in  PERIOD

After Tysons loss to James Buster Douglas he began a downward spiral in life PERIOD He married the arguably mediocre actress Robin Givens who was the first of many to screw over Tyson PERIOD

After trouble with the law over spousal abuse Tyson quickly returned to the courts where he was convicted on rape charges PERIOD The victim former Miss Black Rhode Island Desiree Washington was rumored to have accused a man of rape before Tyson.When in jail Tyson tried to copy Muhammad Ali his hero by converting to Islam and adopting the name Malik Abdul Aziz PERIOD Smooth move except no one refers to him by that name PERIOD Its not very original either PERIOD

In the ring Tyson began looking for onepunch knockouts and headhunted like a skull collector PERIOD He didnt take fights seriously and his loss to the  underdog Jabba erJames Buster Douglas is one of the most embarrassing in history PERIOD

Tyson declared bankruptcy in  and has apparently squandered  million over the course of his career PERIOD

At one point he bought a tiger and took pictures with it on a leash while he sported nothing but underwear PERIOD This was a pathetic attempt to promote his masculinity and he looked more primitive like Beast Master PERIOD

There was a TV movie made about his life where the line Who ate my ice cream became unfortunately famous PERIOD

Tyson is the sad shell of a boxer who was the youngest heavyweight champion of all time and has said that his life is a waste and he wants to be a missionary PERIOD

He could have been the best boxer ever if he never associated with Don King and basically every other idiot that gave him bad advice andor used and abused him PERIOD

Iron Mike will always have a negative image in the view of sports fans because of his lack of control PERIOD

Jose CansecoJordan Guinn

The word chump seems insufficient when you are talking about Jose Canseco a wifebeating gunwaving and juicing egomaniac whose only motivation is selfinterest PERIOD

This is a man who was on house arrest and auctioned off time with himself on eBay PERIOD The only person more pathetic than Canseco is the blob of DNA that spent his money bidding on a day with him PERIOD

Canseco to my great misery is the first player in major league history to record  home runs and  stolen bases in the same season PERIOD He did it in  the year he won the MVP over Mike Greenwell PERIOD

During a taping of Pros vs PERIOD Joes a show on FX that pits former athletes against regular guys Canseco suggested that the joes take steroids to be able to hit like him PERIOD

Somehow the nickname I have for Canseco jackass meathead is not strong enough diction to capture my contempt and hatred for the Godfather of the steroid era. he wrote Juiced because he wanted money a common theme in his life PERIOD His other motive for the book was that he knew that he wasnt going to make the Hall of Fame so he decided to drag everyone else down with him PERIOD

Right now Canseco is still in the spotlight for a barbecue he hosted in  PERIOD The party is the center of the Roger Clemens controversy as Canseco said that Clemens didnt attend PERIOD Allegedly there is a photo of Clemens at the party and a former teammate of both men has described an incident from the party in which Clemens wife and Cansecos exwife compared their breast augmentations PERIOD Hopefully Canseco will be exposed for what he is and will be held in contempt of court and perjury PERIOD I am not in favor of Congress being involved with baseball but in Cansecos case I will make an exception PERIOD

Even though he has fewer brain cells than muscles Canseco has managed to make chumps of his teammates Congress and the American people PERIOD

Gilbert ArenasAlexander Villanueva

What can you say about a man who has only played eight games this season That man of course is Gilbert Arenas PERIOD And for any of you who forgot what team Arenas plays for he plays for the Washington Wizards PERIOD

He has been out of action from knee surgery early in the season and is looking forward to playing again sometime this season PERIOD

Although Arenas is arguably one of the top five point guards in the league he has also proven to be selfcentered outside of the basketball court PERIOD

Arenas had stated before one of his games in the regular season that he would score  points and he ended the night scoring only a miserable eight PERIOD This is the same man who was injured last season and when his team was in the playoffs he decided to tell the media that he was going to be on the cover of the new NBA Live  game instead of talking about how his team performed that night PERIOD

Sure maybe I should cut him some slack for being injured and all but he is an NBA star and he should know that making stupid decisions like that can not only hurt his team but also his chances of getting a contract extension even though hes earning close to  million this season PERIOD

It also doesnt help that he is currently injured so chances are that he can no longer get that extension he was hoping for if he plans to opt out of his contract after this season PERIOD

Even though Arenas was drafted into the league in the second round of the NBA Draft it doesnt mean that he can start claiming when he will return without getting an official report of when he can return to playing PERIOD

But despite Arenas off the court activities he clearly wants to play again and prove to the world that he is worth more than  million but that means he would have to score  points per game for every game left this season and I know that Arenas doesnt have that much ability with weak knees right now PERIOD

But things could be worse for Arenas He could be ballhogging Ron Artest PERIOD

Kelvin SampsonJustin Tejada

My vote for the biggest chump would have to go to Kelvin Sampson PERIOD Mr PERIOD Blue Shirt has raised so many red flags with the NCAA prior to his move to Indiana that its a wonder why they bothered to hire him at all PERIOD

I guess you could make the argument that Indiana was desperate to find a new coach after the resignation of Mike Davis and that they were somewhat blinded by Sampsons achievements on the sideline but you gotta think that a guy who placed his team and campus under investigation by the NCAA for three years is bound to have some problems later down the road PERIOD Heck the guy was prohibited to recruit offcampus and make recruitment phone calls for a year and he was still on that probation when he tucked his tail between his legs and left Oklahoma for Indiana in March  PERIOD

He hadnt even warmed up to his new chair before he was up to his old hijinks again PERIOD He just couldnt keep his hand out of the cookie jar PERIOD He already had his fun with breaking the rules and being highly unethical so I guess it was time to ramp the notch up a little and dabble on the side with some thievery PERIOD

During the summer he stole star player Eric Gordon and had him sign with Indiana despite Gordons previous verbal commitment to Illinois coach Bruce Weber PERIOD That might not have been a recruiting violation but thats just a dirty low blow and you can be sure that he caught a whole lot of flak for that by pretty much every coach in the nation PERIOD

And lets not forget the money he bilked out of Indiana PERIOD He just strolled onto the Hoosiers made a mess of things there by committing some fiveodd major rules violations and countless other recruitment violations and walked away with a cool  as a settlement for not suing Indiana with the wrongful termination of his contract PERIOD

The mans either a thief and a troublemaker or the luckiest dolt ever to keep repeating the same offenses over and over again while actually coming out on top PERIOD All I have to say is that its a shame he still gets to keep wearing that blue shirt as opposed to the orange jumpsuit a man of his caliber should be wearing PERIOD
