7888,2023-11-01,"over the past three years in America there have been exactly  mass shootings recorded by the Gun Violence Archive PERIOD These separate incidents have resulted in a total of  lives lost and over  people hospitalized PERIOD In Australia a country that underwent a series of reforms to curb gun violence there have been zero mass shootings in the last three years PERIOD In the United Kingdom there have been none PERIOD And in Germany also none PERIOD Once again America is number one and as of now there is little chance of another nation catching up PERIOD

America is the only international power where this is happening and we are doing very little to stop it PERIOD Each mass shooting overshadows the one before and the public has come to accept them as a sad thing that just happens PERIOD In the past two years over  children have become casualties to gun violence PERIOD This sort of thing should not just happen. america needs to be disgusted by firearms at this pointour president isbut even as President Obama struggles to pass executive orders some call him a tyrant PERIOD America has a problem and that problem is the Second Amendment PERIOD

Even the smallest efforts to curb gun violence are stopped at every turn with cries about upholding this part of the Constitution PERIOD The truth is we dont deserve a right to bear arms and saying this could get me shot in certain parts of the country PERIOD I grew up in Kentucky and Nebraska I have seen firsthand an American subculture that practically worships guns PERIOD Hell I once went on a church retreat called Guys Guns and God PERIOD I have fired pistols Uzis and fully automatic machine guns and I get that its fun PERIOD But no matter how responsible you are there is always someone who isnt PERIOD Irresponsibility with firearms can and will kill those around you PERIOD We are only  days into  and there have already been  gunrelated injuries or deaths across the country according to the Gun Violence Archive PERIOD

With the repeated striking down of legislation antiregulation groups like the National Rifle Association have assured the only way this violence can be stopped is through complete disarmament PERIOD It is too easy to get a weapon and none of the regulations that are getting through Congress have any hope of stopping that PERIOD Highpower firearms are commonly bought online and at gun conventions without any kind of background check in the vast majority of states PERIOD Even then a  investigation by CNBC and the Center for Responsive Politics revealed that there are still parties who spend upwards of  million annually lobbying to reduce legislation even further PERIOD Without purchase getting a gun is still laughably easy PERIOD One out of every three families in America has at least one firearm according to the Pew Research Center and oftentimes those are not even secured PERIOD Because of this the United States Bureau of Justice reports that over  firearms are stolen from homes every year PERIOD

Things were very much the same in Australia during the late 90s guns were cheap and readily available PERIOD Then however a man committed the largest mass shooting in history the Port Arthur massacre PERIOD The perpetrator legally purchased hundreds of rounds of ammunition and two assault rifles before going on a killing spree PERIOD He murdered  people including children as young as  years old PERIOD The government had enough PERIOD Australia initiated a compulsory buyback program where they purchased and destroyed over half a million firearms from its citizens PERIOD This had a definite effectnot only have there been no mass shootings since but due to the buyback program the  weapon that was used in the Sandy Hook massacre can now only be purchased illegally for upwards of  PERIOD Australia was able to make a change but unfortunately Americas devotion to the Second Amendment remains a major obstacle PERIOD

Earlier this month Obama outlined a series of executive orders on gun control including moves to ensure that every firearm purchase consists of a background check PERIOD The president explained in his article published in The New York Times that he seeks to crack down on firearm companies who have virtual immunity from the law thanks to the efforts of gun lobbyists PERIOD Many in this country however are still fighting for reform efforts PERIOD But if we want to end gun violence perhaps we need to change our rights PERIOD We lost our privileges to guns one thousand seventy three strikes and youre out PERIOD I would say enough is enough but if hundreds of thousands of incidents arent enough for the American public and lawmakers then I dont know what ever will be PERIOD
