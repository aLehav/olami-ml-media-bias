We managed to sit down together and tell stories about our lives and wrap that around the songs that we sing Foster said PERIOD

Out of the discussion came the format of its show which consists of storytelling and song swapping PERIOD After its first few shows the trio realized how much they enjoyed performing together and wanted to keep it going PERIOD
