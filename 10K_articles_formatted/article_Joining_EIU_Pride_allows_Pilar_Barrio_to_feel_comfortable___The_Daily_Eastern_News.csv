EIU Prides purpose is to allow students to feel comfortable and to provide a safe space PERIOD Members of the Registered Student organization RSO host activities for students throughout the year PERIOD One of the events that the group is currently planning is a prom PERIOD

This is going to be the second promthemed event that the RSO is hosting PERIOD

Barrio said EIU Pride wants to give people a chance to just go to prom in case they never got the chance to because of COVID19 or to just go again PERIOD

As president Barrio helps orchestrate events PERIOD She also has to coordinate the RSOs meetings PERIOD

She does not pay attention to titles though PERIOD Since everyone helps each other out she does not think that the titles are not as important as getting the work done PERIOD

Barrio said she originally joined EIU Pride so she could be included in other activities PERIOD

She was a player on the womens soccer team but currently helps manage the team PERIOD

Athletes tend to spend a lot of time together and Barrio said she wanted to go out and meet other people PERIOD

Usually I just hang out with athletes and thats something that I didnt like in the sense of wanting to explore more things and kind of see what Ive been missing on campus Barrio said PERIOD

Barrio also said the people made her feel comfortable when she first joined and the comfortability increased the longer she was in EIU Pride PERIOD

Slowly I could tell that there were people that I could relate with in so many different things Barrio said PERIOD It helped me get out of that routine PERIOD They treat me great and Im super thankful that I joined and got out of my comfort zone. barrio said she was very busy when she first joined the RSO PERIOD

While having to manage soccer and her job as the clinical assistant at the Center for Gender and Sexual Diversity which each require  hours a week of work and school work she said she was very stressful PERIOD

She said her teammates and new friends in EIU Pride allowed her to feel comfortable PERIOD Members in Pride allowed her to feel welcomed PERIOD

She said when she originally joined the RSO she was scared because she had never met any of the people that were already members and did not know what to expect PERIOD

When she first came to Eastern she did not have to try to make friends since her teammates were already her friends PERIOD

Barrio is from Cobena Spain and when she first came to Eastern she said the transition was hard for her PERIOD

At first I was really lost I was in another country I didnt know how things worked and stuff like that  and I was exposed to so many different people. barrio also said that joining EIU Pride allowed her to find herself PERIOD

It led me to kind of find myself and be myself and feel more comfortable with who I was Barrio said PERIOD

Barrio said that she did not know how people would feel when she told them that she planned on joining Pride PERIOD

Barrio said she understand when someone first comes to a school that they might try to fit in and figure everything out and make friends but knows that part is hard PERIOD

She thinks that it would be great for people to be more open minded and try out different RSOs PERIOD

Getting involved and meeting new people is going to really enhance your experience at EIU so I welcome everyone to come to pride meets or the GSD Center every day Barrio said PERIOD
