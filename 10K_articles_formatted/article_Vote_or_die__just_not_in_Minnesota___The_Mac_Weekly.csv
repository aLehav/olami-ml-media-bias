Open Letter to former Macalester President Brian Rosenberg

Last year when some dude from another dorm ralphed all over one of my floors toilets I didnt think Jackson Pollack PERIOD I thought douchebag PERIOD

People in the South were not fans of carpetbaggers when that whole thing was going on PERIOD It wasnt always because those Southerners were redneck racists PERIOD They just resented outsiders coming in and meddling in their world PERIOD

When election day rolls around all those people who care so much about our world take it upon themselves to enact their passion for political involvement on me in ways that completely fail to turn me on PERIOD

Paternalism never fails to rear its ugly head at Mac Why would anyone not want to take a stand against the right wing monster

Because I have issues with imposing myself in an election where Im just a visitor Because I care about politics in my own stateWhy are these not acceptable criticisms When you really break it down the space of legitimately debatable issues at Macalester is way too small PERIOD Voting in local elections is not in that space PERIOD

Im going to be in Minnesota for maybe four years PERIOD Im just not about imposing myself on the dumb townies because I know better PERIOD Just because youre in Minnesota doesnt mean you cant be a carpetbagger PERIOD

No matter what happens in Minnesota politics we will still be able to find refuge in our Macalester bubble PERIOD Not much generally changes in here other than the odd athletic facility and favorable mention in Newsweek PERIOD

Most of St PERIOD Paul and Minnesotas residents are here for the long haul while most Mac students arent PERIOD They just care very passionately about whats growing in their neck of the woods PERIOD

I dont know that its right for me stick my two cents where its not wanted PERIOD Sure its legal but is it just Please at least ask yourself this question before availing yourself of the political system here PERIOD

And dont forget your roots PERIOD I was born and raised in Hawaii and there are vital political issues at stake there like an identity crisis within the Democratic Party PERIOD My mother and most of my family will probably live out the rest of their lives there so the states future is important to me PERIOD

For example I dont want a faux Democrat in Congress who aims to represent the new Hawaii read Caucasian haoles and rich landowners PERIOD

Dont lose sight of your home and dont stop lending your voice there just because someones heart bleeds Minnesota because the odds are yours doesnt PERIOD
