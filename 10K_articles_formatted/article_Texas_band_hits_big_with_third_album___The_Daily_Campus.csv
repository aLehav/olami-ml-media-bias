8266,2023-10-25,"after years of jumping from town to town writing music and making memories the Eli Young Bands ride to fame has been any Texans dream come true PERIOD Whether they are getting kicked out of hotels for their playful humor or opening for the Dave Matthews Band their music has made a lasting impression PERIOD

The Eli Young Band has people turning up the volume to their third album Jet Black and Jealous released on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Eight days later Jet Black and Jealous entered the Billboard Top Country Albums Chart at No PERIOD  and No PERIOD  on the Top Current Albums Chart PERIOD

By the likes of the SMU crowd at the Granada on Oct PERIOD  for a private party hosted by Sigma Alpha Epsilon featuring the Eli Young Band it was evident that the bands persistence has made a lasting influence on listeners from every background PERIOD The concert awed the crowd with songs from their new album as well as fan favorites such as Oklahoma Girl and When it Rains. after seeing the band perform Jet Black and Jealous live there is no question the album will be a hit across the country said student Devon Myers I find the lyrics very relatable to the ups and downs of everyday life. originally from Denton band members embraced their Texas roots to create a unique country sound with a rock n roll edge PERIOD Vocalist Mike Eli guitarist James Young bass player Jon Jones and drummer Chris Thompson met while attending the University of North Texas in  where they began their musical journey writing songs and practicing in a friends garage PERIOD

All four of us came from different musical directions PERIOD When we started writing and playing together we absorbed each others music said Thompson PERIOD Each of our musical backgrounds had a huge effect on the kinds of songs we were writing and how our sound began to develop. after the release of their first album Level in  it was clear the band had an innate ability to relate to their fan base through honest lyrics and zealous performances PERIOD Following the music video release of When it Rains a song about optimism in the face of heartache the Eli Young Band was featured on CMT Country Music Television GAC Great American Country Country Weekly Guitar One and Billboard PERIOD Rerecorded When it Rains is the first track on Jet Black and Jealous and is the longest running independent single on the Billboard Charts PERIOD

Similar to Level Jet Black and Jealous incorporates the same degree of honesty in each of the songs yet epitomizes the common theme of optimism to a greater extent PERIOD All  songs reflect the bands outlook and philosophies on life by portraying actual characters that exude confidence and resilience PERIOD Songs like Mystery in the Making Get in your Car and Drive and Guinevere all focus on the future with a positive attitude  something that EYB has always managed to demonstrate PERIOD

After working with producers Mike Wrucke and Frank Liddell on Jet Black the band members perfected every song down to the very last word PERIOD Unlike most bands releasing their first national album EYB had complete creative control of every song PERIOD Their talents surpassed expectations and will likely continue to rise on Billboard Charts PERIOD

The Eli Young Band will be performing live in Dallas on Friday Oct PERIOD  at the ATT Plaza at the American Airlines Center at  p.m PERIOD In addition they will be playing in Fort Worth on Friday Oct PERIOD  at Billy Bobs Texas at  p.m PERIOD
