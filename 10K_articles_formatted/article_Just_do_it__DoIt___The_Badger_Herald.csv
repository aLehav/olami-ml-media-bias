2764,2007-10-09,"last spring the University of Wisconsin took a bold stand against the Recording Industry Association of America refusing to forward prelitigation settlement offers on to UW students who had used university Internet connections for illegal filesharing PERIOD

The RIAA would not actually back up its threats with legal action the thought process went and so UW  unless forced to do so by subpoena  would not help the RIAAs case by forwarding settlement letters seeking thousands of dollars in damages to students PERIOD

It turns out UW was wrong PERIOD

The RIAA has in fact made good on its threats to pursue file sharers aggressively PERIOD

One UW student speaking on condition of anonymity told The Badger Herald last week that her decision not to immediately settle  acting on UWs legal advice  ended up costing her  more than the original terms offered by the RIAA PERIOD

Though one can certainly challenge the wisdom or efficacy of the RIAAs tactics it is the actions of UW and its Division of Information Technology that actually concern us more PERIOD Despite clinging to an outdated and failing business model it seems to us the RIAA is on the legal and indeed moral high ground PERIOD It should not be ignored that the students UW has been fighting to protect did in all likelihood knowingly break the law PERIOD Although the victim in this case is a giant recording industry and the perpetrator is a lowly college student and not vice versa stealing is stealing and should be treated as such PERIOD

 DoIT Interim CIO Ken Frazier told the Herald adding that he thinks it is  for the RIAA to pin the downloading problem on college students PERIOD

Statements like these leave us shaking our heads wondering why DoIT and the UW legal team are expending so much time and effort on protecting students  the vast majority of whom are adults  from the consequences of their illegal actions PERIOD UW still for example will only forward an RIAA settlement offer on to offending students who explicitly request it PERIOD

Despite their misgivings about the recording industry UW and DoIT should step out of the picture and stop interfering with the judicial process PERIOD Its not clear theyre doing the offending students any good anyway PERIOD
