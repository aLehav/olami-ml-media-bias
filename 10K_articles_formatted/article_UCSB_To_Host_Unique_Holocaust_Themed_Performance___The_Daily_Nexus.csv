4127,2006-11-09,"between studying for midterms prepping for all the good prefinals parties and waiting in line for Jon Stewart tickets UCSB students have plenty going on in the next few weeks PERIOD With that said there is one upcoming Arts  Lectures presentation that is worth stopping to check out  even if it isnt quite as fun or funny as Jon Stewarts impending appearance PERIOD Tonight Arts  Lectures will present two performance pieces created by renowned Canadian theater professor producer and director Judy Kopelow PERIOD The first piece White Rose will memorialize a group of students at the University of Munich  including the renowned Sophie Scholl and UCSBs own Dr PERIOD Whittenstein  who published leaflets protesting the Nazis and eventually imprisoned punished and often killed because of it PERIOD The second piece Children of a Vanished World focuses on a group of photos of Jewish children from Eastern Europe taken by Roman Vishniac during the 1930s as an attempt to capture these children before the Nazis killed them and their communities PERIOD According to Kopelow both pieces are designed to memorialize the children and students who lost their lives during the Holocaust and to ensure that the atrocities of the Holocaust are never repeated PERIOD Recently Artsweek sat down with Kopelow this week and got her take on White Rose and Children of a Vanished World. what exactly can students expect to see at the event
Kopelow So what we basically do in Children of a Vanished World is that the entire book of photographs is performed PERIOD So on one side of the stage is a violinist cellist clarinetist and a soprano and tenor and piano and they perform a collection of childrens songs from that time in the book and then in the middle of stage is the images projected PERIOD Its usually at least  by  feet PERIOD They sort of make the children come alive in sort of an eerie way PERIOD And on the other side of the stage is a narrator and the narration puts a historical context of these small Jewish communities in the photographs PERIOD And also theres a collection of childrens poetry that we reciteits sort of at the same time a tragic remembrance of the loss of life and at the same time a real celebration of these childrens lives and their potential that was lost PERIOD In White Rose the piece tells the story of two of the members of White Rose a brother and sister  Hunt and Sophie Scholl PERIOD They represent all of White Rose it just so happens the composer decided to have a dialogue between the brother and sister and they reflect on their life while preparing for death PERIOD Its contemporary music but theres something about it thats so accessible and it just makes you just feel like youre part of something right when youre part of this opera PERIOD

Why did you decide to stage these two particular works
Kopelow  With the children piece I literally came across it PERIOD Im going to admit it they were on sale in the bookstore here and I had to buy  presents and they were in a big pile and it was like they were put in front of me PERIOD And I literally opened it and I said to myself I am going to stage this book and I am going to bring these childrens faces out of the book PERIOD It just became a mission of love these childrens facesthey were in my head all the time PERIOD I mean I would dream about themWhite Rose I had never gone to the Holocaust Museum in Washington and I went as you leave the museum you know the wall with all the righteous gentiles theres a photo on the wall of the White Rose members and then I read about this group and I just thought Who are these people When I went home I started to Google about it and I found there was this oneact opera composed about this group and I call the conductor I work with if you come to the production the other thing that was very interesting is the soprano that sings the part of Sophie Ive worked with her for six years and shes the exact same face as Sophie Scholl PERIOD Its like the same person and she has a voice that can sing it beautifully PERIOD

Why should UCSB students go see this production
Kopelow I think for both of them its sort of interesting theyre different age spectrums in a way PERIOD For the children it was children of all ages certainly university students too that were annihilated and werent allowed to reach their potential and I think as students we have an obligation to remember what was lost so these things arent repeated and also a respectful remembrance and to learn from these lives that were snuffed out so early PERIOD The White Rose is a clear message for students that these were students who rose way above the bar in terms of their response to wrongdoing in their midst and they are an extraordinary example of what we can become PERIOD
