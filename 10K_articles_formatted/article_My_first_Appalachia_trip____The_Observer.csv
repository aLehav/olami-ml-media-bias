Ankur Chawla  Tuesday March  

Every spring and fall break the Center for Social Concerns sends students across the Appalachian region and various urban centers to understand and try to help with the poverty in the region PERIOD But as Im sure everyone whos ever gone on one of the trips knows we come back with so much more than the feeling of service PERIOD

I have been lucky enough to attend a spring seminar each of the past two years working in New Orleans La. and Big Creek W.Va. respectively with each trip being uniquely awesome PERIOD This column is a tribute to those moments that make me eager to head back next fall PERIOD

Nothing epitomizes these times than Tuesday night this past week PERIOD Our service group was entertained by the always classy sounds of bluegrass music performed by a man named Chester and taught how to dance by his musical partner Manuel PERIOD Donning a green hat with Flatfooter across the top Manuel moved across the floor like butter on a fry pan PERIOD

The professional dancer was kind enough to show us his moves both on the floor and with the ladies PERIOD And Manuel wasnt just light on his feet when listening to bluegrass he was more than happy to smang it with us and whip his hair back and forth PERIOD He even did the dreaded broom dance literally pretending a broom was his dance partner PERIOD

Meanwhile Chester played his guitar and sang songs the likes of When the Rooster Came on the Farm pun intended and Penicillin Penny referring to a woman that may require you go see a pharmacist PERIOD These hilarious parodies served more than to get a few cheap laughs from us students  they created an instant bond through humor and music PERIOD

These antics while incredibly fun opened the door to serious conversation about the poverty and problems of rural Appalachia PERIOD Chester was able to open up and let us in to his thoughts and beliefs PERIOD This encounter was so characteristic of the entire trip PERIOD Being able to have an incredible time and a lot of fun while still helping and showing concern for the problems of the area PERIOD

Whats truly amazing about the Appalachia seminars is this very balance PERIOD Those of us on the trip were able to enjoy ourselves making thats what she said jokes and being utterly awful at basketball while at the same time having serious discussions of what our role in the region and in service is PERIOD Its hard to imagine throwing together  random students for a week could be a venue for making some of my closest friends at this university but thats exactly what happened these past two years PERIOD I hope those of you reading this even if it is just the  others who served with me in Big Creek will take the opportunity to participate in one of the CSCs seminars PERIOD I can personally guarantee it will be one of the best weeks youve ever had PERIOD
