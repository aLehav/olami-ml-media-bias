7031,2021-03-13,"pressure luck and perfect execution led to an AllAmerican season for Iowa gymnast Mike Jiang PERIOD

The junior ended the NCAA championships on April  as the only Hawkeye on the mens gymnastics team to earn the status with a seventhplace finish on the pommelhorse in West Point N.Y PERIOD

When I first found out I was an AllAmerican I was like Wow doesnt life seem surreal right now  Jiang said PERIOD I didnt expect to go anywhere with my pommelhorse routine at the beginning of the year. iowa head coach Tom Dunn credited Jiangs health during the final stretch of the season to the change PERIOD He said Jiang showed more consistency in his routine at the end of the year and excelled at the NCAA championships because it PERIOD

But Jiang said some fortune helped as well

I thought I was pretty lucky to make it the first day Jiang said of his . score that earned him twentieth place on April  PERIOD On Friday I just realized that I made it and I have nothing to lose PERIOD I put myself in a relaxed mindset and realized I was just competing for myself and not the team and went out and got in the zone. his April  qualifying pommel horse score of . a season high for both Jiang and Iowa  earned him a seventhplace finish which he also received at the of the individual championships on April  PERIOD

Going into the finals I knew I was top  and all I needed was a topeight finish to be an AllAmerican the Littleton Colo. native said PERIOD Then I saw that the first three people fell and every time they did my heart jumped PERIOD All I had to do was hit was what went through my mind and then Id reach my goal. the  allarounder said he knew he had the routine and the form to gain AllAmerican status in pommel horse in the last month of the season but he also knew the event had been a weak link and inconsistent all year for Iowa PERIOD

Jiang was tied for No PERIOD  nationally on the event heading into the NCAA championships PERIOD

Dunn said he didnt expect Iowa to come away with an AllAmerican in the event that had given his team trouble throughout the season PERIOD

The pommel horse is a tough event for everyone not just us Dunn said PERIOD There were good guys who just choked ahead of Mike probably because they didnt handle the championship pressure very well PERIOD He took advantage of it and put in a great routine that hes been working on. the routine that led to Jiangs AllAmerican performance in New York was perfected in Iowa City PERIOD

The week of practice before the NCAA championships Jiang hit on nine of nine practice runs a first for the season PERIOD

Prior to the NCAA championships Iowa associate head coach Dmitri Trouch said Jiang had made progress since the Big Ten championship meet  days beforehand PERIOD

With a healthy body and consistency Jiang said he felt that he had peaked at the right time PERIOD He hopes to build on his allaround skills over the summer PERIOD

But his AllAmerican pommelhorse routine wont be enough for next season Jiang said PERIOD

With perfect form the gymnast said he believes his routine has maxed out scoringwise PERIOD He wants to add difficulty to the routine in the future to cap off his Iowa career with backtoback AllAmerican seasons PERIOD

The best thing about the NCAA championships is that I know its possible to perform so well with my abilities he said PERIOD Next year I want to be even better on the pommel horse and make us a team to beat in  PERIOD I wont get lucky again and I kind of expect to be an AllAmerican from now on.",Iowa gymnast earns All-American honors - The Daily Iowan,University of Iowa
