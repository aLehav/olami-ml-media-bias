6969,2023-11-03,"as I take a moment to reflect on my time on campus I can confidently say nothing went according to plan PERIOD That being said I am only now learning why thats okay PERIOD I would deem these last four years not what I was expecting but what I needed PERIOD As for my fellow  grads what some would call the best four years of your life looked a lot different for us PERIOD Having to decipher your purpose as a student while in a pandemic was pretty daunting and at times allconsuming PERIOD While I wouldnt trade the time I was able to spend with my mom and dad at home having to accept the fact that my college experience was going to be a lot different from what I originally intended was quite the mental task PERIOD So as I alluded to earlier while some may say college will be the best four years of your life I will forever argue that college will be the most formative four years of your life but not necessarily the best PERIOD

Having been on a few interviews recently only now has it set in that COVID19 took a great chunk of opportunity away from me PERIOD Having to have spent the entirety of my sophomore year behind a computer screen inundated with Zoom calls faulty wifi and personal grief I knew that when I came back I needed to give it everything I had to make up for lost time PERIOD

Inspired by the words of Lebron James after winning the  NBA Finals who said I set out a goal two years when I came back to bring a Championship to this city PERIOD I gave everything that I have. thats exactly what I did and oh yeah we won a Natty too and I had a hand in it or should I say paw

With the mantra in the back of my mind I came back to campus for my junior year with one goal and one goal only to chase big moments PERIOD I started out the year finally in my Sport Management program PERIOD I became a mascot and got Women in Sport off the ground and running again PERIOD I became an art minor where I found a creative outlet I was missing while on campus PERIOD And then I found The Daily Campus PERIOD Being able to write for the Sports section of the DC reminded me of why I wanted to work in the sport industry to begin with PERIOD Having had some initial experiences that started to cloud that passion having the opportunity to write freely about sports and the athletes I looked up to as a kid allowed me to rediscover my why. now that Ive finished all of my classes towards the Sport Management degree and acquiring a new perspective on things having been able to express myself as a fan at The Daily Campus helped me to better separate the two PERIOD

My senior year consisted of serving as the beat writer for the UConn womens soccer team working for the Sport Communication department mascotting in Houston where we brought back the chip and most importantly finding out more about myself as I navigated all the ups and downs PERIOD Yes I know its controversial but the chip isnt the most important thing and thats what I hope those who come after me realize too PERIOD Winning is such a small fraction of the time spent and if you cant love the process just as much as winning if not more you are going to have a hard time PERIOD I know I did PERIOD I wasnt patient and found myself forcing certain things in hopes that a better result would be the outcome but that wasnt the case PERIOD I needed to refocus my desires acknowledge the conditions I was wanting things to occur under and identified what was realistic PERIOD

To be completely transparent I still havent found the formula to it all and I dont think there really is one PERIOD So as we all continue to find what years will be the best for us for now Im content with knowing that the best is still out there and encourage anyone who is finding themselves in a rut to do the same PERIOD Figure out what you desire most collect the resources you may need to complete it which may just be yourself and have some fun with it PERIOD As weve all had to experience it in different ways throughout the lockdown life is fragile PERIOD So take the path youve always wanted to take but havent yet because of the fear PERIOD Show your friends how much you appreciate them take the photos and go to the games PERIOD Chase those big moments and get crafty when things arent going your way PERIOD

To wrap up when I was graduating high school the quote I left on a brick by the art wing was A true champion champions others. as I now get set to graduate college I would like to add A true champion champions others but must champion themselves in order to do so for others. its been a time UConn PERIOD Ill see you when I see you Katherine PERIOD
