Halloween II largely looks to repeat the same formula of last seasons Halloween by bringing back the bet between Captain Holt Andre Braugher and Jake Peralta Andy Samberg PERIOD In Halloween Jake bet he could steal Holts Medal of Valor from his office PERIOD If he did it Holt would do paperwork for a week and if he didnt Jake would do unpaid overtime for a week PERIOD

Of course the bet in Halloween II is similar to the previous bet but it ups the stakes Jake will steal Holts watch this year and if he doesnt he will put in fivedruple the overtime PERIOD Upping the stakes is a necessary plot device for any sequel since it provides people with a reason to watch PERIOD If the stakes werent higher they could rewatch the original and be done with it PERIOD

But Halloween II ups the stakes too much PERIOD Where Halloween became a story about a caper that brought the whole precinct together which is something that was sorely needed when it first aired Halloween II expands outside of the world of the precinct and loses much of the heart of Halloween. instead of focusing on the ensemble this episode is all about Jake PERIOD In some way this makes sense as he is the main character but much like Parks and Recreation and Community Brooklyn NineNine functions best when its focus is on the group PERIOD However Halloween was about the group coming together so Halloween II must do something else PERIOD

At first Jake calls the rest of the precinct in to brief them on the situation but he tells the group that they cant help him this year because Holt will expect that PERIOD Instead he brings in an outsider a pickpocket named Dan Fingers McCreery Apollo Robbins to do the dirty work PERIOD The rest of the team only serves as a distraction PERIOD

McCreery takes Holts watch without a hitch but trouble starts when he wont give the watch back to Jake PERIOD Then trouble keeps piling on and piling on and piling on PERIOD McCreery leaves the watch in Jakes car which gets towed. jake gives McCreery his shoes and has to walk around Brooklyn in socks PERIOD His wallet and badge get stolen which means he cant get his car out of the impound PERIOD

If it all sounds absolutely ridiculous and overthetop thats because it is PERIOD Its revealed at the end of the episode that Holt put the whole evening together with the help of the precinct to get back at Jake for winning the bet last year PERIOD Honestly this reveal was my favorite part of the episode PERIOD It was more than a little predictable because Jake is usually a competent detective so the way everything kept going wrong for him was fishy PERIOD Also unfortunate was the fact that Halloween II did bring everyone together  but against Jake which doesnt quite send the message of togetherness that I wanted it to PERIOD

Its not just the main plot where Halloween II falls down PERIOD The episodes one major subplot involves Gina Chelsea Peretti skipping out on filling the precincts Halloween buckets PERIOD This in itself is not a major shocker PERIOD Gina always tries to do as little work as possible but this plot never comes together as a cohesive whole PERIOD

First we learn that Gina skipped filling buckets to work on her dance moves PERIOD This is also pretty standard Gina and makes sense for the character but the episode takes it one notch too far when it adds another complication Gina has less time because shes also been attending college classes PERIOD

Its exciting that we get a new side to Gina whose character is one of the only main characters defined by one major personality trait  her lack of work ethic caused by an intense narcissism  so to see her working hard at something could be great character development PERIOD And its one thats not caused by her relationship with Boyle which is also good PERIOD

But its hard to tell when Gina is being serious and in an episode filled with nonserious things in the main plot it would have been nice to have some confirmation of her commitment to going to college since I kept expecting her to say shed been lying about the college classes PERIOD

Plot problems aside this episode of Brooklyn NineNine is like so many episodes of the show really funny PERIOD But it ultimately ends up funny in a vaguely enjoyable way not in a way that makes me want to tune in and watch the show every week PERIOD Brooklyn NineNine is normally funny in the latter sense so lets hope Halloween II is just a misstep along the shows largely successful path PERIOD
