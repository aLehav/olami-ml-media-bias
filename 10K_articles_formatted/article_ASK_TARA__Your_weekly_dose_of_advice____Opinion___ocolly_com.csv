Friend Zone

Dear Tara

Ive been best friends with this guy for years now PERIOD We do everything together and really enjoy spending time with each other PERIOD

Lately I feel like he may want more than just friendship PERIOD

I have never looked at him this way but I feel like I may be missing out on something great PERIOD

I know I need to talk to him about this situation but Im scared that if something more did happen and we didnt work out I might lose my friendship with him PERIOD

What should I do

Sincerely

Brother or Lover

Dear Possible Brother Lover

Do not force yourself into something you may be skeptical with in the first place PERIOD This could be misleading to your friend especially if you believe he likes you PERIOD

However once you decide to see if this relationship could become romantic confirm that he has the same feelings too PERIOD

To reassure he likes you I would suggest examining both body language and tones when you talk to each other PERIOD

Does his actions change ever so slightly when you talk to him

Dont be afraid to ask to go on a date as more than friends PERIOD

This is the number one piece of advice I can give you if you do not ask you will never know his true feelings and may miss out on a great romance PERIOD

Sincerely

Tara

Doctor Woo

Dear Tara

People are always criticizing the things I enjoy PERIOD

I tend to watch TV shows like Doctor Who that many of my friends find cheesy PERIOD

How do I make them stop criticizing my interests

Sincerely

Odd One Out

Dear Odd

You cannot help the things you enjoy PERIOD

My suggestion would be to introduce your friends to the TV shows you watch and explain why you like them PERIOD

I have friends who are puzzled whenever I want to watch reruns of Designing Women but they fail to realize I like the show because I have a nostalgic connection to it PERIOD

What you enjoy is completely harmless and should not be judged against PERIOD

If your acquaintances continue this behavior find others who are interested in the show and discuss it with them PERIOD

Your friendship does not have to revolve around something as simple as TV show

Sincerely

Tara

NotSoMild Manners

Dear Tara

I am currently dating somebody who was raised with true Southern values PERIOD

I absolutely adore him but he continually corrects me at dinner about etiquette holding fork improperly napkin in lap etc. pERIOD

I do not mind the lesson but I feel as if this is the beginning stage of him being controlling PERIOD

Should I be offended How important should etiquette be when dating

Improper Manners

Dear Manners

Embrace the etiquette

Everybody these days could use a lesson or two to become classier PERIOD

I say if it does not affect your own morals try it PERIOD

Having proper manners is a plus when it comes to dating PERIOD Put it in perspective would you want to date a slob

On the controlling part if he becomes a bit too Christian Grey for your tastes examine the relationship and conclude whether you could handle this part of his personality or not PERIOD

This could be a red flag for some people others may find this comforting PERIOD It really depends on you PERIOD

Sincerely

Tara
