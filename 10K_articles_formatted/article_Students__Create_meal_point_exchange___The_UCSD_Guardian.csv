6195,2023-10-08,"the El Mercado eatery recently opened on Muirs campus in the home of the former latenight Rathskaller PERIOD Although the newly established eatery has regrettably decided not to use the arteryclogging fryer that used to reside there it produces fresh and appetizing Mexican food nonetheless PERIOD This columnists informal survey of the menu finds that while the prices are a tad higher than what should be expected though this is hardly a surprise for a housing and dining services enterprise the vegetables are consistently crisp and juicy the seating is plentiful and open and there are couches to lounge on while digesting and waiting for ones next class PERIOD It is certainly more relaxing than the zoo that the Price Center has become regardless of what one may think about relentless fee referendum pushes the Price Center has undeniably become a fire hazard due to the sheer number of people stuffed into so small a space come lunchtime PERIOD

However the somewhat high prices about a dollar too expensive inspired another thought Why would freshmen buy overpriced lava lamps at Earls Place if they could instead get cash from upperclassmen willing to buy meal points at discount rates It could be some sort of commodities market  say it would be possible to sell  meal points for seven or eight real dollars PERIOD This would not only correct the price gap for offcampus students but would be more productive than lava lamp purchases for freshmen PERIOD Some may argue though that the meal points were bought by the parents of freshmen who want to regulate their spending habits to ensure that they actually would eat meals  but it seems that if the freshmen cannot be trusted not to blow their meal points on lava lamps anyways then they perhaps should not be trusted with college life or being a functioning adult in the first place PERIOD Too bad then that the meal point exchange market will never come to pass PERIOD

An email sent to the UCSD community by Dr PERIOD Watsons office of Student Affairs on Oct PERIOD  invited students staff and faculty to look over proposed changes to Policy and Procedures Manual section  PERIOD The changes are notable in that they seem to be a concrete expression of Dr PERIOD Watsons rumored longstanding opposition to alcohol at large student events PERIOD The reworded stipulations clearly make it more difficult not only to hold oncampus events but most notably explicitly rewords statements regarding regulations about alcohol companies sponsoring student events PERIOD The revisions seem dedicated to making it nearly impossible for such companies to in any way fund student concerts PERIOD

For good measure the proposed changes increase the amount of lead time before an event from three weeks to four and delegate authority for making exceptions to the rule higher up the ladder of university administration if only to make the procurement of the devils drink by UCSD minors all that more difficult PERIOD However the regulations now explicitly state that University sponsors must be clearly identified as the primary sponsor of the event PERIOD Manufacturers andor distributors of alcoholic beverages may not be primary sponsors of campus events. as some students involved in programming events for UCSD will tell you the reason a campus the size of UCSD does not get notable acts is solely because of this rather draconian clause in its alcohol policy that prevents alcohol manufacturers from blatantly sponsoring events PERIOD Apparently it seems a combination of Dr PERIOD Watsons rumored disapproval of beer gardens and university policy against explicit sponsoring serve to dissuade alcohol manufacturers from sponsoring good concert acts on UCSDs campus  some of which would not be even remotely obtainable regardless of money without the companys help  because they can get more visibility for their dollar elsewhere PERIOD While this columnist is no partisan for Bacchus literally not figuratively revelry on Library Walk a healthy active campus with popular musical acts and a tinge of a lack of sobriety is no doubt a good thing for the character of the university and the sanity of the student population PERIOD Also this would save on student fees or at least provide more bang for the dollar which Dr PERIOD Watson has been intent on raising for the past three years PERIOD

But then again students apparently cannot be trusted with alcohol  especially when theres an omnipresence of heavy security and immediate consequences to foolish actions PERIOD How unfortunate that the immediate consequences of foolish actions dont apply to those who would oppose liberalizing UCSDs alcohol policy for either fears of liability or protestations of morality PERIOD
