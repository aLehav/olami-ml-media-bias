NYU SLAM members made posters outlining how members of the board have ties to other industries that could be deemed a conflict of interest. alex Domb Deputy News EditorOct  

As NYU families and alumni poured into the Kimmel Center for University Life for President Andrew Hamiltons first State of the School address NYUs SLAM offered a different perspective on NYUs most senior administrators PERIOD

In response to Hamiltons past claims that adding a student to the Board of Trustees would be a conflict of interest several SLAM members rallied in Kimmel  holding posters that described various trustees alleged conflicts of interests PERIOD

Some trustees targeted in the protests included Anthony Welters whose fracking company corrupted and poisoned native communities John Paulson who got rich off of the  housing crisis and the Puerto Rican debt crisis and William Berkeley who got rich off of predatory student loans and fossil fuels. protesters aimed to inform parents and alumni who were visiting the school for Alumni Weekend and the intersecting Parents Day about their cause PERIOD The group asked supporters to sign an active petition to get a student representative on the board PERIOD

The protest was held in Kimmel to reach parents and alumni attending Hamiltons speech in NYUs Skirball Center for Performing Arts PERIOD SLAM hoped to influence NYU donors and inform them about trustees ulterior economic ties PERIOD

This is alumniparents weekend explained Gallatin senior and SLAM member Hannah Fullerton PERIOD So we want alumni and parents to know who is currently on our Board of Trustees and why for some reason we would be considered to have conflicts of interests on the board just by representing our constituency of students PERIOD Essentially were asking NYU to explain what its interests are and to let alumni and parents know  before they donate  that this is what our administration really looks like. fellow SLAM member and Gallatin sophomore Mia Wong framed the protests as a questioning of NYUs values PERIOD

Hamilton has said that getting a student on the Board of Trustees would be a conflict of interest Wong said PERIOD However this is our current Board of Trustees and they have lots of conflicts of interests including ties with fossil fuel investment companies student loan companies possibly ties to profiting off of the puerto rico debt crisis and to the  housing crisis. wong said that the purpose of the protest was to ask why placing a student on the board would be deemed a conflict of interest when current board members are not labeled as such PERIOD

What are NYUs interests Wong asked PERIOD

SLAM members described mixed reactions from parents and alumni PERIOD

Some have walked past without a care said Gallatin junior and SLAM member Tiger Kneller PERIOD But others are quite surprised especially when they realize the kinds of people who have a stake in this school and that the kind of people who are making decisions at NYU have a lot of dedication to institutions outside of NYU. kneller supported his position by explaining that  percent of the Board of Trustees is in the fields of real estate law and finance and only one member of the board has a background in education PERIOD

Some passersby have been very enthusiastic but hesitant to officially sign our petition but were hoping that by engaging them and by talking to them one on one they will support us Kneller said PERIOD The younger alumni seem a lot more enthusiastic than the older alumni  I think because they still have closer ties to NYU. michelle Caits NYU Class of  signed SLAMs petition yet remains doubtful about the potential impact PERIOD

Probably nothing will come out of the petition but a student representative wont be with big money Caits said PERIOD The point is that unless politicians see votes theyll do nothing  You ask someone for help you get two things silence or request for funds PERIOD So maybe a student representative would be supposedly less jaded or more idealistic PERIOD It cant hurt. while SLAM has enjoyed the support of several alumni thus far the group still hopes to recruit more undergraduate student support for its cause PERIOD

We hope that this gets out to current students Fullerton said PERIOD Because we know that of the  undergraduates most dont know that these are the people representing us and making decisions for us so we need to increase the base of people who even know why this campaign is happening. despite SLAMs desire for increased undergraduate support Kneller sees this particular movement as merely a step in the right direction rather than an end goal PERIOD She believes that a student on the board would act not only as a decision maker but also as a liaison between the board and the body it governs which would allow students to have more of a stake in their university PERIOD

Right now our only stake is the dollars we pay for tuition but we need to have a decisionmaking stake as well Kneller said PERIOD
