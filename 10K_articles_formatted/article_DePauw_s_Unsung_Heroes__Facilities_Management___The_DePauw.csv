When the sidewalks are covered in slick ice Facilities Management is there to save the campus community from the embarrassment and possible danger of falling PERIOD They spread salt over every sidewalk when the rain decides it wants to freeze and they scrape every sidewalk free from snow before the sun even has a chance to melt it PERIOD And yes they fix every burst pipe and leak when residents leave their windows open please close your windows PERIOD

While many students were indoors this past Sunday watching as our campus was covered in a fresh layer of snow a small army of Facilities Management workers was out making it possible for us to get safely from place to place PERIOD

And all of this work is in addition to their normal duties PERIOD Theyre the ones whocome at  a.m PERIOD to shut off your beeping CO2 alarm PERIOD Theyre the ones who make sure residence halls and campus are clean of trash PERIOD They are also the ones who send campuswide emails to alert the campus community of potential hazards thus aiming to keep us safe PERIOD

The amount and quality of work they do are admirable and sometimes goes unrecognized PERIOD DePauw Facilities Management thank you PERIOD
