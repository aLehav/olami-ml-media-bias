A sea of green for as long as the eye could see under the streetlights a cascade of fireworks exploding overhead and people climbing on telephone poles even though the police greased them with oil to prevent this this was the scene on Broad Street after the Philadelphia Eagles captured their first Super Bowl win in  over the New England Patriots and Tom Brady PERIOD

Something about that season just felt different PERIOD There was something special about that team that goes beyond mere comprehension PERIOD It was almost magical PERIOD From Carson Wentzs MVP play to his getting hurt in Week  to Nick Foles taking over and leading them on a historic run to winning Super Bowl MVP nobody expected Nick Foles to play the way that he did PERIOD That is why they were not favored going into the playoffs even though they would be at home and also the one seed PERIOD But this team never gives up and the nobody believes in us attitude perfectly encapsulates what sports mean to Philadelphia and its citizens PERIOD I think that is why the win resonated the way that it did PERIOD Philadelphia loves a good underdog story PERIOD Hence why Rocky is such a popular movie and why the Eagles donned dog masks all throughout their playoff run PERIOD

I think everybody perceives us as being the weakest and that is fine right tackle Lane Johnson said when he realized that the Eagles would be underdogs all throughout their playoff run PERIOD Feeling weak and having people count you out is something that everybody can relate to PERIOD Especially in Philadelphia where our fans have a reputation of being toxic or obnoxious. besides just providing the lesson in never giving up and proving others wrong this win was a moment that will never be forgotten by the fans PERIOD People have waited a lifetime to see their beloved Eagles hoist the Lombardi trophy and to see it actually happen must have been surreal PERIOD Hearing their stories told and having them reminisce fondly really makes you feel the impact that sports can have PERIOD

For me it was a moment Ill never forget PERIOD When we won me and my friends sprinted out of the house and ran up and down the streets with complete strangers chanting fly eagles fly PERIOD To be a part of this moment and being able to create a lifetime memory was truly something special. during that season the anticipation for the Super Bowl kept growing as the Eagles kept winning PERIOD I was so glad to have been able to see them win a Super Bowl in my lifetime and hopefully many more will come. these were quotes from lifelong Eagles fans Gemma Giuffrida and Gina Perricone who both grew up in the Philadelphia area PERIOD Now imagine those same feelings but amplified by the waiting of the majority of your life through the ups and downs and disappointing seasons then seeing the Hail Mary attempt from Tom Brady bobble around and fall helplessly to the grass PERIOD

You could see these feelings and its widespread impact at the Super Bowl parade days later PERIOD There were people of all ages basked in green cheering for their hometown team PERIOD Sports really brings people together like none other PERIOD

One thing is certain about Philadelphia it is and always will be a football city PERIOD
