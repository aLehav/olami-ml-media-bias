8824,2023-11-05,"the Board of Regents voted on June  to comply with federal IRS laws and recognize samesex marriages for participants within the University System of Georgias Optional Retirement Plan ORP according to the Atlanta JournalConstitution AJC PERIOD

John H PERIOD Millsaps Assistant Vice Chancellor of Strategic Communications at the Board of Regents said there are two plans offered to University System of Georgias USG employees  ORP and Teachers Retirement System of Georgia plan TRSGA PERIOD

The default program when youre hired is the teachers retirement system which handles retirement programs for not only K12 teachers but employees of the university system PERIOD They have a board that runs it and theyre responsible for managing that plan Millsaps said PERIOD





USG employees also have a onetime option to not accept the TRSGA retirement plan and optout for ORP that is run by the Board of Regents according to Millsaps PERIOD

If you USG employee choose that program then thats the program youre on he said PERIOD What the board had to do in June was because theyre responsible for the administration of that Optional Retirement Plan PERIOD They had to redefine the definition of spouse or surviving spouse to be in compliance with the federal tax law. about  employees at universities and colleges within the state participate in ORP according to the AJC PERIOD Georgia defines spouse as a union between a man and woman only PERIOD

The IRS retirement plan rules apply to people who were married in states where samesex marriage is recognized regardless of whether a person currently lives in a state such as Georgia where samesex marriage is not recognized Marion Fedrick the University Systems vice chancellor of human resources said to the AJC PERIOD

Millsaps said the vote only affects minimum distribution rules and roll overs which may affect federal tax liability upon the death of a spouse PERIOD

The board had to do that as a mandatory change to comply with IRS regulations PERIOD So it doesnt change eligibility requirements or any other programs that we offer he said PERIOD

USG employees who are in samesex relationships will not receive benefits such as health care coverage health benefits or dental insurance according to Millsaps PERIOD

When you enroll in a benefits program like this or a retirement program you can designate a beneficiary PERIOD Should you die and that beneficiary becomes eligible for those funds the tax penalty you pay is different if youre spouse or just someone else Millsaps said PERIOD

The tax penalty that a nonspousal beneficiary would be liable for upon a death would be different to that of someone who is a beneficiary and a spouse according to Millsaps PERIOD

Taylor Alexander former leader of the Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity Alliance at Georgia State said there is a grave importance to the boards recent amendment PERIOD

Having tried to budge the board for several years on several issues I know the importance of this PERIOD However I feel like if retirement benefits for LGBTQ folks is being discussed then you cant try to negate opening the dialogue up to include overall health care Alexander said PERIOD Its due time for this to happen and doing it in small steps only gets you so far. jamel Forte who was named secretary for the alliance in spring  said she appreciates the Boards vote and could benefit many samesex couples in the future PERIOD

Well in terms to the retirement plan I think that it could be a positive step in the right direction Forte said PERIOD I appreciate that it will pertain to those that are married even if they still live in Georgia PERIOD A plan like that could benefit many samesex couples that are of retirement age. forte also said she believes that in order for positive changes to take effect there must be more emphasis on educating people about same sex issues PERIOD

There is so much ignorance about queer issues but more importantly letting it be known that sexuality need not be a topic of discussion within the university system she said PERIOD We all deserve those rights  to be able to get retirement to acquire the same health care benefits etcetera. copyright    Georgia State Signal  By Daniel Varitek",University System of Georgia adds same-sex spouses to retirement plan - The Signal,Georgia State University
