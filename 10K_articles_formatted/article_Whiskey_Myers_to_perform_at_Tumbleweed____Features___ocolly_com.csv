Blues southern groove straight from east Texas will meet hardrock jams of the 70s tonight when Whiskey Myers takes the stage at the Tumbleweed Dance Hall PERIOD

The reddirt Texas band began in a way that sounds similar to many college basement jam sessions PERIOD Lead vocalist Cody Cannon and guitarist John Jeffers were childhood friends who shared a passion for music PERIOD

After the addition of guitarist Cody Tate a move to Tyler Texas and the addition of drummer Jeff Hogg and his cousin bassist Gary Brown the band was complete PERIOD

However Brown didnt play bass until unlikely teachers recruited and educated him PERIOD

 Tate said PERIOD

After the five band members moved into a house together they began playing for their friends who strayed in and out. when the band gave its first official performance in Montalba Texas the members anxiously played through their set list PERIOD
