Will Carver Freshman Council secretary was selected to be the Student

Government Associations historian PERIOD

Carver will have a great deal of responsibility in this position but he

shouldnt have a problem based on his active progressive background

working with Freshman Council PERIOD

Carver will be responsible for making sure the new policies of one

administration are carried out in the next composing an SGA  Booklet in order to inform the UT community of SGA activities PERIOD He

will also compile the history of the SGA over the past  years PERIOD

The historian position is very important to the SGA because the association

has made changes and progressed in ways that affect student life at UT PERIOD

Without a historian paperwork  such as bills or policies  could be

lost PERIOD

Usually the SGA president and vice president are graduating seniors PERIOD Once

their terms are complete and they leave the university they might not be

available to help compile information for the next administration PERIOD With

Carver working as the SGA historian there should not be a need to contact

past SGA presidents and vice presidents PERIOD

Carvers experience in working with the Freshman Council a branch of the

SGA should help him in his new position PERIOD The branches are similar in that

they both deal with student concerns and pass bills to benefit the student

body PERIOD

His position as secretary will also help him in his new position because

his role as secretary is similar to a historian in the compilation and

categorization of information PERIOD

Hopefully through Carvers efforts in capturing SGAs achievements and

highlights in a booklet it will make more people appreciate the hard work

done by the members of the SGA PERIOD

With the addition of the historian position students will have the

opportunity to view the achievements of the SGA when they return to campus

for homecomings and reunions PERIOD
