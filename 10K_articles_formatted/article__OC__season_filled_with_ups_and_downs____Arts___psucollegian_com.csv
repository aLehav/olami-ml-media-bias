Last semester after I had previewed the first two episodes of The OC  I wrote that it appeared as though the excessive number of pulp culture references and overwhelming soapiness of the show had not disappeared in the second season PERIOD

I dont think Ive ever been more correct in my life PERIOD

After  episodes of dating drama and more dating The OC is now headed into the final stretch of what has been a tumultuous season to say the absolute least PERIOD The first of the final seven episodes of the season aired last night PERIOD

While this is not the midway point of the season by any means I felt as though it would be a good time to critique what weve seen so far and predict just what may happen to the Newport Beach crowd in the final segment of season two PERIOD

As I look back on what Ive seen so far with this season I must say that Ive been slightly disappointed PERIOD

What looked so promising early on in the year  new characters new conflicts and more adultparent read Sandy and Kirsten Cohen involvement  has now dissipated into what I feel is the same show week after week PERIOD Hardcore fans of the show may find that statement to be completely offbase but I consider myself an experienced viewer of this show and therefore believe I know what Im talking about PERIOD Lately I can feel my interest in the show slipping and I cant help but think that if the bland story lines and lack of character development continue by this time next year I may have a new thing to do Thursdays at  p.m PERIOD

In the interest of preserving the shows appeal to viewers around the country Im going to offer up suggestions to both the cast and creator Josh Schwartz PERIOD

First off if youre going to introduce prominent characters into the series fold dont let them disappear after  episodes PERIOD We saw this early on with the introduction of Seth Cohens Adam Brody new love Alex Olivia Wilde  who recently departed after a brief fling with Marissa Mischa Barton  and Ryans Benjamin McKenzie girlfriend that wasnt Lindsay Shannon Lucio who upon learning about her family history recently exited for Chicago PERIOD

It is a crime for Schwartz to set us up with all of these interesting personalities and then leave us with just the fab foursome Brody McKenzie Barton and Rachel Bilson Summer to follow PERIOD As of now those are the only characters left and it appears as if theyre all heading toward reunion that would put us in the same territory as last year and make for a pretty lame ending to a season filled with all kinds of drama PERIOD

Secondly keep giving Sandy Peter Gallagher and Kirsten Kelly Rowan those plum adult story lines but try to make them somewhat believable in the process PERIOD

This goes for both the writers and the actors involved PERIOD

While the two have both flirted with separation issues this entire season neither has had any kind of plausible reason for doing so PERIOD

Sandys dumb story arc involving an excollege lover Kim Delaney was neither as important or as sophisticated as viewers were led to believe and I was happy to see her recent exit PERIOD Kirstens new diversion in the office Billy Campbell looks like a promising development  lets hope that it is PERIOD

If I could leave one final suggestion for the creators of this once spectacular show it would be not to repeat themselves on a weekly basis PERIOD For a TV show that claims to be as hip and uptodate as nearly anything on the market it is doubly important to come up with original ideas for each new episode PERIOD Otherwise what were all going to be left with is just another sorry excuse for a teen drama PERIOD
