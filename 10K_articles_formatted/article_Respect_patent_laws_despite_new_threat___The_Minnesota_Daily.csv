A government urging citizens to continue with life normally must set a similar example PERIOD Instead the Canadian government is catering to mass hysteria and lawlessness and some in the United States propose following suit PERIOD

Canada sent shockwaves through the pharmaceutical industry Thursday when it overrode Bayer AGs patent on the anthrax vaccine Cipro claiming their milliontablet order of a generic form of Cipro could not be supplied by Bayer alone PERIOD New York Democrat Charles Schumer and others in Washington argue this concepts validity but civil liberties infringements and implications for future drug research make a strong case to the contrary PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD government condemns martial law as a reaction to the Sept PERIOD  attacks and has pushed citizens to resume their normal lives PERIOD Yet breaking the patent law flatly contradicts this PERIOD It confiscates Bayers property using the anthrax scare as an excuse to break laws PERIOD Part of the skyrocketing demand also comes from civilians who are not at risk for anthrax but stockpile Cipro anyway PERIOD Government patent removal would cater to the mass hysteria sweeping the country PERIOD

Breaking this law might also be unnecessary as Bayer claims it is capable of handling the demand PERIOD In fact last month the company tripled its Cipro shipments PERIOD Additionally federal guidelines now require only five days of Cipro   tablets in all  and followup treatment with other medication which is substantially less than the previous 120tablet dosage PERIOD There are also alternatives to quell the demand without undermining patents PERIOD Bayer can license other companies to produce the drug if need outstrips its production capabilities PERIOD

Challenging patents will also hinder research and development of biological warfare vaccines just as the need for such vaccines reaches its peak PERIOD Evidence of rogue nations altering biological agents to increase their resistance to existing vaccines makes further research pivotal PERIOD Removing the patent security from drug companies makes for a potentially catastrophic move PERIOD

Challenging patent sanctity was avoided even during the height of the AIDS crisis and the vast and continuing research and development in that field is evidence enough that patent removal is detrimental to the industry PERIOD Many argue that patents increase costs and make drugs less available but government deals usually demand lower than market prices anyway PERIOD

Implications of undermining patent law go beyond this one situation PERIOD Any future rights removal could be given the same legal justification for instance if removal of property becomes an accepted governmental action PERIOD If the United States does this other countries might follow its lead crippling drug companies PERIOD It is absolutely necessary that to maximize vaccine production efficiency the government cooperate with rather than battle pharmaceutical companies PERIOD
