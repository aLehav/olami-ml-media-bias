Gabrielle Ramos  leads students in learning the salsa PERIOD

Students were stepping dipping and turning throughout the David V PERIOD Wise Center PERIOD

On Feb PERIOD  the Spanish house hosted a salsa dancing event in the David V PERIOD Wise Center dance studio PERIOD Instructor Gabrielle Ramos  taught a room full of Allegheny students and community members the basics of the dance and difficult techniques PERIOD

Salsa revolves around the ideas of Cuban folk dancing and is a mixture of old dances and songs which originate from different parts of Cuba PERIOD There are multiple forms of salsa dancing each having developed in different parts of the world PERIOD Countries have different interpretations on classic rhythms and add their own special moves to it PERIOD In the United States the style of dance changes largely based on the coast because of concentrations of immigrant populations PERIOD

Within this course various moves taught were how to step dip and even turn PERIOD The participants were able to work with friends or meet someone new while there which meant some were able to make new friends and have a bonding experience with the ones they brought by being partners when practicing these said moves PERIOD

Students also learned a series of stretches they can do in their dorm rooms since stretching is key to not getting injured while dancing PERIOD Stretching is used to prepare one to move freely and reduce fear of injury PERIOD

The members of the Spanish house were enthusiastic for the event PERIOD Each month the Spanish house holds a different event spearheaded by a different house member PERIOD These events are typically open to the entire campus PERIOD While a majority of those in attendance are Spanish majors and minors the house members are hopeful that they can inspire more students to participate PERIOD

The Spanish house keeps the events informal in order to make them accessible to all PERIOD

Ian Manning  discussed how insightful a course like this was and hopes to attend more within the near future PERIOD

It seems like a really fun opportunity to learn about a different type of dancing than what is deemed as usual Manning said PERIOD I think I learned quite a bit too. the Spanish house event was both informative and entertaining for attendees PERIOD

I think its fun to dance with other people and the drop we learned was crazy said Yadira Sanchez  PERIOD

During this event people received the chance to learn up to three special moves including a drop which was seen as quite difficult PERIOD

I was dancing salsa some years ago but I had completely forgot how to so I was able to learn again said Celia Ibanez PERIOD Ibanez is the teaching assistant for the Spanish house PERIOD

The course was not geared towards a certain level of dancers PERIOD Both new and advanced salsa dancers were welcome PERIOD

A handful of the Spanish house members already knew the dance prior to the course but still attended to offer positive feedback to participants PERIOD

This event like other dance courses are hosted on weekends so that it is accessible for all students PERIOD The group hopes the number of participants and their enjoyment continues to increase as it always has PERIOD
