Some clouds PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm





Crowds gather outside Macys department store November   in New York in advance of the midnight November  opening to start the stores  shopping weekend PERIOD

Hurry up and clear your plates Thanksgiving dinner is over PERIOD Its time to trample a pregnant lady at Target to get that 72inch flat screen on mega sale PERIOD Does anyone else think Black Friday is the most awful greedy yet wholly American holiday in existence

Every year we let the department store overlords creep into the one day of the year dedicated to giving thanks  or stuffing ourselves to the gills I mean PERIOD Why even call it Black Friday when it really lasts  hours and starts before the turkey even goes into the oven Whats next Is JC Penny going to have a catered dinner for the eager beavers standing in line hours before the store opens

Ive partaken in the antiThanksgiving ritual but once PERIOD I had no fun whatsoever the deals werent all that impressive and I witnessed some of the most childish behavior Ive ever seen from adults in my life PERIOD Mothers whove neglected their children at home to save some cents on the kids Christmas gifts are letting expletives fly as they fight each other for the last Lego Star Wars set on the shelf PERIOD Only the best for their sweet babies after all PERIOD Dads at each others throats fighting against their bellies full of turkey and stuffing for a chance at that sexy new grill thats  percent off PERIOD And theyre not even gifting it  its all for their own kingofthegrill glory PERIOD These parents have no excuses for their barbarian childishness PERIOD

How did we let such greed infiltrate our one designated day for giving thanks Maybe it has something to do with the inherent corruption of the holiday  you know the Puritans killing the Native Americans and stealing their land and whatnot PERIOD Its a holiday centered around feeling thankful for land and resources that were never ours to take in the first place PERIOD Naturally we would allow our day of gluttony  one thinly veiled under the guise of thankfulness  to become completely overshadowed with materialism selfishness and greed PERIOD

Dont get me wrong I love a good flash sale and gorging myself until the pants come unbuttoned as much as the next schmuck PERIOD But each year I find it harder to celebrate thankfulness in a society where Instagram posts have replaced genuine gratefulness togetherness and intentional quality time PERIOD Its a box being checked on the way out the door to the sales PERIOD As quickly as the Thanksgiving spread gets devoured the spirit of true thanks is lost PERIOD

Most families spend the day stressing over the dryness of the turkey and the perfectness of the pies bickering about politics and clashing beliefs to savor a single minute of the day PERIOD So many people I know would prefer to never attend their familys Thanksgiving again because of it but they do to oblige their mothers anyway PERIOD Im sad at the reality of this American holiday and truthfully Im not optimistic that it will ever really be about gratefulness PERIOD

Not that it ever was PERIOD Black Friday is the antithesis of Thanksgiving and its coming for our souls PERIOD
