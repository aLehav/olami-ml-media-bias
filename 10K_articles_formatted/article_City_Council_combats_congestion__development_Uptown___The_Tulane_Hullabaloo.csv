Martha Sanchez Staff ReporterOctober  

After years of contentious debate between Uptown residents and property developers the New Orleans City Council instituted new barriers against doubles to dorms developments PERIOD

The new rule approved Oct PERIOD  imposes stricter regulations on developers PERIOD Any new or refurbished properties with more than four bedrooms will be required to have an offstreet parking spot for each of the bedrooms in the development PERIOD

The developments can have at most twoandahalf bathrooms PERIOD The rules also require parking spots be built of materials that can absorb rainwater PERIOD

Not all properties will be affected by the Councils decision PERIOD Affordable housing developments are not included and neither are properties in commercial areas or with homestead exemptions PERIOD

City Planners first reviewed the issue last year when residents complained about developers taking advantage of the neighborhood housing markets by renovating homes and renting them out to college students at a high cost PERIOD

We needed something to be done councilmember Joe Giarrusso said PERIOD

Tulane University students help drive this market PERIOD Juniors seniors and graduate students typically live off campus PERIOD

Neighbors mainly have issues with developers who buy homes traditionally used by renters or families then completely change their structures into multibedroom miniature dormitories PERIOD

Thats not what these neighborhoods are for Giarrusso said PERIOD

Such developments have three main consequences according to Giarrusso PERIOD Once converted homes cannot be used for other purposes PERIOD Rents go up as a result PERIOD If homes are purchased for more than market value taxes also rise forcing some residents to move away PERIOD

When you have universities that are right near residential areas its always going to be a delicate ecosystem Giarrusso said PERIOD

Multibedroom developments also create congestion because there are often not enough parking spaces for so many renters under one roof PERIOD

Peter Ricchiuti a Tulane business professor and 25year resident of the area said the doubles to dorms initiative has made parking increasingly difficult PERIOD

Anyone driving around this neighborhood will reach the same conclusion Ricchiuti said PERIOD

After months of studying the issue the City Planning Commission argued the parking rules would raise the cost of housing PERIOD Other detractors say the rules will discourage affordable housing at a time when access to it is a rising problem in urban neighborhoods PERIOD

State Representative Aimee Freeman a Tulane adjunct professor and graduate said she hopes the new ordinance will keep the neighborhood accessible to both students and longtime residents PERIOD

A critical piece of keeping our neighborhood livable and affordable is stopping over developments Freeman said PERIOD

Development barriers combined with Hurricane Ida repairs and supply chain delays could temporarily decrease available rentals in nearby neighborhoods PERIOD Students should understand this information when looking for offcampus housing said Lauren Jardell Tulane director of Local Government and Community Relations PERIOD

Giarrusso said he has not heard concerns from Tulane about housing availability PERIOD

The Council approved the motion unanimously PERIOD Members will later approve a formalized ordinance of the rules PERIOD

Your donation will support the student journalists of Tulane University PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
