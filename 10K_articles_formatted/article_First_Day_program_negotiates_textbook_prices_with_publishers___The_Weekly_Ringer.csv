The First Day Program adds an automatic charge to a students account for materials students can opt out of the program and be refunded PERIOD

NATHALIE LUCIANO

The First Day Inclusive Access program by Barnes  Noble College was implemented this semester to reduce the cost of textbooks and course materials for students PERIOD Before the semester begins professors can choose to opt their classes in or out of this program PERIOD If a professor opts in the program automatically bills their students accounts for the courserequired textbooks at a reduced cost PERIOD Students can choose to opt out of the automatic charges before their specified deadline PERIOD

According to the First Day FAQs provided by the University of Mary Washington Bookstore the costs of the books are reduced by negotiations with the publisher PERIOD Digitized versions of the materials are made available through Canvas to enrolled students by the first day of classes but students can choose to purchase physical looseleaf copies instead PERIOD If a student drops or withdraws from the class they will be refunded according to UMWs policies on refunds for tuition and fees PERIOD

Professor of economics Robert Rycroft made use of this new program for all of his classes this semester PERIOD He volunteered to participate in the program after receiving an email from the campus bookstore informing him of the new model PERIOD

Its a promising program and I hope we continue to use it going forward he said PERIOD

Rycroft likes that because of the program all of his students had their textbooks by the first day of class which has not been the case in previous semesters PERIOD

An automatic message was sent to students enrolled in participating classes informing them of their involvement in the program and the benefits PERIOD However some students were not aware of their enrollment in it and incurred unexpected charges to their accounts PERIOD Banner does not specify which courses are enrolled in the First Day program PERIOD

I dont think the plan is necessarily a bad one but there was such little transparency and forewarning about it that I could understand why students especially those with tight and regulated budgets would be upset or annoyed said Otto Perl a sophomore majoring in English with a concentration in creative writing PERIOD

Despite the option to opt out some students still worry about the program PERIOD

The idea that the autonomy of deciding where to spend my money is being taken away does not sit well with me said Bonnie Akkerman a senior double majoring in history and English PERIOD Thats like letting your server decide the tip amount and you must go along with whatever they demand PERIOD  I want the freedom to get my materials from the best priced vendors. for the past two years Akkerman has purchased most of her required texts from online sources that were able to offer her the best deal PERIOD

Perl hopes that the program is more transparent in the future PERIOD

Im fortunate enough to come from a comfortable position where it was no worry for me but I hope that the process is improved in the future so that others can receive a more accommodating and clear experience he said PERIOD",First Day program negotiates textbook prices with publishers â€“ The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
