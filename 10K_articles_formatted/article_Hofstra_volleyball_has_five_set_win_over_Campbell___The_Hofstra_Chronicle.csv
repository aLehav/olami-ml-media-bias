The Hofstra University volleyball team triumphed in a fiveset win to complete a weekend sweep over the Campbell University Fighting Camels on Sunday Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

This is our first fiveset win of the year said Hofstra head coach Emily Mansur PERIOD We are very excited about that because we are going to need that as we move on through the season PERIOD Its two comparable teams and Campbell definitely played their game today which was a little bit different than yesterday so its a nice win to have. the Pride entered the series on a downhill tread but picked themselves up with Yagmur Cinels teamleading  kills PERIOD Clara Bal and Izadora Stedile also came in clutch with  kills each PERIOD

For Cinel what a great weekend for her Mansur said PERIOD It was really really cool to see she started a little tough today but then she just moved up and played a really good game PERIOD And Stedile came into a really tough situation and helped change the momentum and carry us to this win. hofstra still stands atop the Coastal Athletic Association CAA at  but remains stagnant in conference play at  PERIOD

Hofstra and Campbell worked themselves into a fiveset game with the Pride taking the second and fourth sets  and  PERIOD At the same time the Camels stayed out in front with first and third set wins  and  PERIOD

The Pride got things going in the fifth set by attacking the court first from two errors made by Maddie Converse for Campbell  PERIOD The Camels answered with two kills by Gwen Molkow and Converse with an attack error on Stedile to climb up  PERIOD

Hofstra continued to trend upward and took the lead again  off a fierce Sarah Pierre kill PERIOD Things got interesting when each team encountered tense backandforth scoring until Hofstra scored two straight on an error and a Cinel kill making it a  game PERIOD Back and forth scoring continued again as they traded kill for kill with the crowd roaring on PERIOD Campbell tied the game at  off a defensive miscue from Stedile PERIOD

Both teams tied the fifth set  times for an only 15point match PERIOD

The two biggest stars of the day came in clutch with three straight kills two coming from Cinel and the other from Stedile to bring the beat down and win the set and match  over the Camels PERIOD

Hofstra has just four games remaining in the regular season and each weekend is as important as the last coming down the stretch PERIOD

Its crucial as there is nothing set yet Mansur said PERIOD So this is a great win and we celebrate today but at the start of next week we have a new opponent and a whole new focus because it is super important as to where the CAA standings are right now. hofstra will take a trip down to South Carolina as they go up against the College of Charleston Cougars in a weekend series on Saturday Nov PERIOD  and Sunday Nov PERIOD  PERIOD The first game is at  p.m PERIOD and the second game is at  p.m PERIOD
