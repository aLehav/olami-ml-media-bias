Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



A Purdue tight end has always been familiar with the word potential. athletic tall and coming from one of the best high school football teams in Florida Gabe Holmes knew expectations would be high when he arrived in West Lafayette as a freshman PERIOD

But Holmes hasnt been able to turn in a breakout season like fans and coaches have been waiting for PERIOD

What Ive told him is we need to quit talking about it PERIOD Hes got a year left and hes got to go tight ends coach Gerad Parker said PERIOD I coached a guy with a very similar personality to him when I was at Marshall and he ended up being that productive guy PERIOD The biggest thing is to just expect greatness out of him every practice everything he does PERIOD Great plays are made all the time and he needs to go make them if he wants to be special. holmes enters his senior year as the undisputed leader among the tight ends PERIOD Gone is former walkon and captain Crosby Wright who led the tight ends in receiving in the  season with  yards PERIOD

Holmes has battled minor injuries throughout his Purdue career and recorded  yards and two touchdowns on  receptions last season PERIOD The  Florida native has  yards on  receptions in his three years as a Boilermaker PERIOD

Obviously Gabe has a chance everyone tells you and I continue to tell him Parker said PERIOD We have to get him to that point where hes a guy in this league that can be a first team allconference guy and help us and the offense go. holmes may benefit in his final season from the coaching change and new offensive style offensive coordinator John Shoop brings PERIOD Throughout spring practice the offense has ran many formations using multiple tight ends something Danny Hopes spread offense didnt implement much PERIOD

We are doing a lot of movement Holmes said PERIOD Coach Shoop likes that YY set its two tight ends in the game PERIOD If we can get good at that we might have three or even four tight ends in the game PERIOD Our job is to get as many tight ends in the game as possible. as a senior Holmes must face the expectations of leading a young group of tight ends who will be looking up to him for guidance PERIOD Holmes said maintaining positive body language will be needed to show the other tight ends how to react to adversity PERIOD

Im an older guy so I understand the younger guys look up to me and its my job to be in tune Holmes said PERIOD If I make a bad play I cant show it on my face or my body language because someone else is looking at you PERIOD You have to jog it back in grit your teeth and get back into it. log In
