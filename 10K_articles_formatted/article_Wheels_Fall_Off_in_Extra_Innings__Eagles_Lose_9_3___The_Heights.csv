3705,2021-03-29,"boston College baseball came into its weekend series against Clemson with one of the most prolific offenses in the country and the pattern continued with doubledigit scoring on Friday night PERIOD But the tide changed on Saturday as both teams needed length out of their starting pitchers and they got it PERIOD Both starters went for . innings and the bullpen was solid for both teams as well making for a defensive battle PERIOD

The Eagles   Atlantic Coast fought hard with the Tigers   all game clawing back from a  deficit in the top of the seventh inning to send the contest to extra innings PERIOD It was then that BC fell apart and Clemson exploded in the tenth inning for six hits and six runs downing the Eagles  PERIOD

Most of the game was a thriller between the fastballthrowing lefty Keyshawn Askew and righthanded offspeed specialist Emmet Sheehan PERIOD Askew came into Saturdays game rolling for Clemson with only a . eRA on the season PERIOD Although Sheehan has had some ups and downs with a . eRA this season his last outing against UNC was promising and he kept up the progress on Saturday PERIOD

Although he hit the first batter of the game Sheehan settled down and only gave up one hit through the first three innings PERIOD He worked his way around the strike zone by using the changeup to keep Clemson batters on their heels PERIOD

During the fourth inning Clemsons James Parker finally ended the scoreless start to the game with a solo shot that stayed just inside the leftfield pole PERIOD His run seemed to shake Sheehan who ended up hitting his next batter and giving up an infield single PERIOD With runners on first and second and only one out it looked like the Tigers were going to pull away PERIOD

But Sheehan got the next batter to fly out and worked back from a  count to strike out the final batter and end the inning PERIOD

Although the two hottest hitters for the Eagles right now sophomores Vince Cimini and Luke Gold challenged Askew with two singles in the fourth he got out of the inning clean once again PERIOD

At the beginning of the fifth inning the Tigers continued to put pressure on BCs defense PERIOD Elijah Henderson hit a rocket down the leftfield line for his second double of the game PERIOD Clemson advanced him to third with a sacrifice bunt and Parker stepped up to the plate in a big spot PERIOD Sheehan let a few pitches get away from him walking Parker and allowing Henderson to score on a passed ball to make the score  PERIOD

But Sheehan showed his toughness again working out of the jam by using some high heat to strike out the next Clemson batter PERIOD

During the bottom of the fifth the Eagles finally cracked Askew PERIOD Peter Burns started with a rocket up the middle and Chris Galland and Sal Frelick followed Burns to load the bases up PERIOD With the table set Cody Morissette earned the Eagles their first run on a fielders choice to bring the score to  PERIOD

After a pitching battle in the sixth Sheehan gave up his third and final run of the game when Parker hit a single up the middle PERIOD BC head coach Mike Gambino made his first call to the bullpen ending the day for Sheehan who finished with seven strikeouts and only three earned runs PERIOD

Sophomore righthander Max Gieg came in for the Eagles helping them come back from a  deficit PERIOD Although he looked shaky at first Gieg settled in to get out of the twoout jam PERIOD

Askews day came to an end in the seventh after Galland once again got into scoring position and was sent home by Frelick to make the game  PERIOD Askew posted a good outing with eight strikeouts and only two earned runs PERIOD He was replaced by lefty Geoffrey Gilbert who gave up a hit initially but also ended up finishing the inning without giving up a run PERIOD

After a walk by Gieg to start the eighth Gambino made a surprising move turning to his freshman in the bullpen PERIOD He started with lefty sensation Charlie Coon who dominated the eighth and ninth innings making the Clemson batters look uncomfortable at the plate PERIOD He ended up tallying six strikeouts and zero runs on only seven batters PERIOD

Unfortunately for the Tigers the same could not be said for what is typically a very good bullpen PERIOD In the bottom of the eighth Cimini hit another single in a 3for5 day at the plate PERIOD From there freshman pinch hitter Travis Honeyman delivered in a crucial situation to get Cimini home on a sac fly tying the game at three apiece PERIOD

Clemson coach Monte Lee went to his top reliever Nick Clayton who turned things around PERIOD

After both teams were shut out in the ninth Clemson finally cracked Coon getting runners on first and second with no outs in the top of the tenth PERIOD Gambino turned to another freshman righthander Joey Ryan to get the Eagles out of another jam PERIOD Unfortunately for Ryan the Clemson bats finally capitalized with two doubles and two singles to bring home six runs PERIOD
