2881,2005-03-09,"eight students at California State University at Chico were charged March  with various crimes after a student was killed during a fraternitys Hell Week. according to Chico State Director of Public Affairs Joe Wills junior Matthew Carrington died Feb PERIOD  at Enloe Medical Center PERIOD Unlike most hazing fatalities Carrington was not killed by alcohol poisoning PERIOD

Rather Carrington was taken into the basement of the fraternity Chi Tau where he was ordered to do calisthenics on one foot while other members repeatedly dumped gallons of water on him and large fans blew air PERIOD Windows in the basement were also left open to make the temperature colder PERIOD Additionally Carrington was asked to drink from a fivegallon jug when he incorrectly answered various trivia questions members gave him PERIOD

According to the San Francisco Chronicle Carrington collapsed midway through a pushup and died two hours later as both hypothermia and water intoxication took hold PERIOD

The incident was not Chi Taus first act of misconduct PERIOD According to Wills Chi Tau was a rogue fraternity and had not been recognized by Chico State since  when the university refused to recognize the fraternity any longer PERIOD

At the time Chi Tau was Delta Sigma Phi and had been accused of assaults fighting noise complaints alcohol violations and police calls to the fraternity PERIOD

Additionally Delta Sigma Phi stripped the group of its localchapter status PERIOD As a result the fraternity took the name Chi Tau a former name for Delta Sigma Phi PERIOD

Their neighbors in downtown Chico were very disheartened to see the way this group was operating Wills said PERIOD People were disgusted. butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey filed four acts of involuntary manslaughter and four acts of hazing PERIOD Three of the four students charged with involuntary manslaughter were not Chico State students and three of the four students charged with hazing were Chico State students PERIOD

Ramsey whose best friend was killed in a highschool hazing incident said he took the case personally PERIOD

No one obviously intended this to happen Ramsey said PERIOD But this was a stupid and criminal act PERIOD People need to bear the responsibility for this death. however some believe it was not all too unreasonable to see why Carrington went through with the hazing PERIOD

University of Wisconsin professor of human development Brad Brown said people vary in the extent of how grouporiented they are and how varied they are in their tolerance for pain PERIOD

There is a natural inclination of human beings to associate with other human beings Brown said PERIOD Theres also a natural inclination to survive PERIOD At some point individuals are loathed to go through rituals that dont show good costbenefit analysis. fortunately the University of WisconsinMadison is not as vulnerable to such groups PERIOD

Ed Mirecki UW fraternity and sorority advisor said Madison has policies intended to prevent incidents like those at Chico State from happening PERIOD

However the concept of underground fraternities is not new PERIOD

Theyre not official and they continue to exist Mirecki said PERIOD Additionally UW has never experienced a situation like that present at Chico State PERIOD

Its amazing that could happen on any college campus Mirecki said PERIOD
