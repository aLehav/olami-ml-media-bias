5123,2023-11-04,"the Minnesota Daily begins with sailing as part of a weekly look at club sports PERIOD

Why would a large group of University students be sitting next to Lake Minnetonka this weekend complaining about the nearperfect weather

The answer is all too simple for the Minnesota club sailing team PERIOD

A necessity for sailing is wind and this weekend there was barely enough to go around as the team hosted the Gopher Invite PERIOD

After being delayed for close to three hours Saturday due to the lack of wind and the ice that had formed on the calm water during the night  sailing boats hit the water to compete in a series of races over the next two days PERIOD

And according to junior Jessica Haverstock the results were worth the wait as Minnesota won both the A and B fleets at the event PERIOD

This weekends results are tallied by combining the times of two fleets from each school PERIOD

The A fleet and the B fleet each sail a designed course in this case a line of three buoys called an Olympic course PERIOD

The crews line up along the center buoy  or the jibe mark  and head first for the windward mark which is upwind of the starting point PERIOD

Once each boat reaches the windward mark the crew must turn the boat around the buoy and sail back past where they began toward the downwind leeward mark PERIOD

The homestretch of the race comes once the boat sails around the buoy and heads back toward the jibe mark in the center to finish the race PERIOD

The use of two fleets helps to test a programs depth according to Minnesota junior commodore Dave Elsmo PERIOD

Elsmo is one of the teams more experienced sailors hes been sailing practically his entire life PERIOD

Its one reason he was named commodore the equivalent of a captain in other activities PERIOD

But experience isnt something students need in order to sail with the team PERIOD

According to Elsmo some members of the club have relatively little experience or none at all PERIOD

One problem Elsmo said the team often faces is that people dont even know the sailing club exists which has led the team to use unusual means to attempt to recruit PERIOD

On Friday we took one of our boats out in front of Coffman Union Elsmo said PERIOD Mostly our recruiting is by word of mouth so what we did Friday was pretty huge for the team. for example freshman Amberose Kramer said she learned about the team when she ran into Elsmo who she met growing up in Racine Wis. on the first day of class last fall PERIOD

According to Elsmo the  sailors that make up the Minnesota team pale in comparison to larger programs in the Midwest Collegiate Sailing Association like Wisconsins PERIOD

As a club sport the sailing team also must deal with a small budget which Elsmo said is quite difficult considering sailing is by no means an inexpensive activity PERIOD

Elsmo said the last time the club was awarded a University allocation it received  but most years the team spends close to  a year on boats travel coaching etc. making it difficult to compete with established programs PERIOD

Varsity sailing is mostly the coastal schools and they have million dollar budgets  they dont even have to actively recruit because theyre just a name Elsmo said PERIOD Theyre like How much is your budget and our entire budget is equal to theirs for that regatta. one thing Minnesota has that other MCSA programs dont is a regular coach in Cappy Capper PERIOD

Cappys great  hes got a lot of experience and he grew up sailing Haverstock said PERIOD He really knows what hes talking about and hes good for advice on and off the water. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
