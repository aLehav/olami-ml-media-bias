Before Amanda Barnett left home for her freshman year at San Jose State University hardly a Before Amanda Barnett left home for her freshman year at San Jose State University hardly a week passed by that she didnt receive a bundle of ads or emails hawking cool stuff to buy for school PERIOD

She used the information like a general plotting a campaign PERIOD She scoured the Internet for decorating ideas and hunted for bargains to transform her 12by15foot dorm room from dreary box to striking personal statement PERIOD

She descended on WalMart for seethrough underbed storage containers PERIOD She snapped up college discounts at Bed Bath  Beyond for pink and red towels and extralong twin sheets plus a pink bathroom tote spacesaving shoe bag and a thick black bedspread with lots of soft red pillows PERIOD She and her roommate picked out a bright patchwork rug at Target PERIOD

Add in a laptop an MP3 player cell phone posters and dozens of photographs and youve got some of the bare essentials that todays designconscious college students are packing into their dorm rooms PERIOD Some look more like tiny first apartments than the spare sparsely furnished cubicles of yore PERIOD

Our generation has always gotten a lot of advertising for toys and stuff we grew up with it and now weve moved to college said Tera Nakata a junior at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley PERIOD And our generation of parents didnt experience economic hardship in the same way their parents did. the array of stylish merchandise at discount prices is making it more normal to get things for college Nakata said PERIOD You think This isnt so expensive so Ill go out and get it instead of bringing it from home. thats exactly what retailers are counting on PERIOD Marketers are increasingly targeting this historically neglected group in print ads and catalogs on television and radio and via the mailbox and Internet PERIOD This summer Target pursued the college market with its Do Your Room campaign PERIOD Linens n Things touted Destination Dorm. the Container Store offered students special afterhours discount shopping PERIOD And Bed Bath  Beyond promoted an online college registry. walMart offered Campus Cool shopping online PERIOD

All are scrambling for a piece of the . billion that students and their families are expected to spend on backtocollege merchandise this year nearly twice the amount expected for elementary and high school students according to a National Retail Federation survey PERIOD

The retailers have definitely zeroed in on college students as a target market said Victor Culatta associate director of residential living at UCBerkeley PERIOD They are designing and tailoring their product lines to meet their needs. students are bringing more personal belongings to college than they did a decade ago said Imogen Hinds manager of undergraduate housing at Stanford University PERIOD

They equip their dorm rooms with microwave ovens minifridges microfridges televisions and computers  enough electrical devices to cause worries about power problems in older halls PERIOD

They have more electronic gadgets and gizmos than Ive ever seen said UCBerkeleys Culatta PERIOD Our students are very technosavvy and I think their belongings reflect a level of sophistication and expertise. many have a budding sense of personal style honed by TV design shows such as MTV Cribs and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. at Stanford for example more students are bringing their own futons and seating such as colorful bean bag or inflatable chairs or ergonomic desk chairs even though residence halls are furnished PERIOD

We do have students completely disassemble their beds put them on the side of the room and sleep on a futon or the floor Hinds said noting that schoolsupplied dorm furniture is not supposed to leave the room PERIOD They like a lot of design options to move things around PERIOD And students like to bring in personal color. for a young person away from home for the first time its a chance to invent yourself through the things you own said Nakata who likes to express her individuality by making things for her Berkeley room such as pencil holders and pillows PERIOD

Thinking about how to decorate has been an exciting part of going away to college for Kirnan Klein who heads to UCSanta Barbara in about two weeks PERIOD

I feel like I can control it all Klein said PERIOD Unlike her room at home which has stayed much the same over the years at college I can decorate it however I want. while Klein has been scouting decorating ideas for the past year her boyfriend Dan Feldman said he hasnt put much thought into his freshman dorm room at the University of Oregon PERIOD He was more concerned about electronic essentials a computer MP3 player digital camera and maybe a video game console if his roommate brings a TV PERIOD

These are really tiny rooms  like a hotel room and there are two people in it Feldman said PERIOD The stuff they sell a lot of times is handy but a lot of times its excessive PERIOD You really have to control your imagination and look at reality and say I really dont have room. v
