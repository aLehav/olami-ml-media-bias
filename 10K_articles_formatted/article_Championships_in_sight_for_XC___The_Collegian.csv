4068,2023-11-03,"with the season winding down and only one more meet before the Western Athletic Conference WAC Championships cross country coach Joe Gonzales is looking for a strong finish from his mens and womens teams PERIOD

The Bulldogs had a good showing recently with both teams placing third at the Triton Classic in San Diego PERIOD

Freshman Erick Garcia contributed with a second place finish in the mens 10K while junior Roxanne Sellick finished fifth in the womens 6K PERIOD

Gonzales sees injuries and health issues as the only setbacks that could affect both teams possibilities of finishing well PERIOD

The biggest obstacle is keeping them healthy Gonzales said PERIOD Hopefully they dont have a friend that has a cold that sneezes on them. with the miles winding down he does not see injuries as a threat PERIOD

Although cross country does not have standings or rankings to measure the competition Gonzales believes his teams will do well at the WAC championships PERIOD

The ladies are really strong with the guys it is hard to tell PERIOD We have a good chance of being in the top three Gonzales said PERIOD There are seven mens teams and nine womens teams PERIOD Our goal is to finish in the top  percent on each side. gonzales sees the Bulldogs going beyond the WAC championships as well PERIOD

If everything goes like it should I think both teams will make the regionals Gonzales said PERIOD Erick has a great shot at making nationals. gonzales says that this seasons team has been one of the most enjoyable and fun groups he has ever worked with PERIOD

Using the adjectives goaloriented and dedicated he does not worry about motivation as a factor to consider for postseason success with his team PERIOD

I do not have to worry about pumping them up Gonzales said PERIOD They know what it takes. your donation will support the student journalists of Fresno State Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
