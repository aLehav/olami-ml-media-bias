I have officially lost count of how many times I have been asked those series of quick questions during my three years at Quinnipiac PERIOD And I dont blame people for asking either PERIOD

When taking a step back it definitely sounds kind of strange for a 17yearold to pack up and leave Los Angeles to experience  what is supposed to be the prime years of young adulthood  four years of college in Hamden Connecticut PERIOD

I get that but I can explain once and for all PERIOD Lets start from the top PERIOD

Im from the West Coast but my Dad a good Canadian boy brainwashed me into loving hockey PERIOD I had a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey ready for me when I came out of the womb whaddup Mom PERIOD

I played youth hockey throughout my childhood and teenage years but as soon as I realized I couldnt play professionally  this revelation came at a sprite  years old  I wanted to become part of the sports media world PERIOD

At  years old I was starting to narrow down where I wanted to pursue sports journalism and came across a college hockey team with bright yellow jerseys and a wild name playing on ESPN in the  Frozen Four PERIOD That planted the seed PERIOD

A few months later my high schools college guidance counselor gave me a list of recommended schools to apply to PERIOD I spotted that weirdlooking name and it intrigued me PERIOD

An opportunity to move across the country live on the East Coast have two of the largest sports media corporations instate and maybe just maybe I could work my way up within student media to cover the powerhouse of a mens ice hockey team PERIOD

It took a couple of college tours and some courage to leave home but by the middle of my senior year of high school I was all in on Quinnipiac PERIOD

In Hamden I didnt go to my freshman year involvement fair PERIOD I heard about different student media organizations from a few orientation leaders but it was flatout intimidating PERIOD

As a quiet and nervous aspiring print sports journalist I didnt know how to separate myself from the pack within the heavy sportsoriented organization like QBSN or Q30 Sports PERIOD In order to get involved at all it took a friend to drag me into The Chronicle meeting in midOctober PERIOD By the end of the meeting I was assigned to cover a game of womens rugby over the weekend PERIOD

That was the start PERIOD

With each piece I wrote and graphic I created I gained confidence in my abilities PERIOD Even if it was through The Chronicle which was and might still be frankly the atypical sports group within student media I wasnt just doing I was learning PERIOD

Through The Chronicle I received an unbelievable foundation which I could build upon PERIOD I was able to get the handson experience necessary to improve in the field but also received repetitive criticism that helped me grow into a real and ethical journalist PERIOD

The foundation of AP Style in writing and proper use of images within creating graphics became second nature to me by the end of my freshman year PERIOD I was able to consciously create without the pressure of not knowing how to do it correctly PERIOD

By my sophomore year I accomplished my college goal of becoming a Quinnipiac mens ice hockey beat writer and simultaneously became the one throwing out ideas at weekly staff meetings rather than being assigned PERIOD

Without even knowing it at the time The Chronicle molded me into a more professional writer provided connections through experience and forced me to break out of my shell PERIOD

At this time last year I became the Sports Editor of The Chronicle and if you asked freshman Justin it was a role I never saw myself taking on especially in that short amount of time PERIOD I never thought Id be wellversed enough in newspaper jargon personable enough to delegate work to staff writers or let alone have any kind of influential say in this organization PERIOD

My comfort zone no longer existed and that carried over into becoming the Web Director of the newspaper in the middle of this year PERIOD

OK if youve made it this far shouts to you PERIOD Here is the point to all of this background information PERIOD

I was just a communications major with a desire to do something big but never had the courage to actually go out there and do it PERIOD Joining a relatively lowkey sports organization within student media like The Chronicle wasnt my ideal plan PERIOD

As an underclassman it was tough to be the only reporter representing a student media organization when the more prominent sports organizations had two three and sometimes six or seven kids covering a game PERIOD

The benefit I didnt know I had at the time was that others were doing the same things I was just with a more defined label attached to them PERIOD The ability to stick with a more esoteric group provided me with more opportunities PERIOD

And this isnt a knock on any of the other student media organizations at Quinnipiac we all work hard and do what we can to succeed in our own ways PERIOD

I just wouldnt trade my decision of breaking the norm by coming to the ohso foreign land of Connecticut working for a comparatively smaller student media organization and accomplishing more than I could have imagined in my three years for virtually anything PERIOD

The Chronicle sent me down an unbelievable path PERIOD Now its time to utilize everything I learned and continue to go against the grain in my next phase of sports media PERIOD
