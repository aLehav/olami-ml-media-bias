7641,1970-01-01,"by the time they play their first home game on Nov PERIOD  the Oregon club hockey players will have traveled nearly  miles and spent  hours in transit PERIOD

But its not as bad as it seems according to head coach Eddie LeRoy PERIOD Because the Ducks will have so much experience by the time they play their first home game there will be less pressure on the team he said PERIOD

Club coordinator Kevin Trihey said early road games might be something of a blessing in disguise PERIOD Trihey said he enjoys road trips and thinks the travel is important for team bonding PERIOD Because of the highoctane brand of hockey he expects the Ducks to play this year travel shouldnt hold the team back too much he said PERIOD

A lot of times the first game off the bus or off the vans is a little bit sluggish Trihey said PERIOD But I dont think energy will be a problem because we have a lot of fun no matter where we go and no matter who we play. overall the Ducks will play only eight home games this season largely because the team had such a light travel schedule last year PERIOD

You kind of have to repay the favor LeRoy said PERIOD

The Ducks games in Eugene in  may also be their final eight home contests at the Lane County Ice Center PERIOD The building is in disrepair and costs Lane County a significant amount of money to operate PERIOD LeRoy said the county is requiring a hefty . million  by March  to keep the ice center open next year PERIOD

LeRoy also stated that the private sector raised  just to keep the arena also home to the Eugene Generals minorleague hockey team open for this year PERIOD

If the private sector is unable to raise the money LeRoy fears that without a training facility in Eugene or a site for home games  may be the final chapter for Oregon hockey PERIOD

Im hoping that theres some big money in town that may be able to build another facility LeRoy said PERIOD But Im worried that this could be the last year for the Ducks. this is LeRoys first season as the head coach of the Ducks but its not his inaugural year behind the bench PERIOD From  he was an assistant to coach Scott McCallum who took the Ducks to the American Collegiate Hockey Association regionals twice PERIOD

A return to the postseason is a goal for the Ducks this year but after a disappointing thirdplace finish in the Pac8 last year Coach LeRoy said that priority number one for the Ducks is a Pac8 title PERIOD

Were just going to look for success this year PERIOD Whats happened in the past is in the past LeRoy said PERIOD

On the ice LeRoy is very optimistic for the Ducks chances this year PERIOD An intense week of tryouts gave him a good idea of what to expect in  PERIOD

I think weve made great strides LeRoy said Sunday after the teams alumni scrimmage PERIOD Its often hard to tell with tryouts  youre mixing up lines youre mixing up players but when you get out and you actually play a game and you have the lines that you want together then you can actually see how theyre playing and I like what I see. trihey is also optimistic about the Ducks onice talent this year PERIOD He said that the Ducks have an encouraging amount of returning talent as well as a promising crop of young players PERIOD

The Ducks open the season on Friday with the first of a threegame set against Washington State PERIOD The Cougars have given up an average of seven goals per game in  in losses to Washington and USC PERIOD
