Todays college students are seeing textbook prices at an alltime high according to a report by the American Enterprise Institute which found that textbook prices have increased by  percent since   a rate of increase that outpaces that of college tuition and inflation PERIOD

The increase in textbook prices translates into financial hardships for UNA students as textbook shopping becomes a greater burden PERIOD

Brad Nichols 20year manager of the 35yearold Off Campus Bookstore confirmed the trend PERIOD

My personal feeling is that the publisher just wants to make more money he said PERIOD

Nichols said his goal is to provide students the best possible price on books PERIOD The books in his store are bought directly from the publisher he said and his prices are about  to  percent of the publishers price PERIOD

Griffin Hite UNA Campus Bookstore manager said pricing in his store is straightforward PERIOD

Basically it boils down to the initial cost from the publisher plus an agreedupon contractual margin between the school and bookstore operator in this case Follett Higher Education Group Hite said via email PERIOD

Hite did not disclose the amount agreed upon in UNAs contract with Follett PERIOD

Hite said students can save by renting books or purchasing used books PERIOD

For Sherry Wilkes a UNA student and a single mother savings are not coming so easily PERIOD She decided to return to school last fall to find that the price of textbooks had more than doubled since earning her associate degree in  PERIOD

Then I paid for four classes and it cost maybe  she said while browsing the UNA Campus Bookstore PERIOD Here it is now and Id say Im looking at at least  this semester PERIOD

Just this book alone is  Wilkes said gesturing to a book required for one of her classes PERIOD I have no choice but to buy it PERIOD Its crazy especially for us single parents. john Barrett department chair of economics and finance at UNA said the rising cost of textbooks is an issue that both faculty and publishers are attempting to address PERIOD

You wouldnt believe how many publishers have asked us for ideas about what to do he said PERIOD If you look at the raw materials necessary to print a textbook its inexpensive PERIOD Its the compensation of the authors and other contributors that drives up the cost. barrett said inclusion of online resources such as CDs and access codes is another factor that drives up the cost of textbooks PERIOD

Despite the present circumstances Barrett has hope for the future PERIOD

I think the cost will stabilize at some point in the long run maybe even eventually come down he said PERIOD
