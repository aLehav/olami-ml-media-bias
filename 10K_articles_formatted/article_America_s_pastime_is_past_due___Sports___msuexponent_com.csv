Updated November     pm



Rob Manfred the commissioner of Major League Baseball stood in front of the press on Wednesday March  to announce the cancellation of the first two series of the baseball season PERIOD This did not come as a surprise the MLB has been on a lockout for over three months and will continue to be lockedout until a deal is made between the Major League Baseball Players Association MLBPA and the league owners PERIOD

The MLBPA is the trade union representing all players in the league PERIOD The union also represents coaches managers and athletic trainers who have a contract with the MLB PERIOD The league owners and the MLBPA have disagreed on numerous topics and a lockout ensued when a Collective Bargaining Agreement wasnt agreed upon by the Dec PERIOD  deadline PERIOD

The main reasoning behind the two sides disagreement is what sets baseball apart from other American professional sports the lack of a salary cap PERIOD The MLB is essentially a free market meaning each team can spend as much money as they feel necessary to build their team PERIOD However when teams exceed a certain payroll limit 2021s was  Million they are taxed heavily on it PERIOD This luxury tax also known as competitive balance tax is the primary topic the owners and MLBPA are fighting over PERIOD The union wants to increase the current threshold of  million to  million with it increasing sequentially to  million by  PERIOD

Even with this decision yet to be solved the groups are also in a debate over salary minimums and the format of the postseason PERIOD Minor League players received pay bumps last year of around  weekly depending on which class they play in according toSports Illustrated PERIOD This raise barely addresses the fundamental issue that most minor league players still live below the poverty line and often work a second or third job to make a living PERIOD

Players have not been shy voicing their opinions PERIOD Marco Gonzales a pitcher for the Seattle Mariners tweeted I wish the people who run this game loved it as much as the players and fans do. players arent the only ones in an uproar about the MLB Lockout PERIOD One of the busiest and most exciting parts of the season is Opening Day and fans travel from all around the country to watch their favorite teams kick off the season PERIOD Its disappointing for fans and especially for kids who have been looking forward to watching the stars they look up to Blake Dragan vice president of MSUs club baseball team said PERIOD

The negotiations have surfaced some interesting proposals for upcoming seasons PERIOD While many topics have been heavily debated the union granted the league the ability to implement three new changes PERIOD The given changes can be implemented as early as  and include adding a pitch clock banning the defensive shift and increasing the size of bases PERIOD The pitch clock has already been in use in college and semiprofessional baseball  it was designed to decrease time in between pitches and the game as a whole PERIOD The MLB is always looking to make the game more exciting to fans and the application of wider bases and banning shifts is an effort to increase the number of hits and action seen in games PERIOD

With the MLB lockout already postponing four regularseason series and a large portion of spring training players and fans arent the only ones who are impacted PERIOD Many people rely on spring training and regularseason games to bring in money so cutting games means many people will miss paychecks PERIOD The MLBPA created a  Million fund for workers who were impacted by this matter which will be distributed to stadium staff and concession crews as well as a  fund for nonprofits who are impacted by the ownerinitiated lockout PERIOD MLB is also creating a  million fund for spring training ballpark workers PERIOD As of now it is still unclear when each party will come to an agreement and the lockout will be lifted PERIOD

Manfred and the MLB announced the season will be pushed again back with another week of games being canceled on Wednesday March  PERIOD As of press time Opening Day for the  season is tentatively scheduled for April  PERIOD
