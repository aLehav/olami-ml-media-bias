8313,2023-10-25,"by all accounts Glorious is a comedy PERIOD

Its a comedy in which characters will exclaim Oh in synchronized fashion PERIOD Its a comedy in which an entire scene is played out while the audience is led to believe that they know what the scene is about however they dont PERIOD Its a comedy with language miscommunication hilarity and gay jokes abound PERIOD

But at the heart of Glorious playing at Theater Three through Dec PERIOD  is a tender ode to a woman who believed she could sing but could not PERIOD

Glorious is the true story of Florence Foster Jenkins whose inheritance lack of family responsibilities and surrounding set of supportive friends including her wandering but loyal boyfriend St PERIOD Clair her saucy girl friend Dorothy and her devoted pianist Cosm McMoon allowed her to tour with her special brand of singing style PERIOD

You could compare her to William Hung that American Idol reject whose offkey take on She Bangs made him something of a onehit wonder but to do so would be a disservice to Jenkins PERIOD

Audiences laughed but were also enamored with Jenkins enthusiasm and obvious love for singing PERIOD

In fact Jenkins is the predecessor for blissful obliviousness such as the Star Wars Kid whose light saber twirling video gave him unwanted attention PERIOD

Glorious begins with McMoons initial meeting with Jenkins and ends with her soldout final performance at the prestigious Carnegie Hall PERIOD The anticipation lies in waiting for Jenkins to start singing PERIOD

How bad can it really be A bit disappointedly Connie Coit showcases a wonderful singing voice PERIOD Her approach to Jenkins voice is to throw off her pitch PERIOD In recordings the real Jenkins had no singing voice whatsoever PERIOD

But no matter PERIOD The joy of Theater Threes Glorious is in watching Coits performance PERIOD Her voice may be off but her triumphant facial expressions and confident mannerisms while singing awfully are excellent PERIOD Make sure you buy a seat accordingly in the black box PERIOD  Hearing her voice is one thing but seeing that voice come out of her mouth fuels the whole experience PERIOD

Terry Dobson has delightfully sly moments as McMoon PERIOD As hes confronted with Jenkinss eccentric world the pianist cannot help but utter barbs PERIOD  After hearing Jenkinss voice for the first time hes naturally at a loss for words PERIOD

Bruce Elliott and Sally Cole look like theyre having a blast playing St PERIOD Clair and Dorothy respectively PERIOD Cecilia Flores is very fun as Jenkinss maid Maria who only speaks Spanish PERIOD

The set design by director Jac Alder and Barbara Murrell and costumes by Michael Robinson perfectly captures the 1940s PERIOD  Robinsons costumes for Jenkins are a riot PERIOD

The pacing of Glorious is off PERIOD  Some scenes within scenes are rushed without the necessary buildup and payoff while others are given laborious attention PERIOD

Playwright Peter Quilter writes a long monologue at the end that gives the play a forced melodramatic feel PERIOD  Most of the oneliners have wittier reincarnations elsewhere PERIOD

Ironically for an essentially onewoman show Glorious needs more of the woman PERIOD

But what is seen of the woman is indeed  glorious PERIOD
