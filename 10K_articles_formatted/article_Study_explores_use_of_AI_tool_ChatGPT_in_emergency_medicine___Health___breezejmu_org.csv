AI tool ChatGPT is as good as a doctor and sometimes better at diagnosing conditions in a hospital emergency department a new study shows PERIOD

The chatbot performed as well as a trained doctor in suggesting likely diagnoses for patients being assessed according to the pilot study PERIOD

Doctors had the correct diagnosis in their top five possibles  percent of the time with one version of ChatGPT scoring the same and another scoring  percent PERIOD

The researchers believe that with some more work done on it the technology could one day support doctors and cut waiting times in busy emergency departments PERIOD

The study presented at the European Emergency Medicine Congress was carried out at Jeroen Bosch Hospital in The Netherlands PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Hidde ten Berg from the department of Emergency Medicine said Like a lot of people we have been trying out ChatGPT and we were intrigued to see how well it worked for examining some complex diagnostic cases PERIOD

We also found a lot of overlap with the doctors lists of likely diagnoses PERIOD Simply put this indicates that ChatGPT was able suggest medical diagnoses much like a human doctor would PERIOD

For example we included a case of a patient presenting with joint pain that was alleviated with painkillers but redness joint pain and swelling always recurred PERIOD

Based on the physical exam and additional tests the doctors thought the most likely diagnosis was probably rheumatic fever but ChatGPT was correct with its most likely diagnosis of vasculitis.However there is potential here for saving time and reducing waiting times in the emergency department PERIOD

People who need to go to the emergency department want to be seen as quickly as possible and to have their problem correctly diagnosed and treated PERIOD

I look forward to more research in this area and hope that it might ultimately support the work of busy health professionals. originally published on talker.news part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange PERIOD
