Augustana is still in the process of finding a new coach for womens lacrosse PERIOD This search coming after the resignation of Meredith Newman this past spring PERIOD
Former womens head lacrosse coach Meredith Newman left Augustana to go and coach at her alma mater Sweet Briar College PERIOD
It was a very tough decision trying to decide what to do for my future Newman said PERIOD Its hard stepping away from such great student athletes but there is never a good time to leave a program. newman also said that there were other reasons that helped make her decisionsuch as returning to family and friends in Virginia PERIOD
Newman said she is also returning to Sweet Briar College because it is a chance to change the school she graduated from PERIOD
Last month they announced they were going to close the school Newman said PERIOD The school alumni fundraised enough money to recoup the damages from the previous administration PERIOD This opportunity is a chance to coach at my alma mater and be a part of a solution to rebuild the school. augustana Athletic Director Mike Zapolski said the process to hire a new coach began as soon as Newman resigned and they posted job listings on to various recruitment websites PERIOD

Ill be conducting interviews and hopefully well have a new coach by the end of June Zapolski said PERIOD
Zapolski said the next coach they hire will be walking into a solid position with the current roster PERIOD

We did a lot of work over the past two years defining our team and our culture Newman said PERIOD Even though the coach is the leader its the up to the athletes to sustain the program. newman also wrote a farewell letter to the team summing up their achievements and how she taught them everything she knew about lacrosse PERIOD
