Concorde NH  In a televised speech you cant hear the same flutter of camera shutters that must hover like a buzzing fly in the back of a candidates mind PERIOD You see glimpses of the audience but only in reaction to some of the questions PERIOD It can be easy to forget that the speaker has a living audience he is speaking to and that the make up of that audience will influence the candidates words and attitude PERIOD

Newt Gingrich made that point obvious Sunday in a Hudson New Hampshire high school where he began his discussion with a direct appeal to New Hampshire primary votes on the regional Northern Pass issue PERIOD Qubec and Boston want to share electric power he said and to do that they will have to string power lines through beautiful northernNew Hampshire tourismcountry PERIOD But he would push for an alternative underground connection and save the businessdriving beauty of the affected land according to Gingrich PERIOD

The issue is unlikely to come up in any other state besides maybe Massachusetts except in the context of environmental protection or job growth PERIOD What the issue does reveal is that each corner of the nation has its unique needs just as Massachusetts and New Hampshire will be raising debates about energy and the natural landscape the border states may highlight immigration and security and so on with other regional concerns across the wide nation PERIOD The coming months will prove which localized issues will be heard the loudest in the upcoming national presidential debates and now is the best time to witness what concerns constituents are going to emphasizethe economy being an alltime favoriteor how the GOP candidates will distinguish their answers PERIOD As for the Democratic perspective well worry about their contributions once its more certain who theyll be up against PERIOD

Besides drawing my attention to the unique traits of New Hampshire however this weekend has also left me feeling nauseously aware of the calculated routes we have laid out for candidates to win their partys nomination PERIOD Weve seen Rick Santorum and Ron Paul reach across intimate  settings for a deliberate atmosphere of closeness and equality much like sitting in an Occupy Wall Street meeting PERIOD Romney and Gingrich went the way of a more musical pep rally introduction this weekend preferring the prestige of a stage or a podium PERIOD The result is the warmth of a family gathering for the former style a powerhouse of enthusiasm for the latter and an incredible weight of hope and expectation from the audience directed at anyone with the guts or the gall to command the center of each particular debate PERIOD

Ill admit when you experience an isolated rallyRomneys speech in an opera house for instance where you get warm introductions to three of his sons and their extended familyit can be easy to forget how much preparation went into that presentation PERIOD Compare Romneys meeting to Ron Pauls armchair conference directly afterwards in a ruralarea hotel and you begin to think about exactly how much of a candidates speech was calculated for a specific reaction PERIOD Throw in the repetitions between the candidatesthe name  was uttered so many times it could have been a drinking gameand you begin to question how much of his platform a candidate actually believes and how much of his platform was programmed by the GOP and campaign contributors PERIOD

And does it even matter Surely if you like the way people present themselves and their ideas then you will like however they may use their office as the president PERIOD But then consider that theres a huge difference between say liking John Mayers music and looking up to him as a role model PERIOD Im not going to take a stance on whether or not Mayer should run for president my point is simply that this weekend has left me even more unsure whether a persons talent in public will ever translate to an admirable and trustworthy character in private PERIOD



Hofstra enjoys the limelight

Besides witnessing political celebrities and debating contentious issues among ourselves Hofstra goes to New Hampshire has also supplied some students with the chance to speak to prominent candidates and express their opinions to a national audience PERIOD

Ashlyn Grisetti Elisa Tang and Samantha Mulz could be seen speaking to reporters in front of a camera at nearly every event they attended on Sunday afternoon PERIOD In Rochester they sat on stage behind Mitt Romney at both Romneys rally and in Meredith with Ron Paul they were interviewed with bright lights and cameras held to their faces PERIOD

 said Tang who like both of her friends is a firstyear PERIOD 

At the Romney rally the three found themselves subjected to another special treat PERIOD When they were first pulled aside and asked if they would like to sit on stage they did not anticipate that their neighbor would be personally tied to the Romney campaign PERIOD

 said Grisetti PERIOD 

The woman also introduced them to journalists for the Washington Post Tang added PERIOD

 said Mulz and her friends nodded their agreement PERIOD



A stop in Manchester NH exposes students to political protests

When we stopped Sunday evening for dinner in Manchester Professor David Green hoped we might be able to witness some of the towns eccentric street theater PERIOD We were disappointed by relatively quiet streets but one area that drew everyones eyes was that of the colorful signs and tents of an Occupy New Hampshire settlement in Veterans Memorial Park PERIOD One particularly large sign declared the protest as  a reminder that the protesters were well aware of the nearby millionaire candidates and obvious targets of their protest PERIOD

Immediately much of our group moved towards the camp to take in the protesters signs chalk art and costumes PERIOD I joined a conversation with a young journalist who seemed to be especially interested in the way Occupy Wall Street was being perceived in its early stages PERIOD He reminded us that the gap between Rosa Parks protest and the Civil Rights Act was nearly a full decade whereas the Occupy Wall Street movement remains less than four months young PERIOD

His points were interesting and encouraging for anyone who supports the principles behind the movement especially its advocacy for separating money and politics PERIOD Kayla Rivara added some of her thoughts on the power and visibility of the Occupy movement in one of the many many debates brought onto the bus PERIOD

 Rivara said PERIOD She pointed out that the  appearance of the movement however is a tangible mirror of those same high unemployment rates that we now often cite and fear PERIOD

 Rivara said PERIOD 



Bringing politics home to Hofstra

After following this first primary of the year and eyeing the national debates perhaps you wonder how you can get an academic foothold on the many discussions that are sure to come before we host a presidential debate PERIOD

 offered senior Etana Jacobi. students may also be interested in courses offered by the Political Science professors who hosted Hofstra goes to New Hampshire we owe considerable thanks to David Green Rosanna Perotti Richard Himelfarb and Paul Van Wie for organizing a nonstop and highly engaging tour of the primary and its figures PERIOD
