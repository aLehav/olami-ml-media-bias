Northeasterns Panhellenic Council the overarching committee of Greek life has started hosting open presentations to determine which national sorority will be the sixth sorority to join the universitys Greek life PERIOD

After a voting and application process Krystal Beaulieu Northeasterns Panhellenic Council president said three sororities were chosen to compete for the chance to start a colony of their sorority at Northeastern PERIOD A colony refers to a new chapter PERIOD

The three finalists are Kappa Kappa Gamma Zeta Tau Alpha and Kappa Delta PERIOD

Of the  national sororities these three were from the nine who initially applied PERIOD The application process began in May after the decision was made to open the campus for extension the technical term for adding another sorority PERIOD

Northwestern recently opened their campus for extension and they got nine applicants too so the fact that were playing in the same league as them is pretty impressive Beaulieu said PERIOD

There has been talk of adding another sorority for a few years now Beaulieu said but its been difficult to accomplish because a majority of the five sororities on campus need to be in favor of it and some may see adding another sorority as competition PERIOD

Beaulieu said recruitment last year justified the need for a new chapter since  students came out for recruitment  and only  were given spots PERIOD That number increased this year with  coming out for recruitment and  given spots PERIOD

This was huge for us and also disappointing she said PERIOD We had over  women come out for recruitment and there were some smart intelligent really qualified people but because there wasnt enough room they couldnt join. courtney Haskell a middler history major in Delta Zeta is excited to give more students the opportunity to belong to a sorority PERIOD

Im all for the expansion of Greek life PERIOD Its had a big impact on me she said PERIOD

With advisement from their respective national organizations representatives from each sorority on the Panhellenic Council voted  on a secret ballot last spring to add a new sorority PERIOD

Jordana Nahum a middler history major and a member of Delta Phi Epsilon said shes not sure who voted against adding another sorority or why they would PERIOD

This is an exciting prospect she said PERIOD The whole Greek community is excited to support this PERIOD Greek life at Northeastern is different from other schools PERIOD All the sororities here get along with each other PERIOD We definitely want someone who would fit in with that. they are now in the process of seeing presentations made by representatives from each of the three finalists PERIOD Representatives from Kappa Kappa Gamma held their presentation last week and representatives from Zau Tau Alpha held one last night PERIOD Representatives from Kappa Delta will come to campus next week PERIOD

I have worked with these three groups at other schools and they are some of the best in the nation said Chris McGill director of student leadership and engagement PERIOD We are very fortunate at the amount of interest they have in Northeastern. at last weeks event Beaulieu said more than  people attended PERIOD There was a similar turnout last night PERIOD While at least  members of each sorority were asked to attend each presentation those in attendance also included fraternity members and students not involved in Greek life Beaulieu said PERIOD

Thats one of the most important things to us Beaulieu said PERIOD We dont just want a sorority that the other sororities want but we want one that the whole school wants. katie Ryan a middler business major who is in Delta Phi Epsilon said she is looking for a sorority that will adapt to Bostons urban culture PERIOD

This is a big and exciting step she said PERIOD

Deb Ensor the executive director of Zeta Tau Alpha said her sorority is selective in choosing which schools they apply to PERIOD In the same bulletin as the one that announced Northeasterns opening for extension Ensor said there were four or five other openings announced that Zeta Tau Alpha didnt apply for PERIOD

We do our homework also before we express interest in a campus Ensor said PERIOD We also look at the quality of the school and the students and we were extremely impressed with Northeastern. boasting seven colonizations in the last three years Zeta Tau Alpha representatives shared facts of their sorority including details about Think Pink their philanthropic cause PERIOD They also answered questions from the audience like how they will ensure the success of a new colony PERIOD

To do this Zeta Tau Alpha is offering two consultants and a five to  person alumni board PERIOD Beaulieu said this is impressive but comparable to Kappa Kappa Gammas proposals PERIOD

An elected representative from each sorority will vote Nov PERIOD  for the new sorority following a forum for all the members PERIOD

The sorority that wins will become a colony in January and if successful will be installed six to eight weeks later Beaulieu said PERIOD More than  women have already emailed her showing interest she said PERIOD

Beaulieu however would not reveal which sorority she was  most interested in PERIOD

Ask me on Nov PERIOD  she said PERIOD
