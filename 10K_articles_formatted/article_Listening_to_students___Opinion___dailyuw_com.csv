Updated November     pm



  a great bit of advice many of us have heard for years PERIOD So when opinion editor Maureen Trantham invited me to write an editorial for The Daily my first thought was 

Later however I thought rather than writing about what I know maybe I could write about what other people know PERIOD Instead of writing about what I thought was important maybe I could write about what UW students found important PERIOD

So I set up a group on Facebook PERIOD

I called the group  I set the access to open which meant anyone with a UW account could join be seen to others and post to the message board PERIOD

Under the group description I wrote

hello my name is david silver and I teach communication here at UW PERIOD

the daily has invited me to write an editorial sometime this coming SPRING  quarter PERIOD

my goal is to write about a topic that STUDENTS FEEL PASSIONATE ABOUT PERIOD a topic that students find important or inspiring baffling or beautiful PERIOD a topic that students think about  and talk with others about  on a regular basis PERIOD

wont you please help me

please post possible topics for my editorial PERIOD I welcome all topics but favor smartness over snideness intelligence over irony and passion over pessimism PERIOD

this aint no joke PERIOD please post YOUR ideas PERIOD

The response was remarkable PERIOD

UW students wrote long reasoned and serious posts suggesting topics that were timely provocative and deep PERIOD In all more than  students wrote more than  posts PERIOD

Some of the suggested topics were so big they merit their own oneword sentences PERIOD Darfur PERIOD Iraq PERIOD Katrina PERIOD

Some of the suggested topics were more local Rising tuition rates per class and the high costs of living in the dorms PERIOD

Many suggested I write about topics related to contemporary media my topic of teaching and research  They suggested I write about media representations about media consolidation about what happens when media is run not by the people but by the rich PERIOD They suggested I write about new media  about the Internet about iPods and about Facebook PERIOD

Many suggested that I write about race and racism PERIOD Some suggested that I directly challenge the particularly Seattleesque silence that surrounds topics of race not to mention gender sexuality class and disability PERIOD

One student posted a topic idea that was provocative enough to generate an extended discussion something that rarely happens on Facebook PERIOD Suggesting that materialism and consumerism lie at the heart of the American experience she wrote 

For me the fascinating part of the process was being reminded of how deeply UW students care PERIOD For me the remarkable part was that it all took place within Facebook a Web site usually reserved for posting pictures of beer pong PERIOD

According to much of the media too many pundits and too too many UW professors todays college students have effectively checked out PERIOD

College students they say are cynical and sarcastic ironic and insincere PERIOD College students they say devote more time thinking about American Idol than American Empire PERIOD College students they say dont care dont want to care dont know how to care PERIOD

Maybe were just not taking the time to listen PERIOD

I am grateful that so many UW students took the time to be heard PERIOD So many students in fact that too many topics were generated to fit within a single editorial PERIOD Fortunately The Daily has given me permission to return to this space from time to time throughout spring quarter PERIOD

In the meantime lets continue to learn to listen PERIOD

David Silver is an assistant professor of communication at the UW PERIOD He blogs at httpsilverinseattle.blogspot.com PERIOD
