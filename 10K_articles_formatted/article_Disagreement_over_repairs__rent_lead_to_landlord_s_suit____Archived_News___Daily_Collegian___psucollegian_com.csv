As a way of demanding repairs Long and several of his housemates stopped paying rent PERIOD

They did not seek legal advice or take steps to completely understand their responsibilities before taking action and continued to live in the house PERIOD

 asked Thomas Knepp attorney for Cheng PERIOD

Knepp said Long is making false accusations to get out of paying his rent PERIOD

 Knepp said PERIOD 

Texidor who advised Long and his housemates on their case said the tenants had a right to demand repairs but like many students they did not know how to go about it properly PERIOD

 Texidor said PERIOD 

When tenants do not put their complaints and course of action into writing there is no physical proof they did not just decide not to pay rent anymore Texidor said PERIOD

Making phone calls to a landlord like Long said he did allows a landlord to ignore complaints because no record exists Texidor said PERIOD Longs record of his complaints is limited to his medical report from the wasp sting and the letter he wrote PERIOD

No pictures were taken of the apartment and tenants did not list preexisting problems before moving in Long said PERIOD

Texidor said this case is one in which landlords were taking advantage of students ignorance of tenant rights PERIOD

But Knepp said limited knowledge of the law should not be an excuse for students PERIOD

 Knepp said PERIOD
