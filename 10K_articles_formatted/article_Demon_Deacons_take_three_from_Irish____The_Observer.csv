Matthew DeFranks  Sunday March  

Wake Forest used strong pitching Friday and hot bats Sunday to sweep Notre Dame in an ACC series this weekend PERIOD

The Demon Deacons   ACC won Fridays game  before sweeping a doubleheader Sunday with  and  wins over the Irish   PERIOD

All three games were played at Four Winds Field after Saturdays game was moved to Sunday morning because of weather concerns PERIOD The doubleheader was Notre Dames fifth twin bill of the season PERIOD



Wake Forest rode a firstinning run and   shutout innings from senior righthander Jack Fischer to a  win Friday night at Four Winds Field PERIOD

Irish senior righthander Sean Fitzgerald  was the hardluck loser after tossing seven innings allowing just four hits and an unearned run PERIOD It was Fitzgeralds sixth quality start in seven outings PERIOD

To me I think Friday night was kind of the cruelty of baseball Irish coach Mik Aoki said PERIOD

The Demon Deacons scored in the opening frame after a sacrifice fly from redshirt senior first baseman Matt Conway drove in redshirt junior left fielder Grant Shambley who had walked and advanced on a failed pickoff attempt and a single PERIOD

Shambleys run stood up for Wake Forest as Fischer  breezed through the Irish lineup scattering five hits and walking one PERIOD

Notre Dame threatened in the ninth putting runners on second and third with one out after singles by junior center fielder Mac Hudgins and freshman third baseman Kyle Fiala PERIOD Wake Forest redshirt sophomore righthander Aaron Fossas intentionally walked Irish freshman second baseman Cavan Biggio to load the bases PERIOD

But sophomore left fielder Zak Kutsuils grounded into a gameending double play to hand Notre Dame its ninth conference loss PERIOD

Thats one of those things I feel badly for Zak grounding into that double play but at the same time Zaks a kid that runs well enough that he needs to hit it hard at somebody in order for that double play to be a possibility Aoki said PERIOD He hit it well PERIOD He hit it unfortunately at the second baseman and they were able to turn it. fiala led the Irish in the boxscore by going 2for3 with a walk PERIOD



Game  Wake Forest  Notre Dame 

Wake Forests bats exploded for  hits as the Demon Deacons roughed up Irish junior righthander Pat Connaughton and cruised to a  victory in the first game of a doubleheader Sunday PERIOD

Connaughton  lasted just   innings allowing seven runs on nine hits and five walks PERIOD Connaughton struggled with his control as  of his  pitches went for balls PERIOD

If theres an Achilles heel that he has thats what it is Aoki said PERIOD Its always been that way PERIOD Typically as he gets more repetitions he starts getting into the strike zone more a little bit PERIOD It does take him a little bit of time PERIOD

Its tough PERIOD As talented as he is hes competing against kids that are doing it  months of the year. wake Forest scored in the first inning for the second straight game when senior leadoff man and center fielder Evan Stephens scored on an RBI single from Conway PERIOD Stephens reached on a throwing error by Fiala and moved to second on a sacrifice bunt by Shambley PERIOD

The Demon Deacons added two more in the second aided by two Connaughton walks PERIOD After freshman second baseman Nate Mondou popped out to shortstop Connaughton dealt eight straight balls and allowed a bunt single to load the bases with one out PERIOD Senior designated hitter Charlie Morgan drove in sophomore right fielder Joey Rodriguez and Stephens with a tworun single to left PERIOD

The Wake Forest offense scored seven runs in the middle three innings hammering out  hits and sending  men to the plate PERIOD

Morgan led Wake Forest by going 4for5 with a careerhigh four RBI while Stephens scored four runs PERIOD Eight of the nine Wake Forest starters recorded a hit PERIOD

Wake Forest redshirt junior lefthander John McLeod  earned the win by going seven innings and giving up five hits and an unearned run while striking out three PERIOD

Junior first baseman Blaise Lezynski was the lone bright spot for the Irish offense going 3for4 and driving in a run with a thirdinning single PERIOD



Game  Wake Forest  Notre Dame 

Notre Dame scored in each of the first three innings but a fourrun fifth from Wake Forest doomed the Irish in a  loss Sunday afternoon PERIOD

Wake Forest jumped out to a firstinning lead again in Sundays second game when freshman third baseman Will Craig drove in Shambley with a sacrifice fly to center PERIOD Craig drove in Shambley again with a sacrifice fly to center in the third PERIOD

The Irish tied the game in the bottom of the first behind a Hudgins triple and an RBI double from Lezynski PERIOD

Notre Dame chased Wake Forest junior righthander Connor Kaden in the third inning after he walked freshman catcher Ryan Lidge to load the bases with two outs PERIOD Kaden went   innings and gave up four runs all earned on six hits and two walks PERIOD

Wake Forest junior righthander Matt Pirro walked Irish junior right fielder Robert Youngdahl to give Notre Dame a  lead PERIOD Pirro  earned the win for the Demon Deacons PERIOD Fossas picked up his second save of the weekend and his sixth of the season PERIOD

The Demon Deacons turned a tworun deficit into a tworun lead with a fourrun fifth inning highlighted by Mondous pinchhit threerun double PERIOD Wake Forest sent  batters to the plate and left the bases loaded when Morgan popped out to shortshop PERIOD

Irish sophomore lefthander Michael Hearne  gave up six runs on eight hits in   innings in the loss PERIOD

Their offensive approach just didnt match up great with Mike but I thought Mike did a good job battling through it Aoki said PERIOD We swung the bat overall better today but I think most of this just rests with some offensive problems PERIOD We just gotta keep working gotta keep working at it. lezynski continued his hot streak with an RBI single in the sixth that scored junior designated hitter Conor Biggio to trim the deficit to one run PERIOD Lezynski was 6for9 with three RBI in Sundays two games PERIOD

I think without any question hes been absolutely  percent our most consistent guy Aoki said PERIOD I was happy to see him keep it going PERIOD Hes done a really good job buying into the approach were talking to them about. notre Dame will face Valparaiso on Tuesday night at Four Winds Field PERIOD Junior righthander Scott Kerrigan will start for the Irish who topped the Crusaders  on Wednesday PERIOD
