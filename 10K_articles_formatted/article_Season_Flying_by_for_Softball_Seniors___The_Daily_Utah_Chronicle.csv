512,2023-10-23,"hard work and determination is what helps an athlete reach a Division I playing field and athletes often put forth the same amount of effort or even more once they reach that level PERIOD Athletes have to juggle working toward their degrees while participating in a full athletic schedule PERIOD

The seniors on the University of Utah softball team have been living the studentathlete life for the past four years and as their days as Utes are numbered they are taking time to reflect on their time with the program PERIOD

Its exciting and its a lot of different things said senior Katie Donovan.You wait four years to be the senior PERIOD You have to figure out how to lead a lot more than you have had to do in the past PERIOD It is fun to take on those things and to bring up the group of girls who will grow and bring up the program PERIOD There have been lots of different emotions and there will be many more as the season progresses. the three seniors on the team have devoted their past four years to the team and its success and they are now preparing to leave behind a legacy they worked together to build PERIOD All of the hard work and perseverance they have put in is winding down but they will not be forgotten PERIOD These three players are doing their best to pass on all of the wisdom they have garnered in the past few years so they can prepare the younger players for what is coming PERIOD

I just encourage them to remember why we do the things we do and why coach yells at us for certain things there is always a reason said Miranda Viramontes PERIOD We have a culture here and it is very important to keep up with that culture PERIOD It is important as a senior and upperclassman to make sure that they know that and they know what to expect going forward. since softball is a spring sport these seniors are wrapping up both their academic and athletic careers at the same time and there is a lot of pressure on them to keep up responsibilities on both ends  they are not able to relax yet because they are still working hard to keep up their softball game and their grades PERIOD Graduation is just around the corner but there are still a lot of activities happening between now and then PERIOD

Its really bittersweet PERIOD Im not an emotional person or anything so I was like cool Im a senior but then a couple of days ago I picked up my cap and gown and it really hit me said Heather Bowen PERIOD Im not looking forward to having to pay bills and go do adult stuff so Im just trying to enjoy my time here while I can. by being a part of a closeknit team these players have created a second home at the U with their softball family PERIOD

The girls I get to share all of these experiences with Ive never been closer to a group of girls before Bowen said PERIOD We have a really good bond with each other. emailprotected
