Annette GordonReed discusses the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings during her lecture The Hemings Family  Life After Monticello. bY ANNA KANE 

I originally thought of myself as a writer PERIOD But history gripped me said speaker Annette GordonReed a Charles Warren professor of American legal history at Harvard Law School and professor of history in the faculty of arts and sciences at Harvard University PERIOD She was addressing the crowd gathered in Gamble Auditorium on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

I had great social studies and history teachers PERIOD I had an experience of integrating my school district when I was six PERIOD This was long after Brown v PERIOD Board of Education but my district had been resisting it she said PERIOD At a young age I could make a connection to things that were happening to me and the point we had gotten to PERIOD My life in some ways was part of a history so that and my great teachers are the reason I became a historian. according to the Colleges website after Professor John Laxs death in the 1970s his parents  who were both math professors at New York University  created the Endowed John Lax Memorial Lecture in  PERIOD The Lax Lecture is given annually by a historian of high distinction who makes the latest advances of history accessible to the public PERIOD

GordonReed presented her work as part of the Mount Holyokes  John Lax Memorial Lecture PERIOD During the presentation she spoke about her research on the Hemings family and Thomas Jefferson in a lecture titled The Hemings Family  Life after Monticello. her first book Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings An American Controversy brought validity to decades worth of rumors that founding father Thomas Jefferson had fathered several children by his slave Sally Hemings PERIOD The following year DNA tests of known descendants of both Jefferson and Hemings corroborated GordonReeds findings PERIOD GordonReeds work indirectly led to an exhibit at Monticello dedicated to Sally Hemings which opened in  PERIOD

The halfsister of Jeffersons late wife Martha Hemings was a slave who arrived at Monticello as a toddler PERIOD She shared the same father as Martha John Wayles but her mother was a slave PERIOD

In  at the age of  Hemings accompanied Jefferson and his daughter Martha to Paris where Hemings was free PERIOD She refused to return to Virginia with Jefferson until he promised her extraordinary privileges including freeing any children they had together when they reached the age of  PERIOD

When the pair returned to the States in  Hemings was pregnant PERIOD The nature of the relationship between Jefferson and Hemings is largely unknown but as an enslaved woman Hemings had no legal right to consent PERIOD

Hemings is believed to have had at least six children by Jefferson four of whom  Beverly Harriet Madison and Eston  survived to adulthood PERIOD Each child was enslaved at Monticello Thomas Jeffersons home until they were freed by Jefferson at the age of  PERIOD

According to the Monticello website Jefferson owned as many as  slaves in his lifetime and only freed seven PERIOD All were members of the extended Hemings family including his four children PERIOD Sally Hemings was never legally freed PERIOD

According to GordonReed after Jeffersons death in  the Hemings children moved away from Monticello PERIOD Harriet and Beverly lived as wealthy white people but were forced to conceal their heritage and cut ties with their mother and siblings in order to do so PERIOD Their ties to Jefferson were largely forgotten about until the 1970s PERIOD At that time Jeffersons paternity was denounced by scholars despite the fact that masters having children with their slaves was not uncommon PERIOD

What kind of freedom do you have if you have to reject your mother GordonReed said PERIOD Its a legacy of slavery and you can see it based on the different tracks the family took and what they wanted to call themselves. eston and Madison remained in the black community and moved to Chillicothe Ohio with other mixedrace people who were freed from slavery by their white fathers PERIOD They shared their family history with their children PERIOD This is a mixed up family a mixed up situation PERIOD What I think is fascinating to me is that theyre not the only people doing this GordonReed said PERIOD People are creating their own identities and crafting their own stories for themselves. gordonReeds forthcoming project A Jefferson Reader On Race seeks to determine how Harriet Beverly and their descendants were accepted as white and the reasons behind why they didnt speak of their connection to their mother PERIOD

These are the connections I want to parse out because its about a family but its also about America PERIOD Are we any better than we were in the nineteenth century Id like to think so but Im not sure we are GordonReed said PERIOD

The two lines of the Hemings family provides an example of the benefits of whiteness PERIOD While the Madison line did well for themselves it was not able to do as well as the lines that descended from Harriet and Beverly PERIOD

It reiterates something that we know this has always been a mixed country said GordonReed PERIOD Its always been a country where its easier to be white than black. olivia Zhou  was struck by the fact that members of the Hemings family had to choose which relatives to stay in contact with in order to successfully pass as white PERIOD

It brings home the personal costs that this countrys history of racism has imposed on African Americans and minorities in general said Zhou PERIOD GordonReeds talk also illuminated how complex and constructed racial identities in America are. jefferson never publicly acknowledged his paternity of the Hemings children PERIOD

According to GordonReed Jeffersons decision not to publicly claim his children with Hemings showed that the pair and their children had a clear understanding of both slavery and freedom as well as what each meant and their reallife implications PERIOD Had Jefferson publicly acknowledged the children he had with Hemings Harriet and Beverly would not have had the opportunity to live as white people PERIOD

Maggie Murphy  found GordonReeds talk interesting in its examination of the dangers that come with applying modernday morals to historical figures as there are expectations people put on Thomas Jefferson that he should have openly claimed the Hemings children as his own put into contrast with the actual consequences that those actions would have taken according to Murphy PERIOD

Izzy Baird  said GordonReed said that its not necessarily useful to write about whether or not people did the things you want them to do but rather how they crafted ideas and lives regardless of modernday opinions. the Hemings family is a very relevant example of how important interracial relations and interactions have been in the formation and development of this country Zhou said PERIOD By focusing on this mixedrace family and its deep complicated connections to Jefferson GordonReeds research underscores the need to undo the extensive whitewashing that Americas perception of history often undergoes. im ultimately accused of trying to destroy Thomas Jefferson and trying to protect him GordonReed said PERIOD People are unsure what my agenda is PERIOD Its neither to destroy nor prop him up. tagged Anna Kane Annette GordonReed
