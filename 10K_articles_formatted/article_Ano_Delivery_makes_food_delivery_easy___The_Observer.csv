Ano Delivery is a local business started by two CWU students Dante Palmisano and Juan Zamorano whose last names both end with ano. through their website anodelivery.com customers can order food from any restaurant in Ellensburg and have it delivered to their door for a fee which can be as low as  PERIOD

Palmisano and Zamorano met at work washing dishes and were inspired to start the business after a previous delivery company Ellensburg Delivery stopped operation PERIOD

One day I just remember looking at Dante in the eyes and I was really serious Zamorano said PERIOD I was like tomorrow were starting a food delivery business PERIOD And then that next day we met upstairs in the SURC and we started planning it out. that was January and after three months of planning web design and meeting with local restaurants Ano Delivery was up and running in April PERIOD

The company currently doesnt have any employees save a couple of volunteers and only operates from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD on most days PERIOD These scheduled hours allow the small crew to guarantee service for all orders as opposed to most appbased delivery services which are dependant on driver availability PERIOD

Ano Delivery differentiates itself from companies like Uber Eats and Postmates with its wide selection of restaurants.Their service plugs certain businesses as associates on their website but they will deliver from any restaurant in town regardless PERIOD

We went to every single restaurant there are about  resturaunts in town Palmisano said PERIOD The reason why we choose the term associate is because were not binding them to any contract with us were just working closely with them PERIOD Its almost like a friendship or a mutual understanding. the Anos tried their best to keep their prices reasonable thinking about what they themselves would pay for the service and settled on a flat  fee with some stipulations PERIOD For the most part everything in Ellensburg is within a 5mile radius so gas prices and delivery times arent among their top concerns PERIOD

The work is paying off according to Palmisano and Zamorano PERIOD They make between  and  deliveries a day PERIOD

If we could scale it up to around  or  that would be so cool we could start hiring more people Zamorano said PERIOD But thats kinda more big picture. in the future Ano Delivery hopes to expand the scope of their deliveries PERIOD They have their eyes set on groceries alcohol and possibly even cannabis delivery PERIOD

The service is always working to improve their interface according to Palmisano PERIOD They hope to improve their website over the coming months and start development on a dedicated Ano Delivery App PERIOD

Ano delivery can be ordered through their website anodelivery.com or via call or text at   PERIOD
