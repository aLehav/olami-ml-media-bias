NEW DELHI AP  The worlds fastest pace of spreading infections and the highest daily increase in coronavirus cases are pushing India further into a deepening and deadly health care crisis PERIOD

India is massive  its the worlds secondmost populous country with nearly . billion people  and its size presents extraordinary challenges to fighting COVID19 PERIOD

Some . million vaccine doses are given daily but thats still less than  of its people whove gotten their first shot PERIOD OverallIndiahas confirmed . million cases of infection the second highest after the United States and  deaths PERIOD

The latest surge has driven Indias fragile health systems tothe breaking point Understaffed hospitals are overflowing with patients PERIOD Medical oxygen is in short supply PERIOD Intensive care units are full PERIOD Nearly all ventilators are in use and the dead are piling up at crematoriums and graveyards PERIOD

HOW DID WE GET HERE

Authorities were lulled into believing the worst was behind them whencases started to recede in September PERIOD

Cases dipped for  consecutive weeks before starting to rise in midFebruary and experts say the country failed to seize the opportunity to augment healthcare infrastructure and aggressively vaccinate PERIOD

We were so close to success said Bhramar Mukherjee a biostatistician at the University of Michigan who has been tracking Indias pandemic PERIOD

Despite warnings and advice that precautions were needed authorities were unprepared for the magnitude of the surge said K Srinath Reddy president of the Public Health Foundation of India PERIOD

Critics have pointed to the government deciding to not pause Hindu religious festivals or elections and experts say that these may have exacerbated the surge PERIOD

Authorities across India without exception put public health priorities on the back burner Reddy said PERIOD

Consequently Indias 7day rolling average of confirmed daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from . new cases per  people on April  to . new cases per  people on April  possibly driven by new variants of the virusincluding one that was first detected in India experts say PERIOD

Indias top health official Rajesh Bhushan would not speculate Wednesday why authorities could have been better prepared saying Today is not the time to go into why did we miss or did we miss did we prepare

WHY IS INDIAS HEALTH SYSTEM COLLAPSING

India only spends a fraction of its gross domestic product on its health system lower than most major economies PERIOD

As the virus took hold last year India imposed a harsh nationwide lockdown for months to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed PERIOD This broughtterrible hardshipto millions but also bought time to implement measures to plug critical gaps like hiring additional health care workers on shortterm contracts establishing field hospitals and installing hospital beds in banquet halls PERIOD

But authorities didnt take a longterm view of the pandemic said Dr PERIOD Vineeta Bal who studies immune systems at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune city PERIOD

Suggestions for permanent improvements like adding capacity to existing hospitals or hiring more epidemiologists to help track the virus were widely ignored she said PERIOD Now authorities are scrambling to resuscitate many emergency measures that had been ended once the numbers fell PERIOD

A year ago India was able to avoid the shortages of medical oxygenthat plagued Latin America and Africaafter it converted industrial oxygen manufacturing systems into a medicalgrade network PERIOD

But many facilities went back to supplying oxygen to industries and now several Indian states face such shortages that the Health Ministry has urged hospitals to implement rationing PERIOD

The government in October began building new plants to produce medical oxygen but now some six months later it remains unclear whether any have come on line with the Health Ministry saying they were being closely reviewed for early completion. tanks of oxygen are being shuttled across the country to hotspots to keep up with the demand and several state governments have alleged that many have been intercepted by other states en route to be used to meet local needs PERIOD

WHAT COMES NEXT

India is faced with the massive challenge of trying to prevent its health care system from further collapse until enough people can be vaccinated to significantly reduce the flow of patients PERIOD

The good news is that India is a major vaccine producer but even after halting large exports of vaccines in March to divert them to domestic use there are still questions of whether manufactures can produce enough fast enough PERIOD

Vaccination is one way to slow down the spread  but this really depends on the speed and availability of the shots said Reddy of the Public Health Foundation PERIOD

Already several states have said they have shortages in vaccines  although the federal government denies it PERIOD

India said last week it would allow the use of all COVID19 shots that have been greenlit by the World Health Organization or regulators in the United States Europe Britain or Japan PERIOD

On Monday it said it would soon expand its vaccination program from people aged  to include all adults some  million people  well more than the entire population of the entire European Union and United States combined PERIOD

Meanwhile Reddy said some states have had to implement new lockdowns but longterm it was up to individuals as well to do their part PERIOD

As a society its crucial that we maintain public health measures like masking physical distancing and avoiding crowds he said PERIOD
