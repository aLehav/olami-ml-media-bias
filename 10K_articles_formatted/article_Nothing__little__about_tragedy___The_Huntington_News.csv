On Friday morning Rhode Island state attorney general Patrick Lynch stepped to the podium of a news conference and declared

They say that in the world theres six degrees of separation PERIOD In Rhode Island its more like one and a half degrees. he wasnt lying PERIOD

Those Rhode Island reporters present didnt need to know this PERIOD They knew it already PERIOD It was the mass media the FOX news the CNN reporters who had probably never even heard of West Warwick RI who needed to be told PERIOD

Maybe Im biased but I think Rhode Island has more character per square mile than any other state in the union PERIOD Only in Rhode Island is  minutes away the boonies. only in Rhode Island is a cabinet a milkshake and a bubbla what everyone else calls a water fountain PERIOD Only in Rhode Island do we frequently refer to places as where something else used to be. you might have seen R.I PERIOD Governor Don Carcieri referring to the Station night club as where an Italian restaurant used to be PERIOD Some people say that Rhode Islanders have the same accent as New Yorkers or Bostonians but I say its a Rhode Island accent PERIOD

When I saw that one of my roommates this year was from Smithfield R.I. i was excited because my dad worked in Smithfield PERIOD In some states this would mean nothing PERIOD But sure enough that one and a half degrees was that my father had taught her good friend tennis while in high school PERIOD In Rhode Island that is the only connection we needed PERIOD Its like we knew each other forever PERIOD

So when I heard about the fire in Warwick that had claimed the lives of so many Rhode Islanders I didnt think Oh I wonder if I know anybody I thought Who do I know

On any other night with any other band I have several friends that would have attended this club and it wrenches me to think of this possibility PERIOD As it is a friend of mine from high schools sister is missing and my heart goes out to him PERIOD One and a half degrees 

My point in all this Understanding PERIOD

Understanding that to Rhode Island this is a death toll equivalent to September  PERIOD There are  Rhode Islanders and  New Yorkers   multiplied by  equals   the same amount of people that died in the World Trade Centers Twin Towers PERIOD Granted this is not a terrorist act but it was unexpected and those involved were unprepared PERIOD In todays world  people can be considered a small loss of life but to Rhode Island it is a calculable segment of our tiny population PERIOD

This story will lose its spot on the front page soon and as a journalism major I can understand that it is just the business PERIOD Bigger better and hopefully brighter news will be the headline by tomorrow PERIOD  But just know that this tragedy will be spoken of every day by someone in my home state PERIOD A hole has been dug in our community and the states collective heart has been broken PERIOD

I know that Massachusetts certainly doesnt qualify as a BIG state and that those who live here certainly have an understanding of what its like to be small but I think it is different for Rhode Island PERIOD It is our claim to fame the smallest state in the country PERIOD And I am proud to be from where I am PERIOD I have always been and I always will be PERIOD Rhode Island should be known as the greatest little state in the country even though some people actually believe it is an island off the coast of New York PERIOD And for you Rhode Islanders I know you understand PERIOD
