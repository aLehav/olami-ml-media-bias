ClarificationAli Khademhosseini is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard University visiting UT for the fall  semester PERIOD

Two UT scientists earned  Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers for work in their independent research careers PERIOD

Ali Khademhosseini Harrington Faculty Fellow in the biomedical engineering department and assistant biology professor Sara Sawyer won the award which was established by President Bill Clinton in  PERIOD The awards are coordinated by the White Houses Office of Science and Technology Policy PERIOD

Khademhosseini received the award because his contributions to microengineering such as the generation of controlled microscale environments and regulation of cell behavior and fabrication of tissuelike structures according to a release PERIOD

Our research is based on generating biological tissues that can be transplanted into patients to treat various diseases Khademhosseini said PERIOD The ability to generate tissues outside the body can be used to alleviate the challenge in a lack of organ donors PERIOD We combine cells and materials to develop tissues that mimic the function of the natural organs. sawyer received the award in the department of Health and Human Services because of her research on the evolution of DNA repair genes PERIOD The research is providing insight on both the formation of cancers and susceptibility to viral infection according toa release PERIOD

Using approaches based on evolutionary theory we have done things such as creating a novel antiHIV gene that is now under therapeutic development at Stanford Sawyer said and discovering new human genes that are now
	being investigated for their association with HIV susceptibility inhuman trial groups. sixteen federal departments and agencies nominated scientists and engineers whose early work showed promise and contribution to the departments and agencies missions PERIOD The candidates were then forwarded to the White House for final selections PERIOD

Khademhosseini was nominated by the U.S PERIOD Office of Naval Research which he is working with to produce microfabricated tissues that act as musclelike actuators in robotic components PERIOD

An official at the National Institute of Health nominated Sawyer for the award PERIOD

A couple years ago the official was attending a study session where one of my grant applications was being discussed by a panel of research scientists and she became intrigued by the work that I am doing Sawyer said PERIOD She funded my grant and has kept in touch with me since that point. later this month Khademhosseini and Sawyer will be among the scientists and engineers who will personally receive their awards from President Barack Obama PERIOD
