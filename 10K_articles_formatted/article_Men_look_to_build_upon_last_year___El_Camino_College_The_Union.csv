8650,2023-06-04,"after a  record and a  second place finish in the South Coast conference last season the mens basketball team is putting its focus on shutting down the opposition PERIOD

So far in this early season the men are  with a win against L.A PERIOD Trade Tech and a loss to West L.A PERIOD Assistant coach Ronnie Green said the team remains optimistic and is looking forward to build from last year PERIOD

Green said he thinks that this years team is a more physical athletic group of individuals who work hard and are willing to do anything to win PERIOD

This years team is definitely a more physical athletic group Green said PERIOD They work extremely hard and are willing to do anything it takes to win ball games and that is what its all about. with eight new freshmen and only three returning sophomores Green said the team is putting more emphasis on defense since the new players are still trying to get accustomed to the system PERIOD

At the moment the team is playing a run n gun type system where they look to get easy baskets so that it will be easier for the players to score PERIOD

Defense has always been a top priority in former coach Paul Landreauxs system Green said PERIOD If you can shut teams down then you have a chance to win ballgames PERIOD Your offense comes and goes so you definitely have to stop people from scoring PERIOD Our team this year will look to run after a rebound and get easy buckets along with exploiting mismatches since we are so athletic. a problem so far for the team hasnt been about Xs and Os but Green said the problem is some of the players have been nervous when the game starts PERIOD

He said the team comes out flat and instead of just relaxing and playing the game some of the players are thinking too much PERIOD

Once the lights come on they freeze for some reason Green said PERIOD In practice they play well the whole time and in the games they freeze in the beginning PERIOD Once the second half comes along they get in their groove but sometimes it might be too late. small forward and captain Kris Lowry said the focus this year is all about trying to add another championship banner PERIOD

Lowry who is averaging  points and six rebounds through the first two games said the team made crucial mistakes during last years games when they mattered PERIOD

We cant make the same mistakes we made last year Lowry said PERIOD In order for us to add another championship banner we have to play shutdown defense and play together as a unit. lowry one of three captains on the team is trying his best to help the new freshmen adjust to the college level of play PERIOD He also thinks that this years team is a closer group hopefully it will carry over to the basketball court PERIOD

The college game is totally different Lowry said PERIOD Im trying to help them adapt because players on this level are a lot stronger faster and athletic. one of the Warriors new players point guard Lavon Myers is a L.A PERIOD junior college transfer PERIOD Though being a point guard on a new team and having to learn a new system might be a challenge for others PERIOD

Basketball is basketball you just go out and play Myers who is averaging  points and six rebounds said PERIOD I just try to push the tempo and play hardnosed defense. myers goal along with the rest of the team is to win first place in the South Coast conference then go deep in the playoffs and hopefully getting a shot at the championships PERIOD

Its all about winning Myers said PERIOD It doesnt matter who scores or who gets the glory as long as we win. the student news site of El Camino College",Men look to build upon last year - El Camino College The Union,El Camino College
