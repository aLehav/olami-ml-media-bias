Rarely can six words carry such enormous solemnity PERIOD



As a society we define ourselves through poignant quotes and insight the writing of history is normally left to the eloquent

That all changed in  when Rodney King battered bruised posed this momentous questioncant we all just get alongsix words encompassing centuries of vitriolic brutality PERIOD

Regardless of intention the gravity of Kings proposition was not exclusive to Los Angeles the struggle to get along seems the definitive failure of man PERIOD

And so  years after the L.A PERIOD riots with Kings death still fresh in our collective memory evaluating our nations progress seems immensely critical PERIOD

Kings legacy was defined two decades ago on L.A.s cold pavement PERIOD Americas however has not yet been established PERIOD With that in mind we must revisit Kings case and ask ourselves one simple albeit daunting question how far have we come

Unfortunately pointing to Barack Obama offers little insight to progress PERIOD Not to denigrate the Presidents achievements but a countrys successes and failures cannot be summarized by simply pointing to one mantrue understanding necessitates deep analysis PERIOD

Unfortunately such analysis indicates that our country has shown minimal progress since  PERIOD

A Harvard study found that discrimination towards African Americans has steadily declined since the 1950s PERIOD The survey which measures how black and white students have perceived racism since the 50s is undoubtedly optimistic for our nation PERIOD However perceiving discrimination is far different than real overt racism PERIOD

Because the case has not yet been resolved it would be unfair to point to the Trayvon Martin case as an example of racism today PERIOD However many other cases indicate that prejudice might still be prevalent amongst some law enforcement PERIOD

Take for example the death of Kenneth Chamberlain a 68yearold Vietnam veteran and U.S PERIOD Marine killed by police in his New York apartment PERIOD Audio from the incident includes the use of racial slurs by the officer who killed Chamberlain PERIOD

Granted it would be unfair to label all police as prejudiced just as it would be unfair to label a race by the actions of a few PERIOD Outside of these isolated incidents however it still seems that the odds are stacked against minorities PERIOD

In   of African Americans were paying what the U.S PERIOD government calls highcost mortgages PERIOD Only  of Caucasians paid the same rates perpetuating what many see as predetermined failure for the black community PERIOD

Things arent much better for the Hispanic community of which  pay highcost mortgages PERIOD Even worse over the last decade racial prejudices have been fueled by large immigration waves PERIOD

Reports show that TSA agents are much more likely to profile Hispanics than they are other Americans PERIOD These reports even go as far as citing a group of agents labeled The Great Mexican Hunters as conducting searches based purely on racial prejudices PERIOD

This perception of Hispanics has even permeated into our legislature PERIOD Senate Bill  passed in  allows Arizona police to question a persons citizenship should there be any reasonable doubt. responding to criticism Gov PERIOD Jan Brewer gave this pearl of wisdomwe just have to trust our law enforcement. apparently Brewer doesnt understand that for many minorities police are not always worth trusting PERIOD The L.A PERIOD riots stand as testament to the idea that police while predominantly righteous can still be motivated by prejudices PERIOD

While these examples do not paint a full picture of racism today they do show that discrimination is hardly fleeting PERIOD Since  progress has been made PERIOD

The extent of that progress however may not be boastworthy PERIOD Americas collective memory seems a bit short and though we did learn some valuable lessons in L.A. two decades later they seem forgotten PERIOD

Ill leave you with the words of another civil rights figure also named King with who you may be familiar

We must live to learn together as brothers or perish together as fools. john Downen can be reached at
