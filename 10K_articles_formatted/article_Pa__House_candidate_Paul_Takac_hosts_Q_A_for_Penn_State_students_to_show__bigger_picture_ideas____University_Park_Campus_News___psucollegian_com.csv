State Representative Paul Takac hosts a question and answer session with Penn State students on Wednesday April   at University Park Pa PERIOD

Paul Takac candidate for eighty-second District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives visited Penn State on Wednesday for a QA session titled QA with Your Candidate Meet Paul with students PERIOD

The event was hosted by PSU Students for Takac an organization seeking to share information about the new eighty-second District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives hold nonpartisan voter registration efforts and debates and empower students to participate in the democratic process according to its website PERIOD

Were at a really critical and important time in history Takac said PERIOD With redistricting and the changes that have recently happened your voice really does matter in terms of where the state of Pennsylvania can go in the future. in February the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled to enact a new congressional map to reflect population changes gathered from the  U.S PERIOD Census and this new map marks the first time the entire Penn State campus will be in the same district according to Takac PERIOD

You are a critical part of not only this community but youre a critical part of this district Takac said PERIOD For the first time in a long time folks who are running in office have to really pay attention. whats really important he said is what matters to Penn State students and then students began asking about his reasons for running for office PERIOD

Takac said after decades of seeing democracy being undermined individual rights being under attack education being underfunded and support for unions being reducted the United States is beginning to see the consequences PERIOD

The solution to this he said is to focus on state legislatures PERIOD

A lot of those things that affect peoples everyday lives and students everyday lives happen at the state legislature Takac said PERIOD I just think my combination of life experiences individual experience and local government experience really lends itself to that. the most fun thing about campaigning for Takac is having an excuse to talk to people about what matters to them PERIOD

We go out we make phone calls we knock on doors and we get to ask people What matters in your life he said PERIOD Whats cooler than that

Events such as the QA help counter the challenge of bringing his bigger picture ideas to a wider audience he said PERIOD

Equity in education investment in infrastructure investing in the economy and the environment at the same time  those are things that really are important Takac said PERIOD

One student asked about Republican Justin Behrens Takacs opponent for the  general election in the fall PERIOD

I wont comment on his qualifications but Ive talked about my qualifications Takac said PERIOD

He said his qualifications include being a member of the community raising his family and volunteering in the community and planning to stay here forever. i actually understand the town  I understand how important the Penn State student community is to our overall community he said PERIOD Thats something that someone from the outside may not really understand. student Brooklynn Jones asked why Penn State students should choose Takac to represent our campus. in response he said hes worked.. PERIOD in and around education his entire career has two sons in college and believes he understands some of the issues students and the university are facing PERIOD

I would like to be your voice in Harrisburg to make sure that the funding the resources and the support are there to help students and help the university going forward Takac said PERIOD

Michael Garza freshmancriminology and sociology listens to his peer ask a question to State Representative Paul Takac on Wednesday April   in University Park Pa PERIOD

Michael Garza asked how he would provide equitable education resources for marginalized students  something that Takac said was one of the reasons he started running for election PERIOD

Pennsylvania is one of the bottom five states nationally in investing in both K12 and higher education he said PERIOD What that means is that they push the burden onto local communities. this impacts marginalized communities with less affluent school districts Takac said PERIOD

As a solution he brought up a fair funding formula that he said the state knows about and has not invested in with the potential to level the playing field. takac said the legislature in Harrisburg is refusing to use billions of dollars in federal aid to fund initiatives PERIOD

If we have an opportunity to change the legislature and make it a democratic legislature  we can put that money to good use he said PERIOD This is about economic justice and this is about educational justice and equity. on the topic of educational justice Takac spoke on crushing student loans as well as students who are unable to start or finish college PERIOD

Theres no more important investment we can make than in education in my mind he said PERIOD

Another student Igor Latsanych asked about Takacs plans to work with correctional centers PERIOD

Takac said his focus is on restorative and rehabilitative justice while paying attention to the longterm consequences of mass incarceration PERIOD

He said hes working with Pardon Project Centre County which he said is a group that can forgive your sentence through a board of pardons and appeals after a sentence has been served PERIOD

A question was then asked about Takacs stance on recreational marijuana use for adults PERIOD

I think its far past time that we legalize recreational marijuana he said PERIOD

Takac cited new revenue sources medicinal purposes and decriminalization as a pathway to restorative justice and as reasons for legalization PERIOD

There are a lot of people who have convictions for nonviolent drug offenses that I think we could revisit he said PERIOD It only makes sense and its worked in other places  I think it can be regulated. jones freshmancriminology and psychology asked what Takac would do to lower the numbers of sexual assaults on Penn States campus PERIOD

Everyone should expect to be safe and secure and Penn State has a responsibility to ensure that environment he said PERIOD

Education awareness and holding people accountable are some ways to do this Takac said PERIOD

When something happens you have to support the survivor  you have to do a thorough and rapid investigation he said PERIOD Looking back Penn State hasnt had a good reputation with that. sexual assault prevention is also a community effort Takac said and more resources and creative solutions are needed PERIOD

If were going to talk about justice  if were going to talk about human dignity we have to do that in a comprehensive way he said PERIOD We need to make sure that everyone in the community has very clear support services and advocacy. on the subject of accountability Takac was asked about how Penn State handled coronavirus regulations PERIOD

In regard to masking mandates he said the universitys Board of Trustees was influenced politically in a way that may not have represented the true health and wellbeing of the university PERIOD

In an open letter sent to the Penn State community Aug PERIOD  following backlash toward coronavirus protocol President Eric Barron said the universitys mitigation efforts cover  in a way that incites  as there are widely differing opinions across the nation PERIOD

 Barron said in the letter PERIOD 

Josh Portney juniorbroadcast journalism listens to State Representative Paul Takac during the question and answer event on Wednesday April   in University Park Pa PERIOD

Takac said he doesnt agree with this approach PERIOD

I do not think its the role of a legislator to essentially hold funding hostage to the university Takac said PERIOD We need to empower the university it should not be a political question it should be a medical and a public health question. he said it was unfortunate the pandemic was politicized. i will not play politics with the mission or needs of the university or the students Takac said PERIOD

Latsanych freshmaninternational relations asked how Takac plans to support Ukrainians to which he said making funding available to express solidarity and looking for ways to support refugees were options at the state level PERIOD

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb PERIOD  and fighting has continued throughout the country PERIOD

On the topic of student loans Takac said he thinks a student loan forgiveness program is important as well as reducing the need to take out so many loans. it really is a crisis  I have talked to so many people who are living under crushing debt he said PERIOD It keeps them from starting families or buying a home or moving forward with their life. takac said powerful options are loan forgiveness programs that encourage people to fill highneed jobs or move to a depopulating area PERIOD

If were going to invest in the future we need to invest in the future he said PERIOD

Erin Heim the finance director of Takacs campaign commented on how she never once had a candidate for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives come and talk to students while she was in college PERIOD

Heim said she decided to join the campaign because she was incredibly excited for an opportunity to bring more blue to Centre County PERIOD

To see that theres actually an area that we could make a big difference in was something I really wanted to be a part of she said PERIOD

She asked Takac why representatives dont pay more visits to colleges PERIOD

Quite frankly I think youre taken for granted Takac said PERIOD This community wouldnt exist without Penn State students not enough people are thankful youre here. the other reason he said college students are taken for granted is because people dont believe students are engaged enough to bother to vote. because of the way our political system is structured people dont think students are motivated enough to vote Takac said PERIOD Thats an assumption I think we need to challenge. the beauty of the eighty-second District in modern times he said is that unlike other Republican or Democratmajority districts it is competitive. your vote here matters more because it has a greater chance to make a difference right here today than maybe back where you were at home Takac said PERIOD If you register here now and vote here now  your vote could be the one that decides who goes to Harrisburg. mORE CAMPUS COVERAGE
