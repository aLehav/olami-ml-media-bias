The Boilermakers  a . point favorite had five turnovers that cost them the game PERIOD

Sophomore wide receiver Rondale Moore and senior quarterback Elijah Sindelar controlled the game in the first half PERIOD Moore had eight catches for  yards and one touchdown at the break PERIOD

However the AllAmerica candidate was held to three catches and just  yards in the second half PERIOD

Moore had four receptions on the first drive leading Purdue down the field PERIOD Sindelar was able to connect with senior tight end Brycen Hopkins for a touchdown to cap off the drive PERIOD

On the offensive side of the ball we moved the ball pretty well and had some yards head coach Jeff Brohm said in a press conference Monday PERIOD We werent great in the running game PERIOD I dont know if were going to be great at the point of attack at some positions but weve got to get better at that PERIOD We have to establish that take a little bit of pressure off the passing game. defensively the Boilermakers came out dominant early only giving up three total yards in Nevadas first two drives PERIOD Junior defensive end Derrick Barnes was even able to come up with a sack on the oneyard line PERIOD

Purdue quickly marched up the field on its second drive but was unable to score a touchdown in the red zone and instead had to settle for a field goal PERIOD Those  points gave the Boilers a  lead PERIOD

The defense once again came up big quickly retiring the Wolf Packs drive PERIOD Purdue was unable to capitalize though as freshman wide receiver Milton Wright fumbled a reception resulting in a turnover PERIOD

Nevada was not able to score until around the fourminute mark PERIOD Freshman quarterback Carson Strong threw a dime to receiver Dominic Christian for the touchdown PERIOD

Sindelar quickly responded on the next drive PERIOD He threw a 38yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Jackson Anthrop on a signature Brohm trick play PERIOD Purdue took a  lead with about two minutes remaining in the half PERIOD

The Boilers got a quick three and out from their defense setting the offense up for a twominute drill PERIOD Sindelar once again took command and capped off another drive with another touchdown throw this time to Moore to end the first half PERIOD

Defensively Purdue continued to manhandle Nevada at the start of the second half PERIOD The Wolf Pack was only able to move the chains one time before punting the ball back to the Boilers PERIOD Purdues defensive line was able to consistently put pressure on Nevadas quarterback rushing all of his decisions PERIOD

Purdue was unable to score on their next drive and Nevada began to gain momentum PERIOD The Wolf Pack recovered a fumble after a botched punt recovery scoring immediately after on a spectacular grab from wide receiver Elijah Cooks PERIOD

Sindelar quickly put out the fire throwing a 49yard bomb to freshman wide receiver David Bell on a flea flicker for a touchdown PERIOD That score gave Purdue a  lead over Nevada PERIOD

The Wolf Pack was unable to score the next drive but another special teams fumble lead to a Nevada field goal PERIOD

A turnover sent Purdues defense back onto the field but they were able to hold up again and force a punt PERIOD

Although the Boilers held a lead for most of the game the team had four turnovers in the first three quarters which came back to bite them late in the fourth quarter PERIOD Nevada put together a touchdown drive making it a onepossession game PERIOD

We have to fix the mistakes we made and be men about it Brohm said PERIOD As coaches with myself on down weve got to coach better and make sure that we can get our guys to play efficient hardnosed football the entire game. purdue was unable to score the next drive giving Nevada the chance to tie up the game with three minutes remaining PERIOD Nevada began to storm up the field making play after play to extend the drive and chew up the clock in the process PERIOD

The defense came up big again with sophomore defensive back Kenneth Major producing a near interception to stop a Nevada touchdown that would have tied up the game PERIOD Major was also targeted the very next possession and interrupted another touchdown to keep the Boilermaker lead alive PERIOD He went down with an injury and Nevada scored the very next play tying the game at  PERIOD

The turnover bug bit Purdue again as Sindelar threw an interception trying to squeeze the ball to Bell PERIOD Nevada stormed into field goal position and made a 56yard kick to win PERIOD
