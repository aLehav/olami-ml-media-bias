The Baseball Writers Association of America unveiled the  Baseball Hall of Fame class a little over a month ago and four stellar players were inducted into baseball immortality by ballot voting with two additional legends elected by the Modern Baseball Era Committee PERIOD



Suspected performanceenhancing drug PED users Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens only gained about three percent of the votes from  placing them both at just above  percent of the ballots PERIOD

With this induction the inevitable steroid debate rose again reigniting the conversation among millions of sports fanatics PERIOD In a nutshell the debate centers around whether or not players accused of or confirmed to have used PEDs should be allowed into the Hall of Fame PERIOD

As a baseball fan and a student of the games history I have always considered the use of PEDs and steroids to be detrimental to baseballs purity and a mark that taints its legacy and sportsmanship PERIOD No player who either used PEDs or who is under a great suspicion of doing so during the infamous Steroid Era should be voted into the Hall of Fame PERIOD For this analysis I will primarily spotlight batting as this is the chief telling factor of the era PERIOD

In a 15season span between  and  the number of 40homer players a number considered to be the upper echelon of that statistic in a season as well as the highest number of home runs hit by an individual player skyrocketed PERIOD These seasons also approximately represent Barry Bonds peak years when considering batting PERIOD  gave way to only one 42homer individual Jose Canseco who later publicly admitted his use of steroids PERIOD MLB implemented a steroid ban in  but few players acknowledged this warning until power hitting began to take flight later in the decade PERIOD

A sixseason stretch beginning in  and ending in  proves to be the eras harbinger of controversy PERIOD An average of nearly  players surpassed  home runs per year in that span with the highest total averaging over  home runs per season PERIOD The latter years of the decade brought the Sammy SosaMark McGwire home run race of  a contest that captivated the nation as the two National League sluggers traded outofthepark bombs throughout the season PERIOD

This cluster of seasons also brought about Barry Bonds 73homerun campaign in  a record that has never been surpassed PERIOD Bonds is the poster child for the steroid era a solid hitter and fielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates PERIOD He came under scrutiny for PED use as his career continued and skyrocketed in San Francisco PERIOD His meteoric rise in home runs led to speculation that the statistical boost was artificially influenced PERIOD The San Francisco Giant also surpassed Hank Aarons alltime home run record of  in  cementing him as likely one of the most prominent and controversial figures in the sport PERIOD

Although Bonds was never confirmed to have enabled the use of these drugs he was indicted for perjury in the BALCO case PERIOD This investigation into a laboratory that supplied PEDs to athletes produced few prominent names but their supplication of steroids to players was enough for the baseball world to scrutinize Bonds PERIOD

I tend to side with the large portion of the baseball community that believes Bonds used steroids to aid his career PERIOD Stepping back and even simply comparing two photos supports that widely accepted theory as two photos  years apart feature staggering differences even without statistics PERIOD A  photo features a thin agile player who appears to be able to play any fielding position PERIOD However a  picture displays an abnormally bulky hulk of a player who only looks fit to be a designated hitter PERIOD The statistics of Bonds career follow the same pattern peaking in the years that he began to exhibit these signs PERIOD

A large amount of credit should be given to MLB for attempting to control this problem as the organization unsuccessfully attempted to implement an allencompassing program for violators of the drug policy PERIOD This policy went into effect in  and provides three levels of penalties for positive steroid test results with an 80game ban assigned to those penalized for the first time PERIOD Secondtime offenders receive a 162game suspension the entire season and players who test positive for steroids a third time are hit with a lifetime ban PERIOD

Over  players on majorleague rosters have been penalized through this program as of  with only Mets pitcher Jenrry Meja who violated the policy three times in the span of about  months receiving a lifetime ban PERIOD Other prominent players disciplined include Alex Rodriguez Manny Ramirez Rafael Palmeiro Ryan Braun and Miguel Tejada but very few of those penalized became repeat offenders PERIOD

Regarding the Hall of Fame membership of this elite class of legends should be based on natural ability alone PERIOD If there is substantial evidence or suspicion that indicates a player artificially enhanced his performance their chances at an induction to Cooperstown should be waived PERIOD

Becoming a part of baseball immortality requires a devotion to the sport and a myriad of abilities PERIOD These athletes worked their way up through the ranks of the minor leagues to attain their position on a major league team PERIOD Given they record a stellar career and prove themselves to be one of the best at what they do through natural ability they should be rewarded with a chance to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame PERIOD
