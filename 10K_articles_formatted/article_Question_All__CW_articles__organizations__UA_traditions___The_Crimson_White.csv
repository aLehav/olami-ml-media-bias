Friends Alabamians Countrymen better than plainsmen lend me your eyes PERIOD

I come to address concerns not to bury them

The good that HCA does grows as HCA grows

The success of HCA is rooted in its bones

So let HCA continue to thrive The noble Vaughn

Hath told you HCA could  intrude on  other organizations. if it is so why has HCA partnered with many varying organizations

And happily did these organizations and HCA join forces

Here under leave of Vaughn and the CW

For Vaughn is a knowledgeable man

So are they all all knowledgeable men

Come I to rebut Vaughns article

HCA members have become my friends faithful and just to me

But Vaughn says HCA has the appearance of exclusiveness

And Vaughn is a knowledgeable man

HCA hath brought over  students home to the Honors College

Whose schedules did HCA fill PERIOD

Did this in HCA seem exclusive

When disillusioned students cry HCA offers new involvement opportunities

Exclusiveness should be made of more exclusive stuff PERIOD

Yet Vaughn says HCA seems exclusive

And Vaughn is a knowledgeable man PERIOD

You all may have seen that in block seating

HCA has never turned a student away

And HCA gives students an avenue to accomplish all they please

Can this be perceived as exclusion

Yet Vaughn says HCA has no definite path

And sure he is a knowledgeable man PERIOD

I speak not to discourage criticism such as what Vaughn wrote

But here I am to encourage criticism and questions PERIOD

This University needs more questioning not without cause

What cause does not deserve questioning

From established University traditions to new ideas

All need to be founded on reason Bear with me

My heart is tied to this University

And we should all pause and not follow blindly PERIOD","Question All: CW articles, organizations, UA traditions â€“ The Crimson White",University of Alabama
