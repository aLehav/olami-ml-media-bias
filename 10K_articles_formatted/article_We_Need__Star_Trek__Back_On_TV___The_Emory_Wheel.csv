Several weeks ago on Feb PERIOD  we lost Leonard Nimoy best known for his role as Spock ofthe Star Trek franchise PERIOD

Nimoy had a complex relationship with his iconic character PERIOD In  he published the book I Am Not Spock and then later retractedsaid statement as his relationship with his beloved conflicted halfVulcan halfhuman alter ego changed over time PERIOD

Whether it is Spock or Nimoy whom we remember we look back on a man of honor who changed television PERIOD He also changed the way in which we think about one another with his important role in 1960s allegorical storytelling and its impact on societys acceptance of current events and issues such as civil rights PERIOD But much like he did on screen when both were alive Nimoy is arguing with the late DeForest Kelley now PERIOD

That Nimoys acting career became consumed by the bowl cut and devil ears that he first donned in  might explain why when we look back at his contributions to society we think of Nimoys Star Trek reel rather than say production stills from his stage run as dArtagnan in The Three Musketeers or even his unusual but memorable rendition of The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins on his second novelty musical album Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy PERIOD

However that when fans reminisce about Spock they remember his campy television work rather than his films is not just a matter of footage PERIOD Spock and all things Star Trek may explore the big screen from time to time but the franchises real final frontier is and always will be the small screen PERIOD Since  eleven Star Trek movies most recently director J PERIOD J PERIOD Abrams shiny original crew reboots have proved that Star Trek can dazzle on the big screen PERIOD But creator Gene Roddenberrys legacy is not a 120minute action movie but a halfhour ethical what would you do parable with legendary archetypal characters coming to you on your couch every week to enlighten your mind PERIOD

With the exception of Spocks moving death scene in 1982s Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan Spocks complexity through torture criticism and an underlying sense of camaraderie and brotherhood in spite of said traits only really comes across on television PERIOD All of his best moments and for that matter those of every character of any Star Trek cast have been on television telling intellectual stories and using the fantastical veneer of the space western genre to smuggle ethical questions and lofty egalitarian hopes past our prejudices and preconceived notions of race gender and nationality PERIOD

Star Trek The Original Series and Star Trek The Next Generation will forever stand as icons of television  the subtlety definitely dropped off in a big way in the projects made after Roddenberrys passing sion and of progressive thought.And then theres also the Star Trek films and also programs Deep Space Nine and Voyager. and of course the often overlooked Star Trek The Animated Series. and that other one that we dont talk about PERIOD But I digress PERIOD



Star Trek in its original television run held our hand through feminism the Civil Rights movement and the politics of the ColdWar then later returned for the fall of the Berlin Wall and wars in the Middle East and so much more PERIOD But we havent had a Star Trek television program on air since  and we havent had a real Star Trek television program with regard to continuity and canon since  PERIOD This is unacceptable PERIOD

We are in the year  the internet age has made information more readily available to more people than ever before issues of freedom of expression and religious fundamentalist terrorism continue to pervade and some of us have started not only rethinking the way we perceive sexual orientation but also the way we navigate the confusing waters of gender identity PERIOD If there were ever a time for a topical allegorical serial with a disarmingly shiny premise to help us adapt to a confusing new world it would be now PERIOD

Recent rumors speak of a new Star Trek television show in the works with a premise controversial to many fans PERIOD It is tentatively titled Federation. but theres a new rumor of an up and coming Star Trek television return every year PERIOD By the Great Bird of the Galaxy we need something more substantial

Other programs especially those of the always cuttingedge science fiction and fantasy genre have attempted to fill the gaping void that is our dearth of new Star Trek episodes PERIOD Unfortunately Torchwood tried too hard and came off as too pushy the everexpanding Star Wars franchise has consistently fallen short of standing for anything and dont even get me started on the clumsy unfollowable mess of the unplannedpregnancy allegory Kill the Moon in the most recent series of Doctor Who. the only serial of recent years that holds water is the online fan series Star Trek Continues which is modeled after the original PERIOD Simply put we need small screen Star Trek maybe now more than ever PERIOD Actor Zachary Quinto and his peers do an excellent job of keeping the original characters alive Spock Bones Kirk Scotty Uhura Sulu and Chekov and the whole Constitutionclass crew live on in the new movies PERIOD

However the true essence not just of Spock but of the entire franchise cannot fulfill its purpose in summer blockbusters alone it mandates a regular time slot on network television the way Rod intended it so we as a nation can sit back and think PERIOD
