Thats basically where it all started  with a refurbished Keurig said Hannah Roth a junior animal and nutritional science student and president of the First Baptist Church Ministry PERIOD

The it shes referencing is the free weekly Coffee House event with live music that FBC kicks off tomorrow night on the third floor of the church PERIOD This weeks featured artist will be Steve Smith a recently signed artist to West Virginia Universitys independent record label Mon Hill Records PERIOD

Roth said one night she was in that lounge sipping coffee from that refurbished Keurig machine with her fellow group members and they thought it would be a neat idea to do this for the community PERIOD

Every Thursday from   p.m. the community is invited for free coffee refreshments and live music on the third floor of FBC PERIOD

I thought that it wouldve been a cool thing to go chill out and have a cup of coffee or two...rather than go back to my dorm room Roth said PERIOD This is a neat opportunity for students to just chill out. whether they just sit and listen play checkers do homework or chat with friends we want it to be a place to relax and unwind said Kimberly Aurelio the Youth Adult coordinator for FBC PERIOD

The setup of the newly refurbished lounge caters to lounging and intimate group settings with a plethora of couches a ping pong table a kitchen and a small stage PERIOD

If it brings students to church thats great but thats not the goal Roth said PERIOD Its not to bring people to the church or the group PERIOD Its there to help students. its right there too PERIOD The FBC is located off High Street and can literally see WVU from its office PERIOD

Its also an opportunity for the community to get to know the people at First Baptist Church Aurelio said PERIOD

And that community is the one FBC loves PERIOD

The whole reason were doing this is because were a church in the city with a heart for the city Roth said PERIOD We want to be that heart with the students and be there in any capacity they need and we felt the best way to do that is through a coffee house. one guy that also has a heart for WVU and its community is Steve Smith the featured musician for the night PERIOD

According to Aurelio Steve Smith Band played a benefit concert to raise money for a Sigma Nu brother Jordan DeMaske PERIOD Aurelio met Steve and his wife and they love the WVU community PERIOD

It seemed only fitting to invite Steve back to open the first Upper Room Ministries RM Coffee House Aurelio said PERIOD

As for the future lineup of musicians David Wells a Grammynominated artist plays next week PERIOD After that the invitation is open to all musicians PERIOD

We are looking for all types of talent  whether groups or solo artists jazz country classical fusion instrumental or vocal etc. aurelio said PERIOD
