Rampaging dreadfuls blackmasked ninjas and cannibals oh my These are just some of the horrific wonders that await you in Steve Hockensmiths recent work Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Dreadfully Ever After the most recent installment in the wellknown trilogy based on the works of Jane Austen PERIOD Theres something for everyone in this Victorian monsterromance hybrid trilogy romance for the hopelessly in love and guts and bowels for the sane individuals PERIOD

Hockensmith an entertainment reporter turned novelist is an awardwinning author whose short fiction can be found in Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine the Sherlock Homes in America anthology among other publications PERIOD With his most recent work the author establishes himself as a talented satirist PERIOD

Dreadfully Ever After is the third and final novel in the Austen monstermashup series PERIOD After Seth GrahameSmiths New York Times bestselling novel hypnotized audiences Philadelphiabased publishing house Quirk Books released a prequel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Dawn of the Dreadfuls PERIOD

The final installment picks up soon after Darcy and Elizabeths wedding PERIOD The work continues on with an engaging mix of comedy gore and Victorian pretension initially developed in the mashup of Jane Austens work and horror pioneered in GrahameSmiths novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies PERIOD

The third installment of the monstermashup trilogy revolves around martial art and swordwielding gurus Elizabeth Bennet and Mr PERIOD Darcy defending their village against an army of zombies often referred to as unmentionables or dreadful in the assumed tongue of the times PERIOD Things take a turn for the worst for our intrepid master zombie beheaders after Mr PERIOD Darcy is bit by an unmentionable leaving Elizabeth with the difficult decision of chopping off her husbands head and burning his body or letting him turn into one of the undead PERIOD

Not exactly your typical firstfewyearsofmarriage issues that most newlyweds have to deal with PERIOD However the situation brightens as Lizzy soon learns of a cure being created in London that has the potential to save her beloved from living an eternal life as a rotting shambling husk of his former self PERIOD

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Dreadfully Ever After contains more descriptions of the killing of zombies and the overall invasion of the dreadfuls than GrahameSmiths Pride and Prejudice and Zombies which is more than likely due to the fact that the first installment involved inserting zombie scenes throughout Austens original work whereas Hockensmith had to write a complete original Victorian work clad with zombies PERIOD

For example when describing a particular scene about a handspringing ninja Hockensmith inserts his lengthy descriptions At the apex of his flight he pulled a katana from a backscabbard hidden beneath his cutaway coat and as he fell back to earth the blade bit into the dreadfuls head. this gives the work a freer flow while maintaining the irony the first was known for PERIOD

Scattered throughout the novel are  illustrations of events happening in the book ranging from the maiming of zombies with the feisty caption She sent the top of the parasol spinning through the air to remove as many limbs as it might to a romantic embrace and liplock with the gruesome caption below typical for these monster mashups It was heaveneven if she was standing in the spilled innards of a disemboweled dreadful. the tension between these two tones makes Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Dreadfully Ever After a wonderful read PERIOD To see a trailer for the book check out QuirkClassics.com PERIOD
