Theres nothing wrong with Valentines Day PERIOD

If you ask people who hate Feb PERIOD  they come up with several reasons why they cant stand it but I havent heard any that I really buy PERIOD

One of the main gripes about Valentines Day is that its so commercialized PERIOD

I agree  but so what Our economy needs a boost and chocolatiers need to feed their families just as much as anyone PERIOD Plus no one is making you buy anything PERIOD You could just as easily make or do something for your significant other PERIOD

Some say its just for girls PERIOD Although I think thats a rather limited view point I dont totally disagree with it either PERIOD

But how often do you hear guys complain that girls dont just say what we want On Valentines Day its pretty much spelled out for you PERIOD Give her something or do something for her PERIOD Its not that hard PERIOD

Others say it makes single people feel excluded PERIOD

Why Go ahead and celebrate No ones stopping singles from participating PERIOD The origin or reason of St PERIOD Patricks Day doesnt stop millions of people who arent celebrating the arrival of Christianity in Ireland from getting drunk on green beer each March PERIOD

Go out with friends or give yourself a little love  Get yourself some candy take yourself out to eat do whatever you want PERIOD

And try to consider the other side of the coin Commercialized or not superficial or not Valentines Day serves its purpose PERIOD

As someone in a longterm relationship I know that its incredibly easy to push the romance thing to the back burner PERIOD Something always gets in the way PERIOD Bills need paid the house needs cleaning and we have jobs and responsibilities PERIOD

But Valentines is one of the few nights where its socially acceptable to blow off other people and issues to spend time with your lover PERIOD

Red and pink hearts strewn about give us a notsosubtle reminder to slow down and consider the people we love and how we can show them that we love them PERIOD Even better than a reminder it gives us an excuse to heat things up a bit while bringing some much needed couples time into the mix PERIOD

So if you hate Valentines Day heres my advice  get over it PERIOD

The rather sparse decorations around the ESU campus will be down in a few days heartshaped boxes of chocolate will be on sale couples will go back to trying to find a few hours in the week to see each other and you can find something else to be bitter about PERIOD
