Drawing on a study of congregations in rural Mississippi sociologist John Bartkowski of Mississippi State University and Helen A PERIOD Regis cultural anthropologist at Louisiana State University and former MSU professor have evaluated the pros and cons of faithbased welfare reform PERIOD

In their book  Bartkowski and Regis examine the difficulties Mississippians as well as others in America have had in drawing broadbrushed conclusions about faithbased initiatives designed to relieve poverty PERIOD Recently published by New York University Press the 200page book is among the first to look squarely at the role of race in faithbased government initiatives PERIOD

The book an ethnographic study of faithbased poverty relief in  congregations in the rural South draws on indepth interviews and fieldwork in Mississippi faith communities examining how religious conviction and racial dynamics shape congregational benevolence PERIOD

The volume examines how congregations are coping with national developments in social welfare policy and reveals the strategies that religious communities utilize to fight poverty in their local communities PERIOD Through this the book identifies both the prospects and pitfalls likely to result from the expansion of charitable choice PERIOD

While attending the University of Texas as a graduate student in sociology Bartkowski heard a talk given by Marvin Olasky author of  who said that faith communities could provide welfare services much more effectively than the government PERIOD Not wholly convinced by Olaskys argument Bartkowski decided along with Regis to investigate what congregations were doing to alleviate poverty after moving to Mississippi the first state to implement a faithbased welfare reform initiative PERIOD

Their studies led to the subject of charitable choice which is based on a provision in a  welfare reform law called the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act PERIOD Charitable choice forbids the government from discriminating against faithbased providers of social services on the basis of religion now in essence prohibiting states from excluding faithbased organizations when contracting with local service nonprofits in the competitive bidding process PERIOD

 assumes that religious organizations are able to compete on a level playing field with other nongovernmental providers for government funding for social services and aid programs and that inequities between faithbased and secular providers can easily be corrected PERIOD Bartkowski and Regis research illustrates how complex issuesincluding the fact that nongovernmental providers have years of legsup experiencemake this assumption problematic PERIOD

Bartkowski maintains that there are pros and cons to charitable choice PERIOD One advantage of the program he states is that 

However Barkowski and Regis research also points out disadvantages in the program concerning possible problems with implementation PERIOD From this research Bartkowski maintains that unless faithbased organizations are taught how to compete for government money with other providers both religious and secular they are unlikely to find government funds that they may need PERIOD
