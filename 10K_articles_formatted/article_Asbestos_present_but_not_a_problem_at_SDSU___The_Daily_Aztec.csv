Meet the District  supervisor candidate Amy Reichert

Cigarette smoke radiation sunburn or a fatty diet can cause cancer but can San Diego State University The asbestos used in many buildings at SDSU can but because of stringent management and regulation it probably wont PERIOD

Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that has been used since ancient times because it doesnt burn and is a poor conductor of heat and electricity PERIOD For decades it was used widely in building construction PERIOD

Asbestos has been found to cause asbestosis a scarring of the lungs which impedes proper breathing and can cause lung cancer and mesothelioma a cancer of the lining of the chest or abdominal wall PERIOD

Since  its use has been restricted and regulated by the federal government and employers are now required by California Health and Safety Codes to notify all employees of the locations of asbestos in buildings PERIOD

The university is not required to disclose asbestos locations to students and it doesnt PERIOD SDSU does however notify the Associated Students Council which can disseminate the information through its college representatives PERIOD

Brandon Slavik an accounting junior had no idea that asbestos was on campus PERIOD

It makes me a little uncomfortable knowing asbestos is more present than I ever knew  but Im pretty secure that SDSU is looking out for us he said PERIOD

The estimated cost of asbestos management removal or other abatement for fiscal year  was  said Veronica Hoban SDSU asbestos coordinator PERIOD

Some of the more commonly encountered building materials on campus that might contain asbestos include pipe insulation sprayon fireproofing acoustic ceiling treatments ceiling panels and tiles sheet flooring and floor tiles she said PERIOD

According to an asbestos notification sent to all SDSU employees by Director of Environmental Health and Safety M.C PERIOD Hull all 9inch square floor tiles throughout the entire campus are likely to contain asbestos PERIOD

Benchtops sinks and chalkboards in ChemistryGeology acoustic sprayon ceilings on the second floor of Love Library the rough ceiling in Montys Den and kitchen and waterpipe insulation in Zapotec and Zura halls are all known to contain asbestos as well as various materials in  other SDSU facilities PERIOD

Despite the wide use of asbestos at SDSU students and faculty have nothing to fear according to Hoban PERIOD It is only dangerous when its fibers are released into the air and are inhaled PERIOD

Asbestoscontaining material is safe when it is used for its intended purpose and is undisturbed by either human or environmental factors she said PERIOD

However as ACM deteriorates or becomes damaged the potential for asbestos fibers to be released increases. asbestos is not dangerous to the touch but because disturbing asbestoscontaining material can easily release fibers into the air Hull advised employees in his memorandum to avoid touching asbestos materials on walls ceilings pipes or in equipment. environmental Health and Safety works with the SDSU Physical Plant to make sure materials containing asbestos are in good condition throughout the campus PERIOD

Through a program of identification regular surveillance and routine maintenance of ACM we strive to minimize the sources of potential damage or deterioration of ACM that could lead to asbestos fiber release Hoban said PERIOD

To the best of our knowledge no one has ever developed an asbestosrelated disease because of exposure to ACM on campus. some areas on campus such as mechanical rooms are offlimits to students and employees because of the presence of asbestos PERIOD These areas are limited only to personnel with proper training and equipment PERIOD

We limit access to these areas not because dangerous circumstances exist in these areas but because an inadequately trained person could cause dangerous circumstances to develop Hoban said PERIOD

SDSU has removed or abated significant amounts of asbestoscontaining material she said and it dedicates significant funding personnel and training to maintaining ACM safely until the time comes to remove it PERIOD

Any damaged materials that may contain asbestos should be immediately reported to Environmental Health and Safety at  PERIOD
