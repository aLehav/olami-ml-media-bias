Milwaukee is filled to the brim with interesting restaurants unique pubsand of course delicious coffee shops PERIOD Anyone who gets mochas or lattes on a regular basis has a different location that he or sheprefers whether for the food and drink served or the atmosphere PERIOD

I appreciate how close Starbucks is to my apartment Dylan Maslowski a junior in the College of Arts  Sciencessaid.Its probably my favorite place on campus to study and I always try something new from the menu every time I come here. theWisconsin Avenue Starbucks situated between McCormick Hall and the McCabe apartment building and is frequented by many on the western side of the campus PERIOD

I come here with my roommates to chill and sometimes I come just to read a book or do homework Maslowski said PERIOD

The coffee house features a fireplace couches and chairs as well as ample charging ports to accommodate students looking for a place to relax and study PERIOD

Other Milwaukee locals prefer other commercial caffeine hubs PERIOD Ariana Stein sometimes stops by Dunkin Donuts on her war to work at Miller Time Pub PERIOD She said that Dunkin Donuts is a more costeffective option PERIOD

I used to go to the Starbucks down the street but it was a little pricy for me Stein said PERIOD

However Stein has no issue preparing her own cup of joe from the comfort of her home PERIOD

Usually I just make Dunkin Donuts coffee at home but when I wake up late I stop by to grab myself breakfast Stein said PERIOD

Similarly students across campus have found benefits from brewing their own coffee PERIOD Some have chosen to invest in a Keurig PERIOD

The reason a Keurig is nice is because its so convenient and you can have your coffee quick and relatively cheap versus going to Starbucks Kristen Leonard a sophomore in the College of Communication said PERIOD

Keurigs also offer the option of a variety of flavors and brands PERIOD Leonard often drinks Caribou Coffee PERIOD She uses her machine every day PERIOD

While some students are dependent on drinking coffee on a regular basis many students solely depend on caffeine during stressful times such as finals week PERIOD Baristas agreed that there are a surplus of customers during exam season PERIOD

Some studentsfind it hard to choose any specific coffee house PERIOD Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses and different atmospheres and flavors are difficult to choose between.Regardless of which one a person may prefer coffee shops and study spotsare a vital part of the college experience PERIOD
