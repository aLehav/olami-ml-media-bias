Christopher Padilla a senior majoring in Mechanical Engineering mentioned though he is vaccinated the sweepstakes would not be a strong incentive to get the vaccine PERIOD

The sweepstakes only give  people achanceat winning a prize PERIOD Although that may be great for someone who supports getting the vaccine I dont think those who have yet to be vaccinated are willing to get the shot just for achanceat one of three prizes said Padilla PERIOD Those who support vaccinating themselves likely have already gotten the shot and those who are on the fence about itarelikely getting itonlyso they dont have to do mandatory COVID19 tests every week. padilla said a better incentive would be money given to the students liketheNM  Vaccine Incentive or a tuition deduction PERIOD

This way you areguaranteedsomething whether it be   or something off your tuition Padilla said PERIOD

Other students raised the similar concerns when it came to the sweepstakes PERIOD

An unvaccinatedstudent from the College of Health Education and Social Transformation said they understand the incentive of prizes but for them the reward is low PERIOD

I understand that giving prizes as an incentive may seem enticing to some students but other students may not be able to get the vaccine due to medical or religious reasons the student said PERIOD Or they may just not believe in vaccinations PERIOD I dont think the sweepstakes are enough of an incentive for college students to be vaccinated unless they were already going to do it. the incentive program is open until Sept PERIOD  at 6p.m.students and staff can enteronline PERIOD
