The University of Cincinnati mens basketball program was rated No PERIOD  in the nation by the Associated Press in a list of the best basketball programs of alltime PERIOD

While the Bearcats have been to just one Sweet  since  their history of two national championships and six Final Four appearances were enough to warrant status among basketball bluebloods such as Kentucky and North Carolina PERIOD

For some fans this ranking came as no surprise as they believe the history of UC basketball is inline with the other great programs PERIOD

When you look at what we accomplished when Oscar Robertson and Bob Huggins were there we deserve to be looked at as one of the nations best said firstyear UC student Dylan Johnson PERIOD How many other schools can boast that they won backtoback national championships We have had periods where we were not at the top but so has every other program PERIOD For the most part I feel like UC is consistently in the top25 every year and not many programs can say that. thirdyear student Branden Herman shared the sentiment that backtoback championships alone warranted the status of UC in the top  PERIOD

We were the best team in the nation two years in a row and finished in second the year after that Herman said PERIOD Other than UCLA when they had John Wooden I cant think of any other teams who went to the national championship three straight years PERIOD We have had a lot of good seasons since then as well but honestly that by itself is enough for any program to be considered in the top10. others were a bit surprised at the notion that a midmajor school regardless of the success that they have enjoyed would be recognized as one of the nations dominant programs PERIOD

When you look at how the NCAA looks down on us I am shocked at the fact that we were ranked No PERIOD  of alltime programs said thirdyear student Dylan Hart PERIOD I mean look at this year PERIOD We lost four games all season and we got a sixseed in the NCAA Tournament because the NCAA thought our competition was trash PERIOD They never give any credit to teams that are not in the ACC or Big  so I cant believe they actually recognized us this time. firstyear student Joe Friedel was also surprised that a midmajor program was given this kind of recognition PERIOD

When you look at a lot of the nonpower five conference teams that have had success in the past they never get any credit Friedel said PERIOD Even when teams like Gonzaga or Wichita State have historic seasons where they lose one game the entire year everybody always says they are overrated because they did not play anybody PERIOD UC only had one brief experience with what the NCAA considers topnotch competition when they played in the Big East so to be considered a topprogram despite that is really impressive. a lot of what went into the rankings were the programs success in the AP top25 polls PERIOD

Cincinnati has appeared in over  percent of all AP polls and has been ranked No PERIOD   times PERIOD

The nine teams ranked above UC were Kentucky North Carolina Duke UCLA Kansas Indiana Louisville Arizona and Syracuse PERIOD
