With approximately  of ballots counted Gov PERIOD Gavin Newsom will remain in Californias governors mansion according to the Associated Press PERIOD

Newsom beat the recall handily with nearly  of voters preferring he stay in office to finish his term PERIOD

In Sonoma County District Attorney Jill Ravitch also survived a recall PERIOD More than  of voters listened to her campaigns pleas to reject revenge and keep her as DA PERIOD
