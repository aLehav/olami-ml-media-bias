Alexandra Lowery  Monday February  

Sunday night marked the end of 2015s award show season with the 87thAnnual Academy Awards an evening that left America surprised inspired and a little uncomfortable PERIOD

Neil Patrick Harris fourtime host of the Tonys and twotime Emmy master of ceremonies found himself on primetime yet again taking on the Oscars for the first time in his career PERIOD Opening with a politically charged pun  tonight we honor todays best and whitest  sorry brightest  Harris set the tone for what would be a socially conscious awards ceremony  very  PERIOD The host quickly followed with a glossy Broadwayesque musical number about the magic of the movies  if you were expecting anything else from Neil then shame on you honestly PERIOD

The first two winners in the supporting actor categories came as no surprise to anyone  J.K PERIOD Simmons won for his ferocious performance in Whiplash and Patricia Arquette for her twelve years of hard work on Boyhood. their speeches similarly did not disappoint  Simmons practically read a love letter to his wife and reminded everyone to call their parents while Arquette delivered an empowered call for the reconciliation of the wage gap amongst men and women in the United States PERIOD The demand was met by raucous applause from most of the women in the audience and even elicited what looked a lot like fist bumping from nineteentime nominee Meryl Streep PERIOD

The evenings musical performances were for the most part emotionally driven  apart from the enthusiastic rendition of The Lego Movies original song Everything Is Awesome in which Oprah was presented with a glorious Lego Oscar PERIOD Lady Gaga stunned everyone with an amazing tribute for the 50thanniversary of The Sound of Music. the showstopper of the ceremony however was Glory the protest anthem composed by Lonnie Lynn Common and John Stephens John Legend for Selma which brought the crowd to its feet and tears to the eyes of several of its audience members PERIOD The record shortly thereafter won the Oscar for Best Original Song prompting the songwriting duo to deliver another noteworthy speech Legend pronouncing Selma is now. unable to neglect the arguably most gifed moment from last years Academy Awards NPH joked Benedict Cumberbatch Its not only the most awesome name in show business its also the sound you get when you ask John Travolta to pronounce Ben Affleck in reference to Travoltas embarrassingly unascertainable attempt to say Idina Menzels name at the Oscars in  PERIOD Travolta and Menzel both appeared on stage the two musical stars trying and failing to shed a funny light on last years mishap when Travolta made Menzel and the . million other people watching extremely uncomfortable by touching her face repeatedly effectively giving the Internet enough Travolta ammo to last them until next years Oscars PERIOD

Graham Moore screenwriter for The Imitation Game accepted his Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay with the final moving speech of the night about his struggle with suicide when he was sixteen telling all the young kids watching that feel like they dont fit in anywhere to stay weird and stay different. the last of the acting categories were wrapped up with two predicted yet welldeserved wins as Eddie Redmayne adorably accepted his Best Actor Oscar for playing genius Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything and Julianne Moore classily won Best Actress for her painful portrayal of a woman diagnosed with Alzheimers disease in Still Alice her third big win for the role this awards season PERIOD

For the shows finale the winner of Best Picture was announced to a somewhat surprised audience as Birdman took home the golden statue despite Boyhood being the obvious favorite for the award PERIOD

Sean Penn however caused most of the buzz on social media as the presenter of the final award decided it was a good idea to wonder aloud who gave this sonofab a green card before awarding Mexicanborn director of the winning film and winner of Best Director ealier in the night Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu with the Oscar PERIOD Penn was met with backlash on Twitter many taking the comment as confirmation of the previously trending OscarsSoWhite in reference to the lack of diversity and absence of Selma recognitions amongst the Oscar nominees PERIOD
