The photo booth has whiteboards that say not on my campus on the bottom PERIOD Everyone is invited to write on the whiteboard what they do not want to see on UNLs campus to promote awareness for violence sexual assault racism and more according to Pat Tetreault director of the LGBTQA and Womens centers PERIOD

We wanted to give our campus community an opportunity to share their voice about what they do not want to see on their campus Wilkerson said PERIOD

According to Wilkerson participants said they do not want to see racism hate sexual violence and stalking on campus and the photo booth sparked new discussions on hate violence and more PERIOD Tetreault said the booth is a stepping stone for people to figure out what they want to see on campus PERIOD

I think whats more important than the photos is the conversations Wilkerson said PERIOD I think we had some great conversations with people PERIOD Some who said You know I really need to think about what I want to say. wilkerson said CARE is posting the photos on social media and may use the photos in the future to help continue raising awareness PERIOD

It will really just give us a sense of feedback from our campus community Wilkerson said PERIOD What are people concerned about and what are areas we can look at addressing and banding together on. the photo booth is only one of the events at UNL that are part of the Week Without Violence PERIOD Tetreault said the Womens Center and Vision Maker Media showed a documentary called Blood Memory on Monday which is about the history of the Indian Child Welfare Act and the Ethics Center hosted a Brown Bag Luncheon on peace and peacemaking on Wednesday PERIOD

Wilkerson said she hopes students and others stop by to use their voice through the photo booth PERIOD

You dont have to be the only voice she said PERIOD  There are other people out there that are potentially likeminded and maybe theres a way for you to get involved. newsdailynebraskan.com
