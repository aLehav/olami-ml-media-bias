Immigrants are getting an improved quality of life today than they were a few years ago PERIOD



As one of the most infrastructurally and economically developed countries in the world the United States of America is a land of tremendous opportunity PERIOD Looking at the history of the nation it has always attracted immigrants who travel to the United States to fulfill their American dream PERIOD Being one of them I have come to realize that my life as an immigrant is a lot better today than what others experienced even  years ago PERIOD



Truthfully life as an immigrant is never easy PERIOD They arrive on foreign land are often not fluent in the local language and are often unfamiliar with its culture PERIOD On top of that they also have to deal with xenophobia and racism PERIOD Be it their accent or appearance immigrants are often easy targets for marginalization PERIOD In turn these factors may cause immigrants to suffer from lack of employment opportunities PERIOD



Not too long ago immigrants who may not be perceived as Caucasian were treated poorly in the States PERIOD I have heard from my Nepali compatriots who arrived in the United States a decade ago that discrimination was very prevalent PERIOD Gas station owners would not give them jobs and even professors in college would treat them unfairly PERIOD Local Americans would not want to befriend them which limited them to their circle of Nepali connections PERIOD



But now times are changing PERIOD It is not as difficult to be an immigrant in the United States as it was a decade ago PERIOD Minorities have found a way to come together in their common experiences PERIOD I have come to realize this in recent days after finding myself sharing a dorm room with my African friend PERIOD Whenever we feel lonely in our present circumstances we try to comfort each other with our words and dispel the gloom of feeling alienated PERIOD I feel as though America at the end of the day has always been a country made up of people who despite their nationalities came together to make their dreams come true PERIOD



Especially due to the COVID19 pandemic particularly for immigrants people have begun to come closer together than ever before PERIOD Even in an average American I feel that the level of empathy has increased immensely PERIOD Furthermore movements like Black Lives Matter have also had a tremendous impacts on making Americans more aware of oppression and discrimination PERIOD People are getting more cautious about how their actions may leave negative consequences on immigrants and people of color PERIOD



Now it is in the hands of residents of the United States to make things even better not only for local citizens but also immigrants themselves PERIOD
