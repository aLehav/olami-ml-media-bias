Its obvious that student debt is a problem PERIOD The data suggests higher education is better at producing indebted students than it is productive members of the workforce  percent of studentloan holders are in default with total studentloan debt now surpassing total creditcard debt PERIOD With less than half of graduates getting jobs requiring a bachelors degree the efficacy of this debt is questionable PERIOD

This debt can take a toll as we report today in The Pitt News PERIOD It defines our lives now and even more when we reach six months after graduation and bills start coming PERIOD

Since debt is such an integral part of the college experience in the U.S PERIOD today colleges and universities should address this in their marketing PERIOD

Not in some idealistic attempt to do the public a service PERIOD But in a spirited competitive drive for more students and customers PERIOD

This suggestion may seem silly PERIOD No company markets itself for its worst qualities PERIOD Toyota doesnt broadcast its brake failures and Apple doesnt try to market its notoriously ethically murky supply chains PERIOD

But when companies properly market the true authentic experience of a product and show how they differentiate from competitors companies can thrive PERIOD

And since debt is one of the truest most authentic experiences of college living universities should use this as a potential reservoir of consumer resonance PERIOD

You could call it the Applebees approach to college marketing PERIOD

When Applebees CEO Julia Stewart took control of the company in  the company was facing declining revenues and a tarnished reputation PERIOD Applebees was a punching bag representing everything soulcrushing and terrible about monotonous suburban casual dining PERIOD

After closing poorly managed stores Stewart redirected the chains branding to embrace this characterization PERIOD Since customers know Applebees isnt a French bistro or quirky small business the chain embraces its ordinariness and encourages customers to come specifically because of its lowkey appeal through social media and its See You Tomorrow campaign PERIOD Applebees tells customers its the best at what it does providing a good environment to enjoy reasonable food PERIOD

This nonglamorous approach emphasizing the ordinariness of the dining experience could have been viewed as highlighting the negative aspects of the company but the method has led to two years of samestore sales growth PERIOD Telling customers what to expect and showing them how to deliver works PERIOD

The best way to see how this could work is to imagine a theoretical ad campaign highlighting Pitts internship program PERIOD If this program is successful and it does lead to better prospects for Pitt students the University should take the Applebees approach to advertising PERIOD

Remove from advertising materials the picture of beautiful variously ethnic students listening to a professor lecture on a lawn PERIOD In big bold text simply say Debt blows. then on the next page show a young adult at a desk with text underneath saying but Pitt will make it worth it. simple effective and honest PERIOD Pitt could differentiate itself from similarly ranked schools on an emotionally important front such as debt PERIOD Youll be in debt wherever you go but Pitt gives you the tools to manage it PERIOD

The obvious idealistic public service announcement of this is that broadcasting the debt aspects of college more loudly might help slow down the administrative bloat and building arms race that is partially responsible for high tuition in the first place PERIOD Effusive mailers highlighting debt might make an expensive university investing in aquariums and nap pods less appealing PERIOD

Overall Pitt marketing agents could learn from Applebees PERIOD While theyre at it riblets in Market Central wouldnt be a bad idea either PERIOD
