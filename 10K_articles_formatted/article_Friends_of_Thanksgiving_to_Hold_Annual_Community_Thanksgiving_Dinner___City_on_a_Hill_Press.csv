970,2010-11-11,"the Santa Cruz Veterans Hall will be unable to continue its 24year tradition of hosting Santa Cruzs Community Thanksgiving Dinner this year PERIOD The United Veterans Council announced last month that due to the closure of the Veterans Hall it would be unable to host the traditional dinner PERIOD

In response a group of activists from the Santa Cruz community formed Friends of Thanksgiving a broadbased coalition of people who have taken responsibility for carrying on the tradition of the annual Thanksgiving dinner served to the homeless of Santa Cruz PERIOD Former city council candidate Steve Pleich was the driving force behind the groups materialization PERIOD

All these people have made time especially to do this Pleich said PERIOD This group wouldnt have been anything if people hadnt made the commitment to really see this through. friends of Thanksgiving came together only three weeks ago and in that time they organized the alternative Thanksgiving Day event which will be held at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium from  to  p.m PERIOD

The Veterans Hall typically serves over  meals each year for Thanksgiving and Friends of Thanksgiving is prepared for a similar turnout this year PERIOD Pleich said that it is ready to serve about  meals this year maybe more PERIOD

A lot of private individuals have been donating food and many different organizations were willing to contribute said Rev PERIOD Dennis Adams a Friends of Thanksgiving leader PERIOD When we mention to people that this dinner is still going to be going on they are very happy and willing to help out. pleich said main donation sources include the Farmers Market Second Harvest Food Bank and Beckmanns Old World Bakery PERIOD The Homeless Services Center has helped as well and Costco offered special prices on turkey for the event PERIOD Though many businesses are pitching in some food sources will potentially be unavailable due to the initial cancellation PERIOD

Our problem is because we started so late it took a while to work out Pleich said PERIOD Some of the folks that normally donate saw the article in the Sentinel that there would be no Thanksgiving dinner and they made commitments of food that they normally would have given to the Veterans Hall PERIOD Were trying to get a hold of those folks and make sure they havent committed their food to somebody else. nevertheless volunteers have been stepping up to the plate and phones have been ringing off the hook with people interested in donating their time or food to the event said Megan Carlson volunteer coordinator for the Homeless Services Center PERIOD

I dont have any doubt that the community will come together and be a part of this event Carlson said PERIOD Were really excited about it PERIOD Its an event that we all can participate in PERIOD Its for the whole community. former city council candidate Pleich said Santa Cruz has a reputation for being generous and helping those less fortunate and that Friends of Thanksgiving has been counting on that aspect of the community to get this event together PERIOD

This is the Santa Cruz tradition and were going to keep it going in any way we can he said PERIOD There are a lot of people doing really great work PERIOD This is going to help us turn a time of want and need into a time of celebration and generosity. rev PERIOD Adams emphasized the importance of the meal for the homeless in Santa Cruz PERIOD
