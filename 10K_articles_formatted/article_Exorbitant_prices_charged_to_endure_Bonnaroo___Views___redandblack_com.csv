I know right now in the dead of winter its hard to imagine sunlight and the luxury of always being warm but I assure you there are beacons of hope on the horizon PERIOD For some those beacons take on the form of music festivals with Tennessees Bonnaroo being a Southern favorite PERIOD

The lineup for Bonnaroo  is announced before the actual festival prompting hipsters from all over to simultaneously freak out from excitement or to critique the choice of musical acts PERIOD It seems to me whenever a lineup for a music festival is announced my whole Twitter feed feels inclined to offer their input on whether the musicians are talented or not PERIOD It turns out everyone is a music critic with authority on all things hip PERIOD The Grammy proved to be no exception and frankly Im over it PERIOD

First of all no one that I know can afford a . general admission ticket PERIOD And this amount is the lowestpriced ticket available the most expensive being VIP tickets for . per pair PERIOD Anyone who buys said tickets is paying exorbitant amounts to rough it PERIOD When you buy a Bonnaroo ticket you are agreeing to camp out without easily accessible showers PERIOD You are willingly deciding to mingle with other unwashed and smelly people who also chose to shell out hundreds of dollars to do so PERIOD

You cant even look at a music festival lineup without thinking about flower crowns and Bonnaroo is the mecca for blossomloving free spirits PERIOD Its like everyone who attends Bonnaroo wont be let in unless they are fully decked out in hippieesque clothing PERIOD These people are trying so hard to be cool and hipster which strikes me as both sad and ironic PERIOD The urgent need to appear as trendy and stylish as possible marks festivalgoers as more pitiful than anything PERIOD

Maybe I have it all wrong seeing as Ive never actually had the pleasure of attending Bonnaroo but when I see how much of a production it is my desire to go is squashed entirely PERIOD The festival which will take place from June  this year is the number one reason I could never go PERIOD Southern summers are brutal and being exposed to the elements is not something my paleskin is capable of enduring PERIOD

When I call Bonnaroo a production I truly mean it PERIOD Everyone seems to want it to be this cool laidback hangout where everyone just rolls with the punches and goes with the flow PERIOD Its meant to look like a totally relaxed atmosphere but I am not fooled for a second PERIOD There is too much of an appearance and act to keep up preventing it from ever being as freespirited as its supposed to be PERIOD

So if you want to shell out a huge amount of money to dress like a hipster and not shower for a week Bonnaroo seems to be the perfect summer activity PERIOD
