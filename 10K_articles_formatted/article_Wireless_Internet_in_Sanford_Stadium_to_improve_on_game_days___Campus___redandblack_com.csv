Police respond to trespass in Sanford Stadium twice in same week PERIOD

When the University of Georgia football team makes an impressive play fans are often eager to capture and share it on their social networks PERIOD But with  fans in Sanford Stadium on game days many have experienced the frustration of busy or blocked cell phone signals a problem that ATT has attempted to fix PERIOD

ATT announced in a press release Tuesday that it has completed a project that included the installation of more than  new distributed antenna systems in Sanford Stadium through which game attendees will notice increased network coverage PERIOD

We just completed in fact this past Monday an expansion of our instadium system that will basically provide more than four times the Internet capacity of last year for ATT customers in the stadium said Paul Chambers the Northeast Georgia regional director of external affairs for ATT PERIOD

Chambers said a lack of cell coverage has contributed to a decrease in game attendance by students and cited a  percent vacant seat rate among students from  PERIOD

When they started talking to students about some of the reasons why students are not going to the games connectivity on their wireless devices was one of their issues he said PERIOD

As a result ATT added the additional DAS and a large data room under the east end zone bleachers PERIOD Although the company expects the problem to be alleviated Chambers said ATT will continue to monitor the situation as the season progresses PERIOD

Though you can never tell until you get  people in the stands the fan experience this year will be greatly improved not to say it will ever be perfect he said PERIOD

The DAS will be strategically placed throughout the stadium which will provide a better mechanism to handle highcapacity usage in hightraffic areas PERIOD The antennas provide enhanced wireless coverage despite physical limitations and situational inconveniences such as terrain building construction or crowd density PERIOD

The DAS technology functions by decreasing the distance a signal request has to travel thus improving user mobile experience PERIOD

Fans should also be able to expect more reliable calls and consistent access to the ATT network according to the release PERIOD And as ATT has doubled overall network capacity in Athens fans can experience better cell coverage while tailgating outside of the stadium PERIOD

Greg McGarity director of athletics at UGA said in a press release that the enhanced coverage by ATT will address one of fans greatest concerns this season PERIOD
