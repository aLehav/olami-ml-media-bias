Lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people are members of our community PERIOD They are business owners public servants teachers classmates friends and relatives PERIOD They are tax paying citizens and most importantly they are human beings PERIOD California should not do anything that eliminates their rights or the rights of any other Californian PERIOD Proposition  discriminates against gays and lesbians by eliminating their right to marry and instead places them into an entirely separate but equal institution PERIOD This proposition seeks to enshrine discrimination into the very document that is intended to protect rights and promote equality Regardless of how you personally feel about same sex marriage the issue with Proposition  is about how the constitution treats its citizens PERIOD Using the law to eliminate rights from an entire group of people with the claim that those people are less deserving of legal protection is wrong The constitution is framed to protect rights and not take them away PERIOD

It has been  years since Californians passed Proposition  and a lot has changed since then despite what some people may choose to believe PERIOD Californians have seen the inequality inherent to domestic partnerships PERIOD Many people have witnessed and understand how domestic partnerships fail to provide equal treatment to same sex couples PERIOD They do not want the law to treat anyone differently and the courts understood this when they overturned this unconstitutional statute PERIOD

In such an emotional and tense campaign it is easy to be distracted and misled by the hateful false and abhorrent attacks by the proponents of Proposition  PERIOD They lead you to believe that if Prop  fails then churches will lose their tax exemption status and homosexuality will be taught to our children in school PERIOD All of this is completely false and several nonpartisan state agencies have stepped up to counter these deceitful attack ads PERIOD The State Board of Equalization and Attorney General confirm that churches will never lose their tax exemption status over same sex marriage PERIOD The State Superintendent of Public Instruction announced earlier that same sex marriage does not eliminate the right of parents to be involved in their childrens education and parents will always have discretion over the curriculum of their children for any subject PERIOD

If the intolerant Proposition  passes then the constitution will declare that every single gay lesbian bisexual and transgender Californian is less deserving of legal protection PERIOD They will not be permitted the same rights guaranteed to heterosexual Californians PERIOD In the eyes of the law I will have fewer legal rights than my heterosexual twin sister

If we do the right thing and vote no on Proposition  every single Californian will continue to be treated equally by the law PERIOD My rights and the rights of tens of thousands of Californians are in your hands on November  PERIOD Do not eliminate the right to marry for anyone PERIOD Vote no on Prop
