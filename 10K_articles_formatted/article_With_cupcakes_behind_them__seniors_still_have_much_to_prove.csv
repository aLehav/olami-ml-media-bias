One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

Nowadays its all about whats new hip and in style PERIOD We will do anything to look younger and stay fresh on the scene PERIOD

Even in the sports world youth steals the show PERIOD Professional teams are reluctant to trade away young talent PERIOD Lots of attention is paid to players still in high school who experts predict to be the next great soandso PERIOD And of course theres a certain announcer losing his voice every night raving about diaper dandies. but while youth may be the current trend Michigan coach Tommy Amaker is hoping his team has an edge based on its experience PERIOD The Wolverines starting lineup through  games looks like this

Dion Harris PERIOD Senior PERIOD

Lester Abram PERIOD Senior PERIOD

Courtney Sims PERIOD Senior PERIOD

Brent Petway PERIOD Senior PERIOD

Ron Coleman PERIOD Junior PERIOD

Heading into this season Amaker said numerous times his team will go just as far as the seniors take it PERIOD Its a valid statement considering half of Michigans normal rotation consists of seniors PERIOD

Switching to point guard because of the graduation of Daniel Horton Harris leads the team in assists and sports an assisttoturnover ratio of more than  PERIOD

Harris is also second on the team in scoring at . points per game with Sims holding onto a slight edge . pERIOD Petway and Abram are fourth and fifth respectively PERIOD

The rebounding numbers also lend support to the leadership of the seniors PERIOD Petway . rebounds per game and Sims . control the boards for the Wolverines PERIOD

And then theres Michigans record  which suggests Amaker and his crew are in good shape PERIOD But a glance at the schedule illuminates a different image PERIOD None of the Wolverines  wins has been very impressive at least considering the opponent PERIOD They have played some very good games locking down opposing offenses and sharing the ball to find easy buckets PERIOD But its hard to gauge what that production means when it comes against the likes of Wofford Delaware State and Central Connecticut State  teams Michigan is supposed to beat PERIOD

More telling has been how the team and seniors in particular has responded during Michigans toughest situations PERIOD Its easy to focus on the Wolverines lone loss of the season  a  defeat at North Carolina State that wasnt as close as the score indicates  and say the seniors let the team down PERIOD

And youd be right PERIOD After jumping out to an early 12point lead Michigan allowed a Wolfpack team playing without its best player and with just five scholarship players total to go on a  run to put the game out of reach PERIOD Harris shot 4of14 from downtown and committed three turnovers PERIOD Abram chipped in just three points PERIOD Petway and Sims were outrebounded by the Wolfpacks big men PERIOD The Wolverines fought hard down the stretch but shouldnt have needed a furious comeback attempt in the first place PERIOD

Even scarier for Michigan is its road win at Miami Ohio PERIOD Harris was the only senior who played well notching  points PERIOD And the team allowed the RedHawks to trim an 18point lead down to two PERIOD If it wasnt for freshman Ekpe Udoh stepping up with five straight points to spark a  run in the second half the Wolverines probably never would have snapped out of their funk PERIOD Instead of a gritty  win fans would be talking about how Michigan let another chance slip away PERIOD

That has seemingly been the theme for the Michigan basketball program in recent years  something of which this current group of seniors has been a large part PERIOD Theyve almost learned how to lose instead of to win PERIOD

Last season the Wolverines failed to make the NCAA Tournament after starting off  PERIOD Who really knows if this group of seniors can get it done

Maybe the infusion of new blood in Udoh and DeShawn Sims  the prize of the recruiting class whose progress has been slowed due to the loss of his brother  will challenge the seniors for minutes and provide the spark to snap them out of their losing routine as was the case against Miami PERIOD

Or maybe this class is destined to always come up a little short in which case the finger should be pointed at Amaker even more so than the players PERIOD

However its going to work out the challenge starts now PERIOD

No longer will we have to judge whether or not a blowout of a bad team is something worth getting excited about PERIOD

After hosting Northern Illinois Saturday Michigan will fly crosscountry to take on No PERIOD  UCLA on Dec PERIOD  PERIOD A week later the Wolverines host Georgetown  a big name school that started the season ranked No PERIOD  in both the AP and ESPNUSA Today Polls PERIOD Those two games will be looked upon seriously by the Tournament selection committee come March potentially sealing the Wolverines fate either way PERIOD

After that the Big Ten season begins PERIOD And the only way this Michigan team will survive it is if its seniors step up in the biggest moments PERIOD They will get plenty of opportunities PERIOD But as was the case last year the question is Can they finally come through
