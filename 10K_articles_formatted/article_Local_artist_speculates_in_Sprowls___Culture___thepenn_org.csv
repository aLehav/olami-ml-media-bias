Considerable cloudiness PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm























The Kipp Gallery in Sprowls Hall is featuring a new exhibit by localaffiliated artist Naomi J PERIOD Falk titled there from noon to  p.m PERIOD every MondayFriday through Dec PERIOD  PERIOD

While Falk is originally from Michigan she studied and obtained her masters degree from Carnegie Mellon University PERIOD Falk dabbles in a variety of different mediums but her most prominent pieces tend to be sculptural and threedimensional in nature PERIOD

Falk said in her artist statement that her work seeks to force the viewer to ask themselves do fences make good neighbors and is the grass really greener on the other side

She said in her statement that she attempts to do this by exploring built and found landscapes PERIOD I consider how we define home and how we value personal space PERIOD What do we do to protect it

This exhibit takes the first question of do fences make good neighbors quite literally as a metal wire fence structure dominates the majority of the central space of the gallery PERIOD Adorned with bright orange tape the structure gives off a mazelike feel that inspires the viewer to take a walk through and around it PERIOD

While the fence is the largest and most dominant aspect of this exhibit a series of smaller sculptural works and drawings surround the outskirts of the exhibit space and walls PERIOD The use of paint and wood gives a different textual feel and the use of the color orange is in some manner present throughout all of the works in the gallery PERIOD

The use of this color helps to provide a consistent focal point for the viewer that ties the entire exhibit together PERIOD

Falks work certainly achieved her goal of making the viewer ruminate on why we as a society seem to focus so much on creating structures that are meant to keep others out PERIOD

But the openness of the space detracts a bit from the message of how we define personal space PERIOD

Falk said she desires to use her work to force the viewer to contemplate the struggles and connections we have with each other and the need to find a place to call our own. log In
