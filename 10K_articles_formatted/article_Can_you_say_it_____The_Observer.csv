Can you say it Vagina PERIOD

Every year around this time that curiously absent anatomical word floats across campus like a fad a discovery and then disappears into the cave of annual campus events PERIOD However this is the exact opposite of the mission of the Vagina Monologues and VDay PERIOD Talking to Notre Dames diverse group of Vagina Warriors one sees beyond the clouded debate and controversy to find an energizing play a socially vital movement and a beloved community of sisters working for a better world PERIOD

The Vagina Monologues sprang from the depths of the unspoken PERIOD Discussions surrounding female bodies sexuality and rape are deemed either inappropriate for open discussion or unimportant PERIOD We lack spaces for discussion for these issues and for VDay activists this is a serious problem PERIOD The statistics are appalling  one in three women worldwide will be victims of some form of violence battering rape and harassment to name a few one of four college women will experience sexual assault  attempted or completed  and more than half of these violations go unreported PERIOD VDay Student organizer junior Kaitlyn Redfield comments After three years of being involved Ive come to understand that being silent on this issue is perpetuating the problem. by denying the pervasiveness of sexual assault we isolate the victims and fail to combat the problem PERIOD

At Notre Dame our illusions of being a family parietals and rules against premarital intercourse seem to erase from our consciousness issues of sexuality in general and sexual assault specifically PERIOD Junior Halle Kiefer sees the Monologues as a forum for victims friends and all people concerned with violence against women to find healing and seek answers PERIOD She says People say rape and assault doesnt happen here but it does behind closed doors and people have to deal with it. it is the women and men one of seven men experience a sexual assault suffering in silence the Monologues aims to console and give a voice for their pain and frustration PERIOD Redfield sees Notre Dame as having a strong culture of silence around these issues PERIOD The Vagina Warriors in response plan awareness events fundraisers for local sexual assault response centers and the Vagina Monologues to combat that silence and aid victims PERIOD

VDay also is a celebration of femininity and builds solidarity among the people involved PERIOD It is completely student planned and based PERIOD Redfield was inspired seeing college women taking action to end sexual assault PERIOD The community created through performing the show and planning events sustains its members PERIOD Kiefer and others find a chance to meet new friends connect more with current ones and build a positive community around important issues PERIOD VDay meetings are chalk full of laughter camaraderie and support which in such a diverse group of women is revolutionary PERIOD We can learn much from the model of the vagina warriors PERIOD As they endeavor to make themselves into a focused community of respect and peace they remake the world around them and battle a grave injustice PERIOD

To their critics VDay participants speak respectfully and seriously PERIOD Their mission to end violence against women and girls worldwide has been misconstrued in outrageous ways PERIOD Some associate their purpose with prochoice groups PERIOD To this Redfield says we must divorce discussions of violence against women and abortion debates PERIOD Just because they both deal with women it does not equate them. notre Dames Vagina Warriors have nothing to do with any prochoice groups for they are sponsored by University departments and the money they raise goes to SOS and YWCA in their ministries to victims of rape and domestic abuse PERIOD Junior Jackie Clark sees the binding of VDay and abortion issues as a major problem PERIOD For her The goal of the Monologues is to promote awareness PERIOD Its a shame they are associated inappropriately PERIOD

The recurrent attacks on VDay seem to be rooted in general misconceptions of feminism PERIOD The struggle for equality and dignity for women in public and private relationships continues PERIOD Redfield believes the boundaries between orthodox Catholicism and feminism wrongly hinder finding shared values PERIOD She holds that At the heart feminism and Catholicism both share the common goal of fostering peace and promoting the recognition of dignity of women and men. women in the movement assert their dignity through celebrating their gendered identity releasing frustration over shared oppression and inviting men and other women to know their joys and pains PERIOD

Now can you say it

The Vagina Monologues are here to educate liberate and agitate us all to be more proactive actors in the fight to end violence against women and girls PERIOD As sophomore Casey Stanton wrote in poetic verse we are all responsible we all must take up the fight its time to defend a Females Right to Life. see the show and engage the issues until the violence stops PERIOD
