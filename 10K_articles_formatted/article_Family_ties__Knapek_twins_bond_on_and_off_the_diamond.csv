If it werent for the numbers on the back of their jerseys it would be hard to tell the Knapek twins apart PERIOD The biggest physical difference between the two is Carter Knapek is lefthanded and is one inch shorter than Brooks Knapek who throws with his right and is listed at 6foot2 PERIOD

In their high school years the brothers began to help each other develop their arsenal of pitches PERIOD Both of them had a fastball changeup and curveball which Carter began to replace with his slider PERIOD This past winter Brooks went to his brother to help develop his slider PERIOD

I had to go to Carter for the grip Brooks said PERIOD I wanted to control it and have it be effective. the twins have been playing baseball since they were  years old PERIOD Since then they have been on the same team even if the sport was basketball or hockey PERIOD

The decision to continue playing on the same team was made in  when the brothers decided to leave the University of Massachusetts after their sophomore year and transfer to VCU PERIOD

Out of high school we both wanted to stay together Carter said PERIOD We decided we wanted to stay together again and VCU was just a great fit for us. the decision meant that they both had to redshirt and sit out during the  season PERIOD Both the brothers were with the team but could not play due to NCAA transfer rules PERIOD

It was a tough year Brooks said PERIOD Youre working out youre part of the team but youre kind of really not PERIOD  Youre not fighting for any playing time. the year away from playing in games did not mean the twins stopped competing with each other PERIOD Since they were kids the Knapeks have been competitive to push each other to perform well PERIOD

Always keeping that same standard Brooks said PERIOD Its also someone else watching your back making sure that you are performing to that standard. before their seasons were cut short due to the coronavirus Carter logged five appearances out of the bullpen while Brooks recorded one PERIOD The twins combined for nine innings pitched PERIOD

After their baseball careers are over Brooks and Carter Knapek dont plan to separate PERIOD Both enjoy many of the same activities and are majoring in political science PERIOD They both aspire to be sports agents PERIOD

We share the same major were in a bunch of the same classes Carter Knapek said PERIOD Whether its just homework or just hanging out we all have the same group of friends PERIOD We really do have a bunch of the same interests
