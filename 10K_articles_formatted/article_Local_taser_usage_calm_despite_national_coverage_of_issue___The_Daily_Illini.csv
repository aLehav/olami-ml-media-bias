Tasers are shocking the nation PERIOD This weapon originally designed to be a less lethal option than firearms may soon need to be reclassified PERIOD

One UCLA student was tasered for refusing to show campus ID PERIOD Another across the nation for resisting his forced exit from a political speech PERIOD The most recent and perhaps the most shocking of all earlier this month a pregnant woman was tasered PERIOD

Captain Tim Voges is with the Champaign County Sheriffs department PERIOD He says the reality of the taser situation is a little distorted PERIOD

The issue from the media side of it is the fact that it seems like theyre choosing to take all the bad instances instead of the good ones Voges said PERIOD Kind of like over in Iraq you have a lot of bad things happen but you have a lot of good things happen PERIOD And over there with the soldiers and the public doesnt hear that side of it. the Champaign County Sheriffs department is the only department in this area equipped with tasers PERIOD Voges says that because neighboring departments like Champaigns and Urbanas dont have them officers from his department are often there to help PERIOD

The agencies that dont carry them we get called quite a bit to assist them in a situation that again could end up being a fight with a suspect Voges said PERIOD The tasers are brought in just so youre not having to put hands on him and taking the chance on getting an officer injured. tasers are commonly used in situations where an individual refuses to comply with police orders PERIOD However some say that eyewitness video suggests that tasers are being used excessively and for inappropriate reasons PERIOD

Voges says that each taser that is deployed in his department is under a high level of scrutiny PERIOD

The tasers equipped with a computer in it and some are even equipped with cameras so it indicates the time of tasering the duration of the tasering cycle to indicate if you have abused somebody Voges said PERIOD And again the law enforcement side of the sheriffs office has not experienced any problems with that. for now the ChampaignUrbana area has yet to produce a controversial shock PERIOD",Local taser usage calm despite national coverage of issue - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
