The Executive Board of Phi Delta Epsilon poses for a group photo at the Gies College of Business Instructional Facility PERIOD

By Elizabeth Sayasane Staff writer April  

Not only are premed students oftentimes outstanding academically they also spend their undergraduate years focusing on RSO involvement volunteering for patient contact hours and developing other skills that allow them to stand out in the medical school application process PERIOD

Ashley Maras junior in LAS said she knew she needed to get involved immediately upon arriving on campus PERIOD She is the president of Phi Delta Epsilon a premed fraternity on campus PERIOD

Phi Delta Epsilon is the Universitys premed chapter of a national medical fraternity PERIOD It provides students looking to study medicine with a network of people who are on the same path PERIOD It also maintains relationships with its alumni who are currently in medical school PERIOD

Maras said that premed students have to determine what coursework they will need to do freshman year and plan for the next four years PERIOD Students also must try to be as involved as possible with volunteering RSOs leadership positions and research PERIOD

These expectations are quite demanding PERIOD



Youre supposed to show a lot of dimension but sometimes its hard because wheres the time Maras said PERIOD

The other members of Phi Delta Epsilons executive board agree with this assessment PERIOD Damee Moon junior in LAS is the fraternity secretary PERIOD Krish Patel junior in Business is the vicepresident of finance PERIOD Shree Patel sophomore doing an individual plan of study in computational neurosciences is the vice president of recruitment PERIOD

Shree Patel said that the requirements for medical school are beyond good grades PERIOD It also involves how you differentiate yourself PERIOD

Its a lot of juggling around Moon said PERIOD You have to have all of these things in the back of your mind. hollie Heintz can confirm this PERIOD Heintz works at the Career Center primarily as the Assistant Director for Health Professions PERIOD

None of these health professions are something that you can suddenly decide in one semesters time that youre going to do this it really takes a lot of preparation she said PERIOD

Heintz said she encourages students to everything they can to set them apart in medical school application PERIOD This can involve a number of healthrelated RSOs undergraduate research certification for EMT or nursing assistant and volunteering or working at any of the hospitals nursing homes or clinics on the bus line PERIOD

It is not an easy path to follow Maras said but it is important to start from day one of freshman year.Heintz said that the students path depends on what major the student is pursuing PERIOD

She said that MCB students may come to the Career Center sophomore year looking for guidance and would have been taking the required classes for medical school PERIOD What they need to catch up on is the extracurricular involvement PERIOD She also said some people do not realize until later that medicine is what they want to do PERIOD

Really I want to say its never too late as long as youre willing to put in the work Heintz said PERIOD

If a student decides later on in their college career that they want to go to medical school they have options PERIOD They can enroll as a nondegree to finish their medical school curriculum and can pursue a masters degree or a postbaccalaureate medical sciences program PERIOD Heintz said many med schools love applicants who have taken a gap year PERIOD They must also catch up on the patient contact hours and other community involvement PERIOD

It is also possible for students to bounce back from a bad grade freshman year PERIOD Krish Patel said that if you experience failure freshman or sophomore year it is important to show that you get better and better each year PERIOD

It depends on how you play it Moon said PERIOD It can be hard to come back to being competitive. maras however said that students can take alternative routes PERIOD She said that sometimes students will go to medical school in the Caribbean and then they will do their residency in the states PERIOD She said that if students want to have a career in medicine they will seek alternative routes to achieve their goals PERIOD

Additionally students can pursue a number of medical fields that are not centered around being a physician PERIOD Individuals can become Physicians Assistants Physical Therapists or Nurses to name a few PERIOD

Heintz says that the Career Center hosts workshops in April for students who have applied to medical schools and are waiting for an answer PERIOD She says that these workshops help students develop a plan B so even if they have no acceptance letter they can still hit the ground running PERIOD She says students have a number of ways to enter the world of healthcare PERIOD

Maras considered her own backup plan PERIOD

If it happens Ill figure it out then but until then I have to have this mindset that yes Im going to do it Maras said PERIOD
