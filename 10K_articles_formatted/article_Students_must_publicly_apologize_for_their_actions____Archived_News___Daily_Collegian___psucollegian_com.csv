I was just reading an article titled  and rightly it should PERIOD

I was literally sick to the stomach after reading how several Penn State students dressed up as Virginia Tech shooting victims for Halloween PERIOD

What is wrong with Penn State This year has really brought out what PSU really stands for PERIOD Look at the Ohio State fan incident the football team installments and now this PERIOD

For us seniors it puts a black mark on our career here one that has been filled with prestige and honor for Old State PERIOD I believe a public apology should and needs to be heard from students involved with this demeaning immature act PERIOD

Although our university president had nothing to do with these wrongdoings I believe he needs to speak for the university PERIOD Even then I believe Penn State has a huge whole to dig itself out of PERIOD

We need to rethink who we are and why We Are  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD
