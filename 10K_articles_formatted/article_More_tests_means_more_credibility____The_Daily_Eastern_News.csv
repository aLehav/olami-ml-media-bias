Tests tests and more tests PERIOD



That is the world of education just a neverending series of tests to prove the knowledge one has gleaned from a class and that said student is worthy of graduating to the next level PERIOD

Eastern students who are studying to enter this continuous cycle of tests may have another test to pass before they can go forth into the proverbial real world and become the ones administering the dreaded examinations of a students knowledge PERIOD

Last year the Illinois Board of Higher Education passed a mandate that would take affect in  forcing all education students to take a third test to earn their teaching certification PERIOD

Fast forward a year and Easterns Council on Academic Affairs is considering revising class requirements to include the new test required by the boards mandate PERIOD The proposed revision would affect those enrolled in Student Teaching Course STG  PERIOD Although it would be an unexpected inconvenience for those currently enrolled in the course it would be a benefit to those who take the course in semesters to come PERIOD

Some students may complain about the amount of tests education majors have to take in order to gain their certification but the tests are necessary PERIOD Teachers have the responsibility of feeding the young minds of future generations with knowledge PERIOD If poorly trained teachers are given this responsibility the intelligence of generations to come is in serious jeopardy PERIOD These tests insure the students of the future will have competent educators PERIOD

Although it is an annoying fact of life students have to take these required tests they do serve a purpose PERIOD By making the test a requirement to STG  Eastern will make these tests a little less annoying PERIOD Students have to take this test if it is part of the class or not PERIOD By making the test part of the class it is one less hoop students hoping to become teachers have to jump through after they leave Eastern PERIOD

With added test requirements and a new fiveyear plan for graduation its easy to say becoming a teacher has become an expensive hassle but teaching is about a love of educating not time spent preparing or the economic bottom line PERIOD

And more requirements equal greater credibility within the program PERIOD
