7648,1970-01-01,"last spring hundreds of Oregon college and university students traveled to the state Capitol steps to ask legislators to reinvest in higher education PERIOD They ended up with the most significant reinvestment in higher education since  PERIOD

The  million allocated to universities is in large part a result of the Oregon Student Associations work whose mission is to represent college and university students at the statewide level PERIOD

Theres a lot of decisions that affect students that are being made in Salem said Brett Rowlett OSA legislative director PERIOD With OSA at the table were able to guarantee that student interests are always considered. manYing Fong ASUO public relations coordinator said students will see the state funding help to curb rising tuition next year PERIOD

This past legislative session was the first time in about  years where the legislators actually looked at funding colleges and universities Fong said PERIOD But she said its not by any means a solution to the problem. reinvestment in higher education  million for Oregon universities and  million for Oregon community colleges. tuition increases capped at . percent  the median family income. a solid budget for OHSU to educate medical professionals. adoption of the Shared Responsibility Model which will theoretically close the affordability gap for students. state funding for ASPIRE Access to Student Assistance Programs In Reach of Everyone a high school mentoring program that increases access to college. maintained funding for the Student Child Care Program which enables some studentparents to attend college. legislation regarding textbook prices and student media freedom of speech. a commitment to discussing university resource fees PERIOD

Increased state funding is not the only thing student lobbyists achieved this year PERIOD The state passed several other pieces of legislation affecting students many of which OSA pushed for PERIOD

The legislature approved Governor Ted Kulongoskis proposed Shared Responsibility Model a major step forward for needbased aid in Oregon PERIOD Under the model students who borrow what they can and work outside of school will also be assisted by the state PERIOD The idea is for the state to step in to fill the affordability gap where the federal government does not PERIOD

In order to fund the Shared Responsibility Model the state more than doubled funding for needbased aid PERIOD

Several pieces of legislation were also approved last year including one that requires textbook publishing companies to disclose the full list of available textbooks to professors PERIOD Previously the publishers made recommendations to professors based on sales PERIOD Additionally the professors will have access to bookstore prices and dates of past editions PERIOD

The textbook legislation has a second component one that requires any materials associated with a textbook to be offered individually PERIOD For example textbooks that come with CDs or workbooks will not necessarily be sold as a package PERIOD Rather students will be able to choose which of the supplemental materials they want to purchase PERIOD

We really feel that even if it saves students a couple hundred dollars a year thats a couple hundred dollars students can spend on something else said Rowlett PERIOD

Currently OSA is determining its legislative agenda for the  session PERIOD Next week it will distribute a survey to students across Oregon campuses to gauge what students want to see discussed in Salem PERIOD Ultimately five or six key issues will become the focus of the next biennium PERIOD

Courtney Sproule OSA communications director said students helped carry reinvestment in higher education from a low state priority to a top issue PERIOD

Coming off this really successful session its just really important for students to know we still have a long road ahead of us Sproule said PERIOD Weve just started to make up for the things that were cut. contact the higher education reporter at agrasgreendailyemerald.com
