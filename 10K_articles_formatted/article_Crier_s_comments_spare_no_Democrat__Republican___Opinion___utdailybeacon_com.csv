Thanks to the Issues Committee students were able to hear from one of the

national medias most respected political analysts Tuesday night 

Catherine Crier PERIOD

Students from all majors particularly those in the College of

Communication flocked to the event PERIOD Crier spoke about the medias

perspective of the upcoming presidential election and the campaign now in

action PERIOD

Her ideas were fascinating PERIOD She criticized politicians for not taking

strong stands on important issues like foreign policy education and social

security PERIOD She complained political candidates change their opinions on

policy with every beat of the polls PERIOD

She chastised Bob Dole for not sticking to his antisupplyside economics

position hes made himself famous for PERIOD She equally ridiculed Al Gore for

taking the podium at the Democratic Convention with tears in his eyes

crying over his sister who died from the very cigarette industry he has for

years embraced PERIOD

But perhaps her harshest criticism was aimed at you those who vote for

these great politicians PERIOD And for just that reason PERIOD You we rather are

the ones who allow our leaders to change their stances more often than

Alfonse DAmato yells Whitewater. when we say we need a balanced budget we expect results right away PERIOD We

bully our politicians to come up with the most complicated financial plan

of the century right now no procrastination

And if they cant do it right away as in four years we vote them out of

office and hope the next guys can do it PERIOD The truth is no one can really

accomplish big things like balancing the budget without sufficient time

planning and support from voters PERIOD

Besides criticizing us about demanding immediate perfection on a policy

she blamed us for politicians inability to explain in detail how they plan

to solve a particular problem PERIOD

She was right when she said voters nowadays are perfectly content to make

their decisions based on meager sound bites on the evening news PERIOD Our

candidates dont talk seriously about substantive issues because we

wouldnt listen if they did PERIOD

Crier noted if we were truly interested in how candidates really

felt about issues the MacNeilLehrer report wouldnt suffer from ratings

somewhere below those earned by the laundry channel on a football Saturday PERIOD

Shes right PERIOD We get 12second solutions from politicians because thats all

the time we want to listen to them PERIOD Its easy for Bill Clinton to say

something like  without explaining how to do it PERIOD

He knows or at least his PR people know we dont really care PERIOD We dont

demand to know how PERIOD But we should PERIOD

If we continue to unwittingly demand inefficiency in politicians we will

have only ourselves to blame if our great democracy one day folds under the

stress of such  mentality PERIOD

If we want the best policies from our political leaders we need to start

listening to their ideas and giving them time to follow through with them PERIOD

We need to remember the best solutions take time PERIOD There are no overnight

cures to todays problems

We also need to abandon our love of sound bites and start insisting our

candidates talk to us like the intelligent people we are rather than the

impatient people we so often portray ourselves as PERIOD
