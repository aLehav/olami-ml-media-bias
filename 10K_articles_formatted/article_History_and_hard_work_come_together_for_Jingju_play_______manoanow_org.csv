Chinese Theater background

Since the 1980s Kennedy Theatre has been bringing a Chinese
theatre production to the main stage every three to four years PERIOD
Through its Asian Theatre Program Kennedy Theatre hopes to expose
students to as many different forms of Asian Theatre as possible PERIOD
Graduate student Nicole Tessier who plays Yang Zongbaos only
surviving son Yang Wenguang is an example of this
multiculturalism at work PERIOD

 Tessier said PERIOD Randai was the Asian Theatre
production last year and kabuki is a form of Japanese theater
brought to the main stage two years ago PERIOD

This years Asian Theatre production is a form of Jingju Chinese
theater which originated in Beijing during the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries PERIOD Jingju literally means  The
art encompasses many theatrical elements such as storytelling
acting song music dance and acrobatics PERIOD In China most Jingju
performers begin training at age eight to learn these skills PERIOD

UHM students had just six months of training for this Jingju
play PERIOD Theatre professor Elizabeth WichmannWalczak who is both the
director of  and UHMs Asian
Theatre Program has been planning this production since  and
has had connections to the world of Chinese theatre PERIOD

In the late 1970s Elizabeth WichmannWalczak became the first
nonChinese person to perform Jingju in the Peoples Republic of
China PERIOD Elizabeth spent two years studying and training with Madam
Shen Xiaomei a national actor of the first rank and an Emeritus
Principal Actress with the Jiangsu Province Jingju Company for her
lead role as Yang Yuhuan in the Beijing opera  at Nanjing University PERIOD

 WichmannWalczak said PERIOD

According to WichmannWalczak this cultural exchange was
welldocumented by the Chinese government and media PERIOD

 she said PERIOD

Play preparation

With the help of Xiaomei Professor Wichmann was able to get Lu
Genzhang Zhang Ling and Zhang Xigui all nationallyranked
performers and Emeritus leading artists in the Jiangsu Province
Jingju Company to come to UHM and train the students PERIOD Genzhang
taught acting movement and voice for all the malevoice roles
Ling taught the same for the female roles and Xigui taught
technique and interpretation for all the musical instruments
percussive and melodic PERIOD The sixmonth training process began in the
fall with classes in acting movement voice and music PERIOD

In the movement classes students learned how to tumble how to
use water sleeves ways of walking and running only used in Jingju
and spear work PERIOD

 he said through a Chinese interpreter PERIOD 

In the voice classes students learned speech patterns and
singing PERIOD Genzhang explained some the things he worked on with
actresses Nicole Tessier and Kelcie Awo for the malevoice
roles PERIOD


he said PERIOD

For the singing part students were given handouts written in
Chinese characters and English subtitles PERIOD In both the voice and the
acting classes students were encouraged to imitate the teacher PERIOD
Everything had to be learned in Chinese first before it was spoken
in English but some students found ways to make it easier PERIOD

 said performer KC Odell PERIOD

The music classes taught by Zhang Xiqui began in August at the
same time the acting voice and movement classes started up PERIOD The
music classes were divided into a melodic section and a percussive
section PERIOD In the melodic section the most important instrument is
the jinghu played by Charlotte DEvelyn PERIOD

 DEvelyn said PERIOD

Daniel Tschudi conductor of the percussion describes his
experience  he said.Lights costumes action

Another aspect of the play was costumes which involved hair and
head pieces make up and intricate clothing and body armor PERIOD Almost
every costume piece was imported from China PERIOD

UHM professor of theatre and costume Sandra Finney said that
because the hair and headdresses were so intricate the actors
couldnt put them on themselves so other students had to be
trained to do this for them PERIOD The mens hair and headdressings
including head wraps and gauzes take about five minutes to
dress PERIOD

It takes  to  minutes to apply the girls headdresses and
hair because it involves tying on ponytails and buns making curls
in the front and sticking in hair pins PERIOD She also noted that wigs
could not be used so there was a certain pain factor when the
actors werent moving around on stage PERIOD

Actors had to learn how to wear the kao battle armor which
included four flags tied tightly with rope to the chest region PERIOD
Actors Nick Logue Wang Wen Jessica Jacob Mu Guiying and Dusty
Behner Yang Qiniang had to begin rehearsing early with practice
flag packs to get used to the weight and the constrictions put on
the chest and back PERIOD

said PERIOD

The makeup is very individualized PERIOD In describing make up for
the Hua Lian male paintedface role Logue said
