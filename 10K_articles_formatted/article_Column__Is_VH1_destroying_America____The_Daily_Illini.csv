Spring break for me offered a brief but cherished return to the simple things soaking up a full nights sleep enjoying the drum lines from the Jurassic  CD I just bought eating a homecooked meal made with neither macaroni nor cheese and completing a few Sudokus PERIOD

I also got to bask in the warm glow of my longneglected television set and in particular the delightful barrage of popculture sound bites both past and present that can be found on VH1 my proposed slogan for which is TV for unemployed 20somethings who feel lame watching MTV PERIOD

Like most people I found moments of unadulterated glee watching VH1 which has made a startling transformation since its inception as a bastion for easy listening artists my proposed slogan for which had been TV for baby boomers who think music from the 60s and 70s is too subversive PERIOD

The transformation began with the I Love the 80s and I Love the 90s series which mined every possible piece of modern history and then some that could be used to exploit my sense of nostalgia PERIOD

There is a certain degree of comfort in discovering that all the things that were defining aspects of my childhood development were shared with an entire generation that the pleasures of the New Kids on the Block and Tim Burtons Batman were experiences not unique to me alone PERIOD



But there is also a sense of lost identity PERIOD If the milestones of youth are being provided to us through what seems like national syndication what is there to differentiate us There are times when I think I Love the 80s is an expos on how corporations destroy the dignity of individual human experience PERIOD

I dont actually believe that but it illustrates how watching VH1 extensively is a soulcrushing endeavor that will destroy any viewers sense of self or selfworth PERIOD

Was that an overstatement Yes but not by much PERIOD

VH1 draws us in with its sarcastic humorists who manage to provide just the right amounts of cynicism and selfawareness to garner hipster credentials PERIOD We are drawn in so much so that we fail to notice that none of these people have much more talent than the funnier members of our personal circles of friends PERIOD

Take Best Week Ever. we fail to notice that the objects of ridicule are the easiest targets in the world PERIOD Its like a Jay Leno monologue except younger better looking and more ironically detached PERIOD Basic Instinct  is a dumb idea No way Britney Spears is an irresponsible mother How edgy Maybe next week theyll attack Jerry Falwell for being a zealot because thats not apparent to anyone who hasnt had parts of their prefrontal lobe removed PERIOD

VH1s unique take on reality television on the other hand which it calls celebreality is endlessly fascinating PERIOD Who hasnt wondered what it would be like to experience life as a hasbeen lowgrade celebrity whose future simultaneously edges on being famous being infamous and being totally unknown

VH1 is just a small reflection of how our society has culturally politically and morally moved away from the things that elevate humanity embracing a deficit of ambition that appeals to our worst qualities PERIOD

In  a philosopher named Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote what has been called the manifesto of the Renaissance entitled Oration on the Dignity of Man. in it he writes Ignorant of how to yield to them and unable to endure the second places let us compete with the angels in dignity and glory PERIOD When we have willed it we shall be not at all below them. watching VH1 it is nigh impossible to see how we are the product of the evolution of this type of thinking PERIOD I am riveted by it but feel compelled to turn away and to urge others to do so as well PERIOD At least until the second season of Flavor of Love starts up PERIOD
