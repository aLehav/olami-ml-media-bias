Los Angeles roller coaster campaign to host the Olympics for a third time  an effort marked by early defeat and lastsecond negotiations  reached a conclusion Wednesday when the city was formally awarded the  Summer Games PERIOD

International Olympic Committee members voted their approval with a show of hands at a session in Lima Peru ending an unusual bid competition that resulted in two winners with Paris simultaneously awarded the  Games PERIOD

Like anything worth fighting for this was a long journey Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said PERIOD Little by little we got a victory. after the membership gave the cities a standing ovation IOC President Thomas Bach added It is really this winwinwin situation we were all together looking for. bach and Garcetti sat at a long table where the mayor signed the host city contract obligating L.A PERIOD to serve as a financial backstop paying off any debts should the estimated . billion sporting event run over budget PERIOD

The private LA  bid committee has vowed to control costs by using existing venues such as the Coliseum and Staples Center as well as the Rams stadium currently under construction in Inglewood PERIOD Bid leaders have emphasized that the citys two previous Games in  and  were financially successful PERIOD

This time they expect to cover all expenses through revenue from broadcast rights sponsorships ticket sales and other sources PERIOD But critics have noted that previous hosts  including Rio de Janeiro which staged the  Summer Olympics  had promised to balance their budgets only to come away with large deficits PERIOD

Despite the fact that the IOC has awarded L.A PERIOD the bid to host the  Summer Olympics the fight isnt over a grassroots group called NOlympics LA said in a statement PERIOD The notion that L.A PERIOD is going to have the Olympics one way or another isnt necessarily true as many opportunities still exist to intervene and stop them entirely. like Los Angeles Paris has hosted two Summer Games in  and  PERIOD

Wednesdays host city selection went smoothly with the candidates giving brief presentations before the ratifying vote PERIOD

L.A PERIOD offered  minutes of slickly produced videos interspersed with speakers who thanked each other thanked the Olympic movement and thanked Paris in the slightly flushed manner that often marks host city selections PERIOD

The women in the Southern California group wore bright pink and yellow PERIOD The men were dressed in suits and sneakers which bid Chairman Casey Wasserman  grandson of Lew Wasserman the late movie mogul  alluded to in his speech PERIOD

Now I know what youre thinking PERIOD  These L.A PERIOD guys seem pretty laidback Wasserman said PERIOD My grandfather told me the key to success was two simple things Always be honest and always stay true to who you are PERIOD Well what you see onstage here today reflects who we are and the unique brand of California cool that we will bring to the  Games. sounding a different note U.S PERIOD Olympic Committee Chairman Larry Probst spoke of the bids ups and downs saying It has been a formidable journey to get here but we never gave up hope or confidence in our ability to support and advance the Olympic movement. l.A.s campaign appeared to be over in the winter of  when the city lost to Boston in a USOC competition to become Americas sole bidder PERIOD

But the Massachusetts capital soon withdrew in the face of public opposition allowing L.A PERIOD to join what eventually became a twocity race with Paris for the  Games PERIOD

The competition appeared to be neckandneck then took a dramatic turn with whispers that the IOC might name two winners giving  to one city and  to the other PERIOD

The move made sense if only because there have been so few willing candidates in recent bid cycles PERIOD Hamburg Rome and Budapest had also withdrawn from the  race PERIOD

With two viable proposals Olympic leaders warmed to the idea of locking up summer hosts for the next  years PERIOD Tokyo is hosting the  Summer Games PERIOD

This way was not usual Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said PERIOD We invent this new way together. the main question was Which city would agree to take 

From the start Paris insisted it could not wait PERIOD Negotiations between L.A PERIOD and the IOC began in earnest in July and within weeks the deal was done PERIOD

In return for going second L.A PERIOD will not have to pay tens of millions in IOC fees and will get a  million advance most of which will go to funding youth programs citywide beginning as soon as next year PERIOD
LA  will also receive a larger slice of IOC revenues and will not have to give the IOC a standard  percent of its surplus if the Games run under budget PERIOD

The Los Angeles City Council unanimously supported the agreement last month at a session marked by a small but vocal protest PERIOD

When people say costs could run over I say For what  Garcetti said Wednesday PERIOD For a Rams stadium we dont own For arenas that are already built and used every day

LA  now turns its attention from the stress of bidding to the hard work of organization PERIOD Unlike other hosts it will have more than a decade to prepare PERIOD

What does history feel like Garcetti asked PERIOD It feels like this. c2017 Los Angeles Times
