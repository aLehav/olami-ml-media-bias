Freshman center Ashling Taylor plays water polo with such a fierce passion that some college coaches were hesitant in recruiting her out of high school because they thought she might be too difficult to handle PERIOD

As a prep player she already had a personality charisma and a knack for leading a comeback PERIOD

San Diego State water polo head coach Carin Crawford said she first saw the Newport Beach native play in Newport Harbors matchup against Santa Margarita High School late last February PERIOD

She pretty much turned the whole game around Crawford said PERIOD Her team was down by three or four goals and she singlehandedly got the team back in the game. playing water polo was a simple choice for Taylor PERIOD It matches her disposition PERIOD

The reason I like water polo is the intensity of the players Taylor said PERIOD I really like fighting with the girls PERIOD I just really get a kick out of it PERIOD In general water polo is pretty much wrestling under seven or eight feet of water. taylor is referring to the underwater jostling that goes on underneath the referees vision PERIOD

Girls will kick punch claw whatever Taylor said PERIOD I just get a rush out of it. added Crawford Taylors kind of a heavymetal girl PERIOD Shes extremely competitive and shes extremely aggressive PERIOD For that reason I think she does better for us in the more competitive games. it seems like the struggle only helps Taylor play better and shell likely step it up the more aggressive it gets in the water PERIOD

The more physical her defenders playing on her Crawford said the better it is for her. taylor can frustrate offenses with her defense playing with versatility in a position not generally regarded as one that is defensive PERIOD

Usually the center position is so demanding that we dont ask that person to do a lot of defense Crawford said PERIOD

Taylors scrappy play has sometimes resulted in opponents losing their composure and being kicked out of the game PERIOD

Shes subtle Crawford said PERIOD She holds but any good center does PERIOD Ive seen other opponents get very angry and usually they do something stupid that Ashling benefits from PERIOD Shes drawn a lot of kickouts for us. taylors unrelenting style of play rubbed her teammates the wrong way at first though Crawford said PERIOD She would even rip her teammates swimsuits even in practice PERIOD

I think in the beginning it was hard for the upper classmen to accept her Crawford said PERIOD

But in the end Taylor has been instrumental in helping SDSU play with more ferocity against opponents PERIOD

I think shes made everyone play better defense Crawford said PERIOD I think shes really had to earn respect from her teammates the hard way and shes done it by proving herself in big games. taylor didnt hesitate proving herself from the beginning of the season PERIOD In her first game on Feb PERIOD  she scored the gamewinning goal against Santa Clara in the final seconds PERIOD

I dont think I could ever forget her first college goal Crawford said PERIOD The team was really nervous our first game but she stepped out and scored the game winner. in her rookie campaign Taylor has scored  goals in  games including two against No PERIOD  USC on Saturday while shooting almost  percent PERIOD

The key to Taylors success has been her ability to use her ambidextrous scoring touch challenging defenders with her ability to score from either hand PERIOD

Crawford has been surprised by how easily Taylor can score with her left hand PERIOD

She has developed a pretty good shot with her left hand Crawford said PERIOD I think Taylor truly is ambidextrous PERIOD Ive never seen anyone in all the years Ive been coaching thats that good with their left hand. taylor said the upperclassmen who first butted heads with her are now helping her succeed PERIOD There have been times she has been unhappy with her performance and has gotten a welcome jolt of encouragement from her teammates PERIOD

I got really down on myself Taylor said PERIOD They helped me out of it. and Taylors confidence can only help to speed up her progress PERIOD

I think shes developing great Crawford said PERIOD Shes playing at a very high level right now PERIOD And I feel theres so much more improvement that is ahead of her PERIOD I see her being an AllAmerican candidate within her next three seasons.",Taylor-made â€“ The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
