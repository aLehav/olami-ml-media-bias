Strange Wilderness

Rating 

Starring

Steve Zahn Allen Covert Jonah Hill Justin Long

Plot

To save his animal show from being canceled Peter Zahn and his crew of misfits embark on a journey to find and film Bigfoot PERIOD

The Good

The cast of Strange Wilderness is the films greatest strength PERIOD Theyre a whoswho of supporting comedic players  from Kevin Heffernan Super Troopers to Jonah Hill Superbad  trying to oneup each other PERIOD

Since this is a Happy Madison production Adam Sandlers usual gang of regulars turn up but the true scene stealer is Justin Long whose character pulls one bizarre stunt after another PERIOD Besides stealing nitrous oxide from a dentist and wearing a wedding dress he also gets tattoos of eyeballs on his eyelids so that when hes asleep it looks like hes awake PERIOD

Strange Wilderness is filled with constant drug use excessive profanity and plenty of full frontal male nudity to go around PERIOD If thats not your cup of tea there are also shark attacks insane Vietnam vets and a scene with a turkey that will make you want to cancel Thanksgiving PERIOD

The Bad

For as many laughoutloud moments there are  and there are a lot  the film suffers from a terrible case of shoddy writing and story development PERIOD

Sure its a movie with a core audience that probably prefers High Times to The New Yorker but even the most stoned viewer will feel cheated by the lame and abrupt ending PERIOD For an hour and a half the film builds to the highly anticipated climax with Bigfoot but after a sophomoric series of events all interest is lost PERIOD

There are also more plot holes in this movie than the complete works of David Lynch combined PERIOD The geniuses behind Dickie Roberts Former Child Star treat the audience as ignorant and forgetful hoping that comedic schtick outweighs a disastrous story PERIOD

It also looks as if when filming of Strange Wilderness was complete the filmmakers had barely enough footage to last an hour PERIOD So to fill the void animal clips from what seems like  are used throughout with narrations that lose steam too quickly PERIOD

The Lowdown

If you enjoyed the criminally underrated Grandmas Boy or any other grossout comedy of the last five years you will surely be amused by Strange Wilderness. if not for Steve Zahn finally becoming a leading man and not a sidekick see it for the mindless and immature humor that thankfully doesnt involve Dane Cook PERIOD
