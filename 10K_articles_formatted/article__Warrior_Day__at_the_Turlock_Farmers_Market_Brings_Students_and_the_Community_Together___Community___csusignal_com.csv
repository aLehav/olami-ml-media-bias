Our program is dedicated to promoting science to K12 students PERIOD We sometimes go to different schools and hold tons of events and do science activities with the community Daisy Hernandez from the Science in Our Community program stated PERIOD

Its good to get young kids interested in the sciences early on PERIOD We wanted to come out and show the community that science can be fun Stan State alumnus and Science in Our Community member Sunpreet Kau added PERIOD
