Jordan D PERIOD Brown  Staff WriterApril  

As the COVID19 pandemic continues university administrators have prepared models for remote instruction in the fall as the likelihood of Morgan State and other colleges returning to facetoface instruction next semester seems low PERIOD

University President David Wilson said he will announce his official decision for the fall semester within the next three months but added that remote learning will most likely continue according to a press release PERIOD

Very little will change until a vaccine for COVID19 has been developed he said PERIOD

The planning models include the continuation of the current virtual learning protocol beginning the semester later in the fall while applying social distancing protocols and reopening the campus on its original date PERIOD

When the university transitioned to online learning this spring all student events were canceled or moved entirely virtual PERIOD Students are eager to return for the fall semester and arent looking forward to the continuation of online learning PERIOD

Mister Freshman Nathan Keesee an architecture major feels like he will miss opportunities to establish relationships with classmates and experience difficulty learning new material PERIOD The recently elected Mister Sophomore also expressed concern for students who live in different time zones PERIOD

As a stem major I feel like I do not have most of the materials or the information that needs to be learned in my classes he said PERIOD

Instructors like Sociology Professor Angela Howell believe the if the university proceeds with online instruction in the fall it will be a smoother transition PERIOD

We have the whole summer to tool up and plan Howell said Faculty will have time to think about things that worked this semester things that didnt work things they had to do in a certain way but now there will be more thought and planning for the next semester. all summer courses have transitioned online along with all orientation programs and open houses PERIOD

To prepare for the future of the upcoming semester Wilson appointed  members of the Morgan community to serve on the Special Remote Instruction Committee PERIOD The group will assess the experience of online instruction for the remainder of the spring semester to improve the virtual teaching and learning experience PERIOD

The committee was selected among students and faculty members to reflect the diversity and differences among the schools PERIOD Each department will be represented by a chairperson dean or student to get recommendations for remote instruction and serve as the voice for their community PERIOD

Jada Grant a junior computer science major is a student representative for the School of Computer Mathematical and Natural Sciences PERIOD

The undergraduate students are trying to make sure our student bodys voices are heard she said PERIOD Our goal is to make the best recommendations on behalf of the entire student body. grant along with the other student representatives within the committee created a google formto get feedback from students on their adjustments to online learning and life during the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD

Alliyah Moore Graduate Student Association president will represent her association on the committee PERIOD

The committee is going to collect our experiences during this whole process and that will help decide how the University will move forward any corrections that need to be made or any areas that need to be addressed she said PERIOD
