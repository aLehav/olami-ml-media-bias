Although the opportunity for a PittsburghPhiladelphia Super Bowl slipped away the two cities Although the opportunity for a PittsburghPhiladelphia Super Bowl slipped away the two cities did hook up last night for a Groundhog Day womens basketball game between Pitt and Villanova PERIOD

The only scheduled meeting for the instate foes in  went the same way as the previous five  with the Panthers on the losing end this time by a score of a  PERIOD

Liad Suez led all scorers with  for Villanova  overall  Big East while Kate Dessart Mager added  in  minutes off the bench PERIOD For the Panthers   Marcedes Walker scored  while Vika Sholokhova contributed  points PERIOD Sholokhovas doubledigit performance was her first in Big East play PERIOD

Im really really happy that Vika had a breakout game tonight head coach Agnus Berenato said of her freshman forward PERIOD Vikas been struggling and I think you saw some of the things that Vikas capable of doing. marcedes grew tired because we were going inside to her and there were always a lot of kids around her PERIOD She couldnt even get across the paint without being held she added on the topic of her other freshman PERIOD

The game began with both teams in rhythm on the offensive end  every possession for each team in the first three minutes resulted in points PERIOD

But when the Panthers cooled off the Wildcats continued their hot shooting throughout the first half taking advantage of crosscourt passes to get open shots allowing them to knock down  of  field goals PERIOD

The Panthers meanwhile only scored five points in the final  minutes leading to a woeful total of  for  from the floor for the half PERIOD Yet even with the poor shooting Pitt only trailed  at halftime PERIOD

The second half provided a different story on the Panthers offensive end but more of the same for Villanova PERIOD The Wildcats dominant shooting continued as they finished the game shooting a blistering . percent  for  PERIOD

They run a motion offense and they have a lot of players that look like clones Berenato said about Villanova PERIOD Theyre all very good at fundamentals  Passing shooting  and theyre average at dribbling. the victory was an historic one for the Wildcats because it gave their head coach Harry Perretta  wins for his 27year career at Villanova PERIOD Perretta has the most wins in Villanova basketball history  men or womens  and has been the Wildcats coach since  when he took the helm at age  PERIOD

The loss for the Panthers drops them to  at the Petersen Events Center for the year something Berenato attributed to more than just unfortunate scheduling PERIOD

When were on the road weve really done a great job of teaching them how to focus she said PERIOD Turn it around at home the night before we have no control over them they all have night class they stay up late and study PERIOD On the road we have a curfew  oclock. saturday afternoon holds the next opportunity for the Panthers to try to break the home slump and their threegame conference losing streak when they host No PERIOD  Notre Dame at  p.m PERIOD for their third annual Pack the Petersen promotion PERIOD
