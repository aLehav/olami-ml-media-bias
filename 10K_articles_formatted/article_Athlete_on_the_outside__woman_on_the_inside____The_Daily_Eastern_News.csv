Most of the time when I tell people that I play rugby I get different responses PERIOD



The most frequent ones however are what interest me PERIOD

Really

No Way. where do you hide it

So do you have to wear those funny hats

Sometimes I love telling people just to see what response I will get next PERIOD

First of all Where do you hide it what is that supposed to mean

Is that supposed to be a compliment

Just because you play rugby doesnt mean that you have this manly figure PERIOD

You dont have to be a certain weight height or body type PERIOD

You have to be fit and have an attitude PERIOD

When junior Crystal Jones started playing last year she was only about  pounds PERIOD

People were like

No way can she play. shes too small shell get hurt. if you dont know Jones then dont ever say shes too small to do something because she will take that and throw it right back in your face PERIOD

When she goes on that field and runs through people its like shes  and  pounds PERIOD

She has a big heart and a big attitude PERIOD

Which the rest of the girls have as well PERIOD

Coach Frank Grazianos lifting program isnt made for us to bulk up and get huge PERIOD

It is for us to stay fit and to be strong PERIOD

Some people dont realize that you dont have to look muscular or be huge in order to be strong PERIOD

We have girls on our team between  foot  inches  pounds and   who can bench in the   and  range but if you saw us in normal clothes you wouldnt be able to tell PERIOD

We dont have muscles ripping out of our shirts PERIOD

When people think of rugby they think of football and that is mostly male dominated and then you have to be tough to play which is true we are tough but we are not manly PERIOD

We dont go around advertising it but that doesnt mean that we arent proud PERIOD

Im proud to be strong and proud to be a part of something that not everybody can be a part of PERIOD

Im also proud to say that I play rugby to those who ask and for those of you who giggle or dont believe me just because Im short and petite come to a game and see where that puts me on the field PERIOD

Guarantee you wont believe its the same girl PERIOD

Just like you wont believe the rest of the team if you ever meet any of them PERIOD

We arent just rugby players when we wear our uniforms or our funny little hats we are rugby players in the classroom at home and even when we do our homework PERIOD

It doesnt define who we are but it is a part of who we are PERIOD

So I guess next time someone tells you that they play rugby dont sound so surprised when you respond PERIOD

Oh and watch out for Jones PERIOD
