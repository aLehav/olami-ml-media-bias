Daniel BarnesFebruary  

A crisp midwinter breeze rustled through the clipped green grass of the outfield PERIOD The sun peeked through the clouds and reflected off the waggling aluminum bat as the pitcher curled into his stretch. and then incivility punctured the serenity at Hornet Field. his stomachs crowding the plate yelled one fan from behind the backstop. god forbid he hits a home run hell never make it around the bases shouted another farther down the third base line. the comments were being directed at Michael Tucker Vasquez the rotund designated hitter for California State University Stanislaus Sac States opponent this February afternoon. vasquez is 5foot8 and quite generously listed at  pounds.After Vasquez failed to leg out a grounder another fan added Next time just roll him down to first The verbal abuse resumed every time Vasquez stepped out of the dugout. granted the most extreme vulgarity on display at Hornet Field emanated from its usual spot atop the parking garage overlooking the outfield where offseason football players and other assorted meatheads park their SUVs and scream obscenities at anyone who isnt shirtless and wearing their baseball cap backwards. however some of the most malicious comments came from a small crowd gathered on the aluminum bleachers PERIOD It came from students parents and boosters who should know better. civility and obscenity have always meshed uneasily in the world of baseball  its a leisurely lawn game played with the spikes up  but something seemed particularly harsh and unnecessary about the verbal beating Vasquez took. vasquez isnt a professional baseball player sleepwalking his way through a longterm contract PERIOD Nor is he an egomaniacal pro basketball player eating himself out of the league while cashing a huge paycheck a la Shawn Kemp or Oliver Miller. he doesnt play for a rival school like Davis or a snooty opponent such as Berkeley PERIOD He doesnt even play for a divisional rival because Sac State baseball went independent this season. tucker Vasquez is simply an overweight 24yearold amateur from Gilroy Calif PERIOD who wants to play baseball. and by all accounts Vasquez is a pretty good baseball player PERIOD He went 3for8 with one RBI in the series against the Hornets and leads his team in home runs despite a recent slump. the scene at Hornet Field hardly qualifies as the ugliest fan behavior Ive ever witnessed firsthand PERIOD Ive seen an entire stadium of Oakland As fans scream bloody murder at the sight of Jason Giambi in pinstripes PERIOD Ive seen bottles hurled onto the playing floor at Kings games PERIOD Ive seen Raiders fans vandalize and urinate on a Jeep with a Broncos decal on it. a few fat jokes seem almost warm and cozy by comparison PERIOD Unlike the Sac StateStanislaus game though those incidents occurred at pro sporting events involving passionate rivalries that were attended by tens of thousands of juicedup fans. the verbal abuse that Tucker Vasquez endured from the sparse crowd at Hornet Field however was crudeness for the sake of crudeness and wholly unnecessary PERIOD
