Around  people nationwide applied to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program this year PERIOD As of June  less than  percent of people have been approved for the program by the U.S PERIOD Department of Education PERIOD

Now University of Minnesota professional students  many of who aim to go into careers that qualify for PSLF  are demanding answers PERIOD

The Universitys Professional Student Government passed a resolution last month urging University administration to determine why so few applicants qualified for PSLF PERIOD Earlier this month PSG President Alanna Pawlowski met with the President Eric Kalers Office to discuss the resolution PERIOD

Pawloski said it is University officials responsibility to seek answers because the University has encouraged students to apply for the PSLF program PERIOD

There is some responsibility on the University to help its students figure out how to navigate this in the future Pawlowski said PERIOD She said the University has been receptive to PSGs requests PERIOD

PSLF was passed by the U.S PERIOD Congress in  PERIOD It allows people who pursue public service jobs  such as positions in government schools or nonprofits  not to pay the remaining balance on loans accrued from college PERIOD

We tend to take out more loans for our studies rather than receiving stipends from our departments Pawlowski said of professional students PERIOD Many professional students are told by our schools or by our departments in particular that one option for managing our loans for after graduation would be if we go into public service work. applicants can qualify for PSLF if they make  monthly payments for their direct loans while working fulltime following specific program qualifications.Because applicants have to make  years worth of payments  was the first year applicants could qualify for the program and results were released last summer PERIOD

But the low number of applicants who qualified for the program prompted  Democrats in Congress to sign a letter released in October urging Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to provide more information about the process PERIOD

As of November the Department of Education is offering a temporary opportunity for denied PSLF applicants to get their loans forgiven PERIOD Applicants must send an email requesting the government to reconsider their applications PERIOD

The Government Accountability Office released a report in September about their investigation of the program PERIOD

The report calls for more transparency from the federal government on the program similar to what many University professional students are asking for PERIOD

PSG passed their resolution after learning the majority of people who applied did not qualify for PSLF PERIOD

Im a student at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs which is primarily students who are looking to enter government to do some sort of public service said Michael Sund a PSG member who proposed the resolution PERIOD We typically are folks that could for instance switch to a different degree  and make considerably more money but a lot of folks chose the public sector or nonprofit out of some sort of feeling that theyre making the community a better place. sund said the Department of Education has failed to provide clear reasoning explaining why so many applications were rejected PERIOD He said students were told that many applicants did not apply under the right type of loan or make appropriate payments PERIOD

I guess I just dont understand Sund said PERIOD I just want answers in general like Why

Corrections A previous version of this story misspelled the PSG presidents name PERIOD Alanna Pawlowski is the PSG president PERIOD

A previous version of this story wrongly attributed information to the GAO report PERIOD The information came from the Democrat Education Workforce and blamed the Trump administration for the number of rejected PSLF applications PERIOD
