Speaking in Ojibwe the Native American dialect of the Saginaw tribe students at Saginaw High School recited a newly learned mantra The Trojans will go to college. as one of the faculty members who is a part of the Wolverine Express program  a program that brings University faculty staff and students to Michigan high schools to promote higher education  Margaret Noori director of the Universitys Comprehensive Studies Program led the high school students in the chant last month hoping to encourage underrepresented students like them to pursue a college education PERIOD

Wolverine Express was created this past fall as a program of the Center for Educational Outreach in conjunction with the Universitys Diversity Council PERIOD  The schools involved in the Michigan College Advising Corps a program that places University graduates in underrepresented Michigan schools to serve as college advisers were chosen for the Wolverine Express program PERIOD

William Collins executive director of the Center for Educational Outreach and a member of the Diversity Council said he felt the new initiative would complement the advising program well PERIOD

We married the Wolverine Express to our Advising Corps Program he said PERIOD It meant a great deal of work in a relatively short period of time. the creators came up with the idea last summer and developed the initial stages throughout the fall working with high school principals and counselors to determine the best ways to assist students PERIOD Collins said when they were ready to begin all eight schools in the advising program also wanted to be involved with Wolverine Express PERIOD

Because many of the students in the schools would be firstgeneration college students they may not know what is necessary to do to get started in certain job fields Collins said PERIOD

The background information of what one needs to do to pursue a particular career is often missing for many of these students he said PERIOD

For example students dont necessarily make the connection that becoming an engineer requires extensive knowledge of applied mathematics or that medicine involves advanced science and chemistry skills Collins said PERIOD

One of the things that happens when faculty members go into these schools is students have the opportunity to interact with them directly Collins said PERIOD It allows them to identify with what that person is doing. the purpose of Wolverine Express isnt to recruit for the University Collins said but rather to encourage students to pursue higher education PERIOD This message is important he said because the United States has shifted focus from primarily manufacturing jobs to service jobs particularly in the state of Michigan PERIOD

The jobs that are available to young people today increasingly are jobs that require postsecondary education Collins said PERIOD

Noori who is also a lecturer of American Culture and English emphasized the significance of a college degree when she spoke to Saginaw High School Students PERIOD She told the students that their education is extremely valuable and cant be taken away by others despite difficult economic circumstances PERIOD

University alum Ryan McBride who is serving as a college adviser at Saginaw High School through the Michigan College Advising Corps said he estimates that more than half the high schools student body participated in Wolverine Express PERIOD He said the program was beneficial to the students because they had a chance to meet professors and learn from their research and knowledge PERIOD

It gave them a really good glimpse into what college is like McBride said PERIOD It exposed them to people who work in higher education. he said the program inspired the students and gave them the confidence that they could pursue higher education. she added that it is important for schools like the University to focus on reaching out to these students PERIOD

I think its easy for schools like ours to become potentially elitist and selective in ways that arent necessarily the most healthy Diversity makes for a stronger structure Noori said PERIOD

While visiting Saginaw High School Crisca Bierwert chair of the Universitys Diversity Council set out to inspire the students by giving a brief lesson on the Treaty of  explaining how the state of Michigan bought the land on which the University was built and at its inception the University only had  students enrolled PERIOD

I told them that this is a story of small beginnings and big accomplishments and I hoped it would inspire them to go to college Bierwert said PERIOD I told them that I thought they could all make history and that they would all make history. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
