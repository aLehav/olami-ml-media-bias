The members of the  Spring Semester Board of Opinion are

The  senior class gift might never be built and some students are upset PERIOD

The class gift proposal which will restore a greenhouse that used to be attached to Old Botany is estimated to cost about  PERIOD The Class of  raised  PERIOD

Those students and alumni who are upset that the university isnt automatically picking up the  difference are missing the point of a gift PERIOD

A senior class gift is a thankyou to the university for all that it has done for its students PERIOD It is a physical reminder of students who once strolled the campus attended classes and lived the Penn State experience PERIOD

To ask for Penn States financial help would cheapen the meaning of the senior class gift PERIOD It would be more like a Penn State handout to the Class of  PERIOD

The greenhouse plan includes the installation of an environment friendly system called a Living Machine which uses plants and animals to filter contaminated water PERIOD The state Department of Environmental Protection has pledged money to the Living Machines project but if the greenhouse isnt built the state grant might be lost PERIOD Penn State President Graham Spanier however assured students at his fireside chat Tuesday night that the Living Machine would be built without touching the class gift funds PERIOD

Although a Living Machine would be a welcome addition to campus the first priority for the Class of  is to either find more alumni donations to completely fund the cost of the greenhouse or to simply find a less expensive class gift PERIOD If the Class of  senior class gift committee had done its research properly there wouldnt be a sudden scramble to explain from where  is going to come PERIOD

This should serve as a lesson to the  senior class gift committee to make sure that something like this does not happen again PERIOD Once the committee discovers how much money the Class of  will pledge to the class gift they should make sure it is sufficient to cover the costs of placing lamp posts along the Willard Mall PERIOD
