Sunshine a gentle breeze and lots of fresh air are usually the backdrop for a day off but yesterday some administrators faculty and students gathered to examine diversity ethics and University relations PERIOD

Encampment a 39yearold Penn State tradition which brings students together with University leaders continued at Stone Valley Recreation Area this year with a full day of activities for the  people who attended PERIOD

Utilizing group forums to help people at all levels of Penn State understand each other better the informal setting also encourages participants to take what they learn about each other and apply it to their daily operations said Sherri Rutolo cochairwoman of the event PERIOD

 she said PERIOD 

Rutolo emphasized that most participants get out of Encampment what they bring to it and if that is an open mind the individual will gain a lot PERIOD

But one faculty member said a shortcoming of Encampment is that the discussions fail to reach those who need them the most PERIOD

 she said PERIOD

During three rounds of groups discussions participants talked about their perspectives on the University PERIOD Participants were organized in small group sessions of about  to  people sitting in circles on folded chairs in the grass PERIOD But even during discussion sessions scheduled to talk about values and innerUniversity relationships conversation continually drifted to the topic of diversity PERIOD

Brian McKernan a member of the Lesbian and Gay Student Alliance and a group facilitator for the discussion on diversity started by asking his group what diversity is PERIOD

The group met his question with silence at first PERIOD

But soon definitions of diversity were flying and everyone seemed to have their own idea about what it means PERIOD

Pat Peterson assistant vice president for campus life summed up the Universitys official definition of diversity as a cultural rather than individual one PERIOD

But other group members said one definition is not enough PERIOD

 said Bruce Fair internal affairs director for LGSA PERIOD His opinion was upheld by other responses PERIOD

Dominic Mattioni executive assistant for the Undergraduate Student Government said diversity is  but he cautioned against limiting the definition PERIOD

 Mattioni said PERIOD

All the participants agreed that achieving a diverse University community begins with toleration an idea brought up by Dane Foust assistant to the director of University Residence Hall programs PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

When McKernan asked if students at the University were  about diversity Academic Assembly President Stephanie Bozym said establishing values about diversity from the top down could be detrimental PERIOD

 she said PERIOD

Some participants like Foust questioned whether the University should be directing views on diversity and indicated that individual free speech could be infringed upon PERIOD

Faust cited the case of James Whitehead who sent a threatening message about gay men and lesbians over University computer systems last spring as one case where Penn State could not infringe on a students free speech PERIOD

The University did not discipline Whitehead saying his action was protected under the First Amendment PERIOD

Peterson said Penn State has more problems than private schools in instituting protection from racist sexist or homophobic slurs because a public university can not infringe on an individuals constitutional rights PERIOD

Private institutions have more freedom to create their own rules she said PERIOD

Here at Penn State  Peterson added PERIOD
