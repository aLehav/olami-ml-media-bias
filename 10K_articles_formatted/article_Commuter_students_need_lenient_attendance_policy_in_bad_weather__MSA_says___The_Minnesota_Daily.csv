In the interest of student safety during harsh Minnesota winters the Minnesota Student Association is drafting a resolution to change class attendance policies for students who commute to the University of Minnesota PERIOD

Though in the early stages of drafting this resolution the undergraduate student government is seeking to add a clause to the current University attendance policy to increase leniency for students who drive to campus PERIOD

By creating the clause MSA hopes to reduce pressure on students to come to class in dangerous conditions. in addition if attendance is mandatory and a part of the classs grade percentage the resolution asks that students are not penalized according to MSA Academic Affairs Committee Director Calista Mateuszczyk PERIOD

However the Office of Undergraduate Education said it is not considering altering the attendance policy at this time PERIOD

The policy which contains exemptions from penalty for missing class like illness jury duty and bereavement does not take into account transportation in severe weather according to MSA members PERIOD

For commuter students this can mean choosing between their personal safety and their grades PERIOD

Its unfair that students are weighing their life and safety with their grades said Victoria Nikonov an MSA academic affairs committee member PERIOD

As a former commuter student Nikonov remembers the stresses that come with driving to class in severe weather PERIOD She said she thinks the University does not consider commuter students enough PERIOD

Its a significant population and the stress and danger isnt worth it Nikonov said PERIOD

The OUE which oversees the attendance policy said that during severe weather it consults with many groups across campus as well as the cities of Minneapolis and St PERIOD Paul in determining whether to cancel classes across the University PERIOD

In the interest of equity OUE said changing the policy would not be fair to all students PERIOD

If we exempted students from having to come to class when other students are having class these are different standards for students being here or not being here said Jennifer Reckner the OUE chief of staff PERIOD

Under special circumstances professors can determine on a casebycase basis if an absence by a student is unavoidable or legitimate as stated in University policy PERIOD

Karl Penaz who commutes about  miles to campus from Maple Grove and is a chair member of the student group Commuter Connection said he has to make it a point to meet with his professors at the beginning of each semester specifically on this issue PERIOD

It really is up to the instructors discretion Assistant to the Vice Provost and Dean for Undergraduate Education Jessica Kuecker Grotjohn said PERIOD There is a huge range where students are coming from and what their specific situations are. as MSA pushes its advocacy Nikonov said they plan to narrow the definition of an offcampus student or commuter student to those who have to drive a certain amount of time by car to campus PERIOD

Secondyear student Faith Ochwangi who commutes from Brooklyn Park about  miles from campus said that while she understands why attendance policies are in place driving in severe weather impacts her mental health PERIOD

It takes a lot out of you because you cant really focus on class youre focusing on the weather for the most part Ochwangi said PERIOD People are in the ditches but I have to go to school  My grade comes before my own mental health my personal safety. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
