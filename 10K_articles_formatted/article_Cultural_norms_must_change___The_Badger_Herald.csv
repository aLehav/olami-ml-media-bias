2888,2009-03-05,"pAVE Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment was saddened by the frontpage article Alleged Rape at Sigma Chi published Wednesday March  in The Badger Herald PERIOD While the report of the assault itself was extremely disturbing some of the comments posted by UW students on The Badger Herald website in response to the article were equally troubling PERIOD Many of these responses reveal we live in a culture in which we are more apt to blame sexual assault victims than to hold perpetrators accountable PERIOD

How does she know she didnt consent the night before I often find credit card bills for pizza or drinks I dont remember and retrospectively did not want but likely assented to in my intoxicated state. an anonymous comment posted to the Badger Herald website at 1238pm on March  PERIOD

When discussing the line between consensual sex and alcoholfacilitated sexual assault it is important to recognize that certain norms within drinking culture work to perpetuate and reinforce harmful and abusive behaviors PERIOD Taking advantage of someones intoxicated state is predatory behavior PERIOD In the majority of cases alcoholfacilitated sexual assaults are premeditated by perpetrators who are often less intoxicated than victims PERIOD The false victim blaming beliefs posted on The Badger Herald website reinforces that we do live in a culture that tolerates and excuses alcoholfacilitated sexual assaults PERIOD

Sexual assault is never the victims fault PERIOD Rather than focusing on a victims drinking as a campus community we should focus on why a perpetrators behavior is generally excused by our culture when alcohol is involved PERIOD Alcohol can impair ones ability to give consent PERIOD If you are looking to have a sexual encounter it is your job to make sure your partner is sober enough to give consent PERIOD If your partner passes out vomits has trouble walking or talking or makes decisions heshe might not make if sober he or she might not be able to give consent PERIOD Make sure to talk to your partner so everyone has a good experience PERIOD

It is important to remember that while statistically most perpetrators are men most men are not perpetrators PERIOD The alleged perpetrators are members of the campus community the victim is also a part of the campus community PERIOD As the individuals who compose the student population at UWMadison how are we supporting victims and how are we holding perpetrators accountable We cannot say in the same breath the victim of a violent crime  including rape  is not to blame for what happened to them and then say that they cannot go out drinking at night with their friends without asking for it. simply put something has to change PERIOD By accepting rape as an inevitable occurrence we risk creating a campus climate that endangers both men and women PERIOD Labeling an entire fraternity house as rapists is harmful to men PERIOD Violating womens bodies is harmful to women PERIOD Men and women both stand to gain from a culture that supports healthy consensual sex PERIOD

Although the victim in this case is incredibly admirable for sharing her story in a very public forum it is important to remember victims who do not share their stories publicly are no less admirable PERIOD Every victim is different and thus each victim will react differently PERIOD For instance some victims may wish to report their assault to the police while others may choose to remain silent PERIOD Whatever the victim decides to do it is important to remember that ultimately the decision is the victims and not ours to judge for appropriateness PERIOD

In the wake of these events it is important for us all to step back and take a critical look at how we as students are responding to this assault PERIOD We thank victims for their courage and for sharing their stories with us PERIOD PAVE believes every time a member of our community is harmed it affects everyone PERIOD We are eagerly awaiting the UWMadison student body to echo that feeling PERIOD
