Live from Dallas its Saturday Night

This Saturday greatness was witnessed PERIOD But not just any kind of greatness the rare form of greatness that sits with his legs crossed and with a stern smirk prepared for a line of questioning PERIOD

Saturday Night Live Creator and Executive Producer Lorne Michaels came to the George W PERIOD Bush Presidential Center Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

Former President George W PERIOD Bush walked across the stage and introduced the man of the hour PERIOD

I am confident the writers are thrilled with todays campaign Bush joked PERIOD

Michaels walked out with panel moderator Will Geist of NBC and they took their spots PERIOD

Are you sure you dont want to run for a third term Geist said to the former president PERIOD

And then the line of questioning began PERIOD Several topics were discussed but the most important ones pertained to the medias interaction with the presidency and campaigns PERIOD Michaels explained that most people who watch SNL are those who are middle aged and have a basic understanding of the news PERIOD

Educating them about whats going on and being funny about it is easier when theyve already seen it Michaels said PERIOD

Geist asked what it took to make a good impersonation when it came to depicting a president PERIOD Michaels explained that every impersonation is based on an exaggeration of a truthful feature PERIOD He said that the best impersonators are those who capture the essence of an honest feature PERIOD

The Bush Center put together a montage of the best clips of presidential impersonations which made the crowd laugh hysterically PERIOD

Dana Carvey captured something no one else could PERIOD Its much harder to do someone you dont admire Michaels said of Carveys impersonation of President George Bush as he addressed the nation on the war in Iraq PERIOD

The crowd laughed especially hard when Michaels revealed that Sarah Palins crazy resemblence to Tina Fey was brought to his attention by the doorman of his building PERIOD

Michaels noted that one must also know the appropriate time to laugh PERIOD After catastrophic events like  and the Paris Attacks Michaels said sometimes the best way to honor the loss of loved ones is by making them laugh PERIOD

One of our greatest strengths is that we make fun of our leaders and religion and our safety belt  be a country with a level of confidence Michaels said PERIOD

Throughout the event audience members were hoping to get a sense of who Michaels was rooting for through this campaign season PERIOD While most were unable to detect his unbiased partisanship he did mock Trump PERIOD

Trump says things we are educated to not say he said PERIOD

Michaels said that there is still a long run until the election in November however everyone should be informed on the nations candidates their policies and what each has to offer  even if it is portrayed in a comedic matter PERIOD

Comedy is light hostility PERIOD You say what you want to say and its in bounds without being rude or being unfair Michaels said PERIOD
