WASHINGTON AP  Clinton and Bush administration
officials engaged in fruitless diplomatic efforts instead of
military action to try to get Osama bin Laden out of Afghanistan
before the Sept PERIOD  attacks a federal panel said yesterday PERIOD Top
officials countered that the terror operation would have occurred
even if the United States had been able to kill the alQaida
leader PERIOD

Defense Secretary Donald H PERIOD Rumsfeld and Secretary of State
Colin Powell in a strong defense of preSept PERIOD  actions that have
become a major campaign issue told the federal commission
reviewing the attacks that the plot was well under way when the
Bush administration took office in January  PERIOD

Killing bin Laden would not have removed alQaidas
sanctuary in Afghanistan Rumsfeld said PERIOD Moreover
the sleeper cells that flew the aircraft into the World Trade
towers and the Pentagon were already in the United States months
before the attack. powell said that even if U.S PERIOD forces had invaded Afghanistan
killed bin Laden and neutralized alQaida I have no reason
to believe that would have caused them to abort their
plans. separately President Bush said Monday that he would have acted
more quickly before Sept PERIOD  had my administration had any
information that terrorists were going to attack New York City on
Sept PERIOD . the testimony by Rumsfeld and Powell came against the backdrop
of counterterrorism adviser Richard Clarkes claim that top
Bush administration officials had ignored bin Laden and the threat
of the alQaida terror network while focusing on Iraqs
Saddam Hussein PERIOD

Powell did not mention Clarke but said President Bush
and his entire national security team understood that terrorism had
to be among our highest priorities and it was. yet not until the day before the attacks did U.S PERIOD officials
settle on a strategy to overthrow the Taliban Afghan government in
case a final diplomatic push failed PERIOD That strategy was expected to
take three years the commission said PERIOD

The commission report said U.S PERIOD officials in both the Clinton
and Bush administrations feared a failed attempt on bin Laden
could kill innocents and would only boost bin Ladens
prestige PERIOD And the American public and Congress would have opposed
any largescale military operations before the September 
attacks the report said PERIOD

In the end it said pursuing diplomacy over military action
allowed bin Laden and other alQaida leaders to elude capture PERIOD

The panel investigating Sept PERIOD  formally the National
Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States is holding
two days of hearings with toplevel Bush and Clinton administration
officials PERIOD The aim is to question them on their efforts to stop bin
Laden in the years leading up to Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

The commissions staff has spent months interviewing
Clinton and Bush administration officials and poring over
documents PERIOD Its preliminary findings included in two statements
issued Monday will be considered by the 10member panel which
plans to issue a final report this summer PERIOD

The staff reports found both administrations lacked the detailed
intelligence needed to strike directly at bin Laden so they
fruitlessly sought a diplomatic solution to get the alQaida leader
out of Afghanistan PERIOD
