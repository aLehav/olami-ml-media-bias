In their last meeting of the semester the University of Michigan Central Student Government discussed a new resolution for all classes to have audio transcriptions available for students PERIOD The Assembly also held a presentation about the Student Organization Funding Committee for new Assembly members PERIOD

LSA junior John Pasquella who introduced the audio transcriptions resolution said the intended audience is both nonnative English speakers and anyone who feels they would benefit from having a class transcript available PERIOD

With lectures online it seems prudent that youd be able to access transcripts afterward Pasquella said PERIOD

Public Health junior Nithya Arun a CSG policy adviser endorsed the resolution PERIOD While the resolution focuses on access to class transcriptions Arun said this resolution is most important for its impact on the academic wellbeing of nonnative English speaking students PERIOD

I think the idea of using transcription services for accommodations is something that all of us would like to see and would like to work on in the future but its not necessarily the goal of this resolution Arun said PERIOD This resolution is more to increase accessibility to classes for nonnative English speakers and other individuals who might have problems. lSA junior Eman Naga a CSG policy adviser discussed her experience with the NonTraditional Students Commission a group appointed by CSG to focus on issues involving nontraditional students PERIOD She said many international students had a hard time with virtual courses this semester based on the speaking style of their instructors PERIOD

It is a helpful tool for a lot of students Naga said PERIOD I lead the commission on nontraditional students and a lot of international students were saying they were having a hard time picking up things because the professors were speaking either too fast or theyre not used to say chemistry language  they werent taught that when they were being taught English. an assembly member asked how the mandate to have transcriptions would be enforced PERIOD LSA junior Annie Mintun clarified that the transcription tool is already available to professors and said it would be optional for classes discussing sensitive material PERIOD

The language and the resolution is in situations where the professor or student feels content discussed is sensitive or should otherwise not have the ability to be shared Mintun said PERIOD It is at the professors discretion to turn off these services. the Assembly referred the resolution to the communications committee PERIOD

Later in the meeting LSA senior Taylor Lansey chair of SOFC gave a report on the SOFC Summer  data and Rackham student Hayden Jackson discussed the funding schedule PERIOD

Due to the virtual semester funding requests to SOFC have decreased significantly compared to previous years PERIOD SOFC granted less than half of their requests with . funds granted out of . requested for the Fall semester PERIOD

Rackham student Austin Glass CSG student general counsel proposed to amend the report to add one more week before the SOFC funding deadline saying he thinks it should extend to the end of the semester PERIOD

My concern is that the final application deadline for the final wave in this schedule is March  when classes and exams extend until the end of the month of April in next semesters calendar Glass said PERIOD It feels awkward to me and uncomfortable to me and I hope that you will amend the schedule. the Assembly did not approve the amendment PERIOD

Jackson said he preferred to pass the funding schedule as originally written due to concerns about the deadline overlapping with final exams PERIOD The receipt deadline is the last date to be able to postmark any receipts used for funding projects PERIOD

Theres a problem if you push forward the application deadline but dont push forward the receipt deadline Jackson said PERIOD Then that leaves organizations only a week to submit receipts when they normally have two weeks to submit receipts or  moves the receipt deadline into finals week. sOFC funding schedule criteria and membership questions were approved PERIOD Funding for the Office of MultiEthnic Student Affairs to use towards the Black History Month speakers was also approved PERIOD

LSA senior Soneida Rodriguez was also appointed to the Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Survivor Empowerment Commission PERIOD
