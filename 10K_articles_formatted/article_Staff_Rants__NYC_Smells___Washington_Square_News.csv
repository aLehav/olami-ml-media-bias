Melanie Pineda Opinion Editor

There are much worse smells in New York than juuls but none quite as obnoxious PERIOD This rant goes out to every single one of you angsty  Tumblrera kids that stand outside of Bobst all day rather than I dont know going to class PERIOD Or calling your mom PERIOD Or doing literally anything else PERIOD Yes I know this is going to make me sound like a grandma but after three years at this school enough is enough PERIOD I get that your mangoflavored juul is one of  if not the most  important thing in your life right now and juuling by Bobst fills some sort of weird aesthetic for yall but that doesnt mean you have to constantly blow your vapor in my face PERIOD Do what you want in your free time but please do so at least three feet away from me PERIOD

On Sewer Sludge
Hannah Khosravi Opinion Editor

Last fall we all experienced an onslaught of heavy inundating rain PERIOD It was the kind of manversusumbrella rain that soaks through your soul rendering you helpless and shaky and waterlogged by the time you get to your class at  Mercer St PERIOD On one of these gloomy afternoons I ran into my apartment threw my umbrella down in the corner and went to dry my hair in the bathroom PERIOD As I went down the stairs of my duplex I saw a puddle of water creeping out from under my roommates door PERIOD Was it a leak Nope PERIOD Turns out the sewer lines under our building had exploded thanks to swelling from the rainstorm and the water was rising through our floor from beneath the ground PERIOD Within an hour the whole floor was submerged PERIOD And as for my roommates humongous Persian rug We ended up carrying that bad boy soaked through with foulsmelling sewer water into the corridor of our apartment building so that it could be disposed of PERIOD Thanks to sewerrug the entrance and hallway of the building reeked of festering mold PERIOD And for lack of a better description the whole building smelled like literal poop PERIOD The toilet smell percolated until our building manager finally got someone to remove the offending device PERIOD Later that week I had two friends visit  one from California and one from Connecticut PERIOD Explaining why my apartment building smelled like sewage was a long story but I cant imagine a better welcometoNewYork odor than subwayline sewerstink anyway  very New York and only slightly nauseating PERIOD This is city living my friends PERIOD 

Suffice it to say we dont live there anymore PERIOD That however is a story for another day. on Shake Shack Sadness
Bela Kirpalani Deputy Managing Editor

Every time I walk past the Shake Shack on Astor Place my body shudders with disgust PERIOD A hot wave envelopes me filling my nostrils with the smell of cheeseburgers and fried food PERIOD To others this may seem heavenly PERIOD But to me a nonbeef eater and a person who does not particularly enjoy fast food the experience is a foul one PERIOD Due to the combination of heat stink and small bout of nausea it brings me I often try to speed past the burger chain or avoid it altogether on my way to campus PERIOD I fear this confession will garner me unnecessary hate but I felt the need to speak my smelly truth PERIOD Let the hating begin PERIOD

On Humid Garbage Air
Sarah John Deputy Opinion Editor

When I came to NYU in August I thought my first week here might end up being my last as well something about city life seemed unbearable even within those first few days PERIOD Im not talking about the neverending honking and sirens the humidity or the infamous rudeness that so many New Yorkers possess  I was prepared for all those socalled features of the city PERIOD No Im talking about that constant summer feeling of hot moist garbage air moving into my nostrils PERIOD Thats right hot moist garbage air PERIOD All across New York PERIOD Why Why do we let ourselves live like this New York Who hurt us
