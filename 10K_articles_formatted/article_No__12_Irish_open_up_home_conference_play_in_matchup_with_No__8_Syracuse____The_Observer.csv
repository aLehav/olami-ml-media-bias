No PERIOD  Notre Dame will open home conference play Saturday when they host ACCrival and eighthranked Syracuse PERIOD While the Orange   ACC hold the alltime advantage over the Irish    Notre Dame has won three of the last five bouts PERIOD With four of the last six games being decided by only one goal the matchup looks to be primed for fireworks PERIOD The Irish dont shy away from big games either Notre Dame is  against teams ranked in the top  in the USILA Coaches Poll since the beginning of the  season going  against top opponents in  PERIOD Since  the Irish are also  against teams ranked in the top five by the same poll PERIOD

Notre Dame started the season with three wins out of four including big victories over thenNo PERIOD  Maryland and thenNo PERIOD  Denver but the Irish have stumbled as of late losing two of their last three games including last weekends overtime loss to Ohio State in the Arlotta Stadium opener PERIOD

A key strength for head coach Kevin Corrigan so far has been depth particularly on the offensive end PERIOD Notre Dame currently has five players with over  points on the year PERIOD Their scoring efforts have been led by junior midfielder Bryan Costabile who has notched  goals and two assists on the season junior attacker Brian Willetts who has  goals and three assists and senior midfielder Brendan Gleason who has  goals and eight assists PERIOD Further in his first season as a starter Wheaton Jackoboice has come on strong for Notre Dame PERIOD The sophomore midfielder has  points on the season off of nine goals and eight assists and has posted at least three points in each of his last four games with his most notable performance coming in a twogoal twoassist performance against Virginia PERIOD

On the defensive side the Irish have a wealth of experience in seniors Hugh Crance and Drew Schantz PERIOD But so far much of the show has been stolen by sophomore defenseman Arden Cohen who leads the team with  caused turnovers and is second on the team with  ground balls PERIOD Cohen had a seasonbest three forced turnovers last weekend against the Buckeyes and he also scooped up six ground balls and led two key plays at the end to keep the Irish in the game PERIOD Overall the Irish have caused  turnovers so far this season and are holding opponents to . goals per game PERIOD

While the team is still working out particular kinks as conference play starts to heat up an area where Notre Dame has already been hitting top gear is during the second quarter  far and away the programs strongest statistical quarter to date PERIOD Over seven games the Irish have dominated with a  scoring margin only allowing more than one goal once PERIOD But for the team to remain consistent much of the work has to be done on the faceoff where junior Charlie Leonards work ethic has been lauded by Corrigan PERIOD

Of Syracuses seven overall games six have been against opponents ranked  at the time  in the top  PERIOD The Orange enter the contest against the Irish fresh off of a thrilling  overtime victory over thenNo PERIOD  Duke and a victory which extended their win streak to three PERIOD Bradley Voigt will be the player to watch for Syracuse as the senior attacker leads the team in points with  off of  goals and  assists PERIOD
