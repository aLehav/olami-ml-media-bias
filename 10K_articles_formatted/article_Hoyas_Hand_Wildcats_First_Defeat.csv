An aggressive Villanova team was no match for Georgetown Friday as the Hoyas bested the Wildcats  in their Big East opener PERIOD

The blowout was only the second time that Georgetown has come out on top in the past  matchups against Nova as well as the first time in four years that the Hoyas have won their conferenceopener PERIOD The Hoyas dealt the Wildcats their first loss of the season ending their sevengame winning streak PERIOD Georgetown improved to  on the year after the win PERIOD

Junior forward Toni Marie Hudson was again a standout in Friday afternoons game scoring two goals for the Hoyas and bringing her season total to a teamleading seven scores PERIOD

Tonis always been a player capable of doing what shes doing Head Coach Dave Nolan said PERIOD She is starting to show some of the potential we had hoped for PERIOD Her general play has improved a lot PERIOD She defends from up front creates chances shes brave strong and fast  PERIOD the light bulb has finally gone off. hudson and the rest of the offensive lineup wasted no time in attacking the Wildcats defensive unit PERIOD Not even  minutes into the first half the Hoyas seized an offensive opportunity when freshman midfielder Kelly DAmbrisi passed off to sophomore midfielder Caitlin Durkee in the thick of the Villanova defense PERIOD Durkee dished a pass off across the box to Hudson who flipped a shot into the goal with her back to the Wildcat goaltender junior Molly Williams PERIOD

The Hoya offense continued to penetrate Wildcat territory as the first half wore on with Durkee banging a close one off the goalposts and an attempt by junior defender Norah Swanson missing over the top of the goal PERIOD Despite the offensive attack Villanova found some opportunity to score as well PERIOD Nova drew four corner kicks in the first half and had one direct header at the Hoya goalposts but the shot was denied by a quick save from sophomore goaltender Jackie DesJardin PERIOD While the Wildcats kept the ball on the Hoyas side of the field for the waning minutes of the first half the Hoya defense led by sophomore Michaela Buonomo freshman Gabby Miller senior Laura Snyder and Swanson kept them from finding the back of the net PERIOD

Villanova with one of the highestscoring offenses in the Big East continued to pressure the Hoyas in the second half but Georgetowns defense showed new strength as it continually denied the Wildcats advances PERIOD

The back four were great on Friday Nolan said PERIOD Particularly Gabby who was playing in her first Big East game PERIOD Our whole team was great defensively PERIOD Everyone contributed. the defenses strong play also resulted in some offensive opportunities for the Hoyas PERIOD When DesJardin made a save late in the second half the Wildcat defense found themselves unready for the Hoyas counter attack PERIOD The scuffle led to a throwin for freshman Samantha Baker a lofted pass that found Hudson who drilled in her second goal of the game PERIOD

inutes later another long throw from Baker found DAmbrisi in front of the Wildcats goalposts and the freshman kicked one past Williams for the Hoyas third goal of the contest and DAmbrisis first score of the season PERIOD

Georgetown  Penn 

Coming off of the stellar performance on Friday afternoon the Hoyas faced the Pennsylvania Quakers on Sunday at North Kehoe Field PERIOD The flawless play the Hoyas showed on Friday seemed to be missing in the start of Sundays game PERIOD

I understand exactly what our kids were going through Nolan said PERIOD After the big conference game on Friday it was difficult to switch hats and play with the same intensity in a nonconference game. barely  minutes into the game Penn penetrated the Georgetown defense and worked a goal past DesJardin and the rest of her defenders to put the Quakers up  PERIOD Twenty minutes later after several offensive attempts from Georgetown missed their marks the Hoya defense was broken again as Penn scored its second goal of the game PERIOD

But the Hoyas were not going to let their undefeated record be taken away without a fight PERIOD DesJardin made several wellexecuted saves to keep the Quakers from running up the score in the second half and Georgetown finally capitalized on some offensive chances in the closing minutes PERIOD In the seventy-seventh minute another long throwin across the box from Baker found senior Nicole Smith who rifled a shot past the Quaker goaltender for her first goal of the season slicing the Penn lead in half PERIOD

Only minutes after that score a pass from downfield connected with the arm of a Penn defender and the Hoyas were awarded a muchneeded penalty kick PERIOD Hudson took the shot and blew one by the Quaker goalie to tie the game up  PERIOD

Despite half a dozen corner kicks in the final minutes of the game the Hoyas were unable to get another goal on the scoreboard so the game headed into overtime PERIOD The Hoyas could not convert six corner kick tries during the extra frame so the game ended in a draw bringing Georgetowns season record to  PERIOD

Two Georgetown players were recognized by the Big East for their impressive weekend performances Freshman Samantha Baker was named to the Big East Honor Roll and Toni Marie Hudson was honored as the Big East Offensive Player of the Week PERIOD

Georgetown next heads to Seton Hall for their second Big East game of the season on Friday with a  p.m PERIOD kickoff PERIOD
