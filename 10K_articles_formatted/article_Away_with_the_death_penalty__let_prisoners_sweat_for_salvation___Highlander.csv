California hasnt executed anyone in nine years and a certain prodeath penalty group has waited long enough PERIOD They recently proposed a ballot extending prison labor to inmates on death row as well as provided new deadlines for the appeals process PERIOD Evidently the latter is meant to expedite executions in California while the former is probably just to make sure theyre not having too much fun chilling in solitary confinement PERIOD Life in a small windowless concrete cage is too luxurious apparently PERIOD

An antideath penalty measure has been proposed in opposition which also requires inmates to work PERIOD However instead of ultimately being executed they are simply sentenced to life without parole PERIOD

In both proposals the inmates earnings would go to the families of those they have harmed PERIOD Californians will be able to vote on either one of the measures on the November  ballot PERIOD

Personally I believe that our entire prison system needs reform but in regards to these measures I prefer the lesser of the two evils antideath life without parole and requirement to pay restitution PERIOD

From issues like overcrowding and unsanitary living conditions it is evident that prison life is deplorable PERIOD Instead of focusing on reform and rehabilitation for these misguided individuals we have a justice system centered on retribution and punishment PERIOD Yes these people are criminals and have committed grave wrongdoings  but are they not people as well Cant they be considered as victims of circumstance

Granted theyve committed crimes so heinous that people can justify exterminating them completely PERIOD Advocates of the death penalty argue that by taking the life of another person murderers have surrendered their own right to live PERIOD Also by executing these murderers the victims families are given necessary closure PERIOD

Such a mentality is dangerous because it justifies killing in the name of justice  it implies that murder is okay in certain circumstances PERIOD This only promotes violence and vengeance PERIOD Furthermore prisoners are usually on death row for years before finally being assigned an execution date PERIOD The familys grieving is prolonged and they are trapped in the shadow of tragedy until justice is served. this is especially true for the  criminals on Californias death row PERIOD Californias last execution was in  and it has only executed  inmates since it reinstated capital punishment in  PERIOD Uncertainty surrounding the constitutionality of the threedrug execution method along with inadequate representation and overall inefficiency of the appeal system has delayed the demise of these inmates and has ultimately delayed closure for their victims families PERIOD

Admittedly having hundreds of inmates living on death row is not ideal PERIOD It is already difficult to accommodate them as it is and providing for them no matter how miserable the conditions is expensive PERIOD Many of them either commit suicide or die of illnesses PERIOD

If the antideath measure passes inmates will have the opportunity to be productive and offer monetary compensation for their crime PERIOD Its true that a persons life is priceless but money has a higher value than sentiment PERIOD Especially since the prisoners hardly have much of a life in prison anyway executing them just puts them out of their misery PERIOD If vengeance is the persuasion behind capital punishment then the idea that victims are reaping the fruits of the perpetrators labor should elicit some twisted satisfaction PERIOD

The prodeath measure is simply cruel  it requires people already sentenced to death to participate in labor PERIOD Its like rubbing salt on an open wound PERIOD Also the value of their work might be lousy since they figure that theyre going to die anyways PERIOD

At least without the death penalty looming over them theres a chance of redemption PERIOD Since the inmates earnings will go directly to the victims family theres a higher sense of accountability and obligation PERIOD Every day is a physical reminder of their wrongdoing and though it would never be completely rectified its still an opportunity to show remorse PERIOD

Though the antideath measure would still require murderers to be incarcerated for life it would still make our justice system appear more forgiving PERIOD Allowing them to work and compensate for their crime as opposed to disposing of them might just be the first step to a more tolerant society PERIOD
