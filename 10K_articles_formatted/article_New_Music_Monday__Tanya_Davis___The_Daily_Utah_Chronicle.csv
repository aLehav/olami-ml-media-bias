If youre like me you love discovering new artists PERIOD When I find a band with a fresh sound innovative ideas and a whole discography to discover I feel like a little kid on Christmas morning PERIOD And as much as I love discovering new music I also love to share my music with others in the hope that they will enjoy it as much as I have PERIOD

That said this is the first of many New Music Mondays where I and other Chronicle and KUTE writers will share some of our favorite artists that you might not have heard of before PERIOD

Todays featured artist is Canadian singersongwriterpoet Tanya Davis PERIOD I first heard her last month on . kRCL a great station if youre looking to discover a wide variety of new music by the way PERIOD They were playing her song How to be Alone a beautiful anthem for the life of any introvert PERIOD



It begins as more of a spoken word performance than a song as she describes the daytoday attitudes of someone who prefers to be alone PERIOD A harmonica and eventually an electric guitar are eventually introduced but thats about all the instrumentation there is PERIOD The minimalist aesthetic is effective as it lets her poetic voice and her soothing childlike voice shine through PERIOD

As I searched for more of her music I came across a song called Art an ode to art itself PERIOD Art art I want you she sings Art you make it pretty hard not to PERIOD And my heart is trying hard here to follow you  This song has a bit more instrumentation including a small childrens choir that accompanies her on a chorus that is pretty dang catchy PERIOD



Tanya Davis proves shes a versatile performer with her most recent fulllength album Clocks and Hearts Keep Going from  PERIOD She retains her spoken word roots on several songs but also showcases her ability as contemporary singersongwriter on songs like Sad Secret. one of the most amazing things about Tanya Davis is how small her following is PERIOD The above video for Sad Secret had a total of three views at the time of my writing this PERIOD And her twitter account tanyadavismusic has just over three thousand followers PERIOD An artist of her caliber deserves a lot more recognition than she has so if youve enjoyed these songs give her a follow and check out more of her music on YouTube or Spotify PERIOD Shes also on iTunes if you decide like me to buy some of her wonderful music PERIOD
