4171,2002-11-12,"james Taylor once said Ive seen fire and Ive seen rain. but if he lived in Santa Barbara instead of fire hed now likely be seeing rain and tainted shellfish PERIOD

Santa Barbara County Fire Dept PERIOD Capt PERIOD Charlie Johnson said the amount of rain that fell this weekend was more than the minimum necessary to declare the  fire season officially over PERIOD

As a cautionary measure we usually need two inches of rain before the fire dept. can say the fire season is over with Johnson said PERIOD

Although the fire department has announced the end of fire season prematurely in past years Johnson said his department would likely make a statement regarding the end of fire season sometime tomorrow PERIOD

Once before we said it was over and then we didnt get any rain for weeks so well see about that he said PERIOD

According to the National Weather Service various areas of the county received about . inches of rain PERIOD Johnson said a precipitation measurement station on Los Carneros Road  the station nearest Isla Vista  measured slightly more than two inches of rainfall this weekend PERIOD

Ending fire season means the fire dept PERIOD can lower the level of available responding units Johnson said PERIOD These changes include the elimination of seasonal Department of Forestry and Fire Protection employees and the removal of bulldozer and helicopter units from standby fire response PERIOD

We take our vehicles in for maintenance too Johnson said PERIOD Now is when we can take care of these things before the fire season begins again in May. on Friday Andrea E PERIOD Tuttle Department of Forestry and Fire Protection director issued a statement lifting the countys ban on burning PERIOD Under normal circumstances residents of Santa Barbara County may apply for a permit to burn materials such as leaves or grass clippings on their property PERIOD During the fire season however such burning is banned due to the risk of the fire becoming out of control PERIOD

In addition to dousing the risk of fire the past weekend also changed the state of local seawater PERIOD On Friday Santa Barbara County Environmental Health Services issued a runoff advisory PERIOD According to a statement from Peggy Langle director of Santa Barbara County Environmental Health Services the first significant rain after a lengthy dry period is likely to contain high levels of pollutants PERIOD

People swimming or surfing in water within three days of the rain could exhibit rashes fever chills ear infections vomiting and diarrhea  all of which are potentially symptoms of serious illnesses like gastroenteritis salmonellosis or hepatitis PERIOD

If people choose to swim in the ocean the department encourages them to swim away from discolored water and drainpipes and creeks through which runoff enters the ocean PERIOD

People are also discouraged from eating shellfish between four and  days after the rain as shellfish may contain levels of bacteria pesticides herbicides and oil that even thorough cooking will not eliminate PERIOD

The most recent beach status report stated that as recently as Nov PERIOD  all county beaches were currently open PERIOD However Carpinteria State Beach Leadbetter Beach  El Capitan State Beach Arroyo Quemada and Guadalupe Dunes Beach are each presently in a state of warning because samples indicated higher than normal levels of colliform or enterococcus bacteria PERIOD
