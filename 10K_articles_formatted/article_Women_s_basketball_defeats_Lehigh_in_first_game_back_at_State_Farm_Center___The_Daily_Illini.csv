Despite its strong defensive play Illinois found itself up by only three points at halftime against Lehigh on SundayRB PERIOD Then Kyley Simmons started to find a rhythm and finished the game with  points  all of which came from behind the arcRB PERIOD

The senior guard credited her teammates for getting her open looks late in the game PERIOD

Chatrice White sets those awesome screens for me and when you have a big girl that can set those screens and also be a threat inside and outside for you it just really opens up a lot more for me Simmons said PERIOD I got in the gym shot with coach after the Miami game and just believed. from the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

Illinois shot  percent from the fieldRB PERIOD White scored 17RB points and freshman guard Cierra Rice added 12RB PERIOD

White said when Simmons starts to get going offensively the team is affected on both sides of the court PERIOD

Its great for us in transitioning into defense and were ready to get a stop White said PERIOD Then were ready to get into it. on the other side of the ball the Illini shut down Lehighs top scorer Lexi Martins limiting her to three points in the first half and  overall on 4of11 shootingRB PERIOD Illinois head coach Matt Bollant said limiting Martins and Quinci Manns  another one of Lehighs top contributors  impact was key for his team PERIOD

We knew those two post players were their leading scorers and theyre good players and they played like it today Bollant said of Martins and Mann PERIOD They combined for  points and  rebounds. a big reason for Illinois defensive stand in the second half was the play of freshman Alex Wittinger who finished with six rebounds and a careerbest six blocksRB PERIOD

I dont think that theyve seen any girls that can jump and grab the rim like Alex can Bollant said PERIOD Her length and athleticism I think made a difference for us. the win was the programs first win in the newly renovated State Farm CenterRB  its first set of home games were played at Parkland CollegeRB PERIOD

I think they were kind of over excited and think that kind of takes your energy PERIOD We didnt quite seem to have the same life to start that game Bollant said PERIOD I think the players love it PERIOD Its just an adjustment coming back here after not being here PERIOD We only practiced here Friday and Saturday for the first time. simmons seven 3pointers tied a State Farm Center record set by Amber Moore in 2011RB PERIOD
