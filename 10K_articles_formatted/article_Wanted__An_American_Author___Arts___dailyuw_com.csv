Wanted An American Author Paula Gilovich Daily Staff

John Updike touched the back of his gray hair with his large hand and then grabbed the podium PERIOD He was reluctant and shy and told us he was going to do his best to get through this so that he could get to the signing PERIOD I wanted him to relax PERIOD I was there to sit with his words PERIOD But Updike is an author so large he may have forgotten that his words are more important than his signature.His reading at First United Methodist Church last Thursday celebrated four of Updikes most wellknown novels Rabbit Run  Rabbit Redux  Rabbit is Rich  and Rabbit at Rest  which have been compiled by Knopf into one binding and entitled Rabbit Angstrom The Four Novels PERIOD Updike held the volume of biblical size PERIOD  he said PERIOD He believes there should be ten years in between each book to parallel the time it took to write them PERIOD He admits to the history within his pages PERIOD And although he stood at the head of a church giving what looked like a sermon he is much simpler than all that.Updike in no way pontificated on his ideas PERIOD He stood as a part of us not above us presenting his words as documentation of what has happened PERIOD And to be at his reading was to witness the chronicle of the last half of 20thcentury American history PERIOD I disagree with him I dont think that the set should be read over his suggested intervals especially if youre in your early twenties and going to college PERIOD I say read it straight PERIOD You might find his books telling you where you are while providing a necessary history to your own life.John Updikes mother wanted to be a writer PERIOD So growing up in simple poor Pennsylvania during the thirties he thought it viable to spend time writing PERIOD Forty books later it seems as though in his  he was raised on words as though they were milk.Now one of the most prolific writers of our American history Updike with his continuous relationship with The New Yorker and his continuous relationship with his publisher Knopf has covered all writing ground PERIOD Hes told children stories interviewed other writers written social commentary and of course written forty books with a new one out this January entitled In the Beauty of the Lilies.But the reason why Updike is so important to us is that he understands America PERIOD He cant help but physically represent what has dominated the last several decades of our beloved USA PERIOD He stands as tall white male with an ugly hooked nose and a cliche striped tie PERIOD And in that he is all that is endearing and sick about our country.Within the life of Harry  Angstrom the main character of this now massive book are the truths behind all closed American doors PERIOD Updike readily admits that Rabbit was  He describes Rabbit as  with  With a character like that whose existence he stretched most of his own life Updike was able to investigate what he calls  Rabbit is a classic misanthrope whose only use for other people is his own realization PERIOD So as we read Rabbit we see him trip and feel the tragedy inherent in our American clumsiness.Updike doesnt hide parallels between himself and his character PERIOD  he said PERIOD  And he defines the disease of America anonymity PERIOD For John Updike at the heart of this is the anonymous existence within the family PERIOD A father in an Updike story is as anonymous to a son as any passing stranger.The author ended his reading by taking a book of his poems from an audience member and reading a few sonnets PERIOD He uses them as  as he travels and reads across America PERIOD He takes them  for himself each sonnet depicting another American scene PERIOD He read    And you could hear the attempt somewhere between the words to define this country PERIOD But what is inevitably felt by Updikes poetry is that an America we thought was so thoroughly invented is not invented at all.John Updike walked off stage and everyone grabbed their hardcovers and got in line PERIOD As I walked out I watched everyone struggling to hold their books with Updike struggling to hold his pen PERIOD And I with guilt hoped that he would stand more erect with a little bit of  in him and run PERIOD
