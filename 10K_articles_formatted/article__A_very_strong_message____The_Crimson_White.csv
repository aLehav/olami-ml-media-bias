News of the cancelation broke after Assistant Dean of Students Lowell Davis announced the Universitys decision to a group of IFC fraternity presidents at  p.m PERIOD Davis told the students pledges had to be out of pledge gear and all pledge activities were to cease by  p.m PERIOD

There is a new day at the University of Alabama a new president and we cannot allow the things that have possibly taken place in the past to continue to happen Davis said PERIOD

Vice President for Student Affairs Mark Nelson spoke to press later in the afternoon and said calls made to the hazing hot line over the past week prompted the suspension PERIOD

It is very difficult to investigate cases of hazing that are reported through anonymous sources that are vague Nelson said PERIOD The sources that have come in this week have been very specific and have enabled us to take swifter action. temporary suspension

Though Thursdays actions were the first taken against entire chapters allegations of pledge hazing have plagued the University for at least the last month PERIOD

On Sept PERIOD  Gillan President Guy Bailey and others received an anonymous email claiming to be sent on behalf of fraternity and sorority pledges PERIOD The email requested an overhaul of the pledge process PERIOD

We represent a group of freshman men and women that are the subject of physical hazing sleep deprivation and excessive alcohol consumption that is occurring under your stewardship of the program the authors stated in the email PERIOD The time requirement of these young men and women at the houses is too much and contributes to the aforementioned abuses that are occurring. on Sept PERIOD  The Crimson White approached the University for comment on possible hazing violations or pledgeship cancellation PERIOD Dean of Students Tim Hebson emailed a statement via a university spokeswoman PERIOD

A few pledge classes were suspended temporarily while we investigated allegations of hazing and identified the individuals involved Hebson said in the statement PERIOD Individuals who violated the Code of Student Conduct are being dealt with appropriately PERIOD Thus far no fraternities have been found responsible for hazing only individuals were involved and it was not a chapter action. no pledge classes have been cancelled and the University has not threatened to cancel all new member programs he said PERIOD

Later that day Hebson announced a temporary suspension of pledgeship effective Oct PERIOD  to allow students time off to travel home for fall break and study for midterms PERIOD An anonymous author forwarded the email to The Crimson White on Oct PERIOD  stating that the authors found the week long suspension insufficient due to significant hospitalizations and other infractions. in an emailed statement Hebson denied that the letter had anything to do with the first suspension of pledgeship PERIOD

That letter doesnt mention any specific highrisk behavior that would make us say that we have to suspend pledgeship because of behavior issues Hebson said PERIOD I feel really really good about where we are PERIOD The University is moving in a very positive direction. university investigation

After Davis announcement Thursday the University emailed a press release outlining the investigations of several IFC fraternities PERIOD

According to the release Pi Kappa Alpha and Delta Tau Deltas block seating privileges were revoked and both houses must meet with Judicial Affairs PERIOD The University also issued interim suspensions to two active members of Pi Kappa Alpha and one former member PERIOD The national organizations for Pi Kappa Alpha and Chi Phi issued cease and desist communications to the UA chapters PERIOD

The release also states that the University would immediately begin an investigation into Theta Chi following a complaint PERIOD

Jake Morrow a UA senior and rush chair for DKE said Thursday that he doesnt understand why pledgeship was canceled PERIOD

Ive also heard that the hazing hot line is anonymous PERIOD Anyone could call the hazing hot line it doesnt have to be a Greek member PERIOD I dont see how that gives them credibility to say anything on the hazing hot line Morrow said following Nelsons press conference PERIOD Im not upset about not having pledge ship for my sake but Im upset for the pledges PERIOD pledgeship is basically a way to get the pledge class together have a brotherhood  I feel like its a little ridiculous that theyre taking that away from them. morrow said DKE uses pledgeship as a time to teach pledges about the history of the house and to build a brotherhood between them and the actives PERIOD He feels the cancellation will have a negative impact on the University PERIOD

At least have pledgeship next year if they want to suspend it for the rest of this year he said PERIOD I know my new boys want to sign a letter saying they want to do pledgeship anyway PERIOD I know there are a lot of parents who still want them to go through pledgeship a lot of alumni that really want them to go through pledgeship as well as me and my fraternity brothers. davis said Nelsons decision to end pledgeship is final but that Student and Greek Affairs will convene a group of individuals to decide what pledge programs will look like next year PERIOD

Nelson also said the University was ready to take extreme measures against IFC fraternities that continued pledgeship underground or retaliated against their pledges PERIOD

Weve made it very clear and sent a very strong message that retaliation will not be tolerated Nelson said PERIOD Any retaliation will be met with the full force of the University. davis has encouraged all the fraternities to begin initiations as soon as possible and said that initiations can be conducted in chapter houses but an adviser must be present during all ritual events PERIOD He also urged fraternity members to respect the final decision of the UA administration PERIOD

No hell week is to take place and I quote if hell week does take place there will be hell to pay from the University of Alabama Davis said PERIOD So please understand that we take any allegation seriously and that we will not continue to let anything happen as it revolves around pledgeship here at the University of Alabama.",‘A very strong message’ – The Crimson White,University of Alabama
