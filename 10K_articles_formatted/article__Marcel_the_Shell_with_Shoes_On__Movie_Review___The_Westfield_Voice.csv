Nathan Crane  Staff WriterMarch  

At its coreMarcel the Shell with Shoes On is an emotional film with a lot of heart to it PERIOD While it is maybe more of a documentary than a fictional film it has fictional and animated elements that bring the waterworks PERIOD The focus on the little shell creatures that make up the cast are adorable but have emotional arcs of their own PERIOD Marcel is a compelling protagonist and the journey he goes on tugs the heartstrings PERIOD

Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is about Marcel the small shelllike character who has a documentary made about him PERIOD The documentary within the film explores him how he lost his family and his mental struggles PERIOD The rest of the film follows a mockumentary format as we learn more about him as he tries to find his missing family. chock full of emotion and hilarity Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is fantastic PERIOD

The stop motion of the movie makes the audience think that Marcel is real PERIOD Thats one of my favorite parts about Marcel PERIOD Dean Fleischer Camp the director being a character in his own movie adds to this as we can imagine him talking to Marcel in real life PERIOD The cast and creatures put a lot of themselves into this and I recommend it for fans of stop motion animation and indie films PERIOD
