3720,2019-08-06,"the last time new Boston College football offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian was coaching at the college level he was with Tennessee back in  overseeing an offense that saw just  percent of its receptions come from the tight end position PERIOD

Triple that number and youll be just a little bit over the percentage of passes caught by Eagles tight ends in  . percent PERIOD Led by Tommy Sweeney who is catching on with the NFLs Buffalo Bills BC had one of the more capable tight end units in the country PERIOD The group combined for  yards and eight touchdowns a healthy output on a runfirst team PERIOD

The difference between the two offenses is easily traceable PERIOD In his first college stint Bajakianwho spoke to reporters on Tuesday afternoon at BCs media daydescribed his approach as an up tempo no huddle spread scheme operating from the gun using four wide receiver sets and spreading the field out laterally. the Eagles under sincedeparted Scott Loeffler played with speed in  but leaned on bigger packages making the most of a deep tight end room PERIOD

Dont expect BC to dramatically change its offense in  though PERIOD All you need to look at is what Bajakian learned when he leapt up to the professional ranks in  PERIOD As the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterbacks coach for four years Bajakian learned under Dirk Koetterwho was the offensive coordinator in  then the head coach the next three seasons PERIOD Tight ends have thrived under Koetter whether its Cameron Brate or Austin SeferianJenkins the last few years PERIOD

I learned a ton about how to utilize tight ends better in an offensive scheme Bajakian said of his time in Florida PERIOD Obviously we had had some good ones in my past  but when I went to Tampa and we had guys like Cameron Brate from Harvard and O.J PERIOD Howard and various other guys I thought Coach Koetter did a great job of using those guys. bajakian while at Tampa Bay got to thinking of how he would incorporate tight ends more if he returned to the college level PERIOD When BC and head coach Steve Addazio came knocking it was a perfect fit PERIOD

When Coach Addazio and I started talking he told me about the depth they had at the tight end position prior to me coming here and how they utilize them he recalled PERIOD I said that was exactly what I wanted to do and it became an easy decision. that bodes well for the Eagles tight end room which took a hit with the departure of Sweeney  receptions  yards three touchdowns but still has plenty of talent PERIOD Two of themgraduate Jake Burt six receptions  yards one touchdown and redshirt sophomore Hunter Long four receptions  yards two touchdownswere named to the preseason John Mackey Award Watch List which is given to the countrys top tight end PERIOD

The rest of the group includes incoming Penn State transfer Danny Dalton who has impressed at training camp thus far established veterans in Korab Idrizi Chris Garrison Ray Marten and several intriguing younger pieces PERIOD

Dillon out of the backfield

A recurring theme of talk around star running back A.J PERIOD Dillons ability is whether or not he can be utilized as a receiving option out of the backfield PERIOD Dillon didnt catch a ball in his freshman seasonwhile racking up  carriesand managed just eight in  games last season PERIOD While a part of that can be chalked up to the Eagles turning to the likes of Travis Levy  receptions in  and Jon Hilliman  in  if Dillon is looking to further boost his NFL Draft stock and his Heisman chances displaying passcatching ability should be high on the todo list PERIOD

Bajakian seems to agree as he emphatically answered a question about the chance to involve Dillon more in the passing game with a yes. i think the philosophy is always the more ways you can get your playmakers the ball you find ways to do it he said PERIOD A.J PERIOD is obviously one of the playmakers PERIOD The more different ways we can get him the ball and get him involved the better. browns accuracy

Another key component of the Eagles offensestarting quarterback Anthony Brownentered camp looking to improve on consistency PERIOD Last season he started hot with  touchdowns and four interceptions in his first five games helping BC to a  start PERIOD The back half didnt treat him as kindly Brown had just eight touchdowns to five interceptions in the last seven games PERIOD As managing editor Andy Backstrom pointed out struggles with consistency were evident on a pergame basis PERIOD Against Florida State Brown started 3of10 with two interceptions but closed the game going 15of26 with  yards and a touchdown PERIOD

Bajakian pointed to accuracy as something Brown has been working on this spring PERIOD The redshirt junior completed . percent of his passes last season good for tenth out of  quarterbacks in the ACC PERIOD

I think more precise ball location can only help in the area of explosiveness and the phrase we use is hey turn those receivers into ball carriers so that they can catch and advance he said PERIOD Thats one area that as I evaluated last years video Anthony I believe had completed a higher percentage of passes than he had ever done before in his career but I thought he could have done a better job of the pinpoint accuracy. featured Image Courtesy of BC Athletics
