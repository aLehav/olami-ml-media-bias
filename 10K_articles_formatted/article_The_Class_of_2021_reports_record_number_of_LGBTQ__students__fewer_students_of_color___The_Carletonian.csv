9049,2023-11-04,"an styleThe Class of  set a record for its proportion of LGBTQ students PERIOD According to data collected through Haven the colleges sexual violence prevention course  percent of firstyears identifies as LGBTQ the highestever proportion for an entering class PERIOD Meanwhile  percent of the class identifies as transgender or gender nonbinary another significant uptick from last year PERIOD

Were seeing a growing diversity in our applicant pool as to how students identify said Dean of Admissions Paul Thiboutot PERIOD He suggested the growing national awareness and influence of the LGBTQ community as one reason why PERIOD Ive been the dean here for  years and if we go back to  I dont think we ever saw a GSA or related group in high school Thiboutot said PERIOD But now I dont think theres a high school in the country that doesnt have one PERIOD Awareness and therefore selfrepresentation has increased as a result of that PERIOD It really has changed even at the high school level PERIOD Theres just greater awareness and growth. additionally Thiboutot mentioned Carletons reputation of strong support networks for LGBTQ students as a potential cause of the uptick PERIOD

Do we go out and say were looking for a lesbian or a gay student No PERIOD But we do make sure our information is available that we let people know of the resources we have here for LGBTQ students Yes yes and yes PERIOD We represent everything we do to serve those students. gender and Sexuality Center Director Laura Haave meanwhile expressed some concerns that her organizations current resources might not be enough to support the many new LGBTQ identifying students PERIOD If we have more students soon who are doing their own stuff and coming to GSC events we may find Clader House currently home to the GSC to be too small PERIOD Its a temporary space its a little out of the way PERIOD We wonder if we have students coming to events at night will this be too small

Nevertheless Haave mentioned that around  percent of the student body as a whole identifies as LGBTQ while another one to two percent identify as gender nonbinary.Often Haave said well have a lower number of firstyear students who are LGBTQidentifying and developmentally its pretty normal for that percentage to increase over a classs time at college PERIOD When I say that about  percent of students identify as LGBTQ and one to two percent identify as gender nonbinary thats for the whole student body so when I see this many already in this class thats a lot thats more than thats been in the past PERIOD To me thats exciting PERIOD Im like oh this is awesome

Haave also expressed excitement about the potential for more LGBTQ community engagement PERIOD I imagine that some of the students who are freshmen now may apply to be GSCAs meaning we may have a really engaged class next year in order to serve the needs of their class PERIOD Im waiting to hear from the Class of  what you all need and what you all think and Im looking forward to finding that out. however as diversity in terms of gender and sexuality increased racial and ethnic diversity decreased from last year to this year PERIOD However in spite of the slight downturn in representation for students of color Interim OIIL Director Brisa Zubia remains optimistic PERIOD Im not hugely concerned when we talk about there being a dip when we talk about domestic students of color representation she said PERIOD Having been a student here back in  the representation we had then both in regards to domestic students of color and international students is very different from what we had now PERIOD Ive seen the commitment that Carleton has had to increasing diversity on campus so this slight dip weve had is not concerning to me at the moment. zubia also mentioned being pleased with growth in the international student population PERIOD The numbers have been increasing steadily due to a strategic plan wed been putting in motion specifically looking at international students. international student representation has risen from  percent in the Class of  to  percent in that of  PERIOD

Thiboutot noted that the percentage of students of color in the Class of  while down from the Class of  was still the second highest ever PERIOD We have to deal with fluctuations from year to year he said PERIOD I have to look longterm if we look long term at the proportion of students of color its on an upswing. he expressed hope that in the near future we can continue approaching  percent students of color. when I think of underrepresented students said Zubia of OIILstudents of color international students what I think of is Is this a safe space Will I have friends Will I be supported

I hope Haave added people see Carleton as a place where students can come and say hey this is a place where I can be my authentic self and find a community. your donation will support the student journalists of Carleton College PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
