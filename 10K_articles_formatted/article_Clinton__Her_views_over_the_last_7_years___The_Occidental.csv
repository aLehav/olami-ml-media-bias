5477,2022-03-16,"seven years ago Hillary Clinton ran against Barack Obama for the Democratic Party nomination PERIOD She lost and Obama went on to win the presidency PERIOD However in that large span of time many of Clintons viewpoints on key Democratic issues have changed causing a significant amount of scrutiny on the accuracy of her viewpoints PERIOD

Marriage

In  neither Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton supported samesex marriage PERIOD For years Clinton had been much slower in comparison to her fellow Democrats in viewing samesex marriage as a constitutional right. in  Clinton argued for civil unions but asserted that the right to marriage was something that should be left to the states. in  her view remained the same PERIOD Yet it appears that Clintons view has changed as a reflection of the trend in popular opinion PERIOD In  according to a Gallup Survey  percent of Americans supported the recognition of samesex marriage while  percent believed it should not be recognized PERIOD In mid2014 the results changed to  percent supporting samesex marriage while  percent were not in favor of it PERIOD

Marijuana

Currently the legalization of marijuana is under continuous debate PERIOD In  according to a Gallup poll  percent of Americans believed that marijuana should be legalized before the  midterm elections PERIOD In  Clinton supported medical research delving into the advantages and potential benefits of marijuana PERIOD

We ought to find what are the elements that claim to be existing in marijuana that might help people who are suffering  I dont think we should decriminalize it Clinton said PERIOD

In later years Clinton labeled marijuana a gateway drug where there cant be a total absence of law enforcement. clinton is hesitant about taking an official stance either for or against the legalization PERIOD CNN foreshadowed this as a potential problem for Clinton as marijuana legalization provided an avenue for some of the only wins for the Democratic Party during the  midterm elections PERIOD

Trade

In  when Bill Clinton was president Hillary Clinton supported the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA PERIOD However in her race for Senate in  and her subsequent run for presidency in  Clinton began to alter her viewpoint PERIOD She said that NAFTA and the way its been implemented has hurt a lot of American workers PERIOD Clearly we have to have a broad reform in how we approach trade. as the Secretary of State during the Obama administration Clinton supported the Passage of Trade Pact as a useful tool in connecting the United States to developing nations PERIOD However it seems that now Clinton has retracted her stances PERIOD Earlier this year Clintons spokesman released a statement that did not take a stance on the issue of trade PERIOD Instead it stated that Clinton preferred to wait and see whether the trade agreement passed a number of barriers that free trade deals were required to meet PERIOD

Drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants

Previously Hillary Clinton was against providing undocumented immigrants with drivers licenses PERIOD However now in  with a majority of her party supporting undocumented immigrants ability to work and live in the United States Clinton has once again altered her stance to support state policies that provide drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants PERIOD

Wall Street reform

Since Hillary Clinton initially ran for President the Democratic Party has become more Populist with liberal leaders wanting to amp up Wall Street reforms and tax top earners PERIOD Unsurprisingly Clinton has altered her viewpoint in accordance with the Democratic viewpoint PERIOD She talks about expanding the middle class and focusing on the needs of the everyday American. however many people doubt her commitment to tax the upperclass individuals because the top three financial institutions fund her Citigroup Inc Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase PERIOD
