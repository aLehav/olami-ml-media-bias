He was pumping gas into his cab PERIOD
She was pausing after getting off a bus on her way to work PERIOD
He was crossing the street PERIOD
Moments otherwise forgettable but for the men and women who met their end from a gunman they couldnt see  that is all we will remember about their lives PERIOD We wont even remember their names PERIOD
It could just as easily have been you or me PERIOD That is what we will remember PERIOD

This last week and a half has brought back the humbling reminder of Sept.  a reminder of a safety taken for granted PERIOD And it begets the question Are we ever truly safe
That question and its ensuing thought processes are visible in President George W PERIOD Bushs push for the removal of Saddam Hussein and possible war with Iraq PERIOD In his speech to the nation onday night President Bush cited Husseins potential for unleashing horrible diseases gases and atomic weapons on us all PERIOD
While I hope that we do depose Hussein from power  exactly for the reasons President Bush has cited  we must remember that Hussein and his threats are rare they are known PERIOD To a degree they are even expected PERIOD Bullets fired at pedestrians or airplanes crashing into office buildings are not so PERIOD
Indeed the world today presents a strong argument in favor of locking our doors drawing our shades and hiding under our beds PERIOD With so much to be afraid of out there its tempting to just lay low and wait out the storm hoping for a day when there are no longer sociopaths with rifles or terrorists with weapons of mass destruction PERIOD To be sure that is our natural instinct  duck and cover and do not uncover until you are sure the coast is clear PERIOD
If ever our natural instincts have been wrong about something they are wrong about this PERIOD
Some extol the virtues of hiding and locking  of bolting our doors or in some cases locking all residence hall doors but one in an effort to better guarantee security PERIOD That provides nothing more than a hollow stopgap to an everpresent concern PERIOD
The fears that haunt us today will never go away PERIOD The actors may change the plot may twist but the story will endure PERIOD The question is will we Are we a society of Chicken Littles
I assert that safety is not based on a lock a can of Mace or even yes my fellow Republicans a national missile defense shield PERIOD Rather safety hinges on something more innate something that we run the very real risk of forgetting in this age of bolts bars and bureaucracy PERIOD
Our ability to think clearly about the troubles that surround us to make rational decisions about the options open to us and to behave in a reasoned thoughtful manner is all that matters when our security blanket of normalcy is ripped away from us PERIOD Lets call it tempered courage PERIOD
I remember years back when my family was robbed while on vacation PERIOD I was a little Adam I remember walking to the airport on the way home looking about as angry as a 9yearold could muster hoping the individual who stole our video camera would show his face PERIOD I had a choice to make I could either stay holed up in my house never giving the world a chance to hurt me again or I could work at internalizing an attitude of tempered courage PERIOD
We should use this time of postdisaster and depending on who you ask prewar to examine our own abilities of crisis management PERIOD Not our governments not Gov PERIOD Tom Ridges colorcoded threatometer  but our own PERIOD Are we a people who are now more content trusting in government and society at large to provide for us Or even worse are we a people who will interrupt our daily lives for fear of the unknown Are we all living in a suspended panic
On Monday there was another shooting but this time at a aryland middle school PERIOD And on Tuesday one must wonder how many parents decided not to send their children to school PERIOD How many parents opted for the hide and lock approach How many parents are more content with bolting the door on the world than being concerned that their children are emotionally equipped to deal with tragedy or fear What kind of lesson does that communicate
If you ask me the reality of people growing up without internalized mechanisms to productively handle fear is just as scary as anything Saddam could lob our way PERIOD The worlds a scary place and without a population wearing its armor on the inside it doesnt much matter what is on the outside PERIOD
