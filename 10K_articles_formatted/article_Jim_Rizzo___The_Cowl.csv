I would like to thank The Cowl news staff writer Peter Mazzella  for bringing attention to issue of WiFi dead zones in some of our residence halls AQ Blues Residents Connecting Over Shared WiFi Issues in the Oct PERIOD  issue of The Cowl PERIOD The Information Technology Department strives to achieve strong coverage in all areas of the residence halls on campus PERIOD However due to some older construction and a variety of materials used which can impact WiFi signal it can be difficult for us to be sure that we have enough access points in a location until students are on campus and all of their devices have attempted to connect to the wireless networks PERIOD

When Peter initially reached out to us it was the first we had heard of any issues with wireless coverage in the residence halls PERIOD Without his initial contact we would not have known that there were areas in Aquinas that lacked sufficient wireless coverage PERIOD The Help Desk takes all complaints about the technology services on campus seriously and we look to ensure that all issues are resolved in a timely manner so that students faculty and staff are able to complete their work PERIOD

As Peter mentioned in his article we at the Help Desk both encourage and welcome all members of the college community to contact us whenever there is an issue with our technology services PERIOD We can be reached by phone at 401865HELP  by email at helpdeskprovidence.edu or in person in any of our three locations  Phillips Memorial Library room LL25 Accinno Hall room  Ryan Center room  PERIOD We also have a variety of documentation guides available at the iHelp website httpihelp.providence.edu or httpfriarsprovidence.sharepoint.comihelp PERIOD Our hours can be found on the Help Desk website httpit.providence.eduhelpdesk PERIOD
