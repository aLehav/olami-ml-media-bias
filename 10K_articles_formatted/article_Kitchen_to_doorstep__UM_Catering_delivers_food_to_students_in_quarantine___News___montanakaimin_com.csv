Updated November     pm



University of Montana Catering is in charge of providing food to students living in UM Housing provided quarantine and isolation even if they do not have a meal plan PERIOD

University of Montana Event and Planning Manager Ryan Martin said a notification is sent to him once a student is identified by the Curry Health Center or the Missoula County Health Department as being positive for coronavirus PERIOD He then contacts the student sends them an email that includes a link to fill out with questions about dietary restrictions and place of quarantine PERIOD This information is then sent to Interim Director of UM Dining Byron Drake PERIOD

Once Drake receives the information needed UM Catering gives the student a sevenday box as they enter quarantine PERIOD This box contains a selection of freezer and refrigerator items candy granola chips and other similar items of food PERIOD Along with this sevenday box the student in quarantine receives one hot meal a day that UM Catering delivers to them PERIOD They usually receive this meal between  a.m PERIOD and  p.m PERIOD

UM Catering only provides this service to students housed in University housing PERIOD These places of quarantine are sections of Lewis and Clark Villages University Villages and Aber Hall PERIOD

Drake said that UM Catering follows the same menu for all boxes with the exception of dietary needs such as being vegetarian or gluten free which are prepared separately PERIOD

We follow a set menu so that everyone gets an adequate amount of food Drake said PERIOD

When UM Catering delivers the food to people in quarantine it uses hot holding boxes which are insulated boxes that keep the heat in PERIOD Usually it takes catering approximately three hours to deliver between  and  meals Drake said PERIOD

When a UM Catering employee approaches the quarantined apartment or dorm they send a text to the student notifying them that their food is coming PERIOD The employee then drops it off at the doorstep of the apartment or dorm and leaves accomplishing the nocontact requirement PERIOD

Drake said he started planning for this situation as early as March when COVID19 became an actual threat PERIOD UM Catering delivered a few meals to students in quarantine during part of the  spring semester PERIOD He received feedback from those students and made the necessary adjustments to make the delivery run smoothly PERIOD Drake said he even spent a week and a half eating only the food from the sevenday box to make sure its contents were suitable PERIOD

The biggest challenge that has arisen since the start of this process has been a lack of communication if a student goes into quarantine late into the evening PERIOD If this happens UM Catering does not get a notification until morning PERIOD Martin said as long as the student fills out the link attached to the email that he sends out by  p.m. UM Catering will get notified PERIOD

Drake also said he has to make sure HIPAA rules are being followed which means only the minimal amount of people can know the identity of the students in quarantine PERIOD He addresses this by giving the UM Catering employees only the first names of the students they are delivering food to PERIOD Other than that both Drake and Martin said the process is going smoothly PERIOD

Over the time of when we started we all have worked on improving and getting it better Martin said PERIOD
