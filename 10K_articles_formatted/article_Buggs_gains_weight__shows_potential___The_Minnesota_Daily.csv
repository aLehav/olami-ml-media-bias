Gophers strength and conditioning coach Shaun Brown who was hired in April said players work out on a voluntary fourday schedule in the summer PERIOD Fridays are generally offdays but Buggs uses them to put in extra work PERIOD

I wish I could say it was something topsecret Brown said PERIOD Hes done a great job taking it daybyday and working at it a little bit at a time. head coach Richard Pitino said Buggs has the most upside of anyone on the team PERIOD He said the forward does things in practice that show pro potential. buggs length and athleticism figure to fit well into Pitinos uptempo system PERIOD The Arlington Texas native said he played a similar style in high school and likes running up and down the court PERIOD
