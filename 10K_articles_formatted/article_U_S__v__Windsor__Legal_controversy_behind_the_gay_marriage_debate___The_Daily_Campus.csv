8320,2023-10-25,"last month Texas issued its first legal samesex marriage license  or maybe not PERIOD

There is still debate about the legality of the marriage PERIOD In response to issuing the license Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked the Texas Supreme Court to void the marriage PERIOD

The Court has not ruled on the legality of the marriage but it has ruled that other gay couples cannot marry in Texas PERIOD The fate of the couples marriage is still undecided PERIOD

This debate will likely continue until the U.S PERIOD Supreme Court issues their ruling on gay marriage this summer PERIOD U.S PERIOD v PERIOD Windsor the case that struck down portions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act will likely be a major influence in the Courts decision PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD v PERIOD Windsor opinion contains two different arguments equal protection and federalism PERIOD The equal protection argument would make federal law absolute in the area of marriage PERIOD On the other hand the federalism argument would give states the final say on the definition of marriage PERIOD

The equal protection argument would offer protection to samesex couples under federal law PERIOD Under the Fifth Amendment every citizen could have the right to love and marry whomever they choose  regardless of sex PERIOD Should the Court apply this logic gay marriage could be legalized not only in Texas but across the entire country PERIOD

Meanwhile the federalism argument would offer significant protection the states PERIOD Applying this logic would delegate the definition of marriage to the states allowing each one to decide whether or not samesex couples can be legally married within its borders PERIOD Essentially the current status quo would be unaffected PERIOD

This split in logic in the Windsor decision is most likely due to the ideologically split court PERIOD The case was decided with at  to  vote PERIOD The Court will most likely decide which reasoning will be applied to future samesex marriage cases with its expected ruling this June PERIOD

The Supreme Courts Windsor opinion held two dueling arguments equal protection and federalism PERIOD This June the Court will most likely decide which argument to apply to future gay marriage cases PERIOD If it chooses equal protection its decision could legalize gay marriage across the entire country PERIOD However if it choses federalism each state will have the ability to ban or legalize gay marriage individually PERIOD As for Texas its first gay marriage could be affirmed or dissolved by the Courts decision PERIOD Either way the Court will definitely have the final say on gay marriage this summer PERIOD
