Sophomore Erin Blake was recently elected as the USG Executive Vice President for the  academic year PERIOD

Sophomore Erin Blake a biomedical engineering and computer science double major was recently elected as the Undergraduate Student Government executive vice president for the  academic year PERIOD As part of an ongoing USG QA series The Hullabaloo sat down with Blake about her experiences on campus her plans for the future and her advice for students hoping to get involved PERIOD

Why did you decide to run for USG executive vice president

So Ive actually been a senator for the last two years and I sat on the Constitutional Bylaw Review Committee  thats the committee that the executive vice president is the chair of  One thing that Ive really focused on in my time in USG is trying to make sure that USG has a bigger face on campus and I thought that through executive vice president that would be the perfect opportunity to really increase USGs presence on campus and let students know that we are here for them and that their ideas are whats being brought to the floor and not necessarily our own PERIOD

Can you touch on what experiences youve had on USG or just on campus in general that have prepared you most for the role of executive vice president

So on USG specifically I participated in the Freshman Leadership Program my freshman year which really exposed me to USG and what they do  I sat as senator for the School of Science and Engineering for the last two years  Ive sat on the constitutional bylaw committee and Ive also been very active within the School of Science and Engineering government PERIOD Ive worked as the special events chair which basically coordinated all large events put on by SSE  I worked as secretary for the SSE Honor Society which gave me skills about being organized and taking care of a larger group of people and Ive also held leadership positions as community service director within my sorority  so Im very qualified at maintaining large groups of people and planning events for large groups of people which I think are really important aspects to have as an executive board member within USG PERIOD

As executive vice president for the upcoming year what do you feel are the most significant changes that students can expect to be coming from USG in 

I am really excited because our executive board is working much more towards making USG more open and I guess more reachable for students  We want to make sure that students know that their ideas are being heard PERIOD So one thing that I worked on as a senator this past semester was implementing a new form like a suggestions form that students can fill out saying this is what I want to see changed on campus and then it asks Do you want to be involved on USG to work on a committee and help make this happen and students can choose whether they do or not which Im really excited about. what do you feel like are the most pressing issues on Tulanes campus that USG is planning on addressing in the upcoming year

I think that one thing that seemed to be a very prevalent issue in everyones campaign this year was sexual violence prevention and I think that USG is really looking to tackle this issue by working with our director of student safety who is trying to work with new student orientation about implementing a new program into new student orientation Our vice president of student life is going to have a seat on the Sexual Violence Prevention  Education Coalition which I think will be really awesome because that will give USG the ability to see what are the things students are talking about around campus with regards to sexual violence prevention and education which I think was a big buzzword during our elections so it makes me really happy to see that were actually going to be doing that PERIOD

What advice would you give students who want to get involved in the policymaking processes on USG or who have input theyd like to contribute

My biggest piece of advice would be for students at large to join committees because like I said we have tons of committees PERIOD We have the CBRC which is the committee I am the chair of but we also have Finance Committee and Academic Affairs Committee and the Sustainability Committee and the Student Safety Committees so we have committees that take in all facets of student life and all of those committees have builtin positions for studentatlarge members so students who arent involved in USG whatsoever and just want to understand the policy process or understand USG more PERIOD

Is there anything else you want to add that you think students should be aware of going into the next year

I would just say my personal piece of advice would be that Im really excited about this new executive board and I think we all really care about USG and have really great ideas so dont be afraid to reach out to us PERIOD Ill publicize my email everywhere PERIOD Its emailprotected and I literally respond to emails automatically and I know everyone else on the executive board does too  Im just really excited to see where this goes and dont be afraid to stand up if you have an idea or reach out to one of us because we would love to hear all of the ideas from the students and if you have critiques about USG or what you think we can do better tell us that too because thats all we are here to do is make sure that we serve the students PERIOD
