p PERIOD To the Editor

p PERIOD I recently was shown a column in The Flat Hat that is a veritable howto on performing oral sex on a man PERIOD Such a column serves to highlight a piece of the depraved immoral behavior of some students these days but not much more PERIOD This tasteless content besmirches the intellect of fellow students professors and alumni and it further disgraces the legacy of great thinkers who resided at the College before us PERIOD I am embarrassed for the College and repulsed that this is the discourse going on in The Flat Hat PERIOD We live in an age in which our society suffers from abortion high divorce rates and other social ills PERIOD The columnists writing skills would be better applied and challenged discussing how to maintain healthy longterm relationships and good values PERIOD

p PERIOD Make a difference this fall break

p PERIOD To the Editor

p PERIOD As you make your way over the Industrial Canal westbound into downtown New Orleans you can see in the rearview mirror the famed site of the levee breach PERIOD Written over it in red and white paint is a single word hindsight. the view beyond the levee is nothing more than grass empty lots and streetlights laid in a grid pattern  a spooky memorial to the neighborhood that once stood there PERIOD That was misconception number one before my trip to Louisiana PERIOD The lower ninth ward is not just a hard hit area of the city slow to recover PERIOD Some parts of it are utterly gone PERIOD

p PERIOD I planned a trip to do Habitat for Humanity the week after Labor Day PERIOD I had been to New Orleans a few times when I was younger and adored the culture PERIOD As I walked the streets of the French Quarter and held my breath I found to my delight that its character remained completely intact PERIOD The drag queens who threw me beads were an assurance that The Quarter was still The Quarter PERIOD What storm

p PERIOD But outside the heart of the city a few miles to the east lies St PERIOD Bernard Parish gutted out and struggling to come to life again PERIOD Here the abandoned KMart says it all PERIOD Two years later the storm is an everpresent reality PERIOD Rebuilding is slow contractors and government are equally distrusted and the years that have passed have made very little difference to those just trying to get out of FEMA trailers and back into their houses PERIOD I did not learn this until I stumbled onto the St PERIOD Bernard Project  a nonprofit begun by two people from Washington D.C PERIOD who quit their jobs to come help PERIOD Unlike Habitat which typically builds houses from the ground up the St PERIOD Bernard Project guts out flooded houses clears them of mold and warped studs and rebuilds them with volunteer work PERIOD That was misconception number two the Project has money PERIOD It has United Way and corporate sponsorship PERIOD It often receives donated building supplies PERIOD What it does not always have is volunteers to do the work PERIOD

p PERIOD After Katrina much of the housing in St PERIOD Bernard was lost PERIOD It took weeks for the water to recede fully PERIOD  Perhaps a few houses were livable but most would need a complete restoration and still stand empty today PERIOD The red and white spraypainted Xs scrawled on the doors by rescue squads two years ago remain PERIOD
When I flew to New Orleans I expected to see cranes and trucks fast at work rebuilding the devastated city PERIOD

p PERIOD That was misconception number three PERIOD What I found was a small group of dedicated young volunteers who quit their jobs and now spend  hours a day often six days a week scraping out moldinfested houses hanging drywall or laying kitchen tile PERIOD I came home with a duty to spread the word PERIOD They need help PERIOD Both Habitat and the St PERIOD Bernard Project present opportunities to make a difference in the ninth ward in the Parish or west in the Bayou PERIOD Anyone have fall break plans
