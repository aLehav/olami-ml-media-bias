Outside of McComas Hall the location of one of the gyms on campus Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

As a Virginia Tech student there are a wide variety of locations around campus that are intended to benefit your overall experience here PERIOD Oftentimes students neglect to take advantage of what is available to them either due to a lack of knowledge or a lack of time and effort PERIOD Whether youre an incoming firstyear student or graduating soon the time to familiarize yourself with everything around you is now PERIOD While we dont know how many of these amenities will be open to the public yet due to COVID policies here are some to take advantage of if theyre open PERIOD

If youre looking to get or stay in shape or maybe just have some recreational fun with friends Virginia Tech has two oncampus gyms that are free to use for all Tech students. near the Drillfield is War Memorial Hall a newly renovated gym that hosts athletic activities of all kinds PERIOD With multiple courts that can be reserved for games such as basketball racquetball volleyball and squash cardio and weight training rooms as well as swimming pools and more War Memorial Hall is home to activities that cater to a variety of interests PERIOD

Near Lane Stadium is McComas Hall a gym that has some of the same as well as different offerings than that of its aforementioned counterpart PERIOD While it does have weight training rooms cardio equipment areas a pool as well as volleyball and basketball courts like War Memorial Hall does this gym has an indoor jogging track an spin cycling room and two fitness studios. for those seeking to participate in some fun outdoor exercising the fitness park located at the Prairie Quad near residences halls Lee PeddrewYates and New Residence Hall East may be the place for you. its newly renovated with basketball and sand volleyball courts and has upperbody equipment such as rings and bars for anyone who wants to get in some extra exercise PERIOD

My advice is that the gym basketball courts can get really crowded and cluttered so bring a ball to the outdoor courts by Pritchard and youll have a much easier time finding a game and youll make some friends too said Robert Brinker a rising senior at Virginia Tech studying management PERIOD

The goto place for getting work done having group meetings and studying for that upcoming test of yours is definitely Newman Library Virginia Techs premier location for getting on your academic grind. aside from being able to check out books and rent academiarelated resources the library is the perfect place to be your place of work PERIOD Study spaces group work rooms and studios are some of the numerous options available among the five floors that the library has PERIOD

Similar to Newman Library New Classroom Building commonly referred to as NCB is a popular oncampus spot for getting work done PERIOD Located near Perry Street Parking Deck New Classroom Building is a building that serves various purposes PERIOD A number of classes are held in its lecture rooms while other spaces allow students to study hold group meetings and get work done. for any personal health concerns that arise during your time at Virginia Tech the Schiffert Health Center is your oncampus clinic option PERIOD You need to schedule an appointment to see a care provider which can be done via a phone call or on its website PERIOD For those who take prescribed medications a number of options are available to be fulfilled through the health centers pharmacy PERIOD Services such as STI testing health screenings and various other healthcarerelated needs are also available PERIOD

Cook Counseling Center is an oncampus resource thats covered under tuition for any students seeking counseling or other forms of personal help PERIOD Options such as individual counseling group workshops and referral services are some of the many offerings that the center provides PERIOD
