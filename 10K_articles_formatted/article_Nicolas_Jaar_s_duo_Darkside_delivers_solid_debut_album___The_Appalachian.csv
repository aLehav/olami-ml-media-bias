Progressive rock as its normally defined has been around since the late 60s when bands such as King Crimson and Pink Floyd began taking the psychedelic pop of that era to expansive bizarre realms PERIOD

The most popular music to come out of the prog movement  namely Genesis and Yes  has since been derided for its selfindulgence and absurd thematic concepts PERIOD

Yet the sprawling expressiveness of the genre still appeals to many listeners PERIOD Most exciting is when modern bands find ways to translate progs adventurousness into new forms and genres PERIOD

Darkside the recently formed duo of acclaimed minimal techno producer Nicolas Jaar and guitarist Dave Harrington have done just that with their excellent debut album Psychic. expanding on the style of their previously released Darkside EP Psychic toes a fascinating balance between bluesy progressive rock a la Pink Floyd and warped techno PERIOD

Jaars previous work ran the gamut from spacedout jazz to throbbing house music but here his eclecticism is sharper and more coherent PERIOD

Harringtons wonderful guitar arpeggios throughout the album draw heavily from Floyd guitarist David Gilmour but overall the music sounds more like druggedup disco when matched with pounding precise dance beats PERIOD

However the style with which these grooves are stitched together on the album is transparently similar to progressive rock PERIOD

The 11minute opener Golden Arrow is a prime example PERIOD It takes four minutes of meandering synthesizer ambience before drums kick in but it makes sense in context PERIOD Without the drama and mood setting of those opening minutes the songs explosive climax wouldnt be nearly as effective PERIOD

More progressive is the way Darkside develops melodic motifs throughout the album PERIOD They take time to tease each guitar or synth line out and try them in several different contexts PERIOD Even the shorter poppier track Paper Trails uses this technique PERIOD

Despite the expansiveness and nonlinear structures Psychic never becomes tiresome due to the groups exquisite attention to detail PERIOD Additionally the albums second half is a blast to dance to as it leans toward the percussionheavy techno on which Jaar made his name PERIOD

If theres one thing Darkside could improve it might be the use of vocals PERIOD Although Paper Trails finds Jaar using his trademark cynicalsounding baritone many of the songs feature his husky falsetto and those performances arent nearly as confident PERIOD

Overall Darksides progressive fusion of genres is totally unique and fascinating though this listener suspects theyll develop further as a unit and maybe live up to the Floydian legacy inherent in their name PERIOD
