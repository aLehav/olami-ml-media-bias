Its problematic when an episode of Scooby Doo Where Are You is more thrilling than mysteries written for adults PERIOD

Manhattan Mayhem is a collection of short mystery and crime stories presented by Mystery Writers of America MWA and edited by Mary Higgins Clark author of Where Are the Children and more than  other bestselling suspense novels PERIOD Each of the  stories is written by a different MWA writer and is set in a different Manhattan neighborhood PERIOD

The transitions between the neighborhoods are subtle and might not be apparent to those unfamiliar with New York City PERIOD Manhattan Mayhem doesnt use its setting to the fullest simply treating the city as a backdrop PERIOD The particular qualities of the neighborhoods could have been more pronounced to make the setting more like a character and add personality to each individual story PERIOD The events that take place could happen in any big city so it doesnt feel very New York except for some throwaway references to recognizable landmarks and New York stereotypes PERIOD

A theme of murder runs through many of the stories but it never feels redundant because of the unique voices the authors bring to their stories and distinct changes in tone and mood PERIOD Some create an eerie atmosphere to set the reader on edge like The FiveDollar Dress where the setting is the apartment of someones recentlydeceased grandmother PERIOD Others rely on action to move the plot along such as The Baker of Bleecker Street a tale of espionage during World War II PERIOD

A looming problem in Manhattan Mayhem however is the absurdity of some of the plots PERIOD In Evermore a thief enlists the help of a timetraveling Edgar Allen Poe to rob a strip club PERIOD Really PERIOD Its hard to tell if Evermore is supposed to be campy but its premise is so ludicrous that its hard to take seriously PERIOD Nevertheless it was quite enjoyable to read in the same way its enjoyable to watch a Bmovie PERIOD Its so bad its good PERIOD

On the other end of the spectrum is RedHeaded Stepchild. conflict arises when a little girl gets head lice PERIOD Head lice dont provide enough tension to make for an engaging mystery PERIOD It lacks suspense and is tragically anticlimactic PERIOD

Trapped is another story with an unsatisfying end but author Ben H PERIOD Winters plays with form to make the tale of murder somewhat enticing PERIOD It is about the homicide of the producer of a play within a play about murder PERIOD Did you get that It gets even more meta because Winters writes Trapped as a play complete with stage directions and a cast page PERIOD This creativity sets it apart from the other stories but its drab and generic whodunit premise doesnt provide enough twists to make for a gripping story PERIOD

Manhattan Mayhem does not ask its readers to think critically or grapple with moral questions but that doesnt diminish its value PERIOD The short story formula is perfect for students who dont have much time to read because even the longest story can be read in one sitting PERIOD The resolutions are served on a silver platter to the reader and dont require much mental effort to understand perfect after a long day of class PERIOD

But it takes a bit of sleuthing to find whats worthwhile PERIOD

The verdictFor a book set in the city that never sleeps Manhattan Mayhem is a snooze PERIOD
