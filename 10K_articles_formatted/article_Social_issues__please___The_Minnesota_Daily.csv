As far as I have seen no gubernatorial candidate has done a particularly exceptional job in stating their stance on immigration laws or reform with the exception of publicly criticizing the Arizona Immigration Law allowing police to investigate the legal status of any apparent immigrant. yet that remains exclusive to Independence candidate Tom Horner and DFL candidate Mark Dayton PERIOD Republican candidate Tom Emmer first promoted the law claiming it was a wonderful first step in immigration reform and later after Arizona began facing legal issues with the new law retracted his statement PERIOD Though I didnt have a chance to see it personally I know Emmer also uncomfortably evaded questions surrounding general social issues such as gay rights in the gubernatorial debate on Friday PERIOD
Perhaps job growth opportunities and economic stability are at the center of this upcoming election with a mounting budget deficit PERIOD But in any case its important to consider the pressing issues so meticulously imbedded in the social fabric of our community and the stances our gubernatorial candidates take with regard to these quandaries PERIOD We need to look at what makes us work as a social system our jobs education economic development and more than anything the people who often contribute to the base of this pyramid day in and day out without receiving the continual support so many of us take for granted PERIOD Im talking here about immigrants legal or not and their contribution to the groundwork of a society PERIOD
If you vote I urge you to consider these things in selecting a candidate that suits your political background PERIOD
