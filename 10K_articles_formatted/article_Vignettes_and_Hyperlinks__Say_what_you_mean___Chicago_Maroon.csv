2181,2022-03-16,"its midafternoon in the Max Central lobby PERIOD Were all waiting for coach to pick us up in the alwaysentertaining everunique sometimeskindabroken 15passenger van PERIOD Not everyones here yet but this isnt a 630am practice so we dont have to go through the usual ordeal of calling everyone whos missing to make sure theyre awake PERIOD So about five of us just sit there quietly PERIOD

A couple of girls walk across the lobby to the mail room PERIOD We sit some more PERIOD They get their packages or at least one of them does PERIOD I think the other girl is just there for moral support as the mail room can be a harrowing experiencebut actually PERIOD As they walk back across the room one girl is telling the other about some conversation she had the other day PERIOD

Yeah I was talking to him the other day. really

Yeah oh my god it was so funny it was like the funniest thing Id ever heard. wait but butwait PERIOD Full stop PERIOD It wasnt PERIOD It just wasnt PERIOD Like what you just said was an entirely untrue statement PERIOD Whatever whoever said to whomever was just not the funniest thing that you or anyone else had ever heard PERIOD Thats just not what it was PERIOD

I dont know why it annoys me PERIOD It really shouldnt PERIOD Its a stupid pet peeve to have PERIOD I know what she means PERIOD I know that she doesnt actually think whatever she heard is the the funniest thing shes ever heard PERIOD But she did say that it was PERIOD And because of that I have no idea how funny it actually was PERIOD Not that I really have any business in the matter PERIOD I am eavesdropping on someone elses conversation and thus have absolutely no right to a deeper understanding of any of the words uttered PERIOD But this also obviously isnt the first time I or anyone else has heard this type of exaggeration PERIOD

There is a natural tendency among well humans especially the young kind to make sure the impact of what were saying is felt to ensure that people are listening PERIOD But when we achieve this end by making a caricature of the truth its just kind of a bother for everyone involved PERIOD For one as a listener if every fifth thing is the funniest or the best or the stupidest I have no way of calibrating a continuum of meaning or moderation therein PERIOD I dont know what level of extremeness to assign to any given statement PERIOD If things that are notso funny funny very funny and incredibly funny are all described as the funniest thing ever well how am I to know you know Whats really actually funny anymore While this instinct to intensify every emotion in the retelling to make our lives sound more incredible than they actually are is certainly not surprising and probably not newI cant really say for sure I havent been around that long it makes it rather difficult to understand what the Jeeves anyone is actually trying to say anymore PERIOD

Were all guilty of it and its obviously not the only way all these damn youths are constantly worsening English as a language PERIOD Its kind of a dumb thing to notice a dumber thing to be bothered by and something even dumber still to write an article about PERIOD But its frustrating to a word nerd like me and cumbersome to all who engage in conversation PERIOD It makes talking to people a more burdening and less enjoyable experience and it impedes effective communication PERIOD

I guess you could deem this a call to action but Id really rather not think of it that way since calling on anyone to do anything is kind of not my place as an unaccomplished college student whos never done much of note and is still dependent upon his parents PERIOD But Id like to hope that maybe the simple days of your future can be retold as the simple days they were without the need to be heard corrupting their existences PERIOD I hope that the next funny joke you hear will never be anything more than funny PERIOD
