7919,2023-10-23,"the new Ferguson Center is beautiful PERIOD I was blown away by its spaciousness and how much better architecturally it is now than before PERIOD With the University of Alabamas new buildings and restaurants the idea was to provide a greater variety of dining options for a growing student population PERIOD Bama Dining has expanded to include more options but theyre all the same PERIOD Instead of using the additional space for new options such as healthy or vegetarian food the additions are strictly fast food venues PERIOD Yes we now have a Wendys and a Raising Canes and one of the two ChickfilA vendors on campus has expanded to accommodate more students PERIOD Although this is exciting it is an issue of quantity over quality PERIOD

Ive spoken with a few students who want healthier options PERIOD One student said the Ferguson Center managers told her these fast food vendors provided healthy options PERIOD I assume when they say this they are referring to the salads at these venues PERIOD According to the nutrition page on Wendys official website some of their   salads are close to    calories which is more than some of the sandwiches theyre serving PERIOD As much as these companies like to tell you otherwise their ingredients arent fresh PERIOD There is a long list of preservatives that go into these items PERIOD Bottom line a ChickfilA Wendys or Subway salad doesnt count as a healthy option PERIOD

Believe it or not there are students on this campus who are vegan or vegetarian PERIOD Ive met them PERIOD There are few to no substantial options available to them on campus PERIOD The Fresh Foods vegetarian option is basically another underdeveloped salad bar PERIOD According to The Crimson White the organization Peta2 surveyed the dining options at the University last year and gave it a grade of B for vegetarian options PERIOD Today I cant imagine it getting anything higher than a D PERIOD The University is diverse and its dining should be too PERIOD

My argument here is not that healthy   options dont exist at the University  they certainly do but in an extremely limited capacity PERIOD Burke and Lakeside provide minor insubstantial alternatives PERIOD Im just disappointed in how the University has chosen to expand student dining PERIOD I understand how hard it is to produce food for a student body and do it well but I wonder if there are any local businesses willing to set up shop and cater on campus to provide a more natural and homemade food option PERIOD Could we have a food vendor on this campus that you couldnt find in any airport or food court mall across the country Do we really need an Auntie Annes Pretzels or a Panda Express especially when theres one less than a mile off of campus

The University should care about this PERIOD Our diets are related to our education  what we eat affects how we feel and function and therefore also affects our academic performance PERIOD Today I will have to leave campus to have lunch PERIOD Tomorrow hopefully things will be different PERIOD
