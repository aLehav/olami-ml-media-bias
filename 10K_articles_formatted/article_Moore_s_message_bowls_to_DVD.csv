One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

Since its big screen debut last year the mere mention of
Bowling for Columbine creates an eerie tension amid its viewers PERIOD
Especially after his infamous Academy Award acceptance speech the
films director Michael Moore seems to spark controversy wherever
he goes PERIOD Now several postponements later Bowling for Columbine
makes its way to DVD bringing with it four extra hours of special
features and an emotional intensity like no other PERIOD

The film itself is as psychologically haunting as it was on the
big screen PERIOD The audience is jerked through every pole on the
emotional spectrum PERIOD At times the film incites a kind of nervous
laughter where one questions whether it is okay to laugh in the
wake of school killings and international warfare then shifts to
the indescribable sadness of violence and fear rampant in American
culture PERIOD It easily claims its title as one of the most influential
boxoffice smash movies of this generation PERIOD

More often than not the scenes are tough to watch whether for
the first time or the tenth and Moore presents an undoubtedly
harsh critique of American society PERIOD It is still undoubtedly one of
the most thoughtprovoking films of recent memory PERIOD

As for the special features dont expect any of the flashy
outtake reels or behindthescenes gags of typical DVDs PERIOD Instead
the viewer receives an abundance of Michael Moore interviews
lectures and television snippets of the films creator himself in a
simple but entertaining form PERIOD Some segments show him joking with
talk show hosts others discuss the movies numerous awards
including a recreation of Moores Oscar rant in his backyard PERIOD In
the Return to Littleton segment Moore addresses the families of
Columbine and citizens offering their reactions to the film PERIOD

On the lighter side Moore and crew have added a longer
rendition of Corporate Cops. this is not to say the extras are in
any way banal or boring for Moore fans PERIOD On the contrary it seems
Moore can capture his audience whether his mood is lighthearted or
solemn PERIOD However the extended period of commentary may feel like a
bit much for some viewers PERIOD

Though the sound remains stellar for the main flick it tends to
fade in and out for a few of the other features PERIOD Beware of the live
award show footage as the audience noise and technical glitches
make it difficult to hear at times PERIOD

As a now mainstream movie Bowling for Columbine can elicit
more reactions from its audience than previously thought possible
within a fiveminute timeframe PERIOD It will infuriate PERIOD It will inspire PERIOD
It will make its viewer feel physically ill PERIOD And yes it might even
make you consider Canada as a prime candidate for your next
home PERIOD
