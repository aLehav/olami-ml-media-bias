Artist Kate Gilmore spoke about her experience of transforming her artwork from videos to the interaction of public art installations during her lecture to the UT community Thursday evening PERIOD

The Ewing Gallery hosted Gilmore as part of the School of Art Programming Committee lecture series and held a reception after the lecture for her exhibit In Your Way. gilmore is a renowned artist who lives and works in New York City NY where she is an associate professor of art and design at Purchase College PERIOD She attended Bates College in Maine where she graduated in  then graduated with her masters from the School of Visual Arts in New York in  PERIOD

Gilmores first art pieces were videos of herself made alone in her studio PERIOD Her first video My Love is an Anchor showed her in a black cocktail dress trying to free her foot from a bucket of dried plaster PERIOD

I was making really laborious sculptures like a pillow made five thousand times .. PERIOD or like really big installations and it was really clear that no one was interested in what I was making PERIOD They were more interested in the process Gilmore said PERIOD So it became clear that the objects were not functioning like they should PERIOD So I was just like how am I going to do this  Im just going to insert myself into my work. gilmores art career took off after one of her pieces was displayed on a jumbotron in New York City and then another video was bought by New York Citys Museum of Modern Art PERIOD

As Gilmore talked about her artwork showing videos and pictures of her installations she encouraged the audience to interact by asking questions throughout the discussion PERIOD

One of Gilmores points was how her art interacts with her ideas of femininity from the outfits she wears in her videos to the ones she chooses for the models in her public art installations PERIOD Her art also displays the beauty of destruction PERIOD

A big part of my process is destruction Gilmore said PERIOD Destruction to rebuild something else that I think perhaps might be more beautiful PERIOD This can be a symbol for lots of things  you use things in a way that they should not be used or theyre transformed into a way that  perhaps the thing that comes out of that ends up being more special or more beautiful or functional or more inclusive. gilmore has received several international awards including the Guggenheim Fellowship  the ArtPrize Juried Award in Grand Rapids Michigan in  the Rauschenberg Residency Award from the Rauschenberg Foundation  the Rome Prize from the American Academy in Rome  and many more PERIOD

Christina Jones a graduate student from University of Utah and video artist herself received a travel grant to be able to attend Gilmores lecture because she is writing her thesis about her PERIOD

Its great to see the humor and the delicate balance that comes between the brutality and struggle thats in her work in the gallery versus the very lighthearted open to anything attitude that she goes about Jones said PERIOD

After the lecture the audience moved into the Ewing Gallery for Gilmores reception of her solo travel exhibit In Your Way with her videos playing on screens on the walls and three orange cubes in the middle of the room PERIOD

After signing a waiver students were given gloves safety glasses and hammers and were encouraged to hit the cubes as many times as they wanted PERIOD The ultimate goal was to flatten the cubes as much as possible PERIOD

April Marten UT graduate student in time based art explained how this type of interaction shows how much Gilmores art has evolved over time PERIOD

As you can see with how her work evolved eventually the work went out into the world where the performance is happening before an audience Marten said PERIOD And then you go this next step where the students will be involved in a participatory art event versus them being hired performers so the work extends through the way that you and I the public the people who visit interact with the work. editorinChief
