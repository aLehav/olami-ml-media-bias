Editors Note In honor of Womens History Month in an attempt to decenter whiteness and men from the perception of our history the Opinion section is pursuing nine pieces that aim to amplify BIPoC women of the UW and their contributions to the community  and our history PERIOD

If there is one thing that Dr PERIOD Carolyn West considers herself to be it is generally fearless. the reason for that a plane PERIOD

I was at a pretty low point in my life I had some stuff going on and I said OK what can I do that Im really afraid of she said PERIOD Jump out of a plane And then after that you survive that  you dont have anything to be afraid of. while jumping out of a plane is a fairly good way to build character and grit West has been pushing boundaries for her entire life in both her research and her career PERIOD At her very core she has the admirable drive to be fearless and brave two tools necessary to carve out a place for herself PERIOD

Even still as a Black woman shes never had it easy PERIOD But Wests drive and passion for intersectionality and justice led her to where she is today a founding faculty member of the UW Tacoma department of psychology researching intimate partner violence and the hypersexualization of women in the media PERIOD

West was introduced to the topic in the eighth grade when she checked out a book from the library titled Scream Quietly or the Neighbors Will Hear by Erin Pizzey which detailed elements of family violence PERIOD Since then West just knew that studying psychology and family violence was what she wanted to pursue PERIOD

During her time at the University of New Hampshire she had the opportunity to study under Murray Straus made notable by the fact that Straus first description of family violence scales was mentioned in Pizzeys book PERIOD

But during her time at the University of Missouri West became an accidental activist. in the 1990s sexual harassment wasnt as widely recognized as it is now and laws were not in place to protect women PERIOD West was sexually harassed by a professor and she chose to challenge the university in a court of law PERIOD

I ended up complaining talking to the director of womens studies who was my mentor and I ended up filing a lawsuit against the university for sexual harassment West said PERIOD And I started giving newspaper and television interviews about it because I felt like it was really critical not to be silent about PERIOD And that was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. the University of Missouri settled out of court and changed their policies surrounding sexual assault as a result PERIOD This experience reaffirmed for West that the only way to create change is to be vocal PERIOD

And so for me speaking out about any kind of injustice is important if you are really going to make change and somebody is going to have to be the person who stands up and does that PERIOD And then when you do you give other people permission to be brave and live authentically. not only does West live authentically as herself her actions continue to encourage others to embrace the same fearlessness she embodies PERIOD That being said West recognizes that speaking up isnt always the easiest thing to do PERIOD

It feels in some ways being very exposed and in some ways you become a target when you speak out about these issues  but that just makes it even more important to speak out about these issues she said PERIOD

West has gained confidence through her unusual research and her positive experiences in the UW community PERIOD She takes pride in working to uplift the stories of women of color as a part of this community herself and continues to pursue this work inspired by her personal history PERIOD

Having sued a major university in my mid20s being a firstgeneration college student and coming from  if you go back to the work that I do Im the granddaughter of sharecroppers West said PERIOD I mean coming from that  knowing your history in that way coming from that background what is there really to be afraid of The people who came before me the kind of challenges they had to face PERIOD You know I think I can stare down my white male colleagues who do this work. in her work West has found that people are open to having difficult conversations about conventional and institutional racism something she is heartened by PERIOD Amidst the pandemic and racial justice movements there is no longer time to think small  as West suggests no more waiting. this has never been more true PERIOD

Wests attitude is purely inspiring pushing beyond societal boundaries has become a key part of her life and of her work PERIOD She has paved her own way throughout the entirety of her career establishing a department around a field she has been passionate about since eighth grade PERIOD Her drive to create an equitable space for women is so powerful and this sentiment must be expanded beyond her classroom PERIOD

It is difficult to be authentically yourself PERIOD Societal barriers prevent women from acting freely PERIOD But that doesnt limit the confidence and fearlessness that can be exhibited by powerful women especially women of color given the right support systems and environments PERIOD West has most definitely done this for herself and through her work she encourages other women and her students to pursue and find the environments that allow them to be brave  just as other women have helped her to do PERIOD

And so West will continue to live her life following the words of Black poet Audre Lorde Im going to go out like a fing meteor. reach Managing Editor Rachel Morgan at opiniondailyuw.com PERIOD Twitter rclmorgan
