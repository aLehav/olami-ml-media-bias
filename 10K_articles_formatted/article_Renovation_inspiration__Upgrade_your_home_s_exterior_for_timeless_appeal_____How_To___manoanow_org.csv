ARA  As spring approaches and the winter snow begins to melt
from your roof and lawn now is a great time to step back and
survey what you can do to improve the look of your home for the
warm summer months and for years to come PERIOD

Could your house use an exterior upgrade Would you like a boost
of color but are afraid to stray from neutrals Do you wish your
home looked like the ones you see in magazines and television
shows

Renovating a homes exterior is one way to dramatically improve
the overall curb appeal PERIOD

Patterson partner at BSB

Some homeowners might feel they do not have the tools they need
to begin a renovation and can become overwhelmed when thinking
about the process PERIOD The good news is todays leading architects and
product manufacturers are working to give homeowners the
inspiration and confidence to move forward with an exterior
renovation PERIOD

 says John Stephenson of Ply Gem a building products
manufacturer that has introduced a collection of inspirational home
style visuals and guidelines to help homeowners begin conversations
with their contractor PERIOD

To help arm homeowners with the tools they need to upgrade their
exterior Ply Gem and BSB Design offer these tips PERIOD

Realize the possibilities

Years ago it was virtually impossible to maintain historically
accurate character when building or renovating using
lowmaintenance materials PERIOD Thanks to technological advancements in
product manufacturing processes builders and homeowners can now
achieve beautiful colorful home designs without the maintenance
and cost of natural materials PERIOD Many products such as insulated
siding and triple pane windows also offer the added benefit of
energy efficiency PERIOD

Which architectural style suits your personal style

Knowing which home style youre partial to will help narrow down
the features you add to your home in a renovation PERIOD For an
oldworld European style consider the architectural details of
the French Country Spanish Eclectic or Tuscan PERIOD For a more
contemporary or transitional aesthetic look to the Prairie and
Craftsman PERIOD And for traditional styles Shingle and Georgian
features work well PERIOD

Dont be color shy

Exterior home color selection can be an overwhelming process
especially because its one of the longestterm decisions that
homeowners have to make PERIOD However going beyond white or beige and
using the right color combinations can take a home from drab to
stunning PERIOD  says Patterson PERIOD Look to collections like The Designed Exterior Collection
by Ply Gem that simplify color selection by identifying
palettes that work for each architectural style PERIOD Another easy way
to incorporate color is by mixing in other materials such as stone
veneer and bold window exteriors with vinyl siding PERIOD

Be particular when it comes to architecture

Each architectural style has key defining features that reflect
the era in which it was introduced PERIOD To stay true to the elements
that characterize the particular style work with your contractor
or architect and determine which materials should be used to
achieve the look you desire PERIOD Consider features such as low pitched
roofs for modern styles like the Craftsman and Prairie use of
stone veneer or stucco in Europeaninspired styles or incorporation
of handsplit shakes in the Shingle style PERIOD Window design is also an
important aspect of architectural styling that is often overlooked PERIOD
Colonial grilles offer a traditional style while fixed or casement
windows with minimal grilles provide a streamlined modern
look PERIOD
