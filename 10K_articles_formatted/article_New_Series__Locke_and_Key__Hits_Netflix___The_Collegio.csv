Based on the book by Sarah Dessen Locke and Key has been reviewed by parents and teens and has been rated  and up.There is a presence of drugs alcohol abuse physical abuse and some scenes portraying sex.However over all this Netflix show is a great watch for the whole family PERIOD

This show is creative and intense and deserves to be watched.Netflix has not yet renewed the show for a season two yet however season one was just released so we should be expected an answer from Netflix here shortly PERIOD

After watching season one of Locke and Key I am very excited for the upcoming seasons PERIOD This show is every bit of magical and fascinating as the reviews promised PERIOD My only complaint is having to wait another year for season two to be released PERIOD Locke and Key gets an A rating PERIOD
