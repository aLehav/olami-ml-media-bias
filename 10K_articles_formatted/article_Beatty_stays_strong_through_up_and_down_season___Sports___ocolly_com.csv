Lakota Beatty plays against Missouri State on Saturday afternoon PERIOD The Cowgirls won  PERIOD

Lakota Beatty took the basketball up the court and launched the shot to the hoop PERIOD

It went through the basket for the gamewinner but something didnt seem right as the referee didnt end the game PERIOD Instead after checking the replay it appeared the clock struck zero with the ball still in the Beattys grasp PERIOD The game was over and the Oklahoma State Cowgirls had lost their fourth straight PERIOD

For the sophomore out of Anadarko the season has been full of its ups and downs the same way it was in the Kansas State game PERIOD Beatty had a careerhigh  points but it was all in vain as fate was not in the Cowgirls corner PERIOD

At the beginning of the season Beatty got a chance to fill a starting spot in some of the earlier games because of injuries to Katelyn Loecker and Liz Donohoe and the suspension of Brittany Atkins PERIOD The 5foot8 Beatty impressed showing a knack for the 3point shot while being a solid contributor on defense until the starters returned from absence PERIOD Beatty went back to the bench with some experience coming from the exposure of a starting role PERIOD

Four seven nine seven one four two These were the minutes Beatty played early this season with four games speckled through without any playing time PERIOD She didnt care however because the Cowgirls were winning PERIOD

My parents really taught me to keep working hard no matter what the circumstances were  you dont know whats going to happen Beatty said PERIOD It kind of motivated me more to just get in the gym and shoot more. she pointed to the idea that being a good teammate is more important than ones personal goals PERIOD Loecker forward for OSU and Beattys roommate since freshman year believed the diminishing playing time didnt seem to affect Beatty PERIOD Loecker said Beatty just worked through it and never really complained PERIOD Instead the roommates just went home tired from practice and watched movies with a cup of coffee never once discussing the lack of playing time PERIOD

On Jan PERIOD  tragedy struck PERIOD The Cowgirls were sitting at  when they played a game at GallagherIba Arena against West Virginia PERIOD At the time the Cowgirls were undefeated in GIA and the Mountaineers were winless in conference play PERIOD In the second half Loecker came out as a starter for Atkins who was later revealed to have suffered a meniscus tear and was done for the season PERIOD

I knew what she was going through because of my shoulder surgery but this is like her third surgery on her knee Loecker said PERIOD Its really tough on the team because B.A PERIOD was such a good player and teammate. along with the loss of Atkins as a teammate was her loss of production she averaged  pointsand had a great defensive presence PERIOD Coach Jim Littell had said at the time that somebody else had to step up and seize the opportunity PERIOD Littell felt the decision would fall to see who would be the most beneficial to the teams chances of winning PERIOD

Lakotas got some savvy to her game Littell said PERIOD What I mean by that is that she has the ability to put the ball on the floor and find the open person as well as shoot the basketball. beatty came back from almost a month of sparse playing time to significant minutes in the TCU game on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD She said she was extremely nervous going into the game and just mentally went over the scouting report before the game PERIOD As the first player off the bench she had five points and two assists in  minutes PERIOD However the Cowgirls still lost to the Horned Frogs to extend their slump PERIOD

After the Kansas State game Beatty said she was very upset and heartbroken. the Cowgirls were left to ponder what could have been as they fell to  in the Big  and went to Ames Iowa and the vaunted Hilton Coliseum PERIOD The coaching staff preached defense in the days leading up to the game as OSU been close in all its losses and had a chance as long as Iowa States strength the long ball was taken away PERIOD

Beatty was tasked with keeping Cyclone guard Nicole Blaskowsky a 41percent shooter from beyond the arc at bay PERIOD Beatty did just that PERIOD She was on the Cyclone all night and limited her to zero points as the Cowgirls were vindicated with a win in Ames that halted their skid PERIOD

Following the trials and the tribulations of the losing streak Beatty regards her faith as the one constant force thats driven her and kept her undeterred PERIOD She and Loecker are members of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and it has kept their spirits up as well as helping them with basketball PERIOD A key focus with the team this season has been for the players to keep their body language positive and just shake off the bad calls PERIOD Beatty said having her faith makes her hold herself accountable and move on from the calls such as the one in the Kansas State game PERIOD That doctrine of staying positive and withstanding the misery of losing is what she attributes to be the motivation for the remainder of the Cowgirls season PERIOD

I think Lakota listens and shes coachable in what she does Littell said PERIOD  I think she wants to be a good teammate and please the coaching staff and do whats asked of her. sportsocolly.com
