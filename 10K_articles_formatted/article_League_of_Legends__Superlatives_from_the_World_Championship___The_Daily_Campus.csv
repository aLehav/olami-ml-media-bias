Now that the World Championship has ended its finally time to look back on the entire event and the players and storylines that made it as good as it was PERIOD So this is gonna be my relatively subjective superlatives including Rookie of the Tournament Underdog Team of the Year and Biggest Disappointment PERIOD

The hardest part of determining winners for most individual accolades is simply deciding which DAMWON player to give it to the DAMWON team was so far above everyone else that there are few awards not given to one of their players PERIOD However one award that I would give to someone else is the Rookie of the Tournament award PERIOD Im being pretty loose on what I consider a rookie besides it has to be your first Worlds PERIOD

Huanfeng the bot laner of Suning more than earned the award even if I think there are other good players PERIOD His ulting JD Gaming from the base on Jhin before pulling off two super good series in a row was beyond impressive and a very good sign for Suning despite their eventual defeat PERIOD Suningstop laner Bin certainly claims an honorable mention in this category as does Keria from DRX PERIOD

There is perhaps not amore unsurprising superlative than Most Disappointing Team PERIOD This honor goes of course to TSM PERIOD After coming into the tournament as thefirst seed from North America TSM was absolutely awful losing all six games that they played at Worlds and reminding us all why North America has such a terrible reputation internationally PERIOD While there were some ok performances from some players Spicahad a good game or two which was impressive as a rookie at Worlds it just was nowhere near good enough PERIOD

Most Surprising Underdog is a category that was difficult for me to quantify PERIOD The obvious winner would be Suning Gaming after their impressive runfrom not even being a top ten LPL team in the spring to being the secondbestteam in the world PERIOD However there was a dark horse in this category who I ended up giving this toPSG Talon PERIOD In the playins PSG had  subs for all of their games after visaissues PERIOD Despite this they played incredibly well and made it to the group stage PERIOD Dee the substitute ADC deserves bonus credit for playing very well despite not playing professionally for a pretty long time PERIOD

The second to last superlative that Im going to give is not actually to a player this is the category of Most Important Pick PERIOD I seriously considered Lucian in this category with his crazy pick ban or Ornn who continues to beseason in and season outa very impactful top laner PERIOD In the endI went with Graves for his massive prominence in the jungle while feeling like he shouldve been banned in just about every game PERIOD Graves is very powerful right now and good junglers playing him won games PERIOD

The final award is of course the Most Valuable Player award PERIOD This was another award that I wavered on many times of coursewhile itmust go to a DAMWON playerthere are five of those and every single one had incredible plays throughout the tournament PERIOD In the end I decided to go with Canyon for this award PERIOD Junglers were absolutely monumentally important this tournament and Canyon showed up massively for his team throughout the entire tournament PERIOD He more than earned the honor of MVP PERIOD
