A Cal State Fullerton professor is making an impact on a medical mystery by performing extensive research on the genetic aspect of HIV progression and its genetic relationship to immunity PERIOD

Catherine Brennan Ph.D. a biology professor is helping solve the question as to why some people with HIV can live normally for more than a decade before the virus progresses to AIDS PERIOD

Brennan is looking into the process of phagocytosis immunology and teaching biology PERIOD Prior to becoming a member of the faculty she spent about the last four years researching why the immune systems of certain individuals infected with HIV help block the development of AIDS and how some do not require any drug treatment PERIOD

As an assistant research scientist at the UCLA AIDS Institutes David Geffen School of Medicine Brennans collaboration with researchers identified a specific immune activation event that occurs in the first months of infection that may result in the long term slower progression of the disease PERIOD

As the main author of the study Brennan has written several scholarly research articles and has also been published as the cover story in the October  issue of the Journal of Virology PERIOD

Brennan grew up in Vancouver Canada and lives in Los Angeles with her family PERIOD She possesses a rich academic background and demonstrates her love of learning through teaching and research PERIOD

With her broad academic background and scientific research skills Brennan provides valuable expertise and knowledge to the biology department and her students PERIOD

Jose Guardado a junior biochemistry major said he enjoyed being in Brennans class and the enthusiasm she incorporated into her teaching PERIOD

Sciencewise I learned about photosynthesis and how a plant makes its energy compared to an animal cell  she was very straightforward Guardado said PERIOD She was also open to any questions she did not intimidate anybody PERIOD She was very enthusiastic about her teaching and very helpful PERIOD You can tell she loves her job. brennans initial academic focus was not on biology PERIOD Her interest in biology was sparked while completing her undergraduate degree in philosophy and working on a farm PERIOD

I was always very interested in how animals interact with microbes Brennan said PERIOD At age  I started to think I wanted to go into something life sciences related but I was at that time thinking something more of ecology so I took some undergrad classes to prepare for that kind of graduate school  and then I got interested in pure biology. brennan earned her bachelors degree in philosophy at Williams College in Massachusetts PERIOD She earned her masters degree at USC in marine biology focusing on squid luminous bacterial symbiosis in her studies PERIOD She continued at USC and went on to obtain her doctorate in molecular biology there PERIOD

Her academic focus includes cell biology genetics and immunology PERIOD Brennan is studying Drosophila a type of fruit fly often used for genetic research PERIOD She is also studying immunity research with a focus on phagocytosis when white blood cells eat microbes such as bacteria or fungi PERIOD

She is interested in identifying new genes and understanding how they work not only in flies but also in humans PERIOD This interest eventually led to her research on HIV PERIOD

After HIV was discovered medical researchers created a test for people to see if they were infected with the virus according to the UCLA AIDS Institute PERIOD They studied the immune systems response in the early months of infection and found that many people were able to fend off the progression of AIDS PERIOD

Soon after they identified the virus they developed a test for people that had HIV so even if people did not have symptoms they could recognize they were infected with HIV Brennan said PERIOD

Researchers recognized that genetics play a pivotal role in immunity to HIV progression PERIOD

Brennan said there are some genes that are extremely variable PERIOD

It turned out that people who were resisting the disease progression were still infected but could contain the infection she said PERIOD Those people tend to have one or two of these variants PERIOD

It seemed about  percent or half a percent of people that are infected with HIV do not need any drug treatment they will just stay healthy Brennan said PERIOD But as time went by there were some people that just were not getting sick    years later and they are still staying healthy without any medication and so the work that I was doing was focused on those individuals. although Brennan spends many hours performing research she enjoys spending time with her family during her off days PERIOD

I spend a lot of time with my family on the weekends PERIOD We like hiking going to the beach and traveling she said PERIOD

As a biology professor she intends to offer advanced courses on cell biology and immunology in the future PERIOD
