Many students start blogs to write down their thoughts create their own voice or make a name for themselves PERIOD The students at Drake University are no different PERIOD

The blogs of Drake University students range from fashion to poetry to completely private to blogging as a job PERIOD

These bloggers also have a variety of different motives for creating blogs and websites PERIOD One of the most common in the journalism school has been to share their thoughts and complete assignments in journalism classes PERIOD

Firstyear Maggie Dickman created a blog before she came to Drake as a platform to share her fashion beauty and lifestyle favorites and ideas. after reading other blogs she created her own as a way to connect with other people who had the same interests PERIOD Dickman tries to post once a week to inspire others PERIOD She believes blogging is a great way to share ideas with others and the comments section can be helpful for feedback PERIOD

Dickman is now a blogger for Drake Magazine where she blogs about fashion trends PERIOD

Firstyear Mia Rush created a blog when she was in high school but never felt like there was a focus to her posts PERIOD After a long time of infrequent posts she decided to delete it PERIOD This past winter Rush began blogging again with a new purpose PERIOD Having a blog gives Rush an outlet to voice some of her opinions and also allows her to expand her creativity. most students begin blogging by reading other blogs PERIOD Looking at other blogs can help them determine their own voice and style PERIOD All of these bloggers have been inspired by other bloggers PERIOD Most importantly reading blogs encourages them to keep writing PERIOD

No matter how badly I do on an assignment or how well I do I never want to stop writing PERIOD Writing is my life Rush said PERIOD

Emily Tozer a Drake alumna began blogging as an assignment for a journalism class PERIOD Unlike most students Tozer did not stop blogging at the end of the semester PERIOD She kept writing and earlier this year launched her own website PERIOD It is geared toward style beauty and lifestyle PERIOD

The general consensus is it is extremely important to blog about something you are passionate about PERIOD That is why there are so many different categories within blogging PERIOD

Every person has different interests which lead to different blogs PERIOD

Although each of these three women have studied journalism at Drake blogging is not only for those aspiring to be published PERIOD

Blogs are an incredible way to demonstrate your knowledge of and passion for a subject Tozer said PERIOD

Its a great way of documenting what youre up to what you like what you dont like Dickman said PERIOD

Especially in college blogging allows others to check in and continue to stay in touch with people they dont often get to see in person PERIOD

So toss aside your fears read these ladies blogs and create your own PERIOD
