8763,2023-01-18,"jan PERIOD  marked the beginning of a new chapter for Oregon as Tina Kotek took her place as Oregons thirty-ninth governor PERIOD A former state House speaker Kotek won the gubernatorial race by several percentage points over Republican Christine Drazan a former state legislator in Novembers election PERIOD Her inaugural address took place at the Oregon House of Chambers on a Monday afternoon PERIOD



At the forefront of her commitments Kotek declared a housing state of emergency an echo to her campaign promise of being more aggressive on the homelessness crisis within the state PERIOD Within her inaugural address Kotek said that aside from declaring a state of emergency she will also sign an executive order to push the state government to create  homes a yearan  percent increase over recent construction trends PERIOD



To meet trends of a burgeoning population Oregon needs to build more than  new housing units over the next two decades as state demographers and economists have estimated PERIOD



In a surprising callback to Governor Vic Atiyeh who served as Oregons thirty-second governor from  to  and was the last Republican governor in the state to date Kotek paraphrased his words in her inaugural address PERIOD



I have and will continue to listen and not just only to those people who have the means and the urgency to press their case in Salem Kotek said PERIOD I will be in your own communities not talking to you but meeting with you I will listen to you the elected representatives of our people and to the many dedicated workers in our government who truly want to serve people PERIOD I will listen to all. kotek referenced a conversation she had with a member of the Portland community who worked at a nonprofit shelter serving survivors of domestic and sexual violence PERIOD The shelter offers a safe place to stay but only temporarily PERIOD In this particular case the shelter would only provide housing for  days after which the survivors would be caught between a rock and a hard placeeither becoming homeless or going back to their abuser PERIOD



 days is often not long enough to find affordable permanent housing PERIOD In data presented by the Oregon Housing Stability Council the waiting lists for governmentsubsidized housing are several years long particularly in metro areas like Portland and its surrounding areas PERIOD A growing concern of safe affordable housing grips many Oregon residents not just those affected by domestic abuse PERIOD



Douglas Byrd an assistant professor of political science at Portland Community College offered another perspective PERIOD I think that theres multiple interesting aspects to Koteks inaugural address Byrd said PERIOD The first is that she said shed do this in the campaign and she has done it PERIOD The other thing is that it raises all sorts of questions that are very complex such as her being the speaker of the Oregon House for  years PERIOD That does raise questions why all of a sudden now that shes governor shes taking steps when it could have been taken many years ago. byrd wasnt the only one that has been asking that question PERIOD Even before the Democratic primary for Oregon governor questions were raised towards Kotek and her predecessor Kate Brown who share similar political profiles PERIOD Both hailing from Portland and the progressive wing of the party the two shared much in common not just in traits and ideals but also within the legislation PERIOD However fractures appeared between the two as Kotek distanced herself more from Brown as the latter faced scrutiny and a weak approval rating from the handling of the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD



The biggest question is how is the plan for solving the homeless crisis going to look Byrd said PERIOD The state legislature makes the decisions about these types of funding PERIOD Building all those homes sounds like a wonderful idea but its not clear to me or anyone how its going to be paid for and how its going to specifically address people living on the streets PERIOD How are they going to afford to live in these houses



Another concern among constituents is accountability within all branches of the state government PERIOD Questions were raised about where the money for building new homes will come from and the government has answered in the past PERIOD However Kotek noted that more could be done and promised to make government benefits and services more accessible and friendly to the public PERIOD



I am directing agency leadershipwith my supportto prioritize customer service Kotek said PERIOD That means being more efficient more effective and creating systems that will empower the states  public servants to deliver for Oregonians PERIOD So many state employees are working incredibly hard to do their jobs but struggle because of unnecessary bureaucratic barriers or outdated systems that do not meet the challenges of the day. for Portlanders homelessness remains at the forefront of many peoples minds PERIOD Just several months ago Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler passed a ban on homeless people around schools PERIOD



This is an existential crisis for the city Portland Byrd said PERIOD Anyone that has gone into the city in the last couple of years has noticed that significantly has seen a number of people on the street PERIOD The city center is going through a significant decline really I think the biggest issue for people is safety. kotek also emphasized strengthening connections across the state PERIOD She pledged to visit every county in Oregon within her first year of office PERIOD Kotek emphasized that by listening to one another finding more within details and coming together to create solutions the governance will be able to deliver results on complex issues currently affecting the state PERIOD



Towards the end of Koteks address the new governor welcomed the idea for people to help to participate with not only ideas for the future but also for the communities PERIOD In an echo to her previous comments of coming together united in the way forward Kotek made a call to action for all Oregonians to believe in our state and its future PERIOD



I hope theres some sort of ability to come with new leadership Byrd said PERIOD So maybe theres a zeitgeist and a feeling of a real possibility for change to be better PERIOD Not just for the people of Portland who are living in homes but perhaps also for the thousands of people who are living a daily nightmare maybe. reporter Abby Jobe contributed to this story PERIOD
