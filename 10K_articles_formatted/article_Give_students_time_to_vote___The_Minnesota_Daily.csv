One year from today Minneapolis voters will head to the polls to decide our president and every legislative seat down to local races and even a ballot measure or two PERIOD

Today let us consider the ways we can encourage our peers and ourselves to exercise our civic duty and ensure our voice is heard as a voting bloc PERIOD Today let us consider the value of giving students flexibility on Election Day to make time to vote PERIOD Election Day is not a holiday in the U.S. but it is every citizens right to vote PERIOD

This importance is already reflected in the Minnesota statute that allows every worker the ability to vote before noon without consequence or missed pay  our professors and administrators included PERIOD

There are currently many circumstances that may inhibit a students ability to get in line at their polling location commonly just a lack of time PERIOD From backtoback class to needing to vote in their home district as a commuter many students simply cannot schedule what is arguably the most important thing they could do on Election Day PERIOD

Minnesota has historically aboveaverage participation in elections students more so for presidential election years PERIOD As Minnesotans we need to be thoughtful about the ways we can foster this value and institutionalize access for every eligible voter  not just for  but for creating the habit of voting for the younger population PERIOD

With this year we have time to meaningfully evaluate the systems in place we can tailor to promote our right to vote PERIOD
