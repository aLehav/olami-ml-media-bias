Is anyone else freezing in here I looked over to my roommate PERIOD He was still wearing a pair of mesh shorts from his afternoon run and had a box fan blasting on him PERIOD Clearly something was wrong with me PERIOD

A thermometer is usually difficult to find in a fraternity house but the recent quarantine of another brother had put one just within reach PERIOD  degrees PERIOD A cough congestion fatigue and now a fever PERIOD Maybe I have the Swine Flu PERIOD

The thought of calling my mom that night did not even enter my mind PERIOD I knew better PERIOD Like any lovingly neurotic mother she had read every article and watched every nightly news piece about H1N1 as she always reminded me to call it PERIOD She ended every phone call with Have you washed your hands lately Did you remember to say the pledge of allegiance while you were doing it just to make the washing last long enough I can send you another bottle of hand sanitizer if you need it. i already thought she could hear me sneezing  miles away but if she knew I had a fever men in Hazmat suits would be knocking down my door PERIOD The phone call to my mom could wait PERIOD Instead I opted to sleep it off and see how I felt in the morning PERIOD

Of course in the morning I woke up shivering in a pool of sweat PERIOD It was time to call the Student Health Center PERIOD I asked to make an appointment but the receptionist said Im sorry but we are booked solid. i responded But I think I have the flu. somehow she was able to squeeze me in PERIOD

I sent my mom a text message as I made my way to the Health Center telling her I might have the flu PERIOD The waiting room was quiet except for the babble of a daytime soap opera and a sporadic chorus of coughing and snorting PERIOD

When the doctor saw me she said I just talked to your mother PERIOD She wanted to know how you were doing. the marvels of modern telecom and a relentless mother PERIOD The medical prognosis was Flulike symptoms. i asked if that meant I had the Swine Flu but the doctor explained that tests for H1N1 were unreliable PERIOD She told me I would be quarantined for at least two days PERIOD She recommended I relocate to one of the isolation rooms in Parker or in the old Phi Tau house PERIOD A Phi Tau house previously condemned for asbestos was not where I wanted to spend my next two days so I convinced her that my room was the perfect place to isolate me from society PERIOD

I thought I would go home with some Tamiflu or some oinkment sorry but instead the doctor gave me a bottle of Tylenol PERIOD Swine flu and Tylenol I guess its no big deal PERIOD She handed me a blue surgical mask and told me to put it on PERIOD A Campus Safety van was waiting outside to take me back to my room PERIOD The Campus Safety officer was not as chatty as usual PERIOD I couldnt blame him PERIOD He didnt have a mask PERIOD

My fever had already subsided when I returned to my room PERIOD As I sat up in my bed emailing my professors text messages started pouring in PERIOD A cousin who lives in Ecuador sent me a text I hear you might have the porky. in a matter of hours my mom had successfully made my quarantine an international incident PERIOD Over the next two days I had soup watched the movie Defiance read my political science textbook and negotiated new due dates with professors PERIOD My concerned roommates kept their distance and made sure to use wet wipes on all the room remotes PERIOD By the end of my two days of solitude I felt almost  percent PERIOD I was ready to emerge from isolation and reenter society PERIOD Just in time for dollar draft night PERIOD

But what had I learned from my life in quarantine First prevention and good hygiene probably are good advice even when we live in places that are less than models of perfect hygiene PERIOD Second texting your mom is not necessarily a bad idea PERIOD Third having good friends is a big asset when you need soup and some class notes PERIOD Fourth quick response makes sense even if things turn out to be less than critical PERIOD Finally and most importantly if you have a thermometer to share with friends make sure it is an oral one PERIOD
