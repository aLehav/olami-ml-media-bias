Firing up the grill whether youre cooking for friends or family is without doubt the best way to get your outdoor entertaining started PERIOD The smell of charcoal the sizzle of grilled meats and of course the grills favorite vegetable  fresh sweet corn on the cob  nothing else welcomes the season quite so pleasantly PERIOD

Fresh sweet corn is in season now and available at your supermarket PERIOD If you buy it in the husk put it straight onto the grill for a super easy and healthy vegetable side PERIOD Trim the silks and pull back the outer layers of husk to avoid flareups PERIOD The corn will steam beautifully in  to  minutes PERIOD If you prefer a fireroasted flavor try shucking the ears before brushing them lightly with oil and placing them directly on the grill PERIOD Or if you buy them already husked but dont like them charred wrap ears in foil before adding them to the grill PERIOD

While fresh sweet corn is delicious all on its own or simply slathered in butter and sprinkled with sea salt there are plenty of ways to dress it up and pair it just perfectly with your main dishes PERIOD

Teriyaki is a great marinade for chicken and steak so for some Asian inspiration try Grilled Corn with Sesamesoy Sauce PERIOD This ingenious recipe uses the corn husk as a sort of envelope sealing in the delicious flavor of soy sesame and lime that brings out the corns natural sweetness PERIOD
