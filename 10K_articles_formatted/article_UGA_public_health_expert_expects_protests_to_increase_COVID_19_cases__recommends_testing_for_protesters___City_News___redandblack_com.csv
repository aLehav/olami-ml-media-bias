Protestors gather to protest police brutality in downtown Athens Georgia on Sunday May   PERIOD PhotoJason Born

On Wednesday District  AthensClarke County Commissioner Mariah Parker announced she had tested positive for COVID19 PERIOD Just three days prior she led a protest of about  people through downtown Athens PERIOD

The protest the largest Athens has seen in years was one of hundreds occurring around the country against racial injustice and the deaths of black people at the hands of police PERIOD In addition to marching around downtown Parker led chants using a megaphone that Mayor Kelly Girtz and activists spoke into PERIOD

Grace Bagwell Adams is an associate professor at the University of Georgias College of Public Health where she also serves as the assistant dean for outreach engagement and equity PERIOD She expects cases to increase in the wake of protests on a national scale and here in Athens PERIOD

I totally understand and respect an individuals first amendment right to peacefully protest for certain Adams said PERIOD However she also emphasized that it was the job of public officials and protest organizers to take a public health approach to managing protests PERIOD

There have been more than  cases of COVID19 in Georgia so far with  deaths in the state according to the Georgia Department of Public Health PERIOD

Adams said testing centers in Athens are experiencing overload in the wake of the protests  four to five hour waits at sites that just a week ago had virtually no wait PERIOD Still she strongly recommended that anyone who plans to attend a protest get preemptively tested to prevent the spread of the virus and to get tested again after the protest PERIOD

The risk for contracting the coronavirus is exponentially greater for those who gather in large groups Adams said adding that chants and shouts have the risk of expelling viral droplets which can increase the spread of the virus PERIOD

Tests are most accurate in detecting the virus five to seven days after exposure Adams said PERIOD Due to the time it takes to analyze test results and report them to officials it may be two to three weeks before official case counts reflect the effects of the protests PERIOD

A smaller group of protesters has gathered near the Arch every day this week to continue protesting with the crowd size ranging from a couple dozen to around  PERIOD A demonstration planned for this Saturday will likely attract a much larger crowd  a Facebook event for the protest has  users going with  interested on Friday PERIOD

The protest is organized by the Athens AntiDiscrimination Movement PERIOD The organizations founder Mokah Jasmine Johnson sent out a press release on June  saying the protest would proceed as planned with public health measures planned PERIOD

The event will take place at City Hall and will not include marching so that attendees can more effectively social distance PERIOD People who believe they have the coronavirus those who are immunocompromised and the elderly are discouraged from attending PERIOD Protesters are encouraged to wear masks and stay  feet apart and onsite medical stations will be set up to provide hand sanitizer and masks PERIOD

Around midnight on May  AthensClarke County Police Department officers used tear gas to disperse about  protesters who were assembled near the Arch remnants of the large protest earlier in the evening PERIOD ACCPDs decision to use tear gas and projectiles as well as inconsistencies between protester accounts and the police narrative has been hotly debated in Athens this week PERIOD

According to the Associated Press Emory University infectious disease specialist Dr PERIOD Jay Varkey said in a Friday news conference that the use of tear gas worries him as it causes people to rub their eyes PERIOD ProPublica has also reported that tear gas can cause lung damage that makes people more susceptible to infection and more difficult for the body to recover from COVID19 PERIOD

More than anything Adams stressed that people keep the risks of a pandemic in mind even while the news cycle is dominated by protest coverage PERIOD

For so long we were all singularly focused on COVID and now there has been a big switch especially national and state and local media last week on the protests but we have to remember that these things are happening at the same time Adams said PERIOD While its difficult we really have to make sure that we are still considering how to support and promote the publics health. a June  memo from AthensClarke County Police Department Chief Cleveland Spruill to Assista
