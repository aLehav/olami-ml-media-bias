By  Lynnette Tibbott Staff Columnist September  

I was  years old when I got my first customer service job PERIOD I had my interview in the squeaky plastic booths of a small towns frozen custard shop PERIOD I even wore dark pants and a thick blouse despite the 80degree weather just because I wanted to make a good impression for my firstever interview PERIOD

After a few weeks of working I experienced my first fiasco PERIOD

There was one older gentleman who ordered at the store claiming to have an online coupon. i explained to him that due to store policy I could not accept it PERIOD

If Marvel was making a new Hulk movie at the time I would have begged them to cast this man PERIOD The vein in his neck began to twitch PERIOD His face blushed red PERIOD His beady eyes locked on me PERIOD And then he started to yell PERIOD I dont even remember what he said to me but it was along the lines of me being an idiot that he needed to talk to my boss and that he always used online coupons before PERIOD

As time progressed I realized how entitled customers can behave PERIOD A customer told me that her sundae didnt have enough hot fudge PERIOD Another told me that they wanted their order in a cup instead of a cone PERIOD Its not that they asked me to fix it I didnt care about that PERIOD Its how they did it  by disrespecting me PERIOD To them I was not a person  I was a worker PERIOD I was someone they could demean PERIOD

As a worker I understand that customers are trying to get what they paid for PERIOD As a customer I understand workers are doing their best PERIOD Because of my experience as both I know how to be empathetic in either situation PERIOD In a world so focused on money everyone chooses to spend it and earn it as they see fit PERIOD However the divide between worker and customer keeps growing PERIOD

People stigmatize and degrade certain jobs especially in customer service food service and janitorial jobs PERIOD These jobs are considered undesirable but why Theyre necessary positions and we all rely on the services these people offer PERIOD Customer service workers arent doctors lawyers or other jobs that earn automatic respect but theyre still just as important in terms of keeping society functioning PERIOD

I believe the basis of job stigmatization stems from our societal need to get ahead of everyone else PERIOD Were taught from a young age that we need to rise above the rest. we learn that maybe with hard work unwavering dedication and picking ourselves up by our bootstraps we will finally get there  but that reality is much less tangible than people realize PERIOD

Theres no denying that high paying jobs are justifiably valued PERIOD Higher paying jobs tend to require more education and specialized training PERIOD The difference comes at the level of replaceability of the employee PERIOD A skilled brain surgeon is hard to find whereas a customer service worker comes at a dime a dozen PERIOD Youre not special to an employer but thats all the more reason to work a customer service job PERIOD

You might think replaceability is bad but I think this is a misconception PERIOD I learned quickly that my replaceability worked to my benefit PERIOD Unless youre extremely lucky most employers will take advantage of you and continue to do so unless you stand up for yourself and set boundaries PERIOD You can care for your bosses and managers but understand that telling them no is not a reflection on your personal relationship with them PERIOD Dont let your employers guilt you because ultimately youre working for the betterment of an establishment that doesnt care for you and will exploit you if given the chance PERIOD Replaceability teaches you to stick up for yourself PERIOD I learned that so many people were like me  they had the same education qualifications skillset and mindset PERIOD No one is special or above others in that way PERIOD

When you strip a person of their money and their title you see that they too are made of skin and bone PERIOD All people deserve the same respect and some customers need to stop acting like theyre better or above the workers that are providing them with a service PERIOD

Customer service workers serve the public but theyre still individuals with their own wants needs and grievances PERIOD Maybe a worker is struggling with a family issue yet theyre forced to work through it PERIOD Maybe these workers were there for over eight hours with no break or maybe theyre just experiencing the burn of being a cog in the neverending machine of working society PERIOD You never know what someone is going through  thats why no one has a right to treat a worker poorly PERIOD

As terrible as working customer service is there is also a sense of happiness and community in working these types of jobs PERIOD Ive talked to some of the kindest people working in customer service PERIOD Customers would go out of their way to compliment or ask me questions or even sympathize with me during a shift PERIOD In turn I often go out of my way for these types of people PERIOD I got to know people to laugh with them even if it were just for a few minutes PERIOD Sometimes that small but meaningful conversation is enough to brighten both of our days PERIOD

Everyone is a customer and everyone is a worker PERIOD It seems like often we forget what its like on the other side when we get to clock out at the end of a shift PERIOD You need to know what its like walking in someone elses shoes PERIOD If you dont how can you ever understand others

Its easy enough to say that America has a problem with employee exploitation but until youve actually spent time learning the experiences and working in these situations you will never fully understand PERIOD

Thats not to say that a customer service job is a permanent career for everyone though even if it is they are still worthy of the same amount of respect and dignity as anyone else PERIOD All Im saying is that every American needs to work a customer service job at least once in their life however fleeting PERIOD Its the first step in empathy and understanding in a society so foundationalized in the financial and classist divide among all Americans PERIOD

Now more than ever we need compassion PERIOD Stop furthering the job hierarchy PERIOD
