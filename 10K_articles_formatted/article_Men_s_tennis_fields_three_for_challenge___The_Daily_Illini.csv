With their teammates playing in the prestigious AllAmerican tournament this weekend it will be left to three Illinois tennis players to represent the team at the inaugural Scott Treibly College Tennis Challenge in Bradenton Fla PERIOD

Junior Brandon Davis sophomore Marc Spicijaric and freshman Billy Heiser will play in the tournament which features stiff competition from across the country PERIOD The event will begin with roundrobin play within two pools consisting of four teams each PERIOD The best two teams from each pool will advance to face each other in singleelimination matches to decide a champion PERIOD

The Challenge represents a change of plans for the Illini who were originally scheduled to miss the entire week while playing in the qualifying rounds of the AllAmerican tournament PERIOD But head coach Brad Dancer decided to send only Kevin Anderson and Ryan Rowe who were guaranteed spots in the main draw PERIOD Dancer said the other players would be better served getting more guaranteed matches and spending the entire week in the classroom PERIOD

We want to maximize the playing opportunities for a minimum amount of class time Dancer said PERIOD The guys were taking down to Florida will all get five matches in which is great experience and theyre only going to miss one day of class. heiser said he was disappointed to miss the first national tournament of his college career but said he needed more work before taking on topflight competition PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

Im still working on a few things and maybe Im not quite ready yet Heiser said PERIOD Its definitely disappointing but this is a good chance to catch up on schoolwork PERIOD Im looking forward to getting in a lot of matches. heiser has started his first season well notching a pair of victories in his first two collegiate matches at the Napa Valley Invitational PERIOD Davis and Spicijaric played last weekend at the Cincinnati Collegiate Invitational where they went  as a doubles team and found mixed results in singles play PERIOD Davis is  in singles on the young season and Spicijaric will look to improve on a  mark PERIOD

The Illinis opening pool features matches against Florida Kentucky and Armstrong State PERIOD If the team advances from their pool they will need to win one more match to reach the final on Sunday PERIOD

The tournament will take place at the Bollettieri Tennis Academy which has gained prominence as the training ground for professional stars like Maria Sharapova and Andre Agassi PERIOD But this event which Illinois is cosponsoring with the tennis academy will be the first team college tournament held there Dancer said PERIOD

Its a great opportunity for us to get some exposure at the academy Dancer said PERIOD Its a lot of matches and the guys are going to be exhausted but Im excited about it.",Men's tennis fields three for challenge - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
