Anthony Breen an entrepreneur was faced with a dilemma many college students face late one Friday night what and where to eat PERIOD

Breen decided to create an app that could help make his decision PERIOD

This app available for Apple and Android devices is called Feasty and was launched on March  PERIOD

Using geolocation the app is able to locate nearby restaurants with exclusive limited deals PERIOD

These deals are all free unlike Groupon which requires purchase in order to use PERIOD

Breen a Xavier alumnus promoted the app with a large discount for Xavier students at the Montgomery Inn Boathouse PERIOD

The event was exclusively for people who use the Feasty app Zeina Farhat a campus advisor for Feasty said PERIOD Within  hours people had ordered all  tickets. the coupon granted a buffet style meal for those who obtained the ticket with additional coupons for drinks PERIOD

Students enjoyed the discounted meal on March  which was set to celebrate Xaviers position in the NCAA basketball tournament PERIOD

The app is currently well reviewed on both the Google Play and the iTunes store with a five star review PERIOD

Though partially due to the sparsity in reviews a total of nine between the two sites reactions to the app have been generally positive PERIOD

Whats not to like about it College students can get a bang for their buck and the app is connected to local businesses such as Danas to offer free or heavily discounted items Farhat said PERIOD

The app is designed for ease of use with users only required to scroll through a page for discounts PERIOD

These discounts come in various forms and are usually connected to local businesses PERIOD

However not all reviews are positive with one student voicing the belief that it doesnt vary enough from other apps PERIOD

Most of the deals are OTR and I dont go down there that often Cecilia Nonis said PERIOD I can pretty much just follow twitter accounts to get good discounts. httpswww.instagram.comxavier.newswire
