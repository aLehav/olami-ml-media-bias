Dozens of NFL scouts and members of the media gathered to watch the athletes bounce a barbell off their chests jump as high andor far as they could and sprint  yards as fast as possible PERIOD

Its one long interview PERIOD Everyones evaluating constantly and youve got a lot of eyes on you so you definitely just got to carry yourself with a lot of professionalism said former Gophers linebacker and NFL draft hopeful Blake Cashman PERIOD At the end of the day youve got to get a team to like you and hopefully youll land on a roster. in the bench press section of the pro day three former Gophers players took part PERIOD Defensive lineman Gary Moore had the most reps with  while linebacker Julian Huff had  and his defensive back identical twin brother Jacob Huff pushed out  PERIOD

Jacob Huff ran an unofficial 40yard dash time of . leading the Gophers in that section of the event on Wednesday PERIOD Jacob Huff said he trained in Texas while Julian Huff stayed in Minnesota working a new job and training in his free time PERIOD The two combined for  tackles in their careers with the Gophers PERIOD

First time being away from him that was kind of rough said Jacob Huff PERIOD But it was good for the long run because I learned a lot about myself and being away from him Im sure he got time to process what he wants to do and what he wants to be in life. cashman and offensive lineman Donnell Greene two senior players from the  season who decided to sit out the Quick Lane Bowl to prepare for the NFL draft were in attendance PERIOD They sat out the measurable portion of the event but participated in the drills that involved game scenarios like catching blocking and moving around the field PERIOD

Cashman is predicted to go in the third round of the NFL Draft by a CBS Mock Draft and in the second round by USA Todays Draft Wire PERIOD He attracted attention at the NFL Combine after posting an official . second 40yard dash time at the NFL combine PERIOD

Kicker Emmit Carpenter was the only Gophers special teams player at the combine PERIOD Fouryear starting long snapper Payton Jordahl was not at the pro day deciding to move on from football after his career with the Gophers ended PERIOD

Hes by far the best long snapper that Ive ever encountered Carpenter said PERIOD Hes chasing his passion outside of football and I know hes really happy doing that. defensive backs Adekunle Ayinde and Duke McGhee two alumni who finished their Gophers careers in  were also in attendance PERIOD McGhee said he had been substitute teaching at his old high school Cedar Grove and landscaping in his home state of Georgia while preparing for the pro day PERIOD He didnt participate in the events last year because of an injury PERIOD
