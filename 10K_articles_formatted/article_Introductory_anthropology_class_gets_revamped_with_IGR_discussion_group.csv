One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

The University Insider is The Dailys first faculty and stafforiented newsletter PERIOD This weekly newsletter will give UMfaculty and staff the ability to see the most important issues on campus and in Ann Arbor  particularly those related to administrative decisions  from the perspective of an independent news organization PERIOD It will also provide a better understanding of student perspectives PERIOD





One of the most popular classes that fulfills the Race and Ethnicity requirement Cultural Anthropology  or Introduction to Anthropology is moving away from its previous honors discussion course to pilot a new section similar to the Program on Intergroup Relations this upcoming winter semester PERIOD

Last spring students filed their grievances toward the previously alteredRace and Ethnicity requirement highlighting that major lectures including Cultural Anthropology  and History  merely graze over these topics and make vague connections to race and ethnicity rather than a structured focus. the problem they reported was the size of these classes hindered the students ability to cultivate effective and critical discussions PERIOD Students sought a more consolidated class where race and ethnicity was the main thread PERIOD

LSA sophomore Hannah Walsh said she found this problem to be present within her race and ethnicity course History  Introduction to Religion PERIOD

I was really excited to learn more about different religions cultures and different parts of the world and how everyone thinks and acts differently  which is what the requirement is for Walsh said PERIOD Yet I learned about Christianity cults and other random vague terms that did not fit one religion or another PERIOD It was all very abstract I came out knowing how to define sacred and profane but not even learning the slightest bit of history about Buddhism or Islam. with these problems in mind Stephanie Hicks a lecturer within the Program of Intergroup Relations reached out to Cultural Anthropology prof PERIOD Jason De Leon to find a way to foster more centralized discussion and to provide a more dialogic experience within their courses PERIOD

IGR is unique because it allows students to learn in different ways as it isnt a traditional lecture course Hicks said PERIOD Students get to engage with experimental learning they get to take part in various activities they get to focus on their own learning experiences  so I think there is a real possibility to help the students understand the concepts theyre learning in Anthro in a really different way. taking into consideration the current political climate De Leonwho won a coveted MacArthur genius grant last year for his research on immigration believes the new discussion section will not only be more beneficial toward students looking to create connections between race and ethnicity and anthropology but will also help the University as a whole in its attempt to create a more inclusive and diverse community PERIOD

In general I think more sustained and official venues that can provide students an opportunity to discuss issues od Diversity Equity and Inclusion are always needed especially in this current political climate De Leon wrote in an email to The Daily PERIOD The University of Michigan is committed to improving student and staff exposure to these issues and this new course addition is but one of many steps needed to reach their goals of having a student body that reflects the demographics of the country as a whole and one that is prepared for understanding why diversity and inclusion is important and how we can best foster positive social change. this collaboration of IGR and Race and Ethnicity requirement classes is the first of its kind PERIOD Lecturer Thomas Chivens who teaches sections of Cultural Anthropology  believes this synthesis will function successfully because of Anthropologys wide scope of topics PERIOD

Its an interdisciplinary program but at the level of pedagogyChivens said PERIOD At the University we blend history and sociology or well bring together political science and social studies but this is really kind of different PERIOD It brings this kind of dialogic pedagogy that has been developed to whatever is appropriate into the sections PERIOD IGR specifically works really well with the themes of our class in terms of the topics we are addressing such as origins and the routes of social inequality the production of cultural differences where social identities come from and then weave that into these identity categories like kinship gender and religion. anthropology is a multifaceted topic of study PERIOD It has four subdisciplines archaeological biological cultural and linguistic anthropology PERIOD Because of this some students like LSA sophomore Joey Carpenter are apprehensive about the discussion section as it seems topics of social justice and social identity do not necessarily correlate with the holistic nature of anthropology itself PERIOD

I dont think that such a focused discussion is the best idea mainly because the class is so comprehensive Carpenter said PERIOD The mandatory discussions already open conversations about the topics as they are introduced in lecture throughout the semester PERIOD The class covered everything from evolution and archaeology to debunking the societal concept of gender. however Chivens makes note of this potential issue PERIOD Though this section will attempt to centralize discussions of race and ethnicity it will still function as a standard discussion section PERIOD Moreover there will be  or so conventional discussion sections if the IGR section does not interest students PERIOD

Stephanie and I will develop some discussion point pieces Chivens said PERIOD Its complimentary to IGR but its not one and the same PERIOD At the end of the day its still an Anthro  discussion group PERIOD We have to be fair to the students it has to be kind of a hybrid as theyre still going to want to do exam review PERIOD Plus there are other topics that dont exactly fit into race and ethnicity like the origins of agriculture PERIOD This is a pilot so we can adjust we can take what works and develop it PERIOD We can take what doesnt work and reflect on it PERIOD But overall Im excited to see how it goes. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
