2742,2007-11-29,"walking across campus near Lake Mendota on a sunny Sunday afternoon its hard to ignore the thunderous cacophony reverberating from the tower standing in front of the Social Sciences building on Observatory Drive PERIOD

If lucky enough to be on time listeners have the unique opportunity of experiencing firsthand the source of the weekly music PERIOD After climbing several flights of steep winding stairways those adventurous enough encounter not a modern computerized music machine but a whitehaired man perched at the top of the tower PERIOD

Since  Lyle Anderson has been the carillonneur who has made the hike up to the top of the carillon tower and performed a weekly program from  to  p.m PERIOD

 Anderson said while sitting below the gigantic bells suspended above PERIOD 

Anderson is currently preparing for his annual Christmas music program hell be performing this Sunday from  to  p.m PERIOD

 Anderson said PERIOD

Anderson said he became interested in the organlike instrument while studying linguistics at the University of Wisconsin in the 1960s PERIOD He then pursued further training at the Netherlands Carillon School in Amersfoort in  PERIOD

As a parttime academic staff member of UW Anderson is compensated for his weekly performances by the School of Music PERIOD

 School of Music Director John Schaffer said PERIOD 

Anderson said unlike his Dutch colleagues who play the centuriesold machine he doesnt have a practice instrument and doesnt make a full career out of playing PERIOD

 Anderson said PERIOD 

Making the magic happen

Anderson said he is continually astounded when people visit the tower and witness how he is producing the music and still ask him where the computer system is making the sound PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

Sitting on a bench in front of a keyboardlike machine Anderson uses the bottoms of his fists to depress wooden handles attached to steel lines that cause a round  to ring the  bells ranging from  to nearly  pounds PERIOD

 Anderson said PERIOD 

David Johnson carilloneur at House of Hope Presbyterian Church in St PERIOD Paul Minn. said he has known Anderson for more than  years and said it takes a special person to develop the skills to play accurately and creatively PERIOD

 Johnson said PERIOD 

Unlike a piano keyboard however Anderson said most carillon keyboards are one of a kind and players need to adapt to the feel of each setup differently PERIOD

UW freshman Bob Manier made the ascent Sunday afternoon to marvel at the production of the music PERIOD

 Manier shouted as he stood at the breezy belfry of the tower PERIOD 

Despite there being only handfuls of carillon towers around the nation and only three in Wisconsin Anderson said there is a multitude of music composed for the instrument and even more can be transcribed from other instruments PERIOD

 Anderson said PERIOD 

Anderson said he used to take time to select an organized program for his  to  p.m PERIOD performance but realized his audience was mainly composed of passersby who wouldnt notice and he now  and plays them PERIOD

The mechanics

Since the instrument is subjected to all types of Wisconsin weather Anderson said the carillon is unique that it is in no way fragile but is made to be very expressive with a wide range of pitches and volumes PERIOD

Anderson makes small adjustments by hand on the steel wires connecting the keyboard with the clappers to ensure it is striking the bell at the bottom of his key stroke PERIOD

 Anderson said PERIOD 

Main tunings are done at the bell factory according to Anderson who said it is a marvel that engineers  years ago needed to determine how to bring the bell in tune with itself as well as with the other bells by trial and error PERIOD

 Anderson said PERIOD 

Anderson said when the bell is cast it is out of tune and then metal is extracted from the inside of the bell to make it the correct weight PERIOD

 Anderson said PERIOD 

A storied past

Early in the twentieth century university officials decided to add chime bells to the dome then atop Bascom Hall PERIOD The dome burned in a  fire destroying the bells PERIOD Alumni from  to  set out to reconstruct the dome and its music but changed their plans in  to construct the freestanding tower that stands today PERIOD

The tower was initially equipped with  bells from an English foundry costing approximately  or nearly half a million dollars today PERIOD

By the late 1950s most music was being written for four octaves instead of the three the tower was equipped for so in  the carillon was expanded with  Frenchmade bells to  PERIOD

In  the carillon was overhauled and a nearly 7000pound  bell was added replacing the 3000pound anchor that was moved to become a swinging bell rung by thenGov PERIOD Tommy Thompson on the stairs of the Capitol as part of the Sesquicentennial celebration in  PERIOD

 Anderson said PERIOD 

UW sophomore Laura Egli said her second trip to the belfry last Sunday was still impressive as the sound echoes through the Lakeshore neighborhood PERIOD

 Egli said PERIOD 

Johnson said there is a common misconception that carillon performances are dwindling and noted the several new towers that have been constructed in recent years throughout the world PERIOD

 Johnson said PERIOD
