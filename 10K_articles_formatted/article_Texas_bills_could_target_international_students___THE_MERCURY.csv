9577,2023-04-03,"texas lawmakers in Austin have introduced a series of bills that could affect university funding minority groups and higher education PERIOD

Restrictions on transgender athletes bans on certain foreign citizens attending college bans on election polls on campus improving mental health ending tenures and improving teacher retirement plans are just a few of the bill topics making headlines PERIOD

While UTD does not currently have any transgender student athletes Senate Bill  proposes that all current and future athletes attending public universities must compete in teams aligning with the sex they were assigned at birth PERIOD The bill follows new guidelines from the National Collegiate Athletes Association or NCAA saying female athletes cannot exceed a certain testosterone level PERIOD SB  also runs alongside other antitransgender bills in Texas including the very similar Save Womens Sports act that will affect all public institutions and the recentlypassed Senate Bill  that will ban minors from transitioning on taxpayer money and prevent mental health professionals from endorsing their transition PERIOD SB  requires that the university pay a fee if caught violating this rule PERIOD It also however proposes that all public universities will must allow female students to compete in equal intercollegiate competitions designed for men if an alternative is not already offered PERIOD

Senate Bill  which was passed March  has over  authors and is supported by Gov PERIOD Greg Abbot who said that transgender women hold an unfair biological advantage in sports compared to cisgender women PERIOD

Weve fought for the rights of women to be able to succeed in the world only to have that now superseded by this ideology that men are going to be empowered to compete against women in things that should be protected by federal law state law Abbot said PERIOD

Another bill that has racked up controversy is House Bill  which prevents international students from China Iran North Korea or Russia from enrolling in a public school PERIOD Additionally the bill proposes that citizenship will no longer be obtainable even if they graduate high school after living in Texas for three years PERIOD This bill would apply to H1B Visa Holders students and refugees and it parallels Senate Bill  which was endorsed by Abbott to prevent foreign citizens from buying land PERIOD While the bill has a low chance of passing and has only been referred to State Affairs so far its proposal has sparked concern for several groups PERIOD

Meanwhile House Bill  and House Bill  propose a bill that prohibits schools from hosting polling sites PERIOD Both bills claim their goal is to keep outsiders off campuses during voting days PERIOD However critics point out that the bills would create added difficulties for students to exercise their voting rights and target locations often associated with Democrat turnout PERIOD

The bill was referred to Elections on March  for HB  but the author of both bills Representative Carrie Isaac is adamant that these bills will protect students PERIOD

Theres a lot of opportunity there for people to be places they shouldnt be Isaac said PERIOD I just know in this session this is going to be a topic we cover intensely school safety PERIOD I just believe these are a couple areas we can improve on. another bill following Uvalde is House Bill  which encourages teachers to undergo training to identify individuals with mental health issues that could pose a school shooting risk PERIOD Additionally campuses will have to prepare an active shooter plan if one is not already in place and the budget allotment for student safety will increase to  per student PERIOD

HB  would accompany an increase funding for the Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium for schoolbased telehealth care which came after Texas Childrens Hospital reported an  increase in mental illnesses late last year PERIOD UTD is expected to be one of the institutions providing health care professionals to address the growing mental health crisis with Congress funding a telehealth care program at UTD last year.HB  was left pending on March  in the Texas House Select Committee on Youth Health and Safety PERIOD

While these bills primarily affect university students faculty and staff can also expect changes PERIOD Senate Bill  would effectively end the tenure program starting Sept PERIOD  if passed PERIOD Critics argue that this bill would diminish the pool of quality faculty and would target critical race theory which Lt PERIOD Gov PERIOD Dan Patrick has repeatedly expressed opposition to PERIOD Supporters point out that this bill removes a seniority hierarchy that has previously been abused and that it will allow more opportunities for younger educators PERIOD Meanwhile House Bill  Senate Bill  and Senate Bill  are all expected to improve educator retirement plans and costs of living PERIOD Additionally SB  would provide incentives for retired teachers to return to teaching and provide mentorship programs to help the next generation of educators PERIOD

As of March  SB  has been approved and passed PERIOD HB  has been voted favorably after amendments SB  is awaiting vote results and SB  is pending under an education subcommittee PERIOD
