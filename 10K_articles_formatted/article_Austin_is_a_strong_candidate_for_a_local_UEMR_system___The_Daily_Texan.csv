5909,2023-07-11,"as new focus turns toward Dell Medical School and its associated hospital network Austin has become a burgeoning biotech hotspot PERIOD As part of this boom many startups have dedicated themselves to bringing the world a universal electronic medical records or UEMR system PERIOD The creation of such a system would promise shorter ER wait times more comprehensive patient history and medical details and more efficient insurance billing PERIOD

But before the UEMR system could encompass an area as large as a state or country one must consider if such systems have been successful on a smaller scale and particularly if it could benefit the Austin area PERIOD

San Francisco another technological hub has begun its switch to UEMR PERIOD The system eliminates the clerical burden of sending records to specialists across the metropolitan area and redundant billing saving money for both clinics and patients PERIOD More importantly it makes doctors jobs more efficient PERIOD In larger hospital systems or clinical networks emergency care clinicians can easily access patient history and information sometimes even before the patient is on the premises PERIOD Doctors who are privy to allergies or underlying conditions in a critical care patient can treat them more effectively and mitigate the chance for a complication PERIOD

The benefits of such a system seem obvious but the difficulties in implementation of such a system are far more meticulous PERIOD For example in San Francisco the switch to UEMR was championed by private companies who took on clients individually adding each hospital or clinic to its network PERIOD Of course there were multiple companies who went about acquiring business in this way and this resulted in San Francisco being split by various EMR systems that were unable to communicate with one another PERIOD In the rush to implement the UEMR system for the city companies lost track of the most important part of the acronym universal PERIOD

IT companies are out of touch with the reality of health care PERIOD They should collaborate with doctors like Dr PERIOD Charles Sninsky who can foresee roadblocks to UEMR implementation PERIOD

Without a unified system each provider whether they be a hospital an HMO system or a private practice will have their own solution and the end result will be similar to the current problem incompatibility of systems and the inability to share information Sninsky predicted in the medical journal Gastronterology and Hepatology PERIOD

Implementation alone is not the largest cost PERIOD Maintaining the server system and controlling the database require recurring IT costs that must be either footed by the health care system or unloaded on to the patient offsetting the potentially moneysaving benefits of the UEMR system PERIOD

However even with the knowledge of these potential pitfalls Austin would make an excellent candidate for a local UEMR system PERIOD Austin is the main medical hub for the Central Texas area and is serviced by a few large hospital networks PERIOD A coalition of these hospitals would have the power to push for the implementation of such a system perhaps in tandem with the city or Travis County Health and Human Services PERIOD Contracting IT companies for this service could be done quite easily PERIOD Experts like Sninsky conclude that such UEMR implementation would require government involvement to fund and regulate its inception PERIOD

A nurse from Dell Childrens Hospital Blood and Cancer Center who preferred to remain anonymous affirms that UEMR would be invaluable in places like the ER PERIOD Even in a clinic it can be difficult to record all the different specialists and tests a patient has gone through before arriving at Dell PERIOD How we treat our patients heavily depends on a thorough patient history the nurse said PERIOD Im not sure what something like this would cost but if it helps the patient I believe its worth it. batlanki is a neuroscience sophomore from Flower Mound.Follow him on Twitter RohanBatlanki PERIOD
