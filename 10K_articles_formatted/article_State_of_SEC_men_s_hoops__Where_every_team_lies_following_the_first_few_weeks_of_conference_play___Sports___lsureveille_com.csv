LSU mens basketball junior guard Cam Hayes  and sophomore guard Justice Williams  guard their opponent on Wednesday Jan PERIOD   during LSUs  loss against Auburn in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge La PERIOD

The SEC took a huge hit in last seasons NCAA tournament following what had previously been a competitive and exciting regular season PERIOD Despite entering the tournament with six teams seeded six and above just three teams advanced to the second round with one of those surviving longer than that in Arkansas PERIOD

Still the conference once again drew lofty expectations heading into the  season PERIOD Of the six teams that represented it in last seasons tournament five were expected to remain highly competitive PERIOD

Tennessee maintained most of its roster from last season a season where it won the SEC Tournament PERIOD Kentucky kept arguably the best player in the country in Oscar Tshiebwe and surrounded him with the sixth best  recruiting class in the country PERIOD Arkansas and Alabama pulled in the nations second and fourth best recruiting classes respectively and are in the midst of massive turnarounds and Auburn wasnt projected too far behind them despite losing two first rounders PERIOD Of those five SI predicted two could contend for a title in Kentucky and Arkansas PERIOD

Behind them Florida and Texas AM were expected to improve and make the tournament while LSU was projected to be a bubble team coming in one of the conferences biggest mysteries PERIOD Though firstyear head coach Matt McMahon effectively pieced its roster together it was difficult to gauge how this team would perform PERIOD

And lastly the bottom of the barrel featured the likes of Georgia Vanderbilt Missouri Ole Miss and South Carolina with Mississippi State barely escaping that distinction PERIOD

With that all being said what do we know now that were about halfway through the  regular season

The Surprises

While Arkansas was initially projected as a championship contender thats not the potential thats been displayed through the first third of its conference schedule PERIOD Following a nearly perfect stint in nonconference play it dropped five of its first six SEC contests and didnt lookgreat while doing it PERIOD

It has valid excuses with two key contributors in Nick Smith Jr PERIOD and Trevon Brazile out for an extended period of time and its schedule featuring four matchups against teams in the top half of the conference PERIOD But given what weve seen so far this team may have a hard time making the tournament even if Smith returns PERIOD

Kentucky has had a similar start to the season but hasnt struggled quite as much as the Razorbacks especially over the past week PERIOD While Tshiebwe has remained a force him being shut down has typically resulted in a Wildcat loss most evident in its matchup against Alabama where Tshiebwe scored four points and they lost by  PERIOD

At its worst Kentucky sat at a  record with three SEC losses and was expected to drop a fourth game on the road against No PERIOD  Tennessee PERIOD But that didnt happen PERIOD

LSU womens basketball was certainly tested Thursday night at the PMAC PERIOD The Tigers escaped with a  win against Arkansas giving them thei

The Wildcats bounced back defeating the perceived secondbest team in the conference then followed that up with a doubledigit win over Georgia a few nights later PERIOD They now have a  conference record and enter a lessthanintimidating stretch of SEC matchups with momentum PERIOD Its hard to gauge if this teams struggles are over but its outlook certainly looks better than it did the prior week as it slowly navigates the bubble PERIOD

On the other side of things projected bottomfeeders Missouri and Georgia have exceeded expectations PERIOD They have already surpassed their win totals from last season and each possesses wins that could help them make the tournament in March PERIOD

Georgia was one of the worst teams in the Power Six last season winning six games and just one in conference play PERIOD Under firstyear head coach Mike White it has already accomplished more than double what it did then entering conference play with  wins and defeating three of its first five SEC opponents one of which was a doubledigit victory over No PERIOD  Auburn PERIOD

Missouri is currently projected as an eightseed in the NCAA Tournament and though its hype has died down over the last two weeks following a stint where it defeated backtoback ranked opponents by double digits it got back on its feet with a muchneeded victory over Arkansas on Wednesday PERIOD

Both teams have tough roads ahead of them to the NCAA tournament but have put themselves in great positions early and should see continued success if they maintain their current level of play PERIOD

Biggest Winners

At the time of writing this Alabama and Tennessee appear to be the SECs best chance of securing a national title in  with Auburn trailing them by a marquee win or two PERIOD

Despite possessing the third toughest schedule in the nation according to ESPN Alabama is  and has yet to come close to dropping a conference matchup PERIOD Its projected as a one seed with marquee wins over No PERIOD  Houston on the road Michigan State and North Carolina and has looked unbeatable through its first six games of SEC play PERIOD

Tennessee hasnt looked quite as invincible even losing at home against a struggling Kentucky but it still looks like a title contender and is currently projected as a two seed PERIOD Its defense is the best in the country based on defensive efficiency a big reason why it was able to defeat No PERIOD  Kansas by double digits PERIOD And while its only other marquee wins came against Maryland and USC I expect that to change in the coming weeks PERIOD

Auburn and Texas AM are probably the trickiest teams in the conference to gauge having strong starts to conference play but a combined  record against Quad I teams PERIOD

The Aggies were notably knocked out of the top  amidst a messy stint in nonconference play but their last few wins indicate that they have adjusted as they have yet to drop a conference game PERIOD Their best win came at home against Missouri where they trounced the Tigers by  behind great shooting and rebounding PERIOD

The No PERIOD  LSU gymnastics team has undergone a rough start to their season to say the least PERIOD After Mondays fall in the home opener the Tige

Auburn is  but its lack of Quad I success has the Tigers projected as a six seed despite being ranked No PERIOD  in the AP Top  PERIOD Still theyre in great standing when it comes to making the NCAA Tournament possess one of the best defenses in the countryand have a combined six remaining matchups against the three other top teams in the conference left to improve that projection PERIOD

Bottom of the Barrel

That leaves the bottom half of the conference excluding Arkansas PERIOD

Of the remaining teams Florida and Mississippi State currently have the best tournament outlooks PERIOD Most of the Bulldogs merit wains on their early success as they started the season  before dropping six of their next seven but Florida is a bit more interesting PERIOD

Despite a  record and multiple blowout losses in nonconference play this team remains on the outskirts of Joe Lunardis bubble and hasnt had a bad conference showing yet PERIOD Its three SEC losses have come by a combined deficit of eight points against Auburn and Texas AM with two of those coming on the road PERIOD Its three wins include a doubledigit victory over LSU at home and two strong wins over Georgia and Missouri PERIOD

LSU looked to be in great shape after it opened conference play with a then topten victory over Arkansas and its lone loss at the time coming by two points to risingstar Kansas State PERIOD But since that win its lost its last five games behind poor shooting and shifting starting lineups PERIOD

Vanderbilt has flashed potential throughout SEC play but that hasnt translated to the win column as the team is currently  with a  record against the SEC PERIOD And Ole Miss and South Carolina look to be the worst teams in the conference in that order PERIOD Though the Gamecocks somehow managed a win over Kentucky they lost their remaining conference matchups by an average deficit of  points including a doubledigit loss to the Rebels Ole Miss only SEC win PERIOD

Theres still plenty of time for the state of the conference to extensively change with  conference games remaining on each teams schedule PERIOD Expect an update in the middle of February PERIOD

For Matt McMahon and LSU the starting lineup was always going to be fluid to start the season PERIOD
