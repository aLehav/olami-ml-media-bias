Nebraska added another run later in the inning and held on despite allowing Minnesota to climb back from a  deficit earlier in the game PERIOD

We obviously got in a hole but I was proud of our guys that they kept fighting and kept battling Anderson said Friday PERIOD Its unfortunate the game ended like it did but Ive got no complaints about the effort that went on out here today. nebraska scored four firstinning runs but the Gophers climbed back with four runs in the fifth inning PERIOD They tied the game in the seventh on a Michael Handel double but did not score again PERIOD
