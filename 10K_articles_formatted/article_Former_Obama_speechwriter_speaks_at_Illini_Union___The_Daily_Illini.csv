Most people use 10cent words when a nickel or penny would do Favreau said PERIOD Keep it simple and keep it short. in addition to sharing tips for speechwriting he also shared his personal experiences with working with President Obama on his congressional and presidential campaigns for the past eight years PERIOD

Favreau reflected on the time he first met the president when Obama was an Illinois senator PERIOD Obama said to him I still dont think I need a speech writer but they keep telling me I do and you seem nice enough. whether it was his reaction to a joke or his emotions after a national crisis such as Hurricane Katrina Favreaus stories about Obama gave the audience a unique perspective into the mind of the president as the president himself as called Favreau his mind reader. connor Brown attendee of the lecture and junior in LAS put it this way I enjoyed most the behindthescenes stories he told about the president PERIOD You could tell when he was speaking unscripted and was telling reallife stories he had experienced. as of one of the greatest hallmarks Favreau displayed his command of speechwriting through his own presentation Wednesday night PERIOD He stressed for students to always remember to structure speeches with a beginning middle and end PERIOD As simple as it sounds he assured the crowd that many of the savviest politicians in Washington forget that at their core speeches are stories PERIOD
