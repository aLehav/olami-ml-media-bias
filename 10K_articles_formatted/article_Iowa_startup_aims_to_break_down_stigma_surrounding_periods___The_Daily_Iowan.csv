Rylee Wilson News Reporter October  

When Iowabased wellness coach Alyx CobleFrakes discovered she could plan her business tasks around her menstrual cycle to make completing them easier she figured there had to be a something out there to help her do the planning  but no such item existed PERIOD

Although CobleFrakes had no previous productdevelopment experience she decided to create the planner herself  and so The Agenda PERIOD Period was created PERIOD

The idea came to me  it literally felt like it floated to me she said PERIOD

CobleFrakes said different tasks are easier to accomplish during the different phases of the menstrual cycle and the planner can help women map out what tasks to do and when during the month PERIOD

When we start to go with the hormonal cycle that our body is going through more naturally we feel less resistance more productivity and increased revenue she said PERIOD

The Agenda PERIOD Period started with a beta test created on Google Sheets PERIOD After testing the idea among  women in business a Kickstarter that raised more than  took the agenda from an idea to reality with its first limited run of  copies PERIOD

CobleFrakes who lives on a farm in southeast Iowa is currently developing her product through the University of Iowa ventureschool program PERIOD

For CobleFrakes the planner is not only about helping women plan their business tasks around their cycle but also breaking down the stigma surrounding periods PERIOD

A portion of the proceeds from The Agenda PERIOD Period goes to the Pad Project an organization that provides menstrual products to women in need around the world PERIOD

Its really important that theres a social heartbeat at the heart of this PERIOD Theres a lack of menstrual equity around the world thats a really huge problem CobleFrakes said PERIOD While were working on the empowerment spectrum with The Agenda PERIOD Period we acknowledge that you cant be empowered if you lack basic supplies. after CobleFrakes came up with the idea for The Agenda PERIOD Period she asked cofounder Sunny Sink to help her get the project up and running PERIOD

Sink said the feedback they received from the betatest group was overwhelmingly positive PERIOD

The biggest thing people report is feeling more connected with themselves and their bodies and more productive in their business Sink said PERIOD A lot of women also said it helped them give themselves permission to take time off. cobleFrakes met graphic designer Yasmin MarreroGarcia and the planners beta tester through the  Million Cups Iowa City entrepreneurship group PERIOD MarreroGarcia said she wanted to design The Agenda PERIOD Period to be both approachable and beautiful PERIOD

I hope that this is able to touch every woman that needs it every individual that has a menstrual cycle that needs it in order to help them gain insight gain the knowledge that I was so happy to help gain from being part of the Agenda as well as the power and the effect that Alyx and Sunny have had on me she said PERIOD Im very proud of them and I know this is going to go far. read Next
