5337,2021-05-02,"medical Hypotheses a speculative medical journal has retracted an article that disputed the efficacy of face masks and inaccurately affiliated itself with Stanford University PERIOD

After Stanford requested a correction to remove the misattributed affiliation the journal opted to pull the article altogether PERIOD

Jonathan Davis a spokesperson for Elsevier the publisher of Medical Hypotheses told The Daily that the journals editorial committee determined that aspects of the paper were misleading and that a broader review of existing scientific evidence shows that masks are an effective prevention of COVID19 transmission. davis said in the email that the studys author Baruch Vainshelboim had submitted the article with the Stanford Medicine affiliation which inaccurately describes him as an affiliate of the Cardiology Division of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System and Stanford University PERIOD

Vainshelboim could not be reached for comment PERIOD

The study claims that masks are not effective in preventing the transmission of coronavirus and can cause medical conditions that deprive the body of oxygen  theories that have been repeatedly debunked by health authorities and infectious disease experts PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Dean Winslow a professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist said that the issue of mask wearing has become a culture war in the U.S PERIOD

The fact is that masks do a really great job of preventing transmission of COVID19 and other respiratory pathogens to other individuals Winslow said PERIOD He added that theres good scientific data to show that masks also provide a significant degree of protection to the people wearing them. winslow pointed to the decline in influenza and other respiratory virus transmission this past winter to underscore the efficacy of masks adding that some may choose to adopt mask wearing going forward as a new normal. until coronavirus is contained Winslow recommended that individuals continue to wear masks indoors and in crowded outdoor spaces PERIOD

According to Davis the study misquotes and selectively cites published articles PERIOD In addition a table in the paper outlining the health consequences of mask wearing contains unverified data and speculative statements. the journal apologizes to Medical Hypotheses readers for the difficulties this issue has caused Davis wrote PERIOD

Davis added that following an internal review by the journals editorial leadership and Elsevier Medical Hypotheses has redesigned its review processes to ensure that similar incidents are avoided in the future PERIOD

Although the article was initially published online in November it garnered attention in early April on social media and rightwing sites PERIOD On April  an Ohio Republican candidate for U.S PERIOD Senate tweeted the study and it was later cited by an Ohio state representative at a committee hearing PERIOD

On the same day the Gateway Pundit a conservative outlet that is known to spread disinformation promoted the study in an article titled Stanford Study Results Facemasks are Ineffective to Block Transmission of COVID19 and Actually Can Cause Health Deterioration and Premature Death.The article was later updated to remove the incorrect affiliation PERIOD

Stanford Medicine swiftly distanced itself from the study issuing a statement on April  that clarified that the Medical Hypotheses article is not a Stanford study and that the author inaccurately affiliated himself with Stanford PERIOD The school said that it strongly endorses the use of face masks to control the spread of COVID19 PERIOD

School of Medicine spokesperson Julie Greicius previously told The Daily that the author is not now and never was officially employed with the VA or Stanford and that the terms of his contract limited his use of the Stanford affiliation to the period of his visiting scholar term PERIOD Vainshelboim was a postdoctoral research assistant in a VA Palo Altoaffiliated research lab for a yearlong period ending in September  PERIOD

Winslow said that he and other physicians have been concerned about the spread of medical misinformation throughout the pandemic PERIOD He attributed the rise in misinformation in recent years to the amplification of fringe viewpoints PERIOD

As someone who has cared for more than  COVID19 patients since last year people are getting sick and even dying because of misinformation Winslow said PERIOD

Winslow added that there is both an ethical and moral component of mask wearing I believe in doing things not for yourself but because its the right thing to do for society. wearing masks Winslow said is a symbol of solidarity and compassion for your fellow Americans. medical Hypotheses is not new to controversy PERIOD The journal faced backlash after it published a paper that denied the established link between HIV and AIDS in  PERIOD The article was later withdrawn PERIOD Mehar Manku the journals editor said in  that Medical Hypotheses should publish papers that would not get accepted elsewhere. medical Hypotheses guidelines state that the journal will consider radical speculative and nonmainstream scientific ideas provided they are coherently expressed. cameron Ehsan is a junior at Stanford studying neurobiology PERIOD He served as a news editor and newsroom development director for Vol PERIOD  and was the Vol PERIOD  winter managing editor PERIOD
