The Penn State football teams loss to Iowa this past Saturday might have come at the worst time possible for the Nittany Lions PERIOD

Or it could have come at the best PERIOD

It really all depends on them PERIOD

The  loss to the Hawkeyes gives them positives to build on and failures to learn from PERIOD They found out what can happen to them when they come out flat and they were slapped in the face with the realization that they are not invincible PERIOD

They found out that they cant win just by fooling people PERIOD While their newfangled offense is still a step in the right direction and the Lions shouldnt go back to the old way the element of surprise isnt there anymore PERIOD Plays will only work if they are executed to near perfection because the other teams in the Big Ten know they can expect the option they can expect a lot of passing and they can expect to see backup quarterback Michael Robinson getting the ball PERIOD The Lions found this out early enough to adapt for the rest of the Big Ten schedule PERIOD

They also saw each others fighting spirit in the nineminute 22point comeback that turned a blowout into an overtime thriller PERIOD

But a loss is still a loss and it destroys the wave of momentum and invincibility the Lions had after their first three victories PERIOD The Lions realized that they are not a powerhouse yet and beating Nebraska didnt mean that Big Ten teams still couldnt manhandle them PERIOD

So what kind of team will this be now  one that has learned from its mistakes now recognizing that coming out flat is not an option in the Big Ten Or one that isnt sure what to do now that it has been slapped in the face with the realization that it will not walk over everyone it plays

Whichever way it goes this team will be exposed for whatever it is in the coming weeks PERIOD The loss to Iowa forces the team to find its identity right before the grueling stretch that even before the season was circled as the Lions proving ground PERIOD

Saturday brings a trip to Madison to play No PERIOD  Wisconsin PERIOD It is the Lions first road trip of the season and they will be playing in an environment for which adjectives like hostile are not nearly adequate enough PERIOD They will also be playing a notoriously physical team with an offensive line that is bigger than Iowas with all five starters and three backups tipping the scales at over  pounds PERIOD The starting defensive tackles are also past that mark PERIOD

After that comes a trip to Ann Arbor to play No PERIOD  Michigan then Homecoming against Northwestern before the Lions voyage to Columbus where they havent won since  to play No PERIOD  Ohio State PERIOD

It could get ugly but if the Lions get things together now and dont allow the season to go into a downward spiral everything is still possible PERIOD One loss doesnt eliminate any team in a power conference from national championship competition and losing in September gives the Lions more than enough time to get back into it PERIOD They are also very much alive in the Big Ten race PERIOD No team has gone undefeated in the conference since  when Michigan won out and won a share of the national championship PERIOD

However if they dont shape up immediately their hopes to return to the postseason could be very much in doubt come November PERIOD Illinois and Indiana dont look very imposing now but if the Lions come limping into their last four games those teams could pose threats and Virgnia showed what it could do to the Lions last season PERIOD Michigan State has a ton of talent as well despite its early underachievement PERIOD If the Northwestern game is the only one the Lions win in October they will need at least a  split to get six wins and a postseason bid PERIOD A finish such as that would allow the Lions to spend their Christmas break in Detroit the everpopular vacation destination for the Motor City Bowl PERIOD

This season can still become a return to prominence or a regression to mediocrity PERIOD If they want it to be the former the Lions have to start now PERIOD
