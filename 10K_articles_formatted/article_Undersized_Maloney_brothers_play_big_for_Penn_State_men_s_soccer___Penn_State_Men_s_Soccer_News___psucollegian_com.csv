Midfield Austin Maloney  gets challenged by Niclas Mohr  of JMU during the first half of the game at Jeffrey Field on Friday Sept PERIOD   PERIOD Penn State defeated JMU  PERIOD

Sports are riddled with amazingly gifted groups of brothers or talented teammate duos but rarely does one get to witness two brothers on the same team and even rarer is one blessed with opportunity to witness a dynamic pair PERIOD

The Warriors have the Splash Brothers Curry and Thompson two high scoring sharpshooters who work in conjunction with the others success PERIOD But theres no real genetics the two share unless you count the ice in their veins PERIOD

In  three out of the NHLs four Staal brothers  Jared Eric and Jordan  started on the same line together although theyve since bounced around rejoining on new teams or facing off with each other on new franchises countless times PERIOD

While the Warriors have their dynamic duo and the NHL has their family Penn State has its own version of both  the Maloney brothers a relentless undersized duo composed of two kids from Harrisburg hellbent on getting their way PERIOD

With Connor and Austin listed both well under six feet height clearly is not something that runs in the Maloney family PERIOD However thats made up for with the scrappiness they both share PERIOD Their short height is a clear family trait but perhaps the most obvious feature they possess is the competitive gene PERIOD

Whether its Canjam or Spikeball in the Maloney residence they play with some blood sweat and tears and maybe even an elbow or two PERIOD

Its definitely very competitive at the Maloney household Connor said PERIOD Especially downstairs playing ping pong or FIFA whatever it is paddles are being broken were getting on each other and its great. coming from a competitive household of four kids three of whom play DivisionI soccer and an upbringing that taught both brothers what it means to have to best someone who wants it bad Connor and Austin have made names for themselves at the collegiate level with contentiousness they play with PERIOD

Connors a guy who will never be selfdefeated coach Bob Warming said PERIOD If youre going to stop him hes going to make sure youre the one to do it PERIOD He wont allow himself to give less than what hes got. the twotime AllBig Ten first team forward and the conferences former offensive player of the year is the Nittany Lions main weapon as their very scheme of attack is centered around him and his movement without the ball PERIOD

The Lions system is one that emphasizes a lot of crossing forward runs usually with Connor as the focal point supported by smart midfield play an area in which his younger brother Austin has excelled this season PERIOD

With the elder Connor as team captain and leader in goals itd be understandable if Austin lived somewhat in his shadow trying to match the precedent his older brother sets for the team PERIOD Austin Maloney however is anyone but the kid comfortable just being the stars little brother and plays second fiddle to no one PERIOD He is a player that takes zero plays off and is utterly uncomfortable with waiting falling back and moving on to the next play PERIOD If theres any slack to be picked up for the Lions hes always first in line PERIOD

In the  formation the Lions have run with recently Maloney plays the role of one of two defensive midfielders his skill and hustle warranting him freedom to roam all over the pitch PERIOD

As the Lions bring the ball up from their goal one of their three usual center backs will eventually work a pass in towards Austin who at that point goes fulleffort to work in one of two scenarios PERIOD

In scenario one a larger player on Austins half of the field will intercept a pass in the midfield or poke the ball out from beneath his feet PERIOD This is when the   150pound sophomore turns into something closely resembling the Tasmanian Devil PERIOD As quick as the ball is lost Maloney shifts pace from his front foot to his back transitioning back from his opponents half to aid his defense PERIOD This is where his opponent is taken a bit back by Maloneys hustle and sheer drive to possess the ball PERIOD His aggression and channeled frenzy more often than not win his team back possession or at least disrupt his opponents attack forcing him to adjust the plan PERIOD

Scenario two is one seen played out more to his teams favor PERIOD Its where Maloney couples his technical skill with his determined tenacity PERIOD Hell bring the ball past the halfway line and through his opponents whizzing by players much larger than himself with ease and not without style PERIOD This scenario most notably played out in his teams second game of the season against California where he and Connor connected on a flamboyant flying header for Connors first goal of the season PERIOD

It was one the best goals Ive seen since Ive been at Penn State head coach Bob Warming said PERIOD It was a great counter attack PERIOD Connor jumped over the top of a   guy and just hung up in the air like great athletes do and headed it in PERIOD It was just an incredible incredible goal PERIOD

The presence of mind it took for Austin Maloney to turn around and lob a ball from midfield all the way to his brother who was being swarmed in a flurry of Golden Bear defenders almost seemed telekinetic like the two can communicate without a word PERIOD

Us knowing where each other is going to be definitely helps us Austin said PERIOD I know what Connor wants when he makes his runs  hes hungry for a goal. both Warming and Connor thought he jumped too early although its pretty tough to stop a Maloney once he gets his mind set on something PERIOD In this case even gravity couldnt do the trick PERIOD

The two have something special Warming said PERIOD
