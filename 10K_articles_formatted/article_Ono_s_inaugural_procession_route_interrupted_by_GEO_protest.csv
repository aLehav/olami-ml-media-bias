HR has suggested that graduate workers take an effective pay cut Eno said PERIOD The March  deadline for a tentative contract agreement has passed over the break and HR does not seem to have taken that seriously PERIOD Affording rent housing and medication are serious problems that grad workers need to work with the administration to solve and folks are fed up with a lack of serious engagement from HR at the negotiation table PERIOD Thats why folks are out here. eno said GEO chose to protest on the Diag during the academic procession to maximize the visibility of their cause PERIOD

Grad workers are not able to ignore not being able to pay for rent food medication Eno said PERIOD And that means the folks in the University cant ignore it either. lSA junior Connor Zahler told The Daily he thinks GEO chose an effective time and place to hold their protest and he supports their demands PERIOD
