Softball vs SVSU on Sunday March   PERIOD

Kellen VossApr  

The Grand Valley State softball team continues to dominate this season behind excellent pitching picking up two more wins against Wayne State on Monday April  PERIOD The Lakers held the Warriors to only two runs total in the doubleheader PERIOD

The second game of the doubleheader was won by GVSU pitcher Allison Grys PERIOD She pitched another solid outing giving up only one run two walks and four hits to Wayne State PERIOD

With the win Grys improves to  on the year PERIOD The senior has been throwing a softball around for a long time and cant wait to help this team reach its full potential and lead them to postseason success PERIOD

I tried out all the positions growing up Grys said PERIOD I played infield outfieldbasically Ive played every position except catcher PERIOD But when I played my number one position was always pitcher. grys has always considered herself as someone who lives in the moment and she loves the game of softball today because she basically gets to play it every day PERIOD

Ive always said that the sport I was in was always my favorite sport Grys said PERIOD When it was basketball season I loved basketball and when it was softball season I loved softball. not only does Grys love being on the mound but she excels at the position and has the statistics to prove it PERIOD During her first season at GVSU in  she threw three complete games posting eight wins two saves and a . eRA in her  appearances PERIOD Opposing batters had a rather pitiful . batting average against her PERIOD

Before transferring to GVSU Grys played two years at Lansing Community College where she had similar success on the mound PERIOD During those two years Grys accumulated a remarkable  record  total strikeouts and  total shutouts PERIOD

Majoring in clincal exercise science with a focus in physical therapy Grys felt the need to transfer to GVSU for academic reasons and has loved every minute of her time here PERIOD

We played at GV a few times when I played at LCC and I always liked the school Grys said PERIOD I wanted to transfer to a bigger school for education and GV was close to home PERIOD I love the people and I love everything about Grand Valley. grys love for her school is very evident and she is thankful for all the great coaches who have helped her grow tremendously as a pitcher and a person PERIOD

My time here has been short but I would say from last year that I have improved Grys said PERIOD Ive learned a lot from my coaches here and I learn from the players around me daily. when looking back at her time here at GVSU Grys favorite Allendale memory is winning the conference with her team last year as the Lakers showcased their ability to quickly improve PERIOD

Winning the league was pretty cool Grys said PERIOD How we started out the year last year was kind of rough so showing people that we had improved and made it to regionals was awesome. what makes Grys a pitcher for batters to fear is her multitude of pitches PERIOD She doesnt have just one goto pitch PERIOD Instead with her experience she may even have three PERIOD

Before I came here my drop curve was number one but now Ive worked so hard on my jump curve and I rely on that pitch a lot Grys said PERIOD When it comes to my best pitch I dont think I could pick between my jump curve and my changeup. in her senior season Grys has stepped into a leadership role for the Lakers PERIOD She likes to lead by example as her teammates feed off of her consistent pitching performances PERIOD

As a pitcher everyone feeds off you in a game and I try to be a leader both on the field and in the dugout Grys said PERIOD I like to lead by example PERIOD Im not the biggest talker but when Im in a zone on the field I know people feed off of me even though Im quiet. as the postseason gets closer and closer for this softball team Grys has a lot of faith in her team along with a lot of things she wants to accomplish before she hangs up her cleats as a Laker PERIOD

I want to win conference again I want to make regionals again and hopefully we can make it to the World Series Grys said PERIOD Doing all that would be an awesome way to end my senior year. that path to World Series continues this weekend as the  Lakers look to pick four more road wins in doubleheaders with Davenport and Purdue Northwest PERIOD The games on Friday April  in Grand Rapids are at  p.m PERIOD and  p.m. with the games on Saturday April  in Hammond Indiana taking place at  p.m PERIOD and  p.m PERIOD
