Freshman Dago Saenz and from left to right Colin LaFon and Tim Culbertson holds on the fourthplace trophy after losing to Alabama in the National Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball Association PERIOD The loss came after defeating Edinboro in overtime and falling to rival Whitewater over the weekend PERIOD

By Ryan Wilson  Staff writer March  

Wheelchair basketball player Spencer Heslops father paced from left to right PERIOD

Arms crossed PERIOD

Hands in his pockets PERIOD

Back to arms crossed PERIOD
Hislops mother  also wearing a No PERIOD  jersey  was on the other side of bleachers PERIOD
As Heslops dad looked antsy in the purple stands at the University of WisconsinWhitewater wearing one of his sons old jerseys Spencer and the Illinois mens basketball team were in an alloutbrawl with the University of Alabama for third place at the National Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball tournament PERIOD
Illinois was leading  with  left in the game PERIOD It was the teams first lead of the game after Heslop and Ryan Neiswender hit a combined threestraight 3pointers for the team to help Illinois rally back from a  deficit in the first half PERIOD

Early in the game Alabama was capitalizing on their height  particularly Michael Auprince  by collecting the offensive rebounds and hitting shots over Illinois heads PERIOD
But in Illinois rally attempt the Illini applied the fullcourt press PERIOD They forced Alabama turnovers PERIOD They were hitting their shots  in defense or not  and finding their own rebounds PERIOD Neiswender also came alive by orchestrating Illinois offense and dishing passes to Spencer for an open layup or midrange jumper PERIOD
Illinois kept its momentum for three minutes after taking the lead PERIOD But then Neiswender perhaps a little too confident at the time launched a 3pointer from the left wing early in the shot clock PERIOD
The Illini scored only three points over the course of the next three minutes PERIOD Alabama scored  as Auprince and the teams bigs were collecting rebounds hitting shots over Illinois defenders and burning the shot clock PERIOD
Soon after Alabama burned Illinois chances at third place PERIOD The Crimson Tide won  PERIOD
After the game head coach Matt Buchi said the team spent its last huddle reflecting on the season and the seniors careers PERIOD
It honestly in the long run doesnt matter who wins the national championship Buchi said PERIOD Its all about the things you learn in the process while doing it. prior to the thirdplace game Illinois defeated No PERIOD  seed Edinboro University  in overtime in a game that was overshadowed by Buchis unknown absence PERIOD
A day later with Buchi rejoining the team on the sidelines the University of WisconsinWhitewater who hosted the tournament handed Illinois a  loss to send the Illini to the thirdplace game PERIOD
As Alabama and its fans chanted after the last game Illinois players hugged their family and friends PERIOD Spencers dad was no longer pacing PERIOD
Theyre successful to me Buchi said PERIOD But well know when theyre really successful in the next   years when they start families make good career and they give back to their community PERIOD
