As a senior about to graduate I would like to respond to Rachel Baers letter to the editor about Oxy not being a happy college PERIOD It seems to me that the only reasons for this so called lack of happiness are a lack of good parties and some of the dorms feel sterile.First in response to the comment that you heard from upperclassmen that there used to be multiple partiesthats rosy retrospection. pERIOD and even when there were multiple parties the fun of it was moving from one to the other in flash mobs as they broke apart PERIOD Oxys parties have always been a joke in that sense PERIOD Let me promise you as an upperclassmen by at least junior year there will be plenty of other things to do besides going to an offcampus house party a dorm party or a dance.Second I wanted to alert you and any other students with woes about the party scene you currently live in one of the most vibrant cities in the country PERIOD Third and most importantly I am surprised and appalled that the requirements and indicators for happiness cited in your complaint are partying and fancy dorms PERIOD Certainly the Oxy community can find happiness outside of a campus party.As a senior currently immersed in comps in one of the most stressful times of my life I am very happy and very grateful for the happiness that Occidental has provided me PERIOD Thanks to Oxy I have gotten to spend a semester in India followed by a backpacking trip through the Himalayas no parties there but I assure you I was happy a summer conducting research in Istanbul then a semester in New York working at the United Nations again no college parties but I assure you NYC somehow managed to be very fun PERIOD Over the summer I will be traveling to Rwanda with Oxy I dont think there will be any college parties there and Im not sure if there will be air conditioning and cardkey entry but Im pretty sure I will be very happy PERIOD Finally my time spent on the Oxy campus has been an opportunity to make the best friends I could have ever asked for and engagement with professors who have also become my friends have expanded my mind and supported my academic growth throughout my  years of college.I understand that freshman year classes can be dull and that the struggle to make a social life is frustrating and the size of Oxy can make that hard PERIOD But I want to assure you as a senior to a freshman that your discontent does not lie in the lack of parties PERIOD As you become an upperclassmen you will be in classes that are more engaging and learning can actually become fun not work that needs to be relieved by a night of partying  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD friendships will grow so you wont want to go to the dances anyway  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD and life will expand far beyond the beer pong table PERIOD
