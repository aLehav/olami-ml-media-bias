In July  Virginia Tech President Charles Steger joined  other college presidents and chancellors across the country when he signed the Amethyst Initiative an association promoting reconsideration of the legal drinking age in America with hopes of lowering it from  to  PERIOD

When I initially heard about this group my reaction was that of a typical college student  excitement PERIOD Since then however Ive realized that even if Congress took the idea of lowering the drinking age seriously the logic behind this movement is terribly flawed PERIOD And downright dangerous PERIOD

According to the Amethyst Initiatives Web site it doesnt necessarily support a specific policy change PERIOD Instead it says the organization calls upon 

Sounds legitimate enough PERIOD Making good decisions about alcohol use isnt something anyone is going to argue against PERIOD But then its Web site goes on to stress that an epidemic of dangerous bingedrinking runs rampant on college campuses and  college presidents believe thats reason enough to rethink the drinking age PERIOD

The whole idea makes me think of getting a drivers license PERIOD If we compare the two situations it makes no sense to grant someone a license if they havent passed the learners permit test PERIOD I certainly dont want to be on the road with people who cant identify what a red octagon means PERIOD So why should young people be rewarded with a lower drinking age when we havent proved ourselves responsible enough to drink at age  We shouldnt be granted the privilege of drinking simply because weve demonstrated we cant handle it when its illegal PERIOD Furthermore Im not impressed by  college presidents agreeing on anything PERIOD Considering the random assortment of schools listed with signatories ranging from the giant University of Maryland at College Park to the almost unheard of Kapiolani Community College its obvious that the head of almost every higher learning institution in America was approached and asked to sign PERIOD

According to data provided by the Digest of Educational Statistics in  that would include  fouryear colleges and universities and  twoyear schools PERIOD If anywhere near that number of people were asked to sign  is not an impressive number by any means PERIOD In fact a statistic that should speak volumes is the number of presidents who chose not to sign PERIOD

People also seem to overlook the fact that college campuses arent the only place in America where we find  to  year olds PERIOD Most people are still in high school when they turn  PERIOD Not only does that diminish the significance of  college presidents opinions it shows that legislation allowing 18yearolds to drink would simply reassign the problem to high school principals and parents of young teenagers PERIOD As widespread as alcohol already is in high school if 18yearolds were allowed to drink theres no doubt it would increase PERIOD That consequence is especially alarming when we consider that those who start drinking before they turn  are four times more likely to become dependent on alcohol than people who wait until they turn  PERIOD

Many people who support the Amethyst Initiative point out that if 18yearolds are capable of voting serving on juries entering into contracts and serving in the military they should be able to order a drink PERIOD While thats a valid point none of those activities can hinder brain development as excessive alcohol use can PERIOD And rewarding immature behavior with more freedom doesnt seem like the solution we need  especially when other peoples health and safety are put at risk PERIOD

Supporters of the initiative also point to countries around the world and their lower numbers of alcoholrelated deaths as a reason to lower the drinking age here PERIOD The truth is you can find data supporting both sides of that argument PERIOD And in comparison to American teens a greater percentage of teenagers in most European countries report binge drinking in the past month PERIOD

Its also worth mentioning that with the current drinking age at  college students are wary to seek medical attention for alcoholrelated injuries and ailments because theyre afraid of getting in trouble PERIOD If anything needs reconsidering its the communication between hospitals law enforcement and college officials and the punishments that stem from trying to save a life PERIOD

I know this opinion isnt common among college students but Im not entirely against lowering the drinking age PERIOD I just dont think the logic behind this initiative is one we should use to change any law PERIOD We dont legalize immoral acts on the grounds that theyll happen either way PERIOD And while lowering the drinking age means the number of illegal acts will decrease it doesnt mean the number of reckless ones will PERIOD
