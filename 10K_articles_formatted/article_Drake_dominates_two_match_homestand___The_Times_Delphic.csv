8064,2012-02-05,"the No PERIOD  Drake mens tennis team improved its record to  on the season with two  victories this past Saturday over Western Illinois and Chicago State PERIOD

Head coach Evan Austin played a number of different players in the two matches a sign of the teams great depth PERIOD

I was trying to get some different guys into some matches and look at a few different doubles teams he said PERIOD We have a bunch of guys who can contribute in the lineup so when we play two matches in one day our depth helps us. the Bulldogs started out the morning with a bang against the Western Illinois Leathernecks sweeping all three doubles matches PERIOD

Freshman Alen Salibasic teamed up with senior Cesar Bracho and they took on Patrick Hammers and Mandela Shepard at the top doubles spot PERIOD The Drake duo was victorious  PERIOD Sophomore Robin Goodman and freshman Ben Mullis defeated Ben Yue and Jim Capalbo  at the second spot. senior Sean OGrady and junior Jean Erasmus made quick work of their opponents at the third position as an  score completed the sweep PERIOD

Drake continued its dominant play in singles led by Salibasic at the top singles spot PERIOD The Drake freshman posted a   victory for his first win at the top singles spot PERIOD Erasmus no stranger to the No PERIOD  spot won easily   PERIOD

Goodmans match was the most up and down of the afternoon PERIOD After winning the first set  against Western Illinois Ben Yue he was forced into a second set tiebreaker to finish off the match    PERIOD

The rest of the Bulldogs dominated their matches as senior Jonathan Hadash won   at the fourth spot PERIOD Mullis and freshman Grant Tesmer both posted   victories at the fifth and sixth positions respectively PERIOD

The next match of the day was against Chicago State which was at an immediate disadvantage having only five players available PERIOD Therefore the Cougars had to forfeit a doubles match and a singles match putting Drake at a  advantage to start the match PERIOD The Bulldogs soon stretched the lead to  as Salibasic and Bracho as well as Goodman and Erasmus made quick work of Chicago States doubles pairings PERIOD

With only two matches to go until their second victory of the day each Drake player looked to be on a virtual sprint towards the finish line PERIOD Erasmus playing at the first singles spot won   PERIOD Salibasic won   PERIOD Mullis making his first appearance at third singles took advantage of the opportunity with a   win PERIOD Hadash posted an equally dominant   victory PERIOD Tesmer garnered yet another   win being the only Bulldog to finish the day without dropping a single game PERIOD

It was important to get a couple of dual matches on our home courts Austin said PERIOD Hopefully we can take a little momentum and confidence into the big match on Thursday. the quick sweep on Saturday afternoon gave the Bulldogs some much needed confidence for arguably their toughest home match of the season on Thursday against No PERIOD  East Tennessee State PERIOD

They are a very competitive team and their coach does a good job of getting his guys ready to play Austin said PERIOD The thing for us is to have a good week of practice and coming out from the get go and being aggressive. the Bulldogs match against East Tennessee State will start at  a.m PERIOD at the Roger Knapp Tennis Center on Thursday PERIOD
