For premajor Audra Proctor joining a sorority made sense PERIOD The firstyear student hoped to find her network of friends and expand her social calendar PERIOD

I feel like it was giving me an opportunity to meet a whole bunch of close friends and a whole bunch of new girls I wouldnt normally have met Proctor said PERIOD I really like going to social events and helping plan that stuff and getting dressed up. according to TCU Panhellenic more than  other firstyear women had the same idea as Proctor PERIOD This year  women registered for recruitment and  actually started the process PERIOD

Panhellenic advisor Jordan McCarter said that of the women who started the process  were firstyear students PERIOD

We thought the number would grow a little but not by as much as it did McCarter said PERIOD

According to TCUs Fraternity and Sorority Life website  percent of the undergraduate population is affiliated with a fraternity or a sorority PERIOD McCarter said this years firstyear class has about  women making the female class of  about  percent Greek PERIOD

Last year  women started the process PERIOD Despite the jump in enrollment figures McCarter said the process went smoothly PERIOD

Recruitment is the same process regardless of if there are  people or  people McCarter said PERIOD We added more Rho Gammas current sorority members who help guide potential new members through the process so it was fantastic to have more help throughout the week. kappa Alpha Theta president Hayley Lyddon said the recruitment process has become more casual over the years PERIOD

On bid day we used to dress up Lyddon said PERIOD Now each chapter wears tshirts PERIOD Its less pressure on the girls. lyddon also said schedule changes helped manage the recruitment process PERIOD Women must follow structured schedules and attend parties during the day where they visit each sorority house PERIOD In order to deal with the larger amount of women coming through the houses during recruitment week Lyddon said sororities held more optional rounds PERIOD

You can have optional parties to have some girls come back later Lyddon said PERIOD It helps to have fewer girls in the house at a time. lyddon said the Kappa Alpha Theta house was looking forward to having so many new women interested in sororities PERIOD

It was really exciting to see a lot of girls get involved Lyddon said PERIOD It was exciting for our chapter as well. excitement spread to a new Theta too PERIOD Proctor accepted her bid to Kappa Alpha Theta and said she looked forward to being a member of a TCU sorority PERIOD

A lot of times sororities get a bad rap but at TCU I think that theyre a really fun opportunity Proctor said PERIOD
