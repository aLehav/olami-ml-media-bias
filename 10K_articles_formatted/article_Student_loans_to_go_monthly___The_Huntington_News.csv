As the economy continues to hamper families abilities to pay for education Sallie Mae recently unfolded the new Smart Option Student Loan PERIOD
 On March  the college lending company announced that the new loan is aimed at saving students money in the long run as well as reducing the overall time spent paying back the loan PERIOD
 Patricia Christel a representative for Sallie Mae explained that instead of having interest deferred until six months after graduation students would make monthly interest payments while in school PERIOD This would allow the student to pay off the loan in five to  years instead of  to  she said PERIOD
 In May  Sallie Mae teamed with Gallup and conducted a poll to see how students and parents pay for higher education PERIOD The study showed that the average loan amount borrowed by students was  allowing for monthly payments of around  under this plan PERIOD The student would save  percent more than if they began payments after graduation according to the study PERIOD
 According to Sallie Maes Savings Example the average borrower would save close to  percent in finance charges  percent more than if they deferred all payment and would repay the loan nine years sooner PERIOD
 This new loan will enable students to save money build good credit and repay their student loan debt faster Christel said PERIOD Students avoid negative amortization and graduate with substantially less debt. of the  college students interviewed for the study  percent primarily relied on student loans to cover tuition PERIOD
 Salvatore Freni a middler international affairs major said he has always used student loans to pay for school PERIOD
 I think thatd be great he said referring to the new loan PERIOD Id take advantage of it. hinal Patel a junior nursing major echoed his statements PERIOD
 It would be good he said PERIOD You wouldnt have to worry about paying after college PERIOD It wouldnt be as much. as further incentive those who make automatic monthly payments may be eligible for interest rate deductions Christel said PERIOD
 Sunish Oturkar a senior electrical and computer engineering major said he thinks  a month is a price that most students could feasibly pay PERIOD
 Most kids make well over that with their part time jobs and the incentive of paying less overall and getting rid of debt years earlier would encourage them to put that money aside he said PERIOD
 Sasha Watson a senior speech language and audiology major who borrows from Sallie Mae did not think the average loan amount was realistic but agreed with the new approach PERIOD
 Its a good way to pay the interest because it just builds up PERIOD Interest is like another loan itself she said PERIOD
 Watson has relied on loans throughout her college career PERIOD While expressing excitement for the new loan she raised other issues with student loans in general PERIOD
 I dont think there should be interest accruing until after you graduate she said PERIOD To pay loans and interest is a lot especially today. christel said that Sallie Mae urges the  approach essentially tapping all avenues of free aid before borrowing PERIOD However thats not always as reliable she said PERIOD
 Scholarships should be easier to get and federal aid is so hard to get Watson said PERIOD
 The Smart Option loan will be available for the    school year and will be awarded based on students current Sallie Mae private loan balance grade level and credit standing PERIOD The approval process will also involve a review of monthly income and other payments PERIOD
