I came to this realization one day as I walked to class PERIOD I began to notice the variety of clothing they wore PERIOD I saw business suits pajamas military uniforms grunge and some weirdo with a Kenny Loggins Tshirt  okay so that was me  PERIOD As I saw this I thought about how the vast majority of us will one day be married have kids and trudge daily to work so that junior can come to college and marvel at the mysteries of life PERIOD When we grow up and go to work everyone around us will change PERIOD



Granted it is a natural human tendency to feel the need to belong to some group PERIOD Thats a given we all belong to different groups in one way or another PERIOD What concerns me is when we begin letting that group influence how we perceive things which happens everyday PERIOD People stop thinking for themselves and allow the groups principles or ideas to think for them PERIOD



This is how diversity is lost PERIOD The consequences of this behavior can be good or bad and vary from group to group PERIOD Religions were started this way but then again so was racism PERIOD



At OSU weve got cowboys athletes greeks antigreeks organizations clubs dorms apartment groups and so many more PERIOD With all those groups its impossible not to be in at least one PERIOD So as you are with your group every once in a while just stop and ask yourself if what you are doing saying or whatever is really you PERIOD If we all do this then our precious diversity will always be preserved PERIOD



Im not intentionally trying to make you all think Im crazy PERIOD I dont listen to Kenny Loggins too terribly much and Im not even trying to change the world PERIOD Im just trying to give you all something about as you eat your fruity pebbles in the morning PERIOD
