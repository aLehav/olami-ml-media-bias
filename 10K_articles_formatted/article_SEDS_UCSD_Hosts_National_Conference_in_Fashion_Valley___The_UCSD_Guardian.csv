A lot of other groups in SEDS focus overall on expanding awareness teaching people about space stuff like that doing their own stuff for appreciation Shnell said PERIOD We dont do that as much PERIOD We just focus more on the engineering side of things. shnell stressed that this did not mean that other chapters werent as competitive in their field PERIOD

Lockheed Martin and companies like that still need marketing teams or recruitment people so those people are still valuable Shnell said but we feel that engineering is more our focus so we strive toward that. tabling at the conference were startups Rocket Lab and Additive Rocket Corporation a company founded by former SEDS UCSD members PERIOD

People who come to our tables are not so much looking to get a job but are more looking for guidance PERIOD Were like the cool uncle you know People kind of come out of their shell Director of Product Development for ARC Alec Kochis said Where bigger companies are like the Budweisers at these events were more like the craft breweries focused on making the perfect product PERIOD Were really passionate about the craft. this weekends SpaceVision is the twelfth annual conference with last years being hosted at the University of Central Florida PERIOD Arizona State University has been selected to host the next conference in  PERIOD
