2830,2010-03-23,"this year the Detroit Tigers continued their tradition of making big offseason moves in hopes of returning to the World Series PERIOD An influx of speed and a rejuvenated staff will help them at least contend with the Twins and the Sox in the AL Central PERIOD

Offense

The Tigers made two moves this offseason in an attempt to bring some muchneeded speed into their lineup PERIOD Their first move was trading Curtis Granderson to the Yankees in exchange for Austin Jackson among others PERIOD

While Granderson was arguably the Tigers best base stealer the team is envisioning Jackson as their center fielder of the future PERIOD Jackson has never played in a major league game but was the Yankees most prized offensive prospect for years PERIOD He has speed and developing power the Tigers are hoping he will develop sooner rather than later PERIOD

After a long free agency Johnny Damon signed a oneyear deal with the Tigers PERIOD Even though his defense has slipped in recent years Damon had arguably the best season of his career in  offensively hitting  home runs driving in  RBIs and batting . with  steals PERIOD

Damon will play left field and will likely DH as well and his oneyear contract means that once again he will be in a contract year and will be looking to get paid PERIOD Damon brings a veteran winning presence to a team in dire need of just that PERIOD

The batter who will benefit the most from Jackson and Damons arrival will be Miguel Cabrera PERIOD The run support should help him improve upon his already strong  RBIs PERIOD Cabrera is one of the best and one of the most underrated players in the game and now being  years old his home run total already at  should increase as well PERIOD

Assuming he stays in shape which is never a sure thing with Cabrera he should be able to maintain his . average PERIOD If the Tigers make some noise in the Al Central Miguel Cabrera will likely be included in MVP discussions PERIOD

Magglio Ordonez and Carlos Guillen the two most seasoned veterans on the Tigers will start in right field and in the designated hitters spot PERIOD

Ordonez is out to prove that he is not too old to be a dominant hitter looking to build on the nine home runs he hit last season PERIOD Ordonez has always hit for the average . last season and a career average of . so there is no reason to think that his average will drop any time soon PERIOD

Guillen on the other hand should be worried that his job might be in jeopardy this season PERIOD While he was injured last year in two seasons he has seen his home run average drop from  to  his RBI total drop from  to  all while his average took a . point hit PERIOD As the teams designated hitter he will need to find his form if he is not going to be replaced PERIOD

Scott Sizemore at second base will be the second rookie starter on the Tigers adding even more speed to the back end of the lineup PERIOD Super utilityman Brandon Inge will start at third after having one of the best seasons of his career Adam Everett will start at short and Gerald Laird will start the year behind home plate PERIOD

Pitching

Justin Verlander coming off of a 19win leagueleading 269strike out season will take the mound as the Tigers opening day starter PERIOD After a down year in  Verlander worked on his mechanics and returned to being one of the games most dominant pitchers PERIOD The Tigers will need him to have another stellar year if they are to contend PERIOD

Rick Porcello who at  years old won  games last season will start behind Verlander PERIOD If he can continue to develop and not hit the sophomore slump like so many young starters do the tigers will be able to start thinking about the postseason PERIOD

Jeremy Bonderman who has only made  starts in the last two years just one last season is looking to regain his spot in the rotation PERIOD Max Scherzer who won nine games for Arizona last season will move into the fourth spot and as of now Eddie Bonine who started four games last season will take over the fifth spot PERIOD

Jose Valverde who came over from the Astros via free agency will bring his  saves to Detroit taking over closing duties PERIOD Hard Throwing Joel Zumaya will likely set him up PERIOD

Prediction

Detroit has the talent to content with the Twins and White Sox at the top of the AL Central PERIOD The Tigers greatest flaw is a thin rotation though which could kill their playoff hopes if one of the starters gets injured PERIOD

Damon and Jackson seem like nice fits and should spark the offense while giving Cabrera more run support PERIOD This team filled with veterans will need to stay healthy as an injury to anyone will seriously hurt their chances PERIOD

If the offense can stay healthy and Bonderman can regain his form then the Tigers could challenge for the division PERIOD But no team ever has a season without a number of setbacks so I do not see them beating out the Twins PERIOD

But it wouldnt be surprising if the Tigers overtake the White Sox and finish second PERIOD
