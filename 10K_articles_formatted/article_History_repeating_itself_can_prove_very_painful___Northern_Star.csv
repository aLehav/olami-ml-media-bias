Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Eric GubelmanFebruary  

The day after high school graduation I was riding my bike near the park in my town when I happened to see my mother in her car PERIOD It wasnt just happenstanceshe was looking for me PERIOD

Get up to the doctors office she said PERIOD Your father is having a heart attack. lifes dramatic moments never seem real when they happen PERIOD At the time I felt like I was in a movie and when I remember it today in my minds eye I watch what happened as an observer rather than a participant PERIOD

I see a teenager with longish hair wearing gym shorts and mustard yellow Converse tennis shoes bending over his 10speed and cranking the bike for all it was worth PERIOD I hear the heavy breathing as the teenager sprinted the bike the two miles to Dr PERIOD John Hippensteels office in Robinson Ill PERIOD

I see the 18yearold watching his 46yearold father being loaded into his car for the trip to the hospital and I see the fathers face white but not ashen in discomfort but not in excruciating pain PERIOD

When I think of the days following the attack I remember scenes from the mental movie PERIOD Theres the son sitting in the hospital lobby waiting for the five minutes of every hour that he can visit his father PERIOD Theres the son talking to the local newspaper to update the health status of the towns mayor which was what my father was PERIOD Theres the father being discharged from the hospital PERIOD

This 12yearold video has been sitting on my minds shelf gathering dust but last week I had occasion to play it again PERIOD My father called and said he was undergoing heart surgery for a triple bypass PERIOD One artery was  percent blocked and another was  percent blocked PERIOD

One more Florida retiree is going under the knife this week PERIOD Surgeons will harvest yet another set of leg veins another chest will be cracked another heart will be held in a doctors hands PERIOD

My first reaction was perhaps an uncommon one PERIOD I was angry with him PERIOD In  he got what a lot of heart attack victims never geta second chance PERIOD He took advantage of that chance by getting his weight down exercising and watching his diet PERIOD He even stopped smoking PERIOD

In  he was scared PERIOD Later he was scared too PERIOD He feared he wouldnt reach his fiftieth birthday PERIOD Staying fit was truly a matter of life and death PERIOD His heredity he could not controlhis father had died of a heart attack before his fiftieth birthday PERIOD

My fathers fiftieth birthday came and went as well as his fifty-first through fifty-eighth PERIOD Somewhere in those mid50s his attitude changed PERIOD The warning grew faint the altered lifestyle too confining PERIOD He started smoking and he ate like he had always eatenpraise the fat and pass the mayonnaise PERIOD

It does not speak well of me to have these emotions PERIOD Im a bit ashamed that my first reaction was not concern for his health but rather a selfrighteous anger about the frailty of humans in general and parents in particular PERIOD

How could anyone ignore the warning More importantly how could my father show human weakness Confronting the mortality of ones parents as well as their imperfections in one week is a bit much PERIOD

Ive stopped wallowing in my emotions about this but I wanted to set them down in black and white before they became merely a distant memory PERIOD

I wont send this column on to Florida PERIOD I wont talk to him of missed opportunities nor will I reproach him for eating that extra Twinkie or skipping his aerobic program PERIOD He can do that for himself PERIOD

When I talk to my father it will be about my concern for his recovery and my love PERIOD I might also tell him of my fears of what it would be like if he died PERIOD Ill probably tell him I love him PERIOD

Sometimes you should just leave the past behind and concentrate on the futurea future that allows for the failings that define our humanity PERIOD

Its a future that allows not only for my fathers failings but mine PERIOD
