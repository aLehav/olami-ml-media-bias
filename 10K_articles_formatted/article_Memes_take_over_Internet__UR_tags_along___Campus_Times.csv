Weve all heard hundreds of times about how were living in the information age and how social media has become the dominant form of communication. inundated as we are with these notions of an increasingly digital social landscape its rare that were surprised by a sensation spreading rapidly through the depths of the internet PERIOD

Yet even against this information age backdrop the sheer speed with which the collegespecific meme craze has exploded in popularity across the nation is well remarkable PERIOD Over the course of a couple weeks it has grown at such an exponential rate that today you will be hardpressed to find a college or university without an insert institution name here memes Facebook page PERIOD

At this point its probably worth backtracking a bit to define exactly what is meant by collegespecific meme. according to Urban Dictionary  the obvious authority on such matters  the top definition of an Internet meme is a short phrase picture or combination of the two that gets repeated in message boards and chat rooms for far far longer than anything ever ought to be. the collegespecific memes then are comprised of the pictures from wellknown preexisting memes with new phrases overlaid on them relating to the university in question or its surrounding area PERIOD Whether theyre repeated far longer than anything ought to be though is in the eyes of the beholder PERIOD

On Thursday Feb PERIOD  UR joined the movement with the creation of its very own UR Memes page by junior Cindy Zu PERIOD In the week since then the page has been liked by nearly  Facebook users and well over  UR memes have been posted on the page PERIOD Within days of its formation the Rochester Institute of Technology created a similar page dedicated to RIT memes PERIOD

It just shows the power of social media Zu remarked PERIOD I dont think there are many things that could be circulated this fast. according to Zu UR Memes came out of humble beginnings PERIOD When she started the group she invited only  friends to be a part of it and created the first five memes herself to get the ball rolling PERIOD As she hoped would be the case however the group began ballooning in size and popularity within hours PERIOD The unstoppable meme train had been set in motion PERIOD

While Zu characterized the page as lighthearted and humorous she also noted that she feels UR Memes could grow into something more impactful perhaps even becoming a vehicle for University improvement PERIOD

The main thing thats really come out of it is that its a means for the student body not just to vent but also to get what they want to say out there  about the school the administration or something they like or dont like she explained PERIOD

Junior Alex Murray expressed a similar sentiment PERIOD There seems to be a lot of stuff on UR Memes aimed at Danforth and food service for example he said PERIOD I just went to a Dining Services meeting and I feel very satisfied with what theyre doing but if UR Dining looked at UR Memes somehow then I could definitely see it changing campus in some way. while Zu and Murray hope the page might have a positive influence on University policy UR Memes has not been without its fair share of controversy PERIOD Zu mentioned that she received personal complaints regarding one meme that targeted and slandered a particular fraternity PERIOD To date this is the only meme that Zu has removed from the page PERIOD

Zu compared what she doesnt want UR Memes to become to what College ACB was before it was shut down last year  an arena for students to bash and in some albeit much rarer cases to compliment individuals or specific groups and organizations PERIOD

That being said Zu emphasized that she wants to keep censorship on the page to a minimum PERIOD

UR kids are smart they know where the line is and when not to cross it she said PERIOD I posted something a couple days ago saying if you do decide to  post something flagrantly racist or sexist  people are going to let you know. so itll moderate itself if anything. beyond any controversies however a proportion of the student body also feels that UR memes are  to put it simply  just not funny PERIOD Junior Zach Bailey is among this group he posted a meme on the page that read theres a point where this needs to stop and weve clearly passed it. its like beating a dead horse thats what this is Bailey said PERIOD Nobodys going to get it except for people at the University and even then how many people are going to laugh at it

Zu though has a succinct piece of advice for those who arent fans of the growing meme momentum Unlike the page. thats the beauty of it all  if you have a problem with it you dont have to see the memes she went on PERIOD But I think people are enjoying them more often than not. fleming is a member of the class of  PERIOD","Memes take over Internet, UR tags along - Campus Times",University of Rochester
