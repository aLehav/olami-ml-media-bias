Gov PERIOD Josh Shapiro signed legislation on Thursday to unlock state funding for hospitals emergency medical services and nursing homes marking the first progress since August in clearing Pennsylvanias budget impasse PERIOD

However the Republicancontrolled Senate and Democraticcontrolled House must still agree on the largest outstanding part of the . billion budget and several budget priorities for both sides PERIOD

The final passage and signing of House Bill  happened on the last day that both chambers of the General Assembly were in session until November PERIOD

The bill makes . million in new revenue available for EMS providers through increased reimbursements reauthorizes a tax on hospital services to aid health systems and sets Medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing homes PERIOD

House Republicans praised their colleagues in the upper chamber for a bipartisan and narrowly focused approach to resolving the budget issues PERIOD

I think it was very smart and astute of their caucus and their leadership to start shrinking the discussions including the important things that we need to get done state Rep PERIOD Seth Grove RYork said in a meeting with reporters Wednesday PERIOD

A spokesperson for House Majority Leader Matt Bradford DMontgomery said Democrats had earlier asked Senate Republicans to take that approach focusing on bipartisan noncontroversial issues first but had been unsuccessful since the House passed the spending plan back in July PERIOD

While those conversations have not been as successful as we may have hoped we appreciate them setting aside our differences and moving these vitally important noncontroversial and bipartisan policies forward spokesperson Beth Rementer said adding that the health care funding streams are all a great example of things we can rally behind. money for most state agencies and programs became available in August after the Senate returned from summer recess for a day to take the final step to send the general appropriations bill which the House passed in July to the governors desk PERIOD

At the time the code bills had not been finalized and Budget Secretary Uri Monson said he would not release funding for certain programs estimated to be about . billion without the code bills PERIOD

Earlier this month the House passed three code bills that would release some of that money PERIOD Those bills are now awaiting consideration in the Senate but leaders in each chamber have been tightlipped about how far apart they are PERIOD

A spokesperson for Majority Leader Joe Pittman has said only that discussions are ongoing regarding the omnibus fiscal code bill and school code bill PERIOD Spokesperson Kate Flessner also said the Senate is considering the House tax code which he called intriguing earlier this month PERIOD

We look forward to continued dialogue with our colleagues in the Senate as we await their response regarding the legislation House Appropriations Chairperson Jordan Harris said PERIOD

The process is also still overshadowed by the fallout over a deal between Shaprio and Senate Republicans to create a school voucher program to help lowincome families in poorly performing school districts pay private school tuition with taxpayer dollars PERIOD

House Democrats said they would not agree to a voucher program and Shapiro followed through with a promise to lineitem veto the  million program when he signed the budget to avoid an extended impasse PERIOD

The school code would provide  million in Level Up funding for the states  poorest school districts . million for community college funding increase the amount available for educational tax credits by  million to  million and establish a school environmental repair program PERIOD

It would also establish an educator pipeline support program to provide stipends for student teachers make a number of changes to the administration of statewide school safety programs and provide  million for school mental health grants PERIOD

The tax code bill would accelerate a phased reduction in the corporate net income tax rate started in Gov PERIOD Tom Wolfs last budget to reach its final level of . five years earlier in  PERIOD It would also increase the share of operating losses companies can use to offset income taxes from  to  over the next four years PERIOD And it would implement new reporting requirements to make it more difficult for large companies to shift profits out of state to reduce their corporate income tax liability PERIOD

Although the corporate tax reform measures have bipartisan support GOP leaders criticized Democrats who control the state House for amending the bill in a committee meeting hours before its final consideration to include a special interests smorgasbord that Republicans said would doom it to fail in the state Senate PERIOD

Among the provisions with which GOP lawmakers found fault are a corporate net income tax reduction for medical marijuana producers and a  million boost in the states film production tax credit PERIOD

The omnibus fiscal code bill would reauthorize the whole home repair program that started in the previous budget using pandemicera federal aid and increase the authorized complement of state police troopers to  PERIOD

It would also provide  million for adult mental health programs  million for increased medical assistance dental reimbursements  million for school repairs . million for the firstever state contribution to the cost of public defenders and  million to bolster Philadelphias bid to attract the FIFA World Cup in  PERIOD
