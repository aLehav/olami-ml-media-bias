Mike Gilloon  Tuesday October  

After recordsetting performances from Irish quarterback Brady Quinn and receiver Maurice Stovall in Saturdays  win over Brigham Young the only impediment that could slow such offensive momentum would seem to be an incredible defensive effort PERIOD Or just the schedule PERIOD

The Irish enter their second bye week of the season after the victory over the Cougars and will have to wait until a Nov PERIOD  home game against Tennessee to play again PERIOD

Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis has no qualms with an extra week to prepare for the Volunteers PERIOD

He and his staff expect to have scouting reports on Tennessee done by Sunday in order to spend all of next week gameplanning PERIOD They will balance their work on the Volunteers this week with recruiting duties as seven assistants will leave Wednesday night for two full days recruiting hoping to add to their list of  verbal commitments PERIOD

Wednesday night before we hit the road well have the Tennessee scouting report done minus the South Carolina game that theyre playing this week Weis said PERIOD Ill give them off on Saturday so they can spend some time with their families but when we come back in on Sunday I dont want to be spending time working on the scouting report PERIOD I want to be worried about game planning. the Irish also had a bye week before almost upsetting USC on Oct PERIOD  and Weis hopes to use the time to create a successful scheme for Tennessee PERIOD But several Irish players have voiced disappointment over having to wait two weeks to take the field again PERIOD

I want to keep playing Irish strong safety Tom Zbikowski said after a BYU game in which he returned an interception  yards for a touchdown PERIOD But rest up get an extra week of game planning is nice. an extra week of planning couldnt hurt the Irish PERIOD Though Tennessee lost  to undefeated Alabama Saturday the Volunteers are only surrendering  points per game and have given up just one touchdown pass through six games PERIOD

They are extremely talented all across the board offensively and defensively with different athletes and the capabilities they have Quinn said PERIOD

But after the offensive display the Irish put on Saturday it wasnt time yet to focus on a game two weeks in the future PERIOD

Were just enjoying this win now Irish tight end Anthony Fasano said PERIOD Well look at them next week. notes

u Weis will focus on recruiting Thursday and Friday of this week and might even hit the road looking at prospects PERIOD When asked at his Monday press conference whether he would be going to talk to high school coaches or look at specific recruits Weis indicated he wasnt traveling for pleasure PERIOD

If Im going Im going for a purpose he said PERIOD Im not going to schmooze. u Irish running back Justin Hoskins did not play against BYU for undisclosed reasons PERIOD However Weis indicated he is close to returning to action PERIOD

Hes going to come back he said PERIOD Hes been working out with strength coach Ruben Mendoza and were going to get back and see where we are right now here today PERIOD So we just had this little powwow on Friday on this very subject and Ill find out the answer to that where we are after I meet with him today. share This Story
