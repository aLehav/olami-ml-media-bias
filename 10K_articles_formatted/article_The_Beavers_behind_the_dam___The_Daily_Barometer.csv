Walking around Oregon State University there is a good chance of hearing Go Beavs. what seems to have become a common phrase in Corvallis has become second nature to OSU students faculty and staff PERIOD Why is this saying now a familiar trademark with the school and athletics programs attached to OSU Its all in the marketing PERIOD
A team of promoting advertising ideation and financial directors share the responsibility of marketing and promoting athletics at the university PERIOD With fundraising help from OSUs Foundation staff the advertising and development of the Athletics Department led the way in advocating a strong message to the outside world about what Beaver Nation has to offer athletically PERIOD
Steve Fenk associate athletic director said the main responsibility of the marketing team is to drive attendance and the fan experience at games and events PERIOD
The Marketing teams goal is to increase the awareness of our intercollegiate sports programs to that which drives attendance and interest and ultimately generates revenue for the program Fenk said in an email PERIOD
Steve Clark vice president of university relations and marketing said the athletics department has an operating budget annually of . million PERIOD The Athletics budget is managed internally by Athletics Department staff but is part of the universitys overall budget and financial management PERIOD
Ticket revenues from football basketball baseball volleyball gymnastics and wrestling provided . million in the  seasons PERIOD Revenues that support the athletics department budget come from a variety of sources including funds from the Pac12 Conference and NCAA ticket revenues advertising sponsorship revenues and annual donations from fundraising. intercollegiate Athletics adds significant value to the overall student experience as well as the culture and success of Oregon State University Clark said via email PERIOD For example Athletics contributes to the universitys engagement with students alumni donors and the broader community. fenk said every studentathlete gives OSU permission to use images of them for promotional posters social media and schedule cards by signing forms PERIOD The Marketing Communications and Ideation teams in conjunction with the specific sports program staff select the studentathletes used in promotional work PERIOD
Intercollegiate Athletics by nature is a very diverse entity across the country Fenk said in an email PERIOD Typically studentathletes are selected as good standing members of their respective teams academically andsocially as well as athletic ability. janessa Thropay a sophomore forward on the womens basketball team said it is logical that the more successful a sport is the more promotion and attention is given in form of advertisements and promotionals PERIOD However she can see why other sports could feel left out or dont receive the same amount of support and encouragement PERIOD
I feel that OSU does a pretty good job as far as diversity and representing its studentathletes fairly in regards to race and gender Thropay said in an email PERIOD I feel that womens basketball is represented a fair amount and we are happy with the recognition we have received for our accomplishments and overall success PERIOD In general I feel that female sports do need to be promoted and recognized on a bigger scale. traditional advertising as well as posters and social media posts are all a part of promotional work done by the staff with OSU Athletics Clark said PERIOD Branding principles within OSU Athletics allow for elements of advertising to be consistent over time while content of advertising or a given promotion can be specific to a given sport or a specific Athletics Department message or promotional campaign PERIOD
We create sportspecific content and marketing plans for each of our sports that are communicated distributed through different platforms Clark said via email PERIOD We are doing a ticketing trial program for softball this season PERIOD We sold tickets at a swim meet last season against Stanford PERIOD We will continue to explore the expansion of ticketing for additional sports in the future where we believe it can add value. the amount of university funding allocated for Athletics is between . million and  million but varies from year to year Clark said PERIOD
While the university does provide some support to Athletics the university receives tuition and fee revenue for the more than  studentathletes who would otherwise not attend OSU and as a result this revenue would likely not be received by the university PERIOD
Football is the Athletics leader in terms of ticket sales and advertising revenue PERIOD Due to widespread popularity and media exposure football creates the most interest of any program Fenk said PERIOD Football season brings alumni fans and visitors together to embrace the opportunities OSU has to offer PERIOD On a financial note football nearly generated a gross  million last fiscal year supporting all of the other Athletics programs in some way. you may have heard the term the engine that drives the bus Fenk said in an email PERIOD Thats what football isthe engine PERIOD Football is Athletics greatest revenue maker almost universally in Football Bowl Subdivision programs and particularly at the Power  Conference level. additionally Fenk said that ticketing prices for mens and womens basketball are based on market analysis PERIOD Factors that determine the ticket prices include popularity demand venue and success PERIOD
Our womens basketball and baseball programs are tremendously successful and demand for tickets has never been as high at OSU Fenk said via email PERIOD Our mens basketball program also remains very strong in terms of interest and has among the richest traditions of any program in the country. thropay said taking the time for promotional pictures of film segments for the womens basketball team can be difficult to fit into an already packed daily schedule PERIOD She sets aside time to do so simply because it is one of the demands of being a studentathlete at this level PERIOD
When I am used for advertising for OSU I feel as though it is a part of my job as an OSU athlete Thropay said via email PERIOD When accepting to come to Oregon State for womens basketball I was aware of these types of responsibilities being asked of me and I am happy to oblige to any requests or marketing that come my way. athletics is an important economic contributor Clark said PERIOD Visitors to Corvallis for athletic events contribute an estimated  million annually which in turn means a large positive impact on the local economy. intercollegiate Athletics adds significant value to the overall student experience as well as the culture and success of Oregon State University Clark said PERIOD For example Athletics contributes to the universitys engagement with students alumni donors and the broader community. athletics Department aims to increase awareness of programs PERIOD
