The twoday search for Tiffany Smith ended in tragedy on Sunday January third when the missing Northfield resident was found deceased on the west side of Parish House at  p.m PERIOD The students who found her body promptly telephoned  the responders subsequently removed her body PERIOD

Smith had been reportedly distraught when she was last seen on the January  and a search was organized involving the Northfield police campus security and members of the general public PERIOD Campus security were given a rough description of her and asked to look out for a blond middleaged Caucasian female PERIOD

At the time of the search campus security was informed that Smith was possibly intending to jump into the Cannon River PERIOD The Director of Security Wayne Eisenhuth and two other officers helped in the search PERIOD They patrolled Carleton property along the river a task made difficult by the rivers length adjoining Carleton property PERIOD Her disappearance was wellpublicized and a search was conducted involving the police friends relatives and volunteers PERIOD

An autopsy has been commissioned into the death of Smith but no foul play is suspected PERIOD According to Eisenhuth the condition of the body indicates that she may have been outside Parish House for more than a day PERIOD Yet they believe she did not enter any campus building as she did not possess a OneCard or key PERIOD

Both the Northfield Police and Campus security have confirmed that there were no signs of a struggle or of foul play with exposure being the likely cause of death PERIOD

The location of the deceased on the campus west side was such that she could not be seen from the car park on the north side of Parish house PERIOD Therefore it is probable that Smith could have arrived at Parish on the second but avoided discovery by Northfield Community members and Carleton students until the third PERIOD Outside of a few vantage points it would have been difficult for passersby or searchers to find her PERIOD

However Eisenhuth stated that this is mainly speculation as there were no sightings of Smith nor did she give any indication that she would be on Carletons campus PERIOD Furthermore he knew of no sightings of the  yearold made since  a.m PERIOD on New Years Day PERIOD

Dean Livingston responded to the situation with a campus wide email on Tuesday January fifth PERIOD She expressed the colleges sympathy towards the deceaseds family on behalf of the college PERIOD Her email also informed students that there are counseling and chapel facilities open to those upset by the incident PERIOD

Both Dean Livingston and campus security admit the school does not face any legal recourse on account of the incident and is participating in the investigation PERIOD However as Smith was not a member of the Carleton community it is primarily the Northfield Police department and the Hennepin Country medical examiner who are investigating her death PERIOD To supplement the autopsy there will be a toxicology report in the coming days PERIOD
