SAM TAYLOR Evergreen managing editorOctober  

Following WSU volleyballs  set win over Arizona Jen Greeny was showered in hugs PERIOD Hugs from coaches hugs from players and hugs and handshakes from loyal fans of the Cougar volleyball program she built on the Palouse PERIOD

A product of the Palouse herself Greeny won her two hundredth career game as WSU volleyballs head coach on Friday PERIOD She joins Cindy Fredrick her coach from her playing days at Wazzuas only the second WSU volleyball head coach to achieve  wins PERIOD Frederick set quite the legacy with  wins to her name providing something for Greeny to strive for PERIOD

Thats what were here to do PERIOD To be better than the people before us and to set records and to be the best PERIOD I mean my coach had some really great players Greeny said PERIOD To be in that elite company thats pretty impressive. fridays win was nothing close to guaranteed as the Cougs struggled to get past their own mistakes PERIOD

Both WSU and Arizona had teamhitting percentages below . for much of the game before a dynamic fifth set padded their numbers PERIOD WSU hit . to Arizonas . pERIOD

If were not playing ranked teams sometimes people are thinking that we should crush a team Greeny said PERIOD Arizona is such a great team and defensively especially and passing it was just a tough night trying to really get anything going. pia Timmer and Magda Jehlarova the teams usual offensive leaders struggled before eventually coming through in key moments PERIOD

Timmer hit . and produced nearly as many errors  as she did kills  PERIOD

Jehlarova started slow but found her footing delivering eight blocks on the night four of which were within the final two sets PERIOD

Karly Basham led the Cougsdefensive efforts with a seasonbest  digs PERIOD

Despite the teams offensive woes Laura Jansen showed up and showed out for WSU as she put on a show for the fans in Bohler Gym which included her parents who had traveled to Pullman from the Netherlands PERIOD

She hit . and created a seasonbest  kills PERIOD Jansen was active throughout the game disrupting Arizona and creating opportunities for her teammates PERIOD

After a dreadful third set in which the Cougs were three points away from a set victory only to let a rally fall the Wildcats way to fall behind  the Cougs could have easily conceded the match in the next set PERIOD

Instead the message in the huddle and from Greeny was to flush it and focus on the next set PERIOD

We just all stand and take a deep breath and then we just talk to each other play our own game have some fun dont get so stressed and tense Jansen said PERIOD

In the fifth set the Cougs did exactly that to find themselves in a  tie PERIOD When it mattered most setter Argentina Ung took a ball she might usually pass to a more potent offensive player and instead smacked it directly to the feet of the Wildcats for the fifteenth point PERIOD

Next none other than Jansen the Cougs spark for the night snagged the final kill to secure the Cougar win PERIOD

Greenys ability to reign in her team during a subpar performance and channel the energy to win speaks to how exactly she achieved  wins as head coach at WSU PERIOD

Shes a great coach PERIOD She just helps us so well and she pushes us to be the best Jansen said PERIOD

Friday was only the Cougs sixth home match of the season PERIOD WSU playing more home matches down the stretch provides opportunities for meaningful improvement without the distractions of travel PERIOD

Weve been on the road so much that its hard to really get training and practice in and individual work Greeny said PERIOD Now that were home for a couple of weeks were really trying to get back to the basics and fundamentals and getting people out of their comfort zone. sam is the managing editor for summer and fall  PERIOD He is a senior multimedia journalism major from Lacey WA PERIOD He plays the trumpet in the Cougar Marching..
