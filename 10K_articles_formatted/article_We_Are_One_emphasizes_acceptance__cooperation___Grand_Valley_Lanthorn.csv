Alyssa RettelleFeb  

Groups of students gathered around stickynote filled tables on Feb PERIOD  to listen to Douglas Kindschi director of the Kaufman Interfaith Institute and professor of mathematics and philosophy speak at the opening ceremony for the We Are One interactive event PERIOD

We Are One is an event that seeks to engage Grand Valley State University students faculty and staff in the pressing global conversation on societal hatred and bigotry according to the event flyer PERIOD

Students were encouraged to write on the sticky notes as a way to convey thoughts experiences and pose questions related to the effects of hatred within society and what actions can be taken to change it PERIOD After discussing their notes they posted them on various walls of the library PERIOD

Kindschi discussed how who we are as people comes from our parents and how we inherit things individually from them but we cannot survive individually PERIOD Individuals can only survive in a group PERIOD

Some species abandon their offspring immediately with no problem but primates and humans have to live in groups Kindschi said PERIOD Historically groups have been families and tribes PERIOD Us belonging to a tribe enables us to live and to survive and for thousands and thousands of years it was important to know what was in our tribe PERIOD Someone who isnt in our tribe must not be human like I am. another topic involved religion and how it has enabled people and tribes to move beyond a specific geographic area PERIOD

Religions grew and spread and gave us an identity with groups that werent in our own geographical area Kindschi said PERIOD So religion is really important PERIOD Its what makes me human PERIOD Those religious people believe its their purpose in life and its tempting to think someone with a different culture race or religion is not human but how are we going to live in that kind of environment

Kindschi closed the discussion by suggesting the agenda for being one and how it can be accomplished PERIOD

The first step is tolerance and its a very minimal first step Kindschi said PERIOD It means if someone does something that I dont like I might be very offended PERIOD But tolerance means that I wont respond with violence PERIOD All it says is that I wont do physical harm to someone who is different than me or that I disagree with. the second step is hospitality PERIOD

Its simply being nice and random acts of kindness Kindschi said PERIOD Being nice to someone you dont know or dont like PERIOD You dont have to be friends with someone to be nice. the final step is acceptance PERIOD

Accepting that the other person who may be different is also a child of God or in more neutral terms someone who deserves the respect and acceptance as a fellow human being Kindschi said PERIOD

If were going to be one we can go beyond that to understanding he said PERIOD We engage in conversations we learn about them and we still may not like them but we have a desire to understand them PERIOD

We can also go one more step to respect PERIOD Respect comes with a more firm relationship where you really want to understand them. emailprotected
