The Lions football team took care of business at Houston Baptist University winning their fourth straight game  PERIOD The victory puts the Lions in third place in the Southland Conference and gives the team an above . winning percentage with an overall record of  PERIOD

Head Coach Ron Roberts was impressed with the win and the dominance of the Lions offense against Houston Baptist who has the secondbest defense in the Southland Conference PERIOD

Conference road wins are huge said Roberts PERIOD But obviously I think that getting a  win is pretty dominating against Houston Baptist who plays a lot of people tough and has a stingy defense. the Lions offense dominated primarily through their rushing game getting  yards on the ground and  passing yards to make  total yards on offense PERIOD Freshman running back Marcus Cooper led the Lions with  rushing yards and scored one touchdown PERIOD This is the third straight game that Cooper has achieved over  yards rushing PERIOD

Junior running back Julius Maracalin ran in two touchdowns and both senior running back Eugene Bethea and freshman running back Delmonte Hall each scored a rushing touchdown PERIOD

I thought we executed very well said Roberts PERIOD We started off running the ball and rushed for over  yards and that is always key PERIOD It opened up some big plays in the passing game PERIOD We wanted to go out there and run the football very well and we did. both sophomore quarterback Lorenzo Nunez and freshman quarterback Byron Walker had time under center PERIOD Walker threw the only passing touchdown of the game to sophomore wide receiver Zeke Jenkins which was his second touchdown pass of the season PERIOD

The Lions scored the most points in a single game this season and Nunez believes that high scoring and big numbers on offense are always the key to success for the Lions PERIOD

I dont think we need to necessarily score this many points every time said Nunez PERIOD We just need to continue to execute the way we have been these past few games PERIOD We did pretty good PERIOD Hopefully we continue to produce like this the rest of the season. the defense scored two touchdowns for the Lions PERIOD Senior defensive back Ryan Sigers returned a fumble  yards for a touchdown and senior defensive back Mayori Ellison caught his third interception of the season and returned it  yards for a touchdown PERIOD

Senior linebacker Sione Teuhema had five tackles and two sacks while senior defensive back Max Lyons led the Lions with  tackles PERIOD

I think our defense was pretty consistent said Roberts PERIOD We had two defensive touchdowns and I think this was the third or fourth week in a row that we held somebody to less than a hundred yards rushing PERIOD It was a dominating performance but still not our best. roberts and the team are focused on their next opponent and not worrying too much about the future on where they will finish in the Southland Conference PERIOD

We take them one at a time said Roberts PERIOD We have another big game on the road again PERIOD Right now we are just focusing on Abilene Christian PERIOD Hopefully we get another conference victory on the road that would be big for us. the Lions will face Abilene Christian University away on Oct PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD
