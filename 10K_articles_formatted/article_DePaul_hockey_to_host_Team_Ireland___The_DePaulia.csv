Known collectively as The Boys in Green Ireland will visit the city of Chicago for a showcase of their own to play in but Randall wanted to see if their national team was willing to compete against the Blue Demons for a friendly match PERIOD

I was talking to some guys that I know in the Irish community and they had mentioned that the Irish national team and their U18 team was coming to Chicago to do a showcase he said PERIOD I just kind of threw DePauls name out there that wed be happy to play them  if thats the kind of competition theyre looking for  they were extremely receptive to that idea and it kind of snowballed into actually becoming a reality. the Irish national team isnt a new phenomenon PERIOD In fact theyve been around longer than you think PERIOD

Joining the ranks of the International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF in  the team made their international debut in  PERIOD The team stepped on the ice for their first game on March   at the Division III World Championships in Reykjavik Iceland where they lost  against Mexico PERIOD However their last tournament appearance was in  as theyve been unable to meet the minimum standard of operating an indoor rink in their home country since PERIOD

According to their website the team has not officially played since November   PERIOD Their last game was against Principality of Andorra during the Development Cup in Fussen Germany where they finished second in the tournament overall and beat Andorra  PERIOD

This will be the first time theyve come to the states and played a U.S PERIOD college team Randall said PERIOD

For the Blue Demons this will be a onceinalifetime opportunity to play an international team that may never occur in their lives again PERIOD And for the Irish a matchup like this may not happen again for a while for The Boys in Green PERIOD

Im trying to do everything I can to get as much recognition within the school as possible and I really saw this as an opportunity to help showcase the caliper of the team that we have at DePaul and how we can compete at a higher level he said PERIOD

Puck drop for the two teams will be at  p.m PERIOD on Friday March  at FifthThirds Arena home of the Chicago Blackhawks practice facility PERIOD Attendance is free and open to all DePaul students and fans alike PERIOD

Its gonna be an exciting game on both sides PERIOD Im excited for it and any opportunity I get to get behind the bench with those guys is an honor. dePauls hockey team finished their season with a  overall record and  in the Northern Collegiate Hockey League conference PERIOD Their lateseason efforts punched them a ticket to the NCHL playoffs but were defeated by the Concordia Falcons in the first round of the playoffs PERIOD
