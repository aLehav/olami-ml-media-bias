After junior shortstop Jessica Merchant hit her third homerun of
the day in the second game of the softball teams home
opener the question running rampant in the bleachers was
What did she eat today

Well I ate a turkey sandwich with pickles
Merchant said PERIOD But really I was just confident going up to
the plate PERIOD I knew I could hit the balls well and I took advantage
of it PERIOD Ive never been a power hitter but Ill take
it. yesterday after  games played away from Ann Arbor Michigan
finally made its homecoming at Alumni Field in a doubleheader
against the Falcons PERIOD The Wolverines swept the series with a score
of  in the first game and  in the second PERIOD Merchant led the
team with three home runs including a grand slam in the first
game PERIOD She upped her season homerun total to  while driving in
nine of Michigans total  runs PERIOD

Obviously she was on coach Carol Hutchins said PERIOD
She can be hot and cold some days but shes certainly
capable of doing well for us when thats what we need her to
do. the Wolverines took an early lead in the first game by scoring
seven runs in the bottom of the second inning PERIOD Leading  with two
outs and the bases loaded Merchant hit a grand slam to bring the
score to  PERIOD

Michigan split the two games between pitchers sophomore Jennie
Ritter and freshman Lorilyn Wilson PERIOD Ritter pitched the first game
allowing just one hit in her five innings PERIOD Wilson on the other
hand had more trouble PERIOD She allowed nine hits and five runs which
was not typical of her previous efforts PERIOD Just last week she struck
out a careerbest  and allowed just one hit and a walk for her
third completegame shutout of the season PERIOD

I thought Ritter pitched well in the first game
Hutchins said PERIOD But I thought Wilson probably had her worst
performance of the year. michigan had lost two straight openers and three of the last
four PERIOD

It was really great to get a win in for our season
opener Hutchins said PERIOD We havent done that for
a few years mainly because weve had to play conference
games PERIOD Thats primarily why we scheduled a non conference
game this year. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
