In July  pop singer and former Disney star Demi Lovato overdosed on heroin laced with fentanyl PERIOD

Two years later Lovato is ready to tell her story with the release of her album Dancing With The DevilThe Art of Starting Over. the 19track album which was released on April  is a mixing bowl of genres that tosses listeners through Lovatos addiction eating disorder struggles and her overdose recovery PERIOD

The track that summarizes her battle best is Anyone. through poignant lyrics Lovato shares that she is unhappy and struggling with circumstances in her life which leads to her relapse PERIOD

She sings I tried to talk to my pianoI tried to talk to my guitarTalked to my imaginationConfided into alcoholI tried and tried and tried some moreTold secrets til my voice was soreTired of empty conversationCause no one hears me anymore. listeners can gather that Lovato is battling with herself and feels like alcohol is a relief PERIOD However Lovato is still a pop star and Dancing With The Devil manages to pack a few bops between the introspection PERIOD

One of the most upbeat songs of the album is The Art Of Starting Over. the fastpaced drums and happiness in Lovatos voice show shes really trying to portray someone whos ready and excited to get their life together PERIOD

However Lovato isnt tackling this journey alone PERIOD She brought some company to collaborate with Ariana Grande Noah Cyrus Sam Fischer and Saweetie all grace the features of this album PERIOD

Met Him Last Night and What Other People Say are tracks that stand out because they seem to be the exact opposites of each other PERIOD In Met Him Last Night Grandes vocals float softly and subtly in the background telling a seductive story of meeting a man who seems to be reliable but is truly not PERIOD It incorporates darker instrumentation by using a huge robotic synthesizer swells with hiphop beats in the background PERIOD

What Other People Say has more of an upbeat tone PERIOD Fischers vocals are more present and distinguishable from Lovatos PERIOD The acoustic guitar strums in the background turn this ballad into something more heartfelt than the grimier synthridden Met Him Last Night. lovato released a YouTube documentary called Demi Lovato Dancing with the Devil and she even called the album the nonofficial soundtrack to the documentary PERIOD While the album as a whole summarizes the story of Lovatos overdose overcoming obstacles and reinventing herself the YouTube documentary adds a lot of personal context PERIOD

For example the documentary explains that Melon Cake is about Lovatos struggles and trauma with her eating disorder PERIOD The song Butterfly is about her late father but without the context of the documentary people could assume its just about an ex because the lyrics are so generic PERIOD ICU Madisons Lullabye has a double meaning about how she was temporarily blind and couldnt see her sister when she first woke up in the hospital PERIOD These explanations make the songs much stronger and more meaningful PERIOD

The album is some of Lovatos best work PERIOD Some of the songs may not be as exciting as others yet the album tells a story of someone willing to get back up and work on themselves PERIOD Lovato is honest with her fans saying Im not perfect with the album PERIOD Hopefully listeners can turn to the album whenever they feel like the world is against them or when they feel hopeless and want to be inspired again PERIOD
