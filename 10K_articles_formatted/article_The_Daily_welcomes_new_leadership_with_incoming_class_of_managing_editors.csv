One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom





A newly elected editorinchief and class of managing editors will take charge of The Michigan Daily next semester PERIOD The new editors will lead their sections and the newspaper for the  calendar year PERIOD



Staffwide elections determined the incoming editorinchief and editorial page editors while the papers management desk selected the new managing editor and the new editor of The Dailys weekly magazine The Statement PERIOD Staff members in each section elected their respective section editors PERIOD



Incoming EditorinChief Maya Goldman an LSA junior previously worked as a senior news editor PERIOD She emphasized upholding The Dailys legacy of impactful reporting PERIOD



Im most excited to continue the amazing legacy of The Michigan Daily and to continue holding the University and all other institutions in this area accountable Goldman said PERIOD Im also really excited to get to know the other people that work here more PERIOD Its a really special talented group of incoming editors and Im really excited to spend this year with them. incoming managing editor Finn Storer a Public Policy junior said he was excited to work with Goldman PERIOD



Were thinking about building The Dailys brand more on campus and reinvesting ourselves in the community Storer said PERIOD



Incoming comanaging news editors Grace Kay an LSA junior and Elizabeth Lawrence an LSA sophomore said they intend to promote more investigative content PERIOD



I dont think theres any big things were going to change Kay said PERIOD Were just looking to keep the forward momentum of managing news editors Sophie and Riyah keep the pressure on the University by pursuing more longform investigative stories. like Grace said we hope to continue our investigative coverage Lawrence added PERIOD We want to keep our daily coverage strong make sure that were serving underrepresented communities being sure to stay on top of coverage and also just making sure that our news community is cohesive and friendly and having fun in addition to publishing a newspaper. the Statement which focuses on longform pieces is published weekly PERIOD LSA junior Andrea Perez the new managing Statement editor said she wanted to give writers more room to work with and shape their ideas PERIOD



My plan for Statement is to be as creative as possible and to allow people more time and space to develop to bring to their ideas with longform journalism Perez said PERIOD



Comanaging photo editors Alexis Rankin an LSA junior and Alec Cohen an LSA sophomore also said they plan to encourage their staff to explore more creative outlets PERIOD



I think for photo something that we want to expand is our multimedia page which is newly renovated I guess is the word  reintroduced Cohen said PERIOD We want to expand the content on there to feature more of our photographers work especially with news events more creative arts content. rankin said they hoped to get  followers onThe Dailys Instagram PERIOD



Were really going to encourage our photographers to branch out from our typical news coverage and sports coverage to push their creativity and get more involved in the community and kind of give us that content that will be more interactive with our readers to brand the photo section more Rankin said PERIOD As well as continue with what weve been doing which is producing highquality photos to enhance our articles. comanaging sports editors Max Marcovitch an LSA junior and Ethan Sears an LSA sophomore said they had plans for their section albeit a bit different from theprevious editors agenda PERIOD



So last year in this interview the incoming sports editors said that they were going to have big plans and then they reiterated it and said they were going to have big plans so were going to pull a  here and say were going to have pragmatic plans  pragmatic smaller tangible plans Marcovitch said PERIOD We do have one big plan that Ethan can explain. sears picked up and explained the sections newest big plan  launching a podcast PERIOD



Were starting a podcast for the sports section Sears said PERIOD Its going to be roughly weekly and were really excited to sort of expand to that platform PERIOD Its calledHighway to Hail.Were going to get as many people on the podcast as we can find ways to get creative with it but were thinking once a week  minutes. incoming comanaging podcast editors Catherine Nouhan an LSA junior and John Fabian an LSA junior as well as Engineering sophomore Noah Tappan who will oversee the video section expressed a desire to work more closely with other sections of The Daily PERIOD



I think podcasts goals will really be restructuring and organizing some logistical positions within the section and really creating  some strong leadership roles Nouhan said PERIOD Were going to work with recruitment and gain some more members as well and I think another goal for us is working in collaboration with other sections and even within the section with our episode called Arts Interrupted and we just want to you know share the literal voices of many different people on campus and really try and collaborate with other sections as well. tappan said he hopes his section could provide more content to complement written reporting PERIOD



Im excited for video to collaborate with more sections like news and provide supplementary content to highlight other peoples articles and also just for video to make more videos Tappan said PERIOD We want more staff and we want more production so that we can grow our channel and hopefully get over  subscribers. comanaging editors of Michigan in Color Carly Ryan a Public Policy junior and Nakia Channey an LSA junior both said they were excited to expand coverage PERIOD

Some  big plans that we have is that we really want to revamp the capacity that we portray the narratives of students of color on campus Channey said PERIOD So a lot of student of color coverage really focuses on narrative content PERIOD We want to make sure that were also being inclusive to creative content as well PERIOD We realize that POC people of color narratives come in many shapes and forms and its not just narratives  its also going to appear in videos and on podcasts and photos and other forms of multimedia expression. ryan and Channey agreed they were excited to see the experiences of students of color portrayed across a broader spectrum PERIOD



Just to say that in different words that are probably worse people of color are not a monolith and people of color know how to talk about so many other things than their own identity so we wanted a platform for that Ryan said PERIOD



Cosocial media editor Madalasa Chaudhari an LSA sophomore will manage her section with Information junior Carrington Tubman PERIOD Chaudhari said she wants to grow social medias role in analytics at The Daily PERIOD

One of the things Im most excited for the upcoming year is really working on building social media analytics presence in The Daily integrating us into this whole community atmosphere and so I just kind of wanted to increase engagement in that sense she said PERIOD



Comanaging web editors Casey Tin an Information junior and Hassaan Ali Wattoo an Engineering sophomore said a strong recruitment cycle has left the section in a good position to innovate PERIOD



We know were going spend our time  me and Casey  improving the website the app and stuff so that people inside The Daily are happy with it and people outside The Daily are happy with them Wattoo said PERIOD I think thats our main goal and then were trying to get as much power and authority to the people coming in so they can do what they want because honestly theyre a lot smarter than we are. tin said she wanted to establish a system to divvy up tasks among staff members PERIOD



I think the main thing that were pushing for is delegating work so there is someone held accountable for each project that we work on and being able to document all the stuff that we do so future classes will be able to pick up where we left off because this is the first year without Bob Lesser so that will be exciting Tin said PERIOD



Art  Design senior Roseanne Chao will comanage design with Business sophomore Jack Silberman PERIOD She said she wants to encourage more designers to come into The Daily to work PERIOD



Like with you guys people come in every day because you guys have to right But designers can technically work remotely Chao said adding that she wanted people to get more exposed to the newsroom. comanaging arts editor Arya Naidu an LSA junior said she looked forward to working with her coeditors LSA senior Jack Brandon and LSA junior Verity Sturm PERIOD



I think this next year were just hoping to make more special editions and up our interview content and just get people excited about writing for arts Naidu said PERIOD



Several members of the new class of editors said they would seek to foster a sense of community within their sections and with readers in general PERIOD Copy chiefs Miriam Francisco an LSA junior and Madeline Turner an LSA senior discussed creating a more inviting environment PERIOD



One of our goals is to make copy more friendly and social with each other since like just the way the section works where people will work one or two nights a week doesnt really foster community because you often only know the people working on your shift and you could go years without ever even meeting people who happen to not work the same day as you Francisco said PERIOD I think were going to have and try to make sure that copy hangs out with each other maybe outside of The Daily. turner noted they will also make an effort to pare down the stylebook as well as make it more consistent PERIOD



One of our first goals professionally is making sure that the style guide is more condensed and simplified or not necessarily simplified but streamlined because we have a lot of redundant things like a lack of consistency so making it easier for our editors Turner said PERIOD



Coeditorial page editors Joel Danilewitz an LSA sophomore and Maggie Mihaylova an LSA sophomore discussed maintaining a sense of cohesiveness in their section as well PERIOD



We want to help realize our responsibilities not only as student journalists but humans in this like trying time in this country and planet Mihaylova said PERIOD We experienced just a really strong sense of community I would say this past semester so we want to provide that also and not only in terms of friendship but we also want to promote that through our writing and what we do and again reiterating responsibilities as student journalists. danilewitz emphasized featuring a more expansive array of opinions PERIOD



We want a section that represents the diverse views of our campus and is also  not only is it diverse its also cohesive like it all comes together really well Danilewitz said PERIOD
