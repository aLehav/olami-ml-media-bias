Sophomore shortstop Sis Bates lays down a bunt PERIOD Bates leads the Huskies with a . batting average PERIOD

One of the benefits of starting a season on a 28game winning streak and winning  of your first  games is that you can afford a bit of a slide PERIOD

The Washington softball team started off as the hottest squad in America but two straight sweeps have dramatically cooled the Huskies   Pac12 off significantly PERIOD The UW slid down to No PERIOD  in the latest USA TodayNFCA Coaches poll from No PERIOD  last week PERIOD Washington has one series left this week at Oregon State before drawing a bye week the last weekend of the regular season PERIOD

Two weeks ago Washingtons path through the postseason ran solidly through Seattle PERIOD Now its not such a sure thing PERIOD

To host a regional the UW has to finish the regular season as one of the top  teams in the country PERIOD That should be pretty certain PERIOD But to host a Super Regional after that assuming the Dawgs advance Washington needs to stay in the top eight which could take some work PERIOD

Luckily for Washington its task is simple win and its in PERIOD Sweeping the Beavers should be enough to at least hold steady in the rankings PERIOD Losing even one game though could keep the Dawgs falling PERIOD The only reason the Huskies havent dropped further is due to the fact that their six losses have come against the No PERIOD  and No PERIOD  teams in the country PERIOD Losing to an unranked OSU team that is on a sixgame skid of its own would have a much worse effect PERIOD

Also influencing the UWs future is the success of the other teams at the top of the polls PERIOD UCLA still has two conference series left including three games against No PERIOD  Arizona State PERIOD No PERIOD  Oklahoma still has Bedlam against Oklahoma State which has been floating in and out of the top25 all season PERIOD Two other top10 teams have to play ranked opponents in the upcoming weeks and each of the four SEC teams in the top  will have to deal with the battle royale that is the SEC Tournament PERIOD

So to review If Washington sweeps Oregon State the Huskies should be able to stay at home until possibly going to Oklahoma City for the Womens College World Series PERIOD If the Dawgs win two of three in Corvallis they could do with a bit of help to maintain a topeight spot PERIOD Winning just one game would require a few major upsets either in front of or directly behind them PERIOD Getting swept for the third straight week this time to an unranked team would probably crush any hopes the UW had of hosting a Super Regional and given the right or wrong circumstances could even call a Regional on Montlake into doubt as well as killing any shred of momentum the Dawgs may have PERIOD

The mentality up and down the UW roster throughout this year has been one of complete focus on the next pitch and Washington wont be looking any further forward than the first inning of play Friday PERIOD The series against the Beavers starts at  p.m PERIOD Friday continues Saturday at  p.m. and wraps up Sunday at noon PERIOD
