9345,2016-10-18,"for the second time in California history voters will be facing an initiative that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana and hemp for adults over  PERIOD As opposed to a similar measure Proposition  which lost in  this one appears to have a good chance of passing PERIOD

According to the latest Field PollInstitute of Governmental Studies at University of California Berkeley survey six out of  likely voters say they will vote yes on Proposition  to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes PERIOD

Proposition  would create two ways to tax marijuana PERIOD One calls for a  percent tax on the retail price of cannabis while the other would be a cultivation tax of . per ounce of flowers and . per ounce for leaves PERIOD The purpose of these taxes is to help cover the costs of administering and enforcing Proposition  PERIOD Local government agencies have the ability to assess additional taxes PERIOD

Proponents say the measure is worded such that the majority of the state tax revenue would be distributed to drug research treatment and enforcement PERIOD In addition  percent of the remaining revenue will be used for youth programs including drug education prevention and treatment PERIOD Twenty percent would go to prevent and alleviate environmental damage from illegal marijuana producers PERIOD The other  percent would be used for programs designed to reduce driving under the influence of marijuana and to support a grant program designed to reduce negative impacts on health or safety resulting from the proposition PERIOD

By and large students at Sonoma State University say they are supportive of the legalization attempt because of the health benefits marijuana provides PERIOD Furthermore students who support Proposition  perceive marijuana to be safer than most over the counter medicines PERIOD On the other hand some of those who are against proposition  believe marijuana is a gateway drug and it can still lead up to using other hardcore drugs or eventually develop an addiction PERIOD In addition those against Proposition  worry that people will begin to drive under the influence because there is no bloodalcohollike test for marijuana PERIOD Throughout my entire high school years I suffered a lot of anxiety and pressure to get into a UC PERIOD Once I made the decision to settle for Sonoma State University I thought the work load would get easier but it didnt said Emilio Oliveros a Sonoma State student who got his legal medical marijuana card during his freshman year of college PERIOD I found myself experiencing more anxiety to keep a . gPA so I went to therapy to find a way to cope with it PERIOD Rather than taking six prescription pills I asked if marijuana could be another solution PERIOD Once I started it definitely changed my perception on my life in a positive way and continues to offer a different perspective outside the box we live in. as opposed to previous generations the millennials have much more information about the longterm effects of marijuana which makes the topic easier to approach PERIOD

As a millennial we grew up in an era where marijuana was and still is used as a substitute for over the counter medicine or recreational use said Kevin Valencia a Sonoma State student who does not have a medicinal marijuana card PERIOD Before our generation marijuana was taboo because we did not fully understand the effects and long term symptoms it causes PERIOD Now that we do public figures are more open about it because our generation perceives it as medicine rather than a harmful drug. for Sonoma State students Proposition  would not have an impact on campus housing PERIOD Director of Campus Housing Nicole Hendry said the campus will not only remain a smokefree campus but students who receive funds from the federal government such as financial aid and research grants requires the university to comply with the federal laws PERIOD Even though California may legalize marijuana the federal government still considers it illegal PERIOD

Studies on drug policy state black and Latino communities are disproportionately targeted incarcerated and damaged by discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws PERIOD As a result by voting yes on Proposition  this unregulated market would be protected under the rule of law PERIOD Furthermore it would reduce and eliminate criminal penalties for marijuana offenses and overall reduce the harmful impact in discriminatory criminalization PERIOD

According to the California Growers Association in  there were  felony arrests and  misdemeanor arrests for cannabis PERIOD In  there were   felony arrests and  misdemeanor arrests for cannabis PERIOD

There have been concerns expressed that the economic impacts of Proposition  will actually increase crime in communities where cannabis is prevalent PERIOD There is significant evidence that socioeconomic conditions are related to crime according to the California Growers Associations website citing concerns with the proposition PERIOD Simply put less jobs lead to more crimes PERIOD Consolidating the cannabis industry will result in catastrophic economic collapse for huge swaths of California and the impacts will be especially acute in communities where cannabis is prevalent. on the other hand the Drug Policy Action Campaign supports Proposition  PERIOD because small growers will be able to start up their businesses thanks to the delay in cultivation license done by the Adult Use of Marijuana Act  PERIOD As a result small growers will have the opportunity to establish themselves in the market and Proposition  restricts large producers from integrating with each other by forming a monopoly PERIOD

Furthermore the Drug Policy Action Campaign believes this will lower crime by offering people an opportunity to start a growing business and Proposition  will help alleviate the overburdened criminal justice system from petty marijuana possessions PERIOD
