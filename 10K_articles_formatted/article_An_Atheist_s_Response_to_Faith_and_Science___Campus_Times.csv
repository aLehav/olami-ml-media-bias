The undergraduate student body at UR iscomposed predominantlyof engineering and premedical students and as such I feel safe in assuming that Evan Keegans opinions article Science and Faith was of great interest to many who happened to read the Jan PERIOD  issue of Campus Times PERIOD Though the piece was wellwritten and I appreciate anyone who thinks deeply on issues of theological and scientific importance I feel compelled to make a few corrections about the claims made by the writer PERIOD

First I would like to refute the first proposition set forth by the writer science is in fact not a belief as religion is PERIOD It isnt something based upon faith PERIOD Science is a methodology a selfcorrective means of understanding natural phenomena through careful experimentation PERIOD Belief as implicitly defined by the writer has nothing to do with understanding PERIOD It has to do with feelings and intuitions PERIOD Feelings and intuitions are indeed powerful psychological forces but when it comes to trying to unlock the secrets of existence they are inadequate PERIOD We accept easy answers before we accept difficult ones and that is why religion falls short of science PERIOD Our feelings and intuitions provide easy answers whereas the careful progress of science provides concepts that are often difficult to understand and painful to accept PERIOD

The writer used gravity as an example of something which cannot be directly or fully explained and yet is generally accepted to be true but Im afraid this argument simply does not stand PERIOD This is what is sometimes referred to as the God of the gaps PERIOD We lack information about a topic and so fill in the missing information with a simple idea God did it PERIOD The problem with this manner of thinking and it is a very dangerous problem indeed is that it results in a sort of complacency with ignorance PERIOD If we think we can delegate comprehension to the copout of God did it then we lose the drive to actually learn PERIOD God was once used to explain weather phenomena the biological diversity of Earth the nature of matter and a whole host of other things PERIOD That is until we discovered climate patterns and geology evolution by natural selection and atomic theory PERIOD

Would we have gained this knowledge had the great thinkers of the human race been content with God did it I think not PERIOD Science has a tendency to fill in these gaps PERIOD God is running out of hiding places PERIOD

I dont claim to know much about physics and I doubt my mathematical capacity would stand the test of attempting to elucidate the nature of gravity or quantum entanglement PERIOD Keegan seems to suggest that he has a knowledge of these things which I admit I lack PERIOD But the God of the gaps is an old argument one which needs to be retired and I cannot see how quantum particles existing outside of spacetime justify the belief that a conscious omnipotent omniscient Creator exists outside of spacetime unless one thinks that God is a quantum particle PERIOD

I am of the opinion that when we encounter a lack of knowledge we must face it courageously and headon with a desire to shine a light upon the abyss of missing understanding we see gaping before us PERIOD Hiding behind the myths of ancient MiddleEastern nomads might be comforting for some but it isnt going to help us now PERIOD

Keegan asks the question if we can believe in such inexplicable scientific theories why should it be ridiculous to believe in a God who exists outside of time However these theories are not of course inexplicable PERIOD Indeed the very fact that scientists refer to them as theories means that they are explicable since theory is defined within the scientific community as a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena according the the MerriamWebster Dictionary PERIOD Theories arent inexplicable their very purpose is explanation PERIOD

Furthermore a single word is enough to explain why some such as myself find the idea of God ridiculous evidence PERIOD Science is in a way nothing but evidence coupled with predictions based upon the evidence already gathered PERIOD Religion has no evidence in its favor PERIOD There are claims made in the Bible which are obvious fallacies such as the notion that the universe as we see it today was created in a matter of days as opposed to billions of years PERIOD Once science found these creeds to be untrue the religious decided that days was really just a metaphor PERIOD I remain unconvinced all the same PERIOD

Scientific claims are not based upon assumption PERIOD They are based upon hypotheses and rigorous attempts to disprove such hypotheses PERIOD When it seems that a hypothesis stands after all the rigorous testing intended to disprove it we accept it to be true PERIOD Science constantly fixes its own mistakes and as an enterprise carried out by imperfect humans mistakes will of course be made PERIOD Religion however rather than being selfcorrecting has remained more or less unchanged PERIOD If the Bible was holy over two thousand years ago it must continue to be holy today PERIOD When scientific evidence comes along that seems to dispro ve religious claims religion either reinterprets dogma or sticks its fingers in its ears and hums to itself until the nasty thoughts reluctantly go away PERIOD This does not seem like a mature way to conduct oneself in the modern world PERIOD

The truth is science and religion are in conflict and science is winning PERIOD This conflict goes deeper than the fact that religion makes untrue claims which science eventually proves false it is far more about the manner of thinking prevalent in the respective fields PERIOD Whereas religion generally dislikes being critically examined science is predicated upon it PERIOD Scientists want to be proven incorrect if their hypothesis is not accurate PERIOD But the religious hypothesis of God resists experimentation or even critical reasoning PERIOD You may believe in God if you like but dont make the mistake of thinking religion to be just as valid as science PERIOD
