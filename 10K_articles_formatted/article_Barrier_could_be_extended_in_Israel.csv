JERUSALEM AP  Israel is considering two plans to extend a barrier separating Israelis from Palestinians officials said yesterday PERIOD Both would likely claim more land for Israel and muddy progress on a U.S.backed plan for Palestinian statehood PERIOD

Israel says the electronic fences and cement blocks that Israelis have been calling a separation fence are meant to protect Israel proper and Jewish settlements from attacks by Palestinian militants PERIOD

The barriers do not run strictly along the border of undisputed Israeli territory instead they bite in several areas into the West Bank which the Palestinians claim as the heartland of a future state incorporating thousands of Jewish settlers  and Palestinians PERIOD

Two proposals revealed yesterday would increase the amount of land the Palestinians would lose compared to previous plans although an exact figure was not available PERIOD Israeli officials said the barriers could be demolished and moved if and when a permanent border is set for a Palestinian state PERIOD

Palestinian Cabinet minister Saeb Erekat accused Israel of trying to sabotage international peace efforts at a time when the worlds attention is diverted by the fighting in Iraq PERIOD

This is part of Israels exploitation of the war in Iraq Erekat said PERIOD He said he would seek clarifications from international mediators PERIOD

Skeptical Palestinians and human rights groups also called it an illegal land grab and said that the new barriers would in effect dislocate more than  Palestinians leaving them on the Israeli side of an imposed border PERIOD

Before these new proposals Palestinians were going to lose between  to  percent of land in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem PERIOD Now its more like  percent said Michael Tarazi legal adviser to the PLO PERIOD The West Banks total size is about  square miles slightly larger than Delaware PERIOD

Israel began constructing a barrier last year to try to keep out Palestinian militants PERIOD Only a few miles of the fence have been completed PERIOD

According to the initial plan parts of the fence were to run along the nowinvisible Green Line which demarcated the frontier before Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the  Mideast war PERIOD Other stretches were to run somewhat further to the east encompassing several West Bank villages with about  residents PERIOD

The Haaretz newspaper said one new proposal involves moving the fence further west in a way that would link to Israel several clusters of settlements PERIOD

Yehezkel Lein of Btselem an Israeli human rights group said the main impact will be that the movement of Palestinians will be restricted and many  we estimate   will lose work be cut off from the land or face other restrictions. the other proposal would extend the fence east of the main Palestinian cities in the hilly center of the West Bank in effect creating a buffer between the West Bank and Jordan and linking to Israel the Jordan River Valley where several thousands settlers live PERIOD

Defense Ministry spokeswoman Rachel NiedakAshkenazi confirmed the reports in principle but would not go into details PERIOD The raison dtre of the fence is to protect Jewish Israeli settlements from security threats she said PERIOD If and when peace negotiations take place the borders will be moved PERIOD The fence is only made of concrete and wire and can be brought down just like the Berlin Wall. defense officials will formally present the proposal for the western barrier to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in coming days PERIOD It is unclear when the eastern proposal will be discussed PERIOD

Questions abound on how the proposed barriers will affect Palestinian villages caught in between PERIOD

It appeared unlikely that Palestinians on the Israeli side of the fence would be offered Israeli citizenship at least before any peace deal PERIOD
