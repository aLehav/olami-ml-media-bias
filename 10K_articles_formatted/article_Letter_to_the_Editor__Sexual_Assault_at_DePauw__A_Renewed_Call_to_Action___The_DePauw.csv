7089,2023-11-04,"for years I was aware that sexual assault was a major problem on college campuses and I was familiar with the sobering statistics regarding sexual assault PERIOD However these facts were simply detached impersonal knowledge until two years ago when one of my students shared with me their story of being raped PERIOD By a friend PERIOD At DePauw PERIOD While passed out PERIOD

This was the first time a survivor had shared their story with me and suddenly sexual assault was no longer an abstract conceptual problem characterized by cold statistics but rather a concrete real problem impacting someone I cared about  one of my students PERIOD Sexual assault now had a name a face a person with real pain real tears and real consequences PERIOD

And this motivated me to learn even more about sexual assault to learn about the programs and services offered at the Womens Center and Title IX office and to participate in activities such as Code TEAL and Green Dot training PERIOD It also motivated me to become more active and publicly vocal about sexual assault and rape culture PERIOD

After becoming more publicly active dozens of survivors shared their stories with me  men women and nonbinary LGBTQ and straight faculty staff students friends and even strangers PERIOD And each of these stories put a name and a face to the statistics confirmed the extent to which sexual assault is a major problem on our campus and in our community and provided testimony to the devastating impact sexual assault has on survivors PERIOD

April is sexual assault awareness month and I encourage each of us to use this as an opportunity to become more educated about sexual assault and work toward eliminating it PERIOD We can all learn about and practice enthusiastic consent we can participate in programs such as Green Dot offered by our Title IX office and Womens Center we can learn to recognize precursors to sexual assault and learn how to appropriately intervene we can encourage organizations to which we belong e.g. department greek organization club team etc. to openly and honestly discuss healthy and consensual sex and we can stop making excuses for sexual assault e.g. she was drunk they were asking for it its just part of our campus culture etc. pERIOD

And most importantly when a survivor musters the courage to share their story we must start by believing them making sure theyre safe supporting them in any way we can and encouraging them to take advantage of services offered by the Counseling Center Womens Center and Title IX office PERIOD

I truly believe we can make our campus and community safer spaces free of sexual assault and powerbased violence especially if we all work together PERIOD Lets get to work PERIOD
