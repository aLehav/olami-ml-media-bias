8962,2023-11-04,"when the topic of HIVAIDS arises there are some conclusions that many agree on PERIOD Is it a problem that needs immediate attention Yes PERIOD Can education and outreach reduce the infection rate of the disease Absolutely PERIOD How exactly are we going to do this Well  no one really knows the answer to that and if they do it usually involves a seemingly radical solution PERIOD

Along with education outreach and free HIV testing and counseling services the Minnesota AIDS Project MAP has taken a more aggressive stance to combat the spread of HIV infection in Minnesota particularly in the Twin Cities area PERIOD One of their methods frequently comes under fire in outreach sessions their needle exchange program PERIOD

The needle exchange vehicle dubbed the Mainline is a refurbished van created to service clients in the Metro Area PERIOD The van includes an inside office where clients can exchange their used needles for clean ones and receive testing referrals and condoms PERIOD

Naturally many individuals oppose this program claiming that it enables intravenous drug users to continue using both recreational and hard drugs thereby counteracting the true purpose of the Minnesota AIDS Project PERIOD

I was skeptical of the program myself when I learned of it in an HIV educator training course two weekends ago PERIOD While I was sure MAP had legitimate reasons for the syringe exchange program I wanted more information about its creation PERIOD MAP anticipated this opposition and with their facts and the statistics I have to say that their argument convinced me PERIOD

For one the program hardly enables intravenous substance users PERIOD MAP shies away from using the word addict as some people might not identify with this word and therefore ignore the muchneeded information PERIOD MAPs stance is that these substance users will continue in their practices despite what health officials and experts say and the program chooses to focus on the greater issue  HIV transmission  rather than attempting to halt intravenous drug use PERIOD Focusing on drug use is not their primary mission in this case PERIOD

Through the syringe exchange program MAP is able to communicate with their clients and form relationships in a nonthreatening environment PERIOD In this way those who come to exchange their syringes also have access to information on HIVAIDS trained professionals willing to walk them through situations and an overall safety net if they choose to stop using drugs PERIOD

Sharing needles poses an extremely high risk of HIV transmission PERIOD According to the MAP training program where others states rate of HIV transmission through needles is  percent Minnesotas rate is  percent PERIOD This extreme difference is partially a result of this strong exchange program PERIOD MAP should be commended for their work not belittled by others who refuse to learn the facts PERIOD

The Minnesota AIDS Project uses groundbreaking and progressive methods to combat the rate of HIV infection PERIOD The syringe exchange program is one such method PERIOD Many opponents of this program fail to realize the prevalence of HIV and the misinformed and uneducated voices must not drown out the proven efficacy of this program PERIOD
