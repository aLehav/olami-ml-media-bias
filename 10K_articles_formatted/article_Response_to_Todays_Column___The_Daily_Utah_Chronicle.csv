I would like to take issue with a few of the points made by Mr PERIOD Jason Jones in his January fourteenth editorial PERIOD Although right on many points he fails to address the issues of Iraq adequately so I feel I must intervene PERIOD

Mr PERIOD Jones addresses the idea of freeing more than  million people PERIOD He speaks of murderous regimes and suffering under dictatorships PERIOD Apparently he has forgotten President Bushs motivation for going to war PERIOD In a June fifth  speech Bush spoke of revealing the truth about the weapons of mass destruction PERIOD The only truth he has revealed is the fact that there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq PERIOD

Not only is Mr PERIOD Jones wrong on that point but he fails to make the connection that Syria a country aiding in capturing terrorists is a nation under an oppressive military regime PERIOD Perhaps we should free these people instead of embracing them

What about North Korea Apparently the  million people suffering under the smashing hand of Kim Chongil PERIOD At least this country admits to trying to develop these weapons of mass destruction. president Bush has certainly made some advances in economics and other areas of his responsibility however he has ruined relationships held to the United States benefit with many of our allies PERIOD
