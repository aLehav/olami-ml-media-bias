The LSU Museum of Art grows its photography collection in the last several years and opens a new photography exhibition on Saturday April   PERIOD

A new photography exhibition at the LSU Museum of Art is helping propel the museums permanent collection into the twenty-first century PERIOD

Exploring Photography Works from the Permanent Collection celebrates the diversity of photographic techniques and the possibilities photography brings to the publics experience of the museum PERIOD LSU Museum of Art executive director Daniel Stetson said the exhibit also celebrates the growth of the photography collection which has doubled since spring  PERIOD

Stetson said a significant donation from The Museum Project a consortium of artists led by Robert von Sternberg and Darryl Curran resulted in donations from  artists ranging from two or four pieces to as many as  per person PERIOD The gift added considerable range to the collections large groupings of black and white and mid1900s photographs increasing the number of female artists production techniques and color in the museums holdings he said PERIOD

Exploring Photography displays over  works from the full collection including works from the  new photographers as well as two new works by noted photographer Diane Arbus another recent donation PERIOD

Assistant photography professor Kristine Thompson said the scale of the exhibition is exciting because it takes the viewer through a journey of photographys growth and advancement PERIOD Black and white prints hang beside digital abstractions and you can turn a corner and come face to face with everything from work by a University alumnus to a Diane Arbus she said PERIOD

Photography has always been a democratic medium and today most people experience photography through dispensable digital media Thompson said PERIOD Students and community members gain a deeper appreciation for photography when they take time to engage with photographs in a tangible form and consider the dramatic strides the medium has taken since its debut in the 1800s she said PERIOD

I think maybe we take for granted how much experimentation there has been over the history of the medium Thompson said PERIOD

The exhibition also serves as a catalyst for discussion about how photography enhances other media and deepens the viewers understanding of different time perods Stetson said PERIOD Photographys documentary aspects allow people to travel through the eyes of the photographer and gain a deeper appreciation for the human experience PERIOD

Stetson decided to create a dialogue around these ideas by placing a double portrait of an AfricanAmerican couple in postKatrina New Orleans by photographer Thomas Neff in the more traditional painting gallery PERIOD He said the intermingling of the modern portrait with painted portraits from as early as the sixteenth century reflects on the continuation of life and how different artistic styles can build on one another PERIOD

Stetson said whether museum patrons engage in these deeper conversations or take a more casual look at the exhibition he hopes visitors walk away with a sense of the collections possibilities PERIOD

You really get to explore how far photography can go he said PERIOD I hope they see some things that they love PERIOD I hope that kind of magic happens. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
