Joey Dance wins a match against his NC State opponent on Feb PERIOD   PERIOD

This Sunday Virginia Techs wrestling team matched up against a highly anticipated opponent No PERIOD  Penn State PERIOD As fans began to jump to Enter Sandman the sixthranked Hokies prepared themselves for what might be their toughest matchup of the season PERIOD Supporters of the program were electric as the lineups were called and with a record attendance of  people their excitement was palpable PERIOD

The Hokies already coming off a big win against 13thranked Iowa State looked ready and intimidating to take on the former fourtime national champions in the last five years PERIOD Despite the easy  win over Iowa State the Hokies knew that this was an entirely different game PERIOD

Oh yeah there was a big difference against Iowa State and Penn State said Head Coach Kevin Dresser PERIOD Nothing against Iowa State but Penn State is a different animal and I knew it would be. virginia Tech started strong in the first three matches with two wins secured by Joey Dance and Solomon Chishko PERIOD Dances performance was particularly impressive winning  with a takedown in the last second to earn his teams first match points PERIOD At the end of three rounds the Hokies led  PERIOD

Despite an impressive start Virginia Tech did not look strong during the middle of the contest PERIOD Sal Mastriani a usually solid option for the Hokies lost his matchup  which resulted in a technical fall and rewarded six more points to Penn State putting the Hokies down  PERIOD

Techs only other win for the day was freshman David McFadden in the sixth round PERIOD The Hokies then lost the next four rounds during their heavier weight classes and lost the match .The final round was forfeited when the Hokies realized they had no way of coming back PERIOD

Virginia Techs loss was certainly visible on each of the players faces after the match even those who won PERIOD

We had some matches where you could tell we really werent moving that well probably something to do with weight management but overall when you look at it obviously were not happy Dance said PERIOD Obviously I wasnt happy with the way I wrestled just because I didnt really feel that great so going into the match of course you always want to win and thats what pushed me through. dresser was not pleased with his heavier weight classes on his team and was especially hard on players Zach Epperly and Nick Brascetta PERIOD

You know Nick Bascetta was a little hesitant on the bottom and got ridden and that affected him in that match but you know preach effort all the time and Knowles is really good but I think Brascetta is really really good Dresser said PERIOD I think Zach Epperly has to decide whether he is going to wrestle or if he is going to not wrestle PERIOD You know he has to get tougher PERIOD For a guy that has as many tools as he does he just is not very tough right now PERIOD Dresser said PERIOD  McFadden said PERIOD Its just kind of what our teams about. learning from this loss is crucial for the Hokies success as they hope to repeat their success in winning the ACC PERIOD Techs next matchups will be against South Dakota State and North Dakota State on Nov PERIOD  and  respectively PERIOD
