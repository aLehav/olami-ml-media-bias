The Time Travelers Wife won the  Exclusive Books Boeke Prize and a  British Book Award PERIOD The novel was published in  and a film version starring Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana was released in  PERIOD The novel has sold over five million copies and has been translated into  languages PERIOD

The Time Travelers Wife is a love story about a female artist Clare and her husband Henry who has a genetic disorder that causes him to time travel unpredictably PERIOD Henry first meets Clare when he is  and she is  but Clare meets Henry for the first time when she is  and Henry is  PERIOD Henry is involuntarily pulled to random moments in the past present or future and Clares linear and normal adolescence is dotted with memories of Henry appearing to her from different moments in time PERIOD

Clare struggles with the turmoil of always being the one left behind to wait for Henry to reappear and Henrys inability to take clothing or identification with him while he time travels leaves him helpless and dependent on his survival skills PERIOD The intersection of Clare and Henrys life is not ordinary and Niffeneggers edgy style complimented by themes of love death sex and time make The Time Travelers Wife a suspenseful and exciting read PERIOD

Audrey Niffenegger is a perfect guest for NDLF senior Felicia Aguirre chair of the Literary Festival said PERIOD She is a popular and entertaining writer but she also has a unique and interesting writing style PERIOD

In a world where art seems unstable Audrey Niffenegger fights for tradition PERIOD She is both an artist and a writer and produces handpainted books PERIOD In fact when Niffenegger originally got the idea for The Time Travelers Wife it came to her just as a title on her sketchpad PERIOD She soon figured out it would make a better novel than a picture book PERIOD I think students will be able to learn from Niffenegger how to participate in an everchanging artistic world Aguirre said PERIOD

Niffenegger is most recognized for her novel but has enjoyed success in other fields as well PERIOD Niffenegger is a professor and has produced numerous drawings paintings prints and visual books PERIOD She helped found the Columbia College Chicago Center for Book and Paper Arts and was a professor at Columbia Colleges MFA program in Interdisciplinary Book and Paper Arts PERIOD She is now on the faculty of the Columbia College Fiction Writing Department PERIOD
