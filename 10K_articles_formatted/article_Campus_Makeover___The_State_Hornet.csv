The implementation of Destination  takes a step forward this week as the university changes the schools three entrance signs altering the logo and adding backlighting PERIOD

The formal name of the university  California State University Sacramento  will still be featured on the signs along with the universitys  identity change to Sacramento State PERIOD

However Frank Whitlatch associate vice president of Public Affairs said the change adds Sacramento States campus seal replacing the CSUwide seal that appeared on the old signs PERIOD

Whitlatch described the campus seal as an oval with the university name and founding year  PERIOD

It will be green and gold and will be in line with the color hues used since the announcement of Destination  Whitlatch said PERIOD

Osaki Design which also designed Sac States new logo last year and is designing its identity package crated the new signage scheme PERIOD

Whitlatch said the project from inception to completion will cost  for the three signs  two on J Street and one on College Town Drive PERIOD

Pacific Neon won the bidding process for manufacturing and installing the signs which starts Tuesday Whitlatch said PERIOD Each sign should take two to three days to complete PERIOD

The new signs will not be letters affixed to the concrete slab like the old signs were PERIOD Instead the signs will be aluminum which allows for backlighting at night Whitlatch said PERIOD

People tell me all the time they dont see the entrance when driving down J Street Whitlatch said PERIOD The key point to the new signs is theyll be more noticeable there will be a more striking entrance at both ends of campus. bridge may get new colors

The 600foot Guy West Bridge now a salmon color has lost the glimmer of its original golden luster PERIOD

Twenty years since the bridges last makeover the university wants to have the bridge repainted but because it is owned by the City of Sacramento and is under the department of parks and recreation the overdue makeover is on the citys todo list and will get done when there is money to do it said Matt Altier director of University Enterprises Inc PERIOD

According to Sac State Magazine a green and gold color scheme for the towers with the schools name spanning the length of the bridge is the current project under consideration PERIOD

With the possibility of having a green and gold colored bridge some students felt that the new colors would take away from its original meaning PERIOD

Sophomore Lyndsey Vaden said Personally it would be nice to be school colors but we have plenty of things that are school colors so its kind of nice that its a mini Golden Gate Bridge. the rumor around campus is that a senior engineering major designed the Guy West Bridge PERIOD However the rumor is merely a legend that hasnt been proven either way said Lori Hall with Public Affairs PERIOD

The bridge built in the mid 1960s and was named in honor of Guy West the first president of Sac State when the school opened in  PERIOD

According to the magazine Ted DAmico then executive vice president of the Spink Corp. a Sacramentobased engineering firm designed the bridge PERIOD

When built the bridge was hailed as the longest foot suspension bridge in the United States. norm Erickson and Alicia LozaPonce can be reached at emailprotected
