9396,2020-10-21,"the Constitution of the United States is dead dead dead. yet our views on how government should interact in our lives  with the economy with social issues  all rely on this founding document PERIOD The Constitution was ratified in  and the Founding Fathers gave original meaning to each article and amendment and now it is dead PERIOD It is the job of the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution using the meaning it was given by the Founding Fathers PERIOD



Marbury vs PERIOD Madison set the precedent for the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution PERIOD As a result whoever controls the majority of justices on the Supreme Court controls the governing constitutional interpretation and the ideological backbone of the U.S PERIOD Originalism is the only interpretation that protects and promotes democracy freedom and a stable political system PERIOD It is a judicial interpretation that aims to closely follow the original meaning of those who drafted it PERIOD When we support the opposite interpretation that the Constitution is a living and breathing document intended to adapt immediately to the latest societal changes we start to stray from the original meaning PERIOD Treating it in this way slowly begins to undermine democracy and the foundation of our country set up by the Founding Fathers PERIOD By promoting a living and breathing governing document we leave interpretations of the Constitution up to the whims of modernday adjudicators and risk our country becoming transient and fickle PERIOD We have to respect the original ideas of the Founding Fathers PERIOD With too many changes to constitutional interpretation on a casebycase basis we erode judicial legitimacy PERIOD

In contrast the Declaration of Independence is not a governing document PERIOD It had a practical purpose and it had elements of forward thinking PERIOD Because this document does not govern it should be seen as alive PERIOD It served as a call to rebellion when it was written and today it serves as a living document PERIOD Thomas Jefferson himself applied forward thought when he wrote that all men are created equal. however one of Jeffersons greatest fears was that the young nation would not survive PERIOD A loose and subjective interpretation of the Constitution directly threatens the legitimacy and survival of a nation PERIOD It becomes a threat to the country when a judge sitting in an unelected position tries to attach their personal modernday opinion to a 245yearold governing document PERIOD

By engaging in the text of the Constitution and seeking original meaning we gain insight into the minds of the men that structured this country PERIOD For example the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights does not allow for gun rights to be restricted and the Eighth Amendment does not mean the death penalty is unconstitutional PERIOD People were executed for petty theft in the 1700s PERIOD The Eighth Amendment which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment was written to stop people from being tarred and feathered or burnt at the stake PERIOD If we look at the context in which the Constitution was written and who is writing the document we can begin to understand what an amendment or article means and how it should be applied PERIOD

Instead of leaving interpretations that were not clearly outlined by the Founding Fathers up to nine unelected justices there exists an option brilliantly included in the Constitution PERIOD We have a way to amend and add or subtract from our constitutional rights PERIOD It was not meant to be an easy process PERIOD If core principles and beliefs could change so quickly our country would become transient and leave behind founding ideals PERIOD Yet it is not something that is impossible we have  constitutional amendments PERIOD If as a country we reach the point at which we want to outlaw the death penalty or restrict gun rights then this can be done PERIOD

Our country must adapt and change with the times and the way that our governing document can do this is through the amendment process PERIOD The danger lies in allowing a justice to interpret the Constitution in a way that does not follow the original meaning PERIOD An activist judge drives us away from fundamental principles PERIOD If we abandon the meaning which Jefferson Madison and their peers attached to our founding documents our democracy will not survive and our principles become meaningless PERIOD

It is obvious that Jeffersons interpretation of the Constitution evolved when he became president to a much stronger executive role PERIOD  From a practical point of view Hamilton and the original Jeffersonian interpretation were quite different PERIOD  Adams and Jefferson had many differences PERIOD  Just exactly how are justices determine the the original meaning of a document that has been amended  times PERIOD  What would Jefferson and Madison make of the fourteenth amendment   The original document did not even have the Bill of Rights PERIOD

It is obvious there never has been one original meaning to those tens of thousands who voted to ratify the Constitution PERIOD",The Constitution Is A Dead Document â€“ Old Gold & Black,Wake Forest University
