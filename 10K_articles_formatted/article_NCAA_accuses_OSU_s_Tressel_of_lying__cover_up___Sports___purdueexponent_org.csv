COLUMBUS Ohio AP  In a sharply worded rebuke of Ohio States
Jim Tressel the NCAA on Monday accused the 10year coach with
withholding information and lying to keep Buckeyes players on the
field who had accepted improper benefits from the owner of a tattoo
parlor PERIOD

In a  sent to the school the NCAA said
Monday that the violations relating to the coach are considered


Ohio State was not cited for the most serious of institutional
breaches since Tressel hid information from his superiors for more
than nine months PERIOD The university has  days to respond to the
ruling body of college sports request for information before a
scheduled date before the NCAAs committee on infractions on Aug PERIOD
 in Indianapolis PERIOD

In a 13page indictment of Tressels behavior the NCAA alleged
that Tressel had  It also
said he 
and said he was lying when he filled out a compliance form in
September which said he had no knowledge of any NCAA violations by
any of his players PERIOD

Athletic director Gene Smith said he would have  The university issued a statement that the
allegations were consistent with what it had already selfreported
to the NCAA on March  PERIOD

Tressels troubles began with an April   email from Columbus
lawyer Christopher Cicero PERIOD Cicero a former Ohio State walkon
player informed Tressel that a federal agency had raided the house
of tattooshop owner Eddie Rife and discovered a multitude of
autographed Ohio State jerseys cleats pants and helmets Big Ten
championship rings and the  trinkets given to Buckeyes
players for beating archrival Michigan PERIOD

Tressel responded 

Yet he did not notify Smith or Ohio State President E PERIOD Gordon Gee
anyone else in the athletic department the NCAA compliance
department or anyone in the universitys legal department PERIOD
Instead he forwarded the email to Jeannette Pa. businessman Ted
Sarniak a friend and mentor to star quarterback Terrelle Pryor
who was subsequently discovered to be one of the players involved
with Rife PERIOD

The Columbus Dispatch reported Monday that Tressel went on to
exchange at least  emails with Cicero and also had numerous
lengthy telephone conversations with Sarniak over the weeks and
months ahead PERIOD Tressel still did not tell any of his superiors
anyone at the NCAA or his own compliance or legal
departments PERIOD

In September of  Tressel even signed a mandatory and rather
routine Ohio State compliance form which clearly and simply asks if
he the coach has knowledge of any NCAA violations PERIOD By signing and
dating it he said that he did not PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD Attorney contacted Ohio State in December to notify the
university that it had come across the memorabilia PERIOD That prompted a
cursory investigation  Smith conceded to The Associated Press last
week that the effort was rushed  that did not turn up the telltale
emails between Cicero and Tressel but did uncover the players
involvement with Rife PERIOD After consulting with the NCAA and the Big
Ten Pryor and four other top players were handed fivegame
suspensions  curiously not including the next game the Sugar
Bowl but beginning with the first five games of the 
season PERIOD

Tressel was asked at a news conference if the players knew they
were doing something wrong PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

At the same time he said that Tressel later admitted he was
covering up his own knowledge of the players
violations PERIOD

The NCAA and Ohio State say the case against the players is
closed PERIOD

It was only when Ohio State began appealing the players
suspensions that it uncovered the emails leading to Tressel
ultimately receiving a fivegame suspension and a  fine PERIOD
Smith said last week that the fine given to Tressel  who makes
around . million a year  would not cover Ohio States costs of
the investigation PERIOD

Tressel has a record of  at Ohio State and won the 
national championship the Buckeyes first in  years PERIOD His team
went  last season including the  win over Arkansas in the
Sugar Bowl PERIOD

The NCAA could accept Ohio States suggestion of sanctions  the
fivegame suspension and the fine  or could levy much more severe
penalties PERIOD Since the NCAA says that Tressel knowingly used
ineligible players it would seem probable that the  regular
season would be vacated  ending the Buckeyes run of Big Ten
titles at six in a row PERIOD The NCAA could also come down hard on
Tressel compelling Ohio State to add to Tressels suspension or
issue sanctions leading to the school firing him PERIOD
