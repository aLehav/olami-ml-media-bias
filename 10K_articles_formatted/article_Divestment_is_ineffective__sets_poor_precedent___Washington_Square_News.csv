One of the most contentious debates taking place on college campuses around the country revolves around the call for universities to divest their endowments from companies in the fossil fuel industry PERIOD NYU Divest recently called on potential benefactors to stop donating to NYU until the university divests from the top  coal oil and gas companies. with over  individuals and  institutions pledging to pull their assets from the fossil fuel industry this is a cause that is clearly gaining significant traction but the significance of this movement is not at all apparent PERIOD In fact divestment will likely have no significant financial effect on the fossil fuel industry and distracts the public from more concrete reforms that can be made to combat climate change PERIOD

Divestment websites commonly refer to the divest campaigns against the South African Apartheid regime as an example of successful reform spurred by college divestment PERIOD However the academic literature on the subject is far from conclusive PERIOD In fact a report published in the University of Chicago Journal of Business found that valuations of targeted companies or even the South African financial markets were not easily visibly affected. the South African case is also distinct in that the end goal of the movement was much more clear to halt investment until Apartheid policies collapsed PERIOD There is no comparable solution to the fossil fuel campaign fossil fuels still make up  percent of U.S PERIOD energy consumption and its unclear how divestment will alter that paradigm PERIOD

To their credit many divestment activists acknowledge the limited economic impact that their campaign will have on the fossil fuel industry  NYU Divest concedes as much on their website PERIOD Instead they say their movement is a symbolic protest to raise awareness PERIOD This perspective unfortunately ignores the real effect shareholders can have in creating positive change in companies they own a stake in PERIOD Following the  Exxon Valdez oil spill pensioners who owned  billion of company stock successfully pressured Exxon to accept an environmentalist on its board and increase spending on environmental research PERIOD By giving up its stake in the fossil fuel industry NYU sells away its voice and ability to shape industry practices to investors that are less environmentally conscious PERIOD

Perhaps the most significant harm that the divestment movement poses is that it deceives the public into thinking that pulling investment from an industry is an important step towards creating reform PERIOD Already we see a proliferation of divest campaigns that target private prisons Israeli defense and poor labor practices but do little in terms of pushing for tangible change PERIOD Promoting government investment in clean energy phasing out fossil fuels from our own institutions and calling for legislation that curbs carbon emissions are all much more direct ways of tackling climate change PERIOD If we want to create substantial reform in our society we have to move away from symbolic dissent and fight for the changes we truly need PERIOD

If you want to see what the actual rationales for divestment are nothing to do with direct financial impact to the companies involved so theres nothing to concede see the letters on the subject from Harvard Faculty for Divestment

httpwww.harvardfacultydivest.com

There are many other cogent sources of information on the subject but thats one of them PERIOD","Divestment is ineffective, sets poor precedent - Washington Square News",New York University
