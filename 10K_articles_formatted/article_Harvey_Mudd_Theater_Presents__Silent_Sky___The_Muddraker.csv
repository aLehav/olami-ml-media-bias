QA by Natalie Couch and Lauren West Designed by Kaitlynn Gray

Inspired by dual passions for theater and science senior Kaanthi Pandhigunta decided to direct the play Silent Sky. silent Sky is a play about female astronomer Henrietta Leavitt and her dedication to the stars PERIOD Pandhigunta organized the studentrun Muddonly production and gave The Muddraker a behind thescenes look at the December production PERIOD

Q When did the play open

A Silent Sky happened on Dec PERIOD  and  in the Drinkward Recital Hall PERIOD It was free but there were feeless tickets anyway since there were a limited number of seats PERIOD

Q What inspired you to put on this play

A I was in a play called Isaacs Eye my freshman year PERIOD It was to my knowledge the first studentled theater production at Harvey Mudd PERIOD It was super fun and really nice because it was in a way made for Mudders PERIOD Isaacs Eye was a fairly low time commitment compared to Pomona theater PERIOD I had also tried Pomona theater in freshman year but it was just too much work PERIOD Pomona theater was maybe four hours of rehearsal every day PERIOD Isaacs Eye was a really good experience and I made a lot of awesome friends through it PERIOD So I wanted to continue that and create the opportunity for future Mudders to also participate in theater PERIOD

Q Why did you choose Silent Sky

A I thought Silent Sky was a good play for Harvey Mudd because its a blend of science and the human side PERIOD Its about female astronomers in the 1900s and what they had to overcome to make a mark in their field PERIOD

Q What were some challenges

A One was getting the HSA department to give us course credit for Silent Sky. they eventually did and it was really nice of Prof PERIOD Fandell to do that but we had to jump through a lot of hoops to get there PERIOD Now a few of us are getting course credit including the stage managers the set designer some of the dance choreographers and me PERIOD Others are not doing it for credit PERIOD The difference is that people getting credit have to spend nine hours each week on the play PERIOD

Q What were the best parts of putting on the play

A The best part has been just seeing how talented everyone is PERIOD So many people have brought their talents to the play PERIOD For example we have music composers who have composed beautiful pieces for the show and it was like Oh my God I didnt even know you could do that. and then we have our dance choreographers who are creating some awesome dances and our set designers and sound designers  they really know what theyre doing PERIOD And also obviously the actors PERIOD So its really awesome to see how talented everyone is PERIOD

Q Do you think that someone will be inspired to carry on the mantle like you did from Isaacs Eye

A What inspired me to do Silent Sky was the people who put together the last production PERIOD So I really hope studentled theater will continue and give Mudders opportunities in the arts where we may not have the opportunity to participate at the other Claremont Colleges PERIOD

Q In one sentence tell Mudders why they should go see products such as Silent Sky. a Come see what talents your friends have to offer",Harvey Mudd Theater Presents: Silent Sky â€“ The Muddraker,Harvey Mudd College
