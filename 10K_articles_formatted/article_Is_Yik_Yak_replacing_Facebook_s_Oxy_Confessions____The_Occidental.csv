The latest app to take the Occidental student body by storm has everybody yakkin Yik Yak an anonymous online message board that showcases usersubmitted posts in a realtime live stream has taken campus by storm PERIOD The app curates Yaks by showing only posts written within a mile and a half radius of the user PERIOD For Occidental students this distance encompasses all  acres of campus and much of the surrounding Eagle Rock neighborhood PERIOD

Yik Yaks growing popularity with the student body places it in direct opposition to Oxy Confessions a popular Facebook page that similarly allows users to submit anonymous messages PERIOD There have been several posts on both platforms arguing which is better than the other PERIOD Although Oxy Confessions has been around longer Yik Yaks many innovative features give it a clear leg up over its competition PERIOD

Unlike Facebook which only has a like button Yik Yak gives users the option to vote either up or down on posts PERIOD This functions as the apps filtering system if a post is popular it goes onto the Hot page where the best posts are sorted by number of votes PERIOD On the other hand if a post receives a score of negative five it is deleted from the app entirely PERIOD

Yik Yak also has a builtin sharing feature designed for optimal social media integration PERIOD Clicking the share button automatically generates a memelike image of any Yak that can then be shared on any social media platform and streamlines the ability for a post to go viral PERIOD

One aspect of Oxy Confessions that has remained largely absent from  Yik Yak has been the ability to facilitate intellectual dialogue PERIOD The  political philosophical and sociological discussions present in many  comments on Oxy Confessions arent maintainable on Yik Yak due to its   character limit PERIOD

Yik Yak naysayers however are quick to point out the divide in user populations between the two platforms PERIOD While Oxy Confessions holds and always will hold a special place in the hearts of upperclassmen Yik Yak is the medium of choice for new students PERIOD Posts about touching the gross Braun shower curtains and the trials of writing the most recent CSP paper abound on Yik Yak PERIOD Oxy Confessions still largely references the concerns of returning students such as forging signatures on graduation applications and anger at the Cooler ending its pizza delivery service PERIOD

I initially abhorred Yik Yak and its firstyearcentric posts PERIOD I even made a Facebook post about it with the hashtag TeamOxyConfessions to show my allegiance to the webpage PERIOD But over time I found myself checking Yik Yak more and more PERIOD The apps realtime updating feature allowed for immediate gratification with new content appearing at a moments notice PERIOD This contrasts sharply with Oxy Confessions which abides by a strict onceaday schedule PERIOD

Today I would consider myself a fullfledged Yik Yak convert PERIOD The posts I have seen on the app eclipse those on Oxy Confessions both in quantity and quality PERIOD Does this mean the end of Oxy Confessions is nigh  Nothe two mediums can exist simultaneously PERIOD Whether youre TeamYikYak or TeamOxyConfessions I think we can all agree that college is much more interesting since these platforms came into our lives PERIOD
