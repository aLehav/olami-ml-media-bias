I have a gift suggestion and I know its something that Ive been harping on but I want a live panther for the football games Board member Alex Murdoch said PERIOD People would go nuts PERIOD If anyone is interested in this and wants to help out let me know. this proposal came at Tuesday nights SGB public meeting in Nordys place where Board President James Landreneau announced that the Board has been discussing bringing a gift to campus PERIOD He said to about  people in the audience that the Board  responsible for distributing funds from the more than  million Student Activities Fund  will be looking for gift suggestions and student support if the initiative is to move forward PERIOD Previous gifts from the Board include The Tree of Knowledge sculpture in the WPU PERIOD

SGB also discussed campus safety and student awareness at the meeting starting with Board member Megan McGrath who gave a shout out to the Pitt and City of Pittsburgh police departments PERIOD

I had a really scary incident in my house over the weekend but the police were super nice and made me and my roommates feel extremely safe she said PERIOD I know we were thankful for them last spring during the bomb threats but its also really nice to know that they are around for us daytoday. board member Natalie Rothenberger reported that she rode the 30C with Transportation and Safety Committee Chairman Richard White on Monday night to gain a better understanding of the routes PERIOD Encouraging students to use the 30C as well as Safe Rider when necessary Rothenberger said she is continuing to discuss safety throughout South Oakland and is working on improving the current situation PERIOD

Community Outreach Chairwoman Mary Mallampalli stressed the importance of student involvement in the community PERIOD She said that while Pitt Make A Difference Day  which will take place on Oct PERIOD  and involve students helping clean Pittsburgh communities  registration is currently closed students can still participate in campus community service PERIOD

One such event Mallampalli talked about was the Sleepin For The Homeless event on Oct PERIOD  which includes a walkthrough of Downtown and provides valuable information on how to combat homelessness PERIOD The event will provide students with five to six community service hours PERIOD
