The Grand Valley State University football team had any of its potentialpostseason aspirations shattered Saturday after falling  at Michigan Technological University PERIOD Michigan Tech improves to  with the win GVSU falls to  PERIOD

The playoffs are over said GVSU coach Matt Mitchell PERIOD All that stuff is dead in the water PERIOD At this point it becomes about our senior class and maintaining the tradition of Grand Valley football trying to finish things out in the way that we should based on the culture of our program. the programs last fourloss season came in  when Brian Kellys Lakers finished  PERIOD All four of GVSUs losses this year have been against ranked opponents PERIOD

On Saturday the Lakers struggled from the getgo against their GLIAC North counterparts PERIOD

After GVSU sent the ball out of bounds on the opening kickoff Michigan Tech grabbed the momentum and didnt look back PERIOD Quarterback Tyler Scarlett led the Huskies down the field and capped the drive with a 6yard touchdown throw to wide receiverAndrew Clark PERIOD

Clark made it  later in the first quarter by hauling in a 38yard bubble pass from wideoutBrandon Cowie after GVSU turned the ball over on downs at Michigan Techs 17yard line PERIOD

The disastrous start continued for the Lakers on their next drive as quarterback Heath Parlings pass was intercepted by Michigan Techs DeShawn Nelson PERIOD Senior running back Charlie Leffingwell ripped off a 54yard touchdown run one play later giving the Huskies a  lead with eight seconds to play in the first quarter PERIOD

Id have to put it on our defense Mitchell said PERIOD We were back on our heels we werent as aggressive as we have been PERIOD We werent running around with the same enthusiasm as we had in the previous game. leffingwell scored again on Michigan Techs next drive hauling in a 20yard touchdown catch from Scarlett who added a 9yard rushing touchdown shortly thereafter to make it  at the  mark in the second quarter PERIOD

The Huskies finished with  total yards of offense in the game PERIOD Leffingwell rumbled for  yards on  carries while Scarlett completed 15of22 throws for  yards two touchdowns and no interceptions PERIOD

GVSU outscored Michigan Tech  in the second half but it proved to be too little too late PERIOD Both touchdowns came from Parling who completed 19of35 attempts for  yards two touchdowns and one pick PERIOD

The Lakers hitthe field next onSaturday at the University of Findlay PERIOD
