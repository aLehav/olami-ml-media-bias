Fridays Vanguard featuring stories on recent war protests was interesting but may have left out several important points PERIOD As a grad student who wrote the no firststrike war in Iraq resolution which passed ASPSU student senate on Martin Luther Kings actual birthday  by a vote of  to  with  abstentions which was submitted to the senate by PSU Progressive Student Union I believe it is particularly important to address what corporatemedia critic Noam Chomsky has called concision that is ways that media coverage minimizes and obscures fundamental issues while appearing to somehow cover an issue from a trendy or nice graphics USA Today model motif PERIOD

In terms of economics I didnt see the word oil in your protest issue yet this was the primary reason for the last two wars against Iraq by the U.S PERIOD There may be  points of Portland prowar political propaganda that is saturation coverage of some aspects of the war but for local city and PSU campus media there does seem to be an omission in terms of context PERIOD For example there is a boycott of Exxon to protest the Bush Administrations prowar stance in the world PERIOD

As the founding publisher and editor of the PSU Rearguard when I attended PSU during the first Gulf War I am glad to see groups like Students for Unity join Progressive Student Union and other activist groups in urging PSUs 150000ayear president Dan Bernstine to kick ROTC offcampus PERIOD Students from PSU Progressive Student Union for example met twice with the Oregonians editorial board to protest that bodys support for the war and for Bush yet when Medea Benjamin founding director of San Franciscos Global Exchange went with us last fall to talk to the Oregonian editors much less when Medea talked to  people in the Smith ballroom the night before there was no coverage by any of our PSU campus media that Medea was even at PSU in terms of news coverage PERIOD She had just gotten back from Afghanistan and Iraq and was the Green Partys California U.S PERIOD Senate candidate in the last election PERIOD

Concision to be sure PERIOD

Where has PSU print campus media been this year anyway The Republicansplattered Spectator of course is for war and for capitalism unapologetically with  of our student fee money to publicize their views PERIOD But the Rearguard seems to have been largely Missing In Action during the course of this year with infrequent issues PERIOD

As for the socalled Vanguard Progressive Student Union asked Vanguard Editor Erin Lloyd to endorse the big Portland peace rallies back in September  but Ms PERIOD Lloyd explained that the Vanguard doesnt endorse things per se PERIOD This evidently changed when the Vanguard endorsed Tracy Earll who sought reelection as SFC chair so far unsuccessfully after the SFC defunded OSPIRG this year PERIOD The Vanguard still seems to be supporting Earlls reelection after the election challenging the writein victory of a woman student of color in that election PERIOD

City media of course is all about yellow ribbons and flag waving genuflections PERIOD

The Oregonian even claimed falsely in a story that no public college student governments had opposed the Iraq War PERIOD Since I wrote the peace resolution which passed ASPSU in January I know that to be patently false PERIOD We sent the Oregonian a correction but they refused to print it PERIOD
