Portland is likely going to experience one of the closest and most divisive elections for mayor in its history PERIOD

Incumbent Mayor Ted Wheeler is facing a difficult bid for reelection under criticism from both the left and right for his handling of the citys Black Lives Matter protests PERIOD If reelected he would be the first Portland mayor since Vera Katz who left office in  to serve more than a single term PERIOD He has two serious challengers further to his left public policy advisor Sarah Iannarone and antipolice brutality activist Teressa Raiford who is running an entirely writein campaign PERIOD Neither Iannarone nor Raiford has ever held public office before PERIOD

A poll conducted by Davis Hibbitts and Midghall Research in midSeptember showed Iannarone leading Wheeler by  percentage points while an early October poll from the same source showed Iannarone and Wheeler nearly tied with Raiford a distant third PERIOD Despite the groundswell of antiWheeler sentiment visible in protests and lawn signs across the city Associate Professor of Political Science and Department Chair Ellen Seljan believes that Wheeler will win reelection PERIOD

Theres a lot of people voting because they are excited to vote in the presidential race Seljan said PERIOD But theyre going to vote for mayor as well even though they might not know as much about the candidates and in any sort of lowinformation environment the incumbent is the favorite. seljan points to the sizable margins of undecided voters  in the most recent poll as evidence that many voters are unfamiliar with the candidates PERIOD Seljan said Wheeler has greater name recognition due to being the incumbent and undecided voters are likely to vote for candidates whose names they know PERIOD

No matter who wins their power will be limited due to Portlands unique system of city government PERIOD Most major American cities have a mayorcouncil form of government in which an executive mayor presides over a city council with each council member elected to represent a single district of the city PERIOD Portland however has what is known as a commission government a system Seljan calls highly unusual. the fivemember city commission of which the mayor is one of the members is elected atlarge by the entire city instead of each commissioner having a constituency of a few neighborhoods as a city councilor would PERIOD The mayor has very little power beyond that of the other commissioners PERIOD

The consequences of commission government are wideranging according to Seljan PERIOD One of the biggest is Portlands recent string of oneterm mayors PERIOD The three previous mayors before Wheeler declined to run for reelection which Seljan attributes to the difficulty of advancing change through the commission government PERIOD

The mayor is seen as the most important political actor but they dont have the political power to back it up Seljan said PERIOD And so you need to spend a lot of time building coalitions and building consensus which is very challenging and makes it easy to get blamed along the way. many have blamed the commission system for the lack of officials of color in Portlands government PERIOD Because the commissioners are elected atlarge minority neighborhoods do not have city councilors to directly represent them resulting in a commission that only represents the needs and interests of the citys white majority PERIOD To date City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty the only Black commissioner and the nonprofit City Club of Portland have advocated for the commission system to be replaced while Wheeler has suggested a referendum on adopting a new system PERIOD

Iannarone and Raiford have also voiced criticism regarding the commission government PERIOD On her campaign website Iannarone writes that Our city works best when those making decisions reflect the experiences of the people whose lives theyre affecting in support of amending the city charter akin to a municipal constitution to reform the commission system PERIOD

Absentee voting should be offered in future elections
