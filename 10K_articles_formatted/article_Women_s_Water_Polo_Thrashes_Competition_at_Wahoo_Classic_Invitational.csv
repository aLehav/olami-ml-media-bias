The Georgetown womens club water polo team toppled the University of Virginia  for the programs first ever victory against the Cavaliers PERIOD

The Sept PERIOD  landmark win headlined the teams  performance at the Wahoo Classic Invitational in Charlottesville Va. at which the Hoyas crushed James Madison University  and cruised by the University of North Carolina  PERIOD

Georgetown water polo which was strictly an exhibition club until the  season wasted no time getting its second official campaign off the ground after making the journey down Highway  to Charlottesville PERIOD Saturdays threematch slate opened with a contest against the JMU Dukes and by the time the first quarter wrapped up the Hoyas held a  lead PERIOD

In a virtual interview with The Hoya sophomore team captain Madeline Hartigan said the team needed to rebuild its chemistry and camaraderie going into this season PERIOD

Slowing it down and setting up the full frontcourt making the passes making the drives and the turns and the picks to get open on a good offensive move was really what we focused on Hartigan said PERIOD JMU was Lets learn how to play together again PERIOD Lets get back in the groove. following the mornings 11goal triumph there was little doubt that the Hoyas had rediscovered their rhythm PERIOD The young selfguided group  with a roster composed primarily of underclassmen and returning players handling all coaching duties  turned their focus to the host Cavaliers with fresh memories of last Springs  defeat PERIOD



However it quickly became clear that this Georgetown squad would not meet last years fate PERIOD

After clawing their way to a narrow  advantage at halftime the Hoyas put the game out of reach with a flurry of three goals over the span of four and a half minutes in the third quarter to grow the lead to four PERIOD Virginia was not able to generate a response PERIOD By the end of the game Georgetowns highest scorer firstyear Olivia Semien singlehandedly matched the Cavaliers three goals PERIOD

Sophomore captain Noriko OShea said the match is a new peak for the Hoya program PERIOD

Everyone was working harder than I think weve ever played before OShea told The Hoya in a Zoom interview PERIOD I think everything just fell really nicely into place with how we communicated how we functioned as a team. the Hoyas defensive effort was anchored by graduate transfer goalie Hannah Hill who brings years of water polo experience to the team from the University of California Berkeley PERIOD OShea said Hills veteran presence helped stabilize Georgetowns performance on gameday PERIOD

Towards the end of the tournament she ended up taking on kind of a coaching role OShea said PERIOD Her maturity really just helped us to settle and take a breath and rethink how we were playing. georgetowns final victory of the tournament occurred Sept PERIOD  when the Hoyas overwhelmed the Tar Heels from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  with sophomore Rachael Jenar scoring  goals PERIOD Jenar would go on to finish with  goals throughout the weekend forming a group of  topscorers alongside sophomore Adora Zheng who also scored  goals and Semien and firstyear Lindsay Machado both of whom recorded  PERIOD

The Hoyas only loss at the invitational came against a local Washington D.C PERIOD womens Masters team the Washington DSeahorses PERIOD Even though the DSeahorses opened with an insurmountable first half lead Georgetown matched their efforts  in the third quarter despite five different players scoring however the team ultimately lost  PERIOD

Hartigan said competing against a more experienced opponent allowed for learning opportunities especially in drawing kickouts which are fouls where the offender is excluded from play for  seconds PERIOD

Learning how to draw kickouts from them was really good Hartigan said PERIOD Learning those techniques to use them on other teams is really helpful. georgetown will sharpen another facet of the game shooting fundamentals through a scheduled joint practice with the DSeahorses PERIOD More competitively the program is looking to arrange matchups with Beltway rivals George Washington University and the University of Maryland before getting another look at the DSeahorses when the club hosts a tournament in November PERIOD
