Bob Inglis explains how both parties should come together on climate change during the EnCourage event on Wednesday Sept PERIOD   in the Nebraska Union Auditorium in Lincoln Nebraska PERIOD

Climate change will never be fixed without the help of American conservatives former South Carolina Rep PERIOD Bob Inglis said at the University of NebraskaLincoln during an event hosted by republicEn on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

A viable climate change solution cannot be achieved by one party alone Inglis said at the Nebraska Union PERIOD The volatile nature of health care in the U.S PERIOD is representative of that fact he said PERIOD

Conservatives and liberals must reach an agreement on a longterm solution to climate change and to do that conservatives minds must be changed Inglis said PERIOD

To achieve this goal Inglis started republicEn a conservative organization that believes climate change is quantifiable and seeks to destigmatize the issue among conservative groups and seeks practical legislative solutions PERIOD

According to Inglis conservative members of Congress are too afraid to come out and support climate change solutions because they fear being kicked out of office by their constituents PERIOD

Human beings need the protection of the whole tribe Inglis said PERIOD We are herd animals and we want to be with other people PERIOD We are out to prove that you are not alone if you are a conservative and believe in climate change. inglis said he too was a vocal critic of climate change when he was in Congress in the early 2000s PERIOD

I said climate change was nonsense he said PERIOD I didnt know anything about it but only that Al Gore was for it PERIOD I represented a very red district PERIOD For six years I said climate change was nonsense PERIOD I admit now that it was very ignorant to dismiss it because Al Gore was for it. inglis said he only decided to reconsider his position on climate change when his son approached him and asked him to reconsider his opinion PERIOD

My son came to me and said he would vote for me but I had to clean up my act on the environment he said PERIOD He was saying I love you but you need to be better than before. inglis said he started his own research and began talking to experts around the nation PERIOD While in Congress Inglis had the opportunity to travel to Antarctica and visit scientists studying climate change in person where he became convinced climate change is real PERIOD

Inglis said he was inspired to create a bipartisan solution to climate change and he proposed the Raise Wages Cut Carbon Act of  PERIOD

Note to self do not introduce a carbon tax amidst the Great Recession in the reddest district in the reddest state in the nation he said PERIOD It did not go well at all. after  years in Congress Inglis said he lost during his primary race for not being conservative enough for his constituents PERIOD

Inglis started republicEn shorty after losing reelection to change the mindsets of conservatives around the nation and prove to Congress there are many Republicans who support climate change solutions PERIOD

According to Inglis the nation must come together to solve the problems of climate change PERIOD He said he imagines what it is like looking down on Earth as an astronaut and realizing how humans share the world and are responsible for each others decisions PERIOD

When you are in space you look all around and there is just this one blue dot where we know we can live he said PERIOD So its really sort of a spiritual experience for astronauts to realize how

much we are really in this together PERIOD In this one little spot we are literally all in this together. the UNL College Republicans refrained from participating in the event and released a statement on their Facebook page stating why PERIOD

RepublicEN never once contacted the UNL College Republican Executive Team about the organizations purpose marketing strategy and much more the statement read PERIOD We will not support an event or an organization that has ulterior motives for our membership. newsdailynebraskan.com
