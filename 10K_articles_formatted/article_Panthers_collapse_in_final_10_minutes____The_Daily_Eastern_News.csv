Eastern womens basketball team played  solid minutes of basketball before falling on the road  to Austin Peay Monday night PERIOD



The sad part is this was not a 20point ball game but thats all anybody will see Panthers head coach Linda Wunder said PERIOD

The Governors   were the preseason favorite to win the Ohio Valley Conference this season but were without OVC preseason Player of the Year Brooke Armistead due to a concussion PERIOD Monday night marked the first collegiate game that Armistead ever missed in her four year career PERIOD

Austin Peay guard Cassandra Peek stepped up to provide a career and game high  points in  minutes PERIOD

We werent mentally tough enough to keep the other team from scoring Wunder said PERIOD

The Colonels struggled to seperate themselves early from the Panthers   and went into halftime with a  lead

However the Panthers were struggling to rebound in the first half and failed to take care of the basketball throughout the game PERIOD

Of our four perimeter players not one had a single offensive rebound Wunder said PERIOD We had a stretch of too many turnovers in the second half. with  minutes left in the game Eastern was able to tie the game but then had consecutive breakdowns on offense that gave the Governors momentum PERIOD

I thought we did some good things in the second half but then we turned the ball over on three of our next four possesions Wunder said PERIOD

The Panthers came out of the locker room and hit five of their first seven shots to close the gap PERIOD However the Panthers went incredibly cold the rest of the evening by hitting only five of last their  shots PERIOD

When we got behind we took some bad shots and forced some things Wunder said PERIOD

Lauren Dailey led the Panthers in scoring with  points but had a disappointing evening leading the offense by committing five of the Panthers  turnovers PERIOD Panthers freshman guard Megan Sparks had an off night earning only eight points on 3of12 shooting PERIOD

The second half woes hit every Panther with Easterns shooting percentage dropping from  to  percent PERIOD Also the Panthers were three of four from beyond the arc in the opening twenty minutes but missed all six attempts in the final frame PERIOD
