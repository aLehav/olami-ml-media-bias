9419,2023-11-04,"new Yorks Aquila Theatre Company will bring the comedy and romance from William Shakespeare down to the Columbia Theatre for The Tempest next weekend PERIOD Courtesy of Lois Greenfield



Audiences should prepare themselves for comedy romance and more than a little magic as William Shakespeares The Tempest makes its way onto the Columbia Theatre stage PERIOD

The performance will take place at the Columbia Theatre this Saturday at  p.m PERIOD

The production will be put on by the New Yorkbased Aquila Theatre Company PERIOD The company aims to bring theatrical works to as many people as possible by touring the United States and participating in international theater festivals PERIOD They have received praise for the technical prowess of their cast and crew members as well as for making older material accessible to twenty-first century audiences PERIOD

The Aquila Company is no stranger to the Columbia stage but The Tempest will be the first Shakespearean production put on at the Columbia in years PERIOD

There were two reasons for bringing them to the Columbia said Roy Blackwood interim director of the Columbia Theatre PERIOD First were familiar with the crew PERIOD Theyve come down here before to do previous shows at the Columbia PERIOD Secondly I was interested in bringing a Shakespeare production down here PERIOD We have not had one of his plays put on here in a long while and The Tempest was the one they were offering. the Tempest considered by most to be Shakespeares final play is the story of the duke turned wizard Prospero whose usurping brother had banished him from his home land of Milan along with his daughter Miranda PERIOD They escape to an enchanted island which Prospero takes from the creature Caliban PERIOD Now years later he uses sorcery and the service of the wind spirit Ariel to whip up a sea storm marooning those who had wronged him in the first stage of a vengeful plan PERIOD However Miranda falls in love with Prince Ferdinand the son of one of Prosperos enemies PERIOD Also the embittered Caliban is willing to team up with some of the stranded men to destroy the wizard PERIOD

Blackwood admires the flexibility and professionalism of the Aquila Theatre PERIOD

The Aquila Theatre company is very mobile said Blackwood PERIOD Theyre not like Broadway where they stay in one place PERIOD Their mobility is what makes them adaptable PERIOD They also bring full sets and fabulous costumes with them it will be a great experience for audiences. it is not uncommon for people to be reluctant about Elizabethan drama PERIOD When read on the page the language can confuse modern readers PERIOD However Blackwood thinks even those who do not consider themselves fans of the Bard will find much to enjoy in the Aquilas modern vision of an old favorite PERIOD

The contemporary twist in their production keeps the material fresh said Blackwood PERIOD I think people will be responsive toward that PERIOD Thats the beauty of Shakespeare no matter what time period you set it in it still works. for more information on the Aquila Theatre Company visit their website at aquilatheatre.com PERIOD To get tickets visit columbiatheatre.org PERIOD
