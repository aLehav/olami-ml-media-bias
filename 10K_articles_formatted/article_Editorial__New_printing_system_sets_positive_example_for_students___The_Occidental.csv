Last semester senior art major Auddie Benavides spent seven days gathering excess paper from each printer in the Academic Commons as part of an art project PERIOD At weeks end she displayed the seven pilesnone less than a foot tallat the buildings entrance for everyone to see PERIOD The display was a shocking visual representation of just how much waste  pressured and preoccupied college students can produce PERIOD ITS new printing system which requires the swipe of an identification card in order to complete print requests is the first step toward efficiently mitigating students irresponsible printing habits PERIOD

Despite the systems sustainable qualities and its userfriendly interface complaints about it dominate the suggestion boards posted by ITS near each printer PERIOD For a student body that voted to donate  of each students tuition to a Sustainability Fund boasts Urban and Environmental Policy as one of its largest majors and is readily aware of the colleges lessthanstellar carbon footprint it is inconsistent to complain about an administrative initiative that reduces waste at no cost to students PERIOD

The swipe process requires a negligible amount of effort PERIOD The additional moment one might spend printing are not legitimate grounds for complaint PERIOD If Occidental students cannot organize and practice this very minimal form of activism then they cannot claim to hold concerns about the environment or living progressively PERIOD

We should applaud James Urhich and the ITS staff for bringing this system to campus PERIOD It is exactly the type of initiative that Occidental should pursue a small relatively cheap program that does not require tuition hikes or a blow to the endowment but manages to improve the state of the college PERIOD The ripple effects of the new printing system will reach many areas of life at Occidental and it will surely not go unnoticed by the representatives from the College Sustainability Report Card when they visit campus next year PERIOD

At Occidental sustainability is a constant topic of conversation but it is time that we close the gap between what we practice and what we preach PERIOD Thanks to ITS the first step has been taken for us PERIOD Perhaps now we might pay more attention to where we throw away our rubbish how much time we spend in the shower and whether or not we drive to the Cooler PERIOD



This editorial represents the collective opinion of the Occidental Weekly Editorial Board PERIOD Each week the Editorial Board will publish its viewpoint on a matter relevant to the Occidental community PERIOD
