9961,2021-05-13,"queens College conducted its annual student government and clubs election this April and the results are in PERIOD While congratulations are in order for the elected officials for the  academic year there was a loss of  votes from the club elections PERIOD

From April eleventh to April twenty-second QC students had the opportunity to vote for club leaders as well as student government officials for the  academic year PERIOD Emails were sent out to students Qmail accounts with a link to follow for them to cast their votes PERIOD

QCs student government is an organization that bridges the gap between student needs and QC administration PERIOD Some things that the Academic Senate discusses are technology on campus budgeting academic ideas or concerns and student life PERIOD Apart from daytoday activities the Academic Senate is responsible for CreditNo Credit policies PERIOD

For the  academic year election all students were given the opportunity to cast their ballots PERIOD Thats approximately  students based on the Office of Institutional Effectiveness data on student enrollment statistics  are undergraduate students while  are graduate students PERIOD The Knight News reached out to the Student Election Review Committee SERC for their comment on this years election results and the loss of the  votes PERIOD The results for the current election will be made public during the Senate meeting on May thirteenth PERIOD Since the results are not available to the public yet they cannot be compared to previous elections results to see where the loss in votes occurred PERIOD

According to the SERC  students did not initially have access to the correct ballot PERIOD The situation was later rectified PERIOD The correct ballot was made available to students and they were contacted via email by the Office of Student Development and Leadership encouraging them to recast their votes PERIOD Could it be that out of these  students only  students recast their votes The students who were encouraged to recast their ballots probably did not do so perhaps they forgot about it or the email got buried in their inbox PERIOD This would explain the loss of the  votes PERIOD

When asked about how the pandemic affected the election the SERC mentioned that this was not pandemicrelated PERIOD The Queens College student body traditionally has very strong voter turnout PERIOD A virtual environment did pose challenges among them was the lack of opportunity for inperson campaigning. campaigning for the election proved difficult for the candidates because of distance learning and the campus being closed to students who were not authorized to be there PERIOD Candidates were unable to inform the general student population about their campaign themselves and the platform that they are running they were also unable to stop students and get them to vote on the spot ensuring that every student was casting their ballots PERIOD

Going forward the SERC plans to make every effort to perform early ballot testing and address ways to engage the student body more effectively under any continuing COVID19impacted learning situations PERIOD
