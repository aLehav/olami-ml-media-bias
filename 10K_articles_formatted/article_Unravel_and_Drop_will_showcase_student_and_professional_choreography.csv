I want people to be engaged and have some sort of opinion about what they see Trigg said PERIOD I dont want nondancers to just come and view the show PERIOD I want them to get something out of it PERIOD I tried to make my piece about art rather than entertainment. trigg also said that two of the pieces will be performed on a set which is unusual for a dance concert PERIOD
