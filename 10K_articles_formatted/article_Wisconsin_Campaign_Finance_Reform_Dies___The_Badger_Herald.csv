2791,2004-03-05,"campaign finance reform will be delayed in Wisconsin upon Sen PERIOD Mike Elliss RNeenah announcement Thursday that killed legislation calling for changes in the way Wisconsin campaigns are financed PERIOD

The announcement comes only days after a controversial compromise seemed to position the legislation named Senate Bill  for possible consideration in this session of the Senate which ends March  PERIOD Instead efforts at reform will now wait until the  session PERIOD

At this time we feel killing the bill is the best thing to do said Jay Heck executive director of the State Governing Board of Common Cause In Wisconsin which backed the compromise PERIOD Speaker John Gard was against it Senate Majority leader Mary Panzer was not going to schedule it and Gov PERIOD Doyle just isnt interested in campaign finance reform. for many proponents of campaign finance the most controversial part of Elliss bill was the absence of a stipulation requiring disclosure and regulation of soft money contributions used in influencing elections PERIOD The U.S PERIOD Supreme Court ruled last year such contributions must be disclosed in federal elections and several states such as Illinois have since required full disclosure in state elections PERIOD

While the original Senate Bill  required full disclosure of all special interest donors the revised version did not include the provision due to fears the Republicanled Legislature would not consider the bill if it remained PERIOD

The change led to the withdrawal of support by both Sen PERIOD Jon Erpenbach DMiddleton who cosponsored the original bill along with Ellis and the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign a key advocate of the original bill PERIOD

All you need to know about the new version is that the wealthiest special interests love it said Mike McCabe executive director of the WDC adding  million of soft money went undisclosed in the  state elections PERIOD They were scared to death of the original PERIOD The new bill allows huge dollars to fly under the radar which isnt right because voters have a right to know whos putting money where. the way campaigns are financed has come under increased scrutiny in Wisconsin in the wake of scandals of  involving several legislators most notably former Senate Majority leader Chuck Chvala and former Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen PERIOD

The lawmakers were charged with illegal campaign fundraising including the use of paid staffers to work on reelection campaigns and misconduct in office PERIOD

The original bill was a direct response to those scandals McCabe said adding the new version did nothing to prevent such occurrences in the future PERIOD

Although Common Cause had also fought for full disclosure the group felt the bill which included a ban on fundraising at budget time and the creation of a Public Integrity Endowment to provide additional public funding for candidates was acceptable without that provision PERIOD

For now Common Cause looks to continuing the fight for reform next legislative session PERIOD

It was nave to think we could get this scheduled in the last week of the session in an election year Heck said PERIOD In the fall the first trials from the scandals will begin and then I think well have an atmosphere conductive to getting reform legislation scheduled. this article was published Mar   at  am and last
