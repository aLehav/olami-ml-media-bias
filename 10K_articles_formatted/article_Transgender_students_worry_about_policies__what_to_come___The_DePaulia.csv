Rallies and protests supporting transgender youth have happened around the country since President Donald Trump issued a dear colleague letter Feb PERIOD  that stated that his administration would roll back Obamaera guidelines to protect transgender students PERIOD These guidelines included allowing trans students to use the bathroom of their gender identity PERIOD

Elon Sloan who is a nonbinary trans person and uses the pronouns theythemtheirs said that Trumps move eliminates a federal framework and guidelines for schools but doesnt change the fact that trans students are still protected because of Title IX PERIOD

Title IX is a federal law that makes it illegal for schools that receive federal funding to discriminate based on sex PERIOD Though it doesnt specifically talk about every situation where discrimination may happen it provides some guidelines as to what these situations may look like and how schools might respond according to the National Center for Transgender Equality NCTE PERIOD

Even though these guiding principles have been revoked that doesnt change the fact that schools have to treat students according to their gender identity including restroom and locker room access but it may mean that the Department of Education wont help in cases of discrimination  though students can still go to court to defend their rights NCTE said PERIOD

Schools Sloan said should have their own guidelines on Title IX PERIOD Sloan said that DePaul like many other institutions fails its trans students and could do more in the future to help PERIOD

The conversation about Title IX is much bigger PERIOD Schools should have their own guidelines about Title IX not empty shows of solidarity PERIOD Schools have to be realistic about the environment we offer Sloan said PERIOD This is a marker of things to come in the future PERIOD Realistically institutions that want to be allies will think about how they are supporting that desire. in response to Trumps letter DePaul and other universities issued statements stating they will support trans students on their campuses and will not follow Trumps guidelines PERIOD

In DePauls statement which was signed by Provost Marten denBoer and Vice President for Student Affairs Eugene Zdziarski they said the changes will have no effect at DePaul and procedures to support our transgender students in student records housing and facility use as well as in university resources such as LGBTQA Student Services  will continue. we will always ensure that we are doing everything we can to actively promote an inclusive environment for all students the statement said PERIOD We will take steps to respond to any concerns that arise. in a statement to the DePaulia the university expanded on its statement to the student body saying that Chicago municipal law requires that individuals be permitted to use sexsegregated facilities such as restrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity PERIOD DePaul has no plans to change its existing policies or procedures on this issue. sloan who is also an LGBTQA student advocate for LGBTQA Student Services said that LGBTQA Student Services did an assessment on the climate on campus and found that trans students who are nonbinary feel the worst about campus climate and also feel less safe on campus PERIOD To combat this they said institutions like DePaul would focus on educating faculty staff and students PERIOD

Its one thing to affirm pronouns and that trans students are on campus but we have to make sure that there are clear places for support Sloan said PERIOD Its hard to make sure thats available. the Student News Site of DePaul University","Transgender students worry about policies, what to come - The DePaulia",DePaul University
