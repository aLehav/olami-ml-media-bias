In an unprecedented move Disney has bumped up the release date for Avengers Infinity War. although seemingly harmless this move has repercussions for the industry beyond what one might originally think PERIOD

Instead of having to wait until May fourth to see the third Avengers film well all be able to file into the theaters on April  to see the superheroblockbuster PERIOD

This is a big deal even if were only talking about a matter of days here PERIOD Studios only change release dates when theres a specific reason or strategy when films are pushed back its usually a quality issue or because the studio has no faith in how itll perform at the box office but when theyre brought forward it could be a number of different reasons PERIOD Moving on a property as big as The Avengers especially when its supposed to be released in just a few months makes it even more remarkable PERIOD

Yet to deepen the mystery Disney hasnt released an official statement as to what exactly the reasoning for this move was PERIOD

Of course theres been plenty of online speculation as to what the reasoning could have been PERIOD One of the more popular theories has to do with the Han Solo standalone film Solo A Star Wars Story. in bumping up the release date of Avengers it gives the film a longer run at the boxoffice without any direct competition since Disney owns both Marvel and Lucasfilm PERIOD In short it means both films could wind up making more money in boxoffice receipts PERIOD

The press surrounding Solo has also been rather mixed  the movie is only couple months away and theyve only released one short trailer which along with a whole bunch of drama involving the films director that broke last summer has been leading people to believe the movie itself might not be very good qualitywise PERIOD

Other theories are that theyre simply trying to please their fans or remove any possibility of online spoilers as the film has been scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom on April  since the film was initially announced meaning the countries would share an opening weekend instead of a U.S PERIOD release a week later PERIOD

Whatever the reasoning may be bumping up a release date on a property as big as The Avengers has several other implications for the whole industry PERIOD

Other studios had deliberately scheduled their summer blockbusters around The Avengers as itd be foolish to compete with them headtohead PERIOD After all given that most of the blockbusters we see these days are superhero based anything that wanted to go up against The Avengers would be trying to attract the same audience which would only hurt both films box office PERIOD

Now Dwayne Johnsons blockbuster about a giant monkey fighting a giant alligator Rampage only has one week in theaters before Avengers comes steamrolling in PERIOD The Amy Schumer comedy I Feel Pretty and Paula Patton thriller Traffik virtually stand no chance to earn any money their opening weeks as theyre also scheduled to come out on April  PERIOD

Disney in a manner of speaking has more or less just declared war on other studios and the scary part is that Disney can most likely defeat each and every one of them PERIOD

Seeing how the company is buying off properties left and right  first Marvel then Lucasfilm and now twentieth Century Fox  theres seemingly no stopping the Mouse PERIOD They plan to go up against Netflix next year as theyre launching their own exclusive streaming service which is only going to drive out more competition PERIOD

Basically the industry is becoming more and more closed off as Disney repeatedly tries to dominate all other studios PERIOD The future implications of that could potentially run Hollywood into the ground should no one be able to compete with them PERIOD Eventually one way or another theres going to be some sort of radical change PERIOD

Dont let that scare you too much though  similar things happened around the 1960s when the Hollywood studio system collapsed and the Golden Age came to an end PERIOD Were simply seeing the business shift into something new which is a natural change PERIOD Theres no telling what the next step will be but rest assured that there still will be some sort of next step Id place my bets that its going to have to do with online streaming PERIOD

So for now we can just wait PERIOD Wait and watch of course because who are we kidding  were all going to go see Avengers Infinity War on April  PERIOD
