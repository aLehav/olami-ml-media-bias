Survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence and supporters march past Bryan Hall chanting Silence is not consent
during the Take Back the Night march Thursday evening PERIOD

JACKSON FERDERER Evergreen opinion editorOctober  

Take Back the Night the annual march to raise awareness for sexual assault and domestic violence which took place last Thursday blatantly lacked an important component men PERIOD Sure there were a few men in the crowd but the large majority of protesters were women PERIOD

Sexual assault cannot be stopped if it is pushed aside as merely a womens issue PERIOD Sexual assault and rape culture is a mens issue PERIOD

More than  percent of perpetrators are men according to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey PERIOD According to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network  percent of adult survivors are women PERIOD If we as a society are serious about stopping this epidemic men need to show up and not only support protests and marches like Take Back the Night but they need to integrate awareness into their everyday lives PERIOD

Sarah Sherrod secretary of YWCA at WSU said a great way for men to combat sexual assault is to speak to each other PERIOD

I would like to see men calling out other men and taking responsibility for their male counterparts Sherrod said PERIOD Id also just like to see more support for women and others who are fighting for these same issues. this means it is important for men to shut down rape jokes PERIOD It means men must recognize the complacency they have with a system that puts women into a state of fear just for walking alone at night PERIOD

This is what Take Back the Night was all about and is what Amy Sharp director of WSUs Womens Resource Center thinks men can help change PERIOD Sharp mentioned a story of a woman being sexually assaulted after stepping out for a cigarette at three in the morning PERIOD Sharp said her boyfriend at the time pointed out that women shouldnt have to live in a world where they fear going outside even if its in the middle of the night PERIOD

She should be able to smoke a cigarette at three in the morning and not have to worry about her safety Sharp said PERIOD That should not be something that every woman has to consider if she wants to go out and smoke or if she wants to get some fresh air or hell if she wants to go running at three in the morning PERIOD That should not be something that she has to always consider. rape culture is not just about the physical act but is instead a result of how our society treats women PERIOD Next time youre in class or hanging out with friends recognize how often men interrupt or speak over women PERIOD When you hear someone talk about sexual assault recognize how often it is blamed on the victim and then compare that to how often other crimes are blamed on the victim PERIOD Youll likely be surprised by the difference PERIOD

When we devalue women like this we end up devaluing them as people PERIOD This leads to objectification which itself could open the door to instances of rape PERIOD

Men can end sexual assault PERIOD Men can call out their friends when they hear a rape joke PERIOD Men can catch themselves when they talk over women PERIOD Most importantly men can listen to the experiences of women PERIOD

Be good listeners Sharp said PERIOD Be critical listeners about what youre being fed in the media PERIOD When rape jokes happen its easy to laugh and its hard to be uncomfortable PERIOD Be okay with the discomfort. jackson Ferderer is a senior English major from Vancouver PERIOD They are set to graduate in May  PERIOD
