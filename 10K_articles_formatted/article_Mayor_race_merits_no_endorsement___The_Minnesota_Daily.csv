5071,2023-11-04,"the lack of qualified alternatives to a preoccupied Rybak disappoints PERIOD

Published  November  

Last Thursday The Minnesota Daily Editorial Board endorsed Allen Kathir in the Ward  City Council race PERIOD Today we endorse Cam Gordon for Ward  and spend considerable space arguing against the ballot measure that would change our municipal government structure PERIOD With all these endorsements and the wider municipal elections coverage readers are probably wondering what the Editorial Boards position is on the Minneapolis mayoral race PERIOD R.T PERIOD Rybak may have been a fine mayor over the past eight years PERIOD He ensured a lightrailready replacement after the interstate 35W bridge collapsed he has balanced budgets and added  police officers to the department to be fair Rybak has failed to reign in an expensive lawsuit prone PD PERIOD R.T PERIOD Rybak endorsed by the DFL is so busy testing gubernatorial waters that we question whether he has enough time to do the other job hes campaigning for to serve as mayor of the city of Minneapolis PERIOD While the Daily Editorial Board would like to rebuke Rybak  who has attended more gubernatorial forums than mayoral ones this year  by endorsing one of his opponents none of the other candidates appear to have the experience necessary to do the job PERIOD John Kolstad is endorsed by the Minneapolis Republican and Independence parties but lacks government experience and name recognition like most of Rybaks opponents PERIOD The Daily Editorial Board would gladly endorse a strong campaign with grassroots activism or an incumbent who engages competition in the spirit of healthy democracy PERIOD Instead we are disappointed and simply endorse learning more about the candidates to make your own informed decision for mayor PERIOD
