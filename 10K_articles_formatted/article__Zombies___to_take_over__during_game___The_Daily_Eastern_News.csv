As if playing normal tag was not enough zombie tag is coming to Eastern PERIOD



Three students Madi Sibon Amanda Limbach and Frankie Jackson were sitting around one day and decided it would be fun to play a campuswide game of tag PERIOD

We didnt think too many people would join the Facebook event but now we have more than  people listed as attending Sibon said PERIOD

The game which will take place Friday from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m. will be played across campus and anyone can participate PERIOD

The gist of the game is if you are a zombie you want to tag people that are not zombies and if youre a survivor you basically want to stay away from zombies Sibon said PERIOD

She said the trio is still figuring out details of how the different roles will work but that zombie tag will be played outside PERIOD

We were going to use Nerf guns but we were told theyre illegal on campus she said PERIOD Well probably use water guns or marshmallows instead. sibon said she plans to talk to the Eastern Police Department this week to let them know the game will be going on PERIOD

Participants will be wearing different bandana colors PERIOD

Survivors will wear green bandanas and zombies will wear red ones PERIOD

She said zombies can tag people but for the tag to count it must be a twohand touch PERIOD

Everyone can run but we dont want people using excessive force and pushing people Sibon said PERIOD We want a relatively peaceful game and dont want anyone to get hurt. she said other rules include having to wait  minutes in place when zombie participants have been tagged with a fiveminute time period following when they cannot be tagged PERIOD

Safe zones will be in buildings such as dining halls and residence halls but anywhere outside on Easterns campus is fair game to participants wearing bandanas PERIOD

Its basically a game of catandmouse tag but with a zombie apocalypse Sibon said PERIOD
