5898,2023-07-11,"ahead of the Longhorns home opener against the Miners this Saturday The Daily Texan spoke with Michael Cuviello sports editor of UTEPs The Prospector PERIOD

The Daily Texan UTEP picked up its first win of the season last weekend against Stephen F PERIOD Austin PERIOD What in your opinion were some of the keys to the victory

Michael Cuviello I think one of the major keys was actually being able to get a running game going with redshirt freshman Deion Hankins PERIOD We didnt make a lot of mistakes like there was one interception PERIOD Pretty accurate passing PERIOD We got all our receivers set up pretty well in the passing game PERIOD  We just had a consistent effort but I think the key was getting the running game going with the amount of yards per carry that we were getting out of Deion Hankins PERIOD

DT What can you tell me about left guard Bobby DeHaro How do you think hell match up against the Texas defensive line

MC I think it will be a really good test for the guy PERIOD I mean hes done very good against Conference USA competition but when youre talking about University of Texas youre talking about four fivestar guys on the line PERIOD So I think its going to be a very tough assignment for him PERIOD I think hell put himself in well but it would be fools gold to expect that hes gonna be able to handle the front four of the Longhorns PERIOD

DT How do the players feel about already having one game under their belts

MC Well I think it was important to get the win PERIOD They struggled early on but they took control of the game in the second half PERIOD So I think theyve built up some confidence PERIOD They may be a little overconfident going into Texas but I dont think thats going to be the case PERIOD But I think for a team thats only won one game a year for the past couple years starting off the year with a win  theyve got a good amount of confidence PERIOD

DT Whats the COVID19 situation looking like on UTEPs end Do you know how UTEP players and staff have been adapting

MC Early when they started up practice they did have some COVID positives PERIOD At this moment they seem to be pretty clear of COVID PERIOD They did have one player that did not feel well last week but it wasnt COVIDrelated PERIOD So I think they dont feel too bad about the COVID situation but I think they have to take extra precautions so theyre somewhat not able to live the normal college life that most people live PERIOD

DT To your knowledge what is the attitude of players and coaches heading into this game Are they excited to play Texas

MC They went to Texas Tech not too long ago but going to Austin and playing in that stadium I think is one of the highlights for most of the players PERIOD The last time they went to Austin was in  which was not a joyous journey but nobody on this team was with that team PERIOD And just think less than four weeks ago they were down to eight or nine games so I think theyre pretty excited to go to play a Power Five team like Texas that is actually ranked PERIOD
