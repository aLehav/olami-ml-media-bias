he bands that were preMurder City Devils Area  Death Wish Kids and the Unabombers were the perfect soundtrack for my days as a teenage punk rocker stuck in a podunk town in Eastern Washington PERIOD Songs like  by Area   by the Death Wish Kids and  by the Unabombers were the theme songs that played in my car while I spent my days looking for dirt weed and someone to buy me beer while I lived in Richland PERIOD I was lucky to be exposed to such extremely hardcore music while I lived in out the middle of nowhere as there wasnt anybody in that area that was doing anything like it PERIOD

When the members of those bands to came together to form the Murder City Devils they did more than supply a outlet for teenage angst PERIOD They broke away from the standard  punk and the superbland pop punk of the early 90s and reminded people of punks roots PERIOD They refreshed the memories of punk rockers with their revival of the music first brought to us by Iggy Pop and Johnny Thunders PERIOD They reminded us that dancing was even more fun than beating the crap out of yourself while slamming in the pit PERIOD They emphasized that  was first 

Their first 7Dance Hall MusicBroken GlassEmpty Bottles Broken HeartsIn Name and Blood.Press GangIdle HandsThelema.In Name and Bloodwe are really tired of this and were releasing this to fulfill our contract with Sub Pop.punk rawk band even though it was the Tight Bros from Way Back When that inspired me PERIOD I have to thank them for that that was some good times PERIOD
