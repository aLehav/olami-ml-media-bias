Mandi Stirone  Tuesday September  

After cutting off service to all dorm phones this summer Saint Marys is responding to student complaints that cell phone service is unavailable in their rooms PERIOD

Students were required to disclose their cell numbers during room picks last spring though they could opt out from having their number listed on the directory PERIOD

Information Technology has requested student participation in a PRISM survey designed to locate problem areas said Sandy Handley telecommunications coordinator PERIOD

At this point the objective is to define the areas that there are problems in she said PERIOD We need to know where the difficulties lie for every carrier PERIOD  We are looking at all the options. no solution will be attempted until student input arrives so students are encouraged to participate she said PERIOD

We understand the difficulties that students are having with cell phone service and we would like to resolve those problems as quickly as possible she said PERIOD

Students seemed generally receptive to the new policy though not all reported trouble with their service PERIOD

I get really good service here actually said Megan Griffen a freshman who uses Verizon PERIOD

Still Griffen said she plans to fill out the survey PERIOD

I get a lot of dropped calls said freshman Katie Brown whose carrier is Sprint Nextel PERIOD

Brown said she had not filled out the survey but planned to soon PERIOD

Information Technology is also planning to oversee the removal of remaining dorm phones in the near future she said PERIOD While no phones are operational phone sets remain in rooms in LeMans and McCandless Halls Handley said PERIOD They will be removed around Christmas PERIOD

The only phones that will remain in dorms are those located in the hallways for emergency use she said PERIOD At least some students use the hall phones she said though she did not know the extent of their use PERIOD Staff will also continue to have phones in their offices PERIOD

Pauline Kistka a resident assistant in LeMans hall said that she has not had any problems with the phone being in the hallway PERIOD She has not received any complaints about nighttime calls and several girls in her hall have been using the phone PERIOD

She does miss having the landline though PERIOD

I actually appreciated the room phone she said PERIOD It was nice because I didnt have to use my cell phone. share This Story

Instead of calling friends and family to proclaim the news of a big win.. PERIOD
