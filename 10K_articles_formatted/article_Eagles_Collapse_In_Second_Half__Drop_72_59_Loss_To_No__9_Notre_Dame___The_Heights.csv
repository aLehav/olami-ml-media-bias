3676,2023-02-03,"before Boston College womens basketballs conference matchup against No PERIOD  Notre Dame in Conte Forum began the Eagles celebrated Black History Month donning warm up shirts that displayed the names of prominent Black figures who the Eagles look up to PERIOD

Using their platform and being able to use their voice in a productive way is super important BC head coach Joanna BernabeiMcNamee said PERIOD Anything where there can be a better call for justice if theyre able to do it I know they really take advantage of that opportunity. but in a game that meant more than basketball BC failed to defeat the Fighting Irish whowith a roster of six players standing over  feetproved to be too tall a task for the Eagles PERIOD BC   Atlantic Coast failed to capitalize on its 20point second quarter and collapsed in the second half en route to a  loss PERIOD Notre Dame   flourished in the transition game totaling  points in the paint in its road victory PERIOD

A stagnant first quarter led to a  Notre Dame lead with all four points coming from the free throw line PERIOD Fouls travels and outofbounds balls led to an underwhelming start from the Eagles PERIOD In under five minutes Notre Dame took a  lead using its height advantage to drive the ball and grab offensive rebounds PERIOD Notre Dame scored  points in the paint in the first quarter PERIOD

We really did want to do a better job blocking out but we didnt BernabeiMcNamee said PERIOD The one thing that faltered in this game today was our rebounding. a JoJo Lacey floater and Notre Dame turnover helped the Eagles regain speed PERIOD BC came within five but was hurt by ball handling mistakes and missed shots PERIOD The Eagles made zero shots on four attempts from beyond the arc in the first quarter PERIOD

We cant get stagnant offensively BernabeiMcNamee said PERIOD When we get a lead we have to value that possession and realize how important that is PERIOD We need to really just work the ball. the Eagles started the second quarter with four straight points PERIOD Lacey swished a jumper and Andrea Daley made two free throws to bring the score to  Fighting Irish PERIOD The games pace quickened and both teams thrived in transition but BC struggled to defend Notre Dames quick breakouts leading to six fastbreak points for Notre Dame in the first half PERIOD

The Eagles defensive struggles and minimal offensive rebounds put Notre Dame ahead by seven with two minutes left in the first half PERIOD Daley and TYana Todd hit backtoback 3pointers to bring the Eagles within four and Todd closed the gap to two heading into the break PERIOD BC outscored Notre Dame  in the second quarter but Notre Dame totaled  rebounds in the first half alone PERIOD

I saw patience in that second quarter BernabeiMcNamee said PERIOD I wish we could have just maintained that through the whole second half

Sonia Citron Notre Dames 6foot1 guard led the Fighting Irishs offense with  points PERIOD Citron along with Olivia Mileswho notched  pointsplayed fast in transition and attacked the rim PERIOD

Notre Dame scored six straight points to start the second half but after a quiet first half Taina Mair nailed a 3pointer to bring BC back into the game PERIOD With  to go in the third quarter Mair tied the game PERIOD BC continued to struggle against the height of the Fighting Irish though who reclaimed an eightpoint lead to end the quarter PERIOD

Needing baskets to drop BC came out with a renewed energy to start the fourth quarter PERIOD But whenever the Eagles got close Notre Dame pulled away PERIOD

With six minutes left the Irish had a 12point cushion PERIOD BC struggled to defend the arc and let up backtoback open Notre Dame 3pointers PERIOD Shots werent falling for BC and its deficit dropped to  points with  left to play PERIOD The gap proved too great to overcome handing the Eagles their first home loss to Notre Dame since  PERIOD

I think its a big improvement from the first time we played Notre Dame BernabeiMcNamee said PERIOD I still want to see more and I want us to grow up as fast as humanly possible because I think that we do have a dangerous team when were running on all cylinders. nEWS SPORTS ARTS MAGAZINE NEWTON OPINIONS MULTIMEDIA
