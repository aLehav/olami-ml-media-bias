The No PERIOD  Texas AM womens tennis team went into its spring break road trip to Las Vegas with plenty of confidence riding the crest of a sevenmatch win streak PERIOD However after almost two weeks without a victory against three highly ranked opponents the Aggies   Big  return home tonight to face the University of Oklahoma at the AM Tennis Center PERIOD

Beginning their twogame series hosted by the University of NevadaLas Vegas the Aggies were dealt their second shutout of the season falling  to the No PERIOD  Duke University Bluedevils on March  PERIOD In their next matchup the Aggies failed to secure the doubles point against No PERIOD  UNLV leading to a  AM loss PERIOD On Monday AM traveled to face No PERIOD  Georgia Tech and was downed  PERIOD

 said AM Head Coach Bobby Kleinecke PERIOD 

Coming out of their recent threegame slide the Aggies seem to have found a glaring weakness in their ability to win the doubles point PERIOD The Aggies do however boast a  record at home as they begin a sevenmatch home stand lasting until April  PERIOD

Ashley Hedberg the Aggies lone senior is looking forward to the challenge of the approaching homestand that will bring in a host of dangerous teams PERIOD

 she said PERIOD

The No PERIOD  Oklahoma University womens tennis team should certainly provide AM with a challenge PERIOD The Sooners   Big  are off to their best start since the  campaign and are fresh off a  win over No PERIOD  UTSan Antonio this past Tuesday PERIOD Oklahoma is led by senior Annette Bryntesson who owns a  record in singles play and is the most consistent player coming into tonights match PERIOD

The Sooners are equally potent in doubles play with the pairing of Anda Perianu and Heather Saluri who remain undefeated at No PERIOD  doubles and are ranked thirty-fourth in the nation PERIOD

The Sooners are now  versus ranked opponents this spring PERIOD The emphasis down the stretch for the Aggies will invariably be their ability to control their own fate by securing the evercrucial doubles point PERIOD

AM Assistant Coach Alison Ojeda said that in practicethey have been working on finding the right pairings to make sure they control doubles play PERIOD

 she said PERIOD 

The two Big  foes will take the court tonight at  p.m PERIOD at the Texas AM Tennis Center PERIOD
