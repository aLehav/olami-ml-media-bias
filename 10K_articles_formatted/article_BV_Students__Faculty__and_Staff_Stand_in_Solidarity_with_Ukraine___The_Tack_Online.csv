Thursday March twenty-fourth at  am members of the Buena Vista University community gathered by the Liberty Bell in peaceful protest to support Ukraine PERIOD As of today it was one month ago Russia invaded the country PERIOD Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked that the American populous take a few minutes to walk out onto their streets to show support for the Ukrainian people PERIOD

His plea was heard by those in Storm Lake Iowa PERIOD Marian Riner Assistant Professor of Social Work explains why she chose to participate

Part of one of the social work values is social justice PERIOD A lot of things are happening over in Ukraine that we need to be aware of advocating for and supporting I think a peaceful protest is a great way to bring awareness and show solidarity for individuals in Ukraine that are suffering and enduring such violent attacks. the protest was organized by the Dean of School of Liberal Arts and Professor of History Dixee BartholomewFeis and Dr PERIOD Andrea Frantz Professor of Digital Media PERIOD Frantz solidifies the importance of this demonstration

She BartholomewFeis and I have done a lot of talking about the invasion of Ukraine Were both horrified and want to be able to raise awareness about the needs first of all of the people in Ukraine whats going on there but also were interested in trying to raise awareness among Americans in terms of offering our support however we can Frantz went on to say This war is unjust it is immoral and I think the only way that we begin to grapple with that as Americans is if we talk about it

Other participants included a group of BV students PERIOD Among them was Brayden Bergum a junior social work major PERIOD

Today marks one month since you know Russia invaded Ukraine PERIOD Its a big humanitarian crisis the war there is unjust and you know any support counts PERIOD So were just trying to show our solidarity with Ukraine Burgum said PERIOD



The peaceful protest was put together slightly last minute given President Zelenskyys call that was put out on Twitter was done so yesterday PERIOD Frantz concludes The turnout was good. showing support for Ukraine in Iowa is statewide PERIOD Gov PERIOD Kim Reynolds ordered the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division to remove Russianproduced alcoholic liquor products from the wholesale purchase list PERIOD While the city of Chariton Iowa sports Ukrainian blue and yellow ribbons on every light post and gazebo PERIOD Whilst those on the campus of BV showed their support by standing in solidarity with Ukraine on this momentous morning PERIOD
