Researchers at the Universitys Center for Interdisciplinary Applications in Magnetic Resonance are shutting down the Tandem Accelerator Laboratory due to the collapse and reconstruction of the Interstate 35W bridge PERIOD

The University will close the lab  located  feet west of where the bridge fell  by the end of September because of health and safety issues associate professor of Radiology and Director of CIAMR Bruce Hammer said PERIOD

Were going to be in the middle of a heavy construction zone  and its not advisable to have students and faculty access the building Hammer said PERIOD

Kathleen OBrien vice president of University Services said federal and state officials requested researchers remove the materials from the lab due to the bridge reconstruction PERIOD

While Hammer said OBrien orchestrated the shutdown of the lab OBrien said she consulted the academic leadership involved with research in the facility as to what course of action should be taken PERIOD

The most safe course was to remove hazardous materials  and to secure the building during the deconstruction of the bridge OBrien said PERIOD

CIAMR is home to three tesla magnets which are used in research projects to help solve problems in engineering and the physical sciences PERIOD The lab has grants and contracts with biomedical companies such as Medtronic to help pay for the research PERIOD

The companies give you funds to buy equipment  supplies  and to pay faculty and staff to do research for a project you propose Hammer said PERIOD

Yet in preparation for the closing of the lab two of the magnets have been shut down and are being moved into storage Hammer said PERIOD

That means we have a robust contract research program that is essentially terminated he said PERIOD

Biophysical sciences and medical physics graduate student Beth Lusczek who researches in the lab said the lab shutdown is bad news for both contractors and their research PERIOD

Our space shutdown is definitely not good for our contractors she said PERIOD Medtronic is trying to develop pacemaker technology that is MRI compatible  and uses our magnets to do it. research projects requiring grants are postponed due to the closing of the lab PERIOD Researchers at CIAMR cannot apply for funding because they do not have a facility to include in the facilities description section of the application PERIOD

If you have no place to do the work theyre not going to review the application Hammer said PERIOD Thats a real issue for me  if I miss the next deadline I have to wait three more years to apply for it. in order to determine if a new location for the lab is available on campus the University hired RSP Architects a Twin Citiesbased architectural firm to conduct a building evaluation and report of the specifications needed for such a facility PERIOD

Although University officials doubt the lab will be used during bridge construction a decision will not be made until the results of the evaluation are released University Real Estate Office director Sue Weinberg said PERIOD

Matt Stringfellow senior project manager of capital planning and project management for the University said several options such as using the building for ongoing research or tearing it down are being considered as the evaluation is completed PERIOD

While the results of the evaluation will not be available until October or November admission to the building is not possible for researchers until bridge construction is complete Stringfellow said PERIOD

In addition to the evaluation RSP is generating a report with the specifications of what is needed to find alternative space for the lab PERIOD The document will then be given to real estate agents to see if there is any appropriate offcampus location to restart lab operations PERIOD

As soon as we have that information we will confirm if  there is no Universityowned space that can accommodate the lab Weinberg said PERIOD Were waiting for the specifications  to get a good understanding  because Hammers space need is fairly unique. hammer said a few areas on campus have been discussed as possible new locations for the lab PERIOD The music education building is an ideal site for the magnets but would require extensive renovation that would be paid by the University Hammer said PERIOD

The University  would be very hesitant to take the renovations  on themselves he said PERIOD Its expenses PERIOD It all boils down to dollars. if forced to relocate researchers at the lab said they prefer a location on campus so students can be educated and work in the facility PERIOD

If were off campus that makes it more like a business rather than a University operation Hammer said PERIOD It makes things much more difficult for both students and us. going to the lab in the middle of the bridge collapse site has been stressful and draining Lusczek said PERIOD

If I knew what was going to happen I would make a plan for it and it would be OK Lusczek said PERIOD Its frustrating not knowing what is going to happen to us. hammer said the lab has done work with  different corporations and is an integral part of the community PERIOD

Losing this resource isnt just my problem  its really the Universitys problem he said PERIOD Im still going to get a paycheck but losing this facility is going to impact many programs around campus. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
