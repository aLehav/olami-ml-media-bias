Andrew Bates Managing EditorOctober  

This past fall the University of WisconsinLa Crosse received a UW System grant for students that have experienced challenges such as foster care orphanhood homelessness or guardianship PERIOD The program is called Fostering Success for Independent Scholars PERIOD It began at UWStout in  and this year UWL as well as numerous other UW schools including UWWhitewater UWMilwaukee UWEau Claire and UWRiver Falls have implemented the program PERIOD

The grant program is offering resources and support including a  scholarship emergency funds access to supplies and personal items help in applying for assistance programs and more for eligible students PERIOD

Across the UW System  was awarded towards the grant program for the  state budget and UWL was allotted the maximum amount possible PERIOD The UW System provided UWL with  in funding which includes  for startup costs this year and  annually assuming all criteria are met according to Campus Connection PERIOD

According to Wisconsin Public Radio UWStouts program has grown from  to  students since it began in  and these students have also seen a marked growth in average cumulative GPA which has raised from . to . pERIOD

Stacy NarcottaWelp director of Student Support Services SSS said this was a benchmark year for the program and UWL currently has  students enrolled PERIOD Director NarcottaWelp said We have roughly anywhere from  to  students that fit this population depending on the year so there are several students across campus that are eligible yet have not applied for support PERIOD

The caveat to this is not all of our students fill out their Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA so the way were able to identify who might fit into this population is through some of the questions that are on FAFSA said Director NarcottaWelp PERIOD

Director NarcottaWelp discussed how the program has been going through its first semester and she said the big piece was connecting students with the resources they need and shes seen students come in for supplies they wouldnt have been able to afford without the program such as school supplies cleaning supplies food winter clothing and more PERIOD

Director NarcottaWelp said her goal is to help students of this demographic realize that they can be successful and that funding and support doesnt have to be a stumbling block for them PERIOD We have hopes as we continue to move through the school year to have some independent scholarsonly events that are focusing on some of the financial challenges helping the students in connecting to various resources said Director NarcottaWelp We have peer mentors now that weve been able to hire to help start building a community for those particular students. the next phase of the program for SSS is to get out into the local community as students are applying to college now said Director NarcottaWelp Weve created some marketing materials now and some info materials to get out into the community to those point people to let them know Hey UWL is a great place for students who find themselves in this population. its a great place to go because we have these supports that we didnt have before. director NarcottaWelp said if students think they may qualify or if faculty members are aware of students that may qualify she encourages them to contact her or stop by the SSS office for more information PERIOD

The new program operates out of UWLs SSS office which is located at  Centennial Hall PERIOD For more information on eligibility and the application process students may refer here or contact SSS Director Stacy NarcottaWelp at emailprotected PERIOD
