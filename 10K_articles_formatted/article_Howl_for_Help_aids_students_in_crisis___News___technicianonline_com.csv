When incidents are reported to student conduct a process begins to determine disciplinary action and intervention for students PERIOD

According to Tom Hardiman director of student conduct minor violations in which the student is found responsible will never result in suspension or expulsion from the university PERIOD Education interventions and probation status would be the extent of the disciplinary action for the violation PERIOD However serious violations or reoccurring minor violations can result in a more intense disciplinary action such as suspension or expulsion PERIOD

The classification of alcohol and drug violations can be looked up in the NC States student conduct handbook PERIOD

Hardiman said that if a student has engaged in the use of alcohol or drugs and they actively seek medical help on their own the university will not take action against them PERIOD This rule also applies to students who believe their friend is in need of medical assistance but they have consumed alcohol or drugs themselves PERIOD

We want to reward any helpseeking behavior Hardiman said PERIOD We want to prioritize safety and wellbeing above anything else. hardiman mentioned that not a lot of people know about the Howl for Help program PERIOD NC State is a large campus and only about  alcohol and drug violations that are reported a year fit the Howl for Help criteria PERIOD

I would much rather someone wake up in a hospital bed than not wake up at all Hardiman said PERIOD

Monica Osburn executive director at the Counseling Center and licensed professional counselor said that the biggest component for helping a student with a substance problem is their desire to stop using PERIOD

We do substance abuse assessments all the time Osburn said PERIOD When we do those it is really about engaging a students desire to stop using. another group that provides support is Collegiate Recovery a fairly new group on campus that provides a community for students who are actively seeking sobriety PERIOD According to Hardiman it is an opportunity for students to build a social network while building a support network PERIOD
