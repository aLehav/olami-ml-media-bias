6982,2023-11-03,"in a highly anticipated matchup at Madison Square Garden the No PERIOD  UConn mens hockey team was shut out by Cornell  PERIOD

This game was the twenty-seventh time that the Big Red has played at the Garden and they hold an alltime record of  in this arena PERIOD Cornells dominance over the Huskies showed that they are comfortable playing on this ice and in front of their home crowd in the Big Apple PERIOD

From the puck drop Cornell overpowered the Huskies PERIOD They set the tone early scoring a goal  seconds into the game PERIOD Cornells Dalton Bancroft found the loose puck next to the net and shot it past UConn goaltender Logan Terness PERIOD The team wasted no time after and found the net for a second time making the score  early in the first period PERIOD They continued to pressure UConns defense scoring yet another goal while the net was unattended to finish the period with a  lead PERIOD

The game was at a standstill for a bit in the second period until the Big Red struck again PERIOD Bancroft was on fire for Cornell scoring his second and third goals of the game to extend its lead to  over the Huskies PERIOD Connecticut continued to struggle on offense and never got momentum going PERIOD Cornell goaltender Ian Shane silenced the Huskies making  saves in the first two periods PERIOD

Going into the third period UConn continued to be shut out by the Big Red PERIOD Cornell added another goal in the final minutes of the game extending the lead to  PERIOD

In between play the Garden roared with Red as most of the crowd was filled with Cornell fans PERIOD The environment was immaculate from the start and the energy created from the crowd bolstered Cornells confidence PERIOD The fans definitely had an effect on the game as they erupted when Cornell scored its first two goals PERIOD

In Midtown Manhattan the Huskies were defeated by Cornell making their record fall to  PERIOD They were  on the power play and got outshot by Cornell  PERIOD

Overall this was a disappointing and shocking loss for the Huskies PERIOD They struggled from the start and never got into a rhythm PERIOD This type of play is different from the patterns that UConn has been showcasing this season PERIOD There have been games against teams like Providence Boston College and Boston University where the Huskies have trailed but they overcame their weaknesses to fight their way to a comeback win PERIOD That was not the case in this game with Cornells powerful defense giving the Huskies very limited chances to do any damage at all PERIOD

Its a long season one game does not define the season UConn head coach Mike Cavanaugh said on the teams performance PERIOD Tonight they Cornell were much better than we were. the Huskies look to rebound on Tuesday when they travel to North Andover Mass PERIOD to face No PERIOD  Merrimack at seven p.m PERIOD Although this is an opportunity for Connecticut to bounce back after a harsh outing at the Garden they are facing a top  opponent in Merrimack PERIOD

The Warriors will come into this matchup with a  record PERIOD They are on a roll in their most recent stretch of play as they have a sevengame winning streak PERIOD A strength for Merrimack has been their tough defense PERIOD Two weeks ago graduate student Slava Demin was awarded with Hockey East Defender of the Week after this performance against the University of Maine PERIOD He has had a lot of success with passing in their most recent games PERIOD

Sometimes I think thats the best thing to be able to play right again so we dont have to wait a week Coach Cavanaugh on UConns quick turnaround against Merrimack PERIOD Another very good quality opponent whos been playing great hockey. after this game the Huskies fell two spots on the NCAA rankings and now sit at No PERIOD  PERIOD UConn looks to get back on their feet as they prepare for No PERIOD  Merrimack PERIOD The time frame between their upcoming game and the Frozen Apple is shorter than the Huskies are used to but they could definitely use it as an advantage PERIOD Instead of dwelling on the brutal loss against Cornell UConn is forced to get back on the ice and get back into the groove which might benefit its play PERIOD

After the Huskies play in North Andover on Tuesday they will return home to Storrs to get ready for another game against the Warriors PERIOD Connecticut will have a few days off but will be back in action on Friday Dec PERIOD  to play Merrimack at home PERIOD Puck drop is set for  p.m PERIOD at the XL Center in Hartford PERIOD
