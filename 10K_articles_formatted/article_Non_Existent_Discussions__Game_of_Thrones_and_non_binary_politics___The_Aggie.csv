Bran the Broken King of the Six Kingdoms Breaker of Genders

The fire of HBOs Game of Thrones has been reduced to its embers PERIOD Its finale is still a hot topic but since the series concluded its once blinding flame now casts a light on the issues of gender politics within the show and how these issues mirror those in twenty-first century politics PERIOD Show viewers and book readers alike are unanimously disappointed with how Dan Weiss and David Benioff wrapped up the epic series particularly with the decision to kill off Daenerys Targaryen the allpowerful matriarch and instill another male ruler PERIOD Most likely this ending already contributed to libraries worth of articles highlighting the shows neglection of capable female rulers PERIOD But one overlooked aspect of the shows finale is the decision to place a genderfluid character upon the onceIron Throne Bran the Broken i.e PERIOD the ThreeEyed Raven PERIOD

It is nearly impossible to view any piece of art without holding it under the scope of twenty-first century values hence the extensive discussions about the absence of Queendom and female Knightdom in Game of Thrones. popular interpretations of Game of Thrones have been done through a selective scope PERIOD But while such focus is drawn to the divide of the dancefloor many onlookers do not have the tools to see who is dancing  the characters who refuse to meet the standards of gender in Westeros PERIOD

The concept of nonbinary identities in Westeros did not exist in the fourth century AC After Aegons Conquest explaining why all characters still refer to the ThreeEyed Raven as Bran a character who used the pronoun he. in many ways the former friends and family of Bran Stark do not know what do with this new omniscient being therefore resorting to an identity thats comfortable for them PERIOD The ThreeEyed Raven does not stand on either end of the gender spectrum they sit somewhere above it all as an essence of knowledge that transcends the roles placed by humans on one another PERIOD The ThreeEyed Raven is deemed king but never wears a crown PERIOD They are named the true born son of Eddard Stark but reject the title PERIOD Sansa says Bran who has not been Bran since season six will father no children and will likely take no bride as the divine royal rights were abolished in the finale PERIOD Therefore who is to assign the ThreeEyed Raven a gender Those of the Westerosi aristocracy of course as they have no knowledge of the term or what it means to exist outside of the binary PERIOD But for viewers to refuse to recognize the ThreeEyed Raven in this light says a great deal about the current conversations surrounding the nonbinary community PERIOD

One day after Game of Thrones ended Representative Alexandria OcasioCortez and Senator Elizabeth Warren sat down to converse about the shows ending PERIOD OcasioCortez commented we were so close to having this ending with women running the world and then the last two episodes its like oh theyre too emotional. warren agreed with her then OcasioCortez voiced her frustration about the shows male writers PERIOD And while this is a reasonable conversation to have given our political climate it still says something about our society as a whole if two icons of the progressive movement forgot to include nonbinary people in their conversations about gender politics in Game of Thrones. if the first thing that comes to mind in discussing the political allegories of Game of Thrones is the inequality between the sexes then thats a good sign PERIOD The disparity men and women face in the twenty-first century needs to be reconciled PERIOD But if ones mind does not go to other outlets for allegories within the show for social betterment such as a nonbinary character taking the throne then it shows our world is succeeding in erasing identities that do not meet normative standards PERIOD

Consider the aspects of nonbinary culture all attention is given to the two ends of the gender spectrum but none to the middle ground PERIOD Those who do not meet the binary norms are typically met with silence or denial because communities do not know how to recognize and include the nonbinary in societal discussions PERIOD Too often nonbinary people are marginalized and rejected by the institutions to which they belong whether in queer spaces or under a government that attempts to force these individuals to pick a side that can make sense to the masses thanks Title IX PERIOD

Although ancient Mesopotamian tablets from  BC describe how the gods created an intersection of people that had no gender the term nonbinary was not coined until the 197080s when feminists Casey Miller and Kate Swift wrote The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing where they encouraged the use of genderneutral pronouns and acknowledged the existence of people outside the gender binary PERIOD Its unacceptable that the discussions surrounding the biggest television series in history do not involve nonbinary identities PERIOD And if the answer to that argument is that nonbinary identities did not exist in fourth century AC Westeros well they existed in ancient Mesopotamia and through the proceeding centuries of our history PERIOD If Game of Thrones is a fantasy retelling of our history it would be ignorant to cherry pick what parts of our history are included within that fantasy PERIOD

Consider the obstacles and adversities nonbinary people need to overcome in order to exist social rejection a wall of legislation to keep one from claiming an identity and a life underneath the prescriptive roots of Americas nuclear family tree not talking about the ThreeEyed Raven here PERIOD Yet nobody recognizes the ThreeEyed Raven as a nonbinary being because other characters within the show are keen to push gender roles onto them PERIOD The ThreeEyed Raven is the essence of an omnipotent almanac forced into the human body in order to exist PERIOD They claim no identity therefore they claim no gender and what better way to end Game of Thrones than to say that the future is nonbinary

The wheel is broken in Game of Thrones in more ways than Daenerys originally intended and if the show was interpreted through a more holistic lens such as recognizing a potential nonbinary character taking the throne then maybe it could influence the breaking of our own wheel of genders PERIOD
