And now we win like never before Sounders Sounders
We love our boys in famous green the greatest team youve ever seen
Seattle Sounders born in 

Though Seattles premier football club has only played in the top flight since  its rich heritage is still prized by its famed supporters PERIOD Every match day starts with the highly attended march to the match beginning at Pioneer Squares occidental park where the rave green faithful boastfully sing and wave their scarves on their way to CenturyLink Field PERIOD

On Sunday the march the match and the entire atmosphere felt like it had been turned up a notch PERIOD Our opponent the Portland Timbers isnt liked very well in these parts PERIOD And though they only joined the league in  the rivalry shared in the Northwest by these two teams is one of Americas greatest sporting fixtures PERIOD    Dating back all the way to  though not always played in what now is the top flight the Sounders and Timbers have clashed for pride for a long time PERIOD The Emerald City supporters threw in a few extra chants geared toward our southern neighbors including building a bonfire with the Timbers on the top. the game featured in what has now become the Cascadia Cup which includes the Sounders Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps PERIOD Regular season results are tallied to determine who is the best team in the Pacific Northwest PERIOD Many cities in Europe will feature two professional teams such as Everton and Liverpool vying for the Merseyside Derby in England or Atletico and Real Madrid competing for the right as the best team in the Spanish capitol PERIOD Apart from New York City as of now American soccer doesnt field cities with more than one team PERIOD That is why the Pacific Northwest has become the home of Major League Soccers MLS closest thing to a true derby PERIOD European matches can split a city in half but what is so great and unique about supporting the Sounders is that the entire city comes together hoping to come out ahead PERIOD

The game on Sunday though it was only the seventh game of the MLS regular season carried bragging rights strong enough to make it feel like a cup final PERIOD The match was loud as only Sounders matches can be PERIOD With the Timbers fans nestled up into a far corner of CenturyLink there was a clear direction for the blue and green faithful to send the noise PERIOD

The ninety-first ever meeting between the sides saw Portland sit back content to defend and use the pace of Darlington Nagbe and Maximiliano Urruti to conjure up a break on the counter attack PERIOD However being at home let the Sounders be comfortable in possession knowing the combination of Clint Dempsey and Obafemi Martins could always lead to a chance PERIOD The first half didnt present too many opportunities for either side though Martins shot wide from close range and Sounders winger Marco Poppa sent a curling effort just over the bar PERIOD

In the second half the Timbers were able to utilize their threat on the counter and had strong attempts saved by Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei PERIOD The first came when Diego Chara advanced from midfield and fired a sizzling effort that was well held by Frei PERIOD The next chanced arrived when Portland beat Seattles midfield line and Nagbe was able to advance PERIOD His rightfooted shot struck with venom curved just wide PERIOD

The breakthrough came for the Sounders just minutes after Portland substitute Fanendo Adi headed a golden chance wide from just inside the sixyard box PERIOD What seemed like a routine throwin came all the way to Andy Rose himself a substitute for Seattle who shot low and hard to Portland keeper Adam Kwareseys left PERIOD The Ghanaian international saved well at the first attempt but Dempsey was quick to pounce on the rebound and hit home for the Sounders PERIOD

The home side then had to rely on stout defending for the remaining ten minutes of the match PERIOD Adi came the closest to leveling the score with a header that came off the crossbar but other than that Frei was able to see out most of the Timbers crosses and through balls PERIOD

The Sounders claimed a  victory PERIOD Their back line consisting of captain Brad Evans and veteran Zach Scott who was standing in place of the suspended Chad Marshall quelled any possibility of the Timbers getting back into the game PERIOD It was a solid performance and one that is somewhat the standard in MLS PERIOD Consistent and tenacious defending and being able to take an opportunity that comes forth to score PERIOD

 of the best fans in country certainly helped especially when there is no one else youd rather beat PERIOD
