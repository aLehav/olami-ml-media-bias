NC Courage head coach Paul Riley talks to his team after the  win over the Orlando Pride on Saturday Sept PERIOD   at WakeMed Soccer Park PERIOD

The NC Courage are set to begin their  campaign this Saturday April  taking on the Washington Spirit in the clubs opening game of the  Challenge Cup PERIOD

The game against Washington will mark the return of fans to WakeMed Soccer Park for NC Courage games as the Courages two home Fall Series games took place before Gov PERIOD Roy Coopers September  executive order that allowed stadiums to open at a limited capacity PERIOD

The last time fans were in attendance for an NC Courage home game was Oct PERIOD   when the Courage beat the Chicago Red Stars  to win their second straight NWSL Championship PERIOD

The fans are a huge part of the club said midfielder Cari Roccaro PERIOD You really can feel their energy when you are out there PERIOD They support us and we try to play for them PERIOD After every game we usually walk around and thank them wave to them PERIOD To play a couple games in the Fall Series and not have them there was kind of a bummer PERIOD It will be really good to have them there cheering us on and feeling their energy again. according to club president and general manager Curt Johnson the Courage will be able to host roughly  fans  capacity due to socialdistancing restrictions PERIOD With current state guidelines the Courage could host up to  capacity but with social distancing the stadium cannot allow that capacity PERIOD

Organizationally and from a club perspective we couldnt be more excited Johnson said PERIOD It has been a long long time since we have been able to work our way into a game day with thousands of fans in the stadium and what you will see is a normal in quotes event with lots of protocols PERIOD Health and safety at the forefront. the team will be without seven players for the opener as Lynn Williams United States Casey Murphy United States Denise OSullivan Ireland Diane Caldwell Ireland and Lindsay Agnew Canada are all currently with their respective national teams for friendlies and Abby Erceg will not be available for the opener due to a back injury PERIOD Riley said they hope it is a shortterm injury PERIOD

In addition to the five players away on international duty and Ercegs injury the Courage will also be without new signing Angharad James who is still playing for Reading in the FA WSL and has yet to join up with the Courage PERIOD Riley said she expected to join between May  PERIOD

Reading is still playing so it is difficult to get her out of there she is still under contract Riley said PERIOD As soon as we can we will PERIOD As soon as they are safe and as soon they are out of the FA Cup there is probably a better chance PERIOD For right now she is there training hard PERIOD We have constant communication with her to make sure the fitness levels that she has there are on the level of the fitness levels that we have here so there wont be huge undertaking once she gets here. the Courage will also play this season without many of its core players from its championship teams with Crystal Dunn traded Abby Dahlkemper signed with new club Sam Mewis signed with new club and Jaelene Daniels retired all leaving the club over the last year PERIOD The Courage have retained both Mewis and Dahlkempers NWSL rights PERIOD

Since the championship we have had a lot of players leave weve had some injuries too so there will probably be six or seven players different from that team Riley said PERIOD That is the exciting part but that is the challenging part That is the challenge for us a lot of new players trying to do new jobs new roles. over the past few years Riley has always pushed the narrative of his team being the underdog much to the chagrin of fans around the league but this season might be the first year where that statement has some truth to it PERIOD

Ive played the underdog card for four years and I think most of the press has given us the opportunity to play it this year Riley said PERIOD Most of them have written us off I think we will challenge for the playoffs but there are four outstanding teams ahead of us and we are going to have to do really well to catch those guys PERIOD 

With so many either leaving the club or being on international duty for the start of the Challenge Cup the opener will provide an opportunity for some of the Courages newer players like Havana Solaun and Hailie Mace who both saw limited time in  to step up PERIOD

Solaun signed for the team midway through the Fall Series last year and only saw limited time but the Jamaican international has impressed in preseason and could prove to be a vital member of the Courages midfield group PERIOD During the preseason Solaun played slightly further back than she did in the limited time she got during the fall series and that could be a position she plays more during the season but Riley emphasized that he wants versatility from his midfielders. one of the things about all our midfielders and when we bring a midfielder in you have to be prepared to play the  the  and the  you have to be prepared to play all three positions... Riley said PERIOD Havana had a good preseason and she will be a big piece for us The way we play and the way play through the midfield and the way we break the lines she will revel in it PERIOD She is very good on the ball a super intelligent player. with so many players missing and a tough opponent in the Washington Spirit Saturdays game will prove to be a good test for this new Courage group and the opposing playstyles of the two clubs with Washington holding onto the ball and the Courage pressing high up the pitch should provide a fun game even for the neutrals PERIOD

The Courages Challenge Cup opener is set to kick off at  p.m PERIOD on April  and will be broadcast on Paramount PERIOD
