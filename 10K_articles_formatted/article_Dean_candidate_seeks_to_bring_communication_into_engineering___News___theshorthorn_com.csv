Raphael Lee candidate for engineering dean said the academic engineering curriculum system in the U.S PERIOD has to be changed to teach students to innovate and communicate that innovation to others PERIOD

Lee is a Paul S PERIOD and Aileen T PERIOD Russell professor of surgery at the University of Chicago and has held the position since  said Lynne Waters university communications vice president PERIOD Lee also directs the laboratory for molecular regeneration at University of Chicago Waters said PERIOD Lee gave a presentation and answered questions from faculty during an open forum Monday PERIOD This was the last of four candidate feedback sessions held for the engineering dean search PERIOD

For students to only have engineering knowledge is not enough Lee said PERIOD Students must know how to communicate the research or products they produce he said PERIOD Learning how to communicate and be persuasive is not part of academic engineering curriculum in the U.S. he said PERIOD

We have to not only teach people how to innovate but we also have to teach them how to be successful in converting that innovation or the product of that innovation into things that benefit society in general Lee said PERIOD Now that takes communication. in the current innovation ecosystem there is a lot of need for medical personnel to communicate with the engineers who create the new technology Lee said PERIOD This would give the engineers useful feedback to evolve and develop the technology he said PERIOD

Requirements for tomorrows education should be very very different Lee said PERIOD

The definition of engineering is beginning to evolve Lee said PERIOD Engineering not only deals with solving complex problems but also understanding the science of systems PERIOD

What engineers do is they analyze design build and modify upgrade systems Lee said PERIOD You cant really train engineers by giving them physics chemistry and math but you really have to teach them about systems. as systems become more complex they will have properties that are completely predictable Lee said PERIOD

Lee is on the advisory panel for a National Science Foundation program called Emerging Behaviors of Complex Systems PERIOD The panel created small microbots that move around when a light is shined on them he said PERIOD The panel had the robots do work he said and some days they feel like working and others they dont PERIOD Lee said this is the example of a living machine and the kinds of systems engineers need to understand PERIOD

Erian Armanios mechanical and aerospace engineering chairman asked Lee to comment on training verses education PERIOD

It is fundamental that engineering colleges train students how to solve problems and not just how to look up instructions Lee said PERIOD He helped survey individuals with degrees about how useful their education was to what they now do in the industry PERIOD Most of the individuals said about  to  percent of it was useful he said PERIOD

We have to train people with the information base to learn how to learn and how to adapt and do different kinds of problems Lee said PERIOD I believe in that. david Ewing mechanical and aerospace engineering senior lecturer asked Lee what practices help students adapt to what they learn are effective and what practices he would want to put in place as dean PERIOD

Lee said learning fundamental theory is important to understanding how things work which is essential to know as an engineer PERIOD

If he had already looked at the degree plan for engineers hed know what we already take a communication class Comm for scientistsengineers PERIOD And I cant comment for other engineering majors but in Civil Engineering we have an additional professional communication class our Jr PERIOD Year PERIOD

I am a senior in civil engineering PERIOD We had to take business communication engineering communication and some senior classes require a project due at the end of the semester that you must present as well as senior project where you present every other week throughout the semester with a big presentation at the end PERIOD If you cant communicate after two classes that focus on it and about  presentations by the time you graduate then Im sorry not everyone is good at everything PERIOD I think what is required of engineers for communication at UTA at least civil is sufficient PERIOD
