Carolyn Garcia  Wednesday February  

Between schoolwork socializing and extracurricular activities many Notre Dame students turn to fitness classes to incorporate personal fitness into their busy schedules PERIOD

But some students take that commitment to fitness even further by working as RecSports student fitness instructors PERIOD

Senior Caitlin Kinser channels her interest in dance by teaching Zumba a dancebased fitness program that involves routines set to international music PERIOD After attending her first Zumba classes with a friend two summers ago Kinser continued pursuing her interest in the program through a RecSports class the following fall and became a licensed instructor that October PERIOD

For Kinser the decision to become a student instructor instead of a class participant was an easy one PERIOD

I said to myself Okay I could either pay to take the class or I could get paid to work out and do something that I love Kinser said PERIOD Its a winwin situation. kinser said student fitness instructors are responsible for creating unique routines and workouts for each class meeting and are free to choose accompanying music for the classes PERIOD As a member of the Zumba Instructor Network ZIN Kinser said she receives CDs and DVDs with suggested songs and choreography PERIOD

Although the provided material would simplify Kinsers role as a Zumba instructor she said she prefers to choreograph most of her own material set to her favorite music even if it requires more time and effort to do so PERIOD

I really enjoy choreographing classes but at the same time its the hardest and most timeconsuming part Kinser said PERIOD My classes are one hour but it may take me all day to make up new routines. senior Allie Hamman decided to become an indoor cycling instructor after her own instructor of two years encouraged her to pursue the opportunity through RecSports PERIOD To qualify for the position Hamman took a grueling indoor cycling instruction course that involved six hours of biking and a written exam PERIOD She is now completing her second year as a RecSports instructor PERIOD

Although indoor cycling is essentially an individual sport Hamman said her role as an instructor has allowed her to encourage class participation in common fitness goals PERIOD

Normally working out is more of a personal thing and instructings more about projecting what you want people to do Hamman said PERIOD

Both Kinser and Hamman said they faced some initial difficulties leading their first few classes PERIOD

Having the microphone on definitely took some getting used to PERIOD I think that was the hardest thing Kinser said PERIOD Because I did a lot of dance in high school Im used to learning and doing choreography but when youre dancing you dont have to tell people whats coming next you just do it. however Kinser said those challenges gradually disappeared as she became accustomed to teaching her classes PERIOD

After teaching for about a month I got comfortable with it and started being able to have fun when I was teaching so now Ive kind of got my own style Kinser said PERIOD

Though developing class workouts can be challenging Hamman said she tries to motivate her students by providing them with fresh interesting workouts each week PERIOD

You never want someone to come to a class and think I could have done this on my own PERIOD Why am I here she said PERIOD You want to be pushing them further than they would normally push themselves which I think is the goal of having a fitness instructor. whatever the difficulties of their respective positions Kinser and Hamman agreed the rewards of seeing students improve outweigh the challenges of their jobs PERIOD

There were people that I could see a physical difference in and thats really rewarding because ultimately you want to see your students succeed and you want to see them getting fitness results Kinser said PERIOD

Its always rewarding to see people doing something I enjoy and knowing that they are feeling the enjoyment that I am trying to project Hamman said PERIOD
