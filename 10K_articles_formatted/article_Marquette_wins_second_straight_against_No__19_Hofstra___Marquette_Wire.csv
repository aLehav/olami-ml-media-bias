3267,2023-11-04,"marquette only led for one minute and  seconds of the game but that was all that it needed PERIOD Junior midfielder Blaine Fleming beat senior goalkeeper Chris Selva giving Marquette a  lead and completing the Golden Eagles comeback over No PERIOD  Hofstra PERIOD

We told coach we could do it as an offense Fleming said PERIOD He didnt put in any play he just said play your game theres nothing I can do now. i was open PERIOD I saw I had a dodge with a short stick on me PERIOD I just swept and no one came so I let it go. the win is Marquettes second straight against a top20 opponent following the Golden Eagles  win over Lehigh last weekend PERIOD It is also the second straight season the Golden Eagles have upset Hofstra the school that Marquette head coach Joe Amplo graduated from and coached at for ten seasons PERIOD

After winning here last year the players felt like that Hofstra team overlooked them Amplo said PERIOD We got Hofstras best effort today. redshirt junior Kyle Whitlow who scored the game winner against Lehigh had another big game for the Golden Eagles PERIOD He scored four goals including two straight in the final three minutes to tie it at  PERIOD Junior attackman Conor Gately had two goals and two assists Fleming had two goals and graduate student attackman Jordan Greenfield had a goal and three assists PERIOD

Sophomore goalkeeper Jimmy Danaher was heavily tested especially early on PERIOD He finished with  saves on the day two short of his career high PERIOD

It wasnt an ideal start for the Golden Eagles who gave up the first four goals of the game PERIOD The Pride dominated possession in the first quarter getting ten shots on goal compared to Marquettes one PERIOD

Marquette was not outscored again in a quarter PERIOD The teams comeback began in the second as the possession began to swing Marquettes way PERIOD Marquette cut into the Hofstra lead thanks to goals from four different players but Hofstra continued to keep them at a two goal distance PERIOD Marquette remained within striking distance down  at the half PERIOD

Hofstra seemed to find its mojo again at the start of the third scoring the first two goals nine seconds apart PERIOD The Golden Eagles answered with a threegoal run featuring two goals by Whitlow to make cut the led to one PERIOD

After the two teams exchanged goals the Pride again pushed the lead to two a  score PERIOD Both teams would go into a scoring drought with more than six minutes without a goal PERIOD With four minutes remaining the Golden Eagles were in need of some late game heroics PERIOD

Whitlow continued his impressive start to the season with two straight goals tying the game with  left in the game PERIOD It was the first time the score was tied since the score was  PERIOD

I think I started off pretty slow actually Whitlow said PERIOD A lot of my teammates on the offensive end was playing pretty well and getting the right looks PERIOD Finally they were getting the defense focused on them a little bit PERIOD My chances opened up near the end PERIOD I was fortunate to get those open shots. k.C PERIOD Kennedy gave Hofstra fits in the faceoff x in the second half a big factor in the teams comeback PERIOD The Golden Eagles won  of  faceoffs in the final two quarters PERIOD

However Hofstra won the faceoff following the tying goal PERIOD The defense was up to the task as redshirt junior longstick midfielder Tyler Gilligan forced a loose ball that was recovered by fellow redshirt junior longstick midfielder Liam Byrnes PERIOD The Golden Eagles took a timeout with under two minutes left setting up what they hoped would be the gamewinning goal PERIOD

The Golden Eagles played a bit of catch while looking for the ideal opportunity which came  seconds into the possession PERIOD Fleming was given space on the right side and the made the Pride pay PERIOD He fired a laser through Selvas legs to give the Golden Eagles their first lead PERIOD

Credit to Blaine Amplo began in the third quarter his turnover was the result of a good offensive possession by Hofstra PERIOD I remember him coming off the field and before I even said anything to him he said Coach Im cool as a cucumber. and he sure was. hofstra had one more opportunity to tie the game up but the Golden Eagles responded with another defensive stand PERIOD The unit forced another turnover and Marquette was able to run the clock out on the offensive end PERIOD

What a great game by two really good lacrosse teams Amplo said PERIOD I think Hofstra is going to go on to win a lot of games PERIOD Today we were fortunate enough just to make one more play at the end. marquette looks to continue its strong start next week against a fellow successful young program Richmond PERIOD The Spiders are also  with wins over St PERIOD Josephs and Rutgers PERIOD Richmond won the Atlantic Sun title in its second season of play last year PERIOD
