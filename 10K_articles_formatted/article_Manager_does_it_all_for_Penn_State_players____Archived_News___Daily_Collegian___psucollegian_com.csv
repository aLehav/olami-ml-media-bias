Birch a senior has been Penn States manager for the past four years PERIOD And the No PERIOD  Nittany Lions dont know what theyd do without him PERIOD

 coach Mark Pavlik said PERIOD 

While Birch is a virtual teammate joking with players before practice and hanging out with them on weekends he never envisioned being so immersed in the program PERIOD But volleyball has long been his passion dating from his high school days in Reading where he was an allstar setter and libero for Exeter High School PERIOD

Upon graduation Birch  whose 6foot2 stature is small by volleyball standards  realized he could not play at a Division I powerhouse like Penn State winner of  straight EIVA titles PERIOD But he wanted to stay involved with volleyball and asked Pavlik if he could help out in any capacity PERIOD

 Birch said PERIOD 

It didnt take long for the Lions to realize that Birch was more than just a ball boy PERIOD

He immediately impressed the coaching staff with his attention to detail and love of the game PERIOD So Pavlik asked him to become acquainted with DataVolley  the sports premier video analysis software  and Birch soon found his niche PERIOD

 assistant coach Jay Hosack said PERIOD 

At every practice Birch eagerly stands on the court alongside the coaches and helps out with drills PERIOD And at every game Birch is on the sideline feverishly computing stats into his laptop PERIOD

Birch has become so proficient as the Lions statistician and manager that he garnered national recognition PERIOD In July Birch was on staff of the U.S PERIOD Mens National A2 team  which featured former Lions Max Holt and Nate Meerstein  for their goldmedal run at the Pan Am Games in Chiapas Mexico PERIOD Later in the summer USA Volleyball flew Birch to northern Italy to work with the U.S PERIOD Boys National Team in the FIVB Boys Youth Under19 World Championships PERIOD

 said UC Santa Barbara coach Rick McLaughlin who coached the A2 team this summer PERIOD 

McLaughlin liked Birch so much that he offered the Penn State senior a  salary to work with the Guachos full time this year PERIOD

 Birch said with a laugh PERIOD 

Next on the docket for Birch is grad school PERIOD He is looking for universities with strong sports management programs PERIOD Then perhaps his dedication and knowledge of every facet of a team will enable him to land a successful career in coaching PERIOD
