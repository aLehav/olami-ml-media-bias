Womens sexual liberation might be more complicated than we think PERIOD Women are declaring their freedom from oppression and patriarchal dominance by asserting their right to their own sexuality PERIOD The fight for freedom of choice is at the forefront of the news and contraceptives are being made widely available and increasingly affordable PERIOD Female music artists especially have been happily enjoying this newfound sexual freedom using their music as a way to express their sexuality and ability to enjoy their bodies PERIOD This is all well and good but I struggle to understand how these proud declarations of freedom have resulted in a long series of prurient musical gems like Booty and Anaconda. apparently theyre empowering PERIOD Or at least I think thats what Im supposed to believe PERIOD Both music videos involve women wildly twerking and slapping their rears to snappy beats PERIOD The artists main focus isnt on the music but on the excessively sexual content which has understandably sparked discussion on whether their lurid displays are feminist or not PERIOD Many have applauded their efforts PERIOD Derrick Clifton staff writer for online magazine Music Mic praises Nicki Minajs Anaconda as empowering to women PERIOD

...Its important when women like her fire back against male perspectives Clifton said PERIOD Shes showing that its not only men who should be allowed to show themselves as sexual beings in and out of their music. maybe this is what Nicki Minaj Jennifer Lopez Iggy Azalea Miley Cyrus and the rest of the long list of female musicians believe theyre doing when they hypersexualize themselves in music videos PERIOD If thats so then theyre seriously misinformed PERIOD The truth is throughout history women have never been allowed to be anything but sexual beings PERIOD

Historically women have been regarded as mere extensions of their sexual capabilities PERIOD According to Barbara Ehrenreich author of Complaints and Disorders The Sexual Politics of Sickness most medical professionals in the nineteenth century believed female psychology functioned merely as an extension of female reproductively and that womens nature was determined solely by her reproductive functions. this idea has been around for centuries dating back as far as Plato who also believed women were controlled by their animallike sexual organs PERIOD Everything about a woman was considered sexual because her only grand purpose was to bear children PERIOD This sexual objectification of women believing they were predominately made for reproduction caused people to assume they were filled with insatiable lust and prurient desires. if you want to know where repressed female sexuality came from you neednt look any further than this PERIOD Women werent allowed to express their sexuality because they were believed to be inherently sexually deviant PERIOD Basically they werent allowed to be sexual because they were too sexual PERIOD

We can see how this insidious attitude has poisoned our culture PERIOD Its no surprise that women are continually and totally objectified by our media PERIOD The documentary Dreamworlds  written by Sut Jhally describes in detail the appalling way women are used as nothing more than pornographic props in the music industry PERIOD In the film Jhally laments the onedimensional prison women face as being routinely presented only as sexual beings whose main function is to be pleasing to men. jhally said the problem isnt in sexual images or making objects of our desires but in our society women are portrayed as nothing else. women are so routinely depicted as sexual objects that even seeing a womans body can cause some men to mentally dehumanize her PERIOD A study led by psychologist Susan Fiske of Princeton found when presented with images of a womans sexualized body some mens brains associated her with an object  rather than an agent  of action PERIOD Alarmingly these mens brains indicated no activity in the area that recognizes another persons mental state or consciousness PERIOD In other words they didnt recognize her as a real person PERIOD

And yet were still being told that women who portray themselves as hypersexual beings are somehow empowered by it PERIOD Theres little to no evidence supporting the notion that women choosing to hypersexualize themselves is liberating or even different from present cultural attitudes PERIOD In fact its far better argued that it only further tightens the ageold sexist chains that have ruled our gender relations for centuries PERIOD If women were considered to be mere extensions of their sexuality for centuries gaining empowerment from objectifying themselves is like returning to prison after captivity and calling it freedom. women arent liberated by getting naked and singing questionable serenades about their booty. women will be liberated when theyre free to be powerful without being objectified at all PERIOD
