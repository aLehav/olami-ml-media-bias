Portland State has maintained open doors for international students PERIOD International student enrollment is at about the same levels as they were before September  PERIOD The number of international students increased this year  international students attended PSU during the fall  school term up from  the previous year according to figures from the Office of Institutional Research and Planning PERIOD

Likewise PSUs pioneering Middle East Studies Center remains an important part of the curriculum drawing students from all over the world PERIOD

The events of Sept PERIOD  brought national interest to the issue of international students studying in the United States PERIOD Rumors that Hani Hanjour one of the hijackers involved in the September attacks had obtained entrance to the United States by use of a student visa raised concerns that international studies programs could be another casualty of the war on terrorism PERIOD

Major news media including  and the Washington Post ran stories about the perceived threat that the current process for obtaining international student visas posed to national security PERIOD

Last November U.S PERIOD Sen PERIOD Diane Feinstein introduced legislation that would mandate the Immigration and Naturalization Service INS to conduct background checks on foreign nationals seeking student visas PERIOD In addition the bill would require educational institutions to immediately inform the INS when a foreign student violated the terms of their visa by not showing up for class PERIOD The legislation would also bar students from terrorist supporting states from obtaining visas without special permission from the secretary of state PERIOD

Feinsteins proposed legislation has since become part of The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of  PERIOD A similar bill has been proposed in the house by U.S PERIOD Rep PERIOD John Sweeney PERIOD

In addition to these new requirements an electronic system to monitor foreign students in the United States will be up and running by  PERIOD

Along with this system came a proposal to attach a  fee to the acquisition of a student visa to help cover implementation costs PERIOD This proposal has been shelved for the time being as the INS looks into the ramifications of such a fee most notably on students from developing countries PERIOD

While international studies seems a small interest less than  percent of PSU students are international students the effects of scaring away applicants could be farreaching PERIOD

According to the National Association of International Educators NAFSA . million students study abroad each year one third of which choose the United States as their host country PERIOD

The NAFSA also estimates that international students and their dependents annually contribute more than  billion to the U.S PERIOD economy and the Department of Commerce reports that international education is the United States fifth largest service sector export PERIOD

Secretary of State Colin Powell reiterated foreign students value to the United States in a Feb PERIOD  letter to a consortium of highereducation institutions As these students and scholars from other countries gain from our society and academic institutions they also serve as resources for our campuses and our communities helping our citizens to develop the international understanding needed to strengthen our longterm national security and enhance our economic competitiveness. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
