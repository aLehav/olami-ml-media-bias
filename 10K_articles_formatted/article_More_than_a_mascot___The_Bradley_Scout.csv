The new mascot has a lot of his tory to live up to and its not going to be easy PERIOD

Bradleys gargoyle mascot will be revealed during the Feb PERIOD  mens basketball game PERIOD As the uni versity gears up to advertise the gargoyle I decided to fulfill my obligation as a history nerd and dig deep into Bradleys glory days with the Brave mascot PERIOD

I searched through old Scouts Hilltopics articles Anaga Yearbook features decadesold Bradley publications and a paper written by Special Collections Librarian Charles Frey PERIOD

What I found is that in order to churn up enough spirit among students today as the Brave did in the past it might take more than a new mascot PERIOD

Lydia Moss Bradley didnt invent the Brave mascot PERIOD As early as the 1920s Bradley year books and the student newspaper referred to teams as Indians or Braves but there wasnt a defi nite mascot at that point PERIOD

That was until the 1940s when Bradleys athletic teams wore Indian head logos on their jer seys and slowly but surely the Braves nickname synced up producing mascots on campus PERIOD

Bradley proudly embraced the Braves in a day and age where depicting a Native American wasnt politically incorrect. braves were all over the place  as cartoons in basketball programs attending campus activities and featured throughout The Scout PERIOD

Brave mascots performed with cheerleaders at Homecoming events PERIOD One mascot in  entered and won a campus jitterbug con test PERIOD In the 1950s Bradley debuted the little Brave mascot Tommy Hawk who pulled pranks on ath letic opponents PERIOD

The cafeteria was named the Wigwam and according to the  B student handbook it was decorated in manner of a western lodge with Indian relics exhibited inside and Indian names such as RainintheFace or Chief Flying Horse burned into the wood of the booths. the Student Center was coined the Tepee. homecoming weekfeatured a Pow Wow variety show PERIOD In  a student met with Orchestra Leader Fred Waring in New York to smoke a peace pipe with him after Waring composed the song Braves Bradley Braves. speaking of peace pipes the handbook went on to explain that pipes were smoked before each basketball game with a represen tative of the opposing school to show good sportsmanship and fellowship. weve been the Braves for a long time PERIOD But its been more than a name and more than a mascot for a lot of people during those early years PERIOD

Being a Bradley Brave was a lifestyle PERIOD It was incorporated in almost everything students did on campus not just a mascot during basketball season PERIOD

Braves rallied spirit student involvement and most importantly pride PERIOD It didnt really matter if it was a Native American theme or not PERIOD It was something for students

to be proud of together PERIOD There was a sense of tradition of belonging PERIOD

Perhaps the reason why Bradley student apathy has increased dur ing the past decade is because of our lack of mascot PERIOD After conduct ing all my research I seem to think so PERIOD

Will the gargoyle do the job and help ignite students with Bradley Brave spirit once again Im not sure PERIOD It might be too soon to tell PERIOD

I dont necessary think install ing gargoyles in Geisert cafete ria or playing music from The Hunchback of Notre Dame will have the same effect as what the Braves did  years ago PERIOD

But I think any new mascot is a step in the right direction to get spirit back on the Hilltop PERIOD

Be warned that a new mascot popping up at random campus events isnt going to do the trick PERIOD

Well need something bigger than that PERIOD We need Bradley Brave spirit ingrained in all that we do PERIOD

Only then can we start our own tradition of mascot glory days beginning in the year  PERIOD
