Bush exempted imports from Canada and Mexico because of their partnership with the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement PERIOD Also exempted were Israel and Jordan which have freetrade agreements with the United States PERIOD But developing nations Brazil and Russia will both have notable harm to industry which could spur widespread protests said UW assistant law professor Gregory Shaffer PERIOD
This action is certainly not good for the Russian or Brazilian steelworkers he said PERIOD But with it Bush made a powerful political statement that domestic relief is important to the administration. under WTO rules Bush spared imports from about  developing countries that account for less than  percent of total imports for individual steel product lines PERIOD This relief will help steelworkers communities that depend upon steel and the steel industry adjust without harming our economy he said in a statement adding that WTO rules recognize sometimes imports can cause such serious harm to domestic industries that temporary restraints are warranted. peck said the UW Greens have opposed the U.S PERIOD freetrade policy throughout the Bush administration PERIOD He said current policy aimed at boosting internal industry will have global ramifications PERIOD
Sure Bush must have been feeling a lot of pressure from the labor groups to make this big change but the United States always makes up the rules for itself Peck said PERIOD Only this time other countries are just going to follow suit. the new duties cover  steel product categories and range from  percent to  percent PERIOD They take effect March  and cover flatrolled steel and other steel imports from a bevy of countries including Brazil South Korea Japan Taiwan Russia Germany Turkey France China Australia and the Netherlands PERIOD
The tariffs will be ratcheted down over three years so the  percent duty on flat steel which accounts for about  percent of U.S PERIOD imports will fall to  percent in year two and  percent in year three PERIOD
Bush aides said it was hard to say whether the curbs actually would cut U.S PERIOD steel imports which totaled . million metric tons in  since the U.S PERIOD economy is recovering from a slump and demand for steel could rise PERIOD
However costs faced by steel consumers could rise by  to  percent from current 20year lows they said PERIOD
While it enraged foreign steel producers the import relief plan fell short of the fouryear  percent acrosstheboard tariff sought by the U.S PERIOD steel industry which blames lowpriced imports for  bankruptcies since  PERIOD
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle a South Dakota Democrat applauded Bush for the decision although it wasnt everything many of us had hoped for. rep PERIOD Phil English a Pennsylvania Republican who chairs the House of Representatives Steel Caucus called the announcement a clear win. sen PERIOD Jay Rockefeller a West Virginia Democrat who has pressed hard for import relief said the action was a good first step but urged Bush to address retiree health care and pension costs that have stymied industry consolidation PERIOD
Industry reaction split along predictable lines PERIOD
The American Iron and Steel Institute which represents major steel firms called it a courageous decision even though it fell short of the industrys request PERIOD
