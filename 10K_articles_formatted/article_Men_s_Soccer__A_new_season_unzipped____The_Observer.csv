Matt Gamber  Friday August  

After posting a  record in exhibition play No PERIOD  Notre Dame opens its season tonight in Bloomington Ind. with a  p.m PERIOD match against No PERIOD  Akron PERIOD

The Irish will take on Duke at  p.m PERIOD tomorrow as part of the twenty-sixth annual AdidasIU Credit Union Classic a fourteam event on the campus of Indiana University PERIOD

Its certainly going to be two good games without question Irish coach Bobby Clark said PERIOD We play a very good schedule without many gimmes and I think the teams excited for this weekend. the Irish boast a strong cast of returners including seven starters from a team that fell to eventual national champion Wake Forest  in the NCAA quarterfinals PERIOD

Senior defender Matt Besler a twotime captain and preseason AllAmerican this season is one of three allBig East honorees back for the Irish PERIOD He is joined on the back line by fellow senior and allBig East player Jack Traynor PERIOD

Sophomore midfielder Matt Armstrong an allBig East honorable mention a year ago also returns PERIOD

After combining to play in just two games a year ago senior Bright Dike and junior Tamba Samba return to bolster an attacking unit that also includes sophomores Jeb Brovsky and Steven Perry PERIOD The major question however is whether the Irish can replace the production of Joseph Lapira a twotime AllAmerican and the  Herrmann Trophy winner PERIOD

You can ask me in December if we replaced his production Clark said PERIOD Its always a difficult one  goalscoring PERIOD If were going to be a good team we need to get 40plus goals out of  games PERIOD Youve got to get some goals but where they come from doesnt really matter. as a junior Lapira scored  goals to lead the nation and capture the Herrmann Trophy PERIOD Notre Dames top returning scorer fifthyear senior midfielder Alex Yoshinage scored three goals last year PERIOD

Joe was a predator  he scored goals Clark said PERIOD Youve just got to hope that someones going to step up now and get it going PERIOD Theres quite a few potential scorers. on the other side of the pitch the Irish will look to a pair of new goalkeepers with the departure of threeyear starter Chris Cahill PERIOD Senior Andrew Quinn and junior Philip Tuttle continue to compete for net time for the Irish PERIOD

They were both very solid over the spring Clark said PERIOD We havent made the decision yet and you could go either way. this weekend marks the ninth time the Irish have played in the event including Notre Dames sixth straight trip PERIOD The Irish return home to host Dartmouth and South Florida next Friday and Sunday respectively in the Mike Berticelli Memorial Tournament before opening Big East play Sept PERIOD  with a home contest against Marquette PERIOD
