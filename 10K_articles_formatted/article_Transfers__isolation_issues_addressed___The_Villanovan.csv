This is a followup to the article Transfer often feel isolated at Harcum in the April  issue PERIOD

The housing predicament faced by transfer students accepted to the University relates to a basic shortage of student housing on campus according to Marie Schauder assistant director for residence life PERIOD When new students are accepted for freshmen year their admission is tied to the number of available rooms on campus PERIOD

Transfer students are offered housing after all freshman are placed in oncampus housing assignments PERIOD In other words freshmen have priority PERIOD

There is simply not enough room Schauder said PERIOD

However almost all students are given oncampus assignments within one semester PERIOD Spring semester promises much better placements for everyone as more students study abroad and open up rooms for transfers PERIOD

Schauder argues that many students are happy living in Harcum and that their biggest complaints are related to IT and Internet difficulties PERIOD

Space at Harcum is rented through Villanova and that college has its own separate computer maintenance system and Internet service PERIOD

When questioned on the availability of housing closer to Villanova such as Rosemont Schauder explained that transfer students placed at Rosemont found the facilities lacking and the rooms in poorer condition PERIOD

At Harcum students receive bigger rooms better facilities and easier parking all at a lower cost than at Rosemont PERIOD

Schauder noted that the University is looking into possibly building more dorms and Bob Morro executive director of facilities management said that while buildings to accommodate  beds have been proposed it may be a while before construction begins PERIOD

Another major complaint expressed by transfer students concerns the lack of support given to them upon their arrival at the University PERIOD

Many say the whole orientation process feels embarrassing and confused PERIOD

However Kelly Donio director of new student orientation notes that Villanova does in fact offer a many resources to transfer student PERIOD

The problem seems to lie in awareness of these resources since many transfers remain unaware of programs and other assistance designed for them PERIOD

Donio a  Villanova graduate has been at her post for the past five years PERIOD She has dedicated a large proportion of her energies toward helping to provide transfer students with a positive integration into campus life PERIOD

Orientation groups that include transfer students are required to have a minimum of five transfers to ensure their comfort PERIOD

In the 1980s it was customary to place transfer students together in orientation without freshmen but retrospective group discussions revealed that transfer students felt they had missed out on the orientation experience when they were separated from incoming freshmen PERIOD

So why do so many transfer students complain about being the sole transfer in their orientation group There are usually three kinds of transfer students those who just refuse to go those who are slightly resistant but try it and those who go ahead with it Donio said PERIOD Many students just never show up. students accepted to the University as transfers receive a custom mailing in which they receive information about a special dinner and breakfast for new transfer students where they have an opportunity to meet with fellow new students and to speak with professors affiliated with arts and sciences as well as upperclassmen who can address their questions or concerns PERIOD

In addition each transfer student has the opportunity to join the Villanova Transfer Experience program offered in the fall PERIOD

The program allows transfers to be a part of a learning community by taking a core humanities class with other transfers while attending a weekly meeting PERIOD

The weekly meeting is facilitated by Donio and includes things like trips to Philadelphia PERIOD An advisor is present for course consultations PERIOD

Donio says this process helps ease the transition process PERIOD The weekly meeting usually runs for the duration of half a semester PERIOD

Isolation appears to be at the root of the problem PERIOD Many transfer students complained of feeling isolated and alone yet there are clearly opportunities to feel more engaged in the community PERIOD

Donio says she is open to suggestions and wants to facilitate discussions from previous transfers on what can be done to get the word out PERIOD
