9823,2023-11-05,"i have seen many different parenting styles among my friends parents my sisters friends parents and even in the way my aunts and uncles parent compared to my mom and dad PERIOD I think it is interesting how different my mom was raised compared to me too PERIOD

Im  years old and I dont plan on having kids for a little while now but it is interesting to me how we will be parents and how different our parenting styles may be PERIOD A big part of me feels like we parent how our parents raised us but I also think the generation has a lot to do with it PERIOD

My grandma raised five kids on her own after my grandfather passed away when my mom was  so even though she did a great job of raising her kids she went through a lot so this may have made her parenting a little different PERIOD My mom may have learned a lot from my grandmothers mistakes and was able to use those lessons in parenting my sister and me PERIOD

Another difference is that women had children and got married when they were a lot younger in the past PERIOD Women didnt go to college or work their role was to stay home and take care of the kids PERIOD Now it is completely different PERIOD Since I was five years old I was taught that my education was the most important thing PERIOD I can still hear my family members saying Go to school first get a job then find a husband. these words often came from my grandmother who did the complete opposite PERIOD A lot of this type of advice stems from our family members wanting us to have a better life than they feel like they did PERIOD Even though I have heard that line many of times Find a career first I really do believe in it PERIOD I feel like when were young its ourtime PERIOD Its the time to explore learn about ourselves and the people around us travel and take it all in PERIOD

A lot of my friends feel differently and I feel like a lot of people agree with them while others may agree with my philosophy PERIOD I definitely want to get married and have kids at some point just not yet PERIOD A few of my friends would be engaged today if they could and it just seems like were still so young to me PERIOD I believe it somewhat depends on the way we were raised but it also depends on how our life is at that moment in time PERIOD

Whether it is parenting getting married at a young age or finding a career that we love I believe in the clich that everything happens for a reason PERIOD In my mind there was a reason my grandma went through what she did PERIOD It made her a stronger woman which made her kids stronger PERIOD My mom is so strong and I think that affects the way I carry myself on a daytoday basis and also affects the decisions I make PERIOD

Overall I have always thought that it was interesting to look back to the people that raised us and see how different things are PERIOD I believe that our grandmothers grandfathers parents aunts and uncles are the ones who shape us PERIOD They make us who we are and they influence how we carry out our life PERIOD If we want to get married young or wait and experience life for a while its all up to the way life is running at that moment in time PERIOD Its all about learning from the past and bringing that knowledge into the future PERIOD
