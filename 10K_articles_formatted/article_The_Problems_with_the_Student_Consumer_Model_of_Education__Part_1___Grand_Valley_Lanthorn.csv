We are above all else consumers and this consumerism shapes the way that Grand Valley operates PERIOD The consumerist model is the notion that a consumers desires should influence the availability of goods and services PERIOD In a university setting this manifests in the belief that because students are paying for school they should have a say in the education they receive PERIOD While this may seem reasonable the underlying selfserving culture of consumerism tends to change students expectations of education and in return the university molds itself to match these expectations PERIOD

Now to some extent this model can be a good thing PERIOD It encourages students to identify systemic issues and pressure the university to implement necessary changes thereby creating a more just or efficient institution PERIOD The consumerist model thus requires responsible communityoriented people and yet it has the tendency to produce the exact opposite qualities PERIOD Consumers have a tendency to confuse the responsibilities of their consumer voices with the egotistical notion that their individual feelings are the highest priority for a service based organization PERIOD This results in the restaurant patron who complains to the manager to get free food PERIOD Because students have grown up in this consumeroriented setting and GVSU establishes itself as a studentbased institution students tend to view it as a service and place selfindulgent demands upon it PERIOD

For example if you ask a student why theyre at college theyll either tell you its  because college is fun or  because college helps you get a job PERIOD Very few students can claim that theyre at college for the pursuit of individual growth through rigorous academic challenges without earning an eyeroll PERIOD As a result enjoyment and practicality becomefor studentsthe highest virtues of higher education PERIOD

Unfortunately the virtue of enjoyment is the root of most studentprofessor conflicts PERIOD For example one issue in education is the tendency for students to avoid professors who have accents PERIOD Last semester the Lanthorn surveyed students about their experiences in international faculties classes PERIOD All of them said that the professors accents interfered with their education PERIOD In a consumerist model this makes sense PERIOD Why should a student pay to be in a class if they cant understand the professor It is a professors responsibility to convey information clearly to students and if students cant understand the professor then the university is providing poor customer service PERIOD Consequently students dismiss the expertise of the professor or the value of an international presence in the classroom PERIOD

A similar phenomenon occurs in the classrooms of demanding professors PERIOD Despite the undisputed fact that demanding professors tend to create the most academic growth in students these professors are often avoided because they are mean. if a studentconsumer wants to get an A why would they purposely select a path that makes this product harder to get As a result students disregard the value of being challenged and instead seek out classes in which they are entertained PERIOD In this context boring is a justified excuse for skipping a class or not doing an assignment while a Chili Pepper rating on RateMyProfessor is a legitimate incentive for selecting a professor PERIOD

Sadly the virtue of enjoyment is implicitly reinforced by professors PERIOD In a business model you dont challenge customers and in a university you dont challenge the student culture PERIOD For example some professors ask Did anyone read the homework last night which legitimizes a student culture that sees homework as too high a threshold to overcome PERIOD Anytime a faculty member overapologizes for an accent or provides catchup reading time in class they are accepting enjoyment as a virtue PERIOD
