The Titans logo replaces the Fullerton F across center court of Titan Gym PERIOD Palm trees and the San Gabriel Mountains are also new features that give Titan Gym a Southern California feel PERIOD

As mens and womens basketball looms around the corner and with womens volleyball just starting up the Titan Gym has received renovations and a remodel to the court to put a fresh face on Titan Athletics PERIOD

The most drastic renovation to the gym is the redesigning of the court PERIOD They have taken out the longtime Fullerton F emblem at half court and have remodeled the baselines as well PERIOD In replacement of the F is the Titans logo in big letters in Cal State Fullerton orange blue and white lining PERIOD

Surrounding Titans are a couple of stylish orange palm trees with an abstract version of the San Gabriel Mountains in the background PERIOD On the border of the court behind each basket is the word Fullerton in bright white letters with the trim around the court in the traditional dark blue PERIOD

It was a branding decision sometimes the F emblem at center court gets viewers confused with Florida while the palm trees and San Gabriel Mountains on the court really exemplify the Southern California area Athletic Director Jim Donovan said PERIOD

The timing for the renovations comes at a significant time for Titan Athletics as they look to start a new regime PERIOD Already this offseason both the mens and womens basketball teams changed coaches with the hiring of Dedrique Taylor for the mens team and Daron Park for the womens team PERIOD With a new system and coaching staff in place Titan Athletics look to put a fresh stamp and take the next step PERIOD

CSUF mens basketball will host the Wooden Legacy Tournaments first two rounds of play on Nov PERIOD  and  which is the biggest tournament ever to come to campus and serves as a great opportunity for the country to get to know CSUF better PERIOD Perennial powers such as Marquette Miami Creighton and Arizona State headline the tournament while Cornell San Diego State and George Washington will also be competing PERIOD

In the first round the Titans square off with Marquette which year after year has been a powerhouse and a highly ranked team PERIOD The tournament and competition really gives the Titans a shot to put themselves on the map while letting the country see their new remodeled gym with all games being shown on ESPN totaling to a good  hours of television time PERIOD In reference to the timing for the remodel It definitely has something to do with it PERIOD The tournament is huge Coach Dedrique Taylor said PERIOD

On the other hand the womens volleyball team has already taken advantage of the updated gym by hosting the Fullerton Classic where they showed off the new floor and ran through opponents posting a perfect  record PERIOD

The support for Titan Athletics seem to be at an alltime high with the scheduling of high quality teams from power conferences and updating of facilities PERIOD

The change started at the top with Dr PERIOD Mildred Garca and trickled down PERIOD The court stands out and provides an identity PERIOD Were very appreciative and it gives us a chance to even more promote the university Donovan said PERIOD

In addition to the court other notable renovations include new sound boards updated weight rooms and the pieces in place for an instant replay board in the near future PERIOD Even though they seem small the updates can truly make a difference PERIOD

The new weight rooms will help with the training and conditioning of athletes while the instant replay will give fans a whole new experience with being able to watch exciting controversial and close plays for a second look PERIOD

Also the sound boards help increase the noise level to visiting opponents and helps the Spirit Squads performances excel by getting the fans more engaged PERIOD

All of these outstanding improvements and modifications show a commitment to excellence and to growing the experience for fans and students PERIOD The hope is that these redesigns bring in more fans in the wake of declining attendance at athletic games last year PERIOD
