If theres anything the Massachusetts mens basketball team learned from its first win of the season against Rider its that no lead is ever insurmountable for a young scrappy team PERIOD

The Minutemen  almost learned that lesson a second time as a rude awakening against another young and scrappy team PERIOD Sacred Heart came back from a 15point deficit to pull the game within four points and  seconds left in regulation PERIOD

However it was not enough to replicate the output that the Maroon and White achieved last week as senior Anthony Gurley  points seven rebounds sunk two free throws to help the Minutemen escape with a  win PERIOD

Its nice to actually get out of the gate a little bit and work through some kinks but at the same token being able to beat a team in Sacred Heart that I thought played well UMass coach Derek Kellogg said PERIOD
Gurley led all scorers for the secondstraight game while sophomore Sampson Carter finished with  points and eight rebounds PERIOD

Coming out of a timeout with  seconds left in the game the Pioneers  trapped point guard Daryl Traynham  points with a tripleteam nearly forcing him out of bounds near half court PERIOD However UMass coach Derek Kellogg called timeout to bail the freshman out of trouble PERIOD

Traynham gambled for much of the game which sometimes resulted in giving his man an open lane to the basket PERIOD However his solid defense four steals more than made up for some of his risk taking PERIOD

Defense has always been the biggest asset of my game Traynham said PERIOD I think that changes the game around PERIOD When you are picking up a guy  feet its hard to bring the ball up. unlike its first performance the Minutemen defense prevented the Pioneers from making a run early PERIOD SHU had a difficult time breaking UMass full court press but the offense missed several layups in the early going PERIOD

Senior Sean Carter who finished with four turnovers three fouls and zero points in seven minutes had the most frustrating first half of the Minutemen with two fouls and three turnovers in less than seven minutes of playing time PERIOD Kellogg attempted to remedy the problem by inserting center Hashim Bailey into the lineup but he also had problems finishing inside PERIOD

It wasnt until the second half that Bailey made his presence known on the defensive end with a block and three rebounds in  minutes PERIOD

Kellogg said these past two games are making him worry about why his team is getting off to slow starts thus far PERIOD This game is particularly puzzling for him because of how many missed shots came close to the basket PERIOD

The slow starts are a little bit of a concern Kellogg said PERIOD Im going to watch the tapes and see why were getting off to slow starts. forward Matt Hill who contributed largely on the defensive effort in the win against Rider once again made the most of his eight minutes with two steals and a block in the first half PERIOD The Minutemen went on a  run to end their dry spell and took command of the game PERIOD

UMass extended its lead to  with  to go before the break PERIOD However SHU shortened the deficit to seven points at halftime PERIOD

Coming out of the break the Pioneers went on an  run to give them a onepoint lead but Traynham and Hills baskets put the Minutemen back in the lead for the remainder of the game PERIOD

The Minutemen continue the Hall of Fame Tipoff Tournament in Springfield with games on Saturday against New Mexico State and Monday against Texas Christian PERIOD
