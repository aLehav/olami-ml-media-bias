It is coming down to the last few games of the season as the Eagles try to make a push in the standings to finish with one of four firstround byes in the Big Sky Conference Tournament PERIOD

Going into the weekend with a fourgame winning streak EWU faced the University of North Dakota and the University of Northern Colorado coming away  PERIOD The Eagles are now  overall and  in conference play PERIOD

On Feb PERIOD  EWU took on UND in a battle for the lone third place spot in the standings PERIOD The Eagles started out the game just as hot as they were the past four games making shot after shot PERIOD

At one point in the first half the team went on a  run to put EWU up  with  left in the game PERIOD EWU shot at a  percent mark from the field and a  percent mark from the 3point line while holding UND to  percent and  percent respectively PERIOD

Senior guard Austin McBroom had a monster first half shooting  from the field and  from the arc PERIOD He had already reached the 20point mark in the first half to lead the team to  going into the final half of the game PERIOD

The second half was a different story as the Eagles shot only  percent from the line and  percent from the arc as a team PERIOD Fortunately senior forward Venky Jois put up  points in the final  minutes of the game to carry the team the rest of the way to a  victory PERIOD

McBroom finished the game with a career high  points to go along with five assists and four rebounds PERIOD

Jois ended the night with  points sinking a perfect 9of9 from the field PERIOD The school record is 10of10 made by Chris White on Feb PERIOD   against Montana State PERIOD Jois was just one rebound shy of his thirty-fifth career doubledouble PERIOD
Sophomore forward Bogdan Bliznyuk scored  points and collected nine boards PERIOD

EWU went headtohead with UNC on Feb PERIOD  and came out with a  lead to start the game PERIOD After a dominant first half the Eagles went into halftime leading  PERIOD

They shot at a  percent mark from the field and  percent from the 3point line while holding UNC to  percent from the field and  percent from the arc PERIOD

McBroom had already made four of seven 3point shots to have  points at the half PERIOD

The second half of the game was much closer but EWU already established a commanding lead to keep UNC at bay PERIOD The Eagles shot at a  percent mark from the field in the second half and  percent from the arc PERIOD

McBroom added three more 3pointers to his day and carried the team to a  victory PERIOD He finished the game with  points setting his career high yet again PERIOD McBroom scored a total of  points in the past two games PERIOD

Jois had his thirty-fifth career doubledouble with  points and  rebounds PERIOD He made all but one of his  field goals over the twogame homestand PERIOD

Bliznyuk finished with  points and eight rebounds while junior forward Felix Von Hofe scored  points PERIOD

With the pair of wins the Eagles remain in third place in the Big Sky Conference and extend their winning streak to six games PERIOD

What a great win and for Austin to have  points in two games said head coach Jim Hayford PERIOD Both games were similar  we opened up a big lead and the other team wouldnt let the game end PERIOD We kept pushing and had two doubledigit wins over teams that defeated us earlier PERIOD I think it shows we are improving a lot. eWU hits the road to play their final three road games of the season starting with Sacramento State on Feb PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD
