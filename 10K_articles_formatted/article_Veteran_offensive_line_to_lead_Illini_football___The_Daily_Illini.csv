Senior Quarterback Brandon Peters scans the field as the offensive line protects him during the match against Akron on Sep PERIOD  .Peters will be returning to Illinois for one more season PERIOD

By Josh Pietsch Staff Writer August  

Illinois football fans have a lot to look forward to if they get to see a spring college football season PERIOD In whats anticipated to be the best Illini team of the Lovie Smith era there are many bright spots looking to shine and compete with the best the conference has to offer PERIOD

Senior Brandon Peters a secondyear starter and transfer from Michigan will lead the offense and is expected to have a breakout season PERIOD He has targets to throw too including the Imatorbhebhe brothers and Junior transfer Luke Ford but that isnt it for key pieces on offense PERIOD

The Illini are expected to start four seniors and a junior on their offensive line this season PERIOD After relying on underclassmen more than ever the past few seasons offensive coordinator Rod Smith has all upperclassmen to protect Peters PERIOD A spring season could benefit the offensive line the most of any position not only to play a seniorfinal season but for multiple players to raise their draft stock for the NFL PERIOD

Doug Kramer who has started  games over the past three seasons for Illinois was rated by Pro Football Focus as the thirdbest returning center in the power five PERIOD Though undersized Kramer has proven himself as one of the best linemen in the Big Ten and has emerged as a team leader PERIOD With the potential to get drafted the strong and speedy center knows he still has to improve in order to potentially get to the next level PERIOD

The main things that I was working on for the season were the run game and the main fundamentals that coach teaches Kramer said PERIOD Footwork hands all stuff like that  Theres a lot of specific drills you can do but those are the main things that I think about. from the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

Lining up next to Kramer at left guard will be Kendrick Green PERIOD The only nonsenior on the oline Green has as much skill as anyone PERIOD One of the better recruits in his class Green has started  games in  seasons after redshirting his freshman year PERIOD Being one of the strongest guys on the whole roster the guard could end up playing his last season for Illinois in the spring and has the chance to enter the draft a year early PERIOD

The left tackle position belongs to Vederian Lowe PERIOD With questions about the depth of this position there will be pressure on Lowe to hold his own and perform at a high level for the Illini in the spring PERIOD The pressure is nothing new to Lowe though as he was thrown into the rotation as just a freshman and has since become a more consistent tackle PERIOD An impressive senior season could lead Lowe for a potential lateround draft pick to the NFL PERIOD

Blake Jeresaty is one of many additions via the transfer portal for Lovie Smith and the Illini PERIOD After an impressive campaign at Wofford and receiving FCS AllAmerican honors Jeresaty will play his senior season for Illinois and start at right guard PERIOD The other four members of the Illini oline have been together for multiple years and Jeresaty is the newest member of the team PERIOD Despite not having as much experience as an Illini the rest of the guys have made Jeresaty feel a part of the team led by his roommate Alex Palczewski PERIOD

Alex is a great guy PERIOD Hes been super successful in the field and I respect a lot of what hes done Jeresaty said PERIOD Hes a great dude and has shown a lot of leadership and reached out to me when I was in the transfer portal  Hes just a great guy. palczewski has the most experience of any Illini on the roster PERIOD He has  starts over the past three seasons and was a team captain last year as a junior PERIOD Most likely the safest bet for an Illini to get drafted the right guard was an AllBig Ten thirdteam selection last year and looks to improve on that in his senior season PERIOD Despite his recent success Palczewski also has a number of things he wants to improve on before the next level PERIOD

My pass throw still needs a good amount of work just to be able to set an anchor in PERIOD And then just changing up my body Palczewski said PERIOD Im just training to gain muscle and lose fat PERIOD I dont really care what weight Im at right now PERIOD I want to look good and have that strength that flexibility and have that power with me. each member of the offensive line has experience and skill which will trouble a lot of Big Ten teams come the spring PERIOD Although individual skill is important the group knows how important working as a team is and that they have to work together to be the best version of themselves PERIOD

Youre only as good as the guy next to you Kramer said PERIOD I think as a group we put out really good things  Theres definitely a lot of good things going on but theres also definitely a lot of work to be done. although the expectation was to play in the fall an extended offseason gives this oline even more time to improve their game and get ready for a difficult Big Ten schedule in the spring PERIOD With the potential for all five starters to leave after this season questions will loom about the positions future PERIOD But until then Brandon Peters and the offense will be set up for success with an offensive line that will be one of the best in the conference PERIOD
