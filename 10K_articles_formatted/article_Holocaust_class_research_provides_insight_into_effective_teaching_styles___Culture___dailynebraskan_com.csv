An ongoing research project at the University of NebraskaLincoln is taking course evaluations to a whole new level PERIOD

The project which includes faculty from the education political science and history departments began last year with the hope of finding what exactly students take away from classes oriented toward social justice and human rights PERIOD

Through surveys interviews and focus groups HIST  The Holocaust  one of the departments largest classes  has become a research opportunity for educators and students alike PERIOD

Ari Kohen an associate professor of political science and director of the human rights program at UNL was inspired to create the project because of the lack of undergraduate human rights minors PERIOD

Its surprising to me Kohen said PERIOD Its an 18credit minor on human rights and I would think that in todays world with everything that goes on all over the world people would be interested in human rights  especially when you think about the number of political science and global studies undergrads PERIOD There are almost none of them that minor in human rights. kohen has also been the adviser for the Amnesty International group on campus for five years PERIOD

I was struck by all these students that were very involved in the group but were not human rights minors Kohen said PERIOD And then there were these human rights minors who never came to an Amnesty International meeting. kohen said he started thinking about human rights and social justice and became curious about what interests people in the topics PERIOD

I thought were on a college campus and we have classes on human rights and social justice he said PERIOD I wanted to find out what excites people and why people take those classes  and whether the people who take these classes think they are good ones PERIOD I wanted to know what theyre getting out of those classes. the History of the Holocaust class is one of the main courses for the human rights minor so Kohen and Gerald Steinacher who teaches the class started talking about an idea for an interdisciplinary research study PERIOD

We thought this would be a great way to see why students choose to take classes like this Kohen said PERIOD We could find out what they go in hoping to get out of the class and what they in fact get out of it. from a research perspective the Holocaust class was ideal because of its size and because it is taught by the same professor every spring PERIOD

Another reason we picked the Holocaust class is because students have some experience with the topic  whether they had a unit in high school or saw something on the History Channel Kohen said PERIOD Its not a foreign topic so its interesting to see what students want out the class when they already know something on the topic. robie Sprouse a graduate student in political science became involved with the project last year PERIOD

Basically what were looking at doing is finding out what teaching methods and what material will really click with students Sprouse said PERIOD Were trying to get students feedback to try and help develop courses like this later on. sprouse said the study is important because he and the faculty involved are generally interested in the students feedback PERIOD

Were not looking to be the teachers that are dictating what the students are taught he said PERIOD Were trying to figure out what works for them what doesnt work for them and really use that information to try and develop classes for students that are fed off of what they have to say. the research uses both pre and postsurveys to gather general information as well as interviews and focus groups to connect with students on a more personal level PERIOD

We ask all kinds of questions Kohen said PERIOD Some are random some are more specific PERIOD We ask things like Do you usually sell back your textbook or Why did you enroll in this class Some of it is about the students were talking to some of it is about the material or instruction  the actual substance of the course. sprouse said some trends are already showing from previous research PERIOD

Our theory is that teaching from a narrative perspective using books and interviews with people who were actually there  survivors perpetrators  it really helps students connect with the material more so than a typical textbook. sprouse said PERIOD Based on our first year our findings kind of confirmed this hypothesis. kohen said the project really has the potential to impact the way educators think about human rights or social injustice for Holocaust education PERIOD

We can start out small with a single class on campus then we can expand it out to Lincoln Public Schools who have a unit on the Holocaust or even to schools around the country Kohen said PERIOD If we find that there is a consistent finding over time we can really change the material delivered to students. although the study offers no substantial reward for the time commitment necessary to participate in a focus group Kohen said the hope is that students will want to help make the class better PERIOD

A lot of this is really about my interest in delivering the best possible product he said PERIOD I care about human rights so if its about our ability to deliver the best possible product so that students also care about the topic then weve really got something. artsdailynebraskan.com
