9454,1970-01-01,"were midway through the summer which means were midway through music festival season PERIOD

While you may have missed larger festivals like Coachella Bonnaroo or Governors Ball other big festivals like Panorama Lollapalooza and Made in America are still coming up PERIOD One event that flew under the radar was Forecastle Festival which celebrated its fifteenth anniversary in Louisville Kentucky PERIOD In midJuly the nauticallythemed fest brought together music art and bourbon all along the Ohio River waterfront PERIOD

The threeday festival featured an eclectic lineup from indie rock to country to hiphop PERIOD This years headliners were Odesza LCD Soundsystem and Weezer PERIOD Other acts included Sturgill Simpson Cage the Elephant Waka Flocka Flame Judah  the Lion Phantogram and more PERIOD The artists are spread across four different stages as well as the Party Cove where lesserknown disc jockeys played on a grounded boat PERIOD

But Forecastle offers more than just music PERIOD An entire section of the festival was dedicated to local art and artistic fixtures were installed across the festival grounds PERIOD There was even a giant puppet of Hunter S PERIOD Thompson that walked around all day PERIOD Food trucks were woven throughout the festival as well offering delicious Southern grub like alligator bites and fried chicken bites PERIOD

The Bourbon Lodge offered exclusive bourbon tastings as well as classes on the popular Kentucky beverage PERIOD But if thats not your thing the adjacent Sober Tent offers support for those who choose to have a great festival experience without alcohol PERIOD

Friday opened up with a bunch of great acts PERIOD The first I saw was Giraffage an electronic dance artist that got the audience dancing in the Kentucky summer heat PERIOD Next up was Waka Flocka Flame PERIOD For a relatively early set Waka Flocka had an impressive showout PERIOD His braids bounced as he rapped crowd favorites like Hard in da Paint and Grove St PERIOD Party. smooth indie rock from the likes of Twin Limb and Chicano Batman added a nice ambiance to the festival PERIOD But this mellow mood was shattered with an explosive set by rap duo Run the Jewels PERIOD

The hiphop veterans tore down the aptly named Boom Stage PERIOD With three albums under their joint belt the Jewels had the crowd jumping beneath inflatable fists and gun hands with songs like Talk to Me and Oh My Darling Dont Cry. one of the best things about Run the Jewels is that they have been able to gain popularity without a wellknown single PERIOD Therefore every song they performed was as energetic and wellknown as the next PERIOD Headliner Odesza ended the night with groovy electronic tracks to bring back the chill vibe of the festival PERIOD

Saturday acts continued the fun PERIOD Cashmere Cat a producer who has worked with the likes of Selena Gomez Ariana Grande and Kanye West brought his eclectic sound to the Ocean Stage PERIOD He remixed many of his own songs with a wheel that he swiped at reminiscent of an actual cat playing with a toy PERIOD But by far the best performance of the festival was by Vince Staples PERIOD The Long Beach rapper had recently released his newest album Big Fish Theory which took a much more danceydirection PERIOD Staples opted out for any onstage theatrics even moving the DJ stand off the stage PERIOD Behind a bright orange screen Staples stood out in all black PERIOD He brought a serious yet dynamic energy to the stage PERIOD The crowd moshed to the majority of his songs especially to popular tracks like Senorita Norf Norf and Yeah Right. the headliner of the night was LCD Soundsystem who has been on a massive festival run after a fiveyear hiatus PERIOD The band brought popular songs like All my Friends and Daft Punk is Playing at My House to life during their set PERIOD

While not as huge as some of the other music festivals Forecastle does pull in tens of thousands of attendants with their stellar lineup year after year PERIOD Be on the lookout for next years lineup and maybe youll be able to make your way down to the jewel of the South next midJuly PERIOD","LCD Soundsystem, Weezer, Odesza jam out at Forecastle - The Triangle",Drexel University
