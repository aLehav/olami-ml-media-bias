With rain pouring down on players and fans alike the Stags fought through the eye of the storm to reclaim the Sixth Street title PERIOD

On Sept PERIOD  at Burns Stadium ClaremontMuddScripps CMS football stifled a PomonaPitzer PP second half comeback to seal an impressive  victory PERIOD In the final game of the  season the Sagehens defeated the Stags to earn their first trip to the NCAA Division III playoffs in program history PERIOD This season CMS waited little time to take revenge and bring the trophy back to Roberts Pavilion PERIOD

Although PP received the opening kickoff the first drive was an undeniable tonesetter for CMS PERIOD Putting together a solid drive the Sagehens marched their way down field putting immediate pressure on the Stags defense. however CMS defensive back Jacob OConnell CM  read PP quarterback Ethan Gretzinger PZ  like a book intercepting a medium passing attempt and taking it all the way back to the house PERIOD

Putting CMS up  OConnells pick six erupted the Stags faithful and deflated the Sagehens PERIOD Still he gave all the credit to his teammates PERIOD

Its all about the guys up front who were putting pressure on the quarterback and everyone else was holding up in coverage OConnell said PERIOD I was lucky to be there at the right time right place. looking to bounce back from the setback PP didnt make it past their first set of downs before throwing another pick six this time into the hands of Thanio Bright CM  leading to a  lead just five minutes into the game PERIOD CMS head coach Kyle Sweeney described how crucial these two plays were to the Stags path to victory PERIOD

For them to come out right off the bat and score  points before you play an offensive snap is incredible Sweeney said PERIOD I think it really settled the nerves on our side and put us on the offensive  from that point forward. just when things looked like they couldnt get any worse the bleeding just kept coming for PP PERIOD After another offensive drive stalled the snap sailed high over the punters head forcing him to fall on the ball deep into Sagehens territory PERIOD This led to a CMS field goal extending their lead to  with over eight minutes to play in the first quarter PERIOD

Still with so much time left in the game the Sagehens were unwilling to concede defeat PERIOD After a 34yard kickoff return seemed to spark life back into the team Sander Wimmer PZ  shook off a number of CMS defenders on screen pass dragging the team to a 20yard gain PERIOD Taking another shot to the endzone Matthias Olson PO  hauled in a ball over his shoulder just in front of the left pylon PERIOD Then with a quarterback sneak from the one Gretzinger broke the plane cutting the lead to  PERIOD

This concluded a wild first quarter as the field continued to be showered by erratic storm clouds PERIOD The Stags started the second quarter with a successful field goal going on to score one more and tacking on another Gretzinger interception before halftime PERIOD As the 5C Dance Company took the muddy field for their halftime performance both teams headed to the locker room with CMS ahead  PERIOD

Right out of the gate in the third quarter the Stags were given a taste of their own medicine PERIOD On just the fourth play of the drive PP linebacker Thomas McConnel PO  intercepted a pass by CMS QB Walter Kuhlenkamp CM  on a throw up the middle PERIOD

This would mark the start of the Sagehens comeback led significantly by several strong defensive stands and Wimmers twoway ability on offense PERIOD Rushing from the wildcat formation and bringing in an incredibly difficult catch in the end zone Wimmer helped PP bring the CMS lead to just  tallying  yards from scrimmage on the day PERIOD Still Sweeney was confident his team would find an answer PERIOD

The Sagehens are definitely unique and theyre very creative Sweeney said PERIOD Obviously Wimmer made a couple big catches and those hurt but we were able to bounce back and have an answer when that happens. and bounce back they did PERIOD Converting on a series of third downs the CMS offense entered the red zone where Kulenkamp found receiver Ben Kim CM  in the end zone without a single Sagehen in the area code PERIOD Kulenkamp described his mindset making such a crucial play PERIOD

Just make the read Kulenkamp said PERIOD We were talking about it all week  Kim deserved that touchdown so Im glad we could make it happen. putting them up  with a quarter left Sweeney revealed the scoring play has long been ingrained in the CMS offense PERIOD

It was actually a day one of camp play Sweeney said PERIOD Its nice when you can do something  thats part of your foundation and have it work out so successfully in a big moment. nevertheless there still was time on the clock for the Sagehens yet this was where the CMS defense really shone PERIOD After forcing a three and out on PPs first drive they would only allow one more completed pass for the rest of the game PERIOD OConnell spoke on how the Stags managed to shut down the Sagehens offense when it counted PERIOD

When we go out there knowing that all  guys are gonna do exactly what theyre supposed to do we can play really fast and have a lot of fun out there OConnell said PERIOD When we play as a unit were unstoppable. as time ran out the Stags emerged victorious with a final score of  once again claiming the Sixth Street trophy PERIOD Dubbing it an always a meaningful victory OConnell shared his immediate reaction to the win PERIOD

It means everything OConnell said PERIOD Its great to have the trophy back at Claremont where it belongs. sweeney added his thoughts on bringing home the title PERIOD

Seeing the trophy makes me smile every day when I walk in the building Sweeney said PERIOD

The defending conference cochampions will have the opportunity to meet again in the SCIAC final if they both win their respective pods divisions PERIOD According to Sweeney if they do the title will once again be up for grabs PERIOD

Gotta defend it if you wanna hold it Sweeney said PERIOD

The Sagehens now  in conference and  overall will look to rebound in a crucial game versus Redlands Saturday at  p.m. with a loss potentially taking them out of SCIAC championship contention PERIOD

Meanwhile the victory brings the Stags record to  in conference and  overall maintaining their lead in the Surf pod PERIOD They will face  Chapman away Saturday at  p.m PERIOD with an opportunity to put themselves in great position for the rest of the season PERIOD
