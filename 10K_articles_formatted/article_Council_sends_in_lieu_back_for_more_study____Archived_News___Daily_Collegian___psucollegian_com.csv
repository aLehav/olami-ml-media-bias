The third attempt by State College Borough Council member R PERIOD Thomas Berner to remove residential projects from the fouryearold inlieu parking program was shot down by a  vote during last nights meeting PERIOD

Instead the council unanimously decided to send the parking plan back to the Borough Planning Commission for the second time this year for further study PERIOD This review however asks that the commission consider  the number of spaces a developer can buy without providing parking on site PERIOD

Currently inlieu allows developers to pay into a special borough fund marked for building a new parking facility rather than providing the required space onsite PERIOD

Last week the commission completed a report the council had requested in October which states that the recommended changes to the zoning ordinance will address the inlieu concerns by decreasing the demand for parking PERIOD

Commission Chairman Peter Everett said last night that by controlling the number of apartments allowed in the borough through a density ordinance the need for parking will decrease PERIOD

Berner argued that although a density ordinance may slow down the number of apartments being built a need for parking onsite exists and buildings constructed under the proposed density ordinance should provide onsite parking PERIOD

Joe Atkinson Undergraduate Student Government Governmental Relations Committee chairman also advocated removing residential projects from inlieu and keeping parking onsite PERIOD

 Atkinson said PERIOD If the borough does not require apartments to provide adequate parking carowners are more likely to park in residential neighborhoods where parking is currently free then pay  per semester to park in the overnight campus lot he said PERIOD
