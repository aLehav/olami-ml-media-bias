Open Letter to former Macalester President Brian Rosenberg

On Thursday Aug PERIOD  the Macalester campus bustled with energy as the members of the class of  along with transfer students were welcomed to their new home PERIOD Some arrived early for various preorientation events but all  new students gathered together for the first time that afternoon for orientation opening PERIOD

These new students bring diverse experiences to campus PERIOD According to data from the Office of Institutional Research  Assessments  FirstYear Survey Profile  US states and territories and  countries of citizenship are represented in this new class PERIOD While all commit to Macalester for different reasons many highlight the location size and academic rigor in their decision PERIOD

I decided to come to Mac because of the colleges focus and involvement in international studies and politics and the kind and welcoming community I met on campus when I visited last spring Catherine Jardini  wrote in an email to The Mac Weekly PERIOD Im so confident in my decision to come to Mac since arriving on campus last week and I know its the best place for me

Macalesters emphasis on internationalism draws students from around the world including Laura Neal  an international student from Norway PERIOD

I came here because I wanted to have the freedom of studying liberal arts but also going to a college with a lot of international students Neal said PERIOD

The liberal arts focus and the people the liberal arts attract is a driving factor for most students on campus PERIOD One first year Maria Hadjiyanis  from Edina recognizes Macalester students shoe game as an influence on her decision to attend PERIOD

Shoes can say a lot about the population of a school and when I got to Mac and saw a swarm of Dr PERIOD Martens and Birkenstocks it was just the icing on the cake Hadjiyanis wrote in an email to The Mac Weekly PERIOD

 of incoming first years said they were nervous about fitting in and making friends in the FirstYear Survey and post movein many specified how welcoming the community is especially at the beginning when emotions are high PERIOD

Ive been surprised by how nice everyone is Sofia Kainz  wrote in an email to The Mac Weekly PERIOD I was super intimidated by the idea of meeting new people whether it be people in my class or in classes above mine but everyone smiles at everyone when theyre walking past each other. beyond the students staff and faculty have gone above and beyond to make this new group of students feel at home in their first week PERIOD

Ive been surprised by how peopleoriented the staff are PERIOD Its not at all a bureaucracy and people have been very nice as Ive settled in Cade Klein  said PERIOD Theres so much going on around campus PERIOD Its nice to have something to do every day. the Center for Student Life and Engagement with  Orientation Leaders led a fiveday orientation to ensure everyone knew the campus and had support they could turn to PERIOD Here students were able to bond with others as they acclimated PERIOD

It was super easy to bond with everyone in my Scottish House and all of the activities with them made it super easy for me to find my way around campus Kainz wrote PERIOD

Orientation experiences varied as the week was packed with activities such as Macalester student life lectures learning about various campus resources field trips out in the community and bonding activities such as the annual first night bonfire PERIOD

Orientation was a bit of a whirlwind PERIOD With all of the activities and constant meeting of new people it was absolutely exhausting. hadjiyanis said. im glad weve moved past that and are into the real stuff but I did meet lots of really cool people. already the class of  are making connections amongst themselves and with the overall campus community PERIOD

I have made so many great friends and I have an endless amount of friendly faces around campus PERIOD I cant walk from one location to another without saying hi to a friend which was never the case in my tiny high school Joanen said PERIOD

As everyone settles in and grows accustomed to the happenings of the school many are noticing the programs clubs and quirks that make Mac Mac PERIOD

Ive been super surprised by the amount of squirrel activity on campus and by the albino squirrel in particular Jardini wrote. im really excited to join clubs this semester and to get more involved around the St PERIOD Paul area and I cant wait to eventually take advantage of the study away programs at Mac. a common trait for Macalester students is their desire to be involved in everything PERIOD The class of  is no different as they already look forward to the Org Fair and beyond PERIOD This year the Org Fair is taking place Friday September fifteenth at 430pm on the Great Lawn PERIOD

Im really looking forward to the involvement fair this week PERIOD Ive already gotten involved in Concert Choir but Im excited to sign up for more things and meet even more people Hadjiyanis wrote PERIOD Im hoping that it will help me expand my horizons and turn the small group of people that I know into a much larger number. with their first year under way the class of  can look forward to the rest of their Macalester journey making new friends trying new things and making the college their home PERIOD The Mac Weekly wishes the class of  the best in their first year PERIOD
