Love trumps hate PERIOD

In the aftershock of Trumps win thats what many Americans need to hear and thats exactly the message Ellen DeGeneres shares PERIOD

DeGeneres a Louisiana native begins each episode of her talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show with an opening monologue PERIOD Wednesdays show taped Tuesday before the electoral votes came in offered an especially poignant message PERIOD

Dressed in a gray sweater with the word love over her heart she reminded viewers that even in the midst of these trying times Americans are more alike than we are different PERIOD

People have been very passionate about this race DeGeneres said PERIOD And I think its because we all love our country PERIOD We just have different ideas about whats best for it which is probably what makes America great. she continued saying that while we are overwhelmingly similar our differences actually make us stronger PERIOD But DeGeneres a comedian didnt stick with seriousness PERIOD She went on to propose that people who leave shopping carts in the middle of parking spots should be kicked out of the country PERIOD

No matter what party you identify with DeGeneres said she believes were all familiar with that feeling of stepping out of the shower and realizing you left the towel completely across the bathroom and you have to do that little shimmy on the bath mat all the way across. there is so much good in this world DeGeneres tweeted Wednesday afternoon PERIOD My job is to find it and to show it to you PERIOD Im not giving up on that. providing light in these dark times DeGeneres exclaimed that it doesnt matter if youre a liberal or if youre conservative weve all passed out watching Netflix and woke up not knowing what episode were on what season were on whose couch were on. choosing to conclude the monologue with videos of different animal species playing together DeGeneres demonstrated how to move forward and even played Queens Youre My Best Friend in the background PERIOD

Yesterday she tweeted a photo of a dog holding a taco in his mouth with the caption this is for everyone whos not ready to taco bout it. whether you relate more to an elephant or a donkey I think animals set the best example for how we should all get along DeGeneres said PERIOD

Not even two full days after Trumps victory some are already spreading hate in his name PERIOD Crimes have been committed in many cities including San Diego Lafayette Philadelphia and New York City  all in the name of Trump PERIOD But people like DeGeneres are choosing to look forward rather than back opting to focus on the positive and eliminate the negative PERIOD

DeGeneres ends each episode by urging viewers to be kind to one another a message we need now more than ever PERIOD
