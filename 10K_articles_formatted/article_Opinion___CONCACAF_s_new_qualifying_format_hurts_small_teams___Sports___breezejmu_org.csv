The new qualifying format created by CONCACAF could possibly help the USMNT PERIOD

As soccer fans look ahead to the  World Cup the Confederation of North Central American and Caribbean Association Football has announced a new scheduling process for its region PERIOD The countries in CONCACAF will take on a new qualifying format leading up to the World Cup which is slated to be held in Qatar PERIOD This new approach is unfairly favorable to larger countries such as Mexico and the United States and makes it more difficult for smaller associations to qualify PERIOD

This new qualifying procedure is broken into two separate parts including a hexagonal round and a group stage followed by a knockout round PERIOD These rounds will take place in  and will determine . of the qualified teams from the CONCACAF region for the  FIFA World Cup PERIOD

First matches are to be played by the top six ranked countries according to FIFAs rankings. round robin match play will be played from September through November  and from March through September  PERIOD After play is concluded the top three teams will automatically qualify for the World Cup PERIOD

The second part of the qualification round consists of associations ranked from No PERIOD  through No PERIOD  placed into eight groups PERIOD Groups A B C D and E will have four teams each while groups F G and H will have three teams each PERIOD Each group will play its matches during the same months the top six teams play PERIOD The top team from each group will advance to a knockout stage with a singleelimination format PERIOD The winner of that knockout stage final will faceoff against the fourthplace team of the hexagonal group PERIOD The winner of that match moves on to an intercontinental playoff against an Asian Oceanic or South American country with a bid to the World Cup on the line PERIOD

The new and complex qualifier stage plan has already received backlash PERIOD Alterations have been proposed by critics to achieve a more fair method for CONCACAF teams to qualify for the World Cup PERIOD The concern is for countries outside of FIFAs top six ranked teams as their path is much more difficult PERIOD Added to that challenge is the fact that the lowerranked teams can only reach a playoff to qualify instead of directly sealing a place in the World Cup PERIOD

Criticism is also being directed at the fact that teams ranked seventh and eighth like Canada or Panama are much more similar to teams in the top six than the bottom twentynine PERIOD

One suggestion to fix this problem is to place the  highestranked teams into their own group instead of six PERIOD The upside for the lower ranked associations in CONCACAF is that theyll be getting more experience playing in highstakes games PERIOD But at the same time the midtier teams may feel theyve received the short end of the deal PERIOD

Teams ranked toward the top will have no problems qualifying PERIOD With merely average results in matches teams like Mexico will advance to the World Cup with ease PERIOD The proposed new scheduling system will have a positive impact on the U.S. who didnt qualify for the  World Cup in Russia PERIOD The fallout of missing the  World Cup possibly contributed to the retirement of longtime players such as captain and striker Clint Dempsey and goalkeeper Tim Howard PERIOD Even though the team wont be as strong as it has been in years past the U.S should feel confident in their chances under the new system PERIOD

This new qualifying process has affected the importance of particular games played among countries in the CONCACAF region PERIOD Instead of the most important games being the actual qualifiers for teams hovering around the No PERIOD  to the No PERIOD  spot the more crucial matches are the CONCACAF Nations League games which can benefit their FIFA rankings PERIOD

In the end this new system helps small nations grow as teams increases odds for major nations to receive a bid and hurts middleoftheroad ranked teams PERIOD While this change addresses some prior issues its now created new ones and made the road for large nations less challenging PERIOD
