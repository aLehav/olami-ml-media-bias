3721,2020-12-12,"huge losses have become something of Boston College mens basketball head coach Jim Christians signature during his time on the Heights PERIOD The Eagles lost five games by at least  points last season and including Saturday have been defeated by that margin  times during Christians sixplus years in charge PERIOD

The pattern continued in BCs home opener against Syracuse on Saturday afternoon in a particularly egregious fashion as the Eagles   Atlantic Coast stumbled to a  defeat against the Orange   PERIOD The margin was the secondlargest BC loss under Christians tenure only exceeded by the 39point drubbing that Duke leveled against the Eagles last season PERIOD

In his postgame press conference Christian said that he was surprised and confused by the performance PERIOD

We came out the game started lethargic I have no idea why Christian said PERIOD We had been playing really hard PERIOD We played really hard on Tuesday night PERIOD Sometimes as the head coach you have to just take responsibility for things that you really have no answer for PERIOD Theres no way I saw that coming. bC looked unorganized and uninspired on defense consistently allowing Syracuse easy baskets on simple cuts from the perimeter PERIOD Orange forward Quincy Guerrier dominated down low scoring  points and grabbing five boards PERIOD The Eagles did themselves no favors in their attempts to guard him as they bewilderingly allowed him to match up against a smaller guard in the post on numerous occasions PERIOD

Syracuse had even more success on the perimeter draining  of its  attempts from behind the arc as it had little trouble finding open looks against the Eagles lackluster defense PERIOD Guard Alan Griffin went sixofnine from downtown as part of a game high 22point performance PERIOD Joseph Girard III added another five triples PERIOD

The Orange sat comfortably in their classic  zone defense and forced BC to shoot from the perimeter PERIOD The Eagles guards gladly accepted the opportunities tossing up  attempts but hitting just eight of them PERIOD

For the first ten minutes I thought we got great shots shots that we should make shots that were very capable of making against the zone and I think that affected us Christian said PERIOD When guys missed a couple shots early that they know they should make I saw them hang their head not sprint backits just not who we need to be. syracuse also proved itself exceptionally good at getting back in transition which limited the ability of BCs guards to use their speed and open floor ability to get easy buckets PERIOD

Jay Heath and Makai AshtonLangford particularly struggled scoring just five points apiece and shooting below  percent from the field PERIOD

Syracuse jumped out to a  lead just five minutes into the game on the back of three quick 3pointers and never looked back PERIOD The Orange led  at halftime and by as much as  at times during the second half PERIOD A 3pointer by Rich Kelly with  seconds to play was the only thing that prevented the loss from being the biggest of Christians tenure PERIOD

The lone bright spot for the Eagles was the strong play of James Karnik PERIOD Karnik a transfer from Lehigh who finally received a waiver to be immediately eligible earlier this month had looked solid in his first two games but fully came into his own on Saturday PERIOD He showed that he has the ability to be the post presence BC has so sorely lacked PERIOD His  points and eight rebounds were both team highs PERIOD

I thought he rebounded the ball pretty well Christian said PERIOD Obviously hes getting used to finishing against longer more athletic guys but his effort his effort was great his attitude was great. with another doubledigit loss in the books Christian is inching closer and closer to the hot seat PERIOD With a full slate of ACC games ahead of them he and the Eagles will have to shape up against increasingly tough conference competition PERIOD
