Fr PERIOD Gregory Boyle S.J. who has been doing service and mission work for Los Angeles gang members since the 1980s says Service is the hallway that leads to the ballroom PERIOD Its getting you to the ballroom which is the place of kinship the place of mutuality. fr PERIOD Boyles ballroom is the place where human beings stop pretending that they are different from each other PERIOD It is the place where two people no matter background faith creed race sexuality or gender can dance together simply because they are human PERIOD

There is something more nuanced going on in our nation than direct service that should be urging everyone to line up at the doors of the biggest ball in social justice history since Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD told the world about his dream The Black Lives Matter movement PERIOD

The Black Lives Matter movement is not an opportunity for any one group of people to start treating the Black members of our nation like human beings so that they can feel good about themselves PERIOD It is not an opportunity to fetishize Blackness so that suddenly everybody has that one black friend PERIOD And it certainly is not us white folk helping them Black folk. it is us citizens of the United States members of the human race helping one another become whole again PERIOD

Last week Taylor Zachary called out the white students of Xavier PERIOD He eloquently hid his outrage in informative prose and hes right PERIOD Zachary pointed out that us white folk are not owning our identity PERIOD Zachary boldly asked Why are my white counterparts not held to similar standards of identity When white people refuse to assess contextualize and question their identity they are essentially saying that they are the standard for racial identification and everybody else has to find their racial place in the white world PERIOD

In an article entitled I Dont Discuss Racism with White People for the Huffington Post John Metta said white people do not think in terms of we PERIOD White people have the privilege to interact with the social and political structures of our society as individuals PERIOD Whites are often not directly affected by racial oppression even in their own community so what does not affect them locally has little chance of affecting them regionally or nationally. what Metta is saying is that because white identity is just assumed for us because it embodies our whole world anybody else white Black Asian Latino has to find their place in that world PERIOD White people feel like they own the cultural norm PERIOD

I grew up in a wellmeaning environment PERIOD Love everybody no matter the color of their skin. it sounds nice and rosy but it translates to one basic message dont hate anyone because they arent white PERIOD Because of this I get the fun task of overcoming cultural bias PERIOD I get to learn the fine line between fetishizing racial difference and celebrating it PERIOD I get to learn what it means to celebrate other cultures rather than trying to appropriate them for my own amusement PERIOD

And most importantly I have to remind myself every day that being an ally for the Black Lives Matter movement also means being a  percent participating member PERIOD That means checking my privilege PERIOD That means relabeling harmless racial jokes as actually racist PERIOD That means owning the idea that a human life has worth simply because it is a human life and acknowledging that Black lives deserve attention because nobody has ever questioned the value of a white life PERIOD

Dear white people fear is a fun excuse for apathy PERIOD Us white people may not ever utter the nword but were definitely going to say the wrong thing at the wrong time to the wrong person PERIOD Own it PERIOD Know that its going to happen PERIOD Apologize for it and go out and learn and grow PERIOD Because when you and I sit back and tell Black peoplethat were too afraid to mess up and do the wrong thing what were telling Black people our potential embarrassment is not worth the betterment of another human life PERIOD

The day that America waltzes together in Fr PERIOD Boyles ballroom moving as one whole person who cares for and loves all of its members will be the day that movements like Black Lives Matter will have the vast relief of not being necessary PERIOD All lives will start to matter when we first recognize that Black ones do PERIOD
