Letter to the Editor  Wednesday October  

I had a revelation today PERIOD On my Facebook was another comment from my trashtalking medical school classmate from USC about how they are going to crush us this year as per usual PERIOD I referred him to the series record on Wikipedia but then I got to thinking PERIOD I thought about how my mom told me she felt at her first Notre Dame football game the  Green Jersey game  Irish vs PERIOD  USC Notre Dame victory National Championship that year PERIOD I noticed the span from  without a Notre Dame loss in the series PERIOD I remembered the best football game I have ever attended the  Notre DameUSC game PERIOD Then I remembered that the last class present at that game graduated in May PERIOD

My revelation No current undergraduate has experienced firsthand what this rivalry is supposed to be like PERIOD None of you saw Matt Leinarts face ducttaped to sidewalks all over campus a pep rally of over  people or ESPN GameDay on Library Quad PERIOD You dont remember the deafening noise in the Stadium the bliss of running down the bleachers when we thought we had won or the heartbreak of being called back only to stand there nearly in tears after the Bush Push PERIOD You didnt feel about as good as if a longtime girlfriend had dumped you for your entire Fall Break after the game PERIOD You havent experienced campus with the usual incredible excitement leading up to this game or the high expectation of victory PERIOD

This rivalry is one of the biggest in college football and has not always been characterized USC blowouts PERIOD I am writing to tell you current Domers to come to the Stadium ready to pour your heart and soul and lungs onto that field PERIOD Show the Trojans we are never the little guy in this rivalry PERIOD Our team needs our support PERIOD Im taking time from medical school to be in the stands on Saturday PERIOD So all of you who arent as far from your home under the Dome as I am had better show up ready to rock the House that Rock built too PERIOD Blake Jones alumnus Class of  Oct PERIOD
