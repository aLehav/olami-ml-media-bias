Students are expressing more interest in intramurals specifically in the game of soccer PERIOD This year there are over  students in  different spots playing intramurals PERIOD

Over the last few years the intramural soccer program at Occidental has increased in popularity significantly PERIOD When soccer was first introduced into the intramural program only  teams were competing PERIOD This spring there are about  teams hoping to win the Occidental Cup PERIOD This spring we set a deadline for team applications and there were more teams who applied for spots than we had room for PERIOD It is a great sign head of intramural sports Sae Woon Jo said PERIOD

Many students who participate in intramural soccer chose not to play varsity because of the level of talent needed work ethic required and time commitment necessary to be an NCAA Division III athlete PERIOD Intramural soccer not only gives participants the opportunity to meet a diverse group of students on campus but it also promotes athleticism in a greater percentage of the student population PERIOD Students who are on one of the  teams choose when to practice and how long they practice for PERIOD Some teams organize practices weekly other teams dont see each other until their matches Sae Woon Jo said PERIOD

Although actual soccer experience is beneficial the players can make the game as competitive or as recreational as they want PERIOD The intramural soccer teams are divided into two groups PERIOD There is the Soccer A League which consists of players who have had previous experience playing soccer and are generally very competitive PERIOD Ive played soccer since I was nine on various club teams and all throughout high school captain of Soccer A league team Operation Penetration Connor Smith senior said PERIOD The Soccer B League allows students who are playing for fun and leisure to engage in friendly competition while at the same time play as if they are in a real game PERIOD

Occidental gives students who are not competing in NCAAsanctioned sports a chance to compete through intramural sports PERIOD I have played ever since my freshman year and I love it PERIOD The fact that we even have an intramural soccer team at Occidental is awesome Smith said PERIOD

Although Occidental students compete against other Occidental students the players take the game very seriously PERIOD Many team goals that have been presented by team members include playing better defense and offense as well as taking home the title of Occidental Intramural Soccer Champions PERIOD I just want to ask everyone to please keep supporting Occidental intramurals PERIOD Its a great way to stay active and engage with other students Smith said PERIOD
