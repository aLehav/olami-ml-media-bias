7097,2023-11-04,"there is a new program on campus aimed to help students bring peace and clarity to their lives PERIOD Peace Works is a new program created in connection to the Hartman House to provide a lowtech hightouch atmosphere for the community

The program was spearheaded by Kate Smanik assistant dean of students for spirituality service and social justice as well as Coordinator of the Compton Center for Peace and Justice Valerie Rudolph PERIOD

Peace Works was Valeries idea for that kind of program Smanik said something that would help participants think about how to bring peace into their life and into their communities in tangible ways. the bimonthly meetings will be led by a different staff member from the Hartman House so one can expect each installment to have a different feel PERIOD However Smanik ensured that every Peace Works meeting will include cozy space good conversation and delicious food PERIOD

I think its a healthy alternative for students to destress said sophomore Natalie Bennett PERIOD

Senior Sophie Mazurek thinks that the Peace Works program and its low technological approach will be very beneficial to students PERIOD I think that a lot of times people focus too much on the future...especially at DePauw Mazurek said PERIOD So for people to take the time to focus on things besides work Im sure it will help a lot to get their mind off of stressors. the topic of discussion at the first Peace Works event chosen by Smanik herself was the role of play in creating peace PERIOD Attendees explored the idea of play as a way to generate new ideas a time to connect in joyful ways with others as something that allows us to tap into our own sometimes hidden identities Smanik said PERIOD This discussion was of course accompanied by cupcakes and coloring PERIOD

Although Peace Works is still getting off the ground Rudolph thinks it has the potential to grow into an important space for reflection and community building PERIOD Since the Hartman House is home to a number of diverse programs Smanik said Peace Works can be a great middle ground for inclusive conversation PERIOD

My hope is that this event allows new students to connect with our work Smanik said PERIOD If it is successful I can imagine that in the coming years we will invite faculty and staff outside of our area to share their peace works. newsletter Signup
