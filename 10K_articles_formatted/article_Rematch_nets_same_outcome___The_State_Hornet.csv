BERKELEY  In the end it all came down to confidence or lack thereof PERIOD

Sacramento State volleyball appeared to have that confidence in the first game of its      loss to 10thseeded St PERIOD Marys in Thursday night the NCAA first roundt PERIOD

But confidence can be a funny thing one minute its there the next minute it disappears in the vapor trail of an opponents spike PERIOD

Theres no doubt that we just lost our composure tonight Sac State coach Debby Colberg said PERIOD

Sac State  took the first game from the Gaels  by a score of  while hitting for a . clip PERIOD Despite the win though the Hornets eventually succumbed to frustration at the hands of a scrappy but equally talented Gaels squad PERIOD

The contest Thursday night was a rematch of Sept PERIOD  when St PERIOD Marys came to Sacramento and escaped with a  victory PERIOD The two teams combined for  digs in that match PERIOD

Its frustrating to know you have to take a bunch of swings to get one down on that team but you have to stay mentally tough sophomore Atlee Hubbard who had a teamhigh  kills said PERIOD

Still very much in control with the score tied at  in the second game sophomore outside hitter Shannon Roland couldnt find daylight in a Gael block and committed an attack error to give St PERIOD Marys a lead they would not relinquish taking advantage of three more Hornet errors and a kill from freshman Melissa Stidham to take a split  and momentum  into the intermission PERIOD

There was a sense of urgency we knew we needed it for our confidence to go into the locker room having won that game said St PERIOD Marys senior opposite Lindsey Bogason who had  kills to accompany a . clip PERIOD

After taking that  lead in the second frame the Hornets committed eight attack errors versus just four kills while St PERIOD Marys committed just three in that span PERIOD

It wasnt nerves its just when one person loses confidence it tends to rub off on the rest of the team said senior middle hitter Emily Wilson who had  kills in her final match as a Hornet PERIOD

Senior outside hitter and team captain Sandra Bandimere who has been the Hornets catalyst all season long managed just three kills and a . hitting percentage through the first two games committing six attack errors and two service errors PERIOD

Whatever happened to Sandra tonight happened to the whole team as well Colberg said PERIOD

The Gaels never looked back in the final two games winning by scores of  and  respectively hitting . in those two games to close out the Hornets PERIOD

This team has shown that it has another gear they go into when we need it you saw a little bit of that in games three and four St PERIOD Marys coach Jon Stevenson said PERIOD

For the Hornets last night marked their third consecutive first round exit the previous two coming at Stanford in  and  PERIOD Sac State has won just one NCAA Tournament game that coming in  when the Hornets swept Houston in the first round with the likes of Maureen Rafferty and Carissa Buie suiting up in the Green and Gold PERIOD

This is disappointing PERIOD Were okay with it if we go out and play our best and dont win Colberg said PERIOD Were not okay with this one because we know we didnt play our Agame and we needed to. nOTES Sophomore libero Kristin Lutes playing in just her third match since coming back from a broken knuckle had a careerhigh  digs PERIOD Junior middle hitter Shannon Arts had her best match of the season with  kills a . hitting percentage and seven blocks PERIOD
