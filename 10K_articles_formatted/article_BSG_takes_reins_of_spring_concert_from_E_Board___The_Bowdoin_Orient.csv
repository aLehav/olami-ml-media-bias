February  

Editors Note Friday February  at  p.m. A previous version of this articleincluded a headline where reins was spelled reigns. this has been corrected PERIOD

Historically Bowdoins Entertainment Board EBoard has been responsible for planning performances at the College throughout the year PERIOD These have included comedy shows and concerts like the highlyanticipated Ivies set PERIOD This year Bowdoin Student Government BSG is going to plan the spring concert BSG President Susu Gharib  wrote in an email to BSG members on Wednesday PERIOD

Gharib submitted a budget request to the Student Activities Funding Committee SAFC for the spring concert after the EBoard had failed to do so PERIOD The funding for the concert was awarded to BSG at the SAFCs Monday meeting said BSG Chair of the Treasury Kiley Briand  PERIOD

Gharib said that she was motivated to apply for the funding because she believes that BSG represents student interests and that the student body has been dissatisfied with recent concerts planned by the EBoard including last years spring concert featuring Maryland rapper IDK PERIOD

BSG is moving ahead with its plans for the concert which is tentatively planned for the first weekend in April PERIOD Gharib formed a planning committee this week which includes class council programming directors who also serve on the EBoard PERIOD

Were all meeting tomorrow afternoon to make a list of our top three to five artists Gharib said PERIOD And then were sending that off to the booking agent tomorrow PERIOD Hopefully we will have someone booked by next week. as BSG moves forward with its plans the EBoards leadership is attempting to restore its role on campus PERIOD The EBoards two cochairs are elected by Bowdoin students PERIOD The rest of the board is composed of the four class council programming directors and a number of members selected via an application process PERIOD EBoard cochair Alex Tesson  feels that the boards disorganization over the past few years placed this years board in a difficult position in planning this years concerts PERIOD

I really enjoyed working with them Tesson said of last years board members PERIOD But they kind of handed us a pile of sticks to build a house. as a result Tesson said planning the fall concertwhich brought Florida rapper Cochise to campuswas much more lastminute than it had been in the past PERIOD

The EBoards plans for the future remain unclear PERIOD Tesson said that he hopes the EBoard can bring a separate event to campus in the spring but that the group may also choose to wait for the fall before planning a new event PERIOD

Tesson said he felt betrayed by Gharib and Student Activities Director Nate Hintze PERIOD He said Gharib did not communicate with him about the idea that BSG would run the spring concert before she proposed it to the SAFC PERIOD

Gharib Tesson and EBoard cochair Kelvin Welbeck  had a conversation on Thursday which Tesson said was unproductive PERIOD

The issue isnt that BSG is running the Spring Concert Tesson said PERIOD For us the issue is the fact that it happened completely behind our backs. both Gharib and Tesson said Hintze suggested to Gharib that BSG put on the Spring Concert instead of the EBoard because of the EBoards failure to submit its budget on time PERIOD Tesson said that Hintze had not informed him of this prior to the decision to move responsibility to BSG PERIOD

Hintze said that his offices role is to implement student decisions not guide them PERIOD

I mentioned to Gharib that the EBoard had yet to submit a budget PERIOD And she asked if she could. it doesnt matter to me who gets the budget Hintze said PERIOD Its up to the SAFC to determine which group they think is  the best fit for the concert  Im happy to work with either group. tesson however was unconvinced of Hintzes claims of neutrality PERIOD

Hintze seems to encourage this change in responsibility Tesson said PERIOD Which feels like a real stab in the back from Hintze and Gharib PERIOD Seeming to orchestrate all of this without reaching out to us seems to have been a very intentional ploy to exclude us from the whole process. gharib said that she sees the change in this years concert as temporary and expressed her hope that the SAFC and the EBoard can work together to rebuild studentplanned concerts at the College PERIOD

There needs to be some sort of restructuring that goes on she said PERIOD

For now Gharib is focused on bringing a successful spring concert to campus PERIOD

I feel confident that the number of people and the people who are working on planning this will be able to put on a good concert she said PERIOD

Hintze says that Student Activities is prepared to support BSG as it works to plan the concert in the next two months PERIOD He pointed out that current EBoard members are already familiar with concert planning logistics whereas BSG members are new to concert planning PERIOD

I think those are new roles for members of the BSG to step into and learn about what that all entails he said PERIOD

BSGs control of the Spring Concert is for now limited to this spring and will not extend to next years concerts PERIOD

If this whole thing means that the EBoard is in hibernation for the spring thats fine Tesson said who along with Welbeck will be at Bowdoin and on the EBoard next year PERIOD It makes me more excited for next year. advertisement
