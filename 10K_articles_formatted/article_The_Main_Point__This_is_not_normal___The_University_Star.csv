8555,2023-09-13,"theMain Point is an opinion written collectively byThe University StarsEditorial Board PERIOD Opinions expressed are not necessarily those of our entire publication PERIOD



Two weeks ago  students and two teachers were killed during a shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde Texas PERIOD At the time of writing this editorial there have been  mass shootings in the U.S PERIOD since then leaving dozens killed or wounded and millions wondering when the cycle will end PERIOD

Although we may offer our support to the grieving communities in the form of thoughts and prayers or blood and money donations our response does not lead to meaningful change without productive government action PERIOD

Legislators at both the federal and state level talk in circles about school safety and mental health and these are important topics to consider PERIOD However we believe these conversations deter from the fact that no place is seemingly sacred PERIOD

If we have learned anything from Americas long history of gun violence it is that tragedies like the ones that occurred in Uvalde at an elementary school Tulsa at a hospital and Buffalo at a supermarket can happen anywhere at any time PERIOD

After Uvalde our state leaders once again called for solutions such as arming teachers and installing bullet proof windows PERIOD However with an understanding that the venue for these acts of violence is not limited to schools there must come a point when we stop blaming frivolous causes and start focusing on the common denominator in all of these cases the gun PERIOD

From our earliest days of schooling we are drilled on how to stay safe if a gunman were to enter our school PERIOD We are trained to hide under desks in a dark classroom and to remain silent PERIOD After  years of these drills we who attend university find ourselves in unfamiliar water PERIOD

We attend classes in unlocked buildings with classroom doors that are often propped open PERIOD Upon entering teaching theaters we take note of exits in the event we would need to escape PERIOD Similarly Americans find themselves routing exits in malls movie theaters hospitals and concert venues PERIOD This is not normal PERIOD

It is clear to us that gun access and restrictions play a large part in the prevalence of gun violence in the U.S PERIOD Research by one of our University Star editors shows that when comparing accumulated data of school shooting location since  to the populations of each state the deep south where the attitude toward gun restrictions is largely laissez faire is shown to have the greatest ratio of school shootings per capita PERIOD Alternatively states in the northeast have had little to no school shootings in the past decade PERIOD These states are largely characterized by advocacy for gun restrictions PERIOD

Our editorial board is horrified that gun violence in the U.S PERIOD has become such a common issue PERIOD Parents should not be afraid to drop off their kids at school and students should not have doubts about their safety in the classroom PERIOD No one should have to worry about getting shot every time they step outside of their home PERIOD

We understand that the repetitiveness of the words mass shooting being in the news can lead to feelings of numbness and hopelessness PERIOD We know that some people may begin to dismiss this kind of news since it happens so often PERIOD As student journalists and members of the editorial board who often do not have the option to look the other way we urge those people to keep paying attention PERIOD

Some members of our own Texas State community experienced their own devastation when the Uvalde shooting happened PERIOD Like them and like you members of our board have loved ones who attend and teach in public schools PERIOD Just because you are not directly affected by such a tragedy that does not mean those close to you and around you feel the same PERIOD

Although we do not report directly from the sources of these events we start our own discussions with you our readers and the students of Texas State to listen to what you have to say on the matter PERIOD

We know that other members of our university community feel the same frustrations and fears we do PERIOD We understand that there is not one quick solution to Americas gun violence problem but we are convinced that some form of action and gun regulation is long overdue PERIOD
