It isnt often when I can say that I have found a new favorite musical PERIOD In fact I am extremely stubborn and will subject any play or musical to harsh critique PERIOD However I met my match while watching the Theatre Department and Mask  Hammers production of The Drowsy Chaperone. not only was I pleasantly delighted by the casting the entire premise of the show and the acting of the individual students but I was won over by about the fifth minute of the show PERIOD I will admit I was dubious first PERIOD Not to give away the entire show but it begins with a narrator on a darkened stage PERIOD I couldnt see anything and I was confused which made me not too happy PERIOD However once the lights came up and I figured out what was going on as did the various other slow viewers I fell in love PERIOD

The Drowsy Chaperone tells the story of a man Tony Ruperto recently divorced and somewhat lonely who is listening to his favorite musical The Drowsy Chaperone. as he tells the story and listens to the record of the show the audience is pulled into the show in front of us PERIOD The narrator occasionally jumps in with the cast to dance and sing all the while maintaining his outsiderness to answer phone calls make jokes or tell us facts about certain roles PERIOD By far the narrator was my favorite character PERIOD I was enamored not only by the entire idea of having a narrator who was outside the cast and acts as an audience member but who was also charming witty and outright adorable PERIOD The record played that tells the story of The Drowsy Chaperone surrounds the marriage of Janet Megan Harrington and Robert Jared Barton Janet is an actress and Robert is a wealthy oil tycoon PERIOD The wedding will take place in one day but Janets producer needs to stop the marriage so that he does not lose his biggest star PERIOD The producer Feldzieg Dominick Gaudosio is followed by his girlfriend Kitty Kelsey Beck who only wants to be the next biggest star by any means  mind reading dancing singing whatever it takes PERIOD Robert is joined by his best friend and best man George Mark Durkee and acts as a charming and suave male lead PERIOD Janet on the other hand is a beautiful talented and somewhat naive young woman who yearns only to know that her intended truly loves her PERIOD Additional characters were Aldolpho the infamous lover Jared Gates and the drowsyalcoholic chaperone herself Kimberly Berg PERIOD

Getting away from my love for the narrator I thoroughly enjoyed each of the other characters in their own light PERIOD Each individual from the leading lady Janet who sings while drinking water down to the butler Underling Colin Larnerd stole my heart PERIOD Best of all the male leads were featured just as much as the female leads something that is somewhat hard to find in musicals PERIOD Even better Robert and George had a tap dance duet that won the heart of every woman in the audience PERIOD Any man that can dance is definitely in my book of favorites PERIOD

The only lamentable part of the show that I had was that the songs were somewhat forgettable PERIOD With the exception of Show Off I could not for the life of me hum any song from the show PERIOD That is not to say that they were performed anything less than spectacular but just that none of them particularly blew me away PERIOD What did knock me off my feet however was the extreme skill that each actor and actress showed on stage PERIOD At one point Barton is on skates PERIOD At another part the record skips which is shown by the entire cast in perfect sync repeating the exact same motion and song clip PERIOD Even without the one token person in the audience who laughs too loudly at everything the crowd was uproarious time and again PERIOD Overall I would highly recommend this show preferably with the SUCO cast to any student PERIOD As I even saw from multiple Facebook statuses Im not even a fan of musicals but I actually liked this
