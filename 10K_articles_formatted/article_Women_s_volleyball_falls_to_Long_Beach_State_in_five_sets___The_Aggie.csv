The secondlargest crowd ever to watch a UC Davis womens volleyball match came to the Pavilion on Saturday in the hope that they may leave having witnessed history PERIOD

The Aggies jumped out to a  advantage against No PERIOD  Long Beach State moving within one set of claiming their firstever home Big West Conference win PERIOD

Then history repeated itself PERIOD

The 49ers rallied to take the final three sets defeating UC Davis     and  in front of an announced crowd of  PERIOD

Honestly I feel very proud of our team said head coach Jamie Holmes PERIOD Were doing some things a lot better then we were doing before PERIOD I think it shows a lot of character and a lot of strength for our team to come back every day and work on the things that we need to work on. senior outside hitter Renee Ibekwe led the Aggies with  kills and  digs PERIOD Junior libero Avreeta Singh tallied  digs and recorded four aces PERIOD

UC Davis falls to  with the loss while Long Beach improves to  PERIOD The Aggies are  in Big West play while Long Beach moves to  PERIOD

The Aggies wasted little time in making a firstset statement jumping out to a  advantage PERIOD UC Davis pushed its lead as far as  before Long Beach came back to tie things up  PERIOD

Ibekwes ace put the Aggies up  before freshman Katie Denny finished things off for UC Davis PERIOD

One and twopoint advantages were traded for most of the second set PERIOD With things tied at  points apiece the Aggies then scored four consecutive points en route to eventually winning the set PERIOD Junior Carson Lowdens block clinched to set and a  lead PERIOD

Then it was the 49ers turn PERIOD

After a pair of backandforth sets Long Beach won the next two by a combined  points to tie things at  PERIOD

Im disappointed on how we let up a little bit in the middle of the game Holmes said PERIOD But thats something thats a work in progress PERIOD Well identify that issue and well definitely work on it in practice. uC Davis got off to a  start in the fifth set but then Long Beach scored seven of the next eight points to build an  lead PERIOD

The Aggies fought back scoring five of the sets final nine points but it wasnt enough to hold off the 49ers PERIOD

The most important thing to us is that were playing to our potential playing up to our abilities Holmes said PERIOD I think in terms of Xs and Os in volleyball and the skills that are being executed I think theyre doing a great job. im definitely proud of the way they came back. the Aggies will face Cal Poly in hopes of their first Big West win of the season on Friday in San Luis Obispo Calif PERIOD They will then travel to UC Santa Barbara to take on the Gauchos on Saturday PERIOD
