Ever since she was cast in a television pilot for PBS in fifth grade Brenna Hill knew she was destined to perform PERIOD

She grew up in Denver where her father was involved in the local theatrical community PERIOD With his encouragement Brenna started acting at a young age continued performing in the community and at school and eventually she was president of her high schools chapter of the International Thespian Society PERIOD

She chose to study theatre performance at the University of NebraskaLincoln where her grandparents had also studied PERIOD

I love the theatre program here Hill said PERIOD Not only has the faculty helped me grow immensely as a performer but I have also met some of my best friends through the classes Ive taken and the shows Ive been in. during her first year at UNL Hill worked behind the scenes of all the mainstage productions like most freshmen PERIOD Her first performance in Lincoln was through the New Artists Festival an annual Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film JCSTF event that showcases student playwrights and performers PERIOD

The next year Hill landed her first major role in a mainstage production PERIOD She played the titular character Silence in Silence which is about a 14yearold Viking prince who didnt know he was actually a girl PERIOD The show was directed by Dennis Henry a second year masters student and featured a cast of mostly seniors PERIOD Hill said the older cast helped to guide her through her performance and gave her a lot of useful advice about performance as they all had much more experience than she did at the time PERIOD

Hill has performed  roles through the JCSTF including Sissy Wilde in Unity  Jess in The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Abridged Nurse in Medea and Ruth in Blithe Spirit. she is also involved in Lazzi the campus improv troupe as she hopes to get involved in improv and sketch comedy after graduation PERIOD

Of all my peers in the JCSTF Brenna is one of few who is constantly working on a show said Emma Gruhl a fellow theatre student and one of Hills best friends PERIOD I have endless respect for Brenna because of how many projects she fearlessly tackles. during the summers Hill stayed in Lincoln to continue performing PERIOD She was able to start earning points towards joining the Actors Equity Association through her work in Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike with the Nebraska Repertory Theatre PERIOD She also has performed at the Haymarket Theatre and was involved in the Melodramas at Mahoney State Park through which she performed a series of comedies nearly every day of the summer PERIOD

Now as Hill prepares to graduate in two weeks she is capping off her college theatre career by directing Smudge through Theatrix the studentrun theatre company PERIOD This is her first time directing a fulllength play but she said the talented cast and production team have made it such an enjoyable experience for her PERIOD

Smudge is a dark comedy written by Rachel Axler whose television credits include Parks and Recreation New Girl and How I Met Your Mother. the play tells the story of a newlywed couple whose baby is born with severe birth defects PERIOD While the father grows close to the child and learns to love it unconditionally the mother suffers severe postpartum depression and wants to kill the baby PERIOD

I read the play in one of my classes last semester and just fell in love with the humor and the characters Hill said PERIOD I feel like its so typical for plays to show a loving mother and an estranged father so I was intrigued at how this flipped the stereotypical roles. the cast features sophomore theatre performance majors Ciara Hergott Hunter Mruz and JCSTF alum Luke Glassma PERIOD

Hill is used to performing with these students so she said it was strange to no longer be on an equal plane with them PERIOD After getting used to her new role in the production process she began to learn a lot about acting through directing PERIOD By instructing the cast she said she gained a better understanding of what is expected of actors and what she can do in the future to please directors PERIOD

Brenna is such a blast to work with Mruz said PERIOD She has a sense of humor that allows us to play and have fun during rehearsals while still getting work done PERIOD I couldnt have asked for a better director to work with on this show. although she loves directing Hill plans to focus on performing after graduation PERIOD She is moving to Chicago to audition for Second City and dreams of living in New York one day and performing on Saturday Night Live PERIOD

I love the freedom of comedy she said PERIOD In film theres so much pressure to look a certain way to get parts but with comedy its just about who you are PERIOD Ive learned so much about myself through the characters Ive played and I cant wait to spend the rest of my life bringing people joy through performance. artsdailynebraskan.com
