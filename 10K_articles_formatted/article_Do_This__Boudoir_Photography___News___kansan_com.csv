Sara poses in just her Marine Corps blouse PERIOD

I like to do things that scare me PERIOD Ive joined the Marine Corps repelled off buildings jumped off cliffs and most recently taken boudoir photos PERIOD

I heard about boudoir photography from a season four episode of Sex and the City in which Samantha decides to take nude photos to look back on PERIOD The idea sounded intimidating to me until recently when I read an ABC News story about the intimate photography sessions becoming a trend PERIOD One photographer in the story said  percent of the brides she worked with have booked boudoir sessions PERIOD

I found three photographers in Lawrence who take boudoir photos OhSnapPhotography Chelsea Donoho and Atomic Photography PERIOD The average price was  PERIOD I decided on OhSnapPhotography because Ive had good experiences with its photo booths and event photos in the past PERIOD

Ailecia Ruscin the owner of OhSnapPhotography arrived at my house at  a.m. but my nervousness began much earlier PERIOD I kept wondering how I should answer the door PERIOD It was like that moment in movies when the woman says shes going to  and the man tries to decide whether this means he should take off his pants or not PERIOD I decided to take my pants off PERIOD

Ruscin put me at ease by giving good direction and constantly asking for my approval PERIOD She told me she would take several hundred photos   to be exact  and I would pick  photos for her to edit PERIOD She would then give me all of the edited and unedited images on a disc which I could print or publish PERIOD

We took several pictures in  which Ruscin said are flattering for every body PERIOD In one such pose I lie on the bed pushing my chest out and put my feet in the air PERIOD Afterward we took fun photos PERIOD In one I put on my Marine Corps blouse PERIOD In another I wore apple print galoshes PERIOD

I saw the photos the next day when Ruscin uploaded them to a password protected page on her website www.ohsnaphoto.com PERIOD They were beautiful artistic and classy PERIOD The images gave me just as much confidence as any cliff Ive ever jumped off of or building Ive repelled down PERIOD
