I didnt grow up a fan of motorsports and always thought NASCAR  an organization Ive never been particularly fond of  was the only major organization PERIOD Recently Netflixs Drive to Survive Formula One F1 TV show got me into the sport and F1 PERIOD Around the same time Netflix added a movie about two reallife F1 drivers and their pursuit for glory and legacy that came out in  called Rush. ive always been a big car guy PERIOD I know years makes models and who was doing what where when certain designs rolled off the production line PERIOD In fact the laptops given to us by Knox County Schools my freshman year of high school likely had more time spent on car websites looking at vintage musclesports cars than the subjects of many of my classes PERIOD While I dont know a thing about fixing them or working on them I have always admired cars that are equal parts beauty and power PERIOD When I found out about F1 the gorgeous locations they race at and the incredible cars they raced in I fell in love almost immediately PERIOD At the same time watching Rush went from being a possibility to an absolute certainty PERIOD

Directed by Ron Howard the film follows Niki Lauda and James Hunt during the most eventful years of their career and relationshiprivalry PERIOD Its chock full of highoctane moments where race car drivers are flying on various treacherous tracks while vying for the immortality that can only be had by true champions and daredevils PERIOD

With all those great racing moments there are also a lot of interesting and thoughtful personal insights into the lives of the films two racers  especially when it comes to Lauda fighting back from a neardeath experience and for Hunt when detailing the nomadic nature of his life PERIOD

The trailer for the movie sells the film as a racing and car movie but again do not let that fool you PERIOD

One of the major things to take away from the film is that it is a huge backing for Chris Hemsworths acting chops PERIOD In the film Hemsworth plays Hunt and really gets into the nitty gritty of working through the complex life Hunt had and the difficulty he seemed to have in effectively connecting to his partners PERIOD Hunt was a huge personality that everyone loved but it was also very clear that Hunt seemed to have trouble sharing his innermost feelings PERIOD Giving those around him an amazing party or adventure but not quite always giving them the whole person that he was PERIOD This cost Hunt relationships and perhaps also prevented him from reaching true satisfaction and solace with himself PERIOD But thats also me playing psychiatrist and I got my degree in public relations so do with that as you may PERIOD

If you are looking for a film that is as thrilling as it is a deep study into what lengths people will go to win Rush is the movie for you PERIOD

There was a saying for soldiers in WWI something along the lines that they will never grow old PERIOD While I am by no means comparing F1 racing to war the racers who win and have lasting legacies in the sport truly are eternal PERIOD

The Laudas the Hunts the Hamiltons and the Schumachers PERIOD They and those of the like are forever young PERIOD
