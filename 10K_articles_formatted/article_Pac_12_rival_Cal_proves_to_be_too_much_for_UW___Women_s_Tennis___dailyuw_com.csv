The Washington womens tennis team dropped its first match of the season Saturday afternoon losing to Pac12 rival California  in Berkeley Calif PERIOD

The Huskies were outmatched by Cals roster which is filled with allconference selections and ranked players PERIOD UW head coach Jill Hultquist admitted Cal was the better team PERIOD

We knew going in that they were a highquality team Hultquist said PERIOD We knew we were going to have to play our best tennis and we had some bad matchups. the Golden Bears clinched the match after Maegan Manasse beat junior Natali Coronel   PERIOD After Coronel lost the remaining matches in play were abandoned leaving four matches without final results PERIOD

After clinching the win for the Huskies on Friday sophomore Grace Ysidora lost to Cals Denise Starr   PERIOD Starr is the highest ranked singles player for the Golden Bears proving to be a tough match for Ysidora after her hard fought match against UNLV PERIOD

Junior Riko Shimizu drew a bad matchup against the Golden Bears losing to Klara Fabikova   PERIOD Fabikova moved to No PERIOD  singles after playing No PERIOD  a season ago and her size advantage proved to be too much for the junior from Ojai Calif PERIOD

This matchup for her wasnt very good Hultquist said PERIOD Cal has a lot of depth any of those players can play number one or number two so its tough. the Huskies once again dropped the doubles point but Hultquist thinks the overall effort was improved from Friday PERIOD Senior Andjela Nemcevic and junior Julija Lukac dropped their second doubles match of the weekend losing  to Lynn Chi and Fabikova PERIOD After giving the Huskies their lone doubles win against UNLV Coronel and Ysidora lost to Starr and Zsofi Susanyi  PERIOD

When the Golden Bears clinched the doubles point sophomore Elianne DouglasMiron and Shimizu led Anett Schutting and Manasse  providing one of the few highlights for the Huskies on Saturday PERIOD

The Huskies return home to Seattle on Saturday night and will play their first home match against BYU on Friday at  p.m PERIOD Despite the loss the Huskies still earned one ranked win over the weekend and stand at  on the season PERIOD But they are still missing the win over Cal that they are hoping to get this season PERIOD

If one our goals is to beat Cal this year this showed us what we have to work on Hultquist said PERIOD Our girls are good players but we see the things we have to get better at. reach reporter Erik Erickson at sportsdailyuw.com PERIOD Twitter ErikErickson
