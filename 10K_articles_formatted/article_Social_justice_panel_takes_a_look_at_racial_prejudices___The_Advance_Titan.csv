The social justice panel Navigating the Inequalities Racism and Social Justice in the twenty-first Century opened up a discussion with current UW Oshkosh AfricanAmerican students to discuss the question Are racial prejudices still affecting lives

The event took place on Feb PERIOD  in Sage Hall and was just one of the many events put on by the Black Student Union in celebration of Black History Month PERIOD

Director of Student Achievement Services and coadviser of the Black Student Union Byron Adams said this event honors the history and ongoing experience of AfricanAmericans PERIOD
This is a way to commemorate Black History Month and reflect on the past as well as delve into current issues Adams said PERIOD It allows for us to celebrate all that is our diversity. adams said it is valuable for people to have an understanding of cultures different from their own PERIOD

As we look back at diversity and inclusive excellence these events allow us to appreciate various topics and populations Adams said PERIOD By communicating with people of different backgrounds and being exposed to their cultures it makes for a better student and person in general. adams said there is still a lot of work to be done to end racism but becoming accustomed to other cultures is beneficial PERIOD

The first step to overcoming racism is understanding the history Adams said PERIOD If everyone made an effort to understand and expose themselves to different cultures it would be a step in the right direction. adams said the conversation drew attention to the current reality of AfricanAmerican students and people of color PERIOD

The discussion surrounding the AfricanAmerican student experience on campus equity and diversity was very insightful and sparked a great deal of indepth discussion and brought to light how students of color particularly AfricanAmericans are feeling on campus in the community and in general Adams said PERIOD

The discussion facilitator and UWO history professor Jeffrey Pickron said the event was significant because everyone got a chance to share their perspective PERIOD

It gave students the chance to express their viewpoints regarding racism in a setting that includes students faculty staff and administrators Pickron said PERIOD

Pickron said this event was a sort of followup to last semesters celebration of Black Thursdays fiftieth anniversary one of the most important events in UWO history PERIOD

At a time  when AfricanAmericans were beginning to have a presence on campus they articulated a number of concerns about the way AfricanAmericans were treated unequally on campus and in the community Pickron said PERIOD I wanted to come back to some of those original areas of concern to see what todays students had to say to see if weve made progress or if we still have work to do. pickron said as the majority on campus white students need to make a particular effort to understand the experience of students of color and be actively engaged in understanding and working against racism PERIOD

This event demonstrated some of the complexity and subtlety of contemporary racism Pickron said PERIOD I hope the value of it was to expose some of the microaggressions that occur every day to show how they impact students of color and how we can all be more mindful of one another. pickron said it should be a primary goal to work toward true equality PERIOD

Racism is still Americas original sin and a problem that we must continue to fight Pickron said PERIOD It might have become more subtle and complex in some ways but it is still present and pernicious. news
