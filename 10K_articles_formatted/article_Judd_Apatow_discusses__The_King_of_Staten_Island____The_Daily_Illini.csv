The King of Staten Island starring Pete Davidson is set to release on June  PERIOD

By Jared Ebanks Assistant Features Editor June  

With the premiere of his movie The King of Staten Island approaching on June  releasing on demand director and writer Judd Apatow sat down for a virtual roundtable with college newspapers from across the country on June  PERIOD

The King of Staten Island stars Saturday Night Live talent Pete Davidson alongside Bill Burr and Marissa Tomei PERIOD Set in Davidsons hometown of Staten Island the movie follows Scott Davidsons character around the forgotten borough exploring a deeply personal and darkly funny journey based on Davidsons actual life PERIOD

Davidsons father firefighter Scott Davidson passed away when responding to the World Trade Center attack in  PERIOD The movie explores the ways in which Scott copes with losing his father at a young age and a number of decisions that dig into a deeper and mentally depressing hole PERIOD

Apatow has successfully directed and written productions that blend social issues such as mental health seamlessly with comedy PERIOD Davidsons character feels like life cheated him out of growing up with his father PERIOD Scott is comparable to a lot of millennials and the GenZ population PERIOD When other people around him attempt to bring him up he naturally pulls himself back down PERIOD

The entirety of the movie is shot and based in Staten Island PERIOD A native to Long Island New York Apatow felt at home filming in the lost borough for the first time since the early 80s PERIOD The borough created an authentic and visible theme throughout the film encapsulating the tone accents and even reallife locations such as the famous pizzeria Deninos PERIOD



Theres this certain vibe to Staten Island that is not like the other boroughs its not like anywhere else in the country Apatow said PERIOD Its a bit of a strange place because theres nothing there that would make anyone visit if you didnt have friends or family there. davidson accompanied Apatow and the production design team during location scouting pointing out landmarks and shooting locations that he resonated and felt was authentic to the borough PERIOD

Its almost like a land without visitors and the people who live there dont leave a ton and go to Manhattan in a surprising way Apatow said PERIOD It is its own bubble and its own culture PERIOD We felt that if we shoot the entire movie there then maybe wed get a truthful look into what it feels like to live there. the King of Staten Island is unique in that it is one of the few movies that star the actor that the film is based upon PERIOD Apatow is known for telling the stories of characters who are stuck in a rut due to the continuous negative choices they make PERIOD All three writers Apatow Davidson and Dave Sirus outlined for months crafting this fictional world that created elements from Petes reallife that could further inspire the story and other characters PERIOD

It only worked because Pete was so brave to share it all with us Apatow said PERIOD We were trying to make a fictional movie that was emotionally truthful PERIOD So even though most of the movie is made up and didnt happen when it was over you would feel like you really got to know Pete. sacrifice is a prominent theme throughout the film PERIOD In the second act Petes character is introduced to the firefighters and firehouse that hold key information and experiences about his father PERIOD Terry Quinn who worked alongside FDNY member John Sorrentino was a close friend to Petes father when they worked in Brooklyn Heights together PERIOD Quinn worked as a consultant for the film ensuring the authenticity of the men and women who protect the city PERIOD Sorrentino also accompanied Apatow and Davidson on a day in the life experience of a firefighter during the filming of the movie PERIOD

I said to one of the firefighters once Is most of it boring Is most of it like a pain You get sent to someones house to get their cat or somebody fell or something like that. and he said I know this sounds corny but we just really like helping people Apatow said PERIOD

Few films attempt to address the serviceminded individuals in our community that protect and serve us PERIOD The lack of attention these men and women in service receive was a motivating factor to Apatow when piecing the film together PERIOD

We all move through the world and we just assume these people will help us but we dont really think much about them PERIOD Theyre just there I think theyre taken for granted most of the time but yet if you call a firefighter right now theyll run into your burning house Apatow said PERIOD

The struggles of todays generation continues to inspire the unique subject matter of Apatows catalog PERIOD Social media is a platform that Apatow didnt have to grapple with as a young comedian and director PERIOD These stark comparisons sparked an interesting dialogue between Apatow and Davidsons respective upbringings PERIOD

What I talk about with Pete a lot is that when I was first starting I was a kid and I lived with Adam Sandler in an apartment and we were in our early 20s and no one paid any attention to us PERIOD There was no internet that we knew about and we were trying to learn how to be comedians and we were young people wandering around the world with no one tracking us nobody judging us we didnt know what anyone else was doing PERIOD And I think it was a much less stressful young persons life than what it is now where everyone in a way is starring in their own Instagram tv show Apatow said PERIOD

Apatow hopes that the complexities of each characters relationship with the next as well as their individual struggles resonates with viewers PERIOD These societal issues seem to pop up in each of Apatows films exploring the human struggle as both darkly reflective and comedic PERIOD

Personally I think everybodys a lost soul PERIOD Everybody in the world is just trying to get through the day make their life work make their relationships work be good parents or be good kids or good friends and that thats very difficult a lot of the time PERIOD I have a lot of compassion for the basic human struggle but I think its also very funny Apatow said PERIOD
