Generally clear PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The oftenquoted proverb stating  dates back to the 1300s  the time of Chaucer PERIOD

While most of us would hardly consider the academicrelated part of each semester as a good thing the stress level is significantly less even during midterms than anything near the hysteria we feel around final exam week PERIOD

Unfortunately this horrific time is upon us and the  part of our semester has come to an end PERIOD For many of our classes a significant portion of the class grade relies upon our performance on these tests and somehow the material seems to dissolve from memory each time we start a new section PERIOD If you are anything like me a lot of review and brushing up on this semesters information will be required to get decent grades

Not only do we have the actual final exams to study for in each class but we are also assigned final projects papers or other assignments deemed necessary for course completion by our instructors PERIOD

By now weve all completed at least a semester of college and know which are effective study tactics and which arent PERIOD It varies depending on the person whether we need background noise or complete silence to concentrate PERIOD Many people who find it too distracting to even study at home PERIOD The nearest library or Starbucks is where to go if any studying will get done for them PERIOD Personally my bedroom is offlimits for studying it becomes too convenient to lie down and  take a snooze I know that from experience PERIOD But hey it may work for you PERIOD

There are also a lot of students accustomed to using  to cram in their study sessions due to unfortunate time crunches plaguing most of us PERIOD Before college we had all heard of university students staying up all night fueled by coffee or Adderall with the material fresh in their brain for the mornings exam PERIOD For any of you who have actually done this its not as  as it seems PERIOD

Tests on the subject have shown that allnighters actually decrease health and test scores PERIOD Why make your body or grades take a hit when nothing is truly gained

In the studies conducted by an associate professor at St PERIOD Lawrence University  students GPAs were compared to their study habits PERIOD Twothirds of the students who frequently pulled allnighters throughout the semester proved to have lower GPAs than those who reportedly pulled only one PERIOD

Similarly the journal SLEEP did a study on the effects of sleep deprivation to the human body PERIOD Lack of sleep is associated with side effects like delayed reaction and tendency to make mistakes two detrimental factors to ones exam performance PERIOD In addition a portable heart monitor tested adults following varying amounts of sleep and found that when adults receive little sleep at night they experienced much faster heartbeats the next day PERIOD Builtup sleep deficit is also known to stress the heart significantly PERIOD

College students are already crunched for time to fulfill class requirements throughout the semester because of important things like our jobs fraternities or sororities and of course our social lives PERIOD Add this to the increased amount of finals work given in each class and multiple tests asking us to recover everything weve learned this semester and yikes Thats enough to make anyone consider taking up meditation PERIOD

Find what personally works for you and give yourself enough time to feel confident in your testtaking abilities PERIOD Theres nothing worse than walking into an exam room panicked and underprepared PERIOD Also for some of you these are your final finals and everything collegerelated is nearing the end these tests play a big role in your upcoming graduation PERIOD

Sleep deprivation can only enhance your stress so dont limit yourself within this next week or two and have to resort to colleges underrated study tactic PERIOD Sleep will be your biggest ally in conquering these exams PERIOD Summer is a stones throw away now Pirates There will be plenty of reasons to stay up all night if you choose studying not included PERIOD
