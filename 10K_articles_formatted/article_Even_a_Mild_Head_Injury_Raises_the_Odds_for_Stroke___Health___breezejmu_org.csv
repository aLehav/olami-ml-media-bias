WEDNESDAY Sept PERIOD   HealthDay News  Any head injury  even a mild one  raises a persons risk of later having an ischemic stroke PERIOD

Having multiple injuries increases that risk even more so than the severity of a single traumatic brain injury TBI researchers report PERIOD

Our study found that those who experience two or more head injuries including even mild head injuries are at higher risk of subsequent ischemic stroke said study author Dr PERIOD Holly Elser a neurology resident at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia PERIOD The findings underscore the importance of public health interventions to reduce the risk of head injury as well as measures aimed at stroke prevention among individuals with a prior head injury. an ischemic stroke the most common type of stroke is caused by a blockage in the vessels that supply blood to the brain PERIOD TBIs can be mild moderate or severe PERIOD

To study the connection with stroke the researchers analyzed data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ARIC study of more than  U.S PERIOD adults PERIOD The diverse group had not had a head injury or stroke when the study began in  PERIOD

More than  of those people did experience a head injury during the following 30year time period about  of which were mild PERIOD

More than  had an ischemic stroke PERIOD

The investigators found that those who had a head injury had a  increased risk of ischemic stroke PERIOD Those with two or more head injuries had a  increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to those with no head injury PERIOD Age race or sex didnt matter PERIOD

This underscores the importance of preventing head injuries according to the study authors PERIOD

The findings were presented Tuesday at the American Neurological Association annual meeting in Philadelphia PERIOD Findings presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peerreviewed journal PERIOD

TBIs may increase the risk of stroke by damaging tiny blood vessels in the brain the cells lining those blood vessels and the inner layer of arteries past research has shown PERIOD This damage can block or slow blood flow in the brain PERIOD

Our results emphasize the importance of measures that prevent head injury like always wearing seatbelts in the car and wearing a helmet while biking Elser said PERIOD Our results also suggest that measures to prevent stroke may be especially important in people who have suffered a head injury which could include interventions like lowering blood pressure and cholesterol increasing physical activity and smoking cessation. more information
