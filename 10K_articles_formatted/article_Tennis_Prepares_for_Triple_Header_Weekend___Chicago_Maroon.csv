2240,2022-03-16,"the UChicago tennis teams have a packed weekend as their spring season goes into full swing PERIOD The mens team will have three meets over the weekend with all three happening up north over the state border in Wisconsin PERIOD

They start off this Friday with a matchup with No PERIOD  Gustavus Adolphus College up in West Bend PERIOD With the Chicago mens team ranked fourth in the country it should be a competitive matchup and hopefully the Maroons will be able to come out on top PERIOD Afterward the mens team travels to nearby Janesville to play against its rival Wash U PERIOD Itll be a rematch of when the two schools faced off at the ITA National Team Indoors where the Maroons got the better of the Bears with a score of  PERIOD The UChicago mens tennis team is expecting another competitive feisty match against their rivals PERIOD

To round off the weekend the mens team has a match versus UWWhitewater PERIOD This matchup should be relatively straightforward for the Maroons considering the discrepancy between the two sides and the earlier opponents throughout the weekend PERIOD The Warhawks are unranked and have lost their most recent match against Kalamazoo PERIOD

The team is excited for this challenge of a weekend according to firstyear Justin Lee The team is ready to play biggame tennis and dominate out there over the weekend PERIOD Theyve been working really hard and have a lot of swagger right now because of it. hopefully that hard work and confidence shows up in their matches on the tennis court PERIOD

The womens team only has two matches this weekend instead of three like the mens team PERIOD Their first match of the weekend is this Saturday against Wash U in what is a rematch of their match last weekend PERIOD The Maroons were the victors last week with a comfortable  win in their meet up in Madison PERIOD That last win should give the womens team the confidence it needs to pull off a win against its bitter rival PERIOD Similarly the final match of the weekend is against UWWhitewater which has cracked the top  in the latest poll released PERIOD

These two top25 battles which the UChicago womens team should be favored in will be a good test for the consistency of the womens program and their ability to take care of business in favorable matchups PERIOD Overall it is a packed week for both programs with exciting matchups PERIOD It will be imperative for both teams to show up with the confidence that they need to win and take them to a weekend sweep PERIOD
