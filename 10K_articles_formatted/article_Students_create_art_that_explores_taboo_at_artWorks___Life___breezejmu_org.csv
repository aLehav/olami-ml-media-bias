Derek Niver mixed media  Senior graphic design major

Are you remembering it Or are you remembering yourself remember it

The origin of myths are often so ambiguous that we dont think about them however senior graphic design major Derek Niver delves into and explores the concept in his collection PERIOD

After reading the poem Mythopoeia by J.R.R PERIOD Tolkien Niver became interested in illustrating the relationship between myth and memory PERIOD

Mythopoeia talks about inventing and stretching truths to create myths I took it as maybe thats what early people did Niver said PERIOD There wasnt a lot of technology or ways to hold people accountable for what they see or what happens to them. nivers work is complex but dreamy it features intricate ink drawings of large mystical animals with minute details for each feather and fur coat PERIOD Ink drawings on wood slabs are severe and elaborate but remain soft and whimsical against untreated wood PERIOD Nivers first pyrography or woodburning piece is also on display a beautiful woman lying on her side PERIOD Her face is detailed but the rest of her fades into vague shapes and lines PERIOD

Some parts are detailed and vivid and others are lost in the grain the grain of life Niver joked PERIOD

Paige Ramsey digital prints  Senior studio art major

I find the myths and legends concerning .. PERIOD gods and goddesses very fascinating. senior studio art major Paige Ramseys fascination with mythology began years ago with The Metamorphoses by Ovid PERIOD

I took Latin in high school and there was this big collection of poetry about Roman myths thats always been one of my favorites Ramsey said PERIOD I thought it would be really nice to do a series of works inspired by my favorite myths from the book. ramseys works are simple in their execution faceless forms surrounded by faint text sometimes with a small prop indicative of its accompanying myth PERIOD The colors and understated style blended together are cohesive and soothing PERIOD

I decided to start a digital theory using symbolism and simple form to put the points of the story across Ramsey said PERIOD They usually have to do with human folly or not following the rules or love. using figures from a reference site and occasionally real models Ramsey created her collection exclusively in Photoshop although she is a drawing and painting concentrator PERIOD This is Ramseys first showing of her digital work PERIOD

Jeremiah Morris photography  Junior studio art major

I wanted to create a project that would push me to understand myself better as an artist 

Summer vacation is meant to be a time of relaxation and recuperation but Jeremiah Morris kept his photography studies going throughout the 100day long summer PERIOD

Morris a junior studio art major didnt spend his summer taking selfies by the pool PERIOD Instead he planned out  themes he wanted to explore visually he sketched a concept found a model set up a photo shoot and edited photos every day PERIOD

It didnt always go according to plan Morris said PERIOD Sometimes it worked out sometimes it was on a whim. in his collection Morris explores themes like sorrow dreams and insanity. but as his list of themes to tackle got longer things also got weirder with themes like under the rain and ashes. no matter how abstract the themes are the photos are still beautifully executed and convey emotion subtly but effectively PERIOD

Theyre very varied because its such a big project but I was trying to show the ways that I interpret certain emotions and concepts and seeing if I could connect with people on a surrealistic level Morris said PERIOD

Jacqueline Guerrier mixed media  Senior history and studio art double major

What happens when you want to present yourself as something other than human

Jacqueline Guerrier is a furry or an animal enthusiast with a penchant for creating humananimal hybrid identities for herself PERIOD Most people who are familiar with the concept have probably only seen things that present furry culture as freakish or sexual but Guerrier aims to change that PERIOD

For her senior honors project in studio art Guerrier spent a year researching the furry phenomenon and her place within it before sharing it with her peers in brightlycolored naturally cute representations of her and her friends furry personas PERIOD

To the opening of artWorks Guerrier wore a suit of black white and limegreen fur that she created herself PERIOD The suit represents just one of her many personas Jas PERIOD

I have a bunch of ones that I relate to for certain aspects PERIOD This one Sunny is kind of a fashionista Guerrier said pointing to a very chiclooking cartoon pony on the back of a purple denim vest PERIOD

Guerriers collection contained  conbadges or small illustrations of her friends animal alter egos a mask and a painting of a pantherwoman hybrid either standing on allfours or just being a cat PERIOD Her illustrations are cute fun and boldly colorful reminiscent of cartoons from the early 1990s think Thundercats if you must. success An email has been sent to  with a link to confirm list signup PERIOD
