EDITORS NOTE This column has been abridged to fit the space of the newsprint PERIOD You can read the full column along with Owens other works on his blog oshowblog.blogspot.com PERIOD

Facebook Creep has become a term that is recognizable to anyone unfortuante enough to live in the Facebook era PERIOD While I too have an account and have been known to creep from time to time I have noticed that certain people have gone above and beyond the call of creepiness PERIOD

I have categorized them into groups in an attempt to not only expose them for what they are but to warn other members of the Facebook community to consider these descriptions when thinking of their friends chances are you know at least one of them PERIOD

The Photo Creep You have over  photos PERIOD As if that isnt creepy enough you have to be that kid at the party with the camera PERIOD This creep which usually is a girl  but is creepier when its a guy takes it upon themselves to document every single night week or weekend for your specific group of friends PERIOD No one else takes pictures because we all know that no matter how stupid the situation is youre going to force it into some kind of a photo op PERIOD You title your photo albums after lyrics to popular songs like This is why were hot or Fergalicious even though the songs themselves have no relevance to the pictures found within PERIOD

The Wall Creep It is understandable when you receive a random message from a random friend and see that it was sent at  a.m PERIOD A lot of stupid things seem wall postable at  a.m PERIOD on a Saturday PERIOD However this creep chooses instead to post at a time when they can assure you that not only are they completely sober but thinking about you PERIOD Often times this creep will approach you at parties and come up with some kind of stupid inside joke like yelling Shiver Me Timbers like a pirate PERIOD Then when you wake up hung over in the morning and sign on to see whats good with the book they have already posted YARRR SHIVER ME TIMBERS on your wall by  a.m PERIOD

The I havent seen you since grade school Creep I completely forgot you were alive PERIOD I had finally forgotten your name face and how I knew you until you friended me last week PERIOD I havent seen or heard from you since we did the Christmas pageant at church in the third grade  but your convinced we are still close enough to be friends on the book PERIOD If I reject your friend request I run the risk of hurting your feelings which at this point I dont really care about and if I accept God knows how long you will creep on me through the internet PERIOD

The Poke Creep You poke people like it isnt creepy PERIOD Well it is PERIOD Stop PERIOD

The I quit facebook but still creep Creep Whether it was a rough breakup the surfacing of compromising photos graduation or you just couldnt take being on facebook anymore  you decided to call it quits PERIOD You deleted your wall you removed all of your photos and you even removed all information except where youre from and what your name is PERIOD However you continue to creep PERIOD You are the creepiest of the creeps because your lack of participation on Facebook makes you hard to track PERIOD You can creep without detection  and without worrying about covering your tracks PERIOD

The Photo Comment Creep You comment on photos that you arent even in PERIOD You didnt go to the party  and chances are you dont even go to that school but just in case everyone doesnt know that you saw the pictureyou throw a comment underneath it like Lol or Sexxxyy just to remind whoever posted the photo album you still creep on them PERIOD

The BoyfriendGirlfriend I want to know your password creep You demand that you know the password to your boyfriend or girlfriends account PERIOD Thats super creepy PERIOD

The Event creep You invite every single one of your friends even if they go to USC to a party at your house called Big Party. you have invited  people but only  have RSVPd two are your roommates and one is you PERIOD No one wants to go to your stupid parties because they are lame PERIOD However no one really wants to hurt your feelings so we all click Maybe Ill show up knowing damn well we wont PERIOD

The my Facebook picture isnt me creep Whether your picture is Tupac Giselle from Victorias Secret or some fat naked guy with a mullet you should probably just have a picture of yourself PERIOD No one really thinks its funny  we all just assume that it means you have no good pictures of yourself PERIOD You dont really creep anyone outbecause youre just trying to be funny PERIOD But it isnt PERIOD

The Hey I got your screen name from Facebook creep Stop trying to get our relationship from weird casual acquaintance to someone you can talk to on a regular basis PERIOD You didnt have my screen name for a reason PERIOD I only accepted your message request because I couldnt tell who it was by looking at your purposely vague screen name PERIOD Its people like you that are ruining it for everyone PERIOD And now you can look at my away message and find out where I am PERIOD Creep PERIOD
