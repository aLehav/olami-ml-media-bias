7838,2021-02-01,"on Friday Jan PERIOD  the Associated Students Program Board ASPB African Student Programs ASP and HUB Programs collaborated to host the second part of their social justice symposium PERIOD

The event began at  p.m with a brief workshop with Gerry Medina the Leadership and Service Programs Coordinator at UCR PERIOD Music played as people began to enter the Zoom meeting PERIOD Rather than muting all of the participants the first half of the symposium allowed everyone free access to their microphones and video displays PERIOD There were roughly over  people who attended this workshop PERIOD

The workshop was interactive and when Medina was introduced he announced that the purpose of this workshop was to serve as a primer on the concept of social justice and what it means. medina guided the participants through different questions and encouraged people to answer them in the chat PERIOD

In between questions Medina also prepared an activity that would enable participants to check their privileges PERIOD Participants were encouraged to take out a piece of paper and map out their identity by examining which parts of their identities they think about the most and whether those parts granted them some sort of privilege in society PERIOD Medina stated that it was important to understand that Life is difficult for everyone but do you have institutional barriers in society along with those everyday difficulties

After Medinas workshop the Social Justice Symposium ended with a QA lecture with Angela Davis PERIOD Davis a political activist and professor at UC Santa Cruz was a keynote speaker for this event PERIOD Her QA session began at  p.m. and TaNeill M Hope was the first to interview Davis PERIOD In this first half of the lecture Davis revealed that her interest in social justice started when she was very young PERIOD Davis stated I never had an epiphany PERIOD I never made a decision to be involved in these efforts PERIOD It is simply how we must live our lives. when asked how she combats burnout Davis responded I think what has helped me is my sense of being a part of a larger community. she claimed We learn how to think of ourselves primarily as individuals so one of the challenges is to resist that ideological turn. the topic of our current school system was also brought up PERIOD Davis suggested Our system needs to be rehauled revamped and reimagined. davis expressed her excitement over visiting some high schools with social justice embedded into their curriculum and she argued that all schools should do the same PERIOD She firmly believed in education not incarceration and noted that our society needs to shift funding to build better schools and make free quality education available to everyone PERIOD

The questions then turned to current events as Hope asked Davis how we should continue to push against police brutality after the number of protests that arose last year PERIOD Davis was awed by the people who chose to attend protests and to take steps towards progressing the Black Lives Matter movement last year especially at the expense of their own health as the pandemic loomed over the world PERIOD She stated Victories come as a result of people who stood up and resisted and that she imagined that the work weve been doing in the past decades were to prepare for the future. afterwards the conversation transferred to the student QA section PERIOD One participant asked Davis how she dealt with the anxiety of meeting resistance during protests PERIOD Davis replied There have been so many times when I was really scared to death but I learned that one can still act. one student asked how to hold oppressors accountable PERIOD Davis replied that our society impulsively sends people to prison and she argues that this only prevents us from brainstorming better ways to deal with people who have done wrong PERIOD She claims that many people who have been abused want and know how to reeducate abusers PERIOD

The final question came from Dominik Deciga who asked for Davis opinion on social media and performative activism PERIOD Davis replied I dont know whether now is the time to criticize people for their performative activism. however she argued that technology could be useful in bringing attention to a cause especially since it connects us to similar movements around the world PERIOD She claimed We have to use that technology productively and not allow it to use us. both halves of the events were so engrossing and enlightening that they ended up going over time PERIOD There was a lot to cover on the topic of social justice and though Davis was unable to answer everyones questions she made a point to ask the ASPB to email her a copy of the questions so that she could read them PERIOD This symposium was an educational experience and UCR should make an effort to host similar events PERIOD

ASPB will host its next event Mindfulness and Meditating with Raveena on Feb PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD via Zoom PERIOD
