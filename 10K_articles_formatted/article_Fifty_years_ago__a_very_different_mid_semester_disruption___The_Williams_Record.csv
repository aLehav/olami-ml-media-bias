One Wednesday during spring semester the College announced a major disruption to classes for the rest of the school year PERIOD Events in the world beyond the Purple Bubble had rendered it impossible to conduct business as usual PERIOD

But the year was  not  PERIOD And the semester came to an early end not because of a global pandemic but because of a studentled facultyendorsed strike in protest of the Vietnam War PERIOD

In early May students at Williams and other colleges across the country went on strike in protest of the U.S PERIOD invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War PERIOD Fifty years later at a virtual faculty meeting on March  after inperson classes were canceled in light of the COVID19 pandemic President of the College Maud S PERIOD Mandel referred obliquely to the strike PERIOD

The decision that was sent out today is not unprecedented in Williams history but its been  years since a semester was disrupted in this way she said PERIOD

There are several clear differences between the disruption in  and the current one in  PERIOD The  strike was the result of studentled activism rather than a decision made by the administration PERIOD The strike occurred only a few weeks before the end of the semester PERIOD All students could continue living on campus if they wished PERIOD And the College was a very different place it was smaller whiter and almost exclusively male PERIOD

The main source of outrage fueling the  strike was the announcement by President Richard Nixon on April  that the U.S PERIOD had invaded neutral Cambodia PERIOD

When the Cambodian bombing became public it created an almost national outcry in part because Nixon had won his election in part because of a secret plan to secure peace in Vietnam  and here we were involved in extending the war to another supposedly neutral country said George Marcus current professor emeritus and thenassistantprofessor of political science PERIOD

Another cause for unrest was the trial of Bobby Seale a founder of the Black Panther Party whose prosecution many students saw as politically motivated PERIOD On May  students from various colleges including Williams attended a Yale rally to free Seale PERIOD

At a meeting that weekend antiwar organizers called on the crowd of college students to lead strikes at their own institutions PERIOD

On the drive back to Williamstown the students who had attended the rally decided to bring the strike movement to the College said Jim Lobe  PERIOD Once they returned to campus on Sunday night they began making signs and calling meetings to raise student support for the protest PERIOD

We all created a momentum that became pretty irresistible within about  hours Lobe said PERIOD

The tumult increased after the shootings of four unarmed Kent State students by the Ohio National Guard on Monday May  PERIOD

So now theyre killing us Brewster Rhoads  said recalling the sentiment of the time PERIOD It immediately escalated this into Okay the U.S PERIOD government is shooting college students who are fighting the war. its hard to communicate today what that felt like what it meant. this time not even the beautiful Berkshire spring can hold back the stench emanating from our now extended atrocities in Vietnam PERIOD But moral outrage itself is not enough PERIOD Finally the nations campuses must act PERIOD

That afternoon the faculty voted in favor of a twoday strike to all classes and College related activities with plans to reassess on Wednesday PERIOD Roughly  students and faculty packed into Chapin Hall that evening for a campuswide meeting that lasted until  a.m PERIOD The president of College Council shared a statement from President of the College John E PERIOD Sawyer  who decried the war and urged Nixon to take note of students efforts PERIOD

That night students joined thousands of their peers across the country voting overwhelmingly in favor of an indefinite strike PERIOD

This time not even the beautiful Berkshire spring can hold back the stench emanating from our now extended atrocities in Vietnam read an editorial in the Record the next day PERIOD But moral outrage itself is not enough PERIOD Finally the nations campuses must act. in the eyes of Bob Katt  one of the leaders of the strike the primary goals were twofold to send a message to the nations leaders and to free up time for political organizing PERIOD For a lot of people it was This cant just be business as usual Katt said PERIOD That was a very strong feeling. on Wednesday evening the faculty voted to accept the strike PERIOD

The Faculty shares the sense of outrage that has swept campuses across the land at the reescalation of the war in Southeast Asia and the tragic violence it has caused throughout the nation read its resolution PERIOD

Marcus said that the predominantly liberal faculty was even more inclined to do something about this than the students PERIOD The faculty didnt see themselves as separate from the larger public outrage he said PERIOD

Basically wed all had it with Nixon recalled Professor Emeritus of History Peter Frost then an associate dean PERIOD

The faculty offered students three options regarding coursework PERIOD First students could choose to complete their assignments on time even though classes were largely not occurring PERIOD Second seniors could choose to take their classes passfail so that they could stop doing coursework and still graduate on time assuming their prior work in the course was deemed sufficient PERIOD Third all students could defer their work take an incomplete in a course and finish their assignments by Oct PERIOD  to receive credit PERIOD

Not all students supported the strike PERIOD Campus conservatives who supported Nixons tactics criticized the Colleges willingness to give in to progressive student demands PERIOD In a Record oped two students argued By giving its blessing to one side of the issue the College in effect has closed the issue has discouraged any dialogue and it is therefore incumbent upon the College to reestablish that dialogue by instituting a program where proNixon views are presented. in the days and weeks that followed some students left Williamstown for Washington D.C PERIOD to meet with politicians PERIOD Some engaged in activism on other college campuses Rhoads stayed on the floor of his cousins dorm at Smith compiling and disseminating daily news releases about the state of protest in Western Massachusetts PERIOD Others took action from Williamstown PERIOD And many students proceeded as usual completing schoolwork on time and receiving grades as scheduled despite not having class PERIOD

Two main activist groups formed on campus the studentrun Strike Central located at the nowdemolished Seeley House and the professorled Pause for Peace campaign PERIOD

One of the main operations in Strike Central was the effort to shut down Nixons rigged opinion polls PERIOD The Nixon administration purported to hold polls on issues like the presidents handling of the war people could call a specific phone number and register their opinions PERIOD But the phone numbers were sent only to Republican loyalists and the poll results were therefore always skewed toward Nixons interests PERIOD

There was a Williams student in our class whose father was a highplaced administration official Katt said PERIOD The official who did not agree with what was going on with the polls would send the phone numbers to his son who would pass them along to Strike Central PERIOD The Seeley House organizers would then announce the numbers on a college radio network PERIOD

Within an hour or so we would be glutting the secret poll number with students calling in Katt said PERIOD And thats how we shut the polls down PERIOD Because the calls were flooding in on the side of opposition to the war Nixon would close them down PERIOD We shut down I think three or four different numbers that they tried to put out. lobe a Seeley House organizer recalled that the facultyled Pause for Peace was much more topdown than Seeley House PERIOD

Seeley House people who were more I guess socialanarchisticallyinclined didnt really work with the Pause for Peace people Lobe said PERIOD

Pause for Peace led by Marcus called for a nationwide onehour stoppage of work on May  PERIOD It tried to collaborate with labor unions and corporations but encountered significant obstacles PERIOD

Labor unions whatever portion of their membership was drawn from the antiwar movement were at risk of both unemployment but also legal issues  because inasmuch as the unions had signed contracts with various corporations for the terms of work they were worried about being sued by those corporations for breach of contract Marcus said PERIOD Similarly he noted even corporations sympathetic to the antiwar movement worried about being sued by their stockholders PERIOD

Strike posters Tshirts and pamphlets popped up on campus while antiwar music blasted on the Colleges quads PERIOD Jefferson Airplanes  album Volunteers was the soundtrack of that May with lyrics like Look whats happening out in the streets  Got a revolution  Got to revolution. in the midst of this political upheaval Lobe recalled the Colleges formerly rigid social structure temporarily relaxed PERIOD Once things were underway there was  as there has been historically all around the world  a festivallike sense he said noting that clique divisions in the dining halls broke down during the strike PERIOD

While some students such as Katt and Lobe remained holed up in Seeley House for much of the month many others took advantage of the strike period to begin summer break a few weeks early PERIOD As the weather warmed students spent time relaxing in the grass going on road trips to visit friends and taking advantage of the sunny days PERIOD

Often Katt saw his fellow seniors most of whom were taking classes passfail playing frisbee on the lawns instead of engaging in political activism PERIOD His peers inaction made him angry at the time PERIOD It was years before I could even touch a frisbee he said PERIOD

Rachel Martin  who wrote her senior thesis about the strike also mentioned the organizers frustration about other students lack of participation PERIOD

The students who were arguing the loudest at the faculty meetings and at the campus meetings and at the calls to go on strike  they I believe honestly felt that they were going to do serious political work with the time that was offered by classes being suspended she said PERIOD But not everybody did that. for some however the strikes problems lay not with inaction but with ideology PERIOD An article from the Records daily newsletter on May  describes the reactions of black students many of whom lamented the wateringdown of the fight to end political oppression a movement that black activists had long been pushing PERIOD One black student denounced what he saw as the strikes performative nature saying that many of his peers were just playing revolutionary and showed no plans to sustain the movement in the long term PERIOD

Oncampus strike activities had mostly petered out by May  as the last students departed for the summer or pivoted their attention to their upcoming graduation PERIOD Pause for Peace which had failed to garner traction closed down PERIOD

Gradually people dispersed to do whatever they were going to be doing not all of which was antiwar or even political necessarily Lobe said PERIOD It just kind of faded into summer. on June  the College held its one hundred and eighty-first commencement PERIOD The Record reported An academic year that was far from traditional ended on a traditional note. the strike was not completely forgotten however as  seniors received provisional degrees which would be made official upon the completion of coursework by Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

At graduation I did not get a diploma said Katt who eventually received his degree after finishing his coursework PERIOD I got a folder with a little slip of paper Thats what I got at graduation PERIOD And I saved that piece of paper for a long time. a few weeks after the strike had died down an article in the alternative student newspaper The Williams Advocate ruminated on the possible effects of the strike on the College PERIOD

People say this strike will change Williams College the article read PERIOD People say Williams College will never be the same PERIOD But people  even the ones who think themselves so farsighted  rarely see beyond present actions things they can feel. in the fall classes resumed as scheduled despite a fleeting plea from students to suspend classes during the week before the  midterm election PERIOD

There is not a clear consensus on the strikes efficacy even among its organizers PERIOD I dont think it was successful Katt said citing the low levels of student participation on campus PERIOD

Rhoads argued that although the Nixon administrations eventual shift in military policy did not result from the strikes alone student activism was a piece of the pie. the strike also prompted a moment of reckoning for American students he said PERIOD

What the strike did was get us to think about what it was that needed to be done in America to change the course of history he said PERIOD It was like All these things are wrong  what are we going to do to fix it
