The English psychpop band Glass Animals has been making a splash in the pop music scene since the release of their debut LP Zaba in  PERIOD With hits such as Gooey and Pools the group headed by frontman Dave Bayley developed a name for themselves on their first record by creating strange jungleinspired dance music that kept fans coming back to that record for years PERIOD The bands second album How To Be A Human Being was released two years later in August  PERIOD The album took a notably different approach than Zaba abandoning its naturebased soundscape and replacing it with a more varied and somewhat industrial sound all the while maintaining the lively spirit of the band that fans fell in love with on the first record PERIOD

Prior to the groups third fulllength album Dreamland released this past Friday I wasnt sure what to expect PERIOD Ive been a massive fan of Glass Animals since early high school and Zaba is one of my favorite albums of all time PERIOD However it has been four years since the groups last release and it wasnt clear if Dreamland would continue the new sound introduced on How To Be A Human Being or if they would significantly change it up again as they had between Zaba and that second release PERIOD

Now that Dreamland is out and I have had the chance to listen to it nonstop all weekend I think I can confidently say I absolutely love this record PERIOD

Dreamland is the logical next development in the sound of Glass Animals PERIOD The music once again maintains the almost exotic atmosphere the band crafted so well on their previous two albums but theres also a lot of growth in the sound PERIOD The group wasnt afraid to branch out beyond the limits of its previous LPs PERIOD It explored new genres and ideas that didnt have a place in the bands previous works and the result is an incredibly fresh exciting and surprisingly personal album that is sure to garner new fans and revitalize the passion of existing ones PERIOD

The new album consists of  tracks four of which are brief interludes that utilize bits of audio from Bayleys childhood home videos making the total runtime right around  minutes PERIOD

On Instagram Bayley has been pushing the idea that the album is about growing up and when listening to the lyrics its easy to see why PERIOD This is farandaway the most personal record that Glass Animals has put out yet PERIOD Lyrically most of the tracks are based on Bayleys own childhood experiences from budding friendships to witnessing spousal abuse growing up in Texas before eventually moving to the U.K PERIOD at the age of  PERIOD The songs of Dreamland provide a look inside the experiences of Bayley both as a child and as an adult coming to terms with love pain confusion and a myriad of different emotions PERIOD

The first track Dreamland serves as a table of contents for the entire record PERIOD Many of the specific ideas and themes of the album are introduced in this song before being explored deeper later on PERIOD The hypnotic sound of the title track also serves to slowly immerse the listener in the soundscape the album is creating PERIOD The song isnt a bombastic or exciting opener like Life Itself and Flip on the previous two records but it does an excellent job preparing the audience for all of the excitement and introspection that comes throughout the rest of the tracklist PERIOD

The pace picks up quickly after the opening track as the album immediately moves into Tangerine one of the most colorful and grooving tracks Glass Animals has ever produced PERIOD The song creates a light and airy tone that lifts the listeners spirits before delving into an incredibly fun and frankly fabulous groove that makes it hard not to dance along PERIOD The song mixes elements introduced in both Zaba and How To Be A Human Being but it still manages to create its own experience showing that instead of relying on the sounds of previous LPs the band is growing and learning to apply ideas in fresh new ways PERIOD

This showcase of the bands willingness to explore new ideas is arguably the most present in the song Hot Sugar which follows Tangerine after a brief interlude PERIOD

Hot Sugar sees the band moving in a rhythm and bluesinspired direction which has been toyed with in the past PERIOD Bayleys softer high vocals mixed with the various harmonies and the slower more rhythmic beat the song develops make Hot Sugar one of the sexiest songs the band has ever released PERIOD The songs lyrics explore the idea of someone who thinks theyre falling in love but in reality is entranced by the allurement of their potential loves personality PERIOD This idea of confused love comes up multiple times throughout the record specifically in the tracks Melon and the Coconut and Waterfalls Coming Out Your Mouth and each time theres a new twist that resonates a little deeper with the listener PERIOD

Some of the edgier cuts from Dreamland include the tracks Space Ghost Coast to Coast and the first single released off of the record Tokyo Drifting. space Ghost Coast to Coast brings a darker more bassdriven sound to the album which matches the lyrics that speculate the motivations of an old friend of Bayleys attempt at a school shooting PERIOD Tokyo Drifting talks about diving facefirst into a lavish lifestyle of drugs and fashion PERIOD The song also features a verse delivered by rapper Denzel Curry which marks the first time the group has prominently featured another artist on one of their albums PERIOD This Denzel Curry feature on Tokyo Drifting is definitely a new and different vibe than what Glass Animals has done in the past but it fits in very well with the atmosphere Dreamland creates PERIOD

Glass Animals continues this streak of opting to change up and experiment with their style throughout the record with highlights being tracks such as Waterfalls Coming Out Your Mouth Its All So Incredibly Loud and Heat Waves. each song on Dreamland is a piece of a larger puzzle and there is some assembly required PERIOD The album is undoubtedly great for casual listening but its once the listener sits down and starts putting these pieces together that the quality of Dreamland really begins to shine through PERIOD The amount of care thought and work put into every track on this album is staggering PERIOD Each song gives the audience something new to reflect on PERIOD It introduces many different ideas and themes which will hopefully make Dreamland a record that only gets better with age PERIOD

Im not sure where the album stands among the three Glass Animals has now released but the fact that Im not already willing to rank it below any of the others  both of which I absolutely love  is encouraging PERIOD Dreamland provides some of the most refined and focused material the band has put out to date and it makes the fouryear wait more than worth it PERIOD Seeing the bands evolution from Zaba to Dreamland makes me believe that whatever the band decides to put out next will also be something new and different to look forward to PERIOD For now Im more than happy to keep Dreamland on an endless loop PERIOD
