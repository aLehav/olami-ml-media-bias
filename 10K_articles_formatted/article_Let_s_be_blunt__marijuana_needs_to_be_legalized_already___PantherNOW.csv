I am tired of hearing about another friend of mine getting arrested for a small bag of weed PERIOD Im even more exhausted to hear about the ridiculous sentences weed smokers get that sometimes surpass the jail time of convicted rapists and murders PERIOD

Its time to start talking about marijuana seriously and I am more than willing to start that conversation today PERIOD

Comedian and social critic Bill Hicks once asked Why is marijuana against the law It grows naturally upon our planet PERIOD Doesnt the idea of making nature against the law seem to you a bit  PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD unnatural PERIOD

This is the same question just about every other American citizen were asking themselves on Monday and for the past  years since the drug became popular in the 1970s PERIOD

Marijuana is a word that both strikes fear in the unenlightened and joy in those who have firsthand seen and felt the benefits of consuming this product of nature PERIOD

If you are still a part of the group that relies on traditional and close minded perspectives in order to prevent an existential crisis from happening I barely understand but we need to consider how the decriminalization of the plant can help those who need it for a change PERIOD

Tetrahydrocannabinol THC and Cannabidiol CBD are the two chemical components of the marijuana plant PERIOD The first produces the psychoactive tendencies the public is familiar with the second a catalyst for the biggest medical revolution weve seen in a long time PERIOD

There are going to be people who will deny medical benefits of marijuana but do so out of pure stubbornness because there have been countless occasions and studies that prove otherwise PERIOD According to a study published in Journal of the American Medical Association in January  marijuana does not impair lung function and can even increase lung capacity PERIOD

Robert J PERIOD DeLorenzo of Virginia Commonwealth University proved marijuana extracts can prevent seizures by binding to the brain cells responsible for controlling excitability and regulating relaxation in a  study PERIOD

Researchers at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco reported in  that cannabidiol stops cancer by turning off a gene called Id1 in order to prevent it from spreading to noncancerous cells PERIOD

Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon of recently wrote an open letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell saying the NFL should stop testing players for marijuana and that the league should start funding research into the plants ability to protect the brain since its healing properties can speed up recovery from concussions PERIOD

There have been other studies that support its usage to treat anxiety PTSD arthritis eating disorders glaucomathe list expands every year so why should we oppose this miraculous medical discovery

Underneath the Unites States Controlled Substances Act marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug along with LSD ecstasy meth and heroin PERIOD The Drug Enforcement Administration states on their official website that Schedule I drugs have no currently accepted medical use and can potentially result in severe psychological or physical dependence and abuse PERIOD

With  of the  states having passed bills or propositions that at least legalized medical marijuana we can see how inaccurate this definition is PERIOD

The scheduling also prevents further medical research from happening due to it being illegal on the federal level which has also infringed on the sovereignty of individual states PERIOD This is not only creating a rift between supportive medical practitioners and our government but also nullifies decisions made by citizens through fair electoral processes PERIOD

If saving lives and creating opportunities for people to surpass their health issues isnt enough of a reason for you to start supporting the legalization of marijuana then maybe money will PERIOD I will not pay you change your mind but you could potentially become the next multimillionaire because of this industry should you chose to become involved with it under legal circumstances of course PERIOD

Colorado became the first state to allow people to purchase and sell weed for recreational use and we are seeing the amazing results only one year after the change PERIOD Even though economists projected a higher amount the state has made  million in tax revenue and an additional  million through the medical sector PERIOD A good percentage of that was promised towards renovating and building public schools so this could also positively affect future generations PERIOD

If you are more concerned with how this country benefit from the industry right now the Marijuana Industry Group MIG estimates that  workers in the state are directly involved with cannabis with  to  of them joining the industry in the last five months PERIOD

There are real jobs that have been created in the past year that help families rise out from unemployment and put food on their table when they would be considered a criminal elsewhere PERIOD

Basically if you deny marijuana youre denying an individuals right to choose their medical treatment preventing growth in our job market and anchoring our country down to outdated and exaggerated stigmas PERIOD There is hope however and with proper education and activism there will be a day where I can tell you to roll up a joint take a hit and chill out man PERIOD

Until then enjoy your day and remember that there is now a Taco Bell on campus and that Breezeway Cafe bakes new cookies almost every hour PERIOD
