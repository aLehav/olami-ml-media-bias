5297,2015-03-09,"you really just have to sit back and admire the hole most Republicans have dug themselves into on climate change PERIOD The question isnt whether theyre right or wrong in denying that it exists  theyre wrong and  percent of climate scientists agree PERIOD The environment is being changed by human hands and as Fox News host Marc Morano recently said Youre entitled to your own opinion but you are not entitled to your own facts. of course he followed that up with its a concept not everyones comfortable with and dove into accusations of Googles new accuracybased ranking system somehow being fascist but the point stands PERIOD The sky is blue PERIOD The grass is green PERIOD Human action is changing the climate PERIOD Period PERIOD We shouldnt take those who deny the last claim any more seriously than we would take those who deny either of the first two PERIOD

The funny part as evidenced by the number of Republicans jumping on the Im not a scientist questiondodging bandwagon is that the GOPs leadership surely knows this PERIOD It just doesnt seem to think that cutting its losses and moving on is a good move PERIOD Republicans confession that they dont know what theyre talking about is clearly a step up from their previous tendency ofoutright climate denial but it underscores the fact that their party is simply in too deep to admit fault PERIOD The not a scientist movement and the attitudes that drive it thus leave us in a race to see which will cave first the Republican Party or the earth PERIOD But if 2013s government shutdown is any indication we shouldnt be so sure that sanity public opinionor the undeniably real effects of our environmental complacency will be enough to sway the right PERIOD

Still some continue to deny both climate change and humans causal role therein PERIOD There are those who argue for example that humanbased climate change is too difficult to predict or examine making assertions of its existence groundless PERIOD Indeed climate change is extremely hard to predict a fairly consistent rule in fact is that our models have tended to underestimate how bad climate change really is PERIOD But to argue that there is some missing link between extant changes to our planet and human causality as Senator James Inhofe has lamenting The arrogance of people to think that we human beings would be able to change what He God is doing in the climate. is again completely false PERIOD Science has firmly established that humans are not just witness to but are the direct cause of climate change PERIOD I challenge you reader to convince an Earth Systems major or a professor in the department that climate change is simply too hard to observe for our science to be accurate or that the work of these scientists is meaningfully negated by the fact that you dont like it PERIOD My email address is under this article PERIOD Message me if you succeed PERIOD

Then theres the assertion that our planet has been going through such cycles all its life and that this is simply some pubertylike awkward hiccup in the Earths life cycle PERIOD Of course there is little doubt that our planet has known tropical periods and ice ages PERIOD But at no period in its history has a quarter of atmospheric carbon an unbelievably powerful trapper of heat been manmade nor has an increase in the Earths temperature ever coincided with a decrease in solar activity PERIOD Our planets surface and lower atmosphere are warming while its outer atmosphere is cooling a process that is exactly what we would expect to see from humancaused climate change PERIOD Climate skeptics have no answer to the question of how greenhouse gasses wouldnt be affecting our planet if changes being seen now were due only to cycles PERIOD Perhaps these pollutants were buried in the sand alongside the GOPs heads PERIOD

Others go on to point out that other countries have done more environmental damage than the U.S. but aside from the extent to which that argument ignores the previous assertion that man hasnt altered the environment in the first place the point is a complete red herring PERIOD Its far too late to quibble about who did it worse the fact of the matter is that global warming is an absolutely alarmsoundingly urgent issue and that every single person in the world will be affected by it PERIOD Perhaps if Republicans jump ship now on climate denial they can save some amount of face surely they could maintain base support by framing the issue as a chance to push for a privatesector boom in green innovation PERIOD Is there truly no tax break that could turn this intoa conservative issue no biggovernmentbogeyman fearmongering that could make the battle against pollutants a battle for individual liberty Is it not one already Isnt it a shame that the survival of our race is coming down to such petty political calculations

Or perhaps global warming denial will simply be added to the Conservative Hall of Shame taking a spot alongside resistance to civil womens and gay rights PERIOD I hope the museum isnt close to sea level PERIOD Maybe theyll add a water slide PERIOD

Good morning Stanford Its another beautiful day out here on the west coast sun shining skies blue and balmy temperature in the 60s and well about perfect PERIOD Yes its certainly easy for us to forget the terrible winter storm pounding up and down their side of the country PERIOD Apparently its a real doozy this time striking as far south as Texas with subfreezing temperatures while winter storms Juno Remus and now Thor blast New York and New Jersey with ice and snow PERIOD Even the inner states Arkansas Georgia and the Carolinas arent immune this season PERIOD

And now the same thought just crossed all of your heads Surely it must be due to global warm climate change PERIOD

Yes the first labels somewhat fallen out of fashion by now PERIOD The most recent satellite data lists a lack of any sort of warming trend since  when the recurring El Nio weather pattern drove global temperatures up approximately . degrees above the previous average PERIOD In the past decade or so weve hovered around or slightly below this point even as worldwide carbon dioxide levels have continued to rise PERIOD Despite all the IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change computer models predicting a three to fourfold temperature increase over this same period the Earth has stayed a pretty even course barring the fluctuations typical of any large complex and still not fullyunderstood system PERIOD

So then climate change PERIOD A much broader more ambiguous label encompassing not only predicted temperature variations but also environmental anomalies that while no scientist or researcher ever thought might occur can nonetheless be sheltered under this umbrella term and pointed to proudly as another unfortunate result of carbon abuse PERIOD Ignoring that the U.S PERIOD has been fairly constant in greenhouse gas emissions since  and actually reached a peak in  pat yourselves on the back it seems there is no acceptable solution to some environmentalists other than to throw the full weight of public policy behind the ultimate goal of a zerocarbon footprint PERIOD Which then leads to capandtrade risky federal investments in green energy enterprisesand a general feeling of shame for anyone who dares drive unaccompanied to work PERIOD

I can understand the motivations behind these techniques if not their methods or goals PERIOD Ours is a beautiful country with resources meant neither for neglect nor exploitation but instead for management and cultivation PERIOD Its a balancing act as are many ideas within our system of government on the one hand are the treehuggers and green crusaders on the other hand are the clearcutters and stripminers and out of their bitter dislike comes that magic word we all champion sustainability PERIOD We harvest but we replant PERIOD We mine but we refill PERIOD We do things like attach scrubbers and baghouses to our coalfired plants the dirtiest means ofpower generation and go above and beyond the call of duty PERIOD

However the latest effort by the EPA seems a bit too much PERIOD In September  an addendum to the Clean Air Act was put forth that proposed newer more stringent carbon pollution standards for future power plants PERIOD With this the EPA essentially classified carbon dioxide  odorless flavorless nontoxic to humans and absolutely vital to the existence of all plant life on this Earth  as a pollutant PERIOD Last year more ambitious plans were announced to apply such regulation to existing power plants with an option to comply or shut down PERIOD Its directed mostly at the coalfired plants that provide  percent of the U.S.s electricity in particular in the Midwest region where this figure approaches a higher number PERIOD But coal is cheap and thus electricity from coal is cheapest of all sources notwithstanding natural gas PERIOD The result Skyrocketing energy prices and a huge blow to our economy PERIOD

Lets move to a bigger scale PERIOD Though climate change is championed as a global problem other superpowers seem to be doing very little at the moment to match our rather strenuous efforts PERIOD China in this respect immediately comes to mind though not with any idea of hope attached PERIOD In  they overshadowed the U.S PERIOD as the largest producer of carbon dioxide in the world and while our numbers have dipped since then theirs have only grown PERIOD This past year China pumped nine billion metric tons of carbon dioxideinto itsskies along with particulate matter soot and other toxic chemicals like mercury and sulfur dioxide that the U.S PERIOD has long since heavily regulated but that go unchecked across the Pacific PERIOD The air quality in larger Chinese cities is practically legendary once described by the U.S PERIOD Embassy as crazy bad and others cities like New Delhi are not too far behind them PERIOD Unfortunately the borders of a country dont matter much to smog and smoke PERIOD

It seems that once again were asking the wrong questions PERIOD Rather than How can we force ourselves to curb our already decreasing carbon dioxidelevels regardless of the economic impacts on a cheap energydependent country it should be In what ways can we adapt to a continuously changing environment No one doubts that the Earths temperature is in a state of oscillatory flux even without any kind of icecore data listing its repetitive cycles of heating and cooling the evidence of the most recent Little Ice Age demonstrates how such centurywide fluctuations are common to our planet PERIOD Some of them are more distressing than others causing mass freezes across farmland and locking down transportation PERIOD Others are gentler PERIOD Do we prepare for them or do we vainly try to stop them in their tracks

It is a great folly to assume mankind can control something as complex as weather and one only slightly less to presume we know everything there is to know about it PERIOD Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may influence the Earths meteorological systems but the evidence to such is inconclusive at best and downright manipulative at worst PERIOD A better understanding an unbiased understanding should always be pursued before major potentially damaging policies are enacted across our country which tries hard enough as it is PERIOD There is no religion here only science PERIOD Let us treat it as such PERIOD
