Weve seen Matthew McConaughey in many forms PERIOD Weve seen him as a stripper a treasure hunter and a seedy lawyer just to name a few PERIOD Last Fridays  casts McConaughey in a new light PERIOD

 centers on Ron Woodruff a Texan electrician living in the late 80s PERIOD Woodruffs favorite hobbies include drugs alcohol and sex PERIOD That all changes when hes diagnosed with AIDS and given only  days to live PERIOD From that moment on Woodruff has to struggle with everyone from pharmaceutical companies to the IRS PERIOD Along the way he must face the prejudice against AIDS victims that was all too present during the 80s PERIOD

In this film McConaughey is barely recognizable  he dropped a considerable amount of weight in preparation for the role PERIOD Besides that McConaughey steps perfectly into the character PERIOD Woodruff offers a complex role and McConaughey rises to the challenge PERIOD He plays the character believably and seems to become Ron Woodruff PERIOD Its a seamless emotional performance that has the ability to blow anyone away PERIOD

Credit should also be given to  Seconds to Mars frontman Jared Leto PERIOD Letos character Rayon is a drag queen also diagnosed with AIDS PERIOD He and Woodruff form an unlikely bond as they begin their crusade to supply safe drugs to others who are sick PERIOD Arguably his part is the films most heartbreaking story PERIOD Letos performance has an intensity about it that rivals McConaugheys PERIOD Leto grabs you by the cowboy boots and never lets go PERIOD

The film has an undeniable truth about it PERIOD It teaches us that there is a wrong and a right way to treat people PERIOD Through Rons interactions with Rayon and his coworkers we can see the clear mark between right and wrong PERIOD For those of us who werent around in the 80s it gives us an idea of the suffering that went on and all the horrible misconceptions surrounding the AIDS virus PERIOD

Dallas Buyers Club has everything it needs to take home an Oscar PERIOD It has heart soul and phenomenal performances PERIOD It tells a story not often told a story that needs to be heard PERIOD It drives in a point that everyone needs to hear in a way thats so gripping it needs to be seen to be believed PERIOD
