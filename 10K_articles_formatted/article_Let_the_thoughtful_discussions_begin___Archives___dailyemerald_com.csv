7666,1970-01-01,"most professional columnists are able to spout long and complicated rants while leaning hard to either the right or left side of the political spectrum preaching from the safety of an impressive office space located in the ivory tower of a respectable newsroom PERIOD These professionals are also able to use runon sentences at will PERIOD

I am not claiming to be one of those professionals PERIOD In contrast my preaching will be done from a small Macintosh in the armpit of the EMU PERIOD

Either by luck hoax or divine intervention I have become the new editorial editor for the Emerald an independent publication that has come under fire over the years for its annoyingly liberal undercurrents PERIOD

Personally I dont know how to label myself politically PERIOD I have only one political philosophy that has been strengthened time and again in my two years here at the University Practice what you preach PERIOD

I have found that most organized protests on campus are designed only to annoy people who are not in them PERIOD This epiphany was exemplified during the Workers Rights Consortium protest last year when angry students fought for the rights of poor sweatshop workers while murdering thousands of innocent blades of grass under their Nike shoes and Made in Korea tents PERIOD The horror

On the right hand I dont exactly have a framed picture of Ronald Reagan above my fireplace PERIOD And an eye for an eye will eventually leave the world blind unless you look the other way PERIOD

Luckily for Emerald readers this year we have assembled a roster of columnists who run the gamut of political and social labels for your ranting pleasure PERIOD Our purpose is not to alienate with holierthanthou rhetoric but to incite thoughtful discussion on issues pertinent to the University community PERIOD

I urge Emerald readers to continue to let us know how were doing and if you havent been incensed by our commentary contents at least once by the end of the year were not doing our jobs PERIOD

I look forward to the organized chaos PERIOD Sermon over PERIOD
