5454,2011-01-10,"last Friday the Daily reported that the board of trustees had approved a new gym to be built on west campus on the west end of Roble Field PERIOD My last column lamented some of our music facilities so I was interested in the fact that the administration after recently building Arrillaga gym decided to build another PERIOD We Stanfordians care about fitness and wellness but apparently we like to have our athletic facilities close by PERIOD It takes effort to go across campus to the gym Nonsense Well build another gym closer to you

Familiar names pop up in the funding of the project Arrillaga and Avery PERIOD Clearly we have some wealthy donors who care about sports PERIOD Luckily there are others who care about music and culture like the Bings who financed a concert hall and the overseas programs PERIOD

So is it just an example of donor preferences I think the administration could probably make more of an effort to fundraise for the arts departments PERIOD Several conversations Ive had in the music department include a teacher lamenting the fact that they cant get the funding to teach another class PERIOD And the only new music facility thats popped up around campus was the Band Shak for the LSJUMB who exists under the auspices of the athletic department PERIOD

Though part of the reason they built a new gym was that much of Roble Gym was converted to dance and performance space PERIOD So as I said in the column as well the situation for the arts isnt dire people are paying some attention PERIOD

But when the main reason cited for a new sports facility is proximity it shows a bias towards athletics PERIOD Oh if that could be the reason to build more practice rooms Musicians in Mirrielees have to go all the way to the music building to play. somehow I dont think that argument would persuade the board of trustees PERIOD
