The Dragon Prince is a new animated show on Netflix taking place in a fantasy world where elves and humans who once lived in harmony are locked in a seemingly endless struggle PERIOD Elven hatred for humans is at an alltime high after a group of human soldiers killed the king dragonprotector of the elven border and destroyed his only egg PERIOD The show primarily follows a young prince named Ezren and his halfbrother Callum who discover that the dragon egg was merely hidden and seek to return it to the elves bringing peace to the land PERIOD

Before I go into deepdive mode Ill say that I very much enjoyed what this show has to offer and am crossing my fingers for more seasons PERIOD It is geared toward a younger audience but I believe it has appeal beyond that and I highly recommend this to anyone interested in lighthearted fantasy tales PERIOD

Ill also mention that the animation is  strange PERIOD Im not going to try to interpret how it works but it seems like some frames have been cut out and as a result some characters feel like theyre floating PERIOD As a result the animation feels choppy PERIOD For some this will be a dealbreaker PERIOD I urge you to stick with it for at least three episodes as I found it didnt bother me as much as I thought it might PERIOD Still I would hope in future seasons the stutter could be altered a bit PERIOD

Okay deepdive mode  engaged PERIOD I was interested in The Dragon Prince because it is cocreated and co written by the head writer of Avatar The Last Airbender Aaron Ehasz the other creatorwriter of The Dragon Prince is Justin Richmond director of Uncharted  PERIOD

As amazing as the world and story of Avatar is the incredible characters are perhaps my favorite part feeling fleshed out and real PERIOD Ehasz was a big part in that PERIOD To expect that level of mastery again is unfair PERIOD Perhaps its because I watched Avatar twice this summer but I couldnt help but continually compare the two shows PERIOD

I see Avatar in the world Dragon Prince is trying to build PERIOD The Asian inspired world of Avatar is now a more familiar fantasy setting featuring dragons elves humans and more PERIOD While certainly not quite as intriguing as discovering bending or uncovering how each elemental culture lived in Avatar this world clearly has interesting stories as well PERIOD Every elf and animal in the world is connected by a uniting magic energy PERIOD That comes in six different elemental forms sun moon stars sky ocean and earth PERIOD Sound familiar We get glimpses of several of the elven groups one for each source yet only explore the Moonshadow elves PERIOD What are the other groups like What do the magical elven realms look like in general

I see similarities in the story each tells PERIOD In Dragon Prince we have a once peaceful land that is now divided by war PERIOD The formerly united continent has been split into two realms Xadia home to the elves and the Human Kingdoms PERIOD Years pass and two princes Callum and Ezren find the egg located in the basement of their castle PERIOD Now they are searching for a way to bring peace back to the world PERIOD

The set up is eerily familiar PERIOD But in a way thats a good thing PERIOD The stakes are high and the story has many places it can go before the end is reached PERIOD Who knows what will happen and what strange characters may be met to shape their journey PERIOD

The characters are not quite as memorable as Avatars but that is to be expected PERIOD Prince Zuko was a pretty twodimensional villain for the first  episodes PERIOD In Dragon Prince we get a welldeveloped villain who already has an established relationship with the heroes PERIOD The protagonists are faced with many difficult choices with some bringing out dark results PERIOD We get some quirky side characters with loads of diversity as well the creators have stressed this as a point of emphasis PERIOD

It all moved a little too quickly for me the plot pushed forward at a breakneck pace PERIOD The emotional moments passed a bit too quickly and not as much time was spent learning about the characters as I would have liked PERIOD Not as much time exploring the world either PERIOD This is all completely understandable considering they were given only nine episodes to tell their story PERIOD

If you watch Avatar again youd find that the second and third seasons were more enjoyable than the first and it isnt until we really know the world and the characters that things get going PERIOD With what I have seen The Dragon Prince team can provide similar improvement with a few more seasons PERIOD Given time I believe we will discover an amazing world PERIOD

Given time I believe the story has the potential to go incredible places PERIOD And given time the already intriguing characters can become as memorable as those in Avatar. i believe The Dragon Prince will be great but it has a ways to go before it gets there PERIOD But I believe however that Callum and Ezran can save the world PERIOD
