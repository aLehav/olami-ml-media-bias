Guillermo del Toros Pacific Rim satisfies our inner 12yearold boy with visually stunning monster vs PERIOD mecha battles yet the liveaction scenes of the humans who control the robots leave audiences wanting more PERIOD

The films prologue reasonably explains the need for giant monster and robot fights After the Earth was invaded by dimensioncrossing sea monsters called the Kaiju Japanese for strange beast human nations united to build giant robots called the Jaegers German for hunter to defend the worlds cities PERIOD These 26story robots are too mentally demanding for one pilot to control with his or her mind requiring two pilots telepathically linked PERIOD

Though initially successful the Jaeger program is defunded by the United Nations after subsequent Kaiju become stronger and more adapted to the Jaegers PERIOD With the discovery that the Kaiju are about to launch a fullscale assault that will wipe out humanity Stacker Pentecost Idris Elba known for The Wire and Thor gathers all the Jaegers he can  a mere four  and former Jaeger pilots to make one last attempt to destroy the portal to the Kaiju world PERIOD

One such recruit is Raleigh Becket Charlie Hunnam who retired distraught after losing his copilot brother with only halfhearted interest in saving the world PERIOD As the main character and prologue narrator one would expect Becket to have the most developed character arc yet he barely has any personality or development beyond your standard action hero PERIOD He stands up for himself and disobeys orders to save lives but thats all there is to say about him PERIOD

Once he gets over his trepidations of returning to Jaeger piloting remarkably quickly he never has any sort of selfquestioning PERIOD Instead he questions his commander Pentecost a lot mostly about why he wont let his hot Japanese love interest Mako Mori Rinko Kikuchi Academy Award nominee for Babel be his new copilot PERIOD

Mori is a slightly more interesting character though with a cliche tragic past and tough personality she still has more passion than Becket a trait that comes into conflict with her cultural urges toward respect PERIOD Her mysterious relationship with her father figure Pentecost is the most poignant and realistic of the film PERIOD The same cannot be said for her romance with Becket a love story mostly of uninspired dialogue helped along by a neural bridge PERIOD

The remaining characters including Robert Kazinsky as the overlymasculine Jaeger pilot Chuck Hansen Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as goofy scientists Dr PERIOD Newton Geizler and Dr PERIOD Hermann Gottlieb respectively who study the Kaiju and del Toro regular Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau a black market dealer of Kaiju organs are developed quickly but are still entertaining caricatures PERIOD

Even Ellen McLain voicing the computer  as she does in the Portal video games  is funny on a few occasions PERIOD It is only when del Toro approaches the more complex primary characters that he encounters difficulties PERIOD

Del Toro was much more at home crafting a visual masterpiece in the Jaeger vs PERIOD Kaiju fights PERIOD Unlike many dark sterile summer movies Pacific Rim is saturated with color and artistry as del Toro based the visuals of ocean battles on classic Japanese art PERIOD The oneonone physical fights are also a nice relief from films with massive armies on both sides PERIOD

Yet no matter how stunning the cinematography the battles cannot stand on their own  they like all action movies require an emotional backdrop PERIOD

While the human scenes work well enough to keep the action sequences exciting emotionally they are not stirring enough to demand significant emotional attachment PERIOD I found myself not really caring if Becket or anyone else lived or died PERIOD

And a piece of advice While the 3D effects may be cool for the battle scenes the extracost may not be worth paying as almost half the film would just be 3D talking scenes PERIOD

Pacific Rim may be a worthy addition to the Japanese monster genre with its  special effects yet the lack of a strong human element keeps the film from becoming anything more than a popcorncrunching Bmovie of the twenty-first century PERIOD
