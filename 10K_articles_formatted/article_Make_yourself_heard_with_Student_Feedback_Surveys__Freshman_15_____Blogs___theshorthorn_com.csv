If last semesters trends and statistics hold you probably havent filled out the student feedback surveys for all the classes you took this semester PERIOD As The Shorthorn reported earlier this month only  of students enrolled in either on campus or online classes completed the assessments of their professors and coursework during the fall semester PERIOD Those numbers fell considerably from previous semesters where participation rates ranged from the high  percent range into the 70s PERIOD

The collapse traces its origin to the switch from paper surveys to online questionnaires according to the story PERIOD But we should reverse that trend this semester PERIOD Professors and administrators need our feedback and what reason do we have not to provide it

I admit that last semester I did not provide my evaluations PERIOD But I did this goaround and it took me just ten to fifteen minutes for the five classes I enrolled in this semester PERIOD Each survey asks the same standard straightforward questions inquiring for example if you would recommend your professor to another student and what you would tell the professor to do differently or to keep doing next semester PERIOD

My Critical Thinking instructor Harry Reeder emphasized in class how uniquely important he finds student feedback PERIOD As someone who serves on committees that hand out teaching awards he described how difficult the decision process could turn out when professors with broadly similar accomplishments and success come up for consideration PERIOD Reviews could make a difference but often they find little or none filed away which makes it difficult or impossible to determine what their respective students thought of them PERIOD

Without feedback how can professors improve aspects of the course that students didnt find effective After all they cant read minds PERIOD If you didnt like something about the way the professor structured the class you ought to say that in hopes he or she will change it to benefit students next semester PERIOD

The information you give in your answers should also be specific and actionable PERIOD Saying this class was dumb wont help anybody change anything PERIOD However remarking that lectures were not well organized or you speak too quietly for people in the back to hear can help a professor rearrange how they do things for a positive effect PERIOD

Similarly if your goal is to give praise a response like you are a good teacher or this class was interesting doesnt do much either PERIOD Saying something like I enjoyed how you explained topic X lets them know exactly what theyre doing right and to keep it up PERIOD

Also you have no need to worry about professor reprisals PERIOD Instructors receive their feedback surveys with no names attached and only after the university certifies final grades PERIOD

Im not naive enough to think that every professor will take every suggestion to heart PERIOD But you never what a difference your comment might make PERIOD An instructor who genuinely wants to help his students and serve as the best teacher he or she can will try to improve based upon feedback PERIOD You should give them the chance to do so PERIOD
