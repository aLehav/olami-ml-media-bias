2765,2010-01-28,"as someone who has had a long undergraduate and graduate career at the University of Wisconsin Ive literally seen it all with ASM PERIOD Conservative takeovers liberal takeovers whatever the hell besides absurd the Ten Fat Tigers were election debacles scandals full scale replacement or abolition attempts and yes the occasional success PERIOD Each year tends to have a unique pithy summary beyond it sucks.The narrative of ASM this year follows how the far left tried to take it over failed and now is bogged down with infighting and incapable of anything PERIOD To a small degree this is true PERIOD

To understand whats really going on in ASM though you need to understand the underlying philosophical mismatch of the organization PERIOD ASM is the unhappy marriage of two functions PERIOD The first is to serve as the group that students use to fulfill their obligations and responsibilities to the entire studentbody faculty administration and State in the governance of parts of the University  the boring paper pushing role PERIOD The second is as an organization used to identify issues beyond the narrow scope of immediate campus governance and to take action when things need to be done  the organizing protests role PERIOD

To solidify this consider an example from this year ASM is overwhelmingly in favor of LGBT equality PERIOD Given that ASM cannot legislatively decree that equality what if anything should it do There is a range of answers depending on which of the two functions of ASM you believe is more important PERIOD

Alex Gallagher wrote about this arrangement extensively two years ago in a piece called Dont Kill ASM Just Cut It In Two and a followup blog post PERIOD His thesis was that each role would try to pull ASM in a direction that would harm the other and that it would be best to split ASM in half PERIOD

Gallagher was a bit too fatalistic as you can have both functions in the same organization PERIOD What ASM cant have is long nights debating what the right balance of activism should be on every single agenda item PERIOD Thats what makes meetings intolerable and unproductive PERIOD Well that and ASM members never reading meeting material making long speeches instead of just rubberstamping that which should be rubberstamped wasting time trying to debate the use of leading questions during question and answer time and an inability to use Roberts Rules without shooting themselves in the foot. most ASM council members want nothing more than to just get the hell out of the room PERIOD I have wasted more of my life arguing with ideologues on both sides of the activist ASM worldview trying to pass completely innocuous items than should ever be necessary PERIOD

Gallagher got the core issue right most of what ASM wants to accomplish and is charged with doing requires administration cooperation and trust PERIOD That trust cant be maintained if ASM is ready to pounce on the administration straight away and when broken takes years to rebuild PERIOD Even today years after the last student occupation the Chancellors office is still permanently locked. at the same time a participatory government that engages and relies on the talent of its citizens is compatible with a representative government be it Congress or ASM PERIOD That participation beyond just voting is vital to ensuring a healthy civic debate and not demagoguery PERIOD ASM needs both roles and needs them to be balanced PERIOD The ASM leadership has done a good job of striking that balance but not all members have matched it PERIOD

The narrowfocus side can be brought even if begrudgingly toward more action PERIOD The activist left however is unlikely to ever be happy in a balanced marriage PERIOD The truth is that they tried to take over the wrong organization PERIOD Their target should have been the United Council UC and there should be a grand bargain in ASM to ensure such a take over PERIOD

UCs prime focus is advocacy mobilization and campaigns  all things the left is good at and none of the procedural crap the activist left hates and arent very good at anyway PERIOD UC has a budget staff and philosophically aligns with the activist worldview but lately the activist strength has atrophied PERIOD UC desperately needs reinvigoration and because its headquartered in Madison strong UWMadison leadership is ideal PERIOD UC has seen its membership gutted in the fouryear universities and really needs committed groups to network its way back to many UW schools PERIOD In short UC would love the renewed attention PERIOD

Both sides would see this as a sort of Faustian bargain but there are some confidence building steps that all of ASM could get behind to help it along PERIOD First there is an opening on the UC board that Madison is responsible for filling PERIOD That should be immediately filled with someone from the far left PERIOD The activist left is convinced funding for their groups is always precarious even in a viewpoint neutral system PERIOD Ive made some proposals in the past that would do more to ensure fairness and those could be fasttracked to reduce worries PERIOD In the spring there wouldnt be a competing slate of candidates but instead one that had the endorsement of all sides and most importantly promised to support a Vote Yes campaign for UC when its next due in  PERIOD That support is crucial  UC nearly lost in  with no organized opposition PERIOD The slate would also promise to send enough attendees to UC General Assemblies to ensure the Madison delegation had enough support to accomplish its goals PERIOD

The far left would be much happier free in UC than trapped in the confines of ASM and frankly theres no one better on campus or in the state to turn UC around PERIOD The new arrangement would reduce tensions in ASM and both organizations functioning better will result in more progress for students PERIOD
