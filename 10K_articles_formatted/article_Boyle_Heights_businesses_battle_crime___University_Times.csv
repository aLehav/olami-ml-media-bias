Mora shared some major challenges and possible solutions in a recent interview with UT Community News PERIOD

When did your business begin and what kind of products or services does your business provide

My parents actually started the business about  years ago PERIOD It is a family business so right now its just me and my parents PERIOD We pretty much offer everything for the home in terms of modern vintage and antiques and we also offer repairing services for their appliances like refrigerators and other home electronics PERIOD We have a very good clientele which is mostly movie companies and TVfilms who would come in and buy like  things for their sets. where do you get your stuff Do people bring them in or do you get them somewhere in particular

We get stuff from different places PERIOD We have vendors when it comes to appliances we also have people come in and we take donations so a little bit from everywhere PERIOD Most of the stuff is going to be secondhand at least  of it is PERIOD The way we set prices on items is by checking them online and we actually place it at a fourth of what it actually costs online. how long have you been in this particular location and what are some few challenges that you as a business owner in this neighborhood face

My parents have been in this location for about  years PERIOD The biggest issue in this neighborhood is homelessness PERIOD Im sure you have seen some outside in the streets and because of that I dont know if its because people are not making enough money in the area and become homeless but that also causes robberies in most of the businesses around. has that issue ever affected your business in particular

It has not affected us personally because our store is pretty much locked up when it comes to security but the restaurant next door has suffered robbery and also the market next to us. have you ever tried to present the issue to your local government or city council

Yes I actually contacted the city online and pretty much let them know that that has been an issue that homelessnessThey mentioned that they were going to try and solve the issue by helping them so that they can move from the area and actually put them in like a housing facility but it hasnt happened yet PERIOD They are still there and it has been months. what methods do you use to promote your business

As far as the business goes weve actually included within the last two years selling online we have done Facebook Marketplace we have utilized basically other platforms like InstagramThat has actually helped us a lot. business
