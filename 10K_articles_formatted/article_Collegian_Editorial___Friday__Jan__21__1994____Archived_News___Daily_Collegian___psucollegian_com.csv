A little kindness from the fans might just cure sports madness

The graceful glide on the ice was shattered last week when an attacker struck figure skater Nancy Kerrigan in the leg PERIOD The assault is one more example that the world of sports is not isolated from the pain of an increasingly violent society PERIOD

Several events illustrate athletes arent any safer than the rest of us  take the stabbing of tennis player Monica Seles during a match last April and the  terrorist invasion of the Olympic Village in Munich where  Israeli athletes were taken hostage and killed PERIOD

Recently we have heard several declarations against violence PERIOD Politicians have been spouting the need for less guns on the street and for educating youth to solve problems in diplomatic  rather than violent ways PERIOD

Obviously the problem goes beyond the streets PERIOD The sports environment is not immune to societys ills meaning if we want to continue to have our sporting events and entertainment in safe arenas we the fans must tackle the root of the problem PERIOD After all how many times have you wished injury on the opposing quarterback

Athletic officials must step up the security at events so that a crazed fan cannot run onto a field and try to tackle the football players or a random knife from the stadium bleachers doesnt puncture a baseball player PERIOD

But security is not enough PERIOD

Its sad that fans feel obliged to hurt athletes who have devoted their lives to hone their skills PERIOD And its sorry that athletes and fans cannot rely on their own abilities to win but resort to offthefield attempts at cutting down competitors see Texas cheerleading mom and friends of Tonya Harding PERIOD

A lot is at stake when it comes to money and reputation PERIOD But that is no excuse for the existence of violence in the world of sports PERIOD And when it comes down to it a game is just a game PERIOD
