It was a wellrounded effort that fueled No PERIOD  Oklahoma to a  upset of No PERIOD  Texas Sunday in Norman PERIOD

 OU coach Sherri Coale said PERIOD

While the Sooners didnt shoot the ball particularly well Sunday they knocked down . percent of their free throws to Texas  percent PERIOD

The Longhorns came into the game averaging . points per game on . percent shooting PERIOD However the Sooners held them to just . percent in each half PERIOD

Credit to Oklahoma I thought their defense was tremendous Texas coach Karen Aston said PERIOD They were in the gaps they did their work early and they had a sense of urgency that was necessary in a game like this. oklahoma outrebounded Texas  to  as well PERIOD Junior Maddie Manning led the Sooners in rebounds with eight PERIOD

The Sooners defense was especially dominant in the fourth quarter as Texas scored just seven points PERIOD

They flipped that switch for themselves and then went on a  run in the fourth quarter and thats probably as sound as Ive see us play defensively against five great scorers  Coale said PERIOD I mean the Longhorns dont put anyone on the floor who cant score PERIOD So its not like we could cheat anywhere we just had to do it fundamentally together and I thought the fourth quarter defense was fantastic. while this win is the biggest of the Sooners season guard Peyton Little said there is still work to be done PERIOD
