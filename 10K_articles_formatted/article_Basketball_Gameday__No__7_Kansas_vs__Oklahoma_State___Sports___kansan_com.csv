Junior guard Devonte Graham hits a three in the second half against Oklahoma State on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD Graham had  points in Kansas  victory PERIOD

Kansas enters Saturdays game against Oklahoma State following a terrific road win in the Sunflower Showdown PERIOD Oklahoma State on the other hand enters the game off the back of a tough home defeat to TCU PERIOD The Jayhawks are  alltime against the Cowboys PERIOD

The game will take place in Allen Fieldhouse on Saturday at  a.m PERIOD

It will also be broadcasted on CBS and the Jayhawk Radio Network PERIOD

The Cowboys are currently the worst team in the Big  but redshirt senior guard Jeffrey Carroll is their best player PERIOD Averaging  points per game he is Oklahoma States most consistent scoring threat but will struggle against Kansas guards PERIOD What Carroll has going for him the most is his height PERIOD At 6foot6 he could pose a tough matchup PERIOD



With his  pounds it can be assumed senior forward Solomon Mitchell will be guarding Kansas sophomore forward Udoka Azubuike PERIOD Azubuike will have the advantage in this match up which is why its important to look at PERIOD The Jayhawks outrebounded the Wildcats and will have another chance to do so against the Cowboys PERIOD

Tavarius Shine a redshirt junior is the Cowboys second leading scorer at just over  points a game PERIOD The Cowboys dont score the ball well and the Jayhawks have a knack for lighting up the score board in a hurry PERIOD Shine will likely guard Malik Newman or Svi Mykhailiuk both of which have played their best as of late PERIOD

Next Up The Cowboys head to Lawrence Saturday morning to take on No PERIOD 7KUHoops.LetsWorkpic.twitter.comwamDN2rPC0

Senior guard Devonte Graham has been struggling as of late offensively PERIOD Despite his threepoint numbers staying relatively on par Graham has lost all sense of touch around the rim PERIOD Graham is 1for11 in the past two games shooting inside the arc PERIOD Graham will need to find his touch again for Kansas to continue to lead the Big  PERIOD

Junior guard Lagerald Vick just cant break out of his current slump PERIOD Vick has scored just  points over the past three games PERIOD His performances have improved over the past two games but Vick is still far from where he was just before Christmas PERIOD

Redshirt sophomore guard Malik Newman has been on a tear as of late PERIOD Newman has scored  points in the past two games a huge improvement from his early season struggles PERIOD Newman is a viable second ball handler and allows Graham to take possessions off throughout the game PERIOD
