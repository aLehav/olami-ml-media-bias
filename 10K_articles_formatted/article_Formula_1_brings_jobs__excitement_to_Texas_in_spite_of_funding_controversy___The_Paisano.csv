On Nov PERIOD  Austin TX saw its first F1 United States Grand Prix racing event at the newly opened Circuit of the Americas track PERIOD Formula  racing otherwise known as F1 is a familiar sport in many regions of Europe but has been relatively unknown to the U.S PERIOD since  the last time an F1 event was held on U.S PERIOD soil PERIOD

The inaugural event named Austin Fan Fest was held from Nov PERIOD  in downtown Austin and included acts from Aerosmith Cheap Trick Flo Rida Cobra Starship and international singer Juanes PERIOD The festival turned downtown Austin into a hotspot with its music venues F1 car simulator stations and parties along with other interactive activities PERIOD The event was expected to host not only Austin natives but also visitors from around the world PERIOD

The track is located  miles southeast of downtown Austin and runs for . miles with an elevation of  feet making it accessible to  spectators PERIOD

Circuit of the Americas is much more than a track PERIOD The multipurpose facility is expected to host educational and medical programs as well as a driving academy PERIOD As stated on its website the facility will feature a  square foot medical center that will provide paramedic and EMS services and opportunities for students to receive medical training PERIOD A  square foot conference media center is another feature of the circuit PERIOD

The project went into development in May  and construction began in December  PERIOD The facility encountered many roadblocks along the way as there were rumors that production had stopped in November  when contract disagreements took place PERIOD With Red McCombs and Bobby Epstein on board as the founding partners the production of the facility took off and now it humbly rests in the town of Elroy which is a few miles away from Austin PERIOD

Lately the biggest controversy surrounding the Circuit of the Americas is whether the Texas Comptroller Susan Combs had the right to greenlight its production without the publics approval PERIOD According to the Texas Tribune it is illegal to approve an article without proper consideration by all parties PERIOD

According to the Texas Tribute Combs agreed to pay back a sum of  million within the next  years PERIOD Now the city of Austin must make arrangements to pay back its first installment of  million from the Major Events Trust Fund in the form of a tax subsidy PERIOD The percentage of sales tax revenue that was accumulated from tourism will influence the payment amount PERIOD

Opponents of the tax subsidy payment include those who are affiliated with the Tea Party PERIOD They argue that the attraction is a threat to other programs that are facing the possibility of being cut and suffer from insufficient funding PERIOD Supporters of the Circuit of the Americas contend that the facility will increase tourism and boost the economy PERIOD

Media and Community Relations Manager Ali Putnam said that the facility has created over  fulltime jobs in Austin as well as an additional  jobs for seasonal and event specific employees PERIOD In total Circuit of the Americas is expected to create more than  jobs said Putnam PERIOD
