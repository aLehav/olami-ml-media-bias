We feel that these are women who have made mistakes Sitko said PERIOD But they are women and children whose chances for improved lives and for normalcy have much to do with the maintenance of their bonds with each other during this difficult time. karen Hutt a pastor acting as liaison to Companions Journeying Together told the students at the meeting that sensitivity to the mothers prolonged separation is important to consider when interacting with the children PERIOD

This is the optimistic population said Hutt referring to the SSA students positive attitudes PERIOD Hutt said she hopes the optimism would spread to the children in the program PERIOD

I believe that our prison system is punitive and not rehabilitative Sitko said PERIOD She acknowledged that some SSA student groups are active but called for more partnerships with community organizations like Companions Journeying Together PERIOD

One hundred women from the Dwight Womens Correctional Facility of Illinois will participate in the Family Stories project PERIOD To encourage continued correspondence for everyone involved in the program the children will receive envelopes and stationery to write back to the SSA students as well as their mothers in prison PERIOD After writing to SSA students about the books they have read the children will receive certificates and small gifts as rewards for their achievements PERIOD

Hutt explained that the addition of a stamped and addressed letter to the mother might make a difference in promoting contact between the children and their mothers PERIOD She reflected on a case in which one mother received the first communication from her child in two years a connection Hutt said was made possible through this kind of program PERIOD
