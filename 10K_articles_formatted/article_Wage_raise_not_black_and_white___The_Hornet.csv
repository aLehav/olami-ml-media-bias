Gov PERIOD Jerry Brown signed bill AB  into law in September increasing the minimum wage to  by July  and  by January  PERIOD This will give California workers the highest minimum wage levels in the nation well above the federal minimum wage of . per hour PERIOD

President Barack Obama also proposed to increase the federal minimum wage to . in February PERIOD However the proposed wage increase has been stalled by Republicans in Congress who have filibustered PERIOD At the moment Democrats do not have enough votes to push the bill through PERIOD

The effects of this increase are still somewhat unclear whether it will help families living below the poverty line or end up hurting businesses PERIOD Republicans say that employers will have to cut jobs in order to keep up with the cost increases therefore further contributing to the states high unemployment rate PERIOD Democrats on the other hand say that the wage increase will help millions of lowwage workers in a state with the highest cost of living PERIOD

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the federal minimum wage increase could possibly eliminate over  jobs for lowwage workers by mid  but also lift about  families above the poverty threshold out of the  million who are currently living below the poverty line PERIOD

According to USA Today close to twothirds of minimum wage workers are employed in the food preparation or food service industry and about half are under the age of  PERIOD

Individual cities across the country often raise their minimum wage in order to keep up with the high cost of living such as San Francisco as well as suburbs of Seattle and Washington D.C PERIOD

In Seattle Mayor Ed Murray is attempting to push through an executive order to raise the citys minumum wage to  per hour PERIOD The increase would be phased in over seven years PERIOD

Jenelle Ulibarri nursing major thought that increasing the minimum wage is a good idea PERIOD

The cost of living around here is so expensive PERIOD Lowincome workers with families could really use the help and many students also provide for their families working for just minimum wage Ulibarri said PERIOD Even students without a family of their own probably wouldnt mind the raise. andrea OLoughlin childdevelopment major was somewhat unsure about the issue PERIOD

It does seem like a good thing because living in Southern California is so expensive but how long will it take before inflation makes everything else expensive in response OLoughlin said PERIOD I guess individual businesses and employers will just have to respond to it as they see fit PERIOD But if you look at San Francisco their minimum wage is already really high and here in Orange County we think its great but just look at the outrageous cost of living in a place like that. francis Mummery chair of the economics department and economics professor is opposed to increasing the minimum wage based on its many negative consequences PERIOD He said that the small economic recovery we are seeing now is not a good time to increase the cost of labor to employers PERIOD

Mummery pointed out that college students will be among the first to go if jobs are cut due to the wage increase PERIOD

If an employer is going to have to pay employees more the employer is going to want to get the most skilled and experienced workers possible Mummery said PERIOD Unfortunately this means that many younger workers are either not hired or those that are employed lose their jobs. it is unfortunate that the minimum wage has so many negative consequences Mummery added PERIOD It does benefit some workers but only those that manage to keep or get the reduced number of jobs available PERIOD It also sounds good for a politician to indicate he or she cares about people PERIOD You will never hear a politician say Im going to raise the minimum wage and force some of you to become unemployed. which is sad but true. your donation will support the student journalists of Fullerton College PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
