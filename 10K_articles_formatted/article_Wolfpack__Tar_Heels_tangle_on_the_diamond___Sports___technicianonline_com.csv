Sophomore pitcher Carlos Rodon pitches against Appalachian State University Friday February   PERIOD Rodon suffered his first loss of his collegiate career falling to the Mountaineers  at Doak Field at Dail Park PERIOD Photo by Ryan Parry PERIOD

The No PERIOD  N.C PERIOD State Wolfpack   ACC which led the ACC Atlantic Division at  straight wins the nations longest winning streak will put that streak on the line this weekend when No PERIOD  UNCChapel Hill visits Raleigh for a threegame series PERIOD The series begins Friday at  p.m PERIOD at Doak Field at Dail Park PERIOD

Since dropping the middle game of a series against Maryland on March  the Wolfpack has not lost a game PERIOD State is coming off of a walkoff  win over Davidson on Tuesday PERIOD In its last ACC series the Pack swept the then No PERIOD  Georgia Tech on the road in Atlanta PERIOD

The Tar Heels   ACC were riding a similarly impressive win streak until Tuesday PERIOD Carolina had racked up  straight victories until they were upset  by UNCWilmington PERIOD Despite that result UNC still holds the top ranking in college baseball as well as the lead in the ACCs Coastal Division PERIOD

Head coach Elliott Avent will use the same rotation that earned him the sweep of Georgia Tech PERIOD Senior righthander Ryan Wilkins will start on the mound for the Wolfpack on Friday with sophomore lefty Carlos Rodon who pitched a complete game last Saturday getting the start in game two PERIOD Freshman lefthander Brad Stone gets the call for Sunday PERIOD

Rodons  strikeouts lead the ACC among pitchers PERIOD

UNC probably has one of the best if not the best lineups in college baseball Wilkins said PERIOD You just go out there and make good pitches and thats all you can do. the significance of the series is not lost on the Wolfpack faithful PERIOD On Monday it was announced that all three games had sold out PERIOD

From a Tar Heels perspective the last series in Raleigh was not a pleasant one PERIOD Unranked N.C PERIOD State with a record barely over . at the time swept a threegame series with UNC including a  demolition in the series finale in  PERIOD Last season in Chapel Hill the Heels took two out of three tightly contested games and also beat the Pack in extra innings in the ACC Tournament in Greensboro PERIOD

States recent success has coincided with the return of sophomore shortstop Trea Turner from an ankle injury PERIOD Turner who set the N.C PERIOD State career stolen base record during the Georgia Tech series is batting . this season which leads the team as well as the ACC PERIOD He also leads the team in home runs with six despite having missed  games due to his injury PERIOD

You go through some things with injuries Avent said PERIOD Then you find a way to win some games PERIOD Through winning your team gets a little toughness PERIOD From toughness you get confidence and you find different ways to win. another State player to watch this weekend is senior first baseman Tarran Senay who will get his last crack at the Heels PERIOD Senay leads the team in RBIs with  and drove in nine of those in the series at Georgia Tech on his way to being named ACC Player of the Week PERIOD Senay is also third on the team in fielding percentage at . behind sophomore catcher Brett Austin and senior outfielder Bryan Adametz PERIOD

Its gonna be a ride Senay said of his last UNC series PERIOD It was fun and hopefully this weekend will be enjoyable just like the last three weekends and the past four years. the Tar Heels are led offensively by third baseman Colin Moran whose  home runs are good for second most in the ACC PERIOD Moran leads the conference in RBIs at  as well as in total hits with  PERIOD Starting pitcher Benton Moss is third in the conference with  strikeouts PERIOD

Its going to be a fun weekend. avent said PERIOD
