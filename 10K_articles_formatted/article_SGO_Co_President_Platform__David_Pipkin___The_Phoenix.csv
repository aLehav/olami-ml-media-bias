Friends

My name is David Pipkin and I am running for SGO CoPresident PERIOD Leadership in any form is never something to be taken lightly PERIOD It should not be chased out of ambition nor courted out of selfinterested but rather  it ought to be earned rooted in a sincere desire to serve and carried out with accessibility and integrity PERIOD

I found myself visited with this desire as I sought to serve as the senator for the Class of  a position that I have found to be deeply gratifying PERIOD Having served on the Academic Affairs Committee I have gained value experience about how curricular changes and academic policy and made and executed at Swarthmore PERIOD While on the Intercultural Center Director and Sophomore Class Dean Search Committee I gained a better understanding of the work done by Deans Office the Intercultural Center and on academic advising PERIOD

I have been elated to be on SGO and feel pride at having been a part of the work that has been done thus far but we have so much more to do PERIOD Concerning food though I am happy about the change in the meal plan I continue to feel that change is needed at Sharples  most notably the frequency of pasta bar PERIOD

Academically I would also like to continue the exploration being performed in streamlining requirements to grant students more choices in the classes that they take PERIOD I believe that education is a lifelong allencompassing a uniquely personal experience and I would like to find a way to enhance the ability of students to carve out their educational path while keeping with our values of providing a holistic and broad foundation across disciplines PERIOD This might manifest itself in a reduction of the amount of Ws one requires to graduate PERIOD

On campus being committed to the health of our environment and reducing Swarthmores carbon footprint I admire the educative work that has been done by Swarthmores Green Advisors  especially regarding what can and cannot be recycled PERIOD In this spirit I want to pursue the possibility of reducing the amount of number  and  plastics used at Swarthmore that instead of being recycled are incinerated PERIOD Also more work can be done to increase the amount of recycling bins around campus PERIOD Though newer facilities like Danawell have many options other areas go underserved PERIOD

The most critical part of being a student representative is listening.Therefore I would work to increase the amount of surveys students are allowed to take concerning the issues I have mentioned and many more because Swarthmore student government and Swarthmore writ large do not exist for themselves but for you PERIOD

Swarthmore is my home a place to learn and grow both intellectually and socially and I am immeasurably grateful for the experiences that I have enjoyed here  most of all those talks had with friends late at night or over lunch about politics society and campus life PERIOD As a result the issue that is closest to my heart is campus dialogue PERIOD I firmly believe that an integral part of building community is conversation PERIOD I would like for our student representatives to be more involved in facilitating discussion around the issues that confront the Swarthmore community PERIOD The manifestation of this belief would be for SGO to partner with invested organizations and the Forum for Free Speech to host town halls and debates on those issues PERIOD Whatever the issue or question it should be discussed in front of the student body by the interested parties and moderated by our representatives PERIOD When we disagree we should do so intellectually honestly and passionately but never disagreeably because another part of building community is mutual respect PERIOD

The premise of student government is giving students a voice in the polices and practices that concern them PERIOD I hope that you will help me make yours heard PERIOD If you have any questions comments or ideas email me at dpipkin1swarthmore.edu I cant wait to hear them PERIOD

Warmly David
