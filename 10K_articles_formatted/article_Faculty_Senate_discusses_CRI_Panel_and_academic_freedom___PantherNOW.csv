Faculty Senate is back in session PERIOD

At the top of a rather crowded agenda on Jan PERIOD  was something that happened during the senates recess the Cuban Research Institutes chaotic Cuban Privilege panel PERIOD

Faculty discussed the book signing which became a panel focusing on the disarray that preceded it and the implication for future academic events PERIOD FIU president Ken Jessell answered senators questions PERIOD

If we have something thats controversial why would we want to do it simply as a book signing and having a presentation rather than having a very strong academic dialogue Jessell asked although much of the speech surrounding the event focused little on Dr PERIOD Susan Ecksteins actual research in her book PERIOD

Jessell concentrated most of his answers on the logistics of why FIU ended up changing the event and switching locations PERIOD

There were a lot of issues with the security the ability of Coral Gables to even accommodate the trafficwhat this would mean to Books and Books longer term in terms of loss of business said Jessell within the first ten minutes of the senate PERIOD I cant make decisions on the basis of all of those things but I can make decisions in terms of the safety and security of the university community as well as the broader community and this was a way of accommodating that without diminishing the importance of free speech. however that wasnt the heart of the issue for some faculty members PERIOD Instead they centered on an issue that has been a common theme in recent history academic freedom PERIOD

What concerns me is that in my  years at FIU I had never seen a CRI event changed because of the unpopular opinion among our community said MMC library senator Patricia PereiraPujol PERIOD If the event had started as a panel discussion on what immigration means who was an immigrant who was not what is the differencethen it would have been fine but it wasnt that and it was changed into that to accommodate people whoI believe are not very open to listening to opinions that differ from theirs. if were addressing academic freedom then by all means please have more events like this where we discuss all the different research that is being done and all the different ideas but this was not it. jessell claimed that Eckstein approved the change and that FIU had discussed it with her beforehand PERIOD However Eckstein said in an interview with PantherNOW that that wasnt fully the case PERIOD

I really was not given an option on the format I was told that this was the format that it would take said Eckstein who only communicated with Dr PERIOD Jorge Duany director of the CRI not the presidents office PERIOD I didnt have a choice in who the speaker would be PERIOD They chose him  and I dont know exactly who they is. eckstein said that the way that the other panelist talked was inappropriate given that he hardly touched on her book and she was not given much of a chance to respond to his claims PERIOD Still she said she appreciated FIU giving her the chance to speak and the security and effort administration put into the evening PERIOD

Jessell promised senators that the handling of the December panel was a onetime thing and that it would not be the standard for future events PERIOD

Lets not make this a precedent said Jessell PERIOD This is a onetime event and lets try to be more deliberate in what were doing. yet again the concerns seemed lost in translation  it wasnt the speed with which things were changed or the venue itself but more so the inability of Eckstein to speak freely that concerned senators PERIOD

Now it would seem that any organization that is loud enough could force us into doing a big event even handed presentation and that sort of goes to academic freedom said CARTA Senator Neil Reisner PERIOD

Reisner proposed a resolution to urge the administration from intervening in academic events in the future objecting to administrators having done so with the CRI panel PERIOD

After a few minor adjustments to the language mainly clarifying the specific concerns the senate had the resolution passed PERIOD

Be it resolved the Senate urges the administration to refrain from such interventions in the future and ask for explanations on this action in this instance stated the resolution PERIOD

After the discussion with Jessell ended senators ran through the rest of the agenda starting with a report from Chair Deanne Butchey PERIOD

Her report varied in topics from faculty participation in commencement to trends in using AI for academic misconduct and exemptions for exam and assignment materials from public disclosure PERIOD

After those Chair Deanne Butchey concluded her report with requests for information from Floridas public university system about how resources are being used on programs connected to diversity equity and inclusion as well as critical race theory PERIOD

The advisory council of the faculty Senate held an emergency meeting last week to make a comprehensive statement made by the organization said Butchey PERIOD We feel that a statement by the body at large would be more impactful than numerous individuals PERIOD Once the working group completes the statement we will share but it is a rapidly evolving situation. provost Elizabeth Bejar had a few updates of her own in her report notably that the search and screening committee has been appointed for the SIPA dean search which had its first meeting that week PERIOD

We selected Isaacs and Miller as our search firm and Dr PERIOD Rosenbaumhas graciously agreed to facilitate a listening session with the SIPA faculty as well as search and screening committee members and that will be held on Thursday the nineteenth said Bejar PERIOD Our goal is to have an expeditious but increased efficacy in the process of our search and selection for a dean. fIU will use the same search firm for the library dean search finalizing the details of that search in the near future PERIOD

The senate also passed several motions approving several new programs
