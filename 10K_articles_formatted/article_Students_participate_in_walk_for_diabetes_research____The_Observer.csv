Mel Flanagan  Monday September  

Instead of sleeping in after a victorious football Saturday  students got out of bed early Sunday morning to raise money for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation JDRF PERIOD

The students participated in the JDRF Diabetes walk at nearby Beutter Park in Mishawaka PERIOD Junior Joe Williams helped to organize Team Notre Dame PERIOD

Im a Type  diabetic Williams said PERIOD So were a lot of other people doing the walk or they knew people with Type . while  students actually participated in the walk Williams said many more donated to the team through a Facebook group and JDRFs website PERIOD

In total we raised over  for the foundation Williams said PERIOD It was really great. junior Gina ORiordan suggested Notre Dame participate in the walk last semester PERIOD

I usually do the walk at home with my family ORiordan said PERIOD It started with my grade school and then in high school we started a family team. the event also included games of cornhole and free massages Williams said PERIOD

There were also a lot of companies there representing and displaying some of their diabetesrelated projects he said PERIOD

Athletes from the mens hockey team the womens tennis team and the womens lacrosse team also attended the event to support Team Notre Dame PERIOD

ORiordan said Notre Dames firsttime participation in the event was a success PERIOD

Its always fun because you raise money obviously for a cure but its also nice because you get to see the support you have ORiordan said PERIOD You see everyone really wants to be there for you. this year Williams and ORiordan founded Notre Dames Diabetes Support Group which helps diabetic students as they transition from high school to college. thats really the reason the group started PERIOD I want to support people with diabetes Williams said PERIOD Its really helpful to have someone there to talk to. although spreading the word about the walk was difficult for the fledgling group ORiordan said the event would probably be bigger in coming years PERIOD

A lot of kids dont share that they have diabetes ORiordan said PERIOD Its not one of those things you can look and know PERIOD I think once kids know that students and their friends have diabetes theyll definitely come out and have a good time. the first meeting for the Diabetes Support Group will be Monday at  p.m PERIOD in Room  of Saint Liam Hall PERIOD
