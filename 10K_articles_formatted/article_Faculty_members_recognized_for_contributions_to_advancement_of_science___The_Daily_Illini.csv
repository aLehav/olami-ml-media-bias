Four professors at the University were recognized as fellows by the American Association for the Advancement of Science for the contributions to their respective scientific fields PERIOD

Narayana Aluru professor in mechanical science and engineering William Gropp professor in computer science and Andrew Leakey and Ray Ming professors in plant biology will be formally honored for their achievements at the  AAAS annual meeting in Washington D.C. along with  other scientists PERIOD

Leakey said it is important for organizations such as AAAS to recognize those who have made great contributions to a scientific field because the public should be aware of what scientists do and what they contribute to society PERIOD

Im very grateful and appreciative to all the people who Ive worked with that made it possible Leakey said PERIOD It reflects the effort of a really big group of people who work within my research team as well as lots of colleagues here at the University of Illinois and elsewhere. leakey said he appreciates working with his colleagues at the University and the resources the University provides PERIOD



He said his career is driven by his questions and selfmotivation and there are always opportunities to work with different people and constantly learn PERIOD

Mings career in plant biology began because of his interest in the origin and diversity of life PERIOD He focuses on researching the principles of morphology and the general functions of life and aims to improve food nutrition and quality of life through his contributions to agriculture PERIOD

Ming said in addition to being honored to be among fellow accomplished AAAS fellows he is relieved AAAS fellows see their work as worthwhile PERIOD

Ming also said raising awareness of scientific research is important PERIOD

Awards like this would encourage students to pursue careers in science and engineering as they would be shown how scientific research is relevant to our daily life as well as addressing issues in society or the physical world that appeared to be unapproachable in the past Ming said in an email PERIOD

Gropps director forNational Center for Supercomputing Applications saidfellowships or associations like the AAAS are important because it is interdisciplinary and includes all fields in science PERIOD

Gropps said he pursued a career in computer science because its so fun to learn how things work. it is an honor to be recognized as a fellow but the fellowship does not come with any funding he said PERIOD

I do continue to support the mission of AAAS he said PERIOD Being designated as a fellow helps identify you as someone who is recognized by your peers in your field. gropps said the AAAS fellowship has two important components to it PERIOD

First it recognizes and rewards people in their contributing field and it also communicates to people outside the recipients field that they have been judged by their peers as an expert in that specific field PERIOD

Its some way to know this person is judged by peers as an expert in this area Gropps said PERIOD

Narayana Aluru did not respond at time of publication PERIOD
