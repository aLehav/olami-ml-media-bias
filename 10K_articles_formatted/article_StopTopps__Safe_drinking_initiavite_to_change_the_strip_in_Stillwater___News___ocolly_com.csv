StopTopps foil stickers in the female bathroom inside of Outlaws PERIOD

A foil sticker holds the power to save someones life PERIOD

Audrey Fleschute ignored thenave assumption that all college kids wait until they are  to drink alcohol PERIOD The speaker of the senate for the Student Government Association said as incredible as her position in the association is there was still something missing in her personal life PERIOD Fleschute wanted to make a change PERIOD

On a trip to Lawrence Kansas last fall Fleschute learned about how Kansas University promotes safety among parties as a dry campus PERIOD KUs Student Government initiatives inspired Fleschute to start her own project The StopTopps cup stickers PERIOD

The stickers can be placed on top of peoples drinks and a straw can be poked through it PERIOD The goal is to protect drinkers from being drugged while out partying PERIOD Fleschute who is getting her degree in political science got in contact with Outlaws a bar in Stillwater and introduced her idea to the donor PERIOD

I just wanted it to be an option Fleschute said PERIOD Im not looking at people who commit those crimes PERIOD Im looking at the establishments that facilitate the space where these things happen PERIOD Thats why I went to the bars. in the U.S.  of college students experience rape or sexual assaultthrough force violence or incapacitation and in terms of drugfacilitated sexual assault alcohol is the No PERIOD  substancefor assailants according to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network PERIOD

I feel like we highlight the negatives of partying a lot but maybe we should say We know people party and thats okWe just want you to be safe so here are some things we can do to help you do that. fleschute said the stickers will not make people drink less but it can help avoid malicious intentions to follow through PERIOD The foil allows customers to know if someone tried to peel off the side or bend the foil making it possible for the person drinking to stay alert and get a different drink PERIOD The stickers come with a QR code that takes the person to a website PERIOD

Its a website free of nonsense Fleschute said PERIOD There is no branding PERIOD All it shows is how to use the stickers what is its goal how to tell if youve been drugged and what are the next steps. kelsie Wood a junior at OSU said she feels unsafe most of the time she goes out in public especially when there is drinking involved PERIOD Wood said she is cautious and tries to make sure nothing will happen to her PERIOD

This idea gives a safer feel to the bar Wood said PERIOD Most women dont feel safe so its good to hear there are people putting in some effort to help. the owner of Outlaws Willies and JR Murphys said he is supporting Fleschutes initiative and this process to help protect all the customers PERIOD

After spreading  stickers around the strip Fleschute went out to the bars to see her project come to life PERIOD

I saw a lot of moms last weekend because of admitted students day Fleschute said PERIOD We started talking about the stickers and everyone loved them. fleschute is running a onewoman show and her next step is to go from the foil stickers to the scrunchie version a fabric cup cover that people can wear on their wrists while they are not drinking PERIOD SGA has funded Fleschutes initial project but moving foward funding will be even trickier PERIOD

But whats great is I have not heard a single person tell me that they thought it was bad Fleschute said PERIOD Which is good enough for me there is nothing wrong with setting boundaries and going after what we want. your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers",StopTopps: Safe drinking initiavite to change the strip in Stillwater | News | ocolly.com,Oklahoma State University
