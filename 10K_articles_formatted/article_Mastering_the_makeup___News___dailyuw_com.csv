Jay explained that the liquid latex is paintlike when it goes on PERIOD Once it dries you can mold it to create the desired shape and texture for your look PERIOD Then he suggests using one of the color wheels sold at Champion to finish off PERIOD The wheels come in several color combinations for burns blisters bruises and more PERIOD

Egashira had some tips for bruises as well using products that women may already have in their makeup collection PERIOD
