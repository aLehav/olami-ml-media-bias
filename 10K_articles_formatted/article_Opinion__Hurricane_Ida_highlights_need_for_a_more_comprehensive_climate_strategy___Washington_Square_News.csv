Hurricane Ida dumped record levels of rain across New York City on Sept PERIOD  shutting down packed streets and highways and flooding subway stations PERIOD Damage and tragedy overwhelmed the city as officials declared the first flash flood emergency in its history PERIOD At least  people were killed in New York City primarily from drowning within cars and basement apartments PERIOD

Humaninduced climate change ensures that such extreme weather events will continue to increase in likelihood and intensity PERIOD New York City must increase its investment in comprehensive natural disaster resiliency infrastructure to adapt to future catastrophes like Ida PERIOD

The next mayor of New York likely Democratic nominee Eric Adams will inherit the urgent task of tackling climate change preparing the city to resist extreme weather effects PERIOD In a televised appearance Adams admitted that the flooding was a wakeup call. he pointed to the need for better infrastructure solutions and innovations  and yet much of his public climate plan remains brief and uncertain PERIOD

Adams climate agenda released last Earth Day is only seven pages long and lacking in specifics PERIOD His goals include increasing reliance on renewable energy and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels increasing interest and investment in communitybased solar power projects decreasing dependence on peaker plants  which run when there is a demand spike for electricity  and implementing a green economy curriculum in high schools and community colleges PERIOD While all of these goals are important there are major flaws PERIOD His lack of detailed metrics and structured timelines for pursuing sustainability is troublesome PERIOD His stances on several local climate policies  such as banning gas in newly developed or renovated apartment buildings or enforcing energy efficiency  are still hazy PERIOD

Investment in climate resiliency infrastructure must be a political priority for the future mayor PERIOD In light of the current mayors minimal support for boosting coastal resiliency across outer boroughs it will be important to hold Adams accountable for his progress toward resiliency structures within said regions PERIOD The support he garnered in these outer boroughs was crucial to both his primary win and campaign messaging PERIOD Given his acknowledgement that the impacts of climate change have been most severe in historically disenfranchised neighborhoods inaction on this matter will speak volumes PERIOD

Another key point to watch will be Adams approach to corporate responsibility PERIOD Currently buildings emit over  of the citys greenhouse gas emissions PERIOD Local Law  which will require largescale buildings to cut emissions is set to take effect in  PERIOD Corporate and landlord compliance must be enforced in order to realize the ambitious policies the climate crisis demands PERIOD

In the past Adams has actively consulted with the real estate and business elite PERIOD The direction he takes in enforcing emission standards will be a crucial signal of his priorities regarding climate policy and relationships with the private sector PERIOD

As the likely successor to a city increasingly threatened by climate catastrophe Adams must release a more detailed climate strategy PERIOD If Adams wins the mayoral election this fall the spotlight on Adams must intensify emphasizing the urgency of investing in necessary climate resiliency and accountability infrastructure PERIOD
