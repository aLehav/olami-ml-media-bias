After dropping the season opener to the Quinnipiac Bobcats the Eastern womens rugby team will host a select group of Wisconsin AllStars at Lakeside Field at  p.m PERIOD on Saturday PERIOD



The Wisconsin AllStars are a group of players from  different schools in the University of Wisconsin system and they will be playing together and meeting each other for the first time this week PERIOD Eastern coach Frank Graziano said that gives them the advantage PERIOD

They just started school this week so this is their actual first week of practice Graizano said PERIOD We are excited about playing them PERIOD We have never lost to them yet so this should be a good game PERIOD If we could stay in it where all of the sudden the game is close at halftime the girls will feel really good. senior Shelby Pilch said she expects the Wisconsin AllStars to come ready to battle but the biggest challenge will be the Panthers own play PERIOD

It is all about grit and determination and our willingness to improve Pilch said PERIOD We have to execute the number of things that coach has taught us. graziano said the Panthers simply need to get better at running the ball and also work on their openfield tackling PERIOD

We didnt do well controlling the tempo of the game Graziano said PERIOD This week in practice we have been working on running the ball a lot PERIOD We need to strike a balance. pilch said there are a lot of positives the Panthers can build on from last week heading into this game with the Wisconsin AllStars PERIOD

The first five minutes of the game couldnt have started any better for us Pilch said PERIOD If we expand on that from the last game we will be able to create more opportunities for ourselves. the Panthers are looking to play the same type of style as they did against the Bobcats PERIOD

We didnt quite execute that against Quinnipiac Graziano said PERIOD We had the ball inplay too much and that is why we were out of position PERIOD Quinnipiac just ran down the field at will. the Panthers did have the advantage last week in lineouts and scrums and they are hoping to do that again this week PERIOD Pilch said the key to winning this game is communication and to simply execute the basics PERIOD

After their worst loss in team history last weekend the Panthers already have put the game behind them and moved on to this week PERIOD

They played their first game now its time to move on into our season and start to get better each week Graziano said PERIOD Week two is right in front of us PERIOD Lets go ahead and have a good game against them and give ourselves a chance. bob Reynolds can be reached at  or emailprotected PERIOD
