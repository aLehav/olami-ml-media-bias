The most feared part of freshman year is not freshman chemistry or the community bathrooms  its the dreaded 

But have no fear UGA students PERIOD There is a place that offers just the cure for those dinner rollinduced rolls that have begun forming around your midsection Ramsey PERIOD

In order to experience Ramsey at its best there are some things you need to know PERIOD

The best time to go to Ramsey is right before dinner or right after dark PERIOD Whether you are working out before an ECV protein fest or waiting until the sun goes down to join in on the game of musical cars being played in East deck these times are optimal for working out PERIOD Theres no better gym than a crowded gym PERIOD

When getting ready to workout remember some essentials PERIOD The outfit is crucial PERIOD

For guys who are heading out to get swoll sleeves are a big no PERIOD You are working out you are going to get big your muscles will simply bust out of any sleeves you try to wear so go ahead and cut em off PERIOD

For girls there are a few more options PERIOD Start with the Nike Tempo shorts which come in a wide variety of colors and designs plus builtin underwear  bonus

The gym is a prime spot to draw attention to yourself PERIOD You are working out getting sweaty hot and tired  when have you looked any better Bright tanks and big headbands are sure to turn some heads PERIOD

There are a wide array of machines and rooms to choose from in Ramsey but choose the wrong room and it can be social suicide PERIOD

The front lifting room has strict standards for working out as its patrons are mostly males all of whom exhibit a certain penchant for getting yoked PERIOD Dont know what getting yoked means You probably shouldnt be in this room then PERIOD

Every machine in this room is specifically designed and precisely used for the common goal of any well respected ladies man to get huge PERIOD Heavy weights high reps and a clear view of the mirror are all important parts of a good workout routine in this room PERIOD

If you should venture in make sure you bring your bros to pump you up PERIOD Theres no closer tie than that between workout buddies PERIOD They sweat together bleed together theyve got each others backs on that rep and theyll spot each other on that lift PERIOD

This is your best boy at the gym PERIOD Just make sure to avoid direct eye contact and bring separate iPods  you wouldnt want things to get weird PERIOD

The second workout room at Ramsey is designed to give you the peace of mind that you are still in shape despite your lack of cardio and participation in organized sports and refusal to walk anywhere further than the nearest bus stop PERIOD

This room is ideal for females looking to work out as it is filled with machines ab mats and the greatest gift to college girls since yoga pants  the elliptical PERIOD

The greatest feature about the stationary cardio machine lining the back wall of this room is its multitasking potential PERIOD You can watch TV text read talk on the phone eat a sandwich paint your nails and finish your homework all while working out PERIOD Genius PERIOD

For those who prefer to avoid heightened heart rates or hard breathing there are plenty of workout machines that simply require a push pull or kick of a bar a few times PERIOD

Dont like working out alone Not a problem the gym is the perfect place for a date  theres nothing cuter than a sweaty couple handinhand strolling the halls of the gym PERIOD

Those who sweat together stay together PERIOD

Finally the postworkout recovery is a key part of training so conveniently the University put its best dining hall right next door PERIOD

Dont bother showering or even changing PERIOD Wearing your sweaty workout clothes shows everyone that Yes you work out and yes you can down three banana flips after two straight hours of plyometrics PERIOD

Whether you are trying to avoid the  or bulk up for the ladies Ramsey has a place for everyone PERIOD

Just dont forget your mini towel PERIOD
