Air pollution has always been an issue in Asia  northern India in particular PERIOD The complication exacerbated over the past years however during which the burning of biomass adulteration of fuel vehicular exhaust omissions and a number of other factors have pushed the air quality of the New Delhi metropolitan area to beyond toxic standards impelling the Indian government to declare a national emergency PERIOD



In particular the city and its outskirts have grappled with an Air Quality Index AQI value of upwards of  in the past weeks choking its nearly  million citizens preventing the takeoffs and landings of aircraft and resulting in the immediate closures of schools and offices PERIOD To put this figure into perspective the AQI value of the Town of Hempstead is around  PERIOD That of Beijing the Chinese capital often considered to be a cradle of particulate contamination clocks in at slightly above  PERIOD



New Delhis thick smog doesnt just affect the city itself PERIOD The entire subcontinents economy and livelihood continue to suffer due to a lack of action to curb air pollution in New Delhi PERIOD Wind currents blow deleterious toxins in a southward direction harming not just people but also marine wildlife and creatures that inhabit the pelagic zone struggle to perform photosynthesis PERIOD Many of my own family members who reside in Tamil Nadu the subcontinents southernmost state are beginning to face the brunt of New Delhis negligence in tackling this problem PERIOD



The Indian government does maintain the Central Pollution Control Board an organization under the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change which serves to identify and mitigate pollutants in the air and in water bodies PERIOD Although the board researches and monitors pollution within the country it has little jurisdiction to enforce the policies it champions PERIOD The vast majority of Indian cities continue to violate the air quality targets and standards the organization sets forth a phenomenon attributable to rampant corruption PERIOD



Given that the population density of India far exceeds that of any modern nation it comes as no surprise that transportation is a key concern for many PERIOD Although public transit systems operate at the municipal level much of the rural populace of the country purchases cars and motorcycles PERIOD They rely on them as their primary means of transportation given the scarcity of road or railway infrastructure in and around villages PERIOD It is this same contingent of individuals that tends to face financial struggles and to whom cheaper fuel is often enticing PERIOD Such fuel however  which usually takes the form of unsanctioned adulterations of diesel  emits larger and more dangerous amounts of vehicular exhaust when burned PERIOD Ordinary smoke can be fumigated but the synergy of such smoke with sulfur oxides creates a much more perilous situation PERIOD Civilian complaints about this dynamic are swept under the rug by politicians and businessmen who profit exorbitantly from the presence of unclean air in Indian cities PERIOD We shouldnt tolerate this sort of behavior PERIOD



The burning of biomass also contributes to a significant chunk of the nations air pollution PERIOD A  article published in the Times of India found that the incineration of biomass accounts for nearly a quarter of the countrys total carbon and sulfur dioxide emissions a statistic that has likely increased since then PERIOD The practice peaks around the harvest season when agricultural workers dispose of waste en masse PERIOD The onset of Diwali another periodic source of air pollution brings with it plenty of firecrackers which although inconsequential on their own amount to smog so intense that visibility is frequently obstructed PERIOD



A number of factors influence the current circumstances afflicting New Delhi PERIOD To most Americans pollution in India isnt all too important PERIOD Per the Office of the United States Trade Representative though India was the ninthlargest trading partner of the United States last year as the Indianorigin population of the United States increases steadily PERIOD



Pollution affects the economy and climate both of which are factors that influence the United States policies and biospheres PERIOD Global climate change is a real threat and we must remind ourselves that while India is a member of the Paris Agreement the marble exterior of the Taj Mahal one of the countrys most wellknown landmarks grows grayer by the month PERIOD
