UMaines Student Newspaper since  PERIOD

This past Sunday the Academy Awards proved that there may actually be a legitimate reason for it to exist PERIOD The ceremony was complete with all the usual fanfare celebrities made fumbling speeches with vaguely political messages everyone explained who they were wearing and nominees forced smiles as they watched the winners of their categories get called up to the stage PERIOD Outside of the usual pomp and circumstance there were two very clear anomalies which lent the generally indulgent proceedings something akin to legitimacy Eminem showed up and performed the only song of his everyone knows Lose Yourself and a foreign language film Parasite won Best Picture PERIOD

Parasite a South Korean film directed by Bong JoonHo not only walked away with a win in the Best Picture category but also in Best International Feature Best Original Screenplay and Best Director PERIOD This is a significant win for the South Korean film industry especially considering that it has only been in existence as it stands today since the early nineties after the countrys move to a democratic government PERIOD JoonHo himself was stunned after receiving more than one Oscar as he only prepared for one speech let alone four PERIOD

Some might suggest that this is a big step forward in terms of acknowledging foreign films in America but caution is necessary when equating the members of the Academy that vote on the award categories with the views of everyday citizens PERIOD According to Good Morning America of the approximately  members of the Academy in  just  were women and  were people of color PERIOD These demographic numbers and typically white and male nominations for the awards resulted in an uproar on Twitter with the hashtag OscarsSoWhite trending again PERIOD It often seems as though the Academy is making a conscious effort to appease the public rather than actually reflect it PERIOD

What is significant is the effect of the publicity that JoonHos film has received resulting from his films numerous awards PERIOD Although the film is already available on DVD and for streaming The Guardian reports its oneday ticket sales rose as much as  compared to the same day a week before and it is expected to soon become the fourth most successful foreign language film released in U.S PERIOD theaters PERIOD New York Times contributor Sandra Garcia asserts that part of the reason that the public is willing to pay a foreign language film so much attention is that many streaming platforms like Netflix provide access to an immense library of subtitled content thus providing many Americans with an avenue for getting their feet wet before they sit through an entire subtitled featurelength film PERIOD

In essence the Oscars are an indulgent ceremony by the Academy for the Academy but its sheer power of to popularize a film that has been largely considered as having a niche audience is remarkable and worth taking note of PERIOD According to the U.S PERIOD Census Bureau while about half of the entire worlds population can converse in two or more languages the same can only be said for  of Americans PERIOD So while I will never accept the idea that the Oscars represent some higher sense of what a good film is hopefully the award can encourage moviegoers to seek out foreignlanguage films PERIOD Perhaps one day audiences wont be deterred from consuming great movies because of the subtitle barrier PERIOD
