OU Chief COVID Officer Dr PERIOD Dale Bratzler wears his mask Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

OU Chief COVID Officer Dr PERIOD Dale Bratzler andDr.Philip C PERIOD Mantor professor of surgery and vice chair of operations at OU Medicine said in a Friday update Oklahoma is experiencing its highest positive testing rate since the pandemic began PERIOD

Bratzler said this week has been a real peak in the pandemic with  new cases being confirmed this week and  Oklahomans dying from COVID19 PERIOD

One thing that really jumped out at me was that we did see a reduction in testing last week there were about  less tests done last week than there had been for the previous several weeks Bratzler said PERIOD But the important thing Ive noticed in the first four days of the week is that . percent of all of the tests that have been done have been positive which is the highest positive rate Ive seen since the start of the pandemic PERIOD 

He said this reduction can be explained by the ice storm and the lack of power that caused testing sites to close PERIOD

The number of hospitalizations has also increased according to Bratzler PERIOD He said Oklahoma had more than  patients in the hospital in the past three days PERIOD

We know the mortality rate from COVID19  particularly when youre sick enough to be hospitalized and in an ICU  is very high PERIOD And were going to see more deaths in our state Bratzler said PERIOD Several weeks ago the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation had predicted that Oklahoma would have up to  cases and  deaths by Thanksgiving PERIOD Were going to have that many deaths by next week PERIOD So clearly the pandemic continues were not out of the woods by any means PERIOD Were seeing substantial community spread of the virus. asked about the impacts ofTier  rules  which ban people from socializing with anyone outside their household or support bubble in any indoor setting  Mantor said it is now recognized that the spread of COVID19 is not happening in hospitals PERIOD

Its not happening in doctors offices its happening out in the communities Mantor said PERIOD And so it depends on what the public does to try to protect themselves and us to prevent the spread of disease PERIOD Thats the telling point of if our numbers are going up or not. bratzler said it is quite likely the Tulsa region will see the same type of growth in cases as Oklahoma City and the metroplex PERIOD

Bratzler also commented on the exemption to normal state rules which nowallows public city council boards and commissions to meet virtually due to the pandemic and itsexpiration which according to the Tulsa World will be either when Oklahoma Gov PERIOD Kevin Stitts state of emergency ends or Nov PERIOD  whichever comes first PERIOD

Any time you bring people together indoors in a closed setting you increase the risk of transmission of the virus Bratzler said PERIOD So Im hoping that if we dont see an extension of that exemption the city council will do everything they can to promote physical distancing and require masks in those meetings PERIOD I know Ive talked to a number of city councils that are looking at ways to spread out the council members and others so that theyre not close to others. the doctors also talked about how rural counties have higher incidence rates than most urban counties in the state PERIOD

Theres no question that as cases go up in the communities the percent positives in the rural areas are higher Mantor said PERIOD Those patients that cant be taken care of in their local community hospital are looking for higher levels of care PERIOD So that will include both the surrounding areas which are Oklahoma City as well as Tulsa. mantor said this will affect the Oklahoma community greatly as it impacts doctors ability to care for patients who have the virus and also their ability to care for Oklahoma patients who have cancer have had bad accidents need trauma care or have heart disease PERIOD

Bratzler also talked about the relation between the flu and COVID19 PERIOD

He said there is satisfactory research from the southern hemisphere that has shown in countries that have broad mask mandates and have heavily promoted the influenza vaccination the flu season was less severe because of many of the interventions being implemented against spreading COVID19 PERIOD

Remember both the virus that causes COVID19 and the influenza are both respiratory viruses that spread via droplets from one mouth to another Bratzler said PERIOD So wearing a mask physical distancing enhanced sanitation hand hygiene will prevent both diseases. bratzler also said he thinks it is likely that some people are reinfected with COVID19 PERIOD

The cases I know about had different sets of symptoms PERIOD Some have had less severe disease and some have had more severe disease with the second episodes Bratzler said PERIOD One thing that we know is that your antibody levels against COVID19 tend to drop off relatively rapidly PERIOD So we dont know how long immunity may last. the doctors also said those in the health care and public health system are concerned about the upcoming holiday season and how people will follow safety measures PERIOD

If you bring people who dont live with you into your home you increase your chance of getting the infection PERIOD Studies have shown that if youre in a household with somebody whos infected you have a  to  percent chance of getting the infection yourself Braztler said PERIOD Just remember that in households most people dont wear masks PERIOD If the weather is nice  and sometimes it is in Oklahoma  do those activities outdoors if possible separate wear a mask when youre not eating and you can reduce some of the risk of transmission. mantor also talked about the stress impact on mental health professionals during the pandemic PERIOD

I think those who are currently the nurses and physicians respiratory therapists and all of those that are in ICU taking care of large numbers of critically ill patients all have a heightened level of concern Mantor said PERIOD I think its made more stressful by whats happening in the community PERIOD So its the idea that we dont see an end  we only see an increase. mantor said local hospitals chief medical officers CEOs and infectious disease specialists are all working together to provide the best care to patients PERIOD

But being successful requires resources and our resources are finite Mantor said PERIOD We are trying to be creative and create new beds with our new bed tower for example PERIOD So there are certainly things that were doing as a medical community PERIOD But at some point weve reached our limit theres nothing else we could do PERIOD We cant create new beds theres no other therapy thats come up and until we have a vaccine that we know works we are in a situation where its a problem PERIOD So my message is that hospitals cant fix the pandemic hospitals and doctors are not going to make the pandemic go away. the doctors said that while a vaccine is not yet released safety measures such as wearing a mask social distancing and handwashing will help stop the pandemic PERIOD

So I will just implore you we have to be a big part of the solution Mantor said PERIOD Hospitals arent fixing this pandemic the community is who has to fix it. robust news organizations like ours generate civic good that informs improves and inspires communities PERIOD For those invested in OU and Norman OU Daily uniquely has
