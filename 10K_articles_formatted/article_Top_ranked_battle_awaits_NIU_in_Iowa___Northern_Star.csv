Last Novembers Super Tuesday carried Bill Clinton all the way to the top as in the White house PERIOD

Last Tuesdays NIU upset of thenNo PERIOD  De Paul carried the Huskies all the way to the top as in this weeks Associated Press Top  poll at No PERIOD  PERIOD

Now will another Tuesday prove to be super for Jane AlbrightDieterles quicklyrising womens basketball squad

That question will be answered in earnest at  tonight when NIU  faces its toughest challenge evera matchup with thirdranked Iowa  at Iowa City PERIOD

Although the Huskies have been winners of their last eight games problems await them in their quest to receive even more national recognition PERIOD

First the defending Big Ten Conference champions are well on their way to repeating league bragging rights with a  mark this year PERIOD Indiana which was No PERIOD  last week was the Hawkeyes latest victim falling  as Toni Foster . points a game tallied  points PERIOD

Second the Hawkeyes have been led into battle each and every night the last  years by C PERIOD Vivian Stringer who is Iowas alltime winningest coach in both mens and womens basketball with a record of  PERIOD

In addition Stringer places fifth nationally for wins by an active coach with a 21year overall mark of  and third in career winning percentage . pERIOD
