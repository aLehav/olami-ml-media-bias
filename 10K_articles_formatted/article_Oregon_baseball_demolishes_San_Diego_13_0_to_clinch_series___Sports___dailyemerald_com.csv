Ducks outfielder  Colby Shade hits a drive to center field PERIOD The University of Oregon Ducks defeat Xavier University  at PK Park in Eugene Ore. on February seventeenth  PERIOD Kai KanzerEmerald

Its the day Oregon has been waiting for PERIOD

Offense has been a tough commodity to come by for the Ducks despite a talented stack of names in the lineup each day PERIOD Early in the season theyve scratched out some wins and fell flat in some losses PERIOD Even in their wins they havent felt like the offense has fully been there PERIOD

On Saturday it was fully there PERIOD

Oregon exploded for a  win over San Diego winning its third straight to clinch the fourgame series PERIOD Colby Shade led the way with six RBIs while Tanner Smith and Sabin Ceballos also hit homers PERIOD Jackson Pace made things stressfree on the mound capping a dominant wellrounded performance from the Ducks PERIOD

It was a complete game head coach Mark Wasikowski said PERIOD Its hard to have a lot of complaints on what you saw today PERIOD It was a tremendous effort. wasikowski and multiple players professed that despite the chilly weather despite the rain there was a different energy at PK Park from the time everyone arrived at the stadium PERIOD Pace said he felt like something good was gonna happen today. everybody was like The weather is gonna be what it is PERIOD Its gonna be cold PERIOD Its gonna be wet for BP Smith said PERIOD Lets just try to have as much fun and be as crazy as we can. pace was locked in from the beginning PERIOD He wasnt overpowering throwing no harder than the high 80s but he worked quickly and was aided by Oregons precise positioning PERIOD The game moved at a fast pace on both sides of the ball as neither team scored through the first three innings PERIOD

Particularly in the fourth inning the Toreros hit three hard line drives into the mitts of Duck outfielders PERIOD The Oregon bench erupted in praise of assistant coach Marcus Hinkles defensive alignments PERIOD

We micromanage that stuff like crazy Wasikowski said PERIOD Coach Hinks an awesome coach PERIOD The guys unbelievable and the time that he puts into spray charting and defensive positioning and all that kind of stuff is immense PERIOD And so today was a day where we were rewarded for his great effort. for the third straight game Drew Cowley gave Oregon the lead with a clutch hit PERIOD He broke the scoreless tie in the fourth inning with a bloop single that scored Ceballos who had laced a strong double to the leftcenter field gap PERIOD With two outs Bennett Thompson came in clutch with his first hit of the year poking a grounder through the left side to make it  PERIOD

The Ducks broke it open in the fifth PERIOD Smith got things started with a single Rikuu Nishida laid down a bunt and Ceballos walked to load the bases PERIOD Cowleys magic ran out as he popped up but Jacob Walsh lined a single off the third basemans glove PERIOD Walsh has started to see the ball better over the last couple days PERIOD

Hes gonna play in the major leagues someday if he continues to improve and progress like we think he will Wasikowski said of Walsh PERIOD Hes an awesome kid. san Diego reliever Ivran Romero took over for Garrett Rennie and Shade greeted him rudely by ripping one into the left field corner PERIOD It cleared the bases giving Oregon a  lead PERIOD

Pace nearly threw a perfect sixth inning but with two outs a ball took an unlucky bounce off the third base bag PERIOD Pace briefly fell out of his rhythm and he issued a walk PERIOD On the next batter Smith made a great catch but it was nullified as a balk was called on Pace PERIOD On the very next pitch another ball was hit to left field and Smith dived and made an even better catch PERIOD

Just mayhem Smith said PERIOD Credit to the preparation and being out in the outfield with Waz every day. pace was quick to admit to his mistake on the play but credited Smith for helping him keep his composure PERIOD

I definitely rolled through it he said PERIOD I dont even know why I did it That was  the right call PERIOD And thankfully Tanner Smith had my back on that and made an amazing play. smith did it all on Saturday PERIOD Immediately after his fielding showcase he led off the bottom of the sixth with his first home run of the year PERIOD That set off another offensive outburst for Oregon PERIOD Walsh recorded his second RBI single of the day and Shade complemented his earlier threerun double with a threerun homer to make it  PERIOD

I was talking to Tanner I think its definitely the furthest one Ive ever hit Shade said PERIOD I dont think Im really a home run guy but maybe thatll change after that. ceballos added another homer for good measure hitting a tworun shot in the seventh to make it  PERIOD It was the fifth time Ceballos reached base in as many attempts PERIOD

After Pace went the first six innings fellow freshmen Grayson Grinsell Dylan McShane and Logan Olson finished it out capping the dominant victory PERIOD

Those are some of my best friends Pace said PERIOD I love seeing them go out there and do their thing and just tear guys up PERIOD Its great. oregon will look to keep the offensive momentum alive on Sunday as it goes for a fourgame sweep of San Diego PERIOD First pitch is scheduled for noon PERIOD

We had a good day and now its time to settle ourselves and get ourselves back grounded to where we can come back tomorrow and try to do something special Wasikowski said PERIOD
