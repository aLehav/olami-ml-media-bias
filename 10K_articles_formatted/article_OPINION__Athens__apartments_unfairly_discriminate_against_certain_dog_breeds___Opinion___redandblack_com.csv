Being an animal lover I take it to heart when I hear about people being discriminated against because of the breed of their dog PERIOD Insurance companies apartment complexes and even entire cities place restrictions on dogs that have arbitrarily been deemed as dangerous

These restrictions have been set in place by people that are only half educated on these supposed dangerous breeds PERIOD

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals does not back up breedrestricting laws PERIOD They see that it is nearly impossible to cast blame on a particular breed of dog PERIOD Whether it be from negligence from the owner or some other contributing factor pinpointing a specific breed of dog that is more likely to be aggressive is impossible PERIOD

One of the most famously dangerous breeds is the pit bull a label which can refer to a number of breeds including the American Staffordshire Terrier and the American Pit Bull Terrier PERIOD However according to the American Temperament Test Society . percent of American Pit Bull Terriers and . percent of American Staffordshire Terriers passed their temperament tests PERIOD

In  pit bulls caused  deaths PERIOD In contrast according to the CDC approximately  people die from excessive alcohol consumption each year PERIOD This means you are  times more likely to die from drinking than from a pit bull PERIOD

Despite the relative safety of pit bulls many places still place restrictions on them PERIOD Athens local Stacey Tereskiewicz shares my opinions on breed restrictions PERIOD She has encountered many issues trying to find a residence in Athens because she owns a pit bull PERIOD

When moving out I was turned down by everyone it seemed like PERIOD I only found two places that would rent to me because I had a pit bull as a pet Tereskiewicz said PERIOD

Pit bulls are not the only supposedly dangerous breeds that are discriminated against PERIOD

When I was moving into my first apartment I was turned away because I had a rottweiler said Aaron Ballard an Athens local PERIOD They said my dog was a large aggressive breed of dog. people are likely afraid of these allegedly dangerous dogs because of the bad reputation they have received from the public PERIOD Many of these breeds especially pit bulls are known for dog fights and people are fearful of the breed for that reason PERIOD

However they may be easily bred for dogfighting not because they are violent but rather out of loyalty PERIOD According to the American Kennel Club these dogs are courageous and strong a peopleoriented dog that thrives when he is made part of the family and given a job to do. they are eager to please their owners so they do as they are taught to do.According to the Humane Society these dogs are bred for the sole purpose of dog fighting and they are expected to fight to the death PERIOD These dogs are fighting because of negligence from their owners not because of any inherent violent nature PERIOD

By implementing breed restriction laws apartment complexes are profiling these specific breeds and doing nothing but continuing to raise these statistics PERIOD Its no different than discriminating against someone based on the color of their skin PERIOD

What gives us the right to put these specific breeds of dogs in a group just because other dogs of the same breed have shown signs of aggressive behavior
