After more than two years of no music Childish Gambino released his third studio album with Awaken My Love released Dec PERIOD   PERIOD
In this album Gambino continues to show his progression and growth as an artist PERIOD He strays away from rapping for almost the entire album primarily giving listeners a mix of psychedelic soul funk and RB sounds PERIOD
Gambino shows great control of his voice tone and range with strong consistent vocals PERIOD He uses a variety of tones that keeps the listener engaged from beginning to end PERIOD
Love is the main message in the album but Gambino still delivers diverse content as the subject of love allows him to cover many different topics PERIOD
In the track California he talks about his love for a woman and his determination to keep that love forever PERIOD In Have Some Fun Gambino urges the listener to escape all the hate and find a sense of togetherness PERIOD
Gambino has a song titled Baby Boy dedicated to his newborn child PERIOD It is a touching track in which he talks to his young son and tries to teach him important life lessons about relationships and the fleeting nature of life PERIOD
Gambino gives a lot of relatable content in the project PERIOD Whether a person is in a high point in their life or a low one they will find something to relate to PERIOD
This project is a huge risk for Gambino PERIOD As he explores new genres he may gain new fans but he could also lose his the rap fans that follow him PERIOD He doesnt have any traditional rap verses that his fans have grown accustomed to PERIOD
Songs like Bonfire and Sweatpants seem like a thing of the past for Gambino as this album is slowing the pace and aggressiveness down and shows more focus on instrumentation and R B type vocals PERIOD
Awaken My Love will have his fans split down the middle with some saying that this is his best project to date and others debating that it is his worst PERIOD Picking a side will be half the fun PERIOD
