A screenshot from Chace Lewis senior thesis PERIOD He and other seniors faced issues while presenting their work online PERIOD

As spring semester  began Eckerds campus buzzed with anticipation about what this year would bring as we welcomed the roaring 20s back into the world PERIOD COVID19 took that feeling away in March PERIOD

Each email update was like a punch to the gut PERIOD None of us could have imagined ourselves scrambling to pack our homes and move elsewhere just two months before graduation PERIOD It felt like packing up for Hurricane Irma two years ago except we all had a feeling we wouldnt come back PERIOD

As a senior preparing for my Thesis Photography Exhibition the biggest disappointment of this whole situation was finding out that our display would have to be virtual. rather than postponing our shows and having a physical gallery space to display our works we had to figure out how to use a new platform for a virtual exhibition PERIOD The most important art show of my college career was supposed to be in one of our brand new galleries but this situation forced me to present it digitally PERIOD

Working on a digital platform as a digital photographer it seemed like it would be business as usual PERIOD But once my Zoomhosted gallery talk began I quickly realized how anticlimactic it was PERIOD To see my work displayed on the very screen I spent hours a day on making these exact photographs was a very hollow feeling PERIOD The special thing about photography is the final physical product you get off the screen on a wall in a frame PERIOD

The format and distraction of COVID19 made some participating members of the senior thesis class and faculty to detach from rather than engage with these shows PERIOD

Apps like Zoom are designed to be as user friendly as possible yet some people including professors still had issues connecting PERIOD Some key faculty members neglected to even show up PERIOD Not only was this lack of engagement frustrating it was insulting PERIOD All of the senior visual art majors worked their hardest to make the thesis shows work as smoothly as possible and although Zoom meetings are not flawless most of the students in our class required to attend were able to make it work even some local artists who usually attend oncampus gallery talks were able to tune in PERIOD

Video meetings are not desirable for gallery talks because attendees are usually sitting in their bedrooms which takes away from their engagement and the ambiance of the show PERIOD I received almost no useful or constructive feedback PERIOD Professors and students alike had much less to say over the phone or computer and many of them remained muted throughout the critique session PERIOD

This pandemic caused us unprecedented stress but with Floridas hurricanes and extreme weather I think its likely art students will be forced to have digital thesis shows again PERIOD In that event I hope future students and professors can find the time and effort to fully support the art majors who put blood sweat and tears into their work for fellow artists to appreciate and provide feedback on PERIOD

Despite these few road bumps I would like to send a huge thank you to Professor of Visual Arts Arthur Skinner for caring and struggling alongside students to make our shows work the best we could PERIOD Students and especially art students are struggling to adapt right now but when professors match this effort it can mean the difference between a failed or successful exhibition PERIOD
