At a time when it is hard to find money to pay bills or even buy a girl roses people are looking for something inexpensive to do on weekends to keep up their spirits.What better way to do that than to organize a party and invite friends to share a potluck

Throwing a party in your home can seem like a daunting task PERIOD The responsibility of being a host can be a tedious sport of sprinting from end to end of ones property serving cocktails cooking lastminute treats cleaning up broken dishes and chasing down the house cat that someone carelessly let out PERIOD 
While there may not be a set of instructions to guarantee that everything goes right here are a few general tips to keep money in your wallet and have a good time PERIOD
A potluck if executed properly is an economical way to bring people together entertain them and stock up on leftovers for next week.Guests are responsible for bringing food for themselves as well as to share with others.Dont forget to assign folks to bring paper plates cups cutlery and ice PERIOD In theory a potluck alleviates the pocket of the host and ensures a variety of foods to keep the stomach happy while guests engage in whatever activities youve arranged for the evening.If youre feeling creative invite friends to bring traditional food from their home country PERIOD

One way to keep costs down while throwing a potluck party is to delegate responsibility PERIOD Part of the fun of a party is planning it and then enjoying the festivities PERIOD The planning stage can be a good opportunity to bond with a pal while relieving some of the burden of organizing everything PERIOD Pick one or two reliable friends to help PERIOD They can decorate the house with last years Christmas lights make calls off your guest list to assign what food or drinks to bring and most importantly stay with you once the partys done to help with the cleanup PERIOD Be sure to give credit to your party planners theyll appreciate you all the more for it PERIOD
Having a themed party is an easy way to get your guests committed to showing up by getting them to think about what to wear days before the event PERIOD A black and white wacky tacky or 60s hippie theme can add a new dimension to your bash PERIOD

Another important part of recession proof partying is to invite generously PERIOD The fact is no matter who you may be not everyone that you invite to your shindig will show up PERIOD It can be quite stressful and disappointing if at the end of the night your party is emptier than you wanted PERIOD Dont be afraid to invite a lot of people PERIOD If you explain to your guests clearly that they are responsible for bringing food and drinks the more people you invite the better PERIOD

Control the focus of your groups PERIOD Have activities prepared to keep guests entertained PERIOD Uno Apples to Apples a very fun game Pictionary or a party game for the Nintendo Wii are all fun ways to keep people having a good time PERIOD No party game is too silly among friends PERIOD Even if your guests spend all night in the hot tub or dancing to whatever music youre playing its good to have ideas and be prepared for a sudden shift in mood among your guests PERIOD

There is deep satisfaction to be had in bringing people together watching them bond and laugh whether they knew each other beforehand PERIOD Be brave and give it a shot PERIOD Youll be surprised how things have a way of working out PERIOD
