8767,2023-10-05,"earlier this year Governor Tina Kotek formed the Portland Central City Task Force PCCTF PERIOD PCCTF is charged with forming a plan to improve the city and address issues such as houselessness crime and druguse PERIOD The task force includes city leaders such as Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler business owners and other community leaders PERIOD

This roster is missing one important grouppeople who actually live and work downtown PERIOD

According to Street Roots PCCTF is a publicprivate partnership with the Oregon Business Councila 501c6 organization for groups with common business interests PERIOD Many of the task forces members are business owners along with some elected officials such as Wheeler and Rep PERIOD Earl Blumenauer PERIOD

Even though PCCTF includes elected officials the group will officially provide its recommendations to the Oregon Business Council exempting the task force meetings from public records disclosure PERIOD The meetings are closed to the public and the media and records of these meetings are entirely confidential PERIOD

In August Portland State President Ann Cudd announced how she would be joining the task force PERIOD As the citys research university Portland State is a hub of innovation and an engine for economic advancement Cudd stated in a press release PERIOD We are also a longstanding and committed partner to the city and I am ready to get to work along with other city leaders to turn Portlands ship in a new direction. the release noted how PSU is the largest landowner in downtown Portland stating that the university is an economic development engine PERIOD

There are some concerning aspects to note here PERIOD While PCCTF does have some government officials as members it is predominantly composed of individuals from the business sector PERIOD Many of its membersincluding its cochairare business owners PERIOD Furthermore the task forces recommendations will be presented at the Oregon Business Plans Leadership Summit in December PERIOD

The issue areas PCCTF focuses on are skewed in a certain direction PERIOD According to KGW the task force is divided into five groups Central City Value Proposition Livable Neighborhoods Community Safety Housing and Homelessness and Taxes for Services PERIOD

These are undoubtedly important issues but this isnt the right group to address them PERIOD I find it challenging to place trust in the Oregon Business Council to effectively address community safety PERIOD What does a livable neighborhood look like to businesses such as The Standard or Legacy Health What does community safety mean to Wells Fargo

These are issues best addressed by the people of Portland but we have yet to have a say on PCCTF PERIOD These meetings should be open to the public considering the potential changes they might bring to our city PERIOD As PSU students Cudd represents us on the task force yet we have no idea what this representation entails PERIOD There is no reason this task force should operate in secrecy yet it does PERIOD

In the end there are two real outcomes for the task force PERIOD Either it makes no real difference at allproving to be a waste of time for everyone involvedor it will make a meaningful difference to the city in which case downtown revitalization will be carried out based on the interests of business owners and the Oregon Business Council PERIOD Neither of these are good options and Portland deserves better PERIOD

Instead of focusing on negative issues which business owners are most concerned about we ought to have an honest public debate about the direction we want our city to go PERIOD Our elected representatives are supposed to fulfill this responsibility PERIOD

If and when state and local governments form a similar task force for real legislative change I will watch in anticipation PERIOD Until then PCCTF appears to be another public relations stunt with no one in mind except business owners PERIOD
