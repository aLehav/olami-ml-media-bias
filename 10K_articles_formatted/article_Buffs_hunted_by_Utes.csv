5248,2015-02-08,"the Buffalo bench looks on as the final seconds tick away in their  loss to  Utah PERIOD Matt SisnerosCU Independent

The University of Colorado mens basketball teamwent into Saturday nights home matchup against the University of Utah with high hopes of a little revenge from their earlier lossin the season but the outcome was quite the opposite PERIOD The Buffs dropped their eleventh game this year in an ugly blowout  PERIOD

Youve got to give Utah some credit head coach Tad Boyle said PERIOD Those guys were really really good tonight PERIOD I told our team in the locker room thats what a top  team looks like and they played like it tonight and they took it to us every way. the shooting percentages say it all PERIOD For the game the Buffs could only shoot . percent from the field and only made one threepointer for an . game percentage PERIOD Utahs numbers were the complete opposite PERIOD They went . percent from the field and even better from behind the arc going . percent and hitting  total threes PERIOD

Perhaps the only bright side if any was the return of junior forward Josh Scott who missed the past month with back spasms PERIOD In his debut game back from the injury Scott scored  points and grabbed seven boards PERIOD

But freshman guard Dominique Collier was the one to lead them all PERIOD In the best performance of his young career Collier dropped  points and grabbed four rebounds PERIOD

This is just on us Collier said after the game PERIOD You got to just suck it up and play PERIOD And it all starts on defense PERIOD They executed and we didnt on defense and that was the key in our loss today. in the opening minutes of the game the Buffs struggled to get anything going on offense without senior guard Askia Booker who sat out with a hip injury he sustained in practice earlier in the week PERIOD Utah went up  before the Buffs managed to get on the board with a layup and one PERIOD

From there it only gotworse PERIOD The Utes went up  before the Buffs managed to cut intothe lead PERIOD Nine minutes into the game they could only shoot . percent from the field whereas Utah shot . percent PERIOD The Buffs then responded in kind outscoring Utah  over the next few minutes to bring it within six PERIOD

From there on Utah kept increasing their lead as the half wore on PERIOD By the time the buzzer sounded for the break the Buffs trailed  PERIOD

Their offense didnt help them one bit PERIOD Throughout the first  minutes of play Colorado only managed to shoot . percent from the field and did not hit one of their six threepoint attempts PERIOD Utah fared much better on their side of the ball going . percent from the field and an even  percent from the three point range PERIOD

CUdid manage to win the rebounding game but just barely PERIOD They grabbed  total boards over Utahs  PERIOD

The Buffalo woes continued early into the second half as the Utes dropped three more threepointers to increase their lead to   PERIOD That wasnt even the biggest deficit of the game PERIOD The home boys went down by as much as  points  off of a series of turnovers and empty possessions PERIOD

Although it didnt really get any better the Buffs did manage the cut the lead to a final score of  PERIOD With the loss the Buffs dropped to  on the alreadyimploding season PERIOD

I think its very surprising Scott said PERIOD I dont think any of us thought that was going to happen to us at home PERIOD Were very good at home and we didnt play well PERIOD Its embarrassing. the Buffs return to their home floor on Thursday Feb PERIOD  to take on the California Bears at  p.m PERIOD

The problem was Utah was a hell of a lot better than us in every facet rebounding offense defense passing said Boyle PERIOD They got  assists and ten turnovers and we got five assists nine turnovers PERIOD Not good enough. contact CU Independent SportsWriter Alissa Noe at alissa.noecolorado.edu PERIOD
