I havent attended class since day one and I dont know what to write let alone how to write PERIOD When is my midterm essay due

Its not a question of when but an issue of what. i acknowledge that writers block is a nasty beast PERIOD Perhaps your midterm essay is a blank page the cursor flashing like illegal fireworks over the  block of DP on a Friday night PERIOD Once you figure out what you want to write about some angle to your professors tired old prompt that sparks inspiration the essay will begin to write itself PERIOD

In order to defeat writers block you must change your perspective PERIOD Dont passively accept what those before you have delineated as an essay. what is an essay truly If you wish to awe your professor or lets be honest your overworked and underpaid TA you must innovate PERIOD Thesis No perform an interpretive dance phrase that embodies your theme PERIOD Body paragraphs Knit a capsule wardrobe of hair collected from the communal shower drains PERIOD Works cited page Staple a halfeaten chartreuse crayon to a  bill instead PERIOD Allowing your mind to wander opens up a world of possibilities PERIOD

However I dont endorse this approach if you dont have a comprehensive dental plan PERIOD Crayon is pretty hard to floss away  or so Ive heard PERIOD Instead try brainstorming or thinking your way through any and every potential idea in bullet points or by recording yourself talking PERIOD From there you can narrow down your ideas following the most interesting points to add relevant examples or details PERIOD If writing is getting you down try a texttospeech software PERIOD Just make sure to dictate your essay in private or your housemates might be sending in an inquiry about you next week PERIOD

Your essay is due tomorrow by the way PERIOD

How do I tell my roommate that they howl in their sleep every night at  a.m. when it comes to howling honesty is the best policy PERIOD For all you know you might be one conversation away from securing yourself the newest coolest werewolf best friend PERIOD Or at least a werewolf within a human body PERIOD

But first you need to determine that your roommate is actually the one howling or if you are the howler PERIOD If the former reveals itself to be true proceed PERIOD Keep in mind that while potentially disruptive sleep talkers are often unable to control their nightly howls PERIOD Ensure the conversation is goodnatured and supportive PERIOD

If your roommate has always been a howler it might be time to invest in some Loop Earplugs not sponsored to muffle the noise PERIOD Is there a compromise you can make Perhaps obtaining some soundproof material to wrap around their head before bed is a good investment PERIOD

On the other hand it might be worth checking in regarding their mental health particularly if their howls are a new development and particularly agitated PERIOD Journaling meditation acting out wolf behaviors and somatic grounding exercises are all potential ways of easing the transition to sleep PERIOD Offer your support and perhaps youll both realize youve found a true pack PERIOD AwOooooOOOo

How do I wake up on time for my  a.m PERIOD class

Dont PERIOD The early bird troupe was invented to support capitalism PERIOD

By waking up early you are simply giving them what they want PERIOD Think of the poor worms PERIOD

What is your goto Rec Cen workout routine

If you truly knew me dear reader you would know that I have never set foot in that Godforsaken place PERIOD However please grant me the following space to spin an elaborate exercise tale PERIOD

Like Gretel and her little bitch brother Hansel I leave a trail of protein powder through the dark woods the path behind the tennis courts else I need to make a quick escape from the loogiehocking gym bros doing lunges PERIOD In one hand I clutch an extra large gym towel PERIOD In the other a dinosaur sippy cup PERIOD I fold up my SpiderMan Razor scooter and side it across the front desk PERIOD Keep her running I wink as I stroll past the StairMasters and ellipticals PERIOD I christen the Rec Cen bathrooms to assert my dominance PERIOD My preworkout is donated to those lifting any less than  pounds they clearly need the help more than me PERIOD

Exercising is more about consistency than anything else PERIOD Workout routines and gyms work for some people and not for others PERIOD Walk to campus play frisbee around the seniors napping on the Chem Lawn or take an afterdinner stroll down to Sands Beach PERIOD Plan a new hike with your roommates every Sunday or every other week depending on how hungover you are PERIOD

Please email mangingdailynexus.com if you are a qualified pickler piccolo player interested in joining a Division  pickleball team PERIOD

AJ as a famous newspaper columnist and jackofalltrades extraordinaire how do you find worklife balance

Reader you flatter me PERIOD Please keep the compliments coming PERIOD

Even if you love every single club or organization that you are part of recognize that you are still expending energy PERIOD The most important thing thats helped me is realizing that I dont have to be productive every single second of the day PERIOD Give yourself space to simply do nothing to honor your emotional limits make mistakes eat a protein bar watch Psych or stare at the sky PERIOD Especially as midterms approach figure out a schedule that incorporates nutrition hygiene and quiet time PERIOD If youre cramming in the library take a walk outside to experience your first breath of fresh air all day PERIOD Even the busiest people can take a moment to create and appreciate stillness PERIOD
