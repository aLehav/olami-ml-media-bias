BridgeND  Wednesday January  

One of the most striking aspects of language is its ability to be interpreted in many different ways PERIOD A phrase could mean a million different things to a million different people and a simple change in tone word choice and syntax could change everything PERIOD

Language and politics are inseparable PERIOD Words are the modus operandi of all politicians and the impact of modern language on women in politics is something to be wary of PERIOD

There are  women holding elected office in the U.S PERIOD This number pales in comparison to the approximately . million women of all ages in the U.S PERIOD Women make up more than  of Americas population PERIOD Yet they only hold  of elected offices on the federal state and local levels  and this  is a recordbreaking high as more than ever before women are now engaging in political office PERIOD

A meager  is impressively low for a recordbreaking high. holding the right to vote for over a century and exceeding men in both quantity and quality of persons educated American women have all of the tools necessary for success in the political sphere PERIOD Yet the gendered language of constituents media and other politicians presents an almost impenetrable barrier to women running for elected office PERIOD

For decades men have benefited from stereotypes around gender in politics whichconsistently associate masculinity and effective leadership PERIOD

Meredith Conroy a political science professor at California State University San Bernardino engaged in a research study to examine the use of gendered language in presidential elections from  to  PERIOD Examining a random sample of  printedition news articles from New York Times and USA Today Conroy recorded all traits used to describe all presidential candidates and created what is in essence a traits database. relying on an existent understanding of gendered traits from psychology and political science traits within the database were labeled as masculine feminine or genderneutral PERIOD Masculine traits might include risktaker or fighter feminine traits could be compassionate or cautious and neutral traits were those like intelligent old or liar. among the articles examined  of the traits recorded as describing presidential candidates were categorized as neutral  as masculine and  as feminine PERIOD The most common masculine traits were aggressive and confident generally framed in a positive light PERIOD The most common feminine traits were weak and inconsistent generally used negatively PERIOD Delving further into the data Conroy found that among all feminine traits used to describe candidates only  carried a positive tone PERIOD Compare this to the overwhelming  of masculine traits used positively and it is no surprise that masculinity has become associated with effective political leadership PERIOD

Though this study was published in  the use  and potential harm  of gendered language is more relevant now than ever before PERIOD And its no longer as subtle as character traits PERIOD

Donald Trumps language during his presidency alone provides one of the clearest examples of the harm done to women in politics by use of gendered and frankly sexist language

At a news conference in April of  the former president claimed that his opponent Hillary Clinton has nothing else to offer beyond her womans card  and the beautiful thing is women dont even like her. following the  vice presidential debate Trump said that Kamala Harris is this monster that was onstage with Mike Pence  She was terrible PERIOD I dont think you could get worse PERIOD And totally unlikeable. speaking of Senator Elizabeth Warren Trump said Goofy Elizabeth Warren one of the least productive US senators has a nasty mouth. trump referred to former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi as Nervous Nancy on his public twitter account PERIOD

During an interview with Rolling Stone Trump berated Carly Fiorina his opponent in the Republican primary saying that she could never be president because of her appearance PERIOD He said Look at that face Would anyone vote for that  I mean shes a woman and Im not supposed to say bad things but really  come on. unfortunately the above quotes are only a small portion of the long list of abrasive comments Trump has made toward women in the political sphere PERIOD From degrading women for their appearance to calling them weak or unlikeable for exhibiting very normal human behaviors the former president made a sport of calling forth hostile sexism against women in politics PERIOD

Beyond direct attacks on women Trumps attempts to emasculate other male politicians by feminizing them further builds the metaphorical wall to women entering the political sphere PERIOD In an attempt to convince former Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the results of the  election Trump said Pence can either go down in history as a patriot  or he can go down in history as a pssy. trump directly contrasts being a patriot  a positive and almost essential trait for any nations leader  and being a woman PERIOD By evoking female genitalia in a clearly negative connotation the former president promoted the historical tie between masculinity and political leadership PERIOD

If the executive leader of one of the most powerful nations in the world told you time and time again that you were not suited for politics because of your gender or sex would you not eventually start to believe him

The heavily gendered language we hear used regularly to describe suitability for the office of the president compounded with the traditional belief that masculine traits are necessary for executive leadership fortifies the idea that femininity and feminine qualities are illsuited for leadership PERIOD In consequence the improper idea that women are not capable of effective political leadership becomes more and more deeply ingrained in the American psyche PERIOD

From their youth women are taught through history experiential learning and the language of our culture that politics is a mans world with no room for women PERIOD We are incredibly lucky to be seeing so many women run for political office right now  especially given the culture of toxic masculinity which has washed over the American political sphere PERIOD

We need to elect the most qualified candidates to office regardless of their gender PERIOD However the current pool of candidates is limited by the use of gendered language as many highly qualified women are discouraged from even considering candidacy PERIOD

We cannot allow gendered language to continue socializing the notion that women dont have a place in politics PERIOD We cannot allow gendered language to continue excluding more than half of the American population from politics PERIOD And in a time of such volatility  where change is not only necessary but also decidedly happening  we certainly cannot allow gendered language to waste our opportunity to put more women in office PERIOD

Such minor things as what we say can impact such major effects as who leads the free world PERIOD Choose your words wisely PERIOD
