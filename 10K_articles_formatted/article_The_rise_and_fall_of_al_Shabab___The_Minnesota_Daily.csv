5031,2023-11-04,"minneapolis played a role in the decline of an international terrorist group PERIOD

by  Nasser MussaPublished  October  

From remote villages in Somalia to the U.S PERIOD Federal Court in Minneapolis alShabab has garnered attention throughout the world as a terrorist group from the Horn of Africa PERIOD

AlShabab seized power in the summer of  after driving warlords out of Mogadishu the capital city of Somalia which has remained a warzone despite efforts to form a stable government PERIOD Following its victory the group organized itself as an Islamist government following strict Sharia law PERIOD Within a few months alShabab mobilized a considerable number of fighters including American citizens who travelled to Somalia and joined the group to fight PERIOD

As alShabab fighters advanced in Somalia the U.S PERIOD government was concerned that Somalia would become a haven for terrorist groups and began aiding the Ethiopian government via financial support and military training PERIOD In winter  the Ethiopian troops invaded Somalia with U.S PERIOD support PERIOD

However this effort failed due to historical animosities between Somalia and Ethiopia PERIOD The Ethiopian invasion became a showdown for alShabab which gave the group popular support among Somali populations to fight against Ethiopian troops PERIOD I remember Somalis protesting in Minneapolis calling on Ethiopian troops to withdraw from Somalia PERIOD It was during this time that Americans began traveling to Somalia to join alShabab in  PERIOD

Following these departures Minneapolis was the site of an FBI investigation PERIOD According to the U.S PERIOD Justice Department federal agents have been conducting a longrunning international investigation into a pipeline that supplies men from Minneapolis to Somalia. the federal government indicted several individuals and convicted Mahamud Said Omar in the first case related to alShabab PERIOD Recently the group was widely driven out of its Somali strongholds PERIOD Though the group continues to train new members in south Somalia alShabab fortunately appears to be on a decline of public support and under intense pressure from the U.S PERIOD and African governments PERIOD
