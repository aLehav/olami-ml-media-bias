Nootersaid she was inspired to create Poetry and the Human two years ago PERIOD There was a moment when I looked at the list of classes and tried to imagine what I would have wanted to take as an 18yearoldNootersaid PERIOD I was looking for a class which spoke to me and I didnt see it. according to the preliminary syllabus Poetry and the Human will include the works of Sappho Homer Catullus Hafez Ki noTsurayuki John Donne LouisZukofsky DahliaRavikovitch Anne Carson N PERIOD ScottMomadayandClaudia Rankineas well aspoems from Chinas Tang period PERIOD

During the first three years of any new Hum sequence only junior and senior professors are permitted to instruct the course PERIOD According toNooterimplementing new material ofteninvolves unforeseen challenges.Older Core Humanities sequences are also taught by HarperSchmidt Fellows and graduate students PERIOD

According to the syllabus Poetry and the Human will investigate the role of poetry in society in regard to memory storytelling andhistory ritual and magicknowledge and formation of selfhoodand institution and revolution PERIOD

Poetry is notan apolitical removed eventand its especially important nowNootersaid PERIOD

The third quarter creative writing Art Core option coincides with the new creative writing major which willbe offered starting in the  academic year.Nootersaid the sequence was notdevised with this explicitly in mind but that she would love to have studentswith nocreative writing experiencefeel confident enough to experiment withclasses in the new major PERIOD

Nootersaid that even if students do not take further creative writing or poetry courses at the University she hopes students develop and refine skills in this course that they can later apply to other academic realms PERIOD

I would want students finishing the Poetry and the Human course to read and notice things in precise and pointed ways because that is how the best scholarship startsNootersaid PERIOD
