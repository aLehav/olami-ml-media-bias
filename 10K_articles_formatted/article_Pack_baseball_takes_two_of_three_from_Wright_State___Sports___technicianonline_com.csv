Sophomore center fielder Josh McLain crushes a pitch from a Wright State pitcher during the Wolfpacks  loss Feb PERIOD  PERIOD McLain recorded one run one hit including a double and one RBI in the loss at Doak Field PERIOD

After losing the first game of a tight series and playing an underrated opponent the NC State baseball team rallied to win the final two games of its series against Wright State PERIOD Good outings from starting pitching and continued offensive success allowed the Pack to turn the tide in the series PERIOD

The weekend started badly for the Wolfpack  as the Raiders  used their talented roster to propel themselves to a  win Friday PERIOD Save for a fourrun second inning senior righthander Jesse Scholtens shut down the Wolfpack hitters for most of the night and junior Wolfpack starter Ryan Williamson could not match him posting a poor outing four innings six hits four runs PERIOD

Wright State was probably a scheduling mistake on my part head coach Elliott Avent said PERIOD I believe in a tough schedule PERIOD If you can survive it then it makes you better in the end PERIOD Surviving it is going to be the key now. five games into the season the Wolfpack was desperate for a strong performance on the mound after receiving only one outing that lasted past the fifth inning PERIOD The Pack gave the ball to ace sophomore Brian Brown on Saturday and got exactly what it needed from the lefty PERIOD

While Brown pitched only five innings he allowed only three hits and one unearned run en route to his first win of the season PERIOD The deciding inning in the second game of the series was the sixth where a huge relief performance by sophomore lefty Cody Beckman saved the Pack and allowed the bats to create separation from the Raiders PERIOD

After a walk and two errors by Brown Beckman was called in to a baseloaded noout jam with the Pack leading  in the sixth inning PERIOD Unfazed Beckman struck out sophomore first baseman Gabe Snyder for the first out of the inning PERIOD The very next batter Beckman induced an inningending double play to avoid disaster and ensure the Wolfpack escaped the inning unscathed PERIOD

The Wolfpack broke the game wide open in the bottom of the frame as sophomores Evan Mendoza and Brock Deatherage each drove in runs before Josh McLain ripped a tworun double down the left field line to give the Pack a  lead PERIOD

You come back in the bottom of the inning and thats where we got the runs Avent said on Saturday night PERIOD Thats where we won. beckman would finish with   innings not allowing a hit or run to the Raiders batters PERIOD

Sunday brought a rubber match between the two teams with the Wolfpack turning to sophomore Joe ODonnell to try and win the series PERIOD

The Raiders placed runners in scoring position in each of the first three innings including a basesloaded noout threat in the first inning PERIOD ODonnell would bend but not break allowing just one run in the top of the first and giving the Wolfpack bats time to work PERIOD

After tying the game in the bottom of the first senior designated hitter Chance Shepard broke the game open in the third with a threerun home run to left field to put the Pack up  PERIOD The Pack never looked back continuing to tack on runs for an  win in the finale PERIOD

Sunday is a crucial day and overall a great team win junior catcher Andrew Knizner said PERIOD They are a very good ball club PERIOD Very solid team. the Wolfpack earned two wins against a tough opponent this weekend and looked like a top10 team as the pitching and hitting posted good performances together for the first time this season PERIOD The Wolfpack will take on UNCGreensboro and UNCWilmington in games this week PERIOD
