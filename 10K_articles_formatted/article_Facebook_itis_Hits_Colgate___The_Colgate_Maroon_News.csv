Email AIM cell phones old CUTV programs the Inky the list of distractions for Colgate students is endless as we all find incredible  and often ridiculous  ways to put off our work PERIOD And just when you thought you had conquered that desire to check your away message or see if any new emails have arrived the phenomenon that has slowly been invading campuses nationwide reaches Colgate in the last year PERIOD Procrastination just requested a new friend and TheFacebook.com accepted PERIOD This all may sound a bit dramatic especially to those who have yet to discover TheFacebook.com but to rest of us its an obsession that has me questioning two things PERIOD First is this a perpetuation of superficiality or merely a fun distraction that allows us to see our friends and their friends and their friends friends Secondly is this a new means of communication that is beneficial to our society or just another step in the total deterioration of physical contact i.e PERIOD phone calls and letters In response to the first dilemma I do not think TheFacebook.com is merely a perpetuation of superficiality mainly because the people we are seeing are already our friends PERIOD It differs from the Inky in the respect that we are no longer judging these people merely on appearance because we know them PERIOD And if we dont know them we can take away at least a small sense of their personality from either their profile or the type of picture they choose to display PERIOD While of course TheFacebook.com feeds our superficiality to some extent  for example in instances where one might vainly try and gain as many friends as possible just for the number  for the most part I can take it all in good fun PERIOD The second question is more complex but despite the fun of TheFacebook.com and the occasional use it has in connecting old pals it is basically just another example of our societys laziness PERIOD With TheFacebook.com we are given reminders of our friends birthdays we are given their screen names their email addresses their room numbers and more PERIOD Now we dont even have to IM them for this basic information let alone call or even write PERIOD While we are provided with a friendly picture and personal profile what truly reminds us of a friend is lost PERIOD Its impossible not to give in to the technology that surrounds us in one way or another especially with something that feeds our natural curiosities so well as TheFacebook.com PERIOD So with this being said I know Ill still frequent the website and probably will continue to check it as regularly as email or AIM as Im sure the rest of you will PERIOD But just keep this quote by economist Thomas Sowell in mind The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people PERIOD It often means the opposite. lectures
