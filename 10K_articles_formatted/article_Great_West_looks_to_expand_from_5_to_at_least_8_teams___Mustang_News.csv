The Great West Football Conference is looking into expanding to at least eight teams in order to secure an automatic bid to the Division IAA playoffs the Mustang Daily has learned PERIOD

In a phone interview Tuesday Great West commissioner Ed Grom declined to name what schools the Great West has contacted about joining the footballonly conference in which Cal Poly is currently one of five IAA teams PERIOD He said however that discussions are already underway and that an announcement on expansion could be made as early as January PERIOD

Weve had discussions with several schools some out west Grom said PERIOD We need to expand in order to gain an NCAA automatic qualifier PERIOD Were pursuing a seventh and eighth member to solidify that. in the midst of its third season the Great West will not provide an automatic berth to the 16team IAA postseason until it consists of six playoffeligible teams aligned for at least two seasons PERIOD It currently consists of Cal Poly UC Davis Southern Utah North Dakota State and South Dakota State PERIOD

Grom whose office is located in Elmhurst Ill. is also the commissioner of the nonfootball MidContinent Conference PERIOD He said the Great West has not limited its goal to eight teams PERIOD

Eight perhaps more if the right mix of schools comes together Grom said PERIOD Were discussing an announcement as early as January with a couple possible members PERIOD Well see how those talks go. despite the goal of expansion Grom confirmed an Oct PERIOD  report in the Sioux Falls S.D. argus Leader newspaper that the Gateway Football Conference has requested information from both North Dakota State and South Dakota State PERIOD The Gateway has admitted interest in adding the two schools because it is losing Western Kentucky whose board of regents voted  Nov PERIOD  to move to the IA level PERIOD That would leave the Gateway in its twenty-second season with only seven teams PERIOD

Were quite aware that the Gateway has approached both North and South Dakota State Grom said PERIOD All theyve done is ask for information from those schools PERIOD As of now theyre Great West members in good standing. asked whether he is worried if North Dakota State and South Dakota State might leave the Great West Grom said I dont think we can worry at this time. though Grom would not specify what schools the Great West has contacted one possibility is the University of San Diego a private school that fits well in the nonfootball West Coast Conference but is an unusual component of the Pioneer Football League PERIOD In its fourteenth year the Pioneer consists of San Diego Drake Davidson Jacksonville Butler Morehead State Dayton and Valparaiso PERIOD

San Diego however would have to become a program with scholarships to join the Great West PERIOD San Diego head coach Jim Harbaugh has said in the past that he would like the 15thranked Toreros  to gain scholarships PERIOD

A phone message left Tuesday for San Diego executive director of athletics Ky Snyder was not returned PERIOD

Aside from Cal Poly UC Davis and San Diego the only other IAA football program in California is Sacramento State which is currently one of nine teams in the mighty Big Sky Conference PERIOD

Grom said he could not name the schools the Great West has contacted because they are in good standing with their respective leagues PERIOD

Were doing what we can to expand the league and make it viable Grom said PERIOD

Despite not providing an automatic bid to the IAA playoffs the Great West is ranked No PERIOD  among  IAA conferences in USA Todays Jeff Sagarin ratings PERIOD

That actually places it ahead of the IA Sun Belt Conference which includes Middle Tennessee State  Arkansas State  Troy  and LouisianaLafayette  PERIOD

Were really pleased about the performance of all our Great West institutions Grom said PERIOD We knew going into the season that all five schools were going to be competitive teams PERIOD Im really pleased with the IA wins PERIOD South Dakota State had a very tough start really picked it up by winning six straight games PERIOD I think the league has been pretty balanced. the Great Wests wins over IA schools Grom referred to are North Dakota States  win at Ball State  on Sept PERIOD  and Cal Polys  win at San Diego State  on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD North Dakota State lost  at IA Minnesota  on Oct PERIOD  and Cal Poly lost  at IA San Jose State  on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Entering the weekend the Great West has three teams ranked in The Sports Networks IAA poll  No PERIOD  North Dakota State   No PERIOD  Cal Poly   and No PERIOD  South Dakota State   PERIOD UC Davis   and Southern Utah   round out the Great West PERIOD

Every team in the league can play Cal Poly head coach Rich Ellerson said Oct PERIOD  PERIOD Thats really an impressive crowd PERIOD Weve gotten peoples attention and we deserve to have peoples attention based on the way the teams in the conference have played. the top four teams in the Great West are all in the top  of IAA.orgs Gridiron Power Index which simulates the NCAA playoff selection committees formula used to determine which teams reach the postseason PERIOD

Despite the lofty rankings North Dakota State South Dakota State and UC Davis are all barred from postseason play this year because each school is a provisional IAA member still transitioning from Division II PERIOD

When asked how the Great West became the topranked conference in only its third year Grom credited the commitment each school has put forth PERIOD

The commitment they put into their programs led to this he said PERIOD They committed to their scholarships and recruited the right types of players. the Great West has been the topranked IAA conference for four weeks PERIOD It ended last season No PERIOD  in that category PERIOD

Cal Poly likely must win its final two games of the season  at North Dakota State on Saturday and at home against Savannah State  on Nov PERIOD   to reach the playoffs PERIOD

Were anxious to see how Cal Poly ends the season obviously Grom said PERIOD I think if you do see a win from Cal Poly this weekend I would hope the selection committee would grant them a bid. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
