As a blackandwhite thought playing on television is great and the head coach agrees PERIOD

The upside would be that theres exposure to be had playing on TV said Penn State womens volleyball coach Russ Rose PERIOD

And broadcasting volleyball certainly does have its positives hometown friends separated from their hometown heroes can tune in expert analysts dissect aspects of every athletes game and the hosting stadiums atmosphere is even more electric than usual PERIOD

However the drawbacks to playing on television go largely unnoticed to someone outside the program PERIOD

Two weeks ago after playing a rare Wednesday match at Iowa  one of the No PERIOD  Nittany Lions furthest Big Ten opponents  the Lions were not back in Happy Valley until  a.m PERIOD Thursday morning according to Rose PERIOD

Then after being back in State College for a few breaths of air the team was back on the road for a Sunday afternoon match at Nebraska  another lengthy trip PERIOD

Already fatigued according to Rose the Lions let a win slip away in five sets suffering their second loss of the season this one to the Cornhuskers PERIOD

To tack on more pain the Lions did not return home until about  p.m PERIOD that night PERIOD

The downside is the travel scenario that takes place is incredibly not student friendly Rose said PERIOD

Rose said the reason in large part for these scheduling woes is Penn States ability to draw large audiences when televised as somewhat on a game of the week on Big Ten Network PERIOD

It impacts the quality of their life their rest time all of the things that I would say are important Rose said PERIOD But with change one has to change. rose reflected on  years ago when he was a fresh hire for the head coaching job at Penn State PERIOD He said rather than worrying about television he would lay floor tape and set up the net before a match PERIOD

While times have changed so have the players who now come into programs with the expectation of playing on television PERIOD

Players collective excitement about being televised seems to wane the further players get into their careers PERIOD

Veteran rightside hitter Ariel Scott was not moved whatsoever when asked if playing this past weekend on ESPN2 added any extra excitement PERIOD

Not really PERIOD Its just nice to play at home said Scott who garnered plenty of airtime during Penn States national championship season in  PERIOD

Meanwhile younger players like freshman Megan Courtney and sophomore Nia Grant are visibly more excited when talking about the benefits of playing on television PERIOD

Personally I love playing on TV but it doesnt feel any different between playing on TV or not Grant said PERIOD

Grant added that she chose to attend Penn State based on its pedigree rather than the exposure of playing in front of a virtual audience PERIOD

Rose cosigns Grants statement saying Penn States biggest recruiting advantage is simply being Penn State PERIOD

I think when we were on TV during the  finals every year that had a far greater impact on recruiting Rose said PERIOD Not because it was national television  but because we were playing for the national championship and kids dream about competing for a national championship PERIOD

Courtney echoed Grants love playing on TV statements but focused more on the aforementioned negatives like her coach PERIOD

You have to work around the TV schedule rather than your own schedule Courtney said PERIOD Its hard but its part of the game. that is essentially the message Rose stands by except with a tiny modification who suggests the scheduling dilemma does not have to be part of the game PERIOD

The BTN has done a lot of great things for the conference and the schools involved Rose said PERIOD But I certainly think that they could take a look at some things. he suggested the involved organizations quit saying the network exposure is for the kids when he said he has a hardtime thinking thats taking student welfare as a priority. to email reporter myb5162psu.edu
