Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



While other designs have come and gone at present there are two types of charger connections that account for the majority of EV chargers in use PERIOD Automoblog explains the differences and whats happening in the industry PERIOD

As electric vehicles EVs take up more and more of the overall automotive market share the need for a robust and reliable EV charging network continues to grow PERIOD But since the widespread adoption of EVs is a relatively recent phenomenon the U.S PERIOD has yet to adopt a universal standard for the type of connectors used to charge the vehicles PERIOD

That appeared to be changing as more automakers moved towards the Combined Charging System CCS in recent years PERIOD However auto giants Ford and General Motors recently announced that they would be designing their EVs to use the North American Charging Standard NACS system created by Tesla PERIOD This announcement launched an EV charging standard war that could have major implications for the EV industry PERIOD



The technology and design of EV chargers have evolved since the vehicles first entered the mainstream PERIOD One of the earliest plug designs to be broadly adopted was the J1772 first produced in  PERIOD The J1772 plugs have been commonly called  but are more accurately described as EV power supplies since they do not charge an EV battery directly PERIOD Because they only conduct AC power they supply power to the vehicles onboard charger which then converts that power to DC to charge the battery itself PERIOD

While other designs have come and gone at present there are two types of charger connections that account for the majority of EV chargers in use PERIOD Automoblog explains the differences and whats happening in the industry PERIOD



The CCS charging system was built off of the J1772 plug it took the original plug design and added a DC plug PERIOD This enhanced design allows the charger to bypass the power supply and use DC electricity to charge the battery directly PERIOD The result is a much faster charge that also eliminates the need for two charging ports cables and plugs PERIOD

Until recently it appeared as if CCS had  the earlier iteration of the charging standard war PERIOD

In February the Biden administration announced a series of regulations and incentives designed to bolster the EV industry called the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law BIL PERIOD Among the facets of the law is a . billion fund earmarked for EV charging development PERIOD

The administration outlined several requirements for companies to access those funds PERIOD Like with programs in the Inflation Reduction Act eligibility hinges on at least  of EV charger components being produced domestically by June  PERIOD But the regulations also stipulate that charging stations must incorporate CCS technology PERIOD This portion of the BIL appeared to cement CCS as the de facto EV charging standard for the U.S PERIOD



As CCS appeared to be on its way to becoming the dominant charger design Tesla continued to develop its own charging technology PERIOD First referred to as the Tesla Supercharger the company renamed the system to the North American Charging Standard NACS in November  PERIOD

Critics have argued that the NACS chargers have several advantages over CCS chargers including faster charging and more reliable performance PERIOD The NACS chargers have a smaller more ergonomic design and are capable of more than  amps  compared to the  that CCS chargers are capable of PERIOD

Still the announcement of the BIL looked like it could deal a fatal or at least devastating blow to the NACS system PERIOD However when Tesla announced the name change it also announced that it would share the technology with other automakers to encourage them to adopt it PERIOD



The decision to share the design for the NACS system may have saved it PERIOD Roughly seven months after the announcement the NACS picked up some powerful supporters in Ford and General Motors PERIOD

In June the American automotive giants announced that they would be integrating NACS technology into their EV lineups by  PERIOD The shift away from CCS and to NACS is a significant development PERIOD As of  Ford and GM combined to make up  of the EV market share according to data from Bank of America Global Research BofAGR PERIOD

That same data estimates that the two automakers will account for a total of  of the market holding  each by  PERIOD Combined with the  market share that BofAGR estimates Tesla will own an estimated  of new EVs will use NACS technology by   just from those three automakers alone PERIOD

Other companies such as Rivian and Volvo have also announced a shift towards NACS PERIOD Volkswagen Stellantis and Hyundai have all said that they were in talks with Tesla PERIOD



While Ford and GM jumping on board is a huge win for Tesla as a company it may end up causing problems for Tesla owners at least in the short term PERIOD Until recently NACS chargers were exclusive to Tesla vehicles meaning Tesla owners have had the entire network to themselves PERIOD

But once the deluge of new EVs from Ford GM and others equipped with NACS ports hit the road the current infrastructure may not be enough to support it PERIOD In fact many industry experts speculate that the EV charging infrastructure as a whole may not be able to support the increasing amounts of electric vehicles on the road in the near future PERIOD

Much of the manufacturing and development of EV charging stations has been built around CCS as the standardtobe and Tesla only recently released the NACS technology to the industry atlarge PERIOD Because of such a relatively sudden shift it may take time for NACS infrastructure to meet the influx in demand PERIOD



While some have taken to comparing the charging standard rivalry to the VHS versus Betamax format war of the 1980s a more apt comparison might be Apples Lightning system versus the USBC charging system used by Android phones PERIOD In the video format war VHS emerged as the clear winner and Betamax effectively disappeared from the market PERIOD But there is a chance that CCS and NACS could coexist PERIOD

In  Tesla announced that the company would be adding CCS chargers to its charging stations PERIOD This was even before subsidies for incorporating CCS technology as part of the BIL were announced PERIOD With billions of dollars in funding up for grabs adding CCS plugs to Tesla charging stations alongside NACS chargers could make the company eligible to receive some of those funds PERIOD

Even if NACS ends up claiming most of the market share in the U.S. CCS is firmly established as the standard in the European Union PERIOD European car manufacturers especially may be reluctant to take on the added expense of producing two versions of the same car to accommodate both the E.U PERIOD and North American markets PERIOD Should they decide to hold out there will still be substantial demand for CCS chargers PERIOD



The rise of the EV industry has allowed for the birth and growth of an EV charging infrastructure industry alongside it PERIOD According to a report from Research and Markets the EV charging industry was valued at . billion in  PERIOD The report predicts that this market will grow to be worth . billion by  PERIOD

However the EV charging standard war has the potential to disrupt this industry in the short term PERIOD Just a few months ago companies could have comfortably formed plans to manufacture CCSbased charging stations for the U.S PERIOD market based on the industrys trajectory at the time PERIOD But with such a substantial shift underway  and the potential for even more movement in the near future  manufacturers will need to adjust PERIOD

There is a great deal of public money at stake too PERIOD In addition to the . billion the BIL makes available for charging station production the U.S PERIOD Department of Transportation DOT National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure NEVI program provides funding to state and local governments to build out their EV charging infrastructure PERIOD That means manufacturers could effectively receive state and local funding through purchases on top of subsidies provided by the federal government PERIOD As of yet however companies could be uncertain of what kind of chargers to produce PERIOD With a financial windfall in the balance some may hesitate to move forward on one or the other PERIOD

Current and potential owners of EVs could also be affected by this battle over charging standards if one of the two systems emerges as the clear winner PERIOD In this way the VHS versus Betamax comparison may fit a little better PERIOD People who bought Betamax players were eventually left with practically useless technology as VHS gained a monopoly on the home video market PERIOD Similarly if either CCS or NACS emerges as  charging station manufacturers will eventually have no incentive to continue supporting the other system PERIOD As a result owners of vehicles with those systems may be left with dwindling options to charge their EVs PERIOD

Right now there is no clear indication of which format  if either  will become the dominant charging system in this country PERIOD While CCS is still the system of choice for many automakers and carries the backing of the federal government and the funding it provides NACS currently appears to have all the momentum and the reputation among many as being the superior technology PERIOD

It took more than  years for VHS to be declared the winner over Betamax PERIOD The EV charging standard war may not last until  but it may be years before we see whether CCS or NACS comes out on top PERIOD
