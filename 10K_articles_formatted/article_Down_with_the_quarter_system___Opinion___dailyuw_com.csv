Updated November     pm



School has officially kicked off PERIOD There are now only ten weeks before the quarter is over and we are masterfully regurgitating all the knowledge weve learned all over our finals PERIOD At least that is how we hope it goes PERIOD But sometimes unexpected events happen and we fall behind and one rough week can put a decent dent in your hopes of success PERIOD

The semester system is preferable because it offers more weeks of instruction and is more forgiving when students slip up PERIOD It offers  weeks of instruction before you take the final and move onto other classes PERIOD Because of this there are more opportunities to catch up as well as more time to get comfortable with the material before you are tested PERIOD

The UW is in the minority of schools that use the quarter system PERIOD This does not necessarily mean the semester is inherently better PERIOD However I believe that the semester system caters to more peoples preferences and does not significantly disadvantage those who prefer the quarter system PERIOD

In the semester system there is more time to get to know each other principal lecturer in the UW department of physics Daryl Pedigo said PERIOD Students get more comfortable. the quarter system here can feel frantic stressful and rushed PERIOD I have had quarters where I felt perpetually behind not going a week without a test that would be worth a significant portion of my grade PERIOD Every quarter around week seven I feel myself burning out after midterms only to have final papers due and tests starting in less than three weeks PERIOD

The advantages of the quarter system revolve around the faster pace and being able to fit more classes into a year PERIOD The fast pace can combat procrastination and students are more likely to stay engaged since they often meet with their classes more frequently PERIOD Plus if you are stuck with a bad teacher you will spend less time with them PERIOD But these advantages do not really help those beyond the people who are doing school alone PERIOD

The main reason the semester system is better is because there is more time to become immersed in six classes during one year rather than rushing through nine PERIOD Having more time would mean better relationships with professors and more immersion in the classes you are taking PERIOD

When the primary concern is for educating the greatest amount of students and not weeding people away from highly competitive majors there is more of an argument for semesters PERIOD It would mean that there would be more emphasis placed on having professors who want to teach standing in front of students PERIOD It would also mean that students who may have unexpected events pop up would have more understanding professors and would have more time to correct their course before finals come around PERIOD

The quarter system has its value to some PERIOD But the semester would be better for all PERIOD
