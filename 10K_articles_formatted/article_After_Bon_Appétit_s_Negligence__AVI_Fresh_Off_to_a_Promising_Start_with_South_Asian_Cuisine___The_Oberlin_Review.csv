AVI Fresh has opened a variety of new dining locations including Umami at Fairchild which specializes in East Asian food PERIOD

After a year of college life in the U.S. making do with Bon Apptits occasional and mortifying excuse for Indian food it was a breath of fresh air to walk into Stevie and find a genuinely tasty preparation of cauliflower and potatoes with a side of chickpea curry gobhi aloo ki sabzi and chole PERIOD AVI Fresh has swooped in to redeem my impression of college dining options PERIOD

The problem with Bon Apptit was never simply the lack of good Indian food. i do understand that the manner in which food is prepared is influenced by who prepares it and for whom it is cooked and I have tried to be open to different possibilities and preferences to that end PERIOD Yet there is a difference between making bad food and purposefully misrepresenting the culture of the food in question PERIOD Food represents comfort and family and is a symbol in itself of community history and tradition PERIOD

Bon Apptit was not simply unable to properly represent various cultures foods they were actively negligent PERIOD A few years ago students from the South Asian Students Association shared recipes with Stevie staff and there ensued a twoweek period when Stevie served enjoyable Indian food that these students could proudly recommend to others PERIOD Bon Apptits shortlived success stands testament to the fact that they were capable of preparing quality food but chose to use recipes to the exact opposite effect PERIOD

Evidence of Bon Apptits poor choice of recipes presented itself last year when the dining hall put mirin a slightly sweet Japanese rice wine in butter chicken  a dish that was invented in the late 1940s in New Delhi PERIOD Each type of Asian cuisine is distinct from others a reality that is a natural consequence of the readily available spices and resources in a geographical space PERIOD To use a spice designed for a specific flavor profile indigenous to a particular part of Asia as an ingredient in a dish with an entirely different traditional value  and to call it Butter Chicken  is a generalization of Asian identity and tantamount to cultural appropriation and erasure PERIOD

This isnt a question of adjusting how spicy a dish is to better cater to American palettes which is understandable PERIOD Rather this is a situation where the composition of the dish itself is wildly different to the point where it can no longer be considered the same dish PERIOD Preparing food that is unrecognizable to the cultures it belongs to is a form of appropriation  referring to the food as Indian when it is little more than a purposefully ignorant mimicry of Indian food is a deliberate misrepresentation of reality PERIOD

This isnt a new or even relatively recent conversation in Oberlin PERIOD A  Review article by Clover Linh Tran titled CDS Appropriates Asian Dishes Students Say lists a series of incidents of cultural appropriation on Bon Apptits part PERIOD

Students felt that Bon Apptit the food service management company contracted by Oberlin College has a history of blurring the line between culinary diversity and cultural appropriation by modifying the recipes without respect for certain Asian countries cuisines Tran wrote in the article PERIOD This uninformed representation of cultural dishes has been noted by a multitude of students many of whom have expressed concern over the gross manipulation of traditional recipes. the article made valid points and clearly the concerns expressed by Tran still exist on campus PERIOD National media outlets caught wind of the article at the time and spun the piece as a testament to the excesses of Oberlinstudent activism. a  article in the Chronicle of Higher Education by Vimal Patel titled Colleges Are Losing Control of Their Story PERIOD The BanhMi Affair at Oberlin Shows How discusses how this incident was used to illustrate the privilege that liberal arts students enjoy but that critics ignored the issue of respectful representation PERIOD The fact is that cultural appropriation is a form of racial discrimination and now more than ever we cannot ignore the harm that causes PERIOD

Any American catering service choosing to serve international foods must be aware of the power they have in controlling a cultural narrative particularly for audiences who have limited access or exposure to international foods PERIOD While international students are naturally aware of how food represents elements of their tradition  from historic relevance to cultural symbolism  the same isnt necessarily true for domestic students and labelling food in a particular manner assumes control over how they may perceive a culture PERIOD As a result students are at risk of forming generalizations and misplaced biases against a culture that is already disadvantaged PERIOD

Not only does a dining services vendor have a responsibility to serve quality food that is respectful of the cultures and identities of a diverse student body but as an academic institution dining is also intrinsically involved in our everyday learning PERIOD The processes of appropriation purposeful misrepresentation and erasure certainly do not befit a fair and accurate learning space PERIOD AVI Fresh must now navigate a space already marred by a history of bad experiences and actively avoid these pitfalls as it establishes itself in Oberlin PERIOD

Thus far AVI Fresh is actively making an effort to produce culturally diverse foods that actually taste good PERIOD And while I cannot speak to the authenticity of the dishes served at Umami Clarity and DeCaf I can say I have thoroughly enjoyed the food I have eaten and am excited by their Indian options as well PERIOD Yet a good start does not ensure longterm success and AVI needs to be consistent in its quality if it intends to continue its multicultural dining options PERIOD This isnt just about my dining experience anymore PERIOD This is about my culture traditions and how people view the world I come from PERIOD
