Letter to the Editor  Monday October  

Most of us are probably familiar with the running TV segment aired during Notre Dame football games highlighting the pioneering achievements of our student body faculty and alumni PERIOD Right now I call Notre Dame to harness its collective energy and resources to rally around advocating for a lasting peaceful solution to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict PERIOD

Two months ago I traveled to Jerusalem and the West Bank to visit various holy sites and witnessed firsthand IsraeliPalestinian relations PERIOD I had the opportunity to first visit the region as a Notre Dame student majoring in political science and Arabic in the summer of  and ever since Ive tried to get back to this region as much as possible PERIOD

My most recent return was jarring to say the least PERIOD I visited the cosmopolitan beaches of Tel Aviv the Palestinian refugee camps and stood at the wall dividing Bethlehem and Jerusalem where Pope Francis prayed for peace in  PERIOD Looking back I felt the underlying tensions that would eventually boil over to cause such a calamitous act of terror we are now seeing on TV PERIOD

I came away from my most recent trip with a distinct sense of purpose and a call to action  with the question What can I do to help running through my head PERIOD

I believe this response  the one I had to fight for change  is what Notre Dame wants all its graduates to go out into the world with after leaving the friendly confines of campus PERIOD To make a difference in the world PERIOD Its why we have the TV spotlight during football games right 

With my individual agency in this broader conflict the immediate answer I came up with was to return to campus meet with old faculty attend lectures and research what our various institutions on campus are doing to advance peace between Israel and Palestine PERIOD My solution was tapping back into the Notre Dame community to hopefully amplify the urgency and necessity to do more than we are presently doing PERIOD Based on my research I came away with a sense that we can and must do more as Americas preeminent Catholic university to advance lasting peace in the Holy Land PERIOD

Will Notre Dame tap into its global Rolodex of peace builders and lawmakers to advance a dialogue that breaks the decadeslong cycle of violence Will Notre Dame pivot and unleash the awesome transformative powers held by the brains at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies As members of the Notre Dame family we should all expect the answer to be an unequivocal and resounding yes PERIOD

Presently the narrative is and will be about arms shipments aircraft carriers stationed offseas retribution antisemitism Islamophobia and just a general dehumanization of innocents PERIOD Violence begets violence PERIOD

Grounded in our religious roots our global influence and our vast resources we have a responsibility to make change PERIOD Peace in the Holy Land is what Notre Dame should be fighting for PERIOD
