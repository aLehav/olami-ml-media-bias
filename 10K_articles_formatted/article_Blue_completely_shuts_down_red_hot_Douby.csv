NEW YORK  Michigan knew heading into last nights
NIT final that the key to beating Rutgers would be slowing down
redhot guard Quincy Douby PERIOD But nobody figured Michigan would
nearly stop him altogether PERIOD

Douby a freshman from Brooklyn had been on a tear since
entering Rutgerss starting lineup at the start of the NIT PERIOD
Douby scored  points since the start of the tournament including
 in the Scarlet Knights win over Iowa State in the
semifinals PERIOD

But Michigan held Douby to just two points for the game on
1for13 shooting behind a solid effort by Bernard Robinson and
great help defense in a number of situations PERIOD

A couple of times I had a pretty good look at the basket
and kind of rushed it Douby said PERIOD But Ive got
to give them credit PERIOD They did a really good job PERIOD They contested all
my shots. the Wolverines couldnt have done better against Douby in
the first half PERIOD Guarded primarily by Robinson the Rutgers freshman
was shut down completely  missing all eight of his shots in
the first frame PERIOD

Even when Robinson wasnt guarding Douby the Wolverines
prevented the freshman from getting any good looks at the basket by
switching off on screens PERIOD

We had a good defensive team effort Michigan
coach Tommy Amaker said PERIOD You cant have one player
think that theyre gonna stop one other guy PERIOD It takes a group
of guys and a team effort and certainly our players did
that. douby missed his first fieldgoal attempt in the second half
before connecting on a baseline leaner with  to play in the
game bringing Rutgers within  at  PERIOD

The Douby field goal  his only one of the game 
was the start of a  Rutgers run over the next six minutes
which pulled the Scarlet Knights within three PERIOD

But a solid defensive effort by Robinson and the Wolverines kept
Douby quiet for the rest of the contest as he was unable to get
free for any more good looks at the basket PERIOD

I think us as a team did a great job on him
Robinson said PERIOD When he got past me there was always a guy
there to help him in rotation PERIOD I think that a key part of us
winning the ballgame today was slowing him down. get that outta here Rutgers senior Herve Lamizana  the
teams secondleading scorer  gave Michigan
fits on both ends of the floor finishing the game with a
jampacked box score PERIOD The senior made the most of his last game for
Rutgers finishing with  points  rebounds and eight
blocks PERIOD

I thought he was absolutely terrific tonight
Amaker said PERIOD

Lamizana was all over the place in the first half scoring 
points and adding five rebounds and five blocks PERIOD The senior kept
Michigan from several layups with his stuffs which included a huge
rejection on a dunk attempt from Michigan highflyer Brent
Petway PERIOD

Lamizana continued his rimguarding in the second half sending
back three more Michigan shots PERIOD On several series under the
Michigan basket Lamizana recorded multiple blocks to keep Michigan
away from the rim PERIOD

Hes a great player and he played well
today Michigan sophomore Graham Brown said PERIOD He
altered a lot of shots but we did a good job finishing when we
needed to. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
