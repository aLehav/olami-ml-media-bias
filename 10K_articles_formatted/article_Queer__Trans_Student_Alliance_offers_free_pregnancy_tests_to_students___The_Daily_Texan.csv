The Queer and Trans Student Alliance started an initiative in early October to provide free pregnancy tests to students amid Texas restrictive abortion law that prohibits the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy PERIOD

The pregnancy tests are available for pick up at the William C PERIOD Powers Jr PERIOD Student Activity Center in the Gender and Sexuality Center and the Multicultural Engagement Center PERIOD The alliance also delivers tests free of charge PERIOD Students can request a delivery by direct messaging the organization on Instagram texasqtsa PERIOD

After the abortion ban got passed in Texas we wanted to try to help out on campus with students who may not have access to those resources QTSA codirector Trinity Rust said PERIOD It is really important to get tested if you suspect that you might be pregnant so you can move on from there and this is a way that we thought might be helpful. there are no special requirements and no questions asked for students to access the free pregnancy test QTSA codirector Adrienne Hunter said PERIOD

We really wanted this to be as accessible as possible said Rust a cell and molecular biology junior PERIOD Just go in there and pick it up at your own convenience. hunter said the agency has delivered about  tests so far to students PERIOD The alliance is advertising delivery in West Campus but Hunter said she would deliver a test to someone who lives outside of West Campus PERIOD

I think its even better to have it delivered government freshman Nickoll Santos Garcia said PERIOD Especially for students that might not live on campus or they might feel uncomfortable going to the GSC or WCP to pick up a pregnancy test. since QTSA is an agency of Student Government the organization applied for special project funds from SG to fund the free pregnancy test initiative PERIOD Hunter a fifthyear women and gender studies anthropology and radiotelevisionfilm major said the alliance ordered about  tests for about  and will request more funds if they run out of supplies PERIOD

Hunter said she will continue the initiative at least until she graduates in May but hopes it will remain permanent depending on demand PERIOD

Santos Garica said this initiative makes her feel supported in light of Texas new abortion law PERIOD

I feel very thankful that they have this initiative now Santos Garica said PERIOD Just knowing that there is at least a center where students can go to get these free resources to get information to get help that does make me feel better about someone who attends this University. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin","Queer, Trans Student Alliance offers free pregnancy tests to students â€“ The Daily Texan",University of Texas Austin
