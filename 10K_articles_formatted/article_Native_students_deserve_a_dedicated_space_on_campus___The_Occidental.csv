5501,2022-03-16,"occidental doesnt have a single Native student club or organization PERIOD According to the2021 Class Profilepublished by the Occidental admissions office only two percent of the firstyear students are Native AmericanNative Hawaiian PERIOD With  first years that translates to  Native AmericanNative Hawaiian students PERIOD I found similar statistics for theClass of  which has approximately ten Native students PERIOD I couldnt find statistics published by Occidental for the classes of  or  but the conclusion I came to based on these numbers was that because Occidentals population of Native students is so low nobody has ever called for a platform for them PERIOD

Well Im here to signal that call PERIOD Now more than ever we need to fight for Native rights PERIOD It shouldnt matter if there are five  or  Native students  numbers shouldnt determine access to validation and support PERIOD Native students deserve community PERIOD

My personal interest in the Native community stems from my Native identity PERIOD In sixth grade I proudly told my friends that I was Native American PERIOD No one believed me PERIOD Even though I am a cardcarrying Wyandotte tribe member they concluded that I was lying to get attention simply because of my blonde hair and white skin PERIOD From then on I questioned my validity as a Native person and prefaced statements about my heritage with underlying cracks at how I know I dont look it. i internalized a message that my heritage was not valid PERIOD

I have since hadyears to mature and understand my identity and I am now proud and comfortable with my culture PERIOD I have grown used to the surprise I still meet regarding my appearance in connection to my Native identity but I have also found a sense of community through my tribal affiliation PERIOD

My senior year of high school I was invited to attend the Multicultural Visit Program MVP at Occidental PERIOD Occidental was one of my top choice schools and the prospects of the trip excited me PERIOD When I arrived the other attendees and I were offered opportunities to learn about the groups and spaces on campus for multicultural students PERIOD There was a mixer night where we heard about the many cultural clubs on campus and got the chance to network with club leaders PERIOD

As clubs gave their presentations I kept waiting to hear about a Native club or any Native presence on campus PERIOD I never did PERIOD So after the presentations ended I hesitantly raised my hand to ask about the Native community at Occidental PERIOD I was curious Were there clubs or other platforms for Native students

My question was met with a few moments of uncomfortable silence and a disheartening final response no PERIOD

Feelings of invalidation from middle school came rushing back and I felt defeated I watched as my fellow MVP peers connected with clubs and found a piece of community PERIOD In the place I least expected I was once again left on the outskirts due to my cultural identity PERIOD

I have only been at Occidental for two months PERIOD I thus do not know the entire history of Native students here but in my time at Occidental I have noticed ways that programs have overlooked Native students in addition to the lack of a fixed space for Native students on campus PERIOD I think as a community we can do better PERIOD

I came from a high school in Seattle with annual Native Cultural Assemblies and intentional focuses on supporting Native students PERIOD My school worked hard to encourage both Native and nonNative students to participate in learning about Native culture and this greater focus encouraged my deeper involvement within these communities PERIOD In high school I was involved with a Native club that planned events and collaborated with the administration to provide support and opportunities surrounding Native culture and rights to the student body PERIOD

I knew coming to Occidental that there was a lack of Native groups but I didnt expect the degree to which this was true PERIOD As a result of this I have been less involved in the Native community although not of my own volition PERIOD

The narrative of Native lives is not limited to history textbooks PERIOD Widespread support through events on campus and an intentional focus on Native students would kickstart interest in creating a space dedicated to Native culture PERIOD I want to encourage students faculty and staff to remain mindful of this presence on campus and to look for opportunities to support Native students in larger capacities particularly since many multicultural students experience feelings of invalidation and exclusion PERIOD

In light of National Native American Indian Heritage month in NovemberI hope that a space or club on campus can soon be dedicated to Native students PERIOD
