It is time for educational institutions to wake up and see the future PERIOD And I mean see as in visualize PERIOD The future is here and multimedia is the fad PERIOD Ive been preparing to ride that wave if I could just find the courses needed in the spring schedule PERIOD



I must be missing a page or two PERIOD I dont see an  course PERIOD I looked right next to Production and Operations Management that one was there PERIOD Thats where you learn to manage a manufacturing operation of yesteryear PERIOD



Oh well Ill just enroll in  No dice I looked right next to technical writing business communication and the graphic arts courses PERIOD Someone must have stole that page as well PERIOD



Frustrated but determined not to give up I looked for  Still nada zilch or nothing  however you want to say it PERIOD



With the realization sinking in that this institution lacks any course dealing with management construction and operation of Internet business communications I decided to address the other end of the spectrum  graphics PERIOD



First stop photography PERIOD Only one class offered here folks PERIOD From the looks of it it has been here for a while PERIOD Weve got black and white   heres a camera heres some film lets make a print PERIOD



This is a step in the right direction but wheres the next one Every year I look for photography II but someone seems to think photography stopped with the black and white image PERIOD Look at the rag youre holding turn to the front page I can wait go ahead thats color thats the present and it is the future PERIOD



In five years when youre reading this paper with your DVD reader theyll have to provide more extensive training than black and white photography PERIOD Dont kid yourself paper media for mass distribution is short lived PERIOD



Second stop digital imaging PERIOD Found one class here over in the art building PERIOD Seems the art department has accepted the fact that digital technology is part of the real world PERIOD In an effort to assist students in understanding this theyve created a class that addresses this type of work PERIOD Thank you PERIOD



Now could you help the business computer science and journalism departments by offering basic imaging courses PERIOD You know the ones where you learn to scan photos create cute little animated gifs and construct visuallyappealing web pages PERIOD



A little planning on the part of the faculty and individuals in each of these colleges could produce programs that would educate students with the technology and practices that they will be responsible for when they leave this school PERIOD



The sad part of my reality that struck was the fact that the Student Union Bookstore is more uptodate than any of the colleges PERIOD Im not so sure that mastering one of the many applications they sell photoshop bryce illustrator etc. wouldnt make you  than a completed degree from your college PERIOD



I wish I had a dime for every helpwanted ad on computer job boards that stipulated select software experience and included a  to  salary PERIOD Oh yeah  Can you see the future from Whitehurst If not the bookstore is not that far of a walk PERIOD
