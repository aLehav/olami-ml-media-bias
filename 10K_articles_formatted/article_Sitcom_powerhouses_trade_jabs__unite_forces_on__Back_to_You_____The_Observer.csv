Chris Hine  Thursday September  

When two sitcom superstars  Patricia Heaton Everybody Loves Raymond and Kelsey Grammer Cheers Frasier  star in a new sitcom expectations are high PERIOD Unfortunately the writing and supporting cast of Back to You Wednesdays  p.m. FOX fails to rise to the talent level of its two stars PERIOD

Grammer plays Chuck Darling a womanizing anchorman whose career began in Pittsburgh and led him to Los Angeles where he was fired after an onair outburst of his became a hit on YouTube PERIOD Darling returns to Pittsburgh and reunites with the feisty Kelly Carr Heaton his former cohost to anchor the evening news at WURG  PERIOD

Ryan Church Josh Gad a stressed overweight and profusely sweaty young man runs the newsroom filled with stereotypical onedimensional characters PERIOD Theres the office vixen weathergirl Montana Diaz Herrera Ayda Field the pitiable loser Gary Crezyzewski Ty Burrell and the crazy sports guy Marsh McGinley the always hysterical Fred Willard of Anchorman and Best In Show PERIOD Aside from Willard the supporting cast adds absolutely nothing to the bland and trite material the writers give it PERIOD

But Back to You finds its heart in fivetime Emmy winner Grammer and twotime Emmy winner Heaton PERIOD The pair have undeniable chemistry PERIOD The funniest and best parts of the shows first two episodes were the times Grammer and Heaton were on camera alone together infusing their own comedic styles into their characters prickly interaction PERIOD

But theres more to Back to You than just newsroom comedy PERIOD

Darlings return has more in store for him than he thinks PERIOD Before he left Darling and Carr had a drunken onenight stand PERIOD Nine months later Carr had Darlings child and tried to phone Darling to tell him the news but he refused to answer her call PERIOD The pilot episode takes a turn to the dramatic when Darling finds out that Carrs child is actually his but Carr refuses to let Darling have a place in her daughters life PERIOD

Right now Back to You is rigged with problems PERIOD It devotes too much time trying to make the newsroom funny and not enough time dealing with the urgent problem that exists between Carr and Darling PERIOD Maybe it should focus on the latter issue PERIOD

Grammer playing a character farremoved from Frasier Crane still manages to make the most predictable farce funny with his facial reactions and tone of voice PERIOD Heaton played the unappreciated Debra to perfection on Raymond and here she plays the independent Carr with the same voracity and energy PERIOD Even in the heavy storyline involving Carr and Darlings daughter Heaton and Grammer bring laughs PERIOD

Back to You is nowhere near the quality of Frasier Raymond or other newsroom comedies such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show. christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan the cocreators of Back to You who worked with Grammer on Frasier forgot one of the main lessons of Moore Frasier and Raymond  it takes fullydeveloped wellcast supporting characters and wellwritten scripts to make a great show PERIOD Back to You has none of these elements but Grammer and Heaton make it watchable PERIOD

The writers of Back to You may be mailing it in but its stars certainly are not PERIOD
