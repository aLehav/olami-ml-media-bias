Partly cloudy skies PERIOD Low 53F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The selfproclaimed King of Media all but deposed

by federal regulators recently announced that he will move his

raucous radio program from broadcast to satellite in the process

slipping the tightening yoke of federal decency

standards. we agree with Howard Stern when he conflates U.S PERIOD leadership

regulatory commissions and religious fanatics. scrutiny of his radio show is not new but has intensified since

Janet Jacksons breast was exposed during Januarys

Super Bowl PERIOD That episode was the impetus behind an inexplicable

uproar over decency standards PERIOD Since  stations broadcasting

Stern have been fined more than  million PERIOD

The Federal Communications Commissions which regulates widely

disseminated electronic communications has since January ruled

with a rigid austerity that is incompatible with the freedom of

speech on which democracy relies PERIOD

To believe that the commission which is headed by Republican

heavyweight Colin Powells son is independent

of White House leadership is nave PERIOD Sterns exodus could

be a major media shift and a boon to the viability of satellite

radio PERIOD Initially Stern will reach a fraction of the  million

listeners who currently flock to the show which Stern has

described as bathroom humor. ironically satellite

companies are banking on the prediction that signing radios

most controversial star will bring mainstream marketability PERIOD

That said the most disturbing trend in media censorship is not the

FCCs tenacious persecution of indecency but the content on

which it focuses PERIOD Broadly media regulators have no tolerance of

nudity sex and profanity yet tend to overlook violence and

crime PERIOD

Broadcast television deals in violence and murder every night yet

Howard Stern raises eyebrows for bellowing about breasts and

flatulence

The pattern is clear In the world according to the Bush

administration blazing guns and dead criminals are okay but naked

women intolerable PERIOD Michael Powells FCC is an enforcement arm

of this puritanical agenda PERIOD

We hope Stern continues his reemergence PERIOD After rocketing to

popularity with his risqu shtick in the early 90s

he had slowed to near banality PERIOD Reinvigorated by government

attacks Stern has fired back with brash impudence PERIOD Between fart

jokes and bare breasts Stern lambastes President Bush PERIOD He never

tires of instructing  million sycophantic listeners not to vote

for Bush PERIOD

In November the president may realize Sterns

King approbation is well deserved PERIOD
