There are only four of us in our league Arizona State UC San Diego and UCLA Boone said PERIOD The Sun Devils are our toughest competitors and UC San Diego has been a powerhouse for the last four to five years PERIOD They are a difficult team to beat. arizona State has won the conference championship four out of the past seven years PERIOD The Sun Devils have been to the Final Four once the Elite Eight once and the Sweet Sixteen twice since  PERIOD In that span they have also had at least one player named an AllAmerican every year PERIOD In the November San Diego tournament the Sun Devils got knocked out in the semifinals with a  loss to Chico State PERIOD They finished with two wins over UCLA Humboldt State and the Gauchos PERIOD
