6215,2023-10-08,"i traveled frequently with my family while growing up but it wasnt until recently that I discovered the pleasures of traveling alone PERIOD I use the term alone loosely I wasnt traveling with people I knew but I was meeting people all the time PERIOD The people I met on the road were all very interesting to talk to PERIOD

Over winter break I embarked on a train trip that took me across the United States and Canada PERIOD When I wasnt sleeping on the train I was sleeping in hostels PERIOD I have since fallen in love with these forms of traveling primarily because they foster social interaction PERIOD

Trains and hostels are more interesting stimulating and dollarsaving than the usual hotels and airplanes PERIOD Airplanes are filled with people traveling on business PERIOD They enter sit and basically dont get up until arrival PERIOD Sure its quick but if I have the time I would prefer to see the country PERIOD Hostels like trains are another great place to meet people PERIOD Strangers eat together they drink together and talk with each other PERIOD

My first trip on Amtrak came at the end of last summer when I spent two months in Chicago PERIOD Being a native of Chicago I have flown between Chicago and San Diego several times a year since I was  years old PERIOD It was time to ditch flying and really see what lay between the two cities PERIOD

I set out on a Tuesday afternoon and almost immediately met a guy named J.R PERIOD I was somewhat scared of him as I later found out he had done time in San Quentin PERIOD But when I told him I was going to Oceanside Calif. he got excited PERIOD

He left Oceanside years ago to get away from his drug problem stopped in Oklahoma where his truck ran out of gas and has lived there ever since PERIOD

The drug problem explained his San Quentin time but it was obvious to me that the problem wasnt entirely behind him PERIOD He once grimaced in pain while sitting down because he had a pipe in his back pocket PERIOD Not a tobacco pipe PERIOD Oops you didnt see that he said to me as he moved it to his front pocket PERIOD I did see it and later when he came out of the smoking lounge with some other people I could tell that they had put the pipe to use PERIOD

I was surprised that someone would do such a thing on a train but there was little doubt as to what had happened PERIOD They came out very amused at the most mundane things PERIOD Corn fields were entertaining to them PERIOD Train life was beginning to entertain me PERIOD

Often I am most interested in talking to train personnel PERIOD Apparently I am not the only one as they seem to have heard many of my questions a thousand times before PERIOD I now know where the crew sleeps how well they sleep how their shifts are scheduled what their favorite routes are and why how fast the train travels and even how often people commit suicide by lying on the rails PERIOD I found it a very interesting life and so did many of them PERIOD I also found that not all Amtrak employees enjoy their jobs PERIOD

This winter I traveled to Seattle riding coach on Amtraks Coast Starlight PERIOD There were plenty of drunks on this twoday trip PERIOD Many started drinking in Los Angeles and didnt stop until Dolly the snack car attendant closed the bar completely much to everyones dismay PERIOD

Some guys called her a bitch almost in front of her face and while I thought they were rude they werent that far off I tried to start a conversation with her by asking her how her day was and it didnt go well PERIOD She wasnt having a particularly bad day it was almost like any other she said PERIOD She hated her job PERIOD She sold snacks and drinks all day and no traveling wasnt an interesting aspect of her job PERIOD It got old after four months and that was  years ago PERIOD

She advised me to pick a career I truly enjoy and told me her life was a sad story of someone who didnt do that PERIOD I felt sorry for her and after talking to her over a twoday period I began to understand that she was having a rough time with the drunks on the trip PERIOD When she found out I was a writer she told me I could write a book about the people on our trip calling them the worst group of people she had seen in over six months PERIOD

Little did she know I would end up writing about her PERIOD If any of you are ever on the Coast Starlight seek Dolly out in the snack car and make some small talk with her PERIOD Shes an interesting person and needs someone to talk to PERIOD

On the last leg of my winter journey I spoke briefly with another interesting character a former psychic reader PERIOD She wasnt a true reader but a former phone operator PERIOD She said she initially wanted to be a phone sex operator but got talked into being a psychic PERIOD

Claiming to have experienced deja vu was all it took for her to get hired as a qualified reader PERIOD I didnt ask her to read me but I watched her do a psychic reading on another passenger PERIOD She explained why she said what she said and it all seemed very logical as she was trained to pick up on little hints from people and work her psychic magic from there PERIOD It was all very fascinating PERIOD

The interesting people that I have met during my train and hostel travels are almost too numerous to count the owner of an Internet company in Amsterdam a widow whose husband was a bigtime editor for a Toronto newspaper a student from Hungary a bartender from Scotland and a man who as a baby was allegedly held by William Faulkner PERIOD

Inevitably the discussions would turn to cultural differences PERIOD I discussed music in the United States compared to music in Britain and the Netherlands PERIOD I explained several times to several people how our nations electoral college functions PERIOD I also learned a lot about the attitudes Canadians have about Americans PERIOD Apparently I dont sound like an American. i wasnt sure how to take that but assumed it was a personal compliment from Canadians PERIOD

These experiences have taught me the value of traveling alone and the value of alternate modes of travel PERIOD It seems that people who ride trains and sleep in hostels are of a different class than those who rush through airports and check into Hiltons PERIOD They are often workingclass people and I think that is what makes them interesting PERIOD They are not uppity or snobbish PERIOD I may travel by myself but with this crowd I will never be alone PERIOD
