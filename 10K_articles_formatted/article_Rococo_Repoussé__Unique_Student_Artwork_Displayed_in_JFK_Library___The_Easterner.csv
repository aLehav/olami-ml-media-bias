By Cannon Barnett ReporterMarch  

On display in the JFK Library from Feb PERIOD  until Feb PERIOD  were  repouss depictions of Rococoera art created by Eastern Washington University Art History students PERIOD

Students were assigned to research specific pieces of Rococo art or architecture and then depict their research through repouss  a technique involving pressing a wooden dowel into the back of metal to create designs PERIOD

One of the main tropes of the Rococo is wealth what better way to explore this than creating artwork with a material mimicking precious metals said Anna Cunningham professor of the art history class PERIOD According to Cunningham nothing like this project has been done at EWU before PERIOD

Rococo art is identifiable through its depictions of ornate works of architecture atmospheric landscapes inner circles of the elite class and rich fabrics like creamed frosting Cunningham said PERIOD

One of the primary subjects explored within Rococo art is the true nature of love and all the ways in which love can be experienced Cunningham said PERIOD

One famous piece of Rococo art is called The Swing painted by JeanHonor Fragonard in  PERIOD Studio Art major and Art History student Ash Gordon took inspiration from this picture in creating her repouss piece PERIOD

I think the assignment was really interesting because it was such an unforgiving piece Gordon said PERIOD Typically Rococo style paintings are so soft and romantic and blown out and they dont have rough edges PERIOD I think it was a challenge to create such a soft and romantic painting on a material that is so rigid. while Gordon was unsure if she would be using repouss techniques again in the future she had high praise for the efficacy of the project in helping her retain key information PERIOD

Annie is very big on these handson projects especially in her history classes which is awesome Gordon said PERIOD This will be my tenth year with the school  Ive taken a lot of classes between here and Seattle and this is the first time I have taken a history class where Im really retaining the information. cunningham expressed that the themes of Rococo artwork are valuable for students to see today as there are modern parallels found online in the online world PERIOD

In many ways the Rococo is not so unlike the social media of the eliteinfluencers today PERIOD The imagery produced is not veritable or authentic but rather a falsified display of romance beauty status and wealth. cunningham said PERIOD

Gordon said she hoped that having her and her classmates art up on display in the JFK library would spark student interest in different types of art PERIOD

I think it would be really interesting to see people have a growing interest in the repouss process PERIOD I think its a medium that people dont really work with today and I think its really beautiful Gordon said PERIOD
