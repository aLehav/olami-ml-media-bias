Four years ago in a small Wicker Park apartment recording studio artist Todd Baran embarked on a solo project PERIOD When high school classmate and pianist Chrissy Parisi college bandmate and bassist Cameron Moore and drummer Andy Angelos joined the band the electropostrock tempest When Clouds Attack began

to brew PERIOD

Today Chicagos mostly instrumental quartet roars thunderous tunes at Lincoln Hall  N PERIOD Lincoln Ave. and festivals likethis past Septembers Chicago I Love You. originally driven by postrock influences its most recent album release Young Blood attacked the bands standard postrock catalogue PERIOD Adding a shoegazing electronic twirl to the bands established rock tone the album pushes the sound intoelectrorock territory PERIOD

With two EPs and an LP completed When Clouds Attack continues to challenge Chicagos music standards using a whirlpool of genresat least when the band members arent working theirday jobs PERIOD

The Chronicle sat down with Baran and Moore to discuss performing in Chicago postrock shows and the bands transitioninto adulthood PERIOD

The Chronicle Where did your band name come from

Todd Baran I liked that it had a dual meaning to it PERIOD It can almost be read in a kind of silly or funny way and also more seriously PERIOD But I dont want to say I thought too much on itits a band name PERIOD

Cameron Moore Its pretty common in any instrumental genre You dont use a lot of lyrics or come up with clever phrases so were creatively naming things afterthefact PERIOD

Why the transition from your earlier postrock additives to your new indieelectro sound

TB Primarily we have been less interested in postrock PERIOD Chrissy and I have been playing for almost two years as a duo performing our postrock material and the shows just arent energetic PERIOD Theyre not that exciting PERIOD So we had kind of lost interest in playing that type of music live PERIOD At the same time were starting to listen to a lot more electronic music so that was sort of anatural progression PERIOD

CM Were getting more excited about the electronic aspects PERIOD The shows are definitely more participatory than just a postrock band that you kind of just stare at PERIOD

How do you like operating your music career in Chicago

TB I know Chicago is one of the larger music cities in the U.S. but for us its been kind of an easy progression from starting at local bars and clubs and going up from there PERIOD Its fun to get to know more and more bands throughout the city and it feels like were playing on one team rather than a

big competition PERIOD

What made you decide to work with Carl Saff the Chicago mixing engineer who has worked with bands such as Touch Amor How to Dress Welland Starfr

TB We had been mastering with various engineers in the last few years but we were looking for someone who worked with bands that are in our vein but also for bands that we respect and records that we liked so we called Carl PERIOD

What about adulthood has inspired your most recent album

TB With our recent fulllength LP the central theme is youth and adulthood like the newer generation being ushered in as the older generation gets ushered out PERIOD In some of the songs they just reference that whole energy and others kind of draw parallels in other aspectsrebellion revelationsthose ideas got woven around as well PERIOD

What are you working on now

TB Were trying to take the time to work on new material PERIOD We have about four new songs weve been working on PERIOD Some of its backtothe80s but we just love that type of texture PERIOD Thats just what were into and that just happens naturally PERIOD

CM Its a progression PERIOD Were drawing on slightly different referencessome of the songs might have a little Phil Collins in them  Now were working to combine shoegaze postrock and electropop PERIOD
