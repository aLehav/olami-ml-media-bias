Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



President Bush has successfully proven he has done nothing but given aid to terrorists he claims to be leading a fight against PERIOD Instead of using his family ties to reach a peace agreement with Saudi Arabia he offers them guns PERIOD He is selling weapons to a country with a reputation of producing terrorists PERIOD It seems that President Bush has forgotten where the hijackers came from that crashed our family and loved ones into buildings full of more innocent people PERIOD Where is the outrage I heard seven years ago against the country that raised men to steal our dignity and bring us to our knees Our government instead decides to turn away from history disregarding one of the most horrendous acts of terrorism on American soil PERIOD Our president has started two wars one of them being on terrorism nevertheless he is maintaining economic ties with a country notorious for their terrorist groups as if he is more worried about having a bad relation between the families than the protection of America the duty we entrusted him with PERIOD

President Bush will have his wish of going down in history not as a man who was strong during the terrorist attacks against our country but as a coward who was willing to sell it to the highest bidder PERIOD
