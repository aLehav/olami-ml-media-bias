NCSU Jawaani NC States South Asian acapella team performed the Indian National Anthem and another song on Saturday Jan PERIOD   at Stewart Theatre PERIOD

A cappella is a unique form of music without the use of instruments created solely from a group of people with extraordinary voices PERIOD NC State is no stranger to a cappella with the University boasting several studentrun a cappella groups with a multitude of talent PERIOD Jawaani is one such group PERIOD

In Hindi Jawaani means youth or full of life a fitting name for the group PERIOD Jawaani defines itself as a SouthAsian fusion a cappella group especially during performances PERIOD Marissa Koshy a fourthyear majoring in psychology said this is largely because most of the groups  members are South Asian PERIOD

We try to be different coming on campus Koshy said PERIOD I would like to think that were unique and also bringing some culture to the music platform at NC State. the group has performed at multiple events on campus including Sangeet Saagar and Navarasa however many of their past opportunities have been put on pause due to the pandemic PERIOD In response the fusion a cappella group is actively working to record an album PERIOD

We definitely had some really awesome opportunities Koshy said PERIOD Then the pandemic happened of course but we didnt let that stop us PERIOD We thought that the next best thing would be recording. koshy said the album will span multiple genres  a testament to the groups unique sound PERIOD She also urges everyone to keep an eye out for their release and hopes people enjoy their sound PERIOD

We dont like to stick to just one thing and I think people will see that when they see the songs that we selected for the album Koshy said PERIOD We tried to bring in some classical elements also bring in Bollywood but different aspects of India as well because theres more to India than just Bollywood and more to South Asia than just Bollywood PERIOD Then like with Western music we try to bring in different genres not just like pop music. for Koshy Jawaani is more than just an extracurricular it is an opportunity to be a part of something larger during her time at NC State PERIOD Being a part of Jawaani for her is a way to be seen and heard while participating in singing something she has always loved PERIOD Not to mention lifelong friendships shes formed along the way PERIOD

I feel like the people in our group just get me and I love to hang around them theyre definitely like my family Koshy said PERIOD Also its always so fun to have the experiences that weve had and and to just experiment with music PERIOD I think it really helps to just get out of that studying bubble and join something where I get to use my artistic mindset and also just be around people that are likeminded. koshy encourages anyone who is musically inclined to learn more about their a cappella noting that many of the members have varying musical backgrounds PERIOD

We have people that are classically trained Koshy said PERIOD We have people that have never really learned music but thats kind of the beauty of Jawaani PERIOD Like you dont have to be fully experienced in music to join our group PERIOD We just want to see that you have that passion for music that talent for it. students who are interested in learning about Jawaani especially beatboxers bass or tenors are invited to reach out via Twitter ncsujawaani to submit an audition for spring  PERIOD The application deadline is Jan PERIOD  PERIOD
