For decades the Miami Hurricanes and the Florida State Seminoles have had one of the most distinguished rivalries in all of college football PERIOD From blown leads and miraculous comebacks to tightlycontested duels on the gridiron history has proven time and again that any match between these two powerhouses is bound to be an exhilarating blockbuster PERIOD

The Hurricanes and Seminoles first began their battle for state supremacy in  when Miami blew out Florida State  PERIOD Since then the two programs have competed in  additional games with  of them being decided by one possession or less PERIOD

UM narrowly leads the alltime series with a record of  which was brought within one game in  PERIOD In  the Seminoles embarked on a sevengame sevenseason win streak over the Canes PERIOD Throughout that span Florida State stifled Miamis offense keeping the Hurricanes under  points on four occasions PERIOD UM has since gotten the best of their crossstate foe winning the past four contests PERIOD

The heated rivalry that burns to this day between UM and FSU began in the 1980s when both programs began to assert themselves as two of the best in the nation PERIOD

The early 80s pitted legendary coaches Howard Schnellenberger and Bobby Bowden against each other PERIOD Schnellenberger and the Hurricanes stacked the win column early and often claiming a  record over the Seminoles from  through  when the Hurricanes earned their first national championship PERIOD

The following year Florida State retaliated and humbled the defending national champions with a crushing  victory as Miami adapted to the new leadership of head coach Jimmy Johnson PERIOD The Hurricanes then went on to win the next four contests through  PERIOD

In  the UMFSU rivalry reached a climax PERIOD In front of a soldout crowd in Tallahassee No PERIOD  Miami and No PERIOD  Florida State competed on a field that featured more than  future NFL players  of which were firstround draft selections PERIOD

The Seminoles led the game  with  minutes remaining but in classic Hurricanes fashion Miami owned the fourth quarter PERIOD Halfway through the fourth quarter UM narrowed the deficit on a touchdown pass from quarterback Steve Walsh to Michael Irvin PERIOD The Canes then tied the game on a twopoint conversion and four plays later Walsh and Irvin combined for a 73yard touchdown to take a  lead PERIOD

With  seconds on the clock Florida State quarterback Danny McManus found Ronald Lewis in the end zone cutting the deficit to one PERIOD However instead of going for the tie Bowden made a lastminute executive decision to attempt a twopoint conversion and go for the win PERIOD

We had the extrapoint team in but I changed my mind PERIOD We had missed so many kicks today and the wind was really affecting our kicker Bowden said PERIOD I was just afraid of missing it. an incomplete pass on the subsequent play shut the door on the Seminoles rewarding the Canes a muchneeded win in what would become their second championship season PERIOD Florida State went on to win the rest of their games finishing the season with an  record and second place in national polls PERIOD

After being blown out  in  Florida State got their revenge in  with a  victory over Miami snapping a fourgame losing streak PERIOD However the Hurricanes ultimately got the last laugh and went on to win their third national championship of the decade later that season PERIOD

In  the UMFSU rivalry reached another peak on a day that lives in eternal infamy for Florida State fans PERIOD The No. seminoles  hosted the No PERIOD  Hurricanes  in a game that was held close all throughout PERIOD With under a minute remaining on the clock and Miami leading  Florida State kicker Gerry Thomas missed a 34yard field goal sending the Seminoles home with their first loss of the season PERIOD

The Hurricanes remained undefeated for the rest of the season and secured a fourth national title by shutting out the Nebraska Cornhuskers  in the Orange Bowl PERIOD

To win one national championship is amazing PERIOD For guys to win their second in three years that hasnt been accomplished by many Dennis Erickson UM Footballs head coach said in  PERIOD Thats what makes this championship special and it came in a situation where we had not been picked to be that good PERIOD Some people said wed be No PERIOD  in the state of Florida. as if one gamedeciding missed field goal wasnt enough the UMFSU rivalry features five crucial games decided by whiffed field goals which Canes fans have coined the Wide Right and Wide Left games PERIOD

The second of the series took place the next year PERIOD This time however the wideright field goal attempt would have tied the game as opposed to scoring the goahead points PERIOD

There was no need to look Florida State kicker Dan Mowrey said PERIOD I knew the moment I hit it that it was no good. the Seminoles ultimately fell to the Hurricanes  PERIOD All was not lost however as FSU finished the year ranked second in the country after losing the national championship to the Alabama Crimson Tide PERIOD

Florida State dominated Miami and all of college football throughout the rest of the decade PERIOD From  through  FSU went  against UM and claimed its first two national titles PERIOD

In  however Wide Right III turned the tide in Miamis favor and sparked a sixgame win streak over Florida State that lasted until  PERIOD Within that span UM earned its fifth national championship in  dominating Nebraska once again with a  victory PERIOD Florida States trend of missed field goal attempts also continued into the next century with Wide Left I in  and Wide Right IV in the  Orange Bowl PERIOD

Since then the Hurricanes have struggled to replicate their success versus Florida State and every other team PERIOD Canes Football will enter the  season having gone  versus FSU since  PERIOD The team has been mired in a 19year championship drought since winning five titles in under  years PERIOD In Miamis absence from championship contention FSU added its third title in  to tie the University of Florida for second most in the state PERIOD

While recent history has heavily favored the Seminoles in  the Hurricanes gave them an alltoofamiliar taste of nostalgia that was bitter for FSU fans and sweet for UM fans PERIOD

Florida State led  in the second half before Miamis defense and quarterback NKosi Perry converted two FSU turnovers into touchdowns to bring the score to  PERIOD At the start of the fourth quarter the Canes erased their 20point deficit for good with another touchdown pass to current Houston Texan Brevin Jordan taking a onepoint lead at  PERIOD Then of course FSU crumbled under the pressure missing yet another gamedeciding field goal and surrendering the win to UM PERIOD

While the onepoint thriller now dubbed as Wide Left II may have been a painful reminder of the past for Florida State fans it was a comforting one for Miami fans PERIOD It proved that the rivalry between UM and FSU is still alive and well and if history truly does repeat itself  as it has for  years  then there will certainly be another wide field goal attempt from the Seminoles in the future PERIOD

The win for Miami also granted the Canes their first win streak over Florida State since  and it remains intact going into the  season PERIOD In last seasons duel the heated rivalry gave way to domination as the Hurricanes bulldozed the Seminoles with a  victory at Hard Rock Stadium PERIOD
