Letters to the Editor of The Villanovan As a  year old divorced Catholic and father of a  year old son who is a proud graduate of Villanovas well respected Business School with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in  I would consider myself the last one to write to the Villanovan PERIOD However I have discovered the simple analysis regarding Mine Evers life too cold and too indifferent to the plight that thousands of families like hers throughout America might face PERIOD That plight is taking complete care of a sick child who has serious medical needs PERIOD What happened to but for the grace of God go I. the challenge for all of society but especially the graduates of Villanova University must be can we discover compassion in situations that are exceptionally difficult to imagine PERIOD Will our compassion to assist others be limited to the obvious situations such as Tsunami or Hurricane relief Can we expand our compassion to include those who become overwhelmed in life like I believe Mine Ever may have been subjected to

I like many others who graduated Villanova University do not support the murder of Mine Evers child PERIOD It is my belief this terrible situation is more complex PERIOD I know several families that struggle to take care of children with special medical needs PERIOD First the costs are prohibitive and weigh heavily on many families PERIOD Second the emotional exhaustion is probably even greater than the economic concerns they worry about PERIOD Added to Mine Eners burden of raising a child with special medical needs Mine Ener was most likely suffering from Post Partum Psychosis PERIOD

According to httpwww.4woman.gov postpartum psychosis is a very extreme but rare serious mental illness that can affect new mothers PERIOD This illness can happen quickly often within the first  months after childbirth PERIOD Women can lose touch with reality often having auditory hallucinations hearing things that arent actually happening like a person talking and delusions seeing things differently from what they are PERIOD Visual hallucinations seeing things that arent there are less common PERIOD Other symptoms include insomnia not being able to sleep feeling agitated unsettled and angry and strange feelings and behaviors PERIOD Women who have postpartum psychosis need treatment right away and almost always need medication PERIOD Sometimes women are put into the hospital because they are at risk for hurting themselves or someone else PERIOD

If we add up the pieces of this tragic puzzle a child with demanding medical needs coupled with Mine Ener possibly suffering from Post Partum Psychosis can we begin to develop a sense of compassion for what this proud accomplished and educated woman could have been dealing with Day inday out either both parents work to provide care for their child on top of putting in a full day at work where their employers are not always understanding PERIOD

I noticed the story did not mention the Fathers reaction at all PERIOD Where was he Was he helping Mine Ener was living with her mother in an attempt to provide for her child PERIOD She was unable to cope coupled with suffering from Post partum depression PERIOD She resorted to a choice that everyone understands now was most tragic PERIOD Mine Ener was sentenced to jail PERIOD Mine Ener committed suicide PERIOD I wonder if the popular TV talk show host Bill OReilly would want to swap places with Ms PERIOD Ener I know I wouldnt PERIOD What about her family who must be devastated How does our dialogue begin to reassure them that their daughters life was greater than two awful choices made under an undetected possible medical condition

Now who was Mine Ener She was a  year old woman who had become a successful history teacher at a well respected Catholic University PERIOD Mine Ener wasnt just a successful dedicated and popular history teacher Mine Ener was the well respected Director of the Center for Arab American Studies at Villanova PERIOD As a graduate of Villanova I am all too aware of the unfortunate situation regarding the original name of the new Villanova athletic center PERIOD However I believe this is different PERIOD Just listen to  Villanova graduate Ryan Shafik who considered her  the best teacher I had  at Villanova PERIOD

What surprised me most was knowing that Bill OReilly is a former school teacher whom I thought would have had some empathy for this accomplished yet tragic figure PERIOD I believe that if we examine this issue further Villanova University could very well be commended for their initial choice PERIOD I am dissappointed that Villanova decided to remove the plaque dedicated to Mine Ever PERIOD I am quite confident that the initial idea of commemorating the good in her life was very reassuring and compassionate to her grieving mother and devastated family in a very cynical world PERIOD
