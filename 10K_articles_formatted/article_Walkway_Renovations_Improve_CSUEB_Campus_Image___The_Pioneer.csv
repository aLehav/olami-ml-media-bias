9776,2023-11-04,"university management is tearing up the asphalt on campus particularly in front of Meiklejohn Hall and replacing it with concrete to improve the schools image PERIOD

People would trip on that asphalt said Jim Zavagno CSU East Bays University Planner PERIOD It was hard for wheelchairs to navigate PERIOD Really what it had was some general wear and tear. the asphalt sidewalk leading from Meiklejohn Hall to the New Union was uneven cracked and considered a safety hazard by the Department of Facilities Planning Design and Construction PERIOD

The asphalt will be replaced with a longer lasting but more expensive concrete lined with a brick band in as many places on campus within a  budget according to Zavagno PERIOD

The new Recreation and Wellness Center is a great building but its making the rest of the campus look bad said Zavagno PERIOD

The new building with a new outdoor patio area is the newest jewel of the campus and facilities is ready for the rest of CSUEB to get on the same level PERIOD

In addition to the walkway in front of Meiklejohn facilities plans to landscape more in the center of campus in the coming weeks as well as renovate some restrooms in various academic buildings PERIOD

Were currently in the process of prioritizing the high traffic areas added Zavagno PERIOD Probably first floor bathrooms that get a lot of use in the science buildings and the library PERIOD Were going to do as many as we can with the money we have. the  budget doesnt cover all the bathrooms that potentially need an upgrade but the department is working to get the most bang for their buck PERIOD

In the past we were renovating bathrooms to meet ADA the Americans with Disabilities Act of  standards Zavagno said PERIOD But weve pretty much taken care of that PERIOD Now the bathrooms need a cosmetic facelift PERIOD We should be starting that in the next couple of weeks. while these new projects concern themselves with working on the beauty of CSUEB Zavagno wants to make it known that the demolition of Warren Hall is not forgotten PERIOD

Warren Hall is still very high on the list and very much on everyones radar said Zavagno PERIOD

Warren Hall which has been in plans for a makeover for years is currently in the governors budget to be demolished and rebuilt in spite of the recent cuts to CSU PERIOD

Occupants of the building have not yet been evacuated because temporary offices are still not ready but Zavagno is optimistic that well get the funds to complete the project soon PERIOD

Currently the department is still working on the timeline of having everyone out of the building by the end of this quarter PERIOD
