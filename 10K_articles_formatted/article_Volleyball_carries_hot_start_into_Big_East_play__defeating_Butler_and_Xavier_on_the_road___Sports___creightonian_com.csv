A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 39F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Fresh off of a historic nonconference finish the Creighton volleyball team carried that momentum into Big East play defeating both Butler and Xavier to push their record to  PERIOD

The No PERIOD  Jays opened their quest for an eighth straight conference title on the road winning at Butler  last Friday in a hard fought match PERIOD

Although they fell behind early in the first set Creighton rallied behind senior outside hitter Jaela Zimmermans four kills and senior defensive specialist Abby Bottomleys two aces to take the set  PERIOD

The Jays then won a close second set   bolstered by strong performances again from Bottomley Zimmerman and freshman setter Kendra Wait PERIOD

However on the verge of being swept the Bulldogs countered with a  victory in a close third set PERIOD

I think we let up a bit in the third game Bottomley said PERIOD What we have to realize is every single team plays their best against us and we have to be focused on every point. creighton rebounded well to take the fourth set  for their first conference victory of the season PERIOD

Butler dug us real well because we went up and swung aggressively but they played great defense behind it coach Kirsten Bernthal Booth said PERIOD Obviously we are pleased to get our first Big East win but we have to learn from it and be cleaner. taking their coachs words to heart the Jays indeed came out much cleaner the next day after traveling from Indianapolis to Cincinnati in an impressive  sweep of Xavier PERIOD

Creighton dominated the first set  but found themselves trailing in the second set  PERIOD

Backed by sophomore outside hitter Megan Skovsendes  serving run the Jays went on a  run to take the set PERIOD

The third set saw much of the same domination as the first with the Jays taking a  lead early and never looking back completing the sweep of the Musketeers PERIOD

I thought in game one we played a fantastic game Booth said PERIOD Then in game two Xavier started to play better and we made some backtoback errors PERIOD In game three our serve really disrupted them and it was good to take control. zimmerman led the way with  kills while Wait added  assists in the victory PERIOD Bottomley also added  digs with junior middle blocker Kiana Schmitt registering six blocks PERIOD

Overall I thought we played a really clean game Bottomley said PERIOD Our offense was powerful and our defense was scrappy. bottomleys defense may not have been so scrappy as her efforts on the weekend merited her Big East Defensive Player of the Week PERIOD

Wait earned Big East Freshman of the Week with her performances against Butler and Xavier PERIOD

The team who remains at the No PERIOD  spot in the weekly AVCA Coaches Poll will continue their conference slate with home matches against DePaul and Marquette this weekend PERIOD
