Fanni Hutlassa is the secondhighest scorer this year PERIOD

If most of us were put on another continent and forced to learn the language as quickly as possible we would fail miserably PERIOD The transition would make us angry because of how different everything is PERIOD Not redshirt senior Fanni Hutlassa PERIOD

I already knew English kind of but the first two months when I came here for the summer was the most helpful Hutlassa said PERIOD I still didnt understand much but I picked it up real fast PERIOD Europe is so different from here but its a good different PERIOD Everything was new and exciting so the transition was easy. hutlassa came to FIU from Budapest Hungary in  where she was a

member of the Hungarian U18 national team PERIOD

She played in every game as a freshman before entering her sophomore campaign PERIOD Her season was cut short due to a knee injury PERIOD She thinks her career has gone just about the way she expected PERIOD

It was a little wavy because I had the knee surgery Hutlassa said PERIOD I had a lot to learn but I think I started good PERIOD The knee surgery really humbled me PERIOD It really motivated me. her relationship with head coach Cindy Russo has been interesting to say the least PERIOD The two can be seen on the sidelines getting into about plays PERIOD

We had our ups and downs PERIOD We have known each other for five years PERIOD I know she knows what I can do Hutlassa said PERIOD We have a regular player and coach relationship PERIOD I have to do what she tells me to do and I do it most of the time PERIOD If not she screams at me and I do it next time. russo believes she is an individual who had all the potential in the world PERIOD

Fanni Hutlassa has been a really interesting individual PERIOD Shes full of talent Russo said PERIOD She went out there and did her job PERIOD She loves the game PERIOD She is someone Id keep as a friend for the rest of my life. hutlassa is currently the second highest scoring Panther at . points per game behind the scintillating sophomore Jerica Coley PERIOD She thinks that her success has been great but Coley cant do it alone PERIOD

Jerica is a great player PERIOD She is still young Hutlassa said PERIOD She learns so fast she wants to work with her players PERIOD It helps me a lot because she gets my attention away from other teams. hutlassa is currently finishing up her masters degree and hopes to play professionally after her career is over at FIU PERIOD



One last time



The Panthers are preparing for their final home game of the season against South Alabama PERIOD The team could either become the third seed with the win or the fourth seed with a loss PERIOD Russo doesnt want to worry about seeding right now PERIOD

No because you never know PERIOD Would it be good to meet Little Rock Arkansas in your second game and get it over with or play Middle Tennessee in your third game They are both a tough matchup Russo said PERIOD We could come in third or fourth PERIOD We win these two games and we get Middle Tennessee PERIOD I think that we have a better chance of beating Little Rock than Middle because they are so athletic. after going  in their final road trip of the season against UALR and Arkansas State Russo believes that this team is still searching for an identity PERIOD

We really havent had a game where we have played two good halves Russo said PERIOD What I add that to is a team that doesnt have a personality really doesnt know who they are. russo has become so frustrated with how the team has struggled to rebound that she has actually put caps on the rims so that the team doesnt have anything to shoot at PERIOD

The Panthers could also be without the services of Kamika Idom who went to get an xray on her ankle after practice PERIOD Russo expects her to be available to play PERIOD
