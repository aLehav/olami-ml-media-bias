I debated for the College Republicans at Monday nights student debate PERIOD As a participant Im hardly qualified to judge PERIOD Nevertheless my impression was that the Democrats stole the crowd PERIOD

While I admit that Im biased it seems clear to me that the Republicans held the edge in terms of facts PERIOD We had figures graphs sources and hard numbers PERIOD The Democrats had partisan proObama rhetoric and yet got all the cheers PERIOD While the occasional Republican comment yielded laughter many of the Democrats comments set off applause PERIOD

The Democrats dominated in terms of emotional appeal PERIOD The Republicans were too factoriented too shy on offense PERIOD We lost the emotional debate because we didnt connect with the audience PERIOD The emotional values that Republicans appeal to selfsufficiency patriotism and strong moral values dont resonate with the average college audience PERIOD Democratic emotional values change egalitarianism and redistribution of wealth do PERIOD

Republicans shouldnt give up on reaching college students but we need to change our approach PERIOD We need to get the audience cheering PERIOD We need to focus on values like freedom independence and internationalism values that appeal to students PERIOD And we need to have a healthy College Republican contingent in the audience cheering us on PERIOD
