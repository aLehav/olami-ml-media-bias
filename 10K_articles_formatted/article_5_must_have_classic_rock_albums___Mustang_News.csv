Kyle Loomis is a journalism senior and Mustang Daily music columnist PERIOD

A sure sign of good music is that it endures the test of time and remains popular for generations PERIOD Music that persists with songs that speak to us and inspire us PERIOD Artists who change everything PERIOD

This weeks Polyphonic is devoted to some of the best classic rock that influenced the artists we love today PERIOD These rock legends introduced new sounds and opened doors for other musicians to explore and experiment resulting in the vast diversity of genres we have now PERIOD

The 60s was a period of time that inspired such a large quantity of innovative musicians PERIOD Regrettably I am unable to include everything I think deserves to be mentioned here expect a continuation of this list at a later date PERIOD There is just too much to tell for one edition of this column PERIOD

Here are five of my favorite classic rock albums

 PERIOD Rubber Soul  The Beatles

Any discussion of great classic rock is incomplete if the fab four arent mentioned PERIOD The influence John Paul George and Ringo have had on music cannot be understated and Rubber Soul ranks among their most popular and critically acclaimed works PERIOD

The Beatles began a cultural revolution in the U.S PERIOD after the bands famously remembered performance on The Ed Sullivan Show in February  then known for boyishlycharming pop hits such as I Want to Hold Your Hand. two years and several albums later the Beatles released Rubber Soul  with a dramatically different sound driven by the members urge to experiment with new instruments and lyrically drift away from the conventional love songs that had dominated their style PERIOD

Tracks such as Norwegian Wood This Bird Had Flown which featured the Indian sitar played by lead guitarist George Harrison and Im Looking Through You offer a more pessimistic view of romance and the thenunique distortion on Think For Yourself introduced a new aspect to music that laid the foundation for psychedelic rock PERIOD

Out of the countless groundbreaking albums that made the Beatles rock n roll legends I consider Rubber Soul to be the most important PERIOD This album marked the start of a new breed of rock music and has influenced musicians of all genres since PERIOD That is why I include this album on this list rather than other iconic works such as Sgt PERIOD Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. pERIOD The Doors 1967The Doors

Coming out of Los Angeles The Doors immediately built a popular albeit controversial reputation after the release of the groups debut selftitled album in  PERIOD

Infamously known for lead singer Jim Morrisons vocal prowess unsettling poetry and unpredictable onstage antics The Doors were the shining example of why parents in the 60s likely tried their hardest to keep their kids away from rock n roll PERIOD

When it came to creating controversy there was no better example than Morrisons possibly blatant refusal to censor the drugimplicated lyric Baby we couldnt get much higher during the bands performance of Light My Fire on The Ed Sullivan Show. rebelliousness aside The Doors have deservedly become a staple in classic rock PERIOD The bands use of keyboards especially in Light My Fire and Alabama Song Whiskey Bar and the haunting bellows of Morrison make its music truly unique and timeless PERIOD

 PERIOD Disraeli Gears  Cream

Third on my list is Disraeli Gears the second album release by the British psychedelic rock group Cream composed of guitarist Eric Clapton bassist Jack Bruceand drummer Ginger Baker PERIOD

With a catchy guitar hook and Bruces transcendent vocals the popular single Sunshine of Your Love continues to be a symbol of the classic rock genre PERIOD But Claptons proficiency at guitar is even more evident in the lesserknown tracks of Disraeli Gears. arguably the most gifted guitarist of all time Clapton explored beyond the boundaries of conventional guitarplaying with trippy riffs on tracks like Tales of Brave Ulysses Strange Brew and SWLABR. clapton played a huge role in the evolution of the guitarist and his time with Cream was the catalyst for his extremely successful career PERIOD

When it comes to pure organic talent its hard to beat the individual members of Cream which makes their music essential to have in your library PERIOD

 PERIOD Are You Experienced  The Jimi Hendrix Experience

As one of rock n rolls most tragic stories the world will always treasure the shortlived but extraordinary career of Jimi Hendrix PERIOD Despite being in the national spotlight for only four years the Seattle Wash PERIOD native is celebrated as one of the most influential and adept guitarists in history PERIOD

His band The Jimi Hendrix Experience only released three studio albums and each has a superb collection of bluesinfluenced psychedelic rock tracks PERIOD My favorite is the bands debut release Are You Experienced

The album not only features Hendrixs incendiary playing characterized by amplifier feedback sound oscillation and the wahwah pedal but also delves into imaginative some would say hallucinogenic themes lyrically as seen in the title track as well as The Wind Cries Mary and Third Stone from the Sun. are You Experienced is an album that is an absolute necessity to any classic rock collection PERIOD Hendrix will leave a lasting impression both as a master guitarist and as a singersongwriter PERIOD

 PERIOD Beggars Banquet  The Rolling Stones

There are so many Rolling Stones albums it was almost impossible to choose just one for this list PERIOD After meticulous deliberation I chose Beggars Banquet because of its diversity in content and the popularity of a couple of its songs namely Sympathy for the Devil and Street Fighting Man. sympathy for the Devil explores the evil nature of humanity with contrastingly upbeat instrumentals including percussion reminiscent of samba and Street Fighting Man uses an urgent acoustic guitar melody to accentuate its politically motivated themes of social activism PERIOD

Other tracks on Beggars Banquet are tinged with country influences such as No Expectations and Dear Doctor. parachute Woman is a fun blues tune with some subtle sexual innuendo PERIOD These supporting tracks accompany the two hits well and make the album worthy of mentioning PERIOD

Those albums are also amazing As you may have noticed picking just  albums was seriously tough and leaving out some great records like the ones you mentioned was nearly unbearable as if I did them some great dishonor PERIOD Ill never forget seeing Roger Waters perform Dark Side of the Moon at Coachella  I was literally in tears and for a very long time Abbey Road was my favorite Beatles album Ive got a gigantic poster in my living room PERIOD I appreciate your input and you convinced me to get more into ELO then I previously have one of those bands that I like but not love but Ill check out On the Third Day and see if that changes any PERIOD

Thanks for reading
