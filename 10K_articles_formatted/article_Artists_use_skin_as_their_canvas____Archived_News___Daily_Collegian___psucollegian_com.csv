Downtown district shops might get repetitive with their motley mix of Penn State paraphernalia but there are a few shops where the only place youll find Penn State is on the bodies of their clients PERIOD

Spread throughout the downtown area are shops where tattoo lovers and artists alike converge to appreciate the increasinglypopular craft of tattooing PERIOD

While each shop varies in its approach they have many things in common chief among them a love for the art PERIOD

Crafting Beginnings

Paul Rupeka owner of Ink Inc.  Hetzel St. said he believes a formal classroom setting is not the best way to learn art PERIOD

 Rupeka said PERIOD

Rupeka has owned and operated Ink Inc PERIOD for about  years PERIOD His father was a tattoo artist and Rupeka said it was just a natural thing for him to get into the art himself PERIOD

Instead of a classroom Rupeka said much of his influence came from his parents who were both artists PERIOD

He said that learning in a classroom has one fatal flaw PERIOD

 Rupeka said PERIOD 

Timm Sellers also known as Timmytatts a Penn State graduate earned a degree in art education in  but decided not to follow that career path PERIOD

After graduating Timmytatts said that his current job at Tattoo Marks Studio   E PERIOD Beaver Ave. is much more rewarding PERIOD

 Timmytatts said PERIOD

Local tattoo artist and owner of Good  Evil Tattoos  W PERIOD Beaver Ave. Tony Campbell also decided to pursue his talents outside of the classroom PERIOD He was laid off from his job as a construction worker after  years and chose to move on to tattooing PERIOD

Campbell got a tattoo at Good  Evil Tattoos and started spending time there PERIOD After watching tattoo artists in the shop one of them asked him to draw something PERIOD Once they saw Campbells ability they offered him an apprenticeship PERIOD

He has been tatooing for  years at the shop PERIOD

The Fad That Doesnt Fade

All of the artists have noticed that the demand for their skill is up PERIOD

 said Charlie Verdavoir who works at Good  Evil Tattoos PERIOD 

Campbell said he also noticed a change in the tattooing demographic PERIOD

 Campbell said PERIOD

He noted numerous TV shows such as Miami Ink have made getting a tattoo primetime entertainment PERIOD

Campbell said that the new attention to the art has caused the industry to sell out PERIOD

He also noticed the increased interest in classic tattoo artists such as Ed Hardy PERIOD

 Campbell said PERIOD

Hardys work is the focus of a label that bears the same name designed by Christian Audigier PERIOD Campbell noted how the clothing which once sold for a much higher price is now less expensive PERIOD

 Campbell said PERIOD

He compared the recent trend in tattooing to the previous popularity of choppers which he said peaked five years ago PERIOD Once the trend of owning a chopper died down Campbell said many people were left trying to sell their bikes PERIOD

The recent trend in tattooing he said will probably follow suit but he said that will not necessarily deter people from getting a tattoo PERIOD

 Campbell said PERIOD

Verdavoir noted that the art goes back to the dawn of humanity and that even if the tattooing trend slopes off the industry will not die out PERIOD

 Verdavoir said PERIOD

Dont Do This Do Tat

With the new trend of tattoo popularity Campbell said he has had a decent amount of clients come in with tattoo ideas that he will not bring to life PERIOD

Along with other various tattoos he said he will not tattoo names of spouses or significant others which is a popular demand PERIOD

 Campbell said PERIOD 

Other than that he said that his clients requests run the gamut from normal to strange and everything in between PERIOD

Timmytatts agreed PERIOD

 Timmytatts said PERIOD

Rupeka said that he also gets all kinds of customers with all kinds of requests many of them outside of the norm PERIOD

 he said

Verdavoir said that while some tattoos may be strange the ultimate judgement of the tattoo lies with the client

 Verdavoir said PERIOD

Even though satisfaction with a tattoo lies with the client all of the artists noted that there are certain things they get bored of doing PERIOD

 Campbell said PERIOD

Campbell said lettering bores him while many of the stranger custom tattoo requests can be more rewarding PERIOD He said these requests give him a chance to stretch his artistic abilities outside of the norm which can get somewhat repetitive PERIOD

Timmytatts said one important element is making sure alcohol does not enter the equation PERIOD

 Timmytatts said PERIOD 

While their interests and styles may be different all of the artists agreed that careful preparation for a tattoo is key PERIOD

Keep It Clean

Along with never drinking on the job Rupeka said he also makes sure not to drink too much coffee which would leave him jittery PERIOD A still hand is very important he said PERIOD

Apart from personal preparation Rupeka stressed the importance of having a work station that is extremely clean and free of clutter PERIOD

In a tattoo parlor he said its easy for things to get contaminated which could put clients at risk PERIOD He said that while tattoos may be controversial cleanliness is not PERIOD

 Rupeka said PERIOD

Though the preparations needed for each tattoo might be different Campbell said he finds the same satisfaction in the work that he does PERIOD

 Campbell said jokingly PERIOD
