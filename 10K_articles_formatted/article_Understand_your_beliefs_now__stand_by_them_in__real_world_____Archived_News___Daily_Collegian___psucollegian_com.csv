My Opinion

You know Easter is a funny time of year PERIOD I grew up going to church being taught the religious significance behind the day but all I ever see around me are Cadbury bunnies and crazy colored eggs PERIOD I have yet to understand the connection PERIOD But Easter isnt the only holiday that has been overcome by profitcrazed marketers and Christian holidays arent the only victims either PERIOD

As a matter of fact I think if an uncivilized people were to come to America they would probably think that our countrys holidays are dictated by a company called Hallmark PERIOD

That worries me PERIOD It seems that American society has been desensitized to the importance of any holiday of semiserious tone PERIOD Its almost as if were too scared to face up to the true meanings so we make up cutesy symbols to avoid being confronted PERIOD Then the day just becomes another day off of work another day of picnics another day of football games PERIOD

Every holiday exists for a purpose PERIOD At some point in history a group of people recognized that an occasion was so important that it merited special recognition PERIOD Maybe one of the reasons society takes holidays so lightly today is because we dont take the meanings behind them seriously PERIOD

In order to appreciate the meaning behind a holiday you have to know what you believe in otherwise the day will have no meaning for you PERIOD In my experience people tend to take an informal stance on what they believe only very few are able to defend the conclusions they have come to about life PERIOD Holidays represent only the very front of the problem  the bigger problem is realizing that life should be taken seriously PERIOD The first step in doing this is to carefully think about what youre going to spend your life believing PERIOD

If you dont have any beliefs  thats a problem but a good one to have in college PERIOD In this environment we are surrounded by more different ideas and practices than we probably ever will be in at any one point in our lives again PERIOD Look around and see what other people think PERIOD College is more than classes parties and beer PERIOD Its the time to prepare yourself to be the kind of person you want to be for the rest of you life  something that starts when your diploma hits your hand and you graduate into the 

If you do have certain beliefs do you have them because you know them to be true or because they were passively handed down from your family Either way make them your own PERIOD For me that meant studying the Bibles authenticity and discovering things like the historical evidence for Jesuss life and resurrection and how the Bible was written PERIOD For you analyzing your beliefs could be totally different questions PERIOD But no matter what you shouldnt be afraid to ask PERIOD Beliefs that cant be picked apart and examined arent worth very much PERIOD You would insist on carefully examining a used car you should question your purpose in life so much more PERIOD

The challenging part comes when you start finding out answers which can be rough sometimes PERIOD Again thats the great thing about how many people are here to talk to PERIOD Theres plenty of advice around  just be careful to make sure its truthful PERIOD

The importance of taking life seriously is definitely not a new one PERIOD Throughout history mankind has always had some form of religion to get them through life PERIOD People have realized there is a spiritual side to every person that needs to be filled in order for him or her to be completely satisfied PERIOD Anton Chekov commented on this in his play 



Society may not think this is what typical college students think about and maybe theyre occasionally right PERIOD I think sometimes college students are afraid to express strong beliefs in anything because its seen as closedminded or conservative PERIOD But if we didnt have a mind capable of searching and finding the truth we wouldnt be here PERIOD

Some of us have years before we hit the real world some just a couple of weeks PERIOD Either way being sure of what you believe in is the most valuable lesson you can learn while youre here PERIOD The arena of debate is large  its the perfect opportunity to discover what is truly worthy of your trust  and your life PERIOD

The things were learning now are going to be replaced by newer ideas newer concepts even newer history  years from now PERIOD Our beliefs though if they can be trusted will stay PERIOD Theyll be there forever no matter where you go or what you do PERIOD And in this world where friendships deteoriate empires are overturned in days and basically nothing is permanent  wouldnt it be nice to have something to stand on Something no one can take away from you

For me Easter is a very special time of year PERIOD Not because of the goodies I get in my Easter basket PERIOD Not because of the specials on TV PERIOD And definitely not because I get to have my picture taken with an overgrown rabbit PERIOD Its because for me that one day symbolizes everything I believe in and all the ideas that I hold dear in my heart PERIOD And I wouldnt give it up for anything PERIOD
