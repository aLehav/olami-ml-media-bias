Why Guns N Roses needs a new album

In Damien Chazelles hit movie musical La La Land heartthrob Ryan Gosling and charmer Emma Stone come together to artfully portray two struggling performers living in the fastpaced world of Los Angeles California PERIOD

Mia Stone is an aspiring actress who has been juggling auditions and her parttime job as a barista at a coffee shop on the Warner Bros PERIOD lot PERIOD Sebastian Gosling is a jazz musician who aspires to open his own jazz club in order to revive the music genre PERIOD The two are swept up into a whirlwind romance but must eventually choose between their relationship and their flourishing careers PERIOD

The musical opens with a dramatic dance number people who are stuck in standstill traffic pour out of their cars and flood the streets jumping dancing and singing PERIOD The following few songs are also accompanied by strong choreography all at the hands of choreographer Mandy Moore PERIOD However as the movie progresses the music transitions to softer pieces that use the lyrics to propel the plot PERIOD Composer Justin Hurwitz works in simple yet hauntingly beautiful melodies that will get stuck in your head for days PERIOD

A standout feature of La La Land is the acting PERIOD Gosling and Stone play their characters with such ease that you may feel almost intrusive at times PERIOD In particular during a scene in which Mia and Sebastian are arguing it feels as if you are sitting in on a conversation you shouldnt be because the argument is so realistic and intimate PERIOD The actors feel like real people not like movie characters PERIOD They struggle like most young adults trying to begin a career which makes them relatable PERIOD

The acting however is not the only aspect of La La Land that comes naturally PERIOD Gosling and Stone bring an unrefined sound to the musical numbers PERIOD You never question if Gosling and Stone are actually singing their voices are left essentially untouched with very little voice correction PERIOD There are even moments when their voices crack but it adds to the legitimacy of their characters PERIOD

It seems as if Chazelle was really aiming to keep his plot realistic as well PERIOD In a movie that could easily have a storybook ending Chazelle instead opts for an ending that will leave you disappointed but unsurprised PERIOD In the final dance number Mia and Sebastian float through the rest of their lives as if in a dream but Chazelle snaps you back to reality to remind you that life is not always a dream PERIOD

Although La La Land is a beautiful musical in many ways the cinematography is a work of art in and of itself PERIOD Between the lighting the colors and the cinematography La La Land felt very nostalgic and retro PERIOD In some scenes the subjects were lit by the vibrant colors of a sunset and in others by artificial lighting to create a more staged look PERIOD In some solo musical numbers the lights would dim and a spotlight would rise in order to achieve a more personal atmosphere PERIOD The scenes were often long continuous shots and the camera moved with the subjects rotating around them or sliding frwom one subject to another rather than switching between shots PERIOD Not only does this technique display the genuine talent of the performers but it also makes you feel as if youre there watching the performances PERIOD

La La Land danced its way into the hearts of many including Hollywood itself PERIOD It swept up a whopping seven awards at this years Golden Globes winning every award it was nominated for PERIOD Additionally the film was nominated for  Oscars tying the alltime record PERIOD Chazelle captured young adulthood romance a dying music genre and the competitive nature of life in Hollywood PERIOD While most movies and musicals today have that happily ever after ending it was refreshing to see a realistic one PERIOD Yes La La Land may leave you slightly disappointed PERIOD However with the nostalgic feel the heartwrenching love story and the artistic filming I can guarantee La La Land is a movie you will want to see again and again PERIOD
