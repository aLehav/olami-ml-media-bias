The tournament starts Friday and ends Tuesday PERIOD Freshman Lauren Wagner started play Thursday for the qualifying draw PERIOD

All of the Huskers will be competing at the Central Regionals but senior Mary Weatherholt will only be participating in doubles play PERIOD Weatherholt is still recovering from an injury PERIOD

In Tulsa the Huskers will be playing against competitors from Iowa Minnesota Oklahoma State and Arkansas along with many other nationally ranked schools PERIOD

Going into the tournament the Huskers have had close to two weeks off from competition PERIOD They have used this time to come together and work as a team PERIOD Assistant coach Hayden Perez has contrasting feelings about the time off PERIOD

While I dont like the time off from competition I have loved the time we have had together Perez said PERIOD

Prior to the first tournament of the year the team didnt practice together PERIOD Now they have had time to practice together PERIOD This has benefited the team substantially PERIOD

I believe the kids have really pushed each other to improve Perez said PERIOD

Senior Stefanie Weinstein has appreciated the time off that they have had from competition PERIOD

This time has helped a lot Weinstein said PERIOD We have really been concentrating on our returns and on our hitting. weinstein has a new doubles partner this year fellow senior Janine Weinreich PERIOD Last year she paired with nowgraduated Madeleine Geibert and they created one of the best doubles pair in Nebraska history finishing with a  record PERIOD Weinstein and Weinreich are learning to play with each other PERIOD

Of course I am upset Madeleine is not my partner anymore Weinstein said PERIOD But it is nice playing with Janine because we are both German so we can speak in German to each other. this dynamic German duo may have the benefit of sharing a common native language but they still have a few obstacles to overcome PERIOD Despite those obstacles they have already earned an ITA ranking at No PERIOD  PERIOD

It is just hard getting used to each other on the court and being able to predict where the other one is Weinstein said PERIOD

Weinstein said she is excited like the rest of the team to show everyone at the ITA Central Region Championships what Nebraska tennis is about PERIOD Last year the team ended the tournament with a  singles record and a  doubles record PERIOD

The fall is about building toward the spring season Perez said PERIOD I would love to see some kids do well and get some confidence before the winter break. sports
