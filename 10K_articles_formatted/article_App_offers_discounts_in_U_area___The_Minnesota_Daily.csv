About  University of Minnesota students looking for deals at campusarea restaurants are using a new app developed by a team of University students and alumni PERIOD

With College ByME an app launched Sept PERIOD  users can secure deals at area businesses using Apple and Android smartphones PERIOD

Chad Olsen a recent University graduate two current University students and another recent college graduate developed the app PERIOD Olsen said he got the idea for the app because he was always looking for good deals when he was in college PERIOD

ByME was created to link students directly to their campus PERIOD The app has worked with more than  businesses to bring students deals said David Bardan a junior in the Carlson School of Management and one of the members of the team PERIOD

Bardan said the company has racked up more than  in total savings PERIOD

One such deal at Raising Canes helped break the businesss record for most sales in a day PERIOD

We basically are the direct channel of retailers to students and students to retailers Bardan said PERIOD

For now the app is only available for University students but the team is hoping to expand its efforts to other college campuses PERIOD

The app is made specifically with students in mind said Peter DipoAjayi a University junior and the marketing manager for the app PERIOD He said it was made by students for students PERIOD

Who knows students better than students Olsen asked PERIOD

The app deals are unique to the University said senior Leilah Abdennabi who has used the app since it came out PERIOD It works with popular places that many students already go to PERIOD

I used it twice last week Abdennabi said PERIOD Its cool PERIOD It saves us money. the main goal of ByME is to create an exclusive community for students Olsen said PERIOD

Besides giving out deals to University students the app features a shoutout feed where students can post something that is visible to everybody else using the app PERIOD Students on the shoutout board post about what they are doing where they are eating and what deals theyre finding PERIOD

One student Lukas Poggensee posted on the shoutout board Woohoo finally have a ByME smartphone

There is also a campus map and a campus feed of updates blogs or other announcements from ByME PERIOD

I think its convenient definitely Abdennabi said PERIOD I think they could do more with it though. while the app features a map of the area from Google maps Abdennabi said she would like to see one unique to the University campus with halls and businesses listed on it PERIOD

Bardan said the team is working on putting out the next version and bringing the app to larger schools in other areas PERIOD
