All season Edgardo Goas has been looking for a second option across the court from Joe Sunder PERIOD

In January Sunder posted a careerhigh  kills in the Outrigger Invitational against Hawaii and throughout the year hes been Goas clearcut No PERIOD  target for the Penn State mens volleyball team PERIOD

As the season wore on Sunder has taken fewer swings for the No PERIOD  Nittany Lions while Goas has found other options especially in sophomore Tom Comfort and freshman Jace Olsen PERIOD

Comfort and Scott Kegerreis have been battling for time all season to become the second option to Sunder PERIOD Comfort has seen the most time as of late leading the Lions with  kills Sunday against Ohio State hitting at a . clip PERIOD

Coach Mark Pavlik said both Kegerreis and Comfort have been practicing very well over the past few weeks and are starting to show it on the court PERIOD

I just think they battle Pavlik said PERIOD Tommys had a little more opportunity to do it on the floor but Scottys getting his chances PERIOD Theyre competitive but this is as cooperatively competitive group as weve ever had. in  Comfort posted  kills in the Lions second match of the season against Hawaii PERIOD Pavlik then moved Will Price who graduated after last season to opposite cutting the thenfreshmans playing time PERIOD Comfort finished the season with just  kills PERIOD

This season Comfort has made the most of his chances PERIOD The Orchard Park N.Y PERIOD native ranks second on the team in kills with  behind only Sunder PERIOD

Inbetween games against Ohio State Goas told Comfort to be ready because hes one of their hitters and everyone has confidence in him PERIOD

Since the season has gone on Tommy has become one of my goto hitters Goas said PERIOD Its awesome to have another guy you can trust and you can set at any time during the game. comfort said starting slow has been one of the main problems for the team this season and especially for himself PERIOD

He was taken out of the match during the second set against Ohio State being replaced by Kegerreis before finishing the match strong PERIOD

Energy is pretty much the driving factor for this team and weve been working all year long on getting better starts Comfort said PERIOD Pav and Jay told me we have to find out how I can get started faster against Ohio State. there has also been a battle for time in the middle for most of  PERIOD Sophomore Nick Turko has played in all but one match this season while Ian Hendries who established himself as the Lions most consistent blocker went down with a left ankle injury against Ball State on March  PERIOD

Senior Alan Mars has stepped in for Hendries who is still nursing his ankle but has dressed the past two weekends PERIOD Pavlik said he would like to get Turko some rest before the EIVA tournament begins and also get Hendries back on track PERIOD

Nicks been a workhorse and hes serving the ball really well Pavlik said PERIOD Even though we didnt give him a lot of sets Sunday the ones he did get he put away with some authority. with an underclassmenladen team taking the floor each night Pavlik said the importance of experience at the setter position has been vital in the offenses maturation PERIOD

Pavlik said at the beginning of the season the offense was a work in progress but Goas has done a great job settling the team down and allowing the younger hitters to mature PERIOD

The fact that Eddy has confidence in the rest of his hitters is huge Pavlik said PERIOD As a fourthyear setter Goas understands what hes looking for and can take advantage of it. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
