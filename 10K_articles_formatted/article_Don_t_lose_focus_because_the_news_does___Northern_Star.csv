Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Matt WierJanuary  

As you pull up to the stoplight an approaching car catches your eye in the rearview mirror PERIOD Your gaze follows it into the lane next to yours and the driver meets your eyes and feathers the throttle signaling a challenge PERIOD You reply with a quiet roar of your own and palms begin to sweat as you grab the steering wheel and shift knob PERIOD

Finally the light glows green and rear tires spin on both vehicles PERIOD While all others are left in the cloud of vaporized rubber at the intersection you trade leads with the challenger until the nose of your vehicle finally edges ahead and is first to reach the finish line  a stoplight PERIOD

All the actors in the play please take a bow PERIOD The winner is a news story fed by the media and fattened with sensationalism possessing the power to muscle its way to the front pages PERIOD The opposition is a contending story with a lot of momentum but the interest in it falls short PERIOD Then there are the sane drivers still back at the starting line  stories pushed to the back page of the paper and perhaps a minutelong followup on the nightly news PERIOD Finally the lead actor All of America please take a bow PERIOD We are the stoplight PERIOD

We are that start and finish line the track that the media uses to try and grab our attention PERIOD

But just as car companies churn out faster cars new stories are constantly turning up to overtake others and demand our time PERIOD Sometimes our society and thus media move too quickly for our own good PERIOD

Matters deserving of our time and consideration are often replaced with either whatever becomes more important or something that is just more sensational PERIOD

An example of this can be seen from these past winter months PERIOD Colorado and some surrounding areas received enormous quantities of snow PERIOD

While many have been put in danger it is the cattle that present the major crisis PERIOD Huge numbers of them are at risk and thousands are already dead PERIOD A similar storm in  as related by a Jan PERIOD  Associated Press article resulted in the deaths of more than  cattle and a rise in beef prices nationwide for the year PERIOD

I have not noticed a single news story about the crisis since the days immediately surrounding the snowfall PERIOD It would seem the medias and Americas short attention spans have moved on PERIOD

But how does this crisis not deserve the same lasting attention as events such as Hurricane Katrina

Maybe its because the devastation in the wake of that natural disaster was surrounded with much more sensational stories accusations of the government fumbling its responsibility rioting and murder etc PERIOD

While there is no doubt that the effects of Katrina will be felt for a long time the same is true of the cattle crisis PERIOD

Also stories like Donald Trump and Rosie ODonnells public feud seem to have greater staying power and prominence than world crises like terrorism war and famine PERIOD Once again sensationalism wins the day PERIOD

We are the stoplight society PERIOD We control the pace at which the media feeds us our information  at which we accept it PERIOD The stoplight can turn green  we see the headline say thats interesting and turn the page to something more interesting PERIOD

Or we stay red a little longer  take some time to be wellinformed filter out the sensational excess and participate knowledgeably in this world PERIOD What color is your stoplight If its green you probably arent even reading this because your eyes are already darting to the next page PERIOD
