In the wake of Sunday nights Oscar ceremonies conversation has swarmed around which films were surprise winners as well as which films were snubbed and not chosen for specific awards PERIOD These types of conversations are relatively inevitable following any large awards ceremony PERIOD Those who were expecting or wishing for different results voice their displeasure in a makeshift rally cry for artistic justice PERIOD

So when Monday morning came around I woke up fully prepared to read plenty of compelling arguments for some of the years best films that underperformed at the Oscars this year PERIOD After all Boyhood took  years to shoot and it essentially ended up losing to a Michael Keaton comeback story albeit a beautifully orchestrated one PERIOD

However when I logged onto my computer I saw that it was actually American Sniper that was garnering the largest attention PERIOD The Clint Eastwooddirected film was nominated for six different Oscars and only took home one award for Best Sound Editing PERIOD Apparently many were expecting it to win Best Picture PERIOD

I went online to find out what argument was being brought to the table only to find an overwhelming amount of people throwing around the movies box office numbers to argue that it should have won more awards PERIOD It is true that the film has made much more money at the box office than any of the other movies nominated for Best Picture PERIOD In fact as of the night before the Oscars it had made over . million already PERIOD

Nevertheless my response to this argument is one of sheer amazement PERIOD Box office results no matter how staggering do not equal Academy awards PERIOD If we were to limit the Oscar winners down to a simple schema based on box office blockbusters then we would be including topgrossing films like Maleficent and Transformers Age of Extinction in the category for Best Picture PERIOD It wouldnt make any sense at all PERIOD

After all twothirds of all Best Picture recipients since  actually lost at the box office according to data collection by Box Office Mojo PERIOD This shows how popularity is a proper measure of monetary value but not of artistic value PERIOD If monetary gains were indicative of true artistic value then we would arguably have to contact Stephanie Meyer and let her know she deserves the  Nobel Prize in Literature for her record sales of the Twilight series PERIOD Ill let you decide if that should be the case PERIOD

Studios often throw large amounts of financing at their films to create something visually stunning PERIOD American Sniper achieved record feats at the box office for its studio PERIOD It achieved an even greater feat in portraying the story of Chris Kyle a man whose courage and sacrifice I could never hope to match or deny PERIOD Also undeniable is the elegance and courage with which Chris Kyles widow Taya Kyle has been handling the medias spotlight PERIOD Hence its not hard to understand why the film is so popular and heartfelt in the first place PERIOD These are the arguments I was surprised were not as frequent as they were replaced by irrelevant references to the films revenues PERIOD

Maybe I just have a problem getting over the fact that American Sniper visibly used a fake baby during shooting PERIOD It isnt the biggest deal in the world but it certainly seems more relevant than waving around box office numbers as though you have a winning lottery ticket PERIOD
