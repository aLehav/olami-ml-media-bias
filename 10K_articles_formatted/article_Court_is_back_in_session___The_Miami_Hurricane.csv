Its not too often that both the mens and womens basketball programs are generating a buzz not only around campus but nationwide as their seasons get set to kick off PERIOD

The women coming off a share of the ACC title last year and a No PERIOD  seed in the NCAA Tournament have infinite potential this season as they come barging into the  season ranked seventh in both the ESPNUSA Today and the Associated Press preseason polls PERIOD

The men after three underachieving seasons since the teams last NCAA Tournament appearance have made a coaching change from Frank Haith to former George Mason Head Coach Jim Larranaga PERIOD The Canes are projected to finish fifth in the aptly competitive ACC PERIOD

Meier brings winning tradition to Miami

When you play basketball at Duke if nothing else you will learn how to do one thing win PERIOD

Womens head coach Katie Meier now in her seventh season at the helm for the Canes is bringing that tradition and mentality down south from Durham N.C PERIOD Her experience playing for Duke even helped win her a share of the National Coach of the Year Award last season PERIOD

The No PERIOD  ranking for the Canes is their highest since the final poll of the  season and the highest preseason ranking the team has ever earned PERIOD

Thats a really big honor Meier said when the rankings were released PERIOD Were going to have fun with it PERIOD Youre a fool if you dont take a moment to step away and enjoy it. the Canes return every one of last years players PERIOD That team far exceeded all projections and finished  in ACC play with a perfect  home record PERIOD

It is an honor to be recognized with all these great players said preseason firstteam AllAmerican Shenise Johnson PERIOD But what really matters is that we reach our teams goals and hopefully I can be a part of the postseason team. a year ago Johnson registered averages of . points . rebounds and . assists per game PERIOD

Shes done exactly what she set out to do Meier said PERIOD Shes been the face of the program. joining Johnson in the potent backcourt is fellow senior and Wooden Award preseason nominee Riquna Williams PERIOD She is looking to expand on a season that saw her lead the ACC in scoring at a pace of . points per game PERIOD

The Canes also boast the additions of the 6foot6inch center transfer Shawnice Wilson and freshman guard Suriya McGuire both complements to the core that has already been established PERIOD

Fans can look forward to a challenging schedule this year as the Canes will play nine games against teams ranked in the preseason top  PERIOD

Larranaga looks to turn Canes into ACC contenders

There is only one word to describe the mens basketball teams last season frustrating PERIOD

When the team blew a 19point lead in the second half against North Carolina in the ACC Tournament it was hardly a surprise PERIOD That served as a microcosm of the whole season  blown leads and poor second half play PERIOD

Miami has the talent on this roster now they just need the right coach to turn them around PERIOD

Who better to take over the reigns than the man who made George Mason University a household basketball name Jim Larranaga took the Patriots to the Final Four as an 11seed in  in a miraculous run for a midmajor program that will always be recalled when a new Cinderella story develops in college basketball PERIOD

Larranaga now inherits a team with  of  players returning PERIOD He understands the challenges ahead in getting his team to transition from the style of play they were accustomed to under former head coach Frank Haith PERIOD

Whenever youre developing a new system it takes the players a while to adjust Larranaga said PERIOD A coach cant adjust to  different styles but  people can adjust to one new style. the Canes will be led by the backcourt duo of senior Malcolm Grant and junior Durand Scott PERIOD Grant was named to the Preseason AllACC team after leading the conference in threepoint field goals made three point percentage and free throw percentage a year ago PERIOD Scott led the Canes in scoring last season with . points per game PERIOD

Miami needs bulk and strength up front to complement the quick backcourt PERIOD The teams premier big man Reggie Johnson will be out until January with a knee injury and senior forwardcenter Julian Gamble will miss the entire season with an ACL tear PERIOD

The Canes hope Florida transfer Kenny Kadji can provide the reliability Larranaga needs from his big men until Johnson is back and ready to go PERIOD

The two teams will keep the BankUnited Center busy on Friday as both are slated to commence their regular seasons The women kick off the loaded day at  p.m PERIOD against TexasPan American and then make way for the men to take over for the night shift at  p.m PERIOD against Tennessee Tech PERIOD
