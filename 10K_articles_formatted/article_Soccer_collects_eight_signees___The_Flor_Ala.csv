The North Alabama soccer team added eight new names to the  roster Feb PERIOD  some of which were a mile a way while others were on the other side of the world PERIOD

The new signees include three international prospects from Finland England and Australia PERIOD From the United States UNA landed one player each from Indiana Illinois and Georgia PERIOD Two of the earliest signees came from Alabama including Florence High School standout Mary Margaret Borden PERIOD

We have a real diverse group said UNA head coach Chris Walker PERIOD Overall I think we strengthened some of our weaknesses from the past season and just added to the depth of the team. borden a  defender won the  Times Daily Player of the Year award PERIOD She also received an AllArea selection an Alabama NorthSouth AllStar slot the Golden Boot award and was Florences team MVP PERIOD

She will come in and compete for playing time straightaway Walker said PERIOD She was great at Florence and we expect her to continue to improve and keep it going. joining Borden in the defense is Taylor Farmer of Dallas Georgia and Emma Stice of Sycamore Illinois PERIOD The three will hope to replace the likes of Alyssa Bova Susan Lang and Samantha Parrish who graduated from the team last season PERIOD

In the midfield UNA added Lexi DeCamp a  prospect from William Henry Harrison High School in West Lafayette Indiana PERIOD UNA returns all three starters from last years midfield in Beatriz Fernandes Margarida Sousa and Kristen Sinden PERIOD

I think were gathering some good weapons Fernandes said PERIOD We need some help and I believe that the recruits that are coming in will help a lot if not this coming year then the next year when we go to Division I. with the loss of senior forward Ele Costello UNA added three forwards to join the likes of junior Kylie Huey and sophomores Shelby Wall and Audrey Tanner PERIOD Madeline Guillen Sara Litmanen and Shalom College transfer Kate Ennett hope to help bolster the front line next season PERIOD

Rounding out the  class is goalkeeper Charlotte Johnson from Bridport England PERIOD Johnson will compete with current goalies Kate Webster and Savannah Stewart immediately Walker said PERIOD

This recruiting class has been in the works since last August Walker said PERIOD

All eight of them have been done for a long time Walker said PERIOD Its not like football where theyre deciding today where theyre going to school PERIOD We couldve signed this class six months ago so todays just another day PERIOD But its nice for the girls to sign and that we can finally talk about it. walker said he believes all eight players embody the highcharacter personalities he seeks PERIOD

Away from the soccer field weve spent a lot of time recruiting this group Walker said PERIOD You can be the best player in the world but if your personality isnt going to fit what weve already got we will look in a different direction PERIOD

I think studentwise and personalitywise this group of eight will add to what weve already got here PERIOD Theyre great students and they all have good grades PERIOD Theyre the right people we want to bring to UNA as we take that step forward with our last season in Division II. the Lions will play their first of four spring games March  when they host AlabamaHuntsville at the UNA soccer complex PERIOD

The new recruits will join the team next fall PERIOD
