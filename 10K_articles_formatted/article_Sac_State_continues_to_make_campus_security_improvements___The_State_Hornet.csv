After a series of  mass shootings including one in Las Vegas that killed  and injured  many people expressed concern over how prepared Sacramento State and other college campuses would be for a potential shooting PERIOD

At the time Sacramento States Police Chief Mark Iwasa said that campus alert systems needed to be improved training procedures could be implemented and all campus building locking systems needed updating PERIOD

Since then a series of updates have been made including the addition of selflocking doors in some halls and updates to emergency notification systems according to the university PERIOD

All doors in Mendocino Hall have had locks installed and can be locked from the inside according to an email received by The State Hornet from Sac State university spokesman Brian Blomster PERIOD

They do not have to be locked by a central control said Blomster PERIOD That means there is no delay in locking. blomster said that locks for another  classrooms have been purchased and are in the process of being installed though he did not specify in which halls the locks would be located PERIOD

Eventually locks will be installed in all classrooms on campus as well as doors to common areas line offices and main front doors Blomster said PERIOD He did not specify when the entire campus will have this technology installed PERIOD

In  Iwasa said that tests of Sac States alert systems went badly and that the system overall required improvement PERIOD Since then the university has updated its campus alert system with text messages being received by students and faculty sometimes in a matter of seconds Blomster said PERIOD

Blomster quoted Iwasa as saying the system is super responsive when sending text alerts which he added are the main way most students receive alerts and that desktop alerts worked well PERIOD

An activeshooter training video created by California State University is posted on Sac States website PERIOD The video is available in both English and Spanish.It is comprehensive but easy to watch and absorb Blomster said PERIOD It focuses on the run hide fight response that experts support. according to Blomster Iwasa said the campus is in full compliance with building evacuation training and that every building on campus has completed the training PERIOD

Blomster added that every building coordinator responsible for helping people get out of a building if necessary has received handson training PERIOD A list of all building coordinators is available in respective buildings PERIOD
