We teach a general overview of the crosscultural context of international business management and provide a countryregion specific examination of the challenges that face international managers Richey said PERIOD Throughout the course the issues of culture and ethics are examined and then we take them to a country and have them dig deep into the culture by learning to do business in emerging markets and studying culture norms habits etc. provided that students do dig deep into what the city of Istanbul and the country of Turkey have to offer students have to focus on welcoming a culture that isnt like their own Richey said PERIOD

They need to open their minds and lose their cultural baggage he said PERIOD America is an island compared to Europe and Asia and we have to recognize that anyone should be empathetic to cultures rather than judgmental. hopping off the island to learn different ways of business is a unique way of learning the different cultural norms that come along with Turkish businesses PERIOD Hardline negotiations highquality products doing everything based on trust and taking their time to be accurate are all attributes Richey lists to describe Turkish business people PERIOD
