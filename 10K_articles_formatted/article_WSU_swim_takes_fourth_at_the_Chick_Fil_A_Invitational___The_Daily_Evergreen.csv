PARKER R PERIOD SCHAFER Evergreen columnistOctober  

WSU had a successful twoday meet this past weekend in California PERIOD The team came in fourth overall behind three very skilled teams PERIOD

The Cougars sit behind the University of California UCLA and San Jose State University PERIOD

A big reason that the team placed fourth was their lack of a diving team PERIOD Without a diving team the swimmers lost out on a lot of points that could have put them higher in the rankings PERIOD

We are sitting fourth behind two impressive Pac12 conference teams and the defending Mountain West champions but today was one of our stronger swims as a team and Im excited to see how we respond to an important session tomorrow head coach Matt Leach said PERIOD Weve done a good job in preparing and executing a plan so far and Im excited to see our studentathletes continue to improve and be hungry to race. one of WSUs first wins of the meet was with freshman Dori Hathazi who came in first for her 200yard butterfly PERIOD Hathazi currently holds the Gibb pool record for the 200yard butterfly with a time under  minutes PERIOD

There were many incredible swimmers at this meet many of whom placed high in their races PERIOD freshman Emily Lundgren took second in her 200yard breaststroke PERIOD Junior Josie Liebzeit placed fifth in her 1650yard freestyle PERIOD NoelleHarvey Angela Di Palo and Kirsten de Goede placed third together in the 400Yard freestyle relay earning good points for the team PERIOD

Even though the team does not have a diving squad WSU is looking promising for their season PERIOD
