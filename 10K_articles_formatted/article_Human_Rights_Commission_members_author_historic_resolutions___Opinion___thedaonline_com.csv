The Morgantown City Council voted Tuesday to endorse two progressive resolutions advocating for the rights of West Virginias LGBTQ citizens their partners families and allies PERIOD

Both resolutions The Resolution in Support of the Employment and NonDiscrimination Housing Act and The Resolution in Support of Marriage Equality Legislation call on the West Virginia Legislature to pass laws that would bring our state up to speed with the rest of country PERIOD

This might not seem like a big deal  a gesture made a local government  but for West Virginia its a huge step in the right direction PERIOD

West Virginia remains among the few states still resistant to the waves of progress that have swept across the country in the past decade PERIOD

Finally a group of people has posed the question many have been wondering for a long time Why does West Virginia still not have statewide protections for sexual orientation or gender identity

So lets take a moment to pause and applaud that group the Morgantown Human Rights Commission PERIOD The sevenmember panel worked together in December to author the pair of resolutions for the councils consideration PERIOD

According to its website the commission was established in  with a mission to provide leadership for addressing community interaction and fairness concerns and ensure the city is not only providing services but maintaining ways in which a community can live together inclusively functionally and justly despite differences complexities and conflicts. michael Fike Frances Whiteman Anne Marie Lofaso Jan Derry Anna Marlen Savino and Don Spencer make up the current commission one seat is currently vacant and are those directly responsible for the historic resolutions PERIOD

In the The Resolution in Support of Marriage Equality Legislation the commission states that although its members hold varying religious and personal view points on LGBTQ issues it is a fundamental uniting principle of our organization that all people are entitled to equal rights... if only all leaders and politicians could be this egalitarian the world would quickly become a much better place PERIOD
