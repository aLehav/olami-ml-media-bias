Updated November     pm





A Port Charlotte local braves the flood waters with a small metal boat to check on neighbors across the street PERIOD Many residents left the relative safety of their homes to venture out and check on one another following the hurricane sharing supplies and stories while trying to still comprehend what had occurred PERIOD



At around  p.m PERIOD on Sept PERIOD  Category  Hurricane Ian made landfall in southwest Florida PERIOD The storm and its unpredictable nature led many to believe it was to hit farther north striking the Tampa Bay area PERIOD However it swung south at the last moment PERIOD These are the stories of those who stayed as well as those who left only to be brought back into Ians path PERIOD

Preparations

The morning of Sept PERIOD  gave way to blue skies and calm seas  the type of weather that made the Gulf Coast of Florida famous PERIOD The light sea breeze and sun beams gave a lightness to the day PERIOD This day was not for enjoyment however for it was evacuation day PERIOD Students packed textbooks and computers beer signs and their favorite pillow and retreated to the houses of close friends and families and hotels in far away cities PERIOD The afternoon rolled in with an entourage of thunderstorms bringing about a foreshadowing of what was to come PERIOD The highways out of the St PERIOD Petersburg peninsula filled with evacuees seeking shelter from the powerful forces steadily advancing PERIOD



A man strolls past Five Bucks Drinkery on the  Block of Downtown St PERIOD Petersburg where businesses and bars boarded up in preparation for potential storm surges and winds PERIOD In an attempt to lighten the atmosphere of the intense situation signs such as this communicated messages of hope and cracked jokes like When it rains we pour. motorcycles shot through gaps of cars that created an inching river of glowing red brake lights PERIOD As the time passed however some roads calmed to their standard amount of commuters PERIOD The only piece out of place the ominous glow of the churning grayish yellow sky rain still falling upon the ground PERIOD The old saying goes red sky at night sailors delight red sky in the morning the sailors take warning  yet no delight came from the sky that day only a warning of incoming threat currently barreling down on Cuba and the Florida Keys PERIOD



Laurel a St PERIOD Petersburg local and boat owner in the Boca Ciega Bay drags her dinghy boat from the flats to finish tying down and preparing her sailboat for the incoming Hurricane PERIOD In her four years in the area this would be her first experience being confronted with possible disaster to the extent forecasted for Ian PERIOD

The Eerie Calm

At the seawall overlooking the St PERIOD Pete pier the first band of the storm  a solid wall of dark blue  slowly approached the coast PERIOD According to the radar the band would be here within the hour and the rain would not relent until two days later PERIOD The pier stood tall in the face of the coming storm but the fresh windows and trees still held up by wooden beams bred a certain level of discomfort to many passersby PERIOD A steady influx of waves beat against the oystercovered seawall occasionally splashing over its older more deteriorated sections PERIOD Yet these waves are but a taste of what is to come  a mere taunting of the storms strength PERIOD



A local rests on the seawall of Vinoy Park in Downtown St PERIOD Petersburg PERIOD In the distance clouds from the first band of rainfall from Hurricane approach the coastline PERIOD

A skeleton crew of locals walked the downtown seawall either blissfully unaware of what was approaching or facing it head on vying for a glimpse of the first possible hurricane to directly hit the Tampa Bay area in over  years PERIOD

As Sandy a Vinoy Park local living within evacuation zone A walked away from the waters edge to eventually evacuate to Clearwater flocks of parakeets noisily took flight leaving the park that gives her stressfree peace of mind in times of strife such as these PERIOD She hoped that upon her return her cherished park will look the same as the day she left it unwavering and untattered by the rain and tides coming with Hurricane Ian PERIOD

When she moved here from Venezuela four years ago the risk of a hurricane was the last thing on her mind as she wanted nothing more than to live on the water PERIOD



St PERIOD Petersburg native a resident named Sandy looks into the camera after taking one last stroll to her favorite park Vinoy Park before evacuating PERIOD The risk of a hurricane never crossed her mind as she moved to Florida rather her focus was finding a place to live where she was able to see the water PERIOD

It had never crossed my mind and I am struggling leaving my home and my life behind right now PERIOD I would be staying if it werent for my daughter telling me I have to go she said PERIOD

Sandys story isnt unlike many St PERIOD Petersburg residents as the storm of a century isnt something you ever consider could come tomorrow until it does PERIOD

Yet the approaching stormfront was not aggressive at this time PERIOD Its looming presence is a silent one coasting on steady winds pushing it east PERIOD There were no intense greens yellows and reds that many become so familiar with when watching a hurricane on a radar PERIOD Calm and darkening shades of blue were what dominated the skies hovering over the choppy gray and blue water PERIOD

The winds intensified PERIOD The storm inched closer and St PERIOD Petersburg a city famous for its lively nature went quiet and took shelter from one of the oceans most powerful forces PERIOD



Taking advantage of the intense winds from Hurricane Ian kiteboarders brave the rough water and worsening conditions to blow off some steam and catch some air by Skyway Bridge PERIOD When asked why they would be out on the water with a strong hurricane on its way one kiteboarder simply put it this is where the winds at PERIOD



Into the Storm

As the storm inched closer Ian hit a patch of extremely warm water in the Gulf of Mexico fueling its swirling mass PERIOD This led the National Weather Service to upgrade the Hurricane to a Category  which according to the National Hurricane Center consists of sustained winds ranging from  to  miles per hour PERIOD This ranking system known as the SaffirSimpson Hurricane Wind Scale does not take into effect the possible devastating storm surge and rainfall flooding that so often accompanies these powerful storms PERIOD

As Sept PERIOD  wore on the winds howled louder and louder PERIOD But it was wind that would end up sparing the entirety of Tampa Bay from calamity PERIOD A stray cold front from the north early for this time of year in Florida would nudge the storm off its presumed course PERIOD Nervous St PERIOD Petersburg residents checking their radar like clockwork watch as the storms path changed to instead make landfall miles south taking aim at Fort Myers and its neighboring cities PERIOD Areas with less preparation and evacuation orders were now going to experience the full force of a Category  Hurricane PERIOD St PERIOD Petersburg would not be swallowed by the sea today PERIOD

On the seawall the rough seas and pounding waves that battered the stone and concrete just days before were quiet PERIOD The storm on its course due south ripped millions of gallons of water out of Tampa Bay leaving much of the coast a mucky sandbar almost a half a mile wide in some areas PERIOD



A flock of ibis take advantage of the exposed seagrass beds for a possible meal at Maximo Park across from the Omega dorm complex PERIOD Once Hurricane Ian went south the storm pulled large amounts of water out of Tampa leaving large expanses of sea grass above the water line PERIOD

Seagrass and the creatures that inhabit its thick growths lay disoriented in the now exposed land the water they used to survive now being thrusted through coastal homes and streets in the near south eventually leading to the widespread flooding of the Myakka River watershed PERIOD The scene shared a stark contrast with one another here boats lay stranded in the sand while just to the south marooned citizens watched as vessels floated through the streets pushed by the seemingly endless waves and powerful wind PERIOD

Aftermath

By the morning of Sept PERIOD  the storm had already left its toll and west coast Floridians held their breath as they emerged from their places of shelter eager to survey the damages left behind by Ian PERIOD Downtown St PERIOD Petersburg remained empty aside from service workers and police officers patrolling the streets PERIOD Street lights remained out and a thin layer of leaves and palm fronds covered the usually bustling sidewalks PERIOD

Around every other street corner a downed tree would appear but businesses boarded up with sayings like no ice cream for Ian remained standing PERIOD The waterfront too was largely unscathed only a few battered sailing boats and several toppled trees were what seemed to be the extent of the damage PERIOD This was a mere fraction of what laid to the south PERIOD



Large pieces of plywood dawning warning messages to the storm itself protect the storefront of businesses in downtown Gulfport PERIOD

Traveling down I75 trees all pushed into the same direction revealed the strength of the winds PERIOD Metal highway signs were left mangled on the sides of roads PERIOD The closer to the coast the more intense the destruction PERIOD In Port Charlotte north of Fort Myers along the Myakka River roads were in good condition if they were only dawning a few inches of flood water PERIOD



A residential street in Port Charlotte two days following the storm PERIOD Large trees and power lines hang low over a flooded road after being toppled by the Category  winds rain and flooding forming impassable barriers for residents still in their homes

Unfortunately this was not the case for all PERIOD Residential streets looked as if they reverted to their primordial state downed branches and trees and flooded streets resembling more of a canal within the Everglades than a neighborhood PERIOD Fish traversed the roadways as neighbors utilizing kayaks and flat bottomed boats slowly paddled past downed power lines and flooded cars to check on friends and relatives close by PERIOD



Fish swim through the street as a Port Charlotte couple survey the damage surrounding their home PERIOD According to the couple the flood water had already retreated a large amount with waves coming up into their garage during the peak of the storm PERIOD

Houses looked like islands as residents sat outside their homes trying to escape the confining heat from within the residence while still being grateful to have a house to retreat into PERIOD Some vehicles brave the sometimes three foot flooded streets  now unmarked as not a single street sign is left standing upright  passing abandoned waterlogged cars that also sought to reach the nearest open gas station or store for supplies PERIOD



Locals in Port Charlotte utilize kayaks to traverse the flooded neighborhood streets to check in on neighbors PERIOD

On the coast over  feet of storm surge rushed into neighborhoods and streets sweeping away cars and houses alike PERIOD Mobile home parks were some of the hardest hit areas PERIOD Swelling and twisting waves piled the small buildings into immovable heaps of metal PERIOD A group of children from a mobile home park some with houses intact as well as some whose houses were destroyed played in the flooded streets with one another while others sat quietly on the side still trying to understand what just happened PERIOD



Children escaping the intense heat jump into the newly formed waterways PERIOD Before this image was taken one child exclaimed my house is gone citing the widespread destruction seen throughout the coastal trailer park communities that did not receive an evacuation mandate PERIOD

Winds of  mph threw shallow rooted trees across yards with the most sturdy of trees reduced to bare sticks  their leaves ripped from their stems and blown away PERIOD Sand still imprinted with the motion of rough ocean waves covered the streets and sidewalks calling back to the sand dune origins of these once vibrant and lively communities PERIOD

Not Out of Harms Way

Senior Reilley McHale who evacuated to her familys house in Venice is one of many students who ventured farther south from St PERIOD Petersburg expecting the storm to continue on its path north PERIOD McHales experiences during the storm were far from what she expected PERIOD

Like many people McHale could not flee out of state for a hurrication a term that she finds offensive because of the devastation so many experienced PERIOD Preparations were made to the best of their ability by her family but McHale still could not shake the nervousness that came with riding out the storm so close to its path PERIOD

I wanted to leave Venice my parents did not because Eckerd talked a lot about how bad this hurricane was going to be McHale said PERIOD They said the hurricane is not going to directly hit us well be fine. yet to the dismay of McHale and her family the storm shifted putting them directly in Ians path PERIOD For  hours the McHale family was battered by Category  strength winds and rain with a massive storm surge on its way PERIOD Soon enough water began to enter the house PERIOD



Reilley McHale senior evacuated to Venice Florida after receiving the mandate from Eckerd PERIOD What was an attempt to escape danger however brought her directly into the path of Ian where she endured  hours of intense conditions PERIOD

We lost power probably around like noon went in a closet around noon and then stayed in the closet until probably like  p.m PERIOD when our house started to flood McHale said PERIOD So then we moved to higher ground a bed within the house so we could put all the pets and all of our stuff on the bed so it wouldnt get flooded and soaked. storm surge coupled with massive amounts of rainwater that had nowhere to go continued to gather outside the McHale household slowly moving its way inside PERIOD The house was still calm however compared to the intensity that was just outside those walls with over  mile per hour winds raging through Venice PERIOD

By this time a backyard fence had fallen creating a bowl effect that funneled even more water into the house PERIOD The water had nowhere to go but up and then it slowly started to seep into our back living room and then started coming from every direction in the house  like you slowly feel the carpet start to get cold PERIOD And then water started coming underneath your foot PERIOD And the next thing you know its like mid calf high of water McHale said PERIOD

More water kept coming and a sobering thought came over the family as McHales parents began to call family members PERIOD

You know listening to your parents call their parents and be like I love you Its kind of depressing PERIOD But we had the goal that everyone was gonna make it out of this circumstance she said PERIOD

Stuck between rising water and a roof protecting them from torrential rain and powerful winds the McHale family hunkered down together PERIOD Pets and all they huddled together to ride out the worst of the storm as best they can eagerly waiting for the storm to relent its fury on Venice PERIOD



McHale who saw the most support coming from her friends and family was also frustrated by the increasing popularity of this ordeal being a hurrication. to her this idea was incredibly offensive discounting the experiences of the millions of people whose lives were changed by Hurricane Ian PERIOD

After the hourslong ordeal the water began to recede allowing the McHale family finally a sense of relief PERIOD But the storm did leave a lasting impression on the family not to mention the extensive flooding damage to the house and two cars PERIOD

Coming back to Eckerd McHale says the most help came from her family friends and professors that went above and beyond to make sure that she and her family were okay following the storm PERIOD This along with a sense of dark humor to help cope with the ordeal her and her family went through McHale says that she is now doing much better and is adjusting to life poststorm PERIOD She says she has also gained a new appreciation for what really matters in life PERIOD

You really learn the value of like stuff can be replaced PERIOD People cant when youre in a situation like that McHale said PERIOD

Now about a month after Hurricane Ian struck there is still a long road to recovery for families and communities of southwest Florida PERIOD As life returns back to normal for many who were unscathed millions others are left to make decisions of how to go forward without belongings their houses and for some their loved ones PERIOD
