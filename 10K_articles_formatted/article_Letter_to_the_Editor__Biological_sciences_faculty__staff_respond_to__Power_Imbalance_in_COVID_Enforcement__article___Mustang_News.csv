Cal Poly San Luis Obispos News Source

This letter was written by a group of biological sciences staff and faculty PERIOD The views expressed do not necessarily reflect those of Mustang News PERIOD

A recent Mustang News story about inconsistent compliance with Cal Polys pandemic safety policies included some controversial statements by a faculty member from the Biological Sciences Department PERIOD One statement implied that members of our department shared these controversial views PERIOD

Therefore the undersigned faculty and staff of the Biological Sciences Department wish to make our positions clear PERIOD

Specifically we acknowledge

A That masks are an effective way to slow the spread of infectious respiratory diseases including SARSCoV2 PERIOD Thus we fully support university state and federal guidance on maskwearing PERIOD Since department and university policies require everyone students staff faculty and visitors to wear masks at all times in public spaces on campus  especially indoors  it is important for faculty to model appropriate behavior for our students irrespective of any personal belief we may have about these policies PERIOD

B That the use of terms such as Wuhan virus or Chinese virus to describe SARSCoV2 is inflammatory and offensive to members of our community PERIOD The use of such terms has been specifically discouraged by the World Health Organization PERIOD Given the rising violence and discrimination against AsianAmericans and Pacific Islanders it is important to communicate in ways that do not promote division discrimination and racism PERIOD This is especially important for university employees who because of their positions often have a voice that is heard more clearly than others PERIOD

C That there is an inherent power imbalance between students and facultystaff PERIOD We are committed to providing ways for students to express their discomfort with the behavior or language of any member of our community without fear of retaliation PERIOD

D That the burden of the pandemic has been felt unequally and that members of our community have lost friends and loved ones PERIOD Our words about it should be rooted in respect for the experiences of others PERIOD

We are committed to providing all our students the opportunity to achieve their goals in a supportive community and an atmosphere of love empathy and respect PERIOD
