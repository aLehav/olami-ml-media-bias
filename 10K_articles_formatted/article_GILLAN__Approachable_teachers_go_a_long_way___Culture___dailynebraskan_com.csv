When youre only a month into your freshman year of high school no one knows what groups or clubs they fit into just yet PERIOD

Everyone is awkward no one is sure of themselves and theyre all hesitant to try new things PERIOD Unless that is your sixfoottall best friend grabs your 5foot2 body by the forearms and forcibly drags you through the halls to an introductory speech team meeting after school PERIOD

Here began my fouryearlong speech career and what is now a sixyearlong friendship with Nolan or as we knew him then Mr PERIOD DeWispleare our 23yearold English teacher and speech coach at the time PERIOD

Nolan welcomed the crowd of students that had found their way into the meeting PERIOD A slightly shorter man of many voices and hand gestures Nolan was just the character to coach a speech team PERIOD

Im actually insane PERIOD I told you all the first day I was crazy. easy to talk to and equally easy to get along with Nolan remains a constant influence and example of the kind of person I want to be PERIOD I visited him recently and we reminisced about my days before college

Nolan spoke of the day he met me and my friends at the speech meeting PERIOD We were an odd bunch to say the least PERIOD All freshmen girls none of which had Nolan for a teacher and therefore none of which he knew PERIOD We were foreign entities PERIOD

For the first few weeks we didnt know which one of you was Maura and which one was Mary Nolan says falling out of his chair laughing as he recalled those many years ago when my best friend Mary and I competed as a duo PERIOD All we knew was that we had these two freshmen who wanted to do a Duo and who seemed to sort of know what they were doing acting wise. for the longest time I was referred to as the short one. whether he knew my name or not though thankfully he did learn Nolan and the speech team gave me a place to belong when I needed it most PERIOD Unlike my brothers I wasnt any good at sports no matter how hard I tried PERIOD After failing at volleyball I was lost on what to do with my time PERIOD I knew I had a knack for talking and as I learned under Nolans guidance people would give you medals for that PERIOD Nolan took my purposeless effort and turned it into something far more productive and satisfying something award winning PERIOD He knew how to push me as a competitive speaker turned me into a district finalist and eventually got me to state PERIOD That was a confidence boost which would last me a lifetime PERIOD

After I graduated high school I decided to attend a few Monday night meetings as an assistant coach and eventually became a regular coach which Nolan always seemed appreciative for PERIOD

Growing up in David City Nolan had many participation opportunities in high school most of which he jumped at PERIOD Speech journalism theatre tennis choir cross country track were a few of the things he did at school PERIOD His days regularly ran from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD Aside from his extracurricular activities he also held three jobs and competed with a city based soccer team PERIOD

Ive held a job since I was .I grew up being busy he said PERIOD My parents were busy PERIOD My siblings were busy its what I come from. he continued with band journalism and tennis in college and so the juggling act went on PERIOD This was something I personally admired about Nolan because it was an issue I frequently dealt with PERIOD Aside from speech I also performed in school productions worked backstage on the construction and costume crews and played flute in band frequently overloading my plate with work and school PERIOD Nolan exemplified a way of life that was both busy and happy PERIOD With a double major in english and history his semesters regularly consisted of  to  credit hours PERIOD

Today Nolan not only coaches speech but also both the boys and girls tennis teams as well as serves as the faculty advisor to the student newspaper and most recently the yearbook PERIOD About  to  hours of his day are spent at work PERIOD At home awaits his wife Ashley and  year old daughter Ellie PERIOD They are anticipating another child as well who has been affectionately named Towel by its older sister PERIOD

Nolan has played many roles in my life throughout my high school career he was Mr PERIOD D speech coach and sophomore English teacher PERIOD After I graduated as I began to regularly attend the practices as a coach he became my boss and he repeatedly insisted I call him Nolan instead of Mr PERIOD D PERIOD This took some getting used to PERIOD

And eventually he became a friend PERIOD

In him I found a fellow busy body and language loving lunaticand taught me that one can be busy and happy though one might have to sacrifice a little sleep PERIOD
