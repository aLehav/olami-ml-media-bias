With a rise in the number of sexual assaults being reported on campus Grand Valley State University is going the extra mile to ensure all community members are informed on the procedures to take regarding sexual misconduct PERIOD

The Division of Inclusion and Equity has teamed up with Get Inclusive to create an online training module to educate the campus community about Title IX and Clery Act reporting PERIOD

The module was sent to all university employees via email and needs to be completed by Sept PERIOD  PERIOD The goal of the module is to create more awareness about prevention response procedures and reporting PERIOD

Title IX is part of the United States Education Amendments of  PERIOD The law prohibits any education program activity receiving federal financial support to discriminate based on sex or gender PERIOD Educational institutions must also respond promptly to any report of sexual harassment or violence PERIOD

The Clery Act goes handinhand with Title IX as it requires universities to disclose complete and accurate data about reported incidents that have occurred on or near the campus PERIOD The goal is to promote transparency and ongoing communication as well as empower community members to take action in ensuring safety and security PERIOD

Providing this training to employees will assist in increasing awareness about sexual misconduct and sex and genderbased harassment said Theresa Rowland Title IX coordinator at GVSU PERIOD It also promotes responsibility to report incidents to the Title IX coordinator and in sharing campus resources like GVSU Victims Advocate University Counseling Center and GV Police Department. the module takes about  minutes to complete but does not have to be completed in one session PERIOD The answers given are completely confidential and any personal information is not disclosed PERIOD

When the module is started the user is notified genderneutral language will be used and the content may lead to triggers for some PERIOD For those concerned about triggering content there is a hotline number provided for support PERIOD

The online course begins with basic information and definitions and outlines GVSUs policy regarding sexual misconduct PERIOD This includes sexual assault sexual exploitation intimate partner violence and stalking PERIOD The module provides indepth descriptions and video aides PERIOD Once this portion is completed the user moves on to the educational and reporting portion PERIOD

This portion educates the user fully on Title IX and the Clery Act PERIOD The user is also informed about the Office for Civil Rights defining sexual harassment and reporting sexual harassment and violence PERIOD

All employees who do not complete the module by Sept PERIOD  will receive follow up communication from the Title IX office PERIOD

The Grand Valley Police Department will continue to send out timely warnings when any sexual misconduct takes place and will continue to inform the community through the investigation PERIOD

When I get those alerts about sexual assaults happening on campus its scary because it can happen to anyone said Sarah Soave a junior at GVSU PERIOD But seeing that GVSU is really taking action makes me feel better its obvious that theyre looking for solutions. oct
