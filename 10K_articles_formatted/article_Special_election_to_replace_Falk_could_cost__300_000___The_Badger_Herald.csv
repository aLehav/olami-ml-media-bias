2730,2010-10-17,"a summer special election to fill the seat of County Executive Kathleen Falk could cost up to  according to the Dane County Clerk Office PERIOD

Supervisor Eileen Bruskewitz District  said members of the Dane County Clerks office told herself and other Dane County Board members the election which would be held if Falk resigned this April could cost up to  PERIOD

Bruskewitz said she would prefer Falks resignation to come in December rather than April to allow Aprils municipal elections to include Falks replacement PERIOD

There are not a lot of special elections in Dane County Bruskewitz said PERIOD Its common that most people who are leaving office have the courtesy of not putting the taxpayers to that expense. bruskewitz added she believes Falks responsibilities left as executive including the Dane County budget would mostly be finished by the time December comes allowing Falk to step down with ample time to allow an April election PERIOD

Although some confusion still surrounds when the election will be held Falks office maintains she gave proper notice to Dane County before the election PERIOD

Falks spokesperson Josh Wescott said Falks attorneys are still working with state attorneys to hammer out a full understanding of how state statutes dictating special elections affect the current scenario PERIOD

Just like jobs in the private sector an employee out of respect to hisher employer tries to offer as much notice as possible when heshe resigns to allow the employer ample time to find a replacement and allow for a smooth transition Wescott said in an email to The Badger Herald PERIOD The countys attorney continues to believe a notice of resignation with an effective date is sufficient for calling an election and is consistent with state statute. bruskewitz said she believed Falk could have consulted Wisconsins Government Accountability Board earlier who announced early this month that Falk would not be able to step down in April without having a special election in summer  PERIOD

Instead Bruskewitz said she opposed Falks decision to consult the County Corporation Counsel before consulting the Government Accountability Board and announcing her decision PERIOD

Supervisor Al Matano District  said his knowledge of the current state of the situation led him to believe the election will be held in April to avoid spending taxpayer money for an extra election PERIOD
