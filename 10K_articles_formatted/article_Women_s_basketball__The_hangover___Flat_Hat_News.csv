8455,2023-11-05,"the joy following William and Marys seasonopening drubbing of Cornell Friday wore off Monday when the team fell to Richmond on the road  PERIOD

The Spiders controlled the game from the jump opening up a  advantage at the  minute  second mark in the first half PERIOD The College  briefly found its footing though and went on a  run to close the gap to  PERIOD But the Tribe couldnt overtake the Spiders who went on to outscore the Tribe  in the final  of the half and head into the locker room with a  lead PERIOD

Neither team hit its stride on offense in the first  minutes as both teams struggled shooting the ball PERIOD The Spiders shot just . percent from the floor in the first while the College knocked down just . percent of its shots PERIOD The difference though came from behind the arc PERIOD Richmond hit  of  of its threepoint shots in the first half while the College couldnt connect on any of its four tries PERIOD

The Tribe opened up the second half with a run of its own PERIOD Senior guard Katherine DeHenzel looked to turn the Tribes threepoint luck around knocking down the first shot of the half from downtown PERIOD Ultimately the College would cut Richmonds advantage to six after a layup by junior center Jaclyn McKenna with  remaining the game but that was as close as it would get as the Spiders began to dominate the low post outscoring the College  in the paint over the final  minutes PERIOD

Richmond guard Abby Oliver also took over in the second scoring  points on  of  shooting in the final period PERIOD

Neither team was particularly careful with the ball as Richmond  turnovers were only slightly better than the Colleges  PERIOD

The Tribe was led by DeHenzel who finished with  points four rebounds and seven steals PERIOD Her halfopening threepointer was the only of four Tribe shots that fell from behind the arc in the second half PERIOD Junior forward Emily Correal also pitched in with  points and  rebounds but her six turnovers proved costly PERIOD
Once again the College was hurt by the absence of its leading scorer last season senior guard Taysha Pye who was suspended by head coach Debbie Taylor for violating team rules PERIOD Its unclear when she will be allowed to return to the court PERIOD

The Tribe will return home when it takes on Navy Friday night PERIOD
