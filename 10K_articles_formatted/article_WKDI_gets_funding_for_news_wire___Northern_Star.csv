Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Tammy SholerFebruary  

The Student Association Finance Committee Thursday ratified  to pay for a news wire service for WKDI in the  school year that was almost zerofunded by the SA Senate last semester PERIOD

The United Press International UPI wire service enables WKDI to report the weather sports and international news PERIOD The controversy over UPI stems from a fiveyear contract the university signed in  which gives WKDI access to the wire PERIOD

The SA Senate argued that NIU obligated SA funds without their knowledgealthough each time the university purchases a service a contract is involved PERIOD The SA is not always aware of the contracts but they fund these contracts anyway said Jon Dalton vice president of student affairs PERIOD

In addition the finance committee passed funding of about  for paid executive positions including  for a chief engineer  for the general manager the business manager and program director  for the music director sales manager promotion director public affairs director and sports director as well as  for the sales commissioner PERIOD General Manager Kirk Moore said this is the lowest amount requested in about three years because WKDI did not request money to pay for assistant managers as they have in the past PERIOD

Besides receiving money for paid positions the station also will be able to continue doing their live sports talk shows from the Stadium Club with the  the finance committee allotted for the phone bill PERIOD This money is for regular calls the station makes as well PERIOD

With the  request the finance committee OKd WKDI will be able to purchase two new turntables to replace the current nineyearold ones PERIOD With these funds WKDI also can buy a four track production tape deck and two horns for the remote system PERIOD Moore said the horns are needed to improve the sound of the remote system PERIOD They also received  for travel expenses to the remotes PERIOD Remotes are important because they are a big part of the fund raising for the station he said PERIOD

Another  was approved for magazine subscriptions slander and libel insurance ads and registration fees for a conference in Chicago PERIOD At the conference WKDI employees will learn how to better run the station from professionals in radio and other college stations Moore said PERIOD

The remaining funds approved were  for production and promotional supplies  for printing of fliers playlist and billing forms and  for office supplies including cassettes and reeltoreel tapes PERIOD

The station produces about  in revenue from the remotes and poster sales PERIOD SA Treasures Lisa Schlepp said in the past WKDI had predicted a revenue figure of  but they have never been able to produce that much revenue PERIOD

The station also requested  in supplemental funding which would enable several members to attend a conference in Austin Texas the large producer of the independent music which is the heartbeat of WKDIs music said David Fishman music director PERIOD

Fishman said professionals and other colleges will attend the conference which would help the station make new connections and provide the station with free promotional materials PERIOD The request failed  with one abstention because the conference is not worthwhile for the cost said SA Sen PERIOD Michael Stumpf PERIOD
