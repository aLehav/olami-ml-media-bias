Its really important to know that there is a particular military culture associated with someone who has been in the military PERIOD Theyre not the same as an undergraduate coming out of high school PERIOD If youre from a military family there may be impacts of kids in schools having to deal with their parents deploying for a long time and just the transition that people make said Marchetti PERIOD

The UNC Charlotte Department of Social Work and College of Health and Human Services applied for the UNC Charlotte Chancellors Diversity Grant last year PERIOD Marchetti worked together with Amy Barsanti to write the grant PERIOD

We really hope that our college community will become more aware and culturally sensitive to military culture and how it might be different than you or I who havent been in the military PERIOD Also in our community what can we do Were going to have hundreds of thousands of veterans coming back going to school and looking for jobs PERIOD You see it on the news all the time about people that theyre going to be hiring veterans PERIOD But really what does that mean and how do you successfully see their strengths said Marchetti PERIOD

In addition to the multitude of events taking place at the conference there will also be combat art on display PERIOD The  pieces of artwork that will be on display were created by UNC Charlottes very own student veteran Rob Bates PERIOD

In addition to showcasing his combat art Bates will also be a part of the student veteran panel PERIOD

What I found really interesting was that UNC Charlotte was founded for veterans so I thought it really was very appropriate that we should take the lead in trying to enhance awareness on campus said Marchetti PERIOD

We want to make this a warm and veteranfriendly place said Marchetti PERIOD
