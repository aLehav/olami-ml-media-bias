San Diego State student Jessica LaFontaine used car2go for two weeks after her car broke down.LaFontaine said she couldnt afford to rent a regular car and only needed to drive a few hours during the day PERIOD LaFontaine said through car2go she spent  roundtrip driving to her job in Downtown and had no wait time compared to the  day pass she would buy for the hour long trip via trolley PERIOD

A lot of people who dont have cars I recommend them to use car2go LaFontaine said PERIOD

Car2go vehicles can be found anywhere within the service area PERIOD After paying a  start up fee members receive a swipe card to open and activate the car PERIOD

There is a smartphone applica tion to help locate nearby car2go vehicles.The longest Ive had to walk to get to a car was maybe  minutes LaFontaine said PERIOD

This new electric car service has its merits but when the electrical storms hit San Diego last week the car2go company went out of service PERIOD Lightning caused the member ID card to deactivate and as a result some members could not start their car2go vehicles PERIOD

No one was harmed because of the deactivation of the membership card PERIOD

Even after this glitch LaFontaine said she would gladly use the cars again and recommends students who dont have a car or are short on cash to consider this ecological option PERIOD",Eco-friendly cars available â€“ The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
