Re  Feb PERIOD  column PERIOD I would like to start off by saying that the author is right about one thing Thon would not have survived if it werent for the IFCPanhellenic label PERIOD It has become a competition between the greeks and it is because of this that Thon has such longevity because they are the highest money raisers PERIOD

You forgot an important segment of Thon participants The thousands of independent students who dedicate themselves to Thon PERIOD How many students freeze on street corners who are not greek How many overalls captains committee members and Thon chairs are not greek I have held the latter two positions and I am not in a sorority PERIOD Both took a lot of time and work so you can bet that being a captain and overall are full time jobs PERIOD It takes a full year to prepare for this event not just four weekends PERIOD

Did you ask your roommate how it was to stand for  hours That  is a huge mental and physical strain PERIOD It is putting yourself through pure physical torture to raise money for children you dont know PERIOD

For every Four Diamonds child I choose the  million PERIOD They benefit more than any greek or business PERIOD Not just from the money raised which pays all their medical bills but also from the experience of Thon and being surrounded by over  people who love and support them without knowing them PERIOD The next time you degrade such a charitable event please think of all the people who put time love and effort into its fulfillment PERIOD
