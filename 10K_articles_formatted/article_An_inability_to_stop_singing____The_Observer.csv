Ciara Hopkinson  Monday May  

My mom was surprised the first time I texted her on a Sunday afternoon telling her I would not be able to have our normal hourlong Sunday night phone conversation PERIOD I hadnt just lost my voice like your average person loses her voice I was actually unable to speak PERIOD I couldnt make a sound louder than the faintest wheeze PERIOD

What did you do to yourself she asked suspiciously when I called her the next afternoon recovered enough to rasp out a few words PERIOD

Nothing I squeaked as confused as she was PERIOD I have always lost my voice easily but this was a level I could honestly say I had never reached before PERIOD

By the third and fourth times that I woke up unable to talk however neither my mom nor I was thrown off PERIOD She had come to expect the text telling her that once again we would have to put off our weekly chat and I had finally figured out the cause my inability to stop singing PERIOD

Disclaimer Im a terrible singer PERIOD Every single one of my friends will testify to that fact PERIOD Every single one of my friends will also testify that I sing all the time PERIOD I cant stop myself no matter how far off the notes Im sure to be or how raspy my voice has become over the course of the day PERIOD Every time I hear a song I know an irresistible urge to sing along rises in me  a reality made worse by the unusual ease with which I memorize song lyrics I know a lot of songs PERIOD Im sure other people dont enjoy hearing me belt out Bridge Over Troubled Water but nothing makes me happier than feeling my lungs strain as I close my eyes throw my head back and pour my soul into the words PERIOD

A couple of weeks ago my older brother and I listened to the newest album from one of our favorite bands together PERIOD After a few songs my brother turned to me and said Doesnt it make you mad that some people cant just listen to music for its own sake I nodded in agreement and we didnt speak again until the album was over PERIOD I could not have been more content PERIOD Perhaps because I learn lyrics so easily listening to music demands the full investment of my mind body and soul PERIOD I suppose this means Im doomed to lose my voice on every solo car trip I take and every concert I attend for the rest of my life but its worth it to feel the song deep within me somehow a part of me and something much larger at once  a feeling I can only describe as pure joy PERIOD
