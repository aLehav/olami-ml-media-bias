In Super Bowl XLV the Green Bay Packers defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers  in a game that closely resembled a battle between a golden steel rod and an engorged meat patty from the hind parts of a steer reared by Vince Lombardi Himself PERIOD That is to say it was a good but not great game PERIOD

It was the Packers fourth Super Bowl victory and their first since Brett Favre retired from being good at football and after overcoming numerous obstacles over the course of the season it was clear that they deserved to be crowned as the best football team in America PERIOD In the brutal game of football it is often a teams relative attrition rather than their relative talent that determines success PERIOD This was not the case for the  Packers PERIOD They lost over  playerstarts this season to injuries PERIOD Starting linebackers Brandon Chillar and Nick Barnett starting tight end Jermichael Finley and starting tackle Mark Tauscher along with  other players all finished the season on the injured reserve and star quarterback Aaron Rodgers missed time due to concussions PERIOD Ultimately the Packers displayed incredible resilience and depth in the face of such an injury crisis but they certainly felt the impact of missing so many key players PERIOD The Packers finished  in their last seven regular season games to back into the last seed in the NFC PERIOD

In some respects having to play three road playoff games to reach the Super Bowl bolstered the Packers championship credentials PERIOD Beating the Eagles in Philadelphia walloping the Falcons in Atlanta and crushing the Jay Cutler Experience in Chicago sent a message that this team could meet and overcome almost any obstacle PERIOD The Week  loss to the Patriots was a harbinger of things to come despite Aaron Rodgers absence and facing the supposed cream of the NFL crop the Packers were one freak kick return by 300pound lineman Dan Connolly away from pulling out a victory in a game the experts expected would be a blowout PERIOD

And it wasnt just their resilience that impressed PERIOD The Packers were able to win games in a variety of ways PERIOD The Patriots of the past few years have had some tremendous regular season successes but it seems that they only have one type of game they can win PERIOD The Patriots have been great at building quick leads and then taking advantage of mistakes teams make while trying to come back but they cant seem to win those grindemout kickemintheknees facefullofmudandmanstink games that would have given Vince Lombardi a Vince Lombardi Trophy in his pants PERIOD I bring up the Patriots because I am familiar with them and they provide a good contrast with this years Packers team who were malleable yet hard like freshly smelted steel PERIOD

The Packers won a fairly sloppy lowscoring game in Philadelphia where they held the NFLs most vicious running dog Michael Vick to  rushing yards and forced a crucial interception on the Eagles final drive PERIOD The offense got its turn to have the spotlight in Atlanta where they seemed to drive at will on the Falcons and were still completing 20yard thirddown throws in the fourth quarter of a blowout PERIOD In a game that could have easily been confused for a high school matchup they beat the Bears in Chicago by making fewer mistakes and by having fewer Jay Cutlers PERIOD The AFC was supposedly the stronger conference this season and the Steelers were impressive throughout the regular season and the playoffs showing some resilience themselves by coming back from a  deficit to defeat the Ravens in the AFC Divisional Round PERIOD Yet the Packers entered the Super Bowl as favorites PERIOD This team just oozed a kind of quiet determination rather than the oozy determination that gets texted to massage therapists and Las Vegas recognized this PERIOD

The Super Bowl provided a sort of microcosm for the Packers season PERIOD They opened up a quick  lead over the most crucial six series of the game PERIOD Following an Aaron Rodgers touchdown throw Ben Roethlisberger forced an illadvised pass under pressure that led to a picksix for the Packers PERIOD On the following drive the Steelers got into the red zone only to stall and settle for a field goal to make it  PERIOD At this point it was clear to me that the Packers defensive game plan was to force Ben Roethlisberger to make throws he didnt want to make and corner him into small spaces PERIOD By halftime the Packers held a comfortable  lead PERIOD In the second half they had to suppress a Steelers charge that brought the game to within three points all while battling some crucial injuries having lost cornerback Charles Woodson to a shoulder injury and ageless receiver Donald Driver to a leg injury PERIOD The Packers were able to hold out for the  win in large part due to Roethlisbergers poor performance PERIOD

For Roethlisberger his Super Bowl showing was in line with his previous two Super Bowl games PERIOD His Super Bowl pergame averages  TD . iNT  yards  QB rating PERIOD The real problem for the Steelers was not their inability to stop Aaron Rodgers it was that their quarterback transforms into Rex Grossman when it comes to the Super Bowl PERIOD Part of me took joy in seeing Roethlisberger fold under the pressure but part of me also wanted to see a Ben Roethlisberger victory speech PERIOD The stock response athletes givethanking God family and God againwould have been replaced by Big Ben thanking his lawyers the Milledgeville District Attorneys Office and the principle of innocent until proven guilty PERIOD I am not too disappointed to have missed this though because I can now imagine him in a smoking jacket with a pipe explaining I dont always throw interceptions but when I do I prefer to throw them  in the Super Bowl. roethlisbergers flop stands in sharp contrast with the stellar effort of Aaron Rodgers whose performance solidified his position in the top tier of NFL quarterbacks with Peyton Manning and Tom Brady PERIOD Rodgers was mistakefree and calm throughout as he has been his whole career PERIOD It is fitting that in Rodgers the Packers have found a successor to Brett Favre who knows when to keep his gunslinger in his pants and when it is appropriate to whip out the fastball PERIOD Rodgers holds both the Cal and NFL career records for lowest interception rate and it was the Packers ability to avoid beating themselves that ultimately separated them from the Steelers and the rest of the NFL PERIOD
