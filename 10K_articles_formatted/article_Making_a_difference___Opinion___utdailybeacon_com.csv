Between noon and  p.m. the Knoxville Metropolitan Planning Commission

is holding a forum to discuss issues surrounding the Fort Sanders area PERIOD A

few of the scheduled topics will include land use building design

parking transportation and improvements PERIOD The theory is that by giving

residents in the area a chance to voice their opinions some suggestions

can be made as to what should be done to improve the area PERIOD The only problem

is apathy PERIOD Students are the first to complain about the noise at night or

the lack of lighting in the area but generally will be the last to speak

out in a forum that can make a difference PERIOD The MPC is giving residents

almost seven hours of time to fit most any schedule and are encouraging all

future and past residents to attend PERIOD Bring out your issues your concerns

and even your praise for the area you live in but most importantly come

out and make yourself heard PERIOD If you see the need for change take this

opportunity to meet the people who can make a difference PERIOD Remember it

takes only a spark to ignite the fire PERIOD
