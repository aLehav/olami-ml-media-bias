For graduate midfielder Mara Rodriguez it didnt happen overnight PERIOD

It all began with her mother a former collegiate soccer player teaching her the basics like learning how to walk with a ball at  years old PERIOD Rodriguez first played on a small hometown team her mother coached which sparked her love for the sport PERIOD

I obviously look up to her so much Rodriguez said PERIOD So having her introduce the sport to me set it apart from other sports I tried and grew that connection. rodriguez continued playing soccer throughout her childhood eventually verbally committing to West Virginia University WVU in eighth grade PERIOD While she wasnt set on a major she was drawn to WVUs soccer program which had just come off a deep NCAA Division I Womens Soccer Championship run in  PERIOD Rodriguez was so excited to join the team that she graduated high school half a year early to practice with the team in the spring before her freshman year PERIOD

When she arrived at WVU Rodriguez worked hard to get her feet settled and set some mini goals for herself as the youngest on the team in an intense environment PERIOD Even though she loved the program and the coaching environment Rodriguez realized she wanted to attend a school that was more challenging on the academic side PERIOD As a result she transferred to Providence College R.I. for her sophomore year PERIOD

I love the ocean I love the water so ultimately that led to my decision to go to Providence where academically it hit all my criteria Rodriguez said PERIOD Obviously it was still at a very very high level  being in the Big East Conference playing teams that go to the NCAA tournament every year  so I knew I was still going to be playing soccer at that highest level. rodriguez still has fond memories of her time at Providence College and developed close friendships with her teammates PERIOD

I absolutely loved it Rodriguez said PERIOD The girls are still all of my best friends  I still have some friends on the team that are in their senior year now so its crazy to watch them be seniors when they were freshmen when I knew them. over the course of her high school and collegiate careers the El Salvador womens national football team continued to recruit Rodriguez PERIOD It started when her club coach who knew she was a dual United States and El Salvador citizen called a scout from the national team to come observe some of her games while she was in high school PERIOD From there the team invited Rodriguez to their youth camp for the U15 U17 U19 and U20 levels PERIOD Rodriguez eventually made the senior level of the El Salvadoran national team roster in  despite tearing her anterior cruciate ligament ACL during her senior year at Providence College PERIOD

It was crazy because my first camp was my very first time back after tearing my ACL she said PERIOD And then my first game back was my first full national team game with the full team against Belize PERIOD So that was an incredible experience and Im so grateful that everything worked out as best as I could have imagined and prayed for. rodriguez represented El Salvador at the  CONCACAF Tournament Qualifiers where she scored three goals in a game against Belize PERIOD As one of the younger players on the roster Rodriguez said she was focusing on going in as humble as she could be PERIOD

If I played the U.S. i would have played Alex Morgan at the time or Carli Lloyd so it was pretty crazy Rodriguez said PERIOD I felt so privileged to be there PERIOD I was so grateful for the opportunity. after graduating from Providence College Rodriguez made her way to Emory University to pursue a masters degree at the Rollins School of Public Health PERIOD Because of her ACL injury and the COVID19 pandemic she still had two years of competition eligibility and explored different options for graduate school including Emory PERIOD

Rodriguez said that Emory checked both of those boxes in terms of its academic offerings and highlycompetitive soccer program PERIOD The location was also a plus for her with the warm weather being a welcome change from the Northeast PERIOD

A visit with Womens Soccer Head Coach Sue Patberg and an opportunity to work with Assistant Coach Catherine Whitehill helped Rodriguez make the decision to come to Emory PERIOD

She had other opportunities and other great schools that wanted her to go there and play Patberg said PERIOD We just happened to be incredibly fortunate to be on the receiving end of Mara joining us. rodriguez has had a great career so far at Emory starting in all  games in the  season winning a  AllUAA honorable mention and scoring a hat trick in an away game on Sept PERIOD   against Maryville College Tenn. PERIOD

She also played in all  games this season for Emory and is one of the teams captains PERIOD Patberg referred to Rodriguez as a strong leader. she never really gets panicked Patberg said PERIOD She doesnt get overly emotional or overly frustrated where it takes her out of her ability to perform PERIOD She really can stay engaged in the game. patberg added that Rodriguez is an encourager who helps her teammates to perform at their best. rodriguez dominates both ends of the field defensively and creates scoring chances for both herself and her teammates PERIOD Graduate forward Kylie Hall echoed Patbergs sentiments PERIOD

If you lose the ball shes the one to be like Its alright PERIOD Snap out of it which is a great leadership quality as well Hall said PERIOD I think shes just a great leader by example because shes always going to go . hall said she instantly became friends with Rodriguez because of her great qualities as a person PERIOD

I just fell in love with her personality on and off the field Hall said PERIOD Shes very humble PERIOD Shes really really selfless PERIOD She also is such a hard worker. rodriguez has superstitious pregame rituals that all her teammates make fun of her about PERIOD

I always go to Goldbergs Fine Foods before every game and get a bagel Rodriguez said PERIOD And then in the locker rooms I always put my right cleat on before my left and my right shin guards on before my left shin guards. thanks to Goldbergs Fine Foods  or rather her dedication and hard work  Rodriguez has had immense success in the realm of womens soccer at Emory and beyond PERIOD

Shes always making sure that everyones happy and that everyone feels confident Hall said PERIOD Shes an amazing leader and teammate. jack Rutherford 27C is from Louisville Kentucky majoring in Economics on a prelaw track PERIOD When not writing or photographing for the Wheel he can normally be found with the Emory Rowing team or at an Econ department guest lecture PERIOD In his free time Rutherford enjoys listening to classical music or opera or is out walking in Lullwater PERIOD
