Pink cigarettes would clear the air of debonair

TODD BRAUCH is a freshman neweditorial major and a Daily Nebraskan columnist PERIOD

Recently the State of Florida along with  other states filed lawsuit against the tobacco companies of America for a mere . billion PERIOD Their mission To recover money spent treating smokers PERIOD

I may be wrong but I always thought cigarettes were bad PERIOD I didnt need a Surgeon Generals warning or an antismoking campaign to tell me  are unhealthy PERIOD It was just common knowledge such as fire is hot moms are always annoying and you never find the shirt you really like in your size PERIOD

Some of the trials that are being waged against cigarette pushers claim that the smoker or selfportrayed victim never had any clue that smoking  packs a day for  years could do any harm PERIOD You would think that the morning ritual of hacking up chunks of phlegm the size of cue balls would be some sort of hint PERIOD

This is something my best friend does every morning evening and sometimes just for fun yet he knows if he doesnt quit he will die PERIOD A fact he readily admits while smoking PERIOD Its his fault he started so he has to end it PERIOD Although it would be amazing to see how his lung lining resembles the pot holes on a New York street PERIOD

The real way to get people to quit smoking is not by telling them that they are going to die PERIOD Wheres the fun in that You must take a radical approach something that has never been tried or even considered PERIOD I have developed that plan PERIOD I call it 

Most people start smoking because it looks cool PERIOD Theres something about a person standing by a fence post wind blowing the delicate strands of their hair PERIOD They glance around and take a couple puffs of a cig PERIOD Just calm and cool PERIOD It looks damn good PERIOD

Imagine that same scenario but the cigarette is not a common cigarette it just happens to be PINK PERIOD It just doesnt look right PERIOD It kind of makes the stud smokemodel look like a sissy PERIOD If you take the glamour out of smoking it would not be as popular PERIOD

Operation Bunny Slippers runs like this

The government mandates all cigarettes sold in America to be pink PERIOD All cigarette names would have to be changed to fit the cigarette PERIOD Marlboro would be Bunny Tails PERIOD Camel would be Chickies all other names would be

converted to all those cute little elements that make Easter so nauseating PERIOD Advertising would be the same and as vigorous as it is now PERIOD

In turn the government and states back off the thousands of lawsuits theyre trying against the tobacco companies PERIOD

In theory smokers would be irritated and wouldnt want to be caught smoking something pink PERIOD Although the deprivation may cause them to become extremely agitated and go on a killing spree PERIOD I would probably be the first victim PERIOD Hmm .. PERIOD Maybe this is not a great idea PERIOD Its bad PERIOD Totally wrong do not even read this PERIOD Cigarettes should be less expensive PERIOD There should be smoking in all restaurants and public buildings PERIOD

Personally I dont care who smokes and who doesnt I just dont want to see my tax money spent fighting frivolous lawsuits PERIOD The money should be used here at home filling potholes PERIOD Just wait until winter the asphalt magically transforms into Swiss cheese PERIOD
