After four years of hard work and lectures many college students are finding that their biggest test is finding a job after graduation PERIOD

The current job market has limited the opportunities of internships and fulltime jobs that once lay in front of matriculating seniors. according to CBS News only one in five college graduates in  left school having a job compared to one in two graduates with jobs in  PERIOD

The New York Times reported similar statistics from the Economic Policy Institute stating that the unemployment rate for college graduates under the age of  has increased to . percent almost double the rate in  PERIOD

These national statistics are hitting close to home for students at Mary Washington PERIOD

A lot of the jobs that would normally go to college graduates are being given to experienced middleaged people who have lost their jobs class of  graduate Quela Carlson said PERIOD They are fighting just as hard as we are for entrylevel jobs. i am positive the qualifications for simpler jobs have been getting stricter and tougher because employers are realizing people are more desperate to be employed  graduate Julia Munzert said. i have seen several secretarial jobsnot even corporate assistants or anythingthat have required Ph.D.s. however many faculty members are citing the benefits of unpaid alternatives PERIOD

The ideal situation would be having an internship prior to graduation Director of Career Services Gary Johnson said PERIOD

Johnson explained that this increases the students marketability to all employers while improving their resume as well as building connections with potential employers even if they dont stay with the same company PERIOD

I would recommend that students pursue internships or consider training programs or workshops to learn specific skills or earn certifications Brooke Donaldson assistant professor of French said PERIOD As part of the government stimulus program the Workforce Investment Board and many companies have received money to provide such services. despite the challenging job market many employers are still recruiting on campus with events like last Thursdays Career Fair sponsored by the Office of Career Services. over  employers sent representatives to the Great Hall where they were able to answer questions network and find potential hires PERIOD

However these employers are not able to hire as many students as they were in previous years. lauren Andrews a human resources representative from an accounting firm in Richmond said the firm was only offering five positions this year as opposed to  last year PERIOD

Our current interns are getting the job offers she said PERIOD The students arent getting as many offers as usual. andrews graduated from UMW in  with a bachelors degree in English and said she knows how hard it is to find a job in todays economy. she said within their firm the positions are very competitive and the desired GPA has increased tremendously PERIOD

Focus on extracurriculars and try to get as much experience under your belt as possible she advised PERIOD

However not all companies saw a decrease in the amount of people they were able to hire. all of the governmentaffiliated businesses are remaining consistent PERIOD

Stick with the governmentwere stable said Amanda MacDonald an auditor with the US Department of Education PERIOD

MacDonald went on to explain that the Recovery and Reinvestment Act an economic stimulus bill enacted in February has greatly helped the permanence of government jobs PERIOD

Johnson said that the government was hiring significant numbers of people and the jobs were very competitive. several students are also looking further into the alternative of graduate school. at George Washington University in Washington DC the studentrun newspaper the Hatchet reported in January that graduate applications were up  percent in the past year PERIOD

Similarly Duke University reportedly had a  percent increase in graduate applications according to USNews.com PERIOD

I am deciding if I will be going to graduate school and working or just working which will affect what kind of job I pursue after graduation Margaux DeLong a UMW senior said PERIOD

Donaldson made this observation as well PERIOD

Rather than choosing graduate school as an alternative more students are resigning themselves to the fact that they may well have to start with a temporary or lessthanideal job before settling into something more permanent andor desirable Donaldson said PERIOD

While the job market may be thin right now employers and faculty encourage students to keep trying no matter what setbacks they may face PERIOD

Be open to all jobs consider all possibilities Johnson advised PERIOD Youll have the best luck with some flexibility. he said that he hopes the class of  will not face difficulties in finding employment to the same degree as the class of  as they are beginning to see more job listings and more requests from employers to be listed PERIOD

Hopefully for this graduating class the job market will continue to improve he said PERIOD

Be patient and persistent and dont be discouraged Donaldson said you are certainly not alone.",Graduates Strike Out in Job Search â€“ The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
