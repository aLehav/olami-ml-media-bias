9461,1970-01-01,"emerging from the preseason tournament portion of their schedule Drexel Universitys softball team had certainly shown flashes of potential PERIOD An undefeated albeit abbreviated Lady Pirate Classic was followed up with a  performance at the rebel games which had its highs such as the  triumph over Hampton but also its lows a  loss to Bucknell capped off the Orlando trip PERIOD

This same seesaw trend of inconsistency continued to play out in the early portion of season play PERIOD A strong  start with wins over Norfolk State and North Carolina Central the latter via a  mercy rule was counterbalanced by a string of four consecutive losses at the hands of UNC Greensboro Elon and City Six rival Villanova PERIOD

With that in mind entering last Wednesdays double header with Lafayette the script of this season was still very much unwritten PERIOD The stretch of five games in five days provided Drexel a perfect opportunity to establish a strong rhythm entering Colonial Athletic Association play PERIOD

In the first leg the bats simply didnt come alive for the Dragons who were unable to score a single run after Kristi Uyesakas first inning RBI single spoiling an otherwise strong start by Taylor Lee PERIOD The immediate turnaround of the doubleheader format left no time for dwelling on disappointment PERIOD

The two teams appeared to be evenly matched and continued to play like it in the second game which quickly turned into a pitchers duel between the Leopards Lindsey Cherry and the Drexels Tara Konopka PERIOD

After  innings of clean sheets for both pitchers Drexel finally broke through in the bottom of the fourth with an  run outburst PERIOD A string of RBI singles by Drexels  hitters in the lineup blew the game wide open and Konopkas stifling performance promptly shut the door on a comeback in the following frame cementing the muchneeded victory PERIOD

Drexels potent offensive production as has seemingly been the case for much of the year was unable to carry through to the rest of the weeks games PERIOD In two games against Delaware on Saturday the lineup was able to produce just  runs PERIOD

In the first game each portion of offensive production was bettered by Delaware in their half of the inning ultimately ending in a  defeat PERIOD The second game was not much different offensively PERIOD By the time that the Dragons scored a run in the top of the third inning Delaware had already jumped ahead to an  advantage PERIOD A  victory completed the sweep for the home Hens leaving Drexel searching for answers at the plate PERIOD

The two teams met again just a day later to finish up the inconference series and this time the mutual familiarity payed off in a lot of players from both teams crossing the plate PERIOD Drexel opened the festivities with a Kai Uyesaka RBI double but Delaware was able to absorb this early punch and deliver a decisive blow of their own tagging starter Tara Konopka with a  run opening inning PERIOD

Drexel would not go away quietly though this time PERIOD Paula Uenos  RBI triple highlighted a  run fifth and Kai Uyesakas single just an inning later tied up the ballgame at  PERIOD After pulling ahead  by the end of the fifth it appeared that the Dragons were poised to end the weekend on a high note PERIOD

Unfortunately the Hens did not have the same feeling PERIOD After a crushing  run Delaware outburst in the bottom of the sixth inning the Dragons simply didnt have enough firepower to respond PERIOD A disappointing  defeat drove home the theme of the week  not enough consistency in either stage of the game PERIOD

That said the Dragons did have a consolation prize for the weeks performances PERIOD On April  the CAA announced that Drexels senior Paula Ueno was named coplayer of the week PERIOD The senior shortstop did her best to will her side to victory hitting a staggering . from the plate including  perfect  showings against Delaware PERIOD

Uenos performance last week was a continuation of her hot streak this season in which she has driven in  runs while maintaining a pristine . average PERIOD If the Dragons are to break their current slump its fair to say they have just the player who can lead the way PERIOD","Softball triumphs against Hampton, falls against Bucknell - The Triangle",Drexel University
