2212,2022-03-16,"firstyear students elected four Student Government representatives to the College Council on Friday PERIOD The winning candidates were Michael Meng with  votes Asya Aka with  votes David Shapiro with  votes and Preethi Raju with  votes PERIOD A total of  candidates were on the ballot this year PERIOD

Voter turnout was at about  percent which is fairly normal for a fall election according to College Council Interim Chairperson Mike Viola PERIOD Viola said he was surprised by the aspirational nature of the candidates pitches PERIOD

Candidate platforms were particularly ambitious this year to the point that I was worried the candidates may not be able to realize such plans in one year or that they were focusing too much on politicized issues that may be inappropriate for Student Government to get involved with he wrote in an email PERIOD That being said I was very glad to see that candidates found a wide range of student life matters that they wished to improve and that they made rather substantial efforts to speak with their constituencies. many candidates focused their platforms on campus living issues PERIOD Popular ideas included subsidized public transport and the use of Maroon Dollars for printing and laundry PERIOD However due to the multitude of candidates and unfamiliar electorate Meng said that achieving name recognition through posters and social media might have been more important than a unique platform PERIOD

I dont think that any one of the candidates that were running could claim something that was uniquely theirsthat others couldnt promise Meng said PERIOD

The similarities between platforms according to Meng were the result of how long firstyears have been on campus and the issues theyve encountered in the past three weeks PERIOD

Raju said she formed her platform through Facebook polls and student interviews revealing concerns about transportation dining and communication with school officials PERIOD However she said some students questioned whether firstyear representatives would be able to implement these goals PERIOD

My response was I mean Im not promising I can get any of this stuff done but Im definitely going to advocate what the students want and to solve the students needs Raju said PERIOD So Im going to do my best. part of the reason for the criticism of similar candidate platforms Shapiro said is a lack of clarity on the role of SG among firstyear students clarity which he gained by talking to older students already involved in SG PERIOD

Its pretty complex he said PERIOD For the vast majority of candidates and the general student population I think it is pretty difficult to determine what exactly their elected representatives do. however Aka said while firstyear candidates dont have much experience on campus criticizing them for putting forth big ideas is unfair PERIOD I dont think theres any harm going into this position with optimism and enthusiasm and goals that we want to achieve she said PERIOD

SG president Tyler Kissinger said that there are inherent problems in a fall election such as firstyears lack of familiarity with the campus and student government PERIOD This year Kissinger said he does anticipate SG action on aspects of campus life brought up during the election such as UPass PERIOD He also expects to form committees on dining and transportation and other collegecentric issues PERIOD
