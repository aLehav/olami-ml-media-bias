On December  Urban Meyer announced that he would retire as head football coach for the Ohio State Buckeyes at age  with offensive coordinator Ryan Day taking over after the Rose Bowl game against Washington on New Years Day PERIOD While Meyer has faced ongoing health problems for years and was rightfully criticized for his recent handling of former assistant coach Zach Smiths domestic violence problems his accomplishments set him apart as one of the greatest college football coaches of this era PERIOD

Before Meyer joined Ohio State in  he had already established himself as one of the best coaches in college football PERIOD Making careerstops at Bowling Green Utah and Florida he amassed a record of  PERIOD In his final season at Utah in  he led an undefeated season and quarterback Alex Smith was selected first overall in the  NFL Draft PERIOD

Meyers sixyear run at Florida is remembered for the  and  national championships led by  Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow PERIOD

Meyer came to Ohio State in  amidst a difficult situation in the football program PERIOD The team was facing a postseason ban after some of its players sold memorabilia in exchange for tattoos PERIOD

He quickly made fans forget about the scandal by winning the first  games and then leading Ohio State all the way to the top of the college football world in  beating Oregon to win the first College Football Playoff National Championship PERIOD

Meyer led Ohio State to three Big Ten championships and made the College Football Playoff a second time in  PERIOD Under Meyer Ohio State won at least 12games every season except one during which they won  and never lost more than two games in a season PERIOD

Most importantly Ohio State never lost to its rival Michigan under Meyer PERIOD His current record at Ohio State is  and his winning percentage is a remarkable . marking him among the greatest college coaches ever PERIOD

Meyers health problems date back to  and have gotten worse in recent years PERIOD His first scare came after the  SEC Championship Game when he woke up with chest pains and went to the hospital PERIOD He had surgery on a cyst in his brain in  to prevent headaches but his headaches have reappeared over the past two seasons PERIOD

These health problems in combination with the threegame suspension Meyer served because of how he handled domestic abuse allegations against Smith made this season one of Meyers most challenging PERIOD

During the investigation of Smith which lasted most of August Meyer was placed on paid leave and could not be in contact with the team PERIOD

Due to the cyst in his brain Meyer often dealt with severe headaches during games PERIOD In the October  game against Indiana Meyer fell to the ground and Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith told Meyer he would need to remove him from the sidelines if that were to happen again PERIOD

I was worried that I was going to have to speak at my friends funeral former Buckeye Cris Carter said on Fox Sports 1s First Things First. with all of the adversity Meyer has faced this season and his ongoing health problems that the stress of coaching exacerbates retirement was the only rational decision he could make PERIOD

While some fans will remember Meyer as a legendary coach and others for how he handled allegations against Smith there is no doubt that his most important achievement is the impact he had on the countless young men he coached PERIOD

In his retirement press conference when asked about what he would miss most about coaching Meyer asserted that the players were the obvious choice PERIOD Former and current Buckeyes were equally as appreciative of Meyer PERIOD Many reflected on Twitter PERIOD

I shed a tear every timethinking about the impact you had on my life and manyother individuals PERIOD You provided tools for success  National Champion under Meyer and New Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas said PERIOD

Nothing but love for this man righthere PERIOD Couldnt thank him enough for what hes done for me and my family Buckeye punter Drue Chrisman said PERIOD

Meyer will go down as one of the all time great college coaches because of his unparalleled achievements on the field and the impact he has had on numerous lives PERIOD
