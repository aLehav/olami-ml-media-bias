Dear UMB Community

I could only fit six people here at once PERIOD It is almost impossible to have more than one conversation at a time PERIOD There are over  veterans now on campus and on a weekly basis over  vets come through the centerto relax play chess or cards or use the computers PERIOD It is difficult for them to relax with the limited space they have PERIOD

The number one thing for the center is to have a space where vets can talk to other vets and engage in peer counseling PERIOD There is not enough space to discuss sensitive issues in such an open area PERIOD As it is now the Veterans Center is in an unsecured space PERIOD They cant discuss classified or emotional information here PERIOD

Vets cant come here and comfortably do homework PERIOD Most vets are used to activity going on around them PERIOD They are used to highenergy areas that have more activity thats why vets cant just go to the library PERIOD The Vets Center is supposed to be a happy medium PERIOD Thats what the Vet Center is for PERIOD

There are many events coordinated out of the Center PERIOD The Center is very important because this should be a place to convene PERIOD I am putting together Monday Night Football viewings and I will be working with the Veterans Homeless Center off the Government Center T stop PERIOD We are going to help feed the homeless veterans for Thanksgiving PERIOD

We will commemorate November  for Vietnam Veterans Day and remember the soldiers of the one hundred and third Infantry who were overrun by the VC PERIOD

There is also an art expo starting where UMB veterans painting drawings and digital art can be showcased PERIOD UMass Boston vets can come together here to express themselves PERIOD The deadline is October  for submissions PERIOD

UMB vets discuss strong topics amongst themselves PERIOD Our vets have said its the Veterans Center is not big enough or private enough. here they have to watch what they say and be careful not to say the wrong thing to offend someone PERIOD

It would makes sense to have all the veterans campus services like the Upward Bound the Jointer Center for the Study of War and Social Consequences the campus Veterans Affairs Representative and the Veterans Center in one place PERIOD I dont think the veterans services should be so far away from one another PERIOD It would be more beneficial to vets if it were in one place PERIOD

There have been spaces on campus in the past where vets can congregate PERIOD This will be a memorable place that vets will miss when they graduate PERIOD

The idea is to have a space where veterans can freely express themselves when things become overwhelming PERIOD Space is a rare commodity but is something Im working towards for veterans because they deserve that PERIOD

We have the largest amount of veterans for a state school in Massachusetts PERIOD This group is under expressed in a vet friendly university PERIOD Basic needs including a Center where vets are secure enough to feel safe doesnt exist here PERIOD

The UMB community needs to show the veterans at UMB they care by saying thank you PERIOD The administration should accept smart credits for training courses we take PERIOD I dont know what it would take to get a Military Science ROTC program started here but it is worth looking into PERIOD

The disabled vets have things in common with the disabled students on campus but the vets need their own space to speak freely PERIOD Though putting them conjointly next to one another would make sense PERIOD

We need a space where  students can safely meet with elbowroom to boot PERIOD We need to offer a center where vets look forward to coming to to decompress or relax PERIOD I want a center bigger than an office where they feel welcome to come PERIOD Right now it feels like an office not a center PERIOD We have to hurryupand wait for the new GI Bill or hurryupand wait for a new center PERIOD

Some vets coming from active duty need some adjustment care PERIOD I want to make sure the veterans on campus are getting the services they need PERIOD They need to know they can come to me and I will be their advocate PERIOD Thats what I am here for PERIOD I also make events for vets happen PERIOD

I am putting together a trip to Washington D.C PERIOD for the veterans as well April  PERIOD Interested vets should contact me PERIOD There is an invitation to the White House for a tour for  veterans PERIOD We will also go to the Arlington cemetery Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Women veterans museum and the Vietnam veterans wall PERIOD

If anybody wants to get involved or has any questions or comments they can reach me at emailprotected

Sincerely

Caroline Necheles
