Entering the season the field hockey team brought six fresh starters two new coaches and a new defensive scheme onto the field PERIOD And Penn State still expected to improve on its Final Four performance from a year ago PERIOD

Dont look now but the Lady Lions are halfway there PERIOD

With  out of  games under its belt Penn State has just one blemish on its record  as the team did last season at this juncture PERIOD It holds the No PERIOD  ranking in the country and shows no signs of stopping with that PERIOD

While the Lady Lions continue to devour opponents without taking time out to chew they have already answered the most pressing question on Coach Charlene Moretts mind PERIOD

 Morett said PERIOD 

If Penn State continues to do what it did in the first half of the season the team could very well improve upon its present standing PERIOD

The Lady Lions have maintained a potent offensive attack despite losing Kristen Winters now a volunteer assistant Chelle Frates and Lynette Kidder from the arsenal PERIOD

Penn State averages four goals per game and holds a  advantage over its opponent in shotsongoal PERIOD

 Morett said PERIOD I think thats why weve been so successful  once we have the ball we do a good job of possessing the ball and also putting it into scoring position.Im not surprised by Christines success because when I saw her in high school she was a natural scorerAnd she learned a lot last year without really having the pressure to perform.I think with the new coaching  that helped us a lot on defense because Megan Donnelly and Theresa DeGirolamo are both defensive coachesThe people who had a taste of it last year know what its like to get to be in the final four and were carrying that this year Stewart said PERIOD
