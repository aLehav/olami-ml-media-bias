One of the arguments in favor of organic farming is that its more environmentally sustainable PERIOD

However a review published in Nature suggests as with many issues in the environmental world things may not be so black and white PERIOD The review determined that crop yields from organic farming were significantly lower than those from more conventional farming methods PERIOD While yields are only one metric in a sea of many one of the major environmental issues that we face is one of not only overpopulation but that of the finite amount of land we have to grow food on to support that population PERIOD

Still the authors of the study insist that this isnt an excuse to throw away organic farming methods PERIOD Instead we should be combining the good practices of both organic and traditional methods to make a more sustainable hybrid PERIOD

Light Weight Big Muscles

Common wisdom has suggested that the best way to bulk up at the gym is to lift fewer sets of heavy weights however a new study suggests that that may not be the case PERIOD In the Journal of Applied Physiology a report came to the conclusion that for young men though heavier weights may increase strength they dont add to any increase in muscle volume over lifting more reps of lighter weights assuming in both cases that the lifter works himself to exhaustion PERIOD This can provide an equivalent workout with a much lower chance of injury PERIOD

Your Faith Was Strong But You Needed Proof

A study published in Science suggests that subjects will report weaker religious beliefs if put into a more analytical mindset PERIOD The experiment using techniques such as asking their volunteers to look at Rodins statue The Thinker or read a questionnaire in a less legible font which have both been tested in the past to promote more reasonbased thinking reported that religious thinking was linked to more intuitive processes PERIOD The authors insist however that the results dont mean to suggest that religion is irrational PERIOD

Instead they think that spiritual beliefs are more linked to intrinsic feelings than analytical reasoning PERIOD

White Powder Leads to Loss of Grey Matter

Few people think that cocaine use is a smart habit to pick up regardless of how old you are but a study published in Molecular Psychiatry suggests that it can also make your brain age faster PERIOD MRIs of habitual cocaine users were compared to those of a control group and revealed that though brain size decreased with age for both groups it did so almost twice as fast for those who used the drug PERIOD

Miracle Glass

Glass is one of those wondermaterials with a multitude of uses though its not without its flaws PERIOD However a method for creating textures on the surfaces developed at MIT corrects several of the big ones PERIOD Thanks to the new design the glass is selfcleaning in addition to being fog and glareresistant PERIOD Aside from the obvious uses such as corrective lenses and smart phones this could provide a huge boost in the durability longevity and efficiency of solar panels which quickly become dirty blocking out potential sunlight and often lose energy by reflecting light PERIOD The most remarkable thing about the new glass is that the process to create it is simple and could be applied at a minimal cost to devices in the near future PERIOD
