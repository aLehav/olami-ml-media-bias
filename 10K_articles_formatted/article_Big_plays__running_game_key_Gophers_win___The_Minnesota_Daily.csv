It took six minutes PERIOD Six minutes to go from uh oh to oh yes. six minutes to turn a 10point deficit to a 4point lead PERIOD Six minutes to begin a two quarter stretch during which the Gophers would outscore Purdue   PERIOD The run was more than enough for Minnesota to win its first homecoming game since  and the inaugural homecoming at TCF Bank Stadium  PERIOD A frigid Saturday that began shakily finished in exactly the fashion the Gophers needed with backtoback games at Penn State and Ohio State looming PERIOD It was huge especially with our next two road games senior linebacker Lee Campbell said about the significance of bouncing back from last weeks 3point loss at home to Wisconsin PERIOD Huge but not always pretty especially early PERIOD Minnesotas first offensive drive stalled quickly PERIOD On a thirdand3 and the fourth play from scrimmage junior quarterback Adam Weber missed an open Troy Stoudermire and the Gophers punted away PERIOD Purdue drove down for a 43yard field goal PERIOD On the first play of Minnesotas next possession Weber overthrew tight end Nick TowArnett PERIOD The pass was intercepted by Torri Williams PERIOD This time the Boilermakers turned it into  points and a  lead PERIOD Weber never got much better PERIOD He attempted just nine passes PERIOD Two were intercepted PERIOD He completed five for  yards the longest a 47yard strike to senior wide receiver Eric Decker that put the Gophers on the 1yard line and in position for their first score of the game PERIOD By his standards Deckers day was below average as well PERIOD He caught three passes for  yards PERIOD Im going to be very frustrated with myself Weber said about how he will react when he reviews tape PERIOD Offensive coordinator Jedd Fisch was giving our offense an opportunity to make some big plays and I just wasnt able to execute. most days as Weber and Decker go so goes the offense PERIOD On this day however Minnesota rushed for  yards  its highest total in two years PERIOD Redshirt freshman Kevin Whaley rushed for  yards and his first career touchdown averaging nearly  yards per carry in the process  PERIOD For only the fourth time in head coach Tim Brewsters tenure the ground game outgained the passing game PERIOD Regularly working from short fields the Gophers for once did not need to rely on the dynamic WeberDecker duo PERIOD Instead Minnesota relied on defensive and special team turnovers that set up easy scoring opportunities PERIOD Three touchdown drives started inside Purdues 35yard line  PERIOD In the second quarter just four plays after the Gophers trimmed Purdues lead to  quarterback Joey Elliott tried to dump the ball to running back Ralph Bolden near the line of scrimmage but Campbell stepped into the passing lane PERIOD The middle linebacker returned the interception  yards to the Boilermakers 2yard line setting up an easy score PERIOD Campbell played a supporting role in  of Minnesotas  third quarter points as well PERIOD He blocked a 38yard field goal attempt by Purdues Carson Wiggs PERIOD The ball caromed across midfield and senior cornerback Traye Simmons tracked it down and ran  yards for Minnesotas first blocked field goal return for a touchdown since Oct PERIOD   PERIOD The penetration was so good that Campbell said the ball hit him in the helmet which explains why the ball ended up so far downfield before Simmons scooped it up PERIOD Add  tackles to the interception and blocked field goal and Campbell had quite a day PERIOD When you think about all the good football teams that youve seen through the years you see a defense thats led by a fiery middle linebacker Brewster said PERIOD And our guy is a fiery middle linebacker PERIOD He may not be the most talented guy in the world but Ill tell you what he gives you his heart on every snap. special teams both actively and passively set up two more quick scores PERIOD Minnesotas first score of the second half was a 2yard rush by Weber set up by a shanked 7yard punt and a 28yard scamper by Whaley  PERIOD And on the ensuing kickoff redshirt freshman linebacker Keanon Cooper forced a fumble that was smothered by sophomore Bryan Klitzke PERIOD Five plays later the Gophers were in the end zone again PERIOD For most of the second half Cooper relieved senior Nate Triplett who reaggravated a shoulder injury suffered a week ago against Wisconsin of outside linebacker PERIOD He recorded  tackles and a sack  PERIOD Tripletts having an AllBig Ten possibly AllAmerican season Cooper said PERIOD The better I play the more he gets to stay out and rest so Im just maximizing my role. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
