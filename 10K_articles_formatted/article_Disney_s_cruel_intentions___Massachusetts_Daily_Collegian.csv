It was the shot heard round the world a shot that came from the gun of a stealthy hunter into the body of an unsuspecting bystander PERIOD By now I assume everyone knows this story very well and if youre anything like me you strongly empathized with the parties affected by this violent act PERIOD From the minute the bullet was fired my heart stopped and fifteen years later I can still recall the sinking feeling in my stomach and remember the trauma that followed PERIOD All I could think was poor Bambi PERIOD Our generation grew up in the prePixar classical Disney movie era PERIOD  Bambi Cinderella Lady and the Tramp The Lion King Old Yeller and many others were all such staples of childhood PERIOD These movies are timeless and are loved by people of all ages and backgrounds PERIOD However did you ever stop to wonder why they are so beloved If you examine all of these movies you will find that they all have one similar quality PERIOD They bring you down to lift you up PERIOD Every movie is a cleverly crafted emotional rollercoaster PERIOD And the people crafting these touching films have the same intentions as the theme park ride engineers working in Disney World making money PERIOD The release of Bambi II made me think back to being a five year old sitting in my living room engrossed in the happygolucky adventures of Bambi Thumper and Flower frolicking around the forest PERIOD Disney starts off every ride by making you feel euphoric and content with musical numbers and comedic story lines PERIOD And then just as you start to feel all warm and fuzzy inside BANG PERIOD The mom gets shot PERIOD The dad dies trying to save his son PERIOD  Someone gets kidnapped PERIOD Or a boy is forced to shoot his adored dog PERIOD Even though the endings are always heartwarming and full of virtue the downward emotional catapult scars PERIOD After watching Bambi I carried around a picture of my mom for all of kindergarten and over the years I have come to see that most people have some type of emotional baggage from Disney movies PERIOD Luckily for Disney that baggage translates into a lifelong customer PERIOD Watching these movies feels just like riding Space Mountain or seeing Cinderellas Castle for the first time PERIOD They all create a sense of magical enchantment PERIOD That enchantment is something that captivates children and keeps adults loyal always yearning for the nostalgia PERIOD Disney has perfected the capitalization of sentiment and that is how they have become an empire  a powerful money hungry empire with the sweetest facade youll ever see PERIOD I wont deny that I love all these movies PERIOD I actually think it is next to impossible not to love them PERIOD But is it necessary for them to be as traumatizing as they are Is it good or bad that Disney introduces children to such tragic and intense feelings And if you accept the fact that they are purposely toying with your emotions to brand you does it take away from the magic It would be naive to think that a huge corporation even Disney is not out to make money and this truth is not necessarily wrong or evil PERIOD Yet it does take away some of the magic for me PERIOD Its like finding out the person playing Mickey Mouse is a 22yearold girl or waking up to see your mom slip a  bill underneath your pillow PERIOD Our whole life we slowly become increasingly disillusioned and whether its coping with the death of Bambis mom or trying to understand the ills of capitalism its all really the same thing PERIOD Aside from the intentions behind the emotionally distressing Disney movie moments I wonder what are the effects Are these movies bursting our bubbles too early or are they a rite of passage like chicken pox once was Perhaps they make us better stronger and more emotionally capable human beings PERIOD Maybe I should be glad Bambis mom died PERIOD It was a daunting feeling but it sure made me appreciate my mom more PERIOD In that light I guess that Disney is on a par with peoples therapists PERIOD After all both make us laugh make us cry and get a hell of a lot of our money PERIOD Money takes the magic out of just about everything yet it never fails to put a glimmer in the eyes of those receiving it PERIOD I know its just how the machine works but it is sad that these great movies would never have been made if there werent predictions of large profits PERIOD While I cant quite decide if Disney is deserving of my lifelong support I think kids do deserve the experience because everyone needs to have a time in their life when the death of a cartoon deer seems like the absolute worst thing that could happen PERIOD Debbie Friedman is a Collegian columnist PERIOD
