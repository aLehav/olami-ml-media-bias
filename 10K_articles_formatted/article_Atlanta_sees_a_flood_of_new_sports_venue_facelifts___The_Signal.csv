8827,2023-11-05,"atlanta has emerged as a king in sports development PERIOD Considering the new and renovated venues that have popped up every other year the capital of the South is excelling at bringing itself the national sports spotlight PERIOD

Atlantas sports scene is in an excellent space right nowseveral teams are presently capable of competing for a championship and a few more will be able to in the coming years PERIOD And of course when our teams are playing at such an elite level they require topnotch homes PERIOD

Philips Arena the home of the Atlanta Hawks since  will have a new look this coming season PERIOD On Aug PERIOD  the Hawks announced a naming rights agreement with State Farm unveiling the renovated venue as State Farm Arena PERIOD It will certainly take some time for people to get used to saying State Farm instead of Philips but the deal will last for at least the next  seasons PERIOD

I think it speaks to the potential of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said PERIOD We have such a significant imprint in the sports industry and as an entertainment center to have a company like State Farm which is very protective of its brand PERIOD To attach its name to the Hawks and to attach its name to the city of Atlanta speaks to the respected regard that our city has across the world quite frankly PERIOD

Im very excited to celebrate with the Hawks and State Farm PERIOD Im looking forward to all that will happen in and outside the arena with this partnership Bottoms said PERIOD

A new name isnt the only change coming to the arena the Hawks have sought to upgrade their home and bring a new twist to the game experience PERIOD Beginning this season there will be two Top Golf simulators in the arena along with a lounge equipped with televisions for casual viewing of the game PERIOD

Fans will be able to get a haircut at The Swag Shop owned by Atlanta rapper Killer Mike PERIOD The Zac Browns Social Club will also bring a southern food flair to the arena PERIOD

Going to an arena all of my life I look forward to food and beverage as an experience not as a disaster risking my life hoping that I can survive the evening Hawks owner Tony Ressler said PERIOD Our food and beverage are going to change dramatically where people will be excited to eat and drink here. renovations will also be made to lower bowl seating by adding more suites and new electronics will seek to improve the viewer experience PERIOD

The scoreboard and the whole digital experience is going to put us into the twenty-first century that I promise Ressler said PERIOD And the whole concept of having a series of boxes on one side with fancy seats and no boxes or no fancy seats on the other has been eliminated PERIOD And that somewhat offended me from the beginning from the moment that I walked into the arena. the Erie Bayhawks is the Gatorade League affiliate of the Hawks PERIOD The team currently plays in Erie Pennsylvania which is roughly  hours away from Atlanta PERIOD That is set to change soon as the team is slated to get a new facility in College Park just  minutes away from State Farm Arena PERIOD

NBA teams are now trying to use their G League system as a sort of minor league and having a team so close will give the Hawks the ability to work with developing players much more PERIOD The Hawks coaching staff will be able to work more closely with its G League roster in hopes that it will lead to those players playing a role in the Hawks future PERIOD

Its another phase every team has a G League affiliate we have one thats now in Erie but its transitioning to College Park next year head coach Lloyd Pierce said PERIOD Proximity helps out a ton we can send players and coaches and our front office can go back and forth so the better were aligned the better our chances are of just growing and developing together. the Gateway Center will not only be home to the BayHawks but it will also host concerts and other events PERIOD G League games will host around  people while other events will host around  PERIOD Not only will this benefit the Hawks but it will improve College Park and its surrounding community PERIOD

Along with these renovations Georgia Tech just renovated Bobby Dodd Stadiums locker room PERIOD The Yellow Jackets spent . million dollars on the new additions in large part to keep up with the Jones in college football recruiting PERIOD

Each locker now has a 15inch screen that will be used as a nameplate and highlight display PERIOD Additionally there are large screen televisions slushie machines a hot tub and a cold tub PERIOD

Two brand new venues popped up within the past two seasons the MercedesBenz Stadium and SunTrust Park PERIOD While SunTrust Park isnt in the heart of Atlanta its now home to the Braves who are fighting for a playoff spot and may very well host a playoff game or series soon PERIOD

MercedesBenz Stadium is home to the Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United FC and both teams have recently played for championships PERIOD Atlanta United are in just their second season and have one of the best teams in the MLS PERIOD Super Bowl LIII will be played here in Atlanta in February  and the Falcons are looking to become the first team to ever play in the Super Bowl at home PERIOD

Atlantas sportsand their accompanying culturesare on the rise in the South PERIOD But now for the first time they have the venues to match PERIOD
