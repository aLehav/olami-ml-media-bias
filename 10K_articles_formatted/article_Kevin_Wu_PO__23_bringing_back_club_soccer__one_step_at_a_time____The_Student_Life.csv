We ended up taking something like  players for the club team Wu said PERIOD It was a really robust pack with a lot of talent it was very difficult whittling the team down to what we have today. following the tryouts however the team immediately faced hardship when Wu sustained an injury while biking PERIOD His knee contusion caused him to miss out on the first two weeks of the season PERIOD
