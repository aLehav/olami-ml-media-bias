4130,2002-01-14,"there have been a few letters suggesting I have played a pivotal role in the Goleta Project Area Committee flag incident and the recall efforts of third District Supervisor Gail Marshall PERIOD My wife and I went to the muchdiscussed GPAC meeting at the request of a longtime friend Joe Olla PERIOD If asked I would go and support him again PERIOD As an elected official for  years I pride myself in taking direct responsibility for my actions and the actions of my department PERIOD I believe your readers deserve a response PERIOD

Nobody could have predicted or choreographed the things that took place that night PERIOD They were the result of poor staff decisions and a spontaneous reaction by a county supervisor PERIOD Attempts to rewrite the events of the evening by her supporters havent helped PERIOD I never believed that the GPAC event was really an issue of patriotism with the supervisor and her staff rather it was an issue of poor judgement temper and truth PERIOD

The recall proponents wanted to proceed with their effort several months ago after redistricting PERIOD I and others publicly opposed that effort PERIOD But when Supervisor Marshall accused me of orchestrating the flag incident which ultimately resulted in Joes firing I changed my mind PERIOD The community unnecessarily lost a commonsense voice on the GPAC and years of volunteer effort by a respected Santa Ynez Valley citizen PERIOD

After the incident I was asked by some people who are not high profile and who I respect if I would be willing to run should enough people sign a recall petition and should an election be held PERIOD I said yes  if an election were held PERIOD There is no hidden agenda and should there be an election I plan on running and addressing all issues regarding the third District PERIOD I suspect others will as well PERIOD

I hope people give serious consideration to both sides of the recall PERIOD While there are no legally required criteria other than dissatisfaction with the elected official it is a serious matter that should not be taken lightly PERIOD Thats why it requires so many signatures PERIOD There are any number of rumors on both sides regarding threats misuse of the petitions the amount of time before the next regular election costs and motives of those involved PERIOD Please take the time to ask questions check the law and make an informed decision based on the facts PERIOD

Everyone has the right to send letters to the press PERIOD However with regards to me no one so far has had the courtesy to call and ask about the issues prior to publicly expressing their interpretation of my actions and motives PERIOD I have always been personally accessible to the citizens of our county PERIOD Should you have any questions of me regarding this or any other issue please email me at sheriffsbsheriff.org call my office at  or call my home at  PERIOD
