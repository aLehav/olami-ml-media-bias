Considerable cloudiness PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



If youre pregnant and your due date is fast approaching its important to be able to recognize the signs that youre dilating and in labor PERIOD

To help you better understand the stages of labor the signs of early and true labor and the differences between true labor and Braxton Hicks contractions Dr PERIOD Erin Higgins an obgyn at the Cleveland Clinic will walk you through the process PERIOD

Stages of labor

According to StatPearls there are three stages of labor

The first stage of labor is further broken down into two phases the latent phase sometimes called early labor and the active or true labor phase PERIOD

Signs of early labor

Dilation

One of the early signs of labor is called dilation which is when your cervix stretches to make room for the baby according to the Cleveland Clinic PERIOD Dilation is measured in centimeters PERIOD

When we talk about active labor versus latent laborits the difference between when youre less than  centimeters in latent labor and more than  centimeters in active labor Higgins explained PERIOD

Mild irregular contractions

Higgins said contractions are one of the classic signs of labor and can show up as mild cramping in the latent phase PERIOD She recommended calling the hospital if youre experiencing any type of contraction PERIOD

I can kind of assess over the phone to determine like oh this is likely early labor PERIOD Keep watching at home until the contractions get a certain strength or time apart frequency she said PERIOD

Water breaks

The U.S PERIOD National Library of Medicine says that when the amniotic sac that holds the baby inside the uterus breaks open the water that filled that sac is released through your vagina PERIOD

Higgins noted that with the water breaking talking about a full termpregnancy were going to admit you and have a baby once we do the physical exam to confirm that the water has broken. bloody show

Bloody show is one of the signs youre dilating according to the Library of Medicine PERIOD You might notice a brown discharge and see the mucous plug which keeps the cervix sealed during pregnancy PERIOD

Is nausea a sign of labor

Wonderbaby.org notes that when your body gets ready for labor blood is moved away from the digestive system to muscles and this may lead to some feelings of nausea PERIOD

Nausea is kind of another one of those things thats super common throughout pregnancy Higgins explained PERIOD I would say that its not necessarily a sign of labor but again something you can always call and ask about. signs of active labor

Increased dilation

When your cervix is dilated  centimeters youre considered to be in the active or true phase of firststage labor PERIOD While early labor dilation is slower StatPearls says active labor dilation happens more quickly PERIOD

Regular contractions that increase in strength

In active labor Higgins noted that your contractions strengthen and become more regular PERIOD

Labor contractions we tend to see anywhere from every two to three minutes every four to five minutes regular she advised PERIOD You can set your clock by it and theres a lot of apps out there for people to monitor their contractions on. diarrhea

A lot of people ask is diarrhea a sign of labor Higgins noted that some women do experience diarrhea during labor PERIOD

I believe its a hormonal effect  due to the prostaglandins she said PERIOD

Braxton Hicks contractions

People can have Braxton Hicks contractions for several weeks leading up to true labor explained Higgins PERIOD Theyre kind of referred to also as false labor. i kind of differentiate from my patients saying is it just kind of more annoying Its not necessarily painful its not necessarily it doesnt stop you from doingwhat youre doing Higgins continued PERIOD Its just kind of like oh OK thats annoying PERIOD Whereas true labor contractions tend to stop you in your step. when to call your health care provider

If you experience any of the above signs of labor Higgins said its important to call your health care provider PERIOD She also recommended contacting your obgyn if you think youre experiencing preterm labor or a dangerous pregnancy condition called preeclampsia which is marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine PERIOD

I would just say the signs of preterm labor are pretty much the signs of labor happening prior to  weeks of pregnancy Higgins said PERIOD The symptoms of preeclampsia can be an unrelenting  headache spots or floaters in the vision and pain in the upper belly more so on the right side PERIOD

Just whenever somebodys feeling kind of crummy at the end of pregnancy its generally good to touch base with your doctor just to find out and make sure everythings OK that theres nothing that needs to be checked out she advised PERIOD
