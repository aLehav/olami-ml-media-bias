Georgetownorganization founderArjun Gupta COL  and member James McLoughlin MSB  open up about Fundraisr which provides pro bono services to nonprofits in Washington D.C PERIOD Both Gupta and McLoughlin share a passion for social justice issues and have been working on Fundraisr since the fall semester in the hopes of making a positive impact in the D.C PERIOD community one partner at a time PERIOD They sat down with The Hoya this week to discuss the success growing pains and future goals of Fundraisr PERIOD

What inspired you to start Fundraisr

Arjun Gupta COL  The idea for the organization comes from the idea that in D.C PERIOD there are more nonprofits per capita than any other city in the country and there is huge disparity between where we are at Georgetown and across the river PERIOD When you talk to most nonprofits they would tell you that fundraising is the hardest thing that they do PERIOD A lot of nonprofits dont have the money and people to focus on really big marketing campaigns PERIOD They arent able to hire companies to do it for them because of money reasons PERIOD We saw that we are Georgetown students  we have time we are creative and we try to fill a role by working with these smaller organizations pro bono on their fundraising strategies PERIOD

How do you compensate for your undergraduate status in terms of your credibility and qualifications

Gupta Were pro bono and the thing that most organizations love is that were free help PERIOD Fundraising today is very centered on social media and technology and the one thing we can bring to the table is this almost innate knowledge of how to use social media and the ability to have a faster learning curve PERIOD A lot of the people who run these organizations never grew up with and have never extensively used social media PERIOD Were creative passionate students PERIOD

Fundraisr isnt part of the Student Activities Commission and doesnt seek to be recognized by the university PERIOD Why is this

Gupta Were in the process of applying for nonprofit status PERIOD This is really important for our credibility because it shows that we arent just a club on campus which is how people generally perceive us and is something that we dont necessarily want to be perceived as PERIOD We are a group of students and we do a lot of things that clubs do  we have fun together  but in our professional environment we want to be seen as people who do the job well PERIOD Nonprofit status is definitely something that improves that and will help us in the long term PERIOD Getting to be a part of SAC is a long tedious process and in the short term weve really tried to focus on growing the organization as opposed to just focusing on becoming part of SAC and I dont really see a lot of the benefits of it PERIOD Were able to do a lot on campus  meet in rooms book rooms plan events  without the help of SAC PERIOD

Is there an example of a project youve done or a connection youve made this past semester that youre proud of or want to speak about

James McLoughlin MSB  We organized ice skating events two weeks in a row on Thursday nights down at the Georgetown Waterfront PERIOD We partnered with the ice skating rink there and sold discounted tickets  tickets are  there and we sold them for  and  of the  went to FAN D.C PERIOD It was a good way to raise money and we raised over  PERIOD

Gupta Another example was Giving Tuesday which happens the Tuesday after Thanksgiving every year PERIOD Its a big day for people to donate to nonprofits and we ran a campaign for FAN around Giving Tuesday PERIOD We had a crowdfunding campaign ran all their social media we were able to do all of that for them PERIOD

For students who are interested and want to get involved how should they go about doing that

McLoughlin We just finished our hiring process so were not looking for any more new people this semester but if they have any interest they can email us at emailprotected PERIOD Or they can visit our website fundraisrdc.org or our Facebook page PERIOD

Gupta Were going to go through another hiring process in the fall and what were really looking for is people who are creative and passionate PERIOD

Is there anything else that you want to add or something I havent asked you that you think is important

Gupta The goal of our organization is not to raise money for these nonprofits  thats just the avenue through which we do it PERIOD Our goal is to make sure these nonprofits make a bigger impact in the community PERIOD At the end of the day weve succeeded if the nonprofit were working with succeeds and thats a big measure of success as opposed to just the amount of money raised PERIOD

McLoughlin We arent just focused on shortterm fundraising profits we also want to create a sustainable fundraising base PERIOD It doesnt really make much sense to get them X amount of dollars this year and then leave them back at square one PERIOD Our goal is to change the way they fundraise and give them an easy platform to use so that they can do it for years to come PERIOD
