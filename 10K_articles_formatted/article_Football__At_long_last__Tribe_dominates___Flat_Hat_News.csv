8453,2023-11-05,"winless in its last four tries William and Mary desperately needed a victory Saturday night PERIOD Midway through the fourth quarter the Tribe held an 18point lead but that wasnt enough PERIOD The College needed a big score to ice the game and secure its first win of the season PERIOD

Enter Keith McBride PERIOD

The sophomore tailback took the handoff at the Georgia State 36yard line and started running along the right side of the offensive line PERIOD He found a hole saw daylight and broke through the first line of defenders PERIOD A pair of Georgia State defenders sprinted at him pushing him toward the sideline PERIOD McBride sidestepped both breaking a leg tackle and churned all the way to the endzone for the score effectively putting the game away and sealing the Tribes first victory of the year PERIOD

William and Mary  took out its frustrations on Georgia State earning a  victory in Williamsburg Saturday in a battle of winless teams PERIOD The College benefited from a very opportunistic defense that forced seven Georgia State turnovers  the most in one game since  PERIOD The Tribe offense did its part putting up  points the teams highest offensive output this season PERIOD

I thought we played pretty hard tonight  a lot of enthusiasm  played with some excitement and made some things happen head coach Jimmye Laycock said PERIOD I think defensively we set the tone with the amount of turnovers they got PERIOD Thats what weve been talking about and stressing and they really swarmed around and set the tone for everything PERIOD And then offensively our running game got on track tonight PERIOD  It was a good solid win a good win and finally we got one. the Tribe defense held the Panthers to  yards of total offense but the story of the day was the amount of turnovers PERIOD The Tribe collected four interceptions off Georgia State quarterback Ronnie Bell PERIOD Bell a slippery quarterback with an ability to scramble consistently unleashed illadvised passes that the Tribe gladly converted into interceptions PERIOD

After a lethargic performance last weekend against Delaware during which the College gave up  points it responded extremely well against the Panthers PERIOD The Tribe swarmed to the ball hit hard and forced three fumbles all of which were recovered by the defense PERIOD

Thats been a point of emphasis all week just coming out with intensity and excitement that creates turnovers senior safety Brian Thompson who recorded an interception of his own Saturday said PERIOD This week we wanted to change what weve been doing and really have fun out there PERIOD  We got a lot of picks and fumbles by running around and having fun. the Tribes stellar defensive performance often put the offense in good field position PERIOD Four of the Tribes five touchdowns were the direct result of Georgia State turnovers PERIOD Regardless of its starting field position the College produced its most commanding offensive performance this season relying heavily on the running game PERIOD

McBride led the College with  yards and two touchdowns on  carries PERIOD Sophomore tailback Darnell Laws was also effective in a limited number of carries running for  yards on six carries including a 26yard touchdown run in the third quarter PERIOD

I think we did really well on the ground McBride said PERIOD The offensive line blocked really well they opened up some holes PERIOD As a running back it was our job to gash them and really reward those guys PERIOD I was proud of how we ran the ball today. sophomore quarterback Raphael Ortiz earned his first win in three starts Saturday PERIOD Ortiz turned in a decent performance in the air going  of  for  yards and no interceptions but his best work was done on the ground PERIOD Ortiz rushed  times for  yards and two touchdowns showing his prowess as a mobile quarterback PERIOD

Laycock was impressed with Ortizs continued improvement PERIOD

I thought Ortiz played really well PERIOD I saw a lot of things out there that he did out there that people wouldnt have seen Laycock said PERIOD We had a couple of little gadget plays called that he checked us out of because they just werent set up right PERIOD  Im becoming very confident in his ability to manage the game. the Tribe will look to build on this victory and put another complete performance together next weekend when it travels to Philadelphia to take on UPenn PERIOD

Weve got something now its kind of a blueprint now Laycock said PERIOD This is the way we need to be to play pretty well PERIOD Now lets take that and move forward with it PERIOD I hope we do PERIOD I give a lot of credit to the seniors for stepping up this week and saying Enoughs enough PERIOD Lets step it up and lets get going playing. save my name email and website in this browser for the next time I comment PERIOD
