Mount Holyoke students and their guests dressed up to celebrate gracious living dinners in the dining halls PERIOD

BY SABA FIAZUDDIN 

The gracious dinner tradition has been a key component of Mount Holyoke life for decades PERIOD In the 1950s students would dress up for a special meal known as gracious living dinners which were served in dorms and often followed by tea or coffee in the common room PERIOD Through the years the tradition has evolved  for example students are no longer required to come wearing stockings and heels  and the launch of centralized dining in the spring will kickstart a new phase PERIOD

According to Kathryn Gay the menu coordinator for dining services gracious dinners have always been served as monotony breakers to allow a respite from the usual menu PERIOD Gay said They were usually planned with a fun theme such as Fall Carnival Tailgating Welcome to New England Day of the Dead Bread and Cheese Bar and Chinese New Year. gay recounted meeting with a student before each gracious dinner who represented one of six languages  Chinese Japanese German French Italian and Spanish  to help plan a menu based on that culture PERIOD

Gracious dinners in their early years offered a chance for students to dine with not just their classmates but also special guests such as professors and their families PERIOD Often girls find these dinners a perfect opportunity to invite faculty or administration and their families to the dorm said a Mount Holyoke Freshman Handbook from  PERIOD a perfect way to discover that the man who was formidable behind the desk is human after all. psychology professor Katherine Haydon  remembers attending gracious dinners fondly PERIOD For gracious dinners we always took time for a longer meal than usual said Haydon PERIOD My friends and I would push the big round tables together in the dining hall and sit and talk for hours over dinner PERIOD Those nights felt like holidays to us a time to take a break from everything together. a specific gracious dinner memory sticks with Haydon When I lived in the Delles I attended a gracious dinner at  where the Chef Jeff was head chef PERIOD He often made extra dishes that were off the menu PERIOD That night the first really chilly night of the fall he made a butternut squash bisque PERIOD I still remember how good that bisque tasted and how cozy I felt sitting there looking out over the lake. photos courtesy of the Mount Holyoke Archives and Special Collections

Students attended Wednesday night gracious living teas in the common rooms of their dorms following dinner PERIOD

Gracious dinners held in recent years have been decorated with tablecloths candles and cloth napkins and have introduced a variety of ethnic food to the daily menu PERIOD A menu card from a  Chinese gracious dinner found in the Archives and Special Collections boasts dishes such as Yangchow Fried Rice and Bok Choy and Bamboo Shoots. gargi Mishra  who has been to many gracious dinners throughout her time at Mount Holyoke said I have really enjoyed eating at gracious dinners since my first year at MHC PERIOD The ambience during gracious dinners is always very warm and welcoming and I think they are a great way of connecting with friends PERIOD I hope that something similar to gracious dinners exists in SuperBlanch. ya Qin  agreed having attended all of the gracious dinners held so far during her first semester at Mount Holyoke PERIOD My first gracious dinner added some color to my daily life she said PERIOD It was so refreshing to have something different and I hope that this tradition continues for many years to come. students voiced concern that the closing of dorm dining halls could mean the end of gracious dinners PERIOD Richard Perna director of dining services has confirmed that this dearly loved tradition will not be coming to an end any time soon and will continue to be held at the new community center complete with traditional linen tablecloths and napkins PERIOD With the new center will come new features of gracious dinner including cook to order. with the enhanced space we will have more variety and flexibility said Perna PERIOD
