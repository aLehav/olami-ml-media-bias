UPDATE We have changed the preferred email address to send feedback to after learning the originally posted address was sending error messages PERIOD Please send all feedback to eicmichigandaily.com

On Saturday confusion spread across campus as unconfirmed reports of an active shooter in Mason Hall circulated on social media PERIOD Though these reports turned out to be unfounded the fear people on campus felt as the reports surfaced was real PERIOD It became clear how terrifying these situations can be  and it became clear just how fast information can spread on campus PERIOD

We the editors of The Michigan Daily want to take responsibility for tweeting unconfirmed information on The Dailys Twitter account including unsubstantiated reports of wounded students PERIOD We deleted the tweets as soon as the harmful effects were brought to our attention and we issued a correction immediately after PERIOD As the primary news outlet covering the University of Michigan we at The Daily felt we had a responsibility to jump into action and inform the public of what was going on PERIOD Fortunately we havent had to deal with a major crisis  or the immediate possibility of one  on campus in recent years PERIOD Unfortunately that meant we were acting based on instinct and with little foresight beyond wanting to keep campus as safe as possible PERIOD

After these events it has become clear that we need to develop direct protocols for breaking news events that potentially threaten public safety PERIOD Our promise to our readers is that we will be better prepared if another incident of this gravity occurs in the University or Ann Arbor community PERIOD The Daily has consulted other media outlets for advice and tips and will continue to discuss different facets of our new protocols with professionals and members of our community PERIOD We hope to consult with University Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County security and police forces in order to better understand how we can inform the public PERIOD Our new protocol will be approved by our Management Desk the group of managing editors and senior editors that make significant decisions for our editorial staff PERIOD We hope we never have to use these protocols but we acknowledge and respect the need to have them and our need to function within them properly PERIOD

Going forward in addition to working on a crisis protocol we plan to report on this as we would any other situation on campus PERIOD We will press on the institutions involved and address student concerns about the Universitys and police forces response to the event PERIOD

Finally we want to express our support for marginalized communities on campus PERIOD Yesterdays events  including our unconfirmed tweets  disproportionately affected students of color on campus especially the Muslim community which was holding a vigil for last weeks shootings at two New Zealand mosques at the time the crisis began PERIOD The Daily would like to acknowledge the undue stress this has caused to those communities PERIOD

This incident is a learning experience for us at The Daily and we want to hear feedback from you the reader PERIOD Our mission is to report facts and best serve those who read our publication PERIOD Our call for public feedback is necessary so we can address your concerns and incorporate them into that mission as much as possible PERIOD If you read The Michigan Daily or follow our Twitter or Facebook accounts we want to hear from you PERIOD If you are a media professional a law enforcement professional or University affiliate we want to hear from you PERIOD If you are a student with thoughts about how we can best serve your community we want to hear from you PERIOD Please email eicmichigandaily.com with your thoughts PERIOD

Sincerely

The Managing Editors of The Michigan Daily
