Associated Students Inc PERIOD President Terry Martin spoke about ASIs accomplishments over the past year in a speech today in the Union Lobby PERIOD

Around  students attended the event where ASI served pizza and held a raffle PERIOD

Martin who graduates in May with a degree in economics addressed topics such as fee increases elections and ways for students to get involved on campus PERIOD

Martin also addressed campus safety issues involving sexual assaults that have plagued the campus this year PERIOD

Never in my years on campus has safety ever been a bigger issue Martin said PERIOD

Added security and selfdefense classes have started up on campus as ways to help offset the risk of further assaults PERIOD

Martin brought up the importance of academic advising PERIOD He said it is essential in order to get students through college ideally in four years and get them on the way to dream jobs PERIOD

He also reminded students of the OneCard program which allows students to get discounts at certain businesses when they use their card PERIOD

Although students have enough financial worries Martin said more fee increases are on the way PERIOD The athletics fee increases to  next year PERIOD Students in  voted down the increase but that vote was later overturned PERIOD

Im personally opposed to the increases Martin said PERIOD It just makes students wonder why they even voted on it if it was just going to get overturned. a major theme of Martins speech was student involvement through participation in student government and activism PERIOD

He encouraged students to come up to the ASI office located on the third floor of the University Union once in a while to further communication between the organization and students PERIOD

One of the issues Martin was most excited about was the foundation of a student activism class which teaches students how to lobby legislation and to get messages across PERIOD

Secretary of State Affairs Brandon Sisk praised Martin for mentioning student activist issues PERIOD

Im glad he encouraged students to get involved in the March  rally on the capital Sisk said PERIOD

Christine Zhu sophomore psychology major thought the speech went really well and had a decent turnout PERIOD

I think its important for students to get involved Zhu said PERIOD Some people mind their own business on campus and ASI is important in that it reaches out to those students. martin said it is events like this that help him keep in touch with students PERIOD

I think its important I meet the students face to face Martin said PERIOD I can communicate with them better this way than with the occasional oped for the Hornet. with so many young and bright students at Sacramento State Martin said he is positive about the future of ASI on campus PERIOD

He sees todays speech as an opportunity to spread the word to those who may want to take part in the organization PERIOD

I hope people walk by today and think ASI might be a cool thing to be a part of and maybe follow in my footsteps Martin said PERIOD
