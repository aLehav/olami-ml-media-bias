A lot of things have changed for Penn State since the football team joined the ranks of the Big Ten a decade ago PERIOD

One area that has been arguably the most dynamic in nature is recruiting PERIOD

Since the Nittany Lions became a member of the Big Ten Penn State has lost its dominance in certain areas of the East Coast to other teams in the conference but has also gotten its foot in the door of previously unrecruited regions of the country PERIOD

 Penn State football coach Joe Paterno said PERIOD 

In this years recruiting class the Fighting Irish won a recent recruiting battle with the Lions over California wide receiver Anthony Vernaglia PERIOD Last season running back Jason Evans decommitted from Penn State and ultimately signed with Stanford PERIOD

This isnt to say that the Lions havent been able to land top rated players PERIOD In the  class alone they have verbals from topranked linebacker Dan Connor nationally ranked defensive lineman A.Q PERIOD Shipley and nationally ranked offensive lineman Greg Harrison PERIOD Both Stanford and Notre Dame showed heavy interest in all three prospects PERIOD

But Paterno said he expected this to happen once the program jumped aboard the Big Ten PERIOD

 Paterno said PERIOD 

Some of the conferences coaches have confirmed Paternos original prediction PERIOD

At Julys Big Ten Kickoff Luncheon Purdue football coach Joe Tiller said that before Penn State joined the Big Ten the Lions had a lock on all recruits who came out of New Jersey PERIOD Since then the door has opened up for other schools most notably Wisconsin Iowa and the Boilermakers to raid for talent PERIOD

In fact some of those teams best players are from the former Penn State stronghold of the Garden State PERIOD The Badgers stud running back Anthony Davis is from Plainfield NJ PERIOD Purdue defensive end Shaun Phillips one of the nations best pass rushers hails from Willingboro NJ PERIOD Last season the Hawkeyes landed the top running back in New Jersey and The Star Ledgers Offensive Player of the Year Albert Young PERIOD

This isnt to say Paterno and his staff havent been able to land top prospects from New Jersey themselves PERIOD Starting defensive tackles Jay Alford and Tamba Hali both nationally recruited high school players are from the same northeast region of New Jersey PERIOD

However the reason for the shift in the recruiting landscape over the years has been the fact that the perennial powerhouse has brought more exposure to other programs by playing them on a yearly basis PERIOD

So as Penn States grip on the Eastern part of the country declined a little its clout in the Midwest and Southeast increased PERIOD It became mutually beneficial PERIOD

Continued exposure on the national level is only one area that has given Penn State the inside track on particular regions and players across the country PERIOD

At least one other aspect of the Penn State football program is enough to have recruits drooling to don the blue and white PERIOD

Paterno the man himself PERIOD

Some critics of the Lions program consider Paterno a weak link in the chain of recruiting specifically that the septuagenarian cant relate to 18year old kids PERIOD

According to numerous players Paterno was able to sign this is merely a construct other programs have drubbed up in a campaign to  and smear Penn State PERIOD

 linebacker T.C PERIOD Cosby said PERIOD



Coach Johnson and coach Paterno said they would be here for four years and I didnt worry about that PERIOD It wasnt too big a choice and I was very happy I knew coach would be here.How can you say no to a living legend
