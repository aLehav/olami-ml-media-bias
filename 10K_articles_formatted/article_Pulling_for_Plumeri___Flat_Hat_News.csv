8409,2023-11-05,"when I heard Joe Plumeri  was selected to give the Commencement address at this years graduation I had the same response as most of my classmates Who Plumeri has made his mark in the rather invisible realm of business and finance and is not as well known as recent speakers like Jon Stewart PERIOD But after reading up a bit on the man though it seems that he is well qualified to address this years graduates PERIOD No matter what he might actually say  and he promises he will talk about topics directly relevant to students  his life and career serve as an interesting example of how graduates might find their way in the real world PERIOD

His story is a feelgood tale The son of Italian immigrants from Trenton N.J PERIOD Plumeri grew up to be a business titan through his perseverance ability passion and more than a little good luck PERIOD We have heard variations on this story a thousand times before what makes Plumeri interesting to graduating seniors like myself is the winding road his life took after graduating from the College of William and Mary PERIOD
Plumeri majored in history and education at the College and decided to become a history teacher PERIOD After college he taught history for two years in rural Pennsylvania PERIOD He then joined the U.S PERIOD Army Reserve and was stationed in South Carolina for six months PERIOD He enrolled in New York Law School in  after his reserve PERIOD

At that time he believed he had found his profession PERIOD Plumeri wished to gain practical experience while at school so he went door to door on Wall Street in search of a part time job at a law firm PERIOD In the directory of one building he saw the small firm Carter Berlind Potoma and Weill PERIOD Assuming anything with that many names had to be a law firm he asked the receptionist who he should speak to for a job PERIOD He wound up in the office of Sandy Weil and spoke at length about his interest in working in law PERIOD  It was only after he finished his pitch that the man on the other side of the desk informed him he had walked into a brokerage firm PERIOD In the end he got a job as a gofer and later dropped out of law school to work for the company full time PERIOD It was a wise choice  the little brokerage eventually grew into the financial giant Citigroup PERIOD

Plumeris story is instructive in many ways PERIOD For one it tells us the plans for our future that we may have now are always subject to the whims of fate PERIOD We should not be too confined by our own idea of what our careers should be PERIOD Plumeri is where he is today because of a happy coincidence he embraced and used to his advantage PERIOD For those of us without a solid post graduation plan yet thats a bit of a comfort PERIOD If you do have a plan it might provide a sense of freedom to know you are not trapped on an unalterable course PERIOD

There is only one detail about Plumeri that worries PERIOD He once gave a motivational speech for five hours pausing only to change his sweatsoaked shirt PERIOD I really hope that doesnt happen to us PERIOD
