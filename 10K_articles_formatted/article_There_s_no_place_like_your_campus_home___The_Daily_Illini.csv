Its that time of year again PERIOD Were all back on campus eyes bright and tails bushy ready to take on another semester PERIOD This will be the year we make things happen PERIOD Well get enough sleep read for all of our classes and improve our GPAs PERIOD Well work out eat healthy and make new friends PERIOD

OK lets be honest with ourselves PERIOD As our August optimism wears off college life will become routine PERIOD Bars will look more attractive than books PERIOD Sleeping will take priority to studying PERIOD For the weak among us Scrubs and I Love the 90s reruns will occupy more of our time than class and our GPAs will remain unchanged if were lucky PERIOD

Bearing that in mind I would like to offer a challenge Get involved PERIOD Make a commitment and keep it PERIOD Yes it will require more energy than eating Easy Mac and navigating through the New Facebook but it might be the most important thing you do in college PERIOD

People often complain that the UI feels too big PERIOD My best friend chose another school precisely for that reason PERIOD The size can be daunting there are more than  of us on this campus and millions of alumni and Illini fans worldwide PERIOD

While it is intimidating at times like when you walk into your first 500person lecture the sheer size of the Illini community guarantees that theres a niche for everyone PERIOD



And the size makes involvement pretty simple just grab the pile of fliers and pamphlets you assembled on Quad Day PERIOD You know the ones you reluctantly accepted in exchange for a free Frisbee or water bottle PERIOD Pick a club that sounds interesting sign up and show up PERIOD

The first club I joined was quite an experience PERIOD The clock struck midnight at Altgeld on my first Wednesday as a college student PERIOD I skated up to Foellinger and found a large group of people all on some form of wheels awaiting a nighttime ride PERIOD They were the Inline Insomniacs and that night was a rush PERIOD We skated seven miles through deserted parks in Urbana and after several nearwipeouts wound up back on the Quad PERIOD If youre a night owl with stellar night vision this club is for you PERIOD

The political junkies out there will like the Student Senate internship program PERIOD Student Senate has come a long way in the last few years from a few friends financing office furniture with student fee money to a hardworking group of student advocates PERIOD Though the history of ISS is sprinkled with corruption it has developed into a mostly functional usually efficient organization that does a lot of good on campus PERIOD With this years determined leadership I see only good things for ISS in the future PERIOD www.iss.uiuc.edu

If you like to volunteer Volunteer Illini Projects has something for everyone literally PERIOD Sign up for the Listserv warning your inbox will be filled and show up for volunteer projects that sound cool PERIOD You can volunteer once a week once a month or once a semester PERIOD I met my roommate at a VIP event freshman year For more information contact Lhea Randle at emailprotected PERIOD

This past summer I was lucky enough to be part of an organization called Camp Kesem PERIOD This weeklong camp targets an oftoverlooked demographic kids who have a parent with cancer PERIOD Outside of crazy camp names hilarious songs and more lake swimming than you could ask for we did some serious talking and formed a strong support group for these kids and each other PERIOD If you have a lot of energy and you want to meet some amazing UI students get involved in Camp Kesem PERIOD www.campkesem.orgillinois

These are just a few of the great opportunities this campus has to offer PERIOD So freshmen get started early PERIOD Sophomores take on those leadership positions PERIOD Juniors and seniors its not too late PERIOD Were in college for four five short years PERIOD Dont sleep them away PERIOD Dont veg out in front of the TV or spend your entire weekend hungover PERIOD Find a campus community that suits you and become a part of it PERIOD Make the University of Illinois your home and youll be amazed at what you learn in the process PERIOD

Katie is a senior is political science and Spanish and the new IMPE blows her mind PERIOD",There's no place like your campus home - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
