478,2023-10-23,"with an unusually crowded field of candidates vying to be student body president students can select from candidates with varying degrees of experience PERIOD
As president of the Associated Students of the University of Utah the winning candidate will have partial control over a budget of about . million derived from student fees will work as the student lobbyist to the State Legislature and will help form campus policy on issues such mandatory health insurance PERIOD
The following is an analysis of the candidates and their experience for office PERIOD
Rick Pehrson Forward Party
From looking at his rsum it is clear Rick Pehrson has had a long career in ASUU PERIOD
He has served in several senior positions including chief of staff and attorney general where he has helped manage the government and draft key legislation PERIOD
Pehrson has also completed two internships for the Hinckley Institute of Politics one for a Republican in the State Legislature and the other with a medical group in Washington D.C PERIOD 
While Pehrson undoubtedly has more ASUU experience than any other candidate he has aside from ASUU primarily been involved in the LDS Institute of Religion PERIOD His running mate Clayton McDonald is also heavily involved in the institute PERIOD
 Pehrson therefore may have a hard time reaching out beyond the LDS and ASUU voting blocks PERIOD
Spencer Pearson FUSE Party
As a team Spencer Pearson and his running mate Basim Motiwala are perhaps the frontrunners in the race PERIOD
Though he has a fair amount of ASUU experience Spencer Pearsons advantage as a candidate may be his connection to Greek Row PERIOD
As a member of Sigma Chi the largest traditional fraternity on campus Pearson can expect to get support from most of the greeks who consequently form a large portion of the students who actually vote in elections PERIOD
Of the past six student body presidents four have been members of the fraternity Sigma Chi PERIOD 
Pearson may also get support from his participation in LDSSA and the Student Alumni Association PERIOD
Motiwala who seemed a strong candidate for president on his own when he was earlier rumored to be running for the position is also a member of Sigma Chi and has experience in ASUU as campus relations board director and an assembly representative PERIOD
Motiwala is also appealing because of his diverse background PERIOD As the descendent of Pakistani immigrants he will likely be able to appeal to other minority students and voters who think ASUU should be doing more to encourage diversity on campus PERIOD
Cameron Beech Activate Party
Cameron Beech has a lot of variety in his campus experiences PERIOD He worked as an executive assistant to current Student Body President Jake Kirkham and was media spokesman for Kirkham PERIOD
On top of his ASUU experience Beech was involved on Greek Row as vice president of the Kappa Sigma fraternity and served as an officer in the Residence Halls PERIOD
Beech will likely get some support from voters in the Residence Halls especially since his running mate Ryan Carrier currently works as a resident adviser PERIOD
Though Beech  has strong experience he is much younger than the other candidates and has had less time to develop connections or participate in political internships PERIOD
Joe Coccimiglio More  U Party
Out of all the candidates Joe Coccimmiligo has the least amount of ASUU experience PERIOD Aside from a semester as a representative in the General Assembly and some campaign work he has had no involvement in the student government PERIOD
However a lack of ASUU experience doesnt mean hes been twiddling his thumbs for four years PERIOD
Unlike any other candidate Coccimmiligo has worked in the White House travel department and the U.S PERIOD Embassy in Lima Peru through the Hinckley Institute of Politics PERIOD 
His running mate Craig Hammond has similarly limited experience in ASUU PERIOD Besides working as an assistant director for the finance board for a semester he has held no formal position PERIOD
Coccimmiligo and Hammond are both members of an LDS fraternity though and could draw support from students there PERIOD
