2319,2023-11-04,"as President Barack Obama reforms the decadeold No Child Left Behind Act by lifting portions of the law its effect in certain regions of the United States is still apparent PERIOD And apparently it has gotten pretty ugly PERIOD

Certain provisions of No Child Left Behind allowed state officials in Arizona to review teachers and assess their accents for suitability teaching in a classroom PERIOD This accent policing continued from the time the act was enacted in  until just two weeks ago when facing a civil rights lawsuit Arizona struck an agreement with federal officials to stop monitoring classrooms for mispronounced words and poor grammar according to The Arizona Republic PERIOD

A New York Times article published just days ago elaborates on some of this policing PERIOD According to one state education official accents were not the focus of classroom monitoring PERIOD But that still does not explain why some school and state officials have continued to confront teachers about their accents especially when the same teachers approved by school districts were being approached on a federal level for infractions such as pronouncing the as da and another as anuder. we understand that having teachers who can speak clearly is a very important facet of having the job and we in no way condemn schools for taking the appropriate measures to ensure that teachers in Englishspeaking classrooms have the level of language proficiency required to teach those students PERIOD

But when teachers are being monitored and written up for having the slightest accent especially on a federal level the issue starts to get a bit fishier PERIOD



America is well understood to be a melting pot where different cultures come to participate in whatever field they want to or are able to PERIOD And having a slight accent should not be a barrier to teaching a classroom of children if the teacher in question is fluent in the language and can be understood clearly PERIOD

Enforcing a vague law that sets easily bendable parameters for policing teachers is just bad form  and up until two weeks ago when the policing was called off by civil lawsuit threats Arizona was the only state in the union practicing this PERIOD

Setting individual policies on a schoolbyschool basis requiring written and oral language proficiency tests makes sense PERIOD But when the policy becomes an easily abused policy that targets people with accents thats when we begin to see a problem  what constitutes an accent that restricts learning PERIOD",Accented educators targeted by No Child Left Behind Act - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
