Myles Gaskin runs into the end zone for his first of two touchdowns of the Fiesta Bowl PERIOD

Im coming back PERIOD

Three simple words that signaled junior tailback Myles Gaskins return to the program for his fourth and final season with the Washington Huskies PERIOD

After saying he was  on his decision to forgo his final season at the UW after the Fiesta Bowl Gaskin took to Twitter to tell Husky fans directly that he would return next season capping his message with a GoDawgz. gaskin joins fellow juniors Jake Browning  Greg Gaines  Kaleb McGary  and JoJo McIntosh as the key returnees who possibly could have turned pro after the end of the  season PERIOD

With over  career rushing yards and  career rushing touchdowns Gaskin is in a prime position to shatter every career UW rushing record PERIOD

The only Washington football player to leave early this season was junior standout defensive tackle Vita Vea  who is a projected first round selection in the upcoming  NFL Draft PERIOD

Gaskin was speculated to be a thirdday selection as late as the sixth round if he were to have left PERIOD

With Browning Gaskin McGary and star tackle Trey Adams all returning for the UW offense next season this could be a group who could perform even better than it did during its  campaign in Browning and Gaskins second season PERIOD
