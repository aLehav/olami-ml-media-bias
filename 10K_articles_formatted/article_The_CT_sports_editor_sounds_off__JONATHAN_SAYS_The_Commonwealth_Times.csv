NBA

If the Mavericks still are able to get Jason Kidd from the
Nets look for Dallas to immediately become a frontrunner for
the NBA title PERIOD Dallas cant compete with the front lines of Los
Angeles Phoenix or San Antonio but the addition of Kidd would
solidify the point guard spot PERIOD Devin Harris is a great player but
Kidd is on another level PERIOD Kidd is one of the main reasons for the
Nets success in recent years and probably would have brought
a title to New Jersey had the Shaq and Kobeled Lakers not
been in their prime PERIOD

MLB

Im tired of the issue of steroids in baseball PERIOD Im tired of Roger
Clemens and Im tired of Jose Canseco and John Rocker coming
out of the woodwork every three years PERIOD Andy Pettitte did things the
right way  he admitted his steroid use he apologized and he walked
away PERIOD Clemens could learn a thing or two from his teammate PERIOD
The point has been made that if Clemens just had done the
same thing Pettitte had this entire investigation would be over PERIOD
I dont know if its pride or if Clemens really thinks he didnt
take anything out of the ordinary but there are way too many
people who say Rocket took banned substances for Clemens
to continue to plead innocent PERIOD My advice  just say you did
it Roger PERIOD Even if you didnt everybody thinks you did which
makes you guilty in the public eye PERIOD Also I dont want to know
how much of the general publics tax dollars are going toward
these congressional hearings PERIOD This shouldnt be an issue in
Capitol Hill anyway PERIOD

AROUND CAMPUS

I try to avoid being superstitious Im very bad at this but
after the mens basketball team lost to Old Dominion Saturday
night I say do away with the yellow jerseys PERIOD This is hard for
me  those jerseys looked sweet and I really like yellow  but
when the Monarchs break a streak of never winning at the
Siegel Center along with handing VCU its first conference loss
at home its time to put those jerseys away and stick with the
home white PERIOD

On another note it was good to see the Wheelchair Posse
honored at halftime PERIOD Ryan and Eric were two loyal VCU basketball
fans and two great representatives of Virginia Commonwealth
University PERIOD The circles on the floor in their honor are a perfect
touch PERIOD
