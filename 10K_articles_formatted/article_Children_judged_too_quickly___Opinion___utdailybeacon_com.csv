James Dobson needs to sit down and be quiet PERIOD Its not  PERIOD His times over PERIOD His audience is predominantly aging and disenchanted as can be seen by their failure to either show up or vote for candidates he supported in the  midterm elections PERIOD He really just needs to sit down and be quiet PERIOD

This past week in an opinion column published in The New York Times Dobson informed the public of a meeting that had taken place September  in Salt Lake City between over fifty prolife leaders in which it was decided that if neither major party nominated a candidate with a prolife platform then the prolife community would refuse to endorse a major candidate and would instead support the formation of a third party with a candidate that had sufficiently profamily views PERIOD

Last time I checked despite his own personal misgivings Dobson wasnt the Emperor of Evangelical Christians so he and his fifty buddies in Utah shouldnt purport to speak for millions of individuals PERIOD

Even if one ignores the fact that Dobson is eminently less powerful in real life than in his mind the decision to run a third party candidate is against his interests PERIOD In each of the last four elections interest groups on the left and the right have put significant time and money into third party candidates PERIOD In each of those cases conservatives with Perot in  and  and liberals with Nader in  and  the major party candidate that would have best served the purposes of the special interest groups has lost so common sense says its really not a good idea to support a third party candidate PERIOD This leaves me with one of two conclusions Either Dobson is stupid or evil PERIOD And I dont know which bothers me more PERIOD

Option Stupid

In six polls this year Gallup has asked individuals whom they would vote for in a twoperson race between Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani PERIOD In five of those polls Giuliani has garnered greater numbers PERIOD

He is the only Republican who consistently beats Clinton in opinion polls PERIOD He has by far the greatest chance of winning and lets not be fooled by the fact that Dobson couched his ultimatum in terms of any candidate in both parties PERIOD He was talking about Giuliani PERIOD Dobson has no room for dissent in the Republican Party PERIOD There should be an abortion litmus test for candidates PERIOD He doesnt want any place for independent thought or respectful disagreement PERIOD

So lets say Giuliani is nominated and Dobson swings three percent of would be Giuliani voters to a third party candidate and Giuliani loses to Clinton  percent to  percent with three percent voting for an unnamed third party prolife candidate PERIOD What has Dobson accomplished I guess hes shown that hes a big man that wont compromise and will cut off his nose to spite his face PERIOD

The truth of the matter is that since the initial Roe v PERIOD Wade decision in  presidents have done little to affect the place of abortion in society PERIOD In the Ronald Reagan and George H.W PERIOD Bush years there were restrictions placed on public funding for abortions PERIOD In the Bill Clinton and George W PERIOD Bush years restrictions were placed on lateterm abortions PERIOD Theres not really much besides that PERIOD

I guess presidents can nominate strict or loose interpretationists to the Supreme Court but wouldnt Clinton be more likely to appoint a nominee who would expand abortion rights as opposed to limiting them Surely Giulianis appointee wouldnt be any MORE prochoice than Clintons PERIOD Its fine to stand for something but in the words of Reagan an individual far more revered by conservatives than Dobson Id rather get  percent of what I want than go off the cliff with my flag flying. option Evil

Dobson has a Ph.D PERIOD from the University of Southern California PERIOD Hes not stupid PERIOD And in the 1980s and 1990s when he had a wider younger base of support he wasnt as obnoxious PERIOD

Life has to be hard for a public figure who used to hold the fortunes of politicians in his hands when he ceases to be important PERIOD Maybe Dobson has a little of the Al Gore Syndrome where he wants to walk down the street and scream to whoever is listening Im still relevant but instead just makes a movie that does about the same thing PERIOD Only instead of making a movie Dobson has decided to launch a coup de grace and try to swing a presidential election PERIOD

If thats the case Dobson is an egomaniacal hack who has ruined lives and reputations for personal gain PERIOD Whether he is a fool or a hypocrite I dont know PERIOD What I do know is that for the good of themselves their beliefs and the Republican Party prolifers need to vote for the Republican candidate PERIOD Otherwise they might as well just vote for Clinton PERIOD
