Sam Scinta speaks to the crowd PERIOD

Sabrina Miresse Staff ReporterFebruary  

La Crosses community discussion group .Be. lead residents in conversation regarding the United States divided nation Thursday February ninth at Hackberrys Bistro PERIOD Walking into the open room participants were instantly prompted to write their names on a name tag PERIOD This set a welcoming atmosphere from the start and showed that the meeting was so much more than a speech about American politics PERIOD It was a group of residents coming together to share a meal and to learn how to engage in active conversation while still respecting those whose viewpoints do not align with their own PERIOD

Frequent meeting attendee Courtney Lokken stated that .Be PERIOD creates a safe environment for people to come together and talk about tough topics. further explaining that the gatherings tend to be less political and more philosophical PERIOD .Be PERIOD puts forth the hopeful what if questions and aims to build optimism within the community PERIOD

.Be PERIOD had invited Yale graduate Sam Scinta to start off the night PERIOD Heavily involved in the La Crosse community Scinta manages writing programs at local high schools as well as lectures at Viterbo and UWL PERIOD His education focuses on political theory and American government truly shined in the delivery of his speech at the Bistro PERIOD Scinta spoke about the passion of his goals for residents to build mutual respect for one another and to find common values through active citizenship PERIOD We is the most important word in American politics and weve lost common interest in society he spoke regarding our nations current state PERIOD

I dont think its ever bad for people to be engaging in these conversations La Crosse native Emily Tope shared her experiences coming to the .Be PERIOD meetings PERIOD And this was exactly what occurredparticipants broke into randomized small groups and had the chance to engage closely with one another in guided conversation PERIOD

Individuals were asked questions such as has this recent election broken or rebuilt any relationships in your life or what can we do as a community to move forward The six others passed ideas and compromised on various topics PERIOD In one small group there was a woman from Jerusalem and a woman from Nicaragua PERIOD The experiences of these two women put a spin on the groups conversation PERIOD This led to brainstorming ways on how to unite as a community and a nation the main concept being to get out and meet new people PERIOD

When we make people abstract we turn strangers into enemies PERIOD However when we make them concrete strangers become friends key note speaker of .Be PERIOD proposed to the room PERIOD Creating name tags at the start of this event encouraged a concrete view of the people around us PERIOD Getting to know one another as individuals and not as differing political agendas seemed to make the conversations genuine PERIOD It was recommended that this sincerity is one UWLs campus may need to work towards PERIOD The .Be PERIOD group is set to meet again in April PERIOD
