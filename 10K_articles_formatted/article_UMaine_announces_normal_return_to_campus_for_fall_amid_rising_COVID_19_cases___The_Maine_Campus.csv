UMaines Student Newspaper since  PERIOD



Amid rising COVID19 cases the University of Maine announced that many classes will resume in person starting in the fall  semester PERIOD On March  Chancellor Dannel P PERIOD Malloy sent an email to the UMaine community stating that everything will resume as normal in the fall  semester PERIOD



Im happy to let you know that we are announcing later this morning that we expect to welcome our students faculty and staff back to our university campuses this fall to safely resume the most traditional inperson college experiences we all took for granted before the pandemic Malloy wrote in the email PERIOD



Malloy stated that because of the increased availability of vaccines and the push to relax COVID19 safety measures by the start of next semester there is reason to believe that everything on campus could function as normal in the fall PERIOD The warmer weather in the spring and summer will also allow for more outdoor activities and less congregation of people indoors in spaces like restaurants which will provide outdoor seating in the summer months PERIOD



Malloy did stress that safety is always the top priority and shared that wearing face masks and maintaining a social distance of six feet will be key to keeping the UMaine campus on the right track PERIOD Although there were mentions of testing every UMaine community member who is eligible through graduation nothing was said about testing students who are returning in the fall PERIOD It is unclear if it will be done or who would qualify for potential testing PERIOD



With Gov PERIOD Janet Mills recent acceleration of the COVID19 vaccine timeline people are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel for this pandemic PERIOD All Maine residents ages  and older are eligible for vaccination beginning April  PERIOD If students can get vaccinated over the course of this semester and the summer the UMaine community hopes to be more protected from COVID19 concerns in the fall PERIOD



However in the past week the UMaine administration has taken a stricter and less hopeful approach to the situation regarding the pandemic PERIOD Vice President for Student Life and Inclusive Excellence and Dean of Students Robert Dana and President Joan FerriniMundy shared a message to the UMaine community on March  PERIOD



While our spirits lift its important that we remain vigilant of the health and safety guidance that has successfully gotten us to this point PERIOD We are still in a pandemic PERIOD And we have only eight weeks to go to finish this semester which we would like to do by continuing the inperson and campusbased instruction and activity we have been able to do this semester Dana and FerriniFundy wrote PERIOD



Although a number of new COVID19 cases have stemmed from collegeage individuals in the state of Maine the University of Maine System has reported  active cases of COVID19 in the entire system as of March  PERIOD These numbers are certainly not ideal but with the rise of vaccine availability and the community taking proper precautions an inperson fall  semester is still on the table PERIOD



On par with relaxing restrictions and resuming normalcy the UMaine administration allowed sports like baseball and softball to resume as well as pushed the football season to this spring PERIOD However seven members from the baseball team are now in quarantine due to exposure to a COVID19 positive person within the program PERIOD As a result the team had to cancel its weekend baseball games against Stony Brook University PERIOD It is unclear if other games will go on as planned and the baseball team like all other sports teams is being tested for COVID19 twice a week PERIOD



Our student athletes have modeled safe practices this year and we are proud of what they have accomplished in competition and in the effort to limit the spread of infection FerriniMundy shared in a press release sent on March  PERIOD



It appears that the last eight weeks of the spring semester are crucial to defining the trajectory of the university next fall PERIOD With the reading days and a minibreak fast approaching students are encouraged to make safe choices in the coming days PERIOD University staff and students alike must stay vigilant with COVID19 protocol even as the weather gets warmer and more vaccines are available PERIOD
