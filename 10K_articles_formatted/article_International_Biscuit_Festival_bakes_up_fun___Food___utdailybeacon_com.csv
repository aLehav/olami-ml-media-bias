Biscuit Festival sees homemade and restaurant style biscuits PERIOD See Original photo PERIOD

The International Biscuit Festival cooked up entertainment in Knoxville on Friday and Saturday for over  people to celebrate the food and fun biscuits bring PERIOD

Event Director Lindsey Collins said the festival has seen exponential attendance growth since its beginning PERIOD The increase came as a surprise and caused problems in recent years Collins said PERIOD

It started very small so the growth kind of set us back PERIOD Last year for instance we had a lot of hangups with vendors unexpectedly cancelling but mostly running out of biscuits because of the crowds PERIOD This year I think we really learned from those mistakes and this year it has almost been unsettlingly seamless Collins said PERIOD

Collins said that while attendance increase was surprising the reason people were attending was not so surprising PERIOD

People just really love biscuits Collins said PERIOD I know my team and I feel pretty proud of our success PERIOD Everyone seemed to get a biscuit and that is our goal. peter Olson who attended the event for the first time said he was anxious about the crowds but happy he attended PERIOD

At first I was really annoyed by all the people because Im not really into crowds but I got there early so the lines werent bad at all PERIOD Overall I thought it was really fun and delicious said Olson PERIOD

Collins said that running out of biscuits and long lines are a problem for any festival but that International Biscuit Festival organizers make efforts to minimize the problem PERIOD

Like any festival items are going to sell out quick but we have worked to prevent this by giving our vendors a strict thousand biscuit policy PERIOD This means that each vendor which attends the nonprofit event for free are required to bring at least a thousand of their biscuits for attendees Collins said PERIOD

While biscuit tourists filled their stomachs they were able to attend any of the numerous events taking place at the festival PERIOD Some of these events included demonstrations a biscuit baking contest a biscuit songwriting competition and the Miss or Mr PERIOD Biscuit pageant PERIOD

During the biscuit baking contest student biscuits savory biscuits sweet biscuits and special biscuits were judged by renowned food writers and biscuit connoisseurs PERIOD The creator of the Hardees biscuit was among the variety of judges for the competition PERIOD

For eight years locals and other biscuit lovers have professed their dedication to the breakfast side by composing songs filled with biscuit related lyrics PERIOD

The songwriting competition is just a silly event that plays into our Flatbed Music Stage which plays music throughout the entire day but I would have to say that its a favorite of all our attendees Collins said PERIOD

The Miss or Mr PERIOD Biscuit pageant a contest for anyone with a unique biscuit talent is the most competitive beauty race in the biscuit biz PERIOD

Its a silly excuse for people to come dress up and have a good time while sharing their biscuit talents PERIOD We are very loose on what constitutes a biscuit talent because we want people to be creative and have fun Collins said PERIOD

Collins and other festival organizers along with sponsors and vendors realize the uniqueness of the event and work yearround to host this special celebration of one of the Souths most prominent foods PERIOD

At the end of the day its not about the biscuits PERIOD Of course we want to feed the people and interact with the community and people travelling across the world to be a part of this extraordinary experience PERIOD Ultimately though we do this to profit Knoxville and really bring attention to our amazing city Collins said PERIOD
