Judge not.. PERIOD

To the students faculty and staff of UNL so quickly we are to judge something we know little about PERIOD

This fall semester Ive been confronted with several instances of discrimination concerning sexual orientation PERIOD In just the last few days Ive had to face this display of bigotry in a lecture hall at the Husker football game on a KRNU talk show and most recently walking to class PERIOD

The hateful epithets written on our sidewalks are another clear reminder of the lack of unity we have on campus PERIOD Everyone is affected by the different forms of oppression PERIOD Without respect for one another our individuality suffers PERIOD Hate breeds negativity and inhibits us all PERIOD

Education is the key to understanding PERIOD Fortunately for us we belong to an institution of higher learning PERIOD So to the people making slanderous comments on another minority try being inclusive with your thoughts PERIOD

Before judging others do our community a favor and educate yourself PERIOD

Sin sin sin

I am getting tired of hearing people condemn homosexuality on the basis that it does not help continue the species and is therefore contrary to natural law PERIOD By that argument celibacy is also a sin and priests and nuns are no less  than gays PERIOD

Bad hosts

As a journalism student at this university I am embarrassed and disappointed by the actions of the students who host the  show which airs on our colleges radio station PERIOD

As a bisexual woman I am hurt and angry PERIOD I have to ask myself how can I exist in a field where ignorant radio announcers encourage homophobes to act out by providing the means in this case chalk to write hateful messages against me One of the hosts of the show claimed in Wednesdays DN that he told the counterchalkers  In my mind homophobia equals hate and hate is derogatory PERIOD There is no denying this PERIOD

As journalists our job is to represent what goes on around us to keep people informed and hopefully to contribute to positive changes PERIOD Im hoping to see a resistance to irresponsible and damaging statements made in the name of journalism PERIOD

I expect these issues will be discussed in journalism classes and every class for that matter so that our collective point of view can expand and so that our work can improve PERIOD Professors and students Please remember that there are nonstraight students in your classes PERIOD We deserve to feel comfortable here PERIOD I think youll find that any efforts made to address these concerns will be met with appreciation and enthusiasm PERIOD Start today PERIOD

Come out

The antigay sentiments expressed were an ignorant and childish way of sharing the opinions of the chalkers who are equally ignorant offensive and hurtful PERIOD

Gay and lesbian students are a minority on campus PERIOD This week offers these students a chance to feel welcome and equal PERIOD It is a celebration of their courage PERIOD

I was shocked to read  It displays an opinion that is uneducated PERIOD This kind of hate speech should not be tolerated PERIOD As many of us know in the past couple of years people on campus have had to  some very horrible displays of discrimination PERIOD Many of us have spoken out against these hate crimes often to an unsympathetic community PERIOD

Minority students will tell you that they do not feel equal welcome or safe PERIOD They will tell you that crimes of discrimination and hate continue PERIOD It seems impossible to punish these crimes unless serious physical injury is involved and even then they may go unpunished and certainly they are not prevented PERIOD Remember the murders of Francisco Renteria and Tina Brandon Gaybashing should not exist on a university campus or anywhere for that matter PERIOD It should be considered a crime however it is not PERIOD Perhaps the persons responsible for hate speech on campus were not afraid of getting in trouble PERIOD I want the persons responsible to  accept the responsibility and claim their hateful opinions PERIOD Are they afraid Are they cowards After all they are entitled to their opinions right I dare these people to admit to their ignorant uneducated bigoted and hateful beliefs PERIOD And furthermore I dare them not to be white fraternity members PERIOD
