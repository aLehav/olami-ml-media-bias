Freedom of choice PERIOD Thats one of the great things about living in a

democratic society PERIOD People having the ability to hear both sides of an

issue PERIOD Unfortunately there are some on this campus who do not believe in

free choice PERIOD There is a new charge on campus being led by a small group of

grad students PERIOD They delight in secrecy and want to encourage grad students

to make uniformed and illadvised choices PERIOD These grad students are seeking

to deconstruct the current democratic system by which graduate students are

represented on this campus PERIOD Supposedly they want to provide better outlets

for grad student representation on campus PERIOD However their intent could

destroy the representative rights of grad students PERIOD

At the crux of this argument is the  of the Graduate

Student Association GSA PERIOD I agree that the GSA needs to be improved PERIOD

Better grad student involvement creation of more programming and

strengthening ties with the UT administration are all things that could be

improved upon PERIOD Yet the GSA has done great things for the grad student body

UPSF Travel Fund computer labs in married housing landlordtenant forums

fund raising for our library system yearly lobbying efforts etc PERIOD The list

goes on and on PERIOD The GSA has been a functioning supportive and open body

for over  years on this campus PERIOD Through its affiliation with the Student

Government Association the GSA has been able to help grad students in big

and small ways PERIOD The system is not perfect PERIOD I dont think any system is ever

perfect PERIOD When things are not perfect one works to make them better PERIOD But to

disregard the work and impact of the GSA is senseless PERIOD Especially when the

GSA president has done very little this year in terms of addressing grad

student issues PERIOD In fact the president has been heard at several meetings

saying  to know grad student issues PERIOD Perhaps then

the ineffectiveness of the GSA speaks more to poor leadership than anything

else PERIOD

Ironically the GSA president is the spearhead of this newly formed group

called the Graduate Student Council GSC PERIOD Now I am all for change and if

creating a new body to bring about true change is needed then so be it PERIOD

However creating a new committee in order to hide poor leadership or some

personal issue is ridiculous PERIOD The GSC proposes to eliminate the need for

grad student involvement with SGA and Student Affairs PERIOD The GSC wants to

focus on handling grad student issues through the graduate school PERIOD More

importantly the GSC wants their group to be  for grad students PERIOD

Thats all well and good PERIOD The graduate school provides activities that

assist graduate students such as fellowships and workshops PERIOD However I

wonder how this new alliance would go about dealing with a parking issue a

transportation issue or better yet Travel Fund While I do not doubt the

ability of the graduate school to handle extracurricular students issues

its main purposes seems to be academics  not VolConnection ticket

distribution health care or any of the other issues grad students have

expressed over the past few years PERIOD

I challenge every grad student to hear both sides of this issue for himself

or herself PERIOD There is going to be a general assembly Thursday in the UC

Shiloh Room at  p.m PERIOD Please you owe it to your academic and personal

success here at UT to attend PERIOD The manner in which you are represented

within this university is at stake PERIOD The only way you can have an impact is

to attend PERIOD Whether you believe in GSA or GSC or something altogether

different the time to speak is now PERIOD Your freedom of choice is being

violated and unless you take a stand it may disappear PERIOD Some people hope

you dont attend so they can continue to push forward their agenda without

debate PERIOD That could prove detrimental to your ability to voice grievances to

the University and serve within the university itself PERIOD I would hope that

every graduate student cares about his or her time spent at UT PERIOD Whatever

idea you have on the issue please come to general assembly and speak out PERIOD

If you keep silent now you could very well remain silenced forever as a

grad student at UT PERIOD
