The restaurant which was started in  in an industrial neighborhood on the north side of town is planning to open a new branch in downtown WinstonSalem on the corner of Sixth Street and Trade Street PERIOD

I wanted to open up a new place downtown because I saw the opportunity of the new location after having watched downtown grow so much said Mark Flynt the owner of Pulliams Barbeque PERIOD Its a really good place to have a business because of all the activity downtown PERIOD The events the music on Trade and the Arts District all attract a lot of people. flynt said that his restaurant used to be in a prime location back in the day when it was northeast of Whitaker Park where the old cigarette factories of Reynolds Tobacco Company used to be and east of the Piedmont Triad Airport PERIOD

These businesses attracted crowds of people to the north side of town PERIOD However the closing of Piedmont Airlines and the closing of the Reynolds Tobacco plants on Reynolds Boulevard has made business on the north side a little slower PERIOD

Things on the north side of town where my location is now just arent like what the use to be and theres just not a whole lot of draw businesswise in this location anymore Flynt said PERIOD We hope we can reach even more people in the new location. the renowned food attracts all different types of people PERIOD

In the restaurant you see people dressed in anything from business suits to blue jeans and work boots all chatting with each other while they eat their hot dogs and barbecue at the standup bar PERIOD

Ive been coming up to Pulliams for  years said Mike Newsome a retired WinstonSalem police officer who lives in Advance N.C PERIOD I just love the barbecue PERIOD Its just a stomping ground and I love coming up here and reminiscing about the times I use to come here when I was a kid. flynt will continue to cook barbecue and hot dogs at the current location while his daughter Caitlin who currently works with him will move downtown to run the new restaurant location PERIOD

The new location Flynt says will run very similarly to the original location definitely offering hot dogs and potentially offering barbecue fries and hamburgers PERIOD The final menu is still in the works PERIOD

Although barbecue is in the title of the restaurant over the years Pulliams Barbeque has received a lot of press for its hot dogs PERIOD

We sell about a dozen hot dogs to one barbecue Flynt said PERIOD Thats the reason why we want to get away from calling the restaurant Pulliams Barbeque and just call it Pulliams. ive read a couple article reviews about us and several people have said they dont know why its called Pulliams Barbeque because its really about the hot dogs. in  Pulliams received national recognition for its hot dogs when they were featured in Rachel Rays Magazine as Best Hotdog in the South. in June of this year MSN News ranked Pulliams in the Top  of Americas Top  Best Hotdogs. the restaurant has also been locally featured on Local Eats as one of the best restaurants to eat in WinstonSalem and received high reviews on websites such as TripAdvisor as a good place to eat at while visiting WinstonSalem PERIOD Numerous food bloggers have also raved about the food and oldschool style dining. flynt says he thinks that these great reviews are thanks to him and his family who all work in the restaurant creating a friendly environment and trying their best to make everyone feel welcome PERIOD

My dad brought me up with the saying that everyone puts their pants on the same no matter who they are Flynt said PERIOD So my daughter Caitlin and I just try to meet everyone who walks through the door and joke with them cut up and try to learn their interests PERIOD Ive always said its kind of like a hairdresser who listens to peoples problems and not solve it for them but just be there for them and show interest in them. as far as deciding how to decorate the new restaurant Flynt says he wants to get the downtown community involved PERIOD The NASCAR presence in the area had contributed to his theme in the current restaurant and he says he will probably use the same theme in the new restaurant but is open to suggestions from the downtown community PERIOD However the standup style dining will definitely still remain the same PERIOD

Our saying has always been If you can stand up you can eat more Flynt said PERIOD
