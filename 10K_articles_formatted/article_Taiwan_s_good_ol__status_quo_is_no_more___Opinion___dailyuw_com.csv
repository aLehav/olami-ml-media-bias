On March   the 51yearold status quo governing relations in the Taiwan Strait came to an end PERIOD For the first time an outspoken advocate of independence gained power and Maos old ideological opposite the Kuomintang lost the control itd had over the Republic of China since before its withdrawal to Taiwan PERIOD

The party that rules Taiwan now does not advocate or pay lip service to unification as the Kuomintang did PERIOD On the contrary the new ruling partys charter calls for the establishment of a Republic of Taiwan as opposed to China and an immediate vote for independence PERIOD Although the new president of Taiwan Chen Shuibien has modified his stance against outright independence because of Chinese saber rattling it is possible that this change in the political winds could turn into a tsunami the likes of which can crush economies landscapes and peoples PERIOD

Take for example new Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu PERIOD Some could call her an independence extremist PERIOD She has made it publicly clear that she opposes her own presidents shift from independence PERIOD In  she embarrassed former U.S PERIOD President Jimmy Carter on a visit to Taiwan by demanding that he apologize to Taiwan for recognizing the PRC in  as the one and only official China PERIOD Beijing calls her scum and vilifies her statements especially when she claimed that Taiwanese and Chinese were only distant relatives PERIOD

Now imagine if President Chen were to pass away by some unfortunate incident like say a bullet flying through his head and Vice President Lu was to assume power PERIOD You can bet that under circumstances of this sort there would be a war sparked by Lus declaration of Taiwanese independence PERIOD As U.S PERIOD citizens this affects each and every one of us PERIOD

A war in the Taiwan Strait would be a war the U.S PERIOD government could not afford to ignore PERIOD If we couldnt avoid getting involved in a Balkan war that posed no survival threat to our interests then there is no chance we would stay clear of a war that threatened vital shipping lanes a friendly country in a democratic transition and U.S PERIOD commercial interests PERIOD If Chinese missiles fell on Taiwan there would be a flood of Taiwanese refugees into the United States and Congress would have a Chinabashing field day PERIOD

But why is the status quo finished one might ask PERIOD Cant Taiwan and China just get along The answer to this lies in the roots of the Taiwan Question the Chinese Civil War which ended in  PERIOD Read any newspaper article and youll see that China has claimed Taiwan since its victory in  PERIOD What they usually omit is that Taiwan also claimed China for much of this time PERIOD

This fact created a relatively stable situation with a lot of colorful rhetoric to keep politicians on both sides entertained PERIOD Both sides claimed they were China so there was little threat of an independence war leaving Mao free to ravage his country and Taiwan free to develop its economy PERIOD

The status quo was rattled in  when the United States withdrew diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and ended its security treaty but Taiwans government still claimed to be China so PRC officials didnt feel pressured to reunify with Taiwan PERIOD

And then the 90s happened PERIOD Taiwans independence party was first legalized then came into power leading China to a troubling conclusion reunification might not be a foregone conclusion PERIOD China is still committed to the Civil War while Taiwan has finally moved on PERIOD

For  years reunification was a possibility if a remote one PERIOD On March  reunification went the way of the dodo PERIOD From now on the United States China and Taiwan will have to rethink their positions as that comfortable old status quo comes to an end PERIOD hideshow httpuseragentshow Previous article Next article Copyright2000 The Daily University of Washington
