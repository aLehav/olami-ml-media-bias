8148,2020-11-10,"club sports are a vital part of the colleges athletic community PERIOD They provide a wide array of less involved but still competitive opportunities for studentathletes at a range of experience and skill levels PERIOD When it comes to The Students sports section club teams live in the shadow of varsity teams which constitute a vast majority of our collegewide coverage PERIOD In light of this we checked in with representatives from several different club teams to learn about the experience of being on a club sports team particularly amidst the current pandemic PERIOD

Kate Redmond  a member of the womens ultimate frisbee team provided insight about how the team functions PERIOD She explained that the team receives a club budget to manage their operations with the option to ask the Association of Amherst Students AAS for additional funding if necessary PERIOD Regarding the experience of being a member of the team Redmond extolled the value of being part of a community I joined late in the fall last year because some of my friends were joining the team but I stayed because I loved the people. the team has a number of traditions one of which Redmond referred to as dirty Val. after practice players would head to Valentine Dining Hall for a meal still wearing their postpractice clothes while ignoring the judgement of onlookers PERIOD The teams name Sparkle Motion is a reference to the  film Donnie Darko which Redmond said the team watches annually PERIOD Like all activities at Amherst this year womens ultimate frisbee has been impacted by Covid19 PERIOD Most upperclassmen team members are not on campus this semester so sophomores like Redmond have had to step into leadership roles PERIOD In addition games have been cancelled and practices have to adhere to social distancing protocols but Redmond expressed a positive outlook Its hard not being able to actually play games but its a great time to teach people the basics PERIOD We cant wait for the whole team to be together next year. we also spoke with Sirus Wheaton  a member of mens club soccer PERIOD He explained that the teams budget is primarily used for equipment and transportation with the option to request additional funding PERIOD Recently the team received approval for funding to replace equipment  balls cleats and pinnies  that was lost during last springs evacuation from campus due to Covid19 PERIOD

Wheaton expressed a strong attachment to the team PERIOD He remarked club soccer has become my family PERIOD I live breathe and eat with them and I dont know what I would have done without the team. wheaton noted the value of the lighthearted environment which he contrasted with negative experiences playing soccer in high school PERIOD

Describing his favorite memory of the team Wheaton recalled a tense moment in the second game he played PERIOD As the final minutes dwindled Wheaton who had left the game with an ankle injury watched as his team made a last ditch effort to win the game PERIOD Off a wellplaced cross fellow team member Martin Wilkinson  nailed a midair slice to score the gamewinning goal PERIOD We erupted with joy and I have never seen Martin smile that big PERIOD I swear I could see his wisdom teeth PERIOD That was one of my best days and moments at Amherst Wheaton said PERIOD This semester Covid19 has forced the team to rely on technical passing practices with players even avoiding touching the ball with their hands PERIOD Certainly team members are looking forward to an eventual return to typical practices and games PERIOD

In addition Zoe Levin  shared her experience as a member of the womens rowing team PERIOD So far her favorite moments with the team have been the water practices on the river PERIOD I remember watching beautiful sunsets on my boat and riding together in the vans to and from the boathouse Levin remarked PERIOD

As is the case for every team on campus Covid19 has hindered the rowing teams ability to practice PERIOD Members are currently not allowed to go to the boathouse or row on the water which has forced the team to shift the focus of their preparation to conditioning PERIOD Levin also noted that the separation between oncampus and offcampus students has somewhat disturbed team unity PERIOD Despite the current setbacks Levin was unwavering in her support of the team Rowing is one of my favorite aspects of Amherst PERIOD I love the team and feel so connected to the culture of the students who row here PERIOD I am so thankful to have that on campus. caleb Beebe  discussed his time on the mens rugby team PERIOD Rugbys funding he explained comes almost entirely from the AAS PERIOD According to Beebe rugby alumni occasionally designate donations specifically for the rugby team which the administration uses to maintain the rugby fields rather than allowing the team to direct the funds PERIOD Beebe said that the rugby team is attempting to establish a separate fund for rugby alumni donations which would enable them to control how the money is spent PERIOD The majority of the teams annual budget is spent on their coachs salary but Beebe noted that the budget supplied by AAS makes it difficult to pay a rugby coach at a competitive rate PERIOD Some of the funds are also used to pay for equipmentsuch as uniforms balls and pads PERIOD

Echoing the other club sport athletes Beebe praised the sense of community that exists around the team PERIOD What I love most about the rugby team is the academic geographic and racial diversity of the program PERIOD Were a group from incredibly different backgrounds and we all have the amazing opportunity to learn from each other both on and off the field Beebe said PERIOD

He added that his favorite team tradition is their homecoming game against bitter rival Williams College The game itself is always especially intense and the captains on both teams wager their bside jerseys on victory PERIOD The losing side turns over their jerseys until the next year so a victorious Amherst captains greatest pride is wearing a Williams jersey around campus. in a typical year the rugby team relies on their coach and upperclassmen to teach the sport to new players PERIOD Due to Covid19 the team has no coach this year and most upperclassmen are living off campus which has impeded the teams ability to hold effective practices PERIOD Despite these current issues Beebe maintained the value of his time on the rugby team Rugby has been a true highlight of my Amherst experience its become an incredible social and athletic outlet and the friendships Ive made through the team have defined much of my experience on campus. based on these studentathlete perspectives its safe to say that community and competition are key aspects of being on a club sports team PERIOD Even in a pandemic when typical practices and games are impossible there is still value in having the shared identity that club teams provide PERIOD By constructing these communities students at Amherst are able to stave off the isolation that otherwise seems so prevalent right now  creating bonds that will serve them well when competition returns PERIOD",Checking in with Amherst Club Sports,Amherst College
