The current relationship between administrators and graduate student workers is for all practical purposes a oneway road PERIOD About a week before each semester begins I receive a contract for a term appointment as a graduate instructor or a teaching assistant in the English department which I sign asis and return to the payroll department to be processed PERIOD In my three years here my employment conditions have never been negotiated with me PERIOD While I was advised on how to submit grades for my undergraduate students and how to manage a classroom effectively no one ever advised me of how I can approach the terms of my own employment PERIOD

The current relationship between administrative departments and individual graduate student workers is heavyhanded intimidating and barely discernible PERIOD To be sure I relay my personal experience as an expression of the contradictory aspects of my current autonomy as a graduate student worker PERIOD

More fundamentally I support the union from the conviction that a collective approach allows the expression of authentic individuality whereas an individualistic approach denotes a failure of the group to care for its members PERIOD Even if certain individuals find a way to negotiate their employment terms and salaries I view this as a systematic failure because the majority of individuals will remain in the dark about the process PERIOD

The current administrative relation to graduate student workers is an indication of capitalisms logic of the free competing individual PERIOD

Like many others I dedicate my attention to advanced graduatelevel studies not to regurgitate the logic of a system that can only deepen my separation but to learn how to think in a way that seeks to grasp the genuine refreshing autonomy that can only be brought about collectively PERIOD

The unionization of graduate student workers seems to me to be at heart a basic expression of our intellectual and practical need to be recognized and to recognize each other PERIOD
