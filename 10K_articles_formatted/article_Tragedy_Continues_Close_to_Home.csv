An aneurysm does not have to be a lifethreatening condition today PERIOD Once diagnosed it can be monitored and controlled PERIOD If it poses risk to the patient doctors can perform a simple medical procedure and prevent the aneurysm from bursting PERIOD

Even though his aneurysm had been diagnosed months before earlier this year my great uncle had my grandmother hold his hand as she saw his heart rate trickle down until he passed in front of her eyes PERIOD Hospitals which until recently were performing the routine procedure that would have saved him turned him away because they did not have the necessary supplies to perform it PERIOD

Say hello to Venezuela PERIOD This South American country half the size of Texas is home to . million people has the longest Caribbean coastline on Earth and is the potential site of the next human tragedy PERIOD But how did it come to this Ordinary citizens lack access to basic medical care and services PERIOD And how could a great deal more attention not be directed at this actively collapsing state

In  the World Economic Forum ranked Venezuela dead last in judicial independence PERIOD Freedom Houses press freedom ranking calls the countrys press not free with only a handful of countries ranking worse such as Sudan Russia North Korea and China PERIOD Crime statistics are censored by the government but independent observers measured the yearly homicide rate to be  per  inhabitants placing it first globally next to Honduras PERIOD In the past  years  people have been murdered in the countrys streets with  percent of those homicides occurring last year PERIOD In my hometown of Caracas two people are killed every hour PERIOD

Even though Venezuela is less than  miles away from the United States southern border it seems media coverage about the ongoing crises in Venezuela extend only to 30second highlights once a week on CNN Fox News or MSNBC PERIOD Yet despite such a lack of attention dissecting where the countrys problems come from is actually simple Just look at the governance PERIOD

The oilrich country was never highly developed but since the Hugo Chvez regime took power in  the poverty rate rose to  percent and the minimum wage stands at an unsustainable  per month of which . are in cash and the rest are in food stamps PERIOD Chronic food shortages abound and medicine scarcity is severe PERIOD The Venezuelan people sick and starving have taken to rioting and looting to protest the situation PERIOD

Attempts to unseat the government by an opposition coalition have been unsuccessful PERIOD Last December Venezuelans elected opposition representatives to the National Assembly the legislative body by an unprecedented majority but every action the body has attempted has been annulled by the governmentcontrolled Supreme Tribunal of Justice PERIOD

Last week  million people dressed in white and carrying Venezuelan flags took to the streets peacefully to demand a recall vote to oust President Nicolas Maduro and millions have signed an official petition for the government to activate a recall process PERIOD Yet the existing government in collusion with the Election Commission continues to enact electionrigging policies to prevent any change including having public employees work just two days a week PERIOD With a constitutionally specified maximum number of business days to hold the recall vote the phrase  business days now means five months instead of just one PERIOD Not only are corrupt officials delaying the vote but if the president is recalled next year instead of this one his vice president according to constitutional law takes charge and the existing regime continues PERIOD

And things will not get better soon PERIOD The value of the bolivar currency continues to plummet food and medicine are becoming more scarce and expensive the country is still the tenth most corrupt on the planet PERIOD Uncertainty is endemic People fear how the government might react to further protests patients wonder about getting treatment and families do not know when they will eat next PERIOD

Geographically speaking Venezuela is closer to Washington D.C. than San Francisco is PERIOD An immense tragedy is happening in our backyard PERIOD If the Venezuelan people do not receive our support they at the very least deserve our attention PERIOD Stay tuned PERIOD
