Ian Korzeniecki  Evergreen womens soccer reporterNovember  

The bitterly cold weather was the perfect precursor to the inevitable result that ended the Washington State Cougars soccer season PERIOD

For the fourth year in a row the Cougars found themselves in overtime in the first round of the NCAA Tournament PERIOD The same result that met the Cougars the last two seasons met them again as Seattle U defeated the Cougars  in overtime PERIOD

With two minutes remaining in the second overtime period Seattle U redshirt sophomore Natasha Howe broke through the back line of WSU and put the ball where diving redshirt senior goalkeeper Gurveen Clair had no chance of saving it PERIOD One missed tackle and Howe was able to speed passed the Cougar defense and net the game winner PERIOD

Howe not only won the game for the Redhawks but also secured the first win in Seattle U program history in any Womens NCAA Tournament game PERIOD

In front of a fan base who braved the freezing temperatures the Cougars came out flat PERIOD SU was the aggressor from kickoff PERIOD Senior leader Nicole Setterlund did not play possibly due to a blow to the head she took against the Washington Huskies PERIOD

I want to congratulate Seattle PERIOD That is probably the first time in  games that our soccer was not good enough to win tonight Head Coach Steve Nugent said PERIOD That is on me as a head coach I need to do better to prepare out teams to play in tough environments like we had tonight PERIOD The standard is really high here at Washington State and the expectations are high when we get into these moments of the season tonight was no different PERIOD But I will say they fought back PERIOD They played hard. after numerous opportunities for the Redhawks they finally were able to score PERIOD In the thirty-third minute senior forward Stephanie Verdoia dribbled passed the Cougars last line of defense to slot the ball passed Clair PERIOD The goal was Verdoias twenty-second goal of the season PERIOD

I could not be more proud of this senior class this year Clair said fighting back tears from the emotions of the game PERIOD It is not a known that every year Washington State will make it to the tournament that is the type of program we have helped to develop PERIOD I am excited to be an alumni now and watch the team progress to another tournament. with ten minutes remaining in the match Washington State finally received the break they had been waiting for PERIOD Redshirt junior Beau Bremer flew down the sideline and crossed the ball into the box PERIOD The ball was mishandled by SU junior goalkeeper Brianna Smallidge and junior Mariah Powers was in the right place at the right time for the Cougars PERIOD Powers chested the ball into the net to tie the game at  PERIOD

We are a team that has come back from losing situations and felt that we do really well in those types of situations we went into the overtime with a lot of momentum senior midfielder Mesa Owsley said PERIOD We missed a few opportunities that we really needed to put in the back of the net PERIOD We had all the opportunities to win the game but Seattle U was able to execute on their one opportunity. the two overtime periods generated more scoring opportunities for the Cougars but the story remained true all year long PERIOD If Washington State hopes to advance farther next season they must find ways to capitalize on goalscoring opportunities PERIOD

We did not come into this with hopes of just being competitive Nugent continued PERIOD We were here to win PERIOD These kids are winners PERIOD When you looked out here today and the fan support under tough conditions was incredible PERIOD That is motivating. the Seattle U Redhawks advance to face South Carolina PERIOD The Cougars finish the year  PERIOD The results began to tail off at the end of the season PERIOD This can possibly be credited to some injuries to key players and unfortunate bounces PERIOD The last win for the Cougars came on Oct PERIOD  against Utah PERIOD

We will be back PERIOD I can promise you that that  percent we will be back Nugent said PERIOD
