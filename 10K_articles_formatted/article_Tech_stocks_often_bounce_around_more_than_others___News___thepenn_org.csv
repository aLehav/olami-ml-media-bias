Traders worked Tuesday at the New York Stock Exchange PERIOD

In a week of stock market volatility technology companies such as Apple Alphabet and Facebook saw some of the sharpest declines over the last few days PERIOD

Economists arent particularly worried or surprised though PERIOD

Thats because in shaky times technology stocks often take the first  and hardest  beating PERIOD

Most of their value is based on what they will become in the future said Lawrence Harris an expert in stocks who teaches at at USCs Marshall School of Business PERIOD And the future of course has not yet arrived. stock market volatility is tied to investor confidence Harris said PERIOD When investors are feeling bullish about a company or an industry they buy stock which drives up values PERIOD When investors feel pessimistic or skittish theyre more likely to sell PERIOD

When it comes to the technology industry where valuations largely rest on what companies might be able to accomplish in the future investor pessimism can lead to significant swings in stock price PERIOD

Facebook for example is a moneymaking machine PERIOD It made . billion in revenue during its  fiscal year PERIOD

Still its market cap is  billion  more than  times its annual revenue PERIOD To warrant such a valuation investors must believe that the company is capable of increasing its earnings by orders of magnitude in the coming years PERIOD

Or take Tesla which is not yet profitable and has a market cap of  billion PERIOD Its competitor Ford recorded . billion in profit during its last fiscal quarter and has a market cap of  billion PERIOD

So you basically have two companies of similar size  one makes lots of and lots of money and the other doesnt Harris said PERIOD And people are betting that Tesla is going to win. its common for people to oscillate between optimism and pessimism for any number of reasons Harris said and when they do tech firms are the worst hit because their values depend on uncertainties. harris and economist and USC instructor PaiLing Yin believe its what happens in the long run that matters and the best thing to do is to ride it out PERIOD After all even with recent wild fluctuations Apples current share price remains  percent higher at . a share than it was this time last year PERIOD And Alphabet despite experiencing its sharpest drop in stock price in the last  months this week is still trading at  percent higher at  a share than its value a year ago PERIOD

Looking more generally at investor pessimism of the stock market Harris said the volatility could serve as a warning of the consequences of a growing federal deficit PERIOD

Deficits can lead to crowding out which is when the government competes with the private sector for a limited amount of funds to finance its deficit spending PERIOD This can then drive up interest rates which can discourage investments and lower investments can lead to lower economic growth PERIOD

The president may not care about deficits and Congress may not care either but its clear businesspeople and investors care Harris said PERIOD
