7074,2021-03-13,"if you dont know Gary Johnson you wont learn much from the June  Republican debate PERIOD

CNN informed the Johnson campaign last week that the former New Mexico governor who announced his presidential candidacy in April would not be invited or allowed to participate PERIOD

Its rare that I agree with a campaign press release PERIOD But Johnsons campaign got it exactly right his exclusion from the debate amounts to media unfavoritism PERIOD

Admittedly Im more likely to be rankled by this than your average American Im a tentative supporter of Johnson PERIOD But in a field that is by all accounts wide open snubbing a candidate does both the public discourse and the American polity a disservice PERIOD

Johnsons early exclusion is a historical anomaly PERIOD Dark horses Mike Gravel and Alan Keyes were excluded from televised debates in the  race  but only later in the campaign PERIOD Both Duncan Hunter and Tom Tancredo were polling at  percent in August   but still attended CNNs Nov PERIOD  debate PERIOD

So why the difference CNNs exclusion of Johnson I suspect is based in journalistic discretion. the same kind of discretion that inflated Donald Trumps sham candidacy a flashy celebritystyle approach to politics that ranks spectacle over substance PERIOD

Johnson an unassuming man with a score of physical feats and gubernatorial vetoes under his belt lacks the star power of Sarah Palin PERIOD He doesnt have Mitt Romneys gigawatt smile or polling numbers PERIOD He cant measure up to the notoriety of unannounced presumed candidate Rick Santorum who is about even with Johnson in the polls PERIOD

Simply put if you prefer political theater to actual substance hes just not that interesting PERIOD And if the news media should know better they havent in quite a while PERIOD

The newspapers shout right along with their readers and seek to please when they ought simply to enlighten wrote French novelist Albert Camus during his days as an editor and editorial writer of the underground newspaper Combat PERIOD

Analogous perhaps to the breathless sensational coverage that accompanied Palin and Trumps pizza meeting last week PERIOD Or the giddy reporters enthusing over  Palins whirlwind bus tour CNN political reporter Peter Hamby helpfully explained the necessity of taking Palin seriously. cNNs snubbing of Johnson amounts to a disturbing new role for the network that of political gatekeeper PERIOD When media networks focus exclusively on highprofile candidates they reinforce the presence of those candidates in the mind of the American public PERIOD It would be difficult to argue that Johnson should be given equal coverage to the frontrunners but inclusion in debates  a medium for his message  should be taken for granted PERIOD

The argument for the defense is well known wrote Camus. We give the public what it wants. but this isnt what the public wants PERIOD Its what the public has been taught to want which isnt the same thing. camus could be speaking of todays major news outlets PERIOD If members of the media establish politics as a competitive spectacle an allstar sport the spectators will demand celebrity athletes PERIOD But democracy is not a spectator sport and it only functions when citizens are informed of all perspectives PERIOD

Including the perspectives of dark horse longshot candidates such as Johnson PERIOD",CNN hurts debate by excluding Johnson - The Daily Iowan,University of Iowa
