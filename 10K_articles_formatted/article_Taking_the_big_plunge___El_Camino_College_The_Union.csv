8683,2023-06-04,"fifteen years ago Wendell Perkins never imagined that his love for splashing in the water would carry him to the state championships PERIOD

He came here in the spring of  and after only one semester has proved that his love and dedication for what he considers a hobby is the driving force behind his success PERIOD

Diving has been a hobby of mine since I was twenty and up until now PERIOD Ive done it off and on the 35yearold Richmond Virginia native said PERIOD

However he said his enthusiasm for swimming began as young as  years old when he took his first leap off the diving board in a family pool PERIOD

In the short span that Perkins has been here he has managed not only to gain recognition in at least three major diving competitions but he also broke the colleges  dual meet record PERIOD

In the dual meet we do half dives and its one team against another so I ended up beating the old EC record of two hundred by fortyfive points Perkins said PERIOD

Not bad for a former teacher and coach who said hes probably received more awards and recognition for art than for diving. adding further to his repertoire of accomplishments Perkins took second place in the 3meter and third place in the 1meter diving at the recent state championships PERIOD

He won first place in the 1meter dive at the South Coast Tournament scoring a record . has been named diver of the year and is positioned in the Top  of the All American Divers PERIOD

I wasnt so sure if I would be allowed to dive in college because they have age restrictions in certain divisions but once I found out I could I was confident that I would win Perkins said PERIOD

He said being overconfident might have affected him negatively PERIOD  He said that being overconfident caused him to put forth less than his best effort PERIOD

But when it comes to having doubts about his performance Perkins said there are times when he has to do some dives that he feels uncomfortable about PERIOD His biggest fear is getting injured PERIOD

I get a bit shaken on certain dives and I think that was my downfall at the finals Perkins said PERIOD

My reverse dives are the ones that definitely terrify me because thats what I was doing when I hurt my hand on the board during training. however he said it will probably take doing those dives another  times before he realizes he has no reason to be scared PERIOD

When any diver stands on the boards it will look like he or she is completely confident but there is always one dive that they fear but youll never know it Perkins said PERIOD

Nonetheless swim coach Corey Stanbury said Perkins devotes a great deal of time and effort into his training both physically and psychologically PERIOD

He lives sleeps eats and breathes diving Stanbury said PERIOD

On the other hand Perkins said although he loves diving he is also interested in art sculpture and is studying science so that he can become a nurse PERIOD

Perkins said while he enjoys coaching and teaching being a nurse would allow him to help others and get paid more PERIOD

With the final competition behind him Perkins said he plans to maintain his standards by continuing his practice and looks forward to next year so that he can close the gap between him and his competitors PERIOD

As one of the best divers on the team Perkins looks forward to coming back and performing well PERIOD

Winning in a dive meet by ten points makes you wonder if you really won but if you win by twenty points then you know for sure that youve won Perkins said PERIOD

Diving will be something I will do as long as I can walk but Ill probably coach he said PERIOD  If I had it my way Id dive and make art all day. the student news site of El Camino College",Taking the big plunge - El Camino College The Union,El Camino College
