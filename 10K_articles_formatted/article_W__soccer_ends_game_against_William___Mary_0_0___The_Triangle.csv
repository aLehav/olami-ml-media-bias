9457,2011-10-07,"freshman midfielder Alyssa Findlay tries to make a goal on Buckley Field PERIOD This season the womens team has silenced the bad predictions by going  in conference play PERIOD The team is set to face William and Mary Oct PERIOD  in Williamsburg Va.Temperatures falling old sweaters making their way out of the storage bin and the lengthening night taking over from the shortening days PERIOD These three things can only mean the following in the city of Philadelphia One it is October two the Phillies are preparing to make another tilt at the World Series and three Drexel womens soccer is entering a crunch run of games that will impact their chances of earning one of the postseason spots in the Colonial Athletic Association PERIOD

Fourth from the top in the CAA standings  runaway leaders William and Mary   CAA sit atop  head coach Ray Goons side has upset one or two predictions PERIOD Picked to finish in the bottom of the conference by an earlyseason poll of the coaches Drexel has gone about putting together a run of performances that has been a marriage of flair and hard work PERIOD

A  start to the conference schedule that included resounding wins against Georgia State and UNC Wilmington saw the Dragons go into their first road conference game against Hofstra with confidence PERIOD

An early goal for the visiting side by forward Jenna Lindsay quickly pushed the home side onto the back foot PERIOD The assist for Lindsays goal went to Alex Vasquez with a long pass from midfield PERIOD

The response was swift from the Pride as a pass from Lulu Echeverry found Laura Green with time and space to dribble through Drexels defense and tie the game with a finish past Eve Badana in goal PERIOD With the score level and close to halftime a lightning storm resulted in the game being halted for  minutes for safety reasons PERIOD

Hofstra started better after the restart with Greene once again applying the finishing touch to a pass across the middle from midfielder Courtney Breen PERIOD Despite increased Drexel pressure on Kylie Shusters goal the match would end  with the spoils going to the Pride PERIOD

Their next match was against a resurgent Northeastern side and saw the Dragons return to the Vidas Athletic Complex where they boasted an impressive  record going into the Oct PERIOD  game PERIOD The home crowds eagerness to see a win was rewarded by a bright start to the game from the home side PERIOD

A quick interchange of passes saw the lively Jess Lowinger released down the left wing and a centered cross nearly found Alyssa Findlay in acres of space at the edge of the 18yard box PERIOD Northeastern did manage to clear the ball away hastily PERIOD

Drexel would soon be back as a sliderule pass from Findlay released topscorer Jenna Lindsay down the right wing her cross finding the forehead of her strike partner Vasquez who could only angle her header onto the upright PERIOD

Tiring legs for the Dragons saw Northeastern slowly start to eke out a share of the possession with forward Greta Samuelsdottir looking particularly dangerous when allowed space and time to run at Drexels back four PERIOD

Drexel managed to accrue a lot of possession without quite getting that final touch in the box to test the visiting goalkeeper PERIOD

The frustration from the home side soon drew its first casualty as a wild tackle from freshman Melissa Chapman saw the first yellow card of the day handed out to Drexel PERIOD

With three minutes to go the game took a turn for the bizarre as an innocuous ball into the box saw a Northeastern player hit the deck like a flounder at a Philadelphia fish market PERIOD To the amazement of the home crowd and the consternation of the home bench the referee saw it fit to award a penalty to the away side PERIOD Veronica Napoli stepped up to take the effort which was saved quite comfortably by Badana PERIOD

The save was a close call for the home side and a priceless play that would see the game go to the half without anyone troubling the scoreboard PERIOD

The second half started much as the first with Drexel dominating possession in dangerous areas of the pitch but lacking that poise in front of goal to score PERIOD A reverse pass by Vasquez put Lindsay in behind the Northeastern defense only for her thunderous effort to find the side netting PERIOD

It was to be the only real goalscoring opportunity of the second half as both teams showed their more physical attributes particularly in the  challenges PERIOD The referee dished out another caution this time to Northeasterns Lahaina Zoller PERIOD

Tied  at the end of regulation and for the second time this season Drexel would go into overtime looking to win PERIOD Their cause was aided again by a massive save from their freshman goalkeeper as a slip on the greasy surface allowed Napoli to get in behind for a one on one opportunity PERIOD Badanas reflexes come into the forefront again as she battered away the resultant shot PERIOD

 it would remain through to the end of overtime giving both sides a valuable result in a game that neither could afford to lose PERIOD

The Dragons next game Oct PERIOD  sees them take on conference leaders William and Mary on the road PERIOD Boasting  goals scored and only eight conceded in  games played the Tribe has only lost one game at home this season double overtime to Villanova and presents a huge challenge to a Drexel side that has yet to find its scoring touch away from home PERIOD

Junior Mallory Schaffer who has managed to rack up  goals and three assists in  games played this season will lead coach John Dalys side PERIOD She is ably aided by the duo of Emory Camper and Cortyn Bristol who have scored  goals between the two PERIOD Shackling this productive triumvirate will be a task that will fall to Drexels muchimproved defense led by goalkeeper Badana and redshirt junior Jourdan Halasz PERIOD

The Dragons continue their road schedule with a visit to Old Dominion   CAA Oct PERIOD  PERIOD The Lady Monarchs come into the game boasting an equal record as the Dragons at this early stage of the season PERIOD A  doubleovertime tie with George Mason saw Old Dominion bounce back for a quick twogame winning streak that took wins at home against Towson and UNCW PERIOD The Lady Monarchs most recent game ended in a fourgoal thumping at the hands of Georgia State on the road PERIOD Joe Pereiras side will be looking to return to winning ways at home PERIOD

As the conference table starts to take shape at this critical point in the season Drexel will be looking to get over its road hoodoo and finally pick up some points this weekend PERIOD With most teams in the conference struggling to win on the road anything the Dragons manage to pick up will count doubly come the end of the season PERIOD

Like any Philadelphia natives will tell you Philly teams come into their own as the cold October air drifts in off the Atlantic Ocean PERIOD Going into the weekend one hopes Goons side will be reminiscent of the  Phillies rather than Michael Vicks  Dream Team.",W. soccer ends game against William & Mary 0-0 - The Triangle,Drexel University
