The plan to overhaul the campuss east end includes the demolition of University Square so that a new multifaceted complex could be constructed in its place PERIOD Retailers who currently reside in University Square are not going to be compensated for their loss of space PERIOD Instead the propertys owner Executive Management has offered to try and help businesses find new retail space PERIOD

We need to find a place that is close by since at least  percent of our business comes from students said Deb Henry owner of Bakers Too PERIOD Were hoping to go across the street and we have expressed interest in coming back when the building is finished but there is no guarantee since our leases will be up PERIOD We also have to think about how much the new rent will be. the project will also affect the delivery of mail since much of downtown Madisons mail passes through University Squares branch of the U.S PERIOD Post Office PERIOD While the office is planning on returning to University Square after construction of a new complex is complete it has yet to find a space in which will be able to house facilities for the approximate  months it will be out of a home PERIOD

Its going to be a real problem for Madison mail a postal worker said PERIOD We havent found a suitable place and its going to be a real hardship for business owners and students who use us as their primary post office. construction of the new complex is tentatively set to begin in late  PERIOD

The general plan calls for  underground parking stalls two levels of retail space and approximately  beds of student housing PERIOD There are also plans to move student financial services  such as the bursar register and the financialaid office  as well as a studenthealth center and a studentactivities center into the new building PERIOD

This is one of the earlier parts of the development project but were still really excited about it said UW spokesman Dennis Champman PERIOD Student organizations have been asking for something like this for quite some time PERIOD It should be extremely convenient for everyone involved. in order to keep construction on schedule UW would have to allot for the funding in the  budget PERIOD Currently the estimates indicate the development would cost . million with . million from housing health studentactivities and parking revenue . million from the state and . million from the developer for the retail portion of the project PERIOD

Also included in the project are plans to unify the arts and humanities programs by tearing down the Humanities building and rehousing the school of music and art PERIOD

There are also plans to renovate and expand the Elvehjem Museum of Art providing musicperformance space and consolidating the art services which are spread all over campus PERIOD
