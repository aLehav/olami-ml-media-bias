Sophomore Stella Cliffe hits a forehand in her doubles match with partner Grace Summers PERIOD Cliffe and Summers won  PERIOD The womens tennis team does not have a player from Illinois but all agree the different backgrounds have helped them grow together PERIOD

Dillan Schofheide Womens Tennis ReporterApril  

Eastern is no stranger to international and outofstate athletes PERIOD

These athletes have made names for themselves as Panthers and have become key players for their respective teams PERIOD For example Grace Lennox the senior point guard on the womens basketball team is from Hobart Tasmania PERIOD

But no other team at Eastern can boast the same unique identity that the womens tennis team has not one player is from Illinois PERIOD

Every other athletic team at Eastern has at least one of its players from various parts of Illinois the mens golf team is close but senior Alex Gowin is from Charleston PERIOD

Four players from the womens tennis team are international players while the other five are from four different states PERIOD

Srishti Slaria a junior from Hyderabad India has the secondlongest trip to get home from the U.S PERIOD sophomore Stella Cliffe has to fly a couple hours longer to get back to Auckland New Zealand PERIOD

I dread the traveling part the most Slaria said PERIOD I usually take a direct flight home which is about  hours long PERIOD And as luck would have it I am a pathetic sleeper while traveling and so by the end of the journey I am so tired that I cant even think properly. not to mention Hyderabad is approximately  and half hours ahead of Charleston so Slaria said her sleep schedule is disrupted completely when she travels PERIOD

But playing with her teammates is an experience Slaria loves PERIOD Because everyone is from a different area she likes the different perspectives everyone has PERIOD

For me life is an amalgam of experiences and the more diverse the experiences the better and more challenging life she said PERIOD If everyone does things the same way then it will get boring. freshman Claire Martin agrees with Slaria and enjoys the diverse background each player has PERIOD

Both said they have gotten to learn about the different places everyone is from and Martin believes the diverse backgrounds helps the team PERIOD

I think by being from other countries and not all from the Midwest or somewhere nearby adds another aspect to the college experience Martin said PERIOD

Martin is from Chesterfield Missouri but she is able to have some common ground with junior Abby Carpenter who is from  minutes away in Wildwood PERIOD

The topic of our backgrounds comes up especially when its around a major break when people start going home she said PERIOD Also just in casual conversations someone will talk about something back from their home thats either similar to or different from here. hometowns are not the only differential between the players as sophomore Shelby Anderson from Lake Elmo Minnesota has another sport in her portfolio she played one year of hockey in high school PERIOD

Even though the athletes can share their backgrounds the difference in travel time will always be something only some of the players can relate to each other about PERIOD Freshman Rachel Papavasilopoulos who by car has approximately a 17hour ride home to Boca Raton Florida PERIOD

Even though it is a tiring journey Slaria loves going home when she can PERIOD

I keep joking my teammates that if I went back home for a long weekend holiday Id have to land and take off immediately in India to be back in time she said PERIOD
