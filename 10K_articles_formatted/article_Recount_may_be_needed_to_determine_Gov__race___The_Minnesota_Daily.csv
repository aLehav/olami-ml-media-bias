My administration is fully committed and prepared to accomplish the swift and orderly transition to the next governor as soon as a final determination is made Pawlenty said Wednesday in a statement.As required by Article V of the Minnesota Constitution I will continue to serve as Governor until a new governor takes the oath. the Minnesota Republican Party isready tofight for Emmers place at the table PERIOD Theyre more preparedthis time around than they were for the  Senate recount Chair Tony Sutton said in a press event PERIOD

Were not going to get rolled this timehe said PERIOD

The potential recount should move quickly due to ballot law changes and revamped voter tracking systems coupled with recent experience handling tight races Secretary of State Mark Ritchie said PERIOD

Inthe event thevote margin is abovethe necessary percentage the losing candidate can pay for a recount PERIOD

The Dayton campaign scheduleda press conference on the subjectfor  p.m PERIOD

DFLers were optimistic about Daytons chances to win earlyTuesday night when the former U.S PERIOD Senator had a doubledigit lead PERIOD Shortly before midnight Sen PERIOD Amy Klobuchar DMinn. addressed the crowd at the election night celebration and said Dayton would appear soon PERIOD

It looks incredibly good for Mark Dayton tonight Klobuchar said PERIOD

But Daytons margin which had narrowed over the course of the night slipped into dangerous territory for the DFL shortly following her speech PERIOD An announcement from Republican Party of Minnesota chairman Tony Sutton assured the fight was not over PERIOD

Representatives of the Republican Party stationed at the Hennepin County attorneys office reported ballots had been double counted meaning numbers posted by Secretary of State Mark Ritchie could be off by as many as  votes PERIOD

Back in the war room weve got the race for governor down to three points Sutton said PERIOD We cant trust the results coming in so were tracking them ourselves. this comes after an Election Day marked by efforts from officials and voters to avoid voter fraud and put the memory of the contested  Senate election behind them PERIOD

For University of Minnesota thirdyear Rebecca Doepke its been nervewracking. youre watching the election and Emmer is down and then you hear about the  vote swing and you just get that wave of hope back again Doepke said PERIOD

Republicans celebrated taking control of the U.S PERIOD House as well as big gains in the state Legislature PERIOD

Emmer addressed the crowd at about  a.m PERIOD

Its been a wonderful night all across the country and in the state of Minnesota for Republicans he said PERIOD Were not quite done here in Minnesota when it comes to the governors race. dayton appeared at about  a.m PERIOD to thank supporters for remaining PERIOD

Although he had little new information Dayton attempted to inspire hope PERIOD We are still here standing he said PERIOD

But steep legislative losses also flew in the face of earlier optimism PERIOD

House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher said she was confident in turning her authority over to a DFL counterpart PERIOD I think were bucking a trend in Minnesota she said PERIOD

Just hours later the Associated Press projected Republicans could regain control of the Minnesota House and Senate PERIOD

Betsy Hammer a student in the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs and a Dayton supporter called this a landmark election. there is such a big difference in the candidates this year its a pretty clear choice she said PERIOD

The three candidates platforms differed greatly throughout the campaign PERIOD Dayton said he would use income taxes on high earners to help chisel away at the states projected  billion budget deficit PERIOD Emmer opposed any new taxes saying he would instead cut state funding and reform government to fill the gap PERIOD Horner attempted to find a middle ground a position he emphasized at the candidates more than two dozen debates PERIOD

Independence Party candidate Tom Horner conceded the race shortly after  p.m PERIOD

Its been a great opportunity and a great honor to take on the mantle of the Independence Party he said PERIOD I do want to let whoever wins this race know Im certainly standing by ready to work with that person to build a better Minnesota. horner promised to continue the work his campaign started and said his supporters could celebrate a victory knowing they impacted the election PERIOD

I think what we really showed Minnesota is that there is a center to Minnesota politics he said PERIOD There are more Minnesotans who are eager to look beyond partisan interests to look beyond whether they are Democratic solutions or Republican solutions and start focusing on Minnesota solutions. horner supporter Dan Goldman said he hopes the next governor will borrow some of the principles Horner ran on specifically bipartisanship PERIOD

If anything its the idea that we can try and bridge the gap between the two parties to come to a consensus he said PERIOD

Former Minnesota Gov PERIOD Arne Carlson said whoever wins the governors race should take a close look at Horners budget proposal PERIOD

The Dayton numbers have never added up you cant get your way out of this pickle by taxing the rich. thats absurd Carlson said PERIOD The Emmer idea that were going to cut  billion  he knows darn well we cant do that. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
