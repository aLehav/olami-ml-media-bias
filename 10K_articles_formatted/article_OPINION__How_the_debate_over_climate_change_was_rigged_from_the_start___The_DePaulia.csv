Climate protesters in London outside of the Bank of England on April  PERIOD Organized by the group Extinction Rebellion the protestors disrupted the city for  days PERIOD

Climate change today is a highly political issue but it wasnt always that way  and it shouldnt be PERIOD Throughout the years big energy industries have been key players in constructing the platform of climate change denial and as their platform grew journalists felt more compelled to give deniers a voice in stories centered on climate change further contributing to public misunderstanding PERIOD

In an investigative piece by InsideClimate News reporters looked at notes from a  Exxon Mobil committee meeting where James F PERIOD Black then senior company scientist presented the dangers of releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by Exxons use of fossil fuels PERIOD At the time climate change and potential efforts to reduce impacts werent political or debatable at all PERIOD

Exxon acted promptly in  on this information by initiating a large scale research effort that looked at the impacts of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels PERIOD

For a while it looked like Exxon might have been the cutting edge leader in climate change research and based on their own findings may have changed the trajectory for what the future of their corporation would be PERIOD That is not what happened PERIOD

Instead when climate change started to enter the public conversation in  Exxon denied their earlier research findings and wasnt transparent with their shareholders PERIOD

Jill Hopke assistant professor in the journalism department whose work focuses on environmental communication said theres a reason that  was a turning point in bringing climate change into mainstream news coverage and public dialogue PERIOD

That was when NASA scientist James Hansen had actually addressed a congressional committee and he did so in the midst of a heat waveand a lot of what we think about climate is influenced by the weather that we experience she said PERIOD

Exxon began funding different groups to sow doubt about climate change science as it became a more recognizable issue and consequently the emerging deniers took to the media to voice their doubt creating an issue of false balance that continues to this day PERIOD

The concept of false balance relates to the journalistic norms and standards of remaining objective and always presenting both sides of the story PERIOD This has historically created a struggle for journalists covering climate change related stories since they often feel the need to apply balance and include the voice of a small group of scientists who dispute the majority  percent scientific consensus that climate change is human caused and will continue to have worsening impacts PERIOD

Presenting climate change as an issue that has two equal and opposing sides does not accurately portray the problem PERIOD Before fossil fuel industries started funding doubt campaigns coverage on climate change related stories was mainly covered by specialized science reporters covering scientific findings directly PERIOD

Then theres sort of this phase where its covered by science reporters but once the industry funded and industry backed doubt campaigns come into play theres a turn by journalists and they start consulting sources that are industry backed and are clearly trying to poke holes in the growing scientific consensus about anthropogenic climate change said Robert Eshelman an environmental reporter and adjunct professor at Columbia Universitys Graduate School of Journalism PERIOD

While the issue of false balance has recently gotten better in terms of media outlets addressing the  percent majority consensus and not giving undue time to deniers Eshelman said the greater challenges now are the established media outlets who still spread misinformation PERIOD

Its now an issue of youve got ideologically driven publications and television networks that continue to promote denial of climate changeand elected officials that deny climate change he said PERIOD

Elected officials and even the small group of scientists who actively work to create doubt about the scientific consensus are almost always funded by the fossil fuel industry PERIOD Oklahoma Sen PERIOD James M PERIOD Inhofe for example who infamously brought a snowball to the Senate floor as evidence that climate change is a hoax received nearly four hundred thousand dollars from oil and gas companies in campaign contributions PERIOD

If journalists still feel pressured to include the voice of climate deniers they can do so in a way that highlights the  percent scientific consensus and provide more information on where deniers receive funding from in order to give audiences a better understanding of denier motives PERIOD

Kaitlyn Pike sustainability coordinator for DePauls Student Government Association said as the scientific evidence continues to grow theres no longer a reason to provide a voice to deniers in news coverage at all since it creates an unjustified sense of comfort with inaction PERIOD

.ChuckTodd I like your program PERIOD But this critique is fair PERIOD Why didnt you have one of us on to discuss the report Many of us are practiced at media  appeared on other national news programs including MSNBC to provide the authoritative objective assessment viewers deserve PERIOD httpst.coxCIkHwi2na

 Michael E PERIOD Mann MichaelEMann November  



This false sense of uncertainty in whether humans have a role in climate change and whether climate change is even happening can lead to national and global complacency and an incentive to take no action in regards to environmental issues she said in an email PERIOD

Hopke highlighted that another important thing for media reporters to consider is how much an extreme weather event may have been intensified or made more frequent due to climate changes effects PERIOD

It is actually possible in many cases for climate scientists to model to what degree was a particular extreme weather event influenced by climate change she said PERIOD

Eshelman also echoed the importance of connecting the intensity of storms to climate change PERIOD

TV meteorologists have a tremendous role to play in connecting extreme weather to climate changelocal meteorologists really stepping out and trying to do segments that inform the readers about how the frequency of more intense more extreme weather events is a result of changing climate which is caused by human actions he said PERIOD

When it comes to the potential for catastrophe were on the clock with climate change PERIOD Our perception of this issue has been shaped by the voices we hear and those voices get selected for us PERIOD We need to break down this largely manufactured political disagreement  especially if were going to act before the clock runs out PERIOD
