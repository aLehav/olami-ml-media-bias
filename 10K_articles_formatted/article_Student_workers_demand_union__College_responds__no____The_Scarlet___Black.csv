There has been an ongoing dispute this semester between College administration and the Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers UGSDW over the expansion of the union to cover nearly all students employed on campus PERIOD Recently UGSDW has launched a postering and social media campaign to draw attention to the dispute over student dining workers status as employees. the campaign highlights Grinnell Assistant Vice President of Human Resources Mary Greiners use of the term student workers rather than employees. uGSDW claims that the term implies that students employed by the college should not be afforded the same rights as nonstudent workers such as the right to organize PERIOD

As an employee of a private corporation or business organization as employees of Grinnell College are we are given certain rights granted by the federal government the most important being under the National Labor Relations Act which gives us the ability to form a union if the employees wish said Alec Doss  president of UGSDW PERIOD And that applies to all employees PERIOD And while theres a whole bunch of labor law under the decision such as NLRA that goes into who exactly can form unions what Mary Greiner is saying about students who work in the mailroom or the library by saying they are not employees thats denying them the rights that are accorded to them under federal law. the SGA cabinet has even become involved in collecting information on the Colleges position according to UGSDW and as such intends to contact the Colleges legal counsel PERIOD

I know that Student Government is going to be having a call with the Colleges lawyer on this very matter said Quinn Erlocani  UGSDW vice president and SGA senator PERIOD

Although The SB was unable to obtain an interview with Greiner President Raynard Kington released a Campus Memo addressing the issue on Wednesday April  PERIOD

While we recognize the income that students earn may play an important part in financing their education students working at the College are not here primarily to earn a living Kington wrote in the memo PERIOD The College values the work performed by students however our view of these jobs is based upon the central and fundamentally educational relationship between students and Grinnell College PERIOD Therefore it is the Colleges position that workstudy participants should not be considered employees for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act and we oppose the intrusion of collective bargaining into the educational relationship. kington also argued with regards to union expansion that the various student positions do not share a Community of Interest and that a single union could therefore not be expanded to include all of them PERIOD And If dozens of unions were formed to cover each of the groups of student positions that are related it would be unduly burdensome and expensive to administer such a system Kington wrote this could have an adverse impact on our students who receive financial aid through the workstudy program. so what exactly is a work study position According to Brad Lindberg assistant vice president of enrollment and director of financial aid work study is really to help students to earn money to pay for their educational expenses. grinnell does have a different system from many other colleges and universities because students that are not on workstudy can obtain many of the same positions as students who are PERIOD

We are able to have positions to accommodate our students on campus those students who arent on need based aid are able to obtain jobs Lindberg said PERIOD In other words students participating in work study programs work alongside students who are not PERIOD

Perhaps in part for this reason the UGSDW does not believe it is relevant whether a student employed on campus is part of workstudy or not PERIOD

While our employment may be through workstudy program we are still employees Doss said PERIOD

In response to Kingtons statement Doss drew upon the example of graduate student instructors at Columbia University who in  were ruled to be employees for the purposes of the NLRA by the National Labor Relations Board PERIOD

The fact that this case is from a graduate school does not preclude it from applying at Grinnell Doss wrote PERIOD Workers across campus perform and are compensated for work in many departments which makes them employees. looking forward the UGSDW has released a formal response indicating that they will continue to advocate for an expansion of the Union PERIOD

Lets face it the workstudy work force is not the same as the nonstudent work force PERIOD Many of the positions are created and filled mostly as a way to provide financial aid in return for work but are not managed by the same financial standards PERIOD In other words a lot of student positions wouldnt even exist or would be more rigorous or timeinflexible if they were real world jobs PERIOD When I was student dining hall worker I was well aware that I was not working under the same set of expectations as those for my nonstudent coworkers PERIOD

Workstudy is not only a term it is a federally funded program as well PERIOD  It is in the colleges interest to have workstudy because they get funds to partially support the student wages PERIOD  Of course the students benefit but so does the college  this outside of the fact that the college can pay a lower wage per hour than if it had to get the work done by hiring fulltime  hour per week employees PERIOD  In addition workstudy typically shows up in a financial aid package as a single number i.e PERIOD  which is part of calculating the overall aid package PERIOD  However that number is not a guaranteed figure PERIOD  Quite often due to limitations in available hours limitations in student schedule etc. a student might end the year making less than that  figure PERIOD  Keep in mind as well that while most students are exempt from federal tax withholding in their wages it is not a guarantee PERIOD  So in order to balance out in an aid package the award figure needs to be achieved in netearnings not gross earnings PERIOD  You can publish this or not  but share it with the reporter and with the students wanting to organize PERIOD  It is yet another example of the college being a disingenuous negotiator PERIOD  The simple fact they were comfortable paying local high school students doing the same work alongside college student employees in the dining hall is indication their social justice position is in word only not in deed PERIOD","Student workers demand union, College responds ‘no’ – The Scarlet & Black",Grinnell College
