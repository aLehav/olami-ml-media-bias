Mainly clear PERIOD Low 37F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm







Miranda Horn left learned through a severe injury that prioritizing mental health as a bigtime athlete is as important as physical health PERIOD

Rowing is an incomprehensibly painful sport PERIOD From the shoreline it looks rhythmic and graceful but in the boat its agony PERIOD Trust me I would know PERIOD

Theres an anxious calm at the starting lineup of a race PERIOD Each boat points down the course at the finish line just over a mile away about seven minutes PERIOD When the referee drops the start flag you see two things happen rowers press their legs into the footboards with all their strength bringing the oar with them and deep swirling indents being carved into the water PERIOD Each rowers firm leg pressing into the footboards and pulling the oar sends the boat racing down the course PERIOD

In most sports athletes conserve their energy for the final sprint at the end of the race PERIOD In rowing the race starts and ends with a sprint PERIOD This means rowers are already exhausted by a minute in PERIOD

Each push of the legs increases the burn of lactic acid PERIOD It feels like lava is pouring into your quad muscles PERIOD Once the sprint is over the boat drops in stroke rate but rowers never lay off the power PERIOD Instead the boat finds a new rhythm PERIOD

Its at the start of the second sprint near the end of the race where a rower finds the depths of their strength and endurance PERIOD Rowers always find another gear more power to give for their teammates in the boat pushing just as hard as they are PERIOD



Pain in athletics

Every athlete faces pain during their sport PERIOD Usually they feel the pain of pushing their bodies to exhaustion to get stronger PERIOD With rowing though the pain of pushing your body is grueling and constant surpassing any sport Ive ever played including basketball volleyball soccer lacrosse and track and field PERIOD This is what made it hard for me to recognize that I was pushing my body into an injury PERIOD

During a practice at the end of first semester my freshman year is likely when I herniated my disk PERIOD I remember pulling at the end of a stroke on the rowing machine and feeling a sharp tweak in my back PERIOD The tweak immediately sent shooting shocks of agony down my nerves towards my feet PERIOD

Miranda Horn front began rowing for KU during her freshman year PERIOD

I knew I had really damaged my back when tiny body movements like tilting my head to the side became excruciating PERIOD Little movements would start up the electric waves down my leg each time PERIOD

I saw a doctor a few times over winter break to get my back in a stable place so I could at least sit PERIOD To me maintaining my progress in rowing was more important than resting my back PERIOD

I didnt have much time to recover either PERIOD As divisionone athletics often requires my winter break was shortened for training PERIOD At the beginning of January I traveled back to Lawrence from my hometown St PERIOD Louis PERIOD From there the rowing team traveled to Tampa for winter training PERIOD Two weeks of twoaday practices in the Florida heat PERIOD

Putting ones body through two threehour practices a day for two weeks while also being injured is a recipe for disaster PERIOD

Two other aspects of rowing make injury difficult to manage PERIOD First logistically youre in a boat so it isnt convenient to tap out of a practice miles away from a dock PERIOD An eightperson boat needs eight people to row it PERIOD There has to be someone to replace you or the entire boat has to head in and row on the machines on land PERIOD

Second norms of rowing culture frown upon standing up from a workout PERIOD Rowing workouts are grueling and standing up is often equated to mental weakness or fear of the imminent pain that builds with each stroke PERIOD When I was injured I didnt want my teammates to think I was getting up because I wasnt strong enough PERIOD So I would complete the workouts even if my body told me to stop PERIOD

I continued to row through my injury for the remainder of my freshman year through summer training and throughout my sophomore year PERIOD The week of spring break during my sophomore year which for rowers is another weeklong training camp I broke down PERIOD I was in an insurmountable amount of physical pain from my back and my mental health was suffering because of it PERIOD

But the COVID19 pandemic saved me PERIOD After our final practice of spring break training we all walked into the locker room and read the most recent text on our phones PERIOD The Big  Conference canceled all sports due to rampant COVID19 infection rates PERIOD That was the abrupt end of my second year of rowing PERIOD

With the many months at home quarantining I had countless hours to talk with my parents and therapist about my mental and physical health PERIOD At first I felt I had to continue rowing PERIOD I was pushing through hefty pain but sports had been my entire life PERIOD After  years of basketball and three years of rowing I had to call for it all to stop PERIOD

It took these countless conversations for me to decide that I must stop rowing PERIOD My injury was not healing PERIOD The impact of the hardships I faced was compromising my relationships school and much more PERIOD

So I decided to stop rowing PERIOD

Now two years later I know I made the right decision PERIOD



Mental toughness and athletics

Athletes are taught from a young age about the importance of mental toughness PERIOD Ive heard the phrase there is no I in team more times than I can remember PERIOD So over time we internalize that the success of the team surpasses the wellbeing of ourselves PERIOD

I now know that mental toughness is not shown by practicing  hours a week on a serious back injury PERIOD Instead I was mentally tough when I advocated for my physical and mental health PERIOD I was mentally tough when I had to decide to end my athletic career PERIOD I had the difficult conversation with my coaches team doctors and mental health professionals so that I could medically disqualify from rowing and still maintain my athletic scholarship PERIOD

I am not saying athletes shouldnt push through the aches and pains of sports PERIOD I had my fair share of playing basketball games on freshly rolled ankles or pulled muscles PERIOD I know how tiring it is to play three basketball games backtoback PERIOD

But with this injury I was steamrolling through warning signs for years  flashing red lights from my body telling me it had given me  and needed me to stop and rest PERIOD

Mental toughness can be shown in many more ways than the glory of bigtime athletics PERIOD This is something Ive reminded myself often as I moved on from rowing PERIOD Sometimes there is a better path and sometimes pushing through isnt going to get you there PERIOD
