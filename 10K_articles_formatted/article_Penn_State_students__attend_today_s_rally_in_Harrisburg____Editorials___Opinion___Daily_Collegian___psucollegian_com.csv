531,1970-01-01,"today students from Penn State Temple University Lincoln University and the University of Pittsburgh will host the second Rally for Higher Education on the steps of the state Capitol building in Harrisburg PERIOD

Last year about  students from Penn State attended thePennsylvania Association of Staterelated Schools rally while  students from Pittsburgh  students from Temple and  students from Lincoln attended PERIOD

The numbers from Penn State are simply embarrassing PERIOD

If you are upset about increased tuition bills you should be at the rally making your voice heard PERIOD

At recent town hall meetings many more than  students attended to show their concern in the affairs of the school  this rally should be no different PERIOD

The University Park Undergraduate Association has organized free bus to take students to Harrisburg and it is a universityexcused absence from classes PERIOD Theyve even included a free lunch for students PERIOD

So why are only  students  including  UPUA representatives  signed up on the PASS Rally Google Document to attend the rally as of  p.m PERIOD Monday

To get more students to attend student leaders could have done more to publicize this event PERIOD

Tweeting about the event to the UPUA twitter accounts  followers isnt the way to advertise PERIOD

A booth in the HUBRobeson Center or posters would have gotten the word out much more effectively PERIOD

UPUA you have a very important role on this campus that comes with great power  please use that power to inform students about the events you are organizing PERIOD

This should have been recognized as something important to the students of Penn State and should have been publicized so students could have planned on attending the rally weeks ago PERIOD

This rally has been planned for weeks and there is no excuse for not giving students information well in advance PERIOD

The bus leaves at  this morning PERIOD

We can only hope a line of students will be waiting to board the bus to Harrisburg today PERIOD
