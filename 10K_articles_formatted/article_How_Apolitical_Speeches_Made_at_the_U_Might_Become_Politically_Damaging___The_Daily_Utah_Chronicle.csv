395,2018-12-03,"former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden speaks at Kingsbury Hall on the University of Utah Campus on Dec PERIOD   PERIOD Photo by Justin Prather  The Daily Utah Chronicle

By Maddy La Turner and Miacel Spotted ElkDecember  

While The Daily Utah Chronicle was investigating response times to public records requests made to the University of Utah earlier this year reporters uncovered two names of particular interest among the list of people requesting information Allan Blutstein and Darin Gibbons PERIOD The two men work in opposition research trying to find information that could damage the careers of political candidates PERIOD



Blutstein is a lawyer at America Rising a political action committee that produces opposition research on Democratic candidates said Juliet Carlisle a political science professor at the U in an email interview PERIOD Opposition research is a probe into a political figures background for anything that could damage their reputation PERIOD Their purpose is to collect any information that will tarnish the image of a particular Democratic candidate in the minds of potential voters. according to his website FOIA Advisor Blutstein also informs clients on the Freedom of Information Act a law similar to GRAMA which allows people to make requests on unreleased information from the U.S PERIOD government PERIOD Blutstein appeared in The New York Times in  after making FOIA requests from outspoken Environmental Protection Agency officials PERIOD He called his requests a fishing expedition for anything that could damage their careers PERIOD

Blutstein did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the requests he made to the U PERIOD

Darin Gibbons is a lawyer based in Washington D.C PERIOD who is currently the Director of Investigations at the Republican National Committee according to his professional website PERIOD Federal Election Commission databases say his last publicly available payroll disbursement for work done for the RNC was on Feb PERIOD  of this year PERIOD Formerly the Vice President of Legal Affairs at America Rising Gibbons led a team during  to conduct opposition research regarding former Obamaappointed Supreme Court candidate Merrick Garland PERIOD

Gibbons also did not respond to multiple requests for comment PERIOD

Blutstein requested information from the University of Utah relating to Joe Bidens and Mark Kellys speaking appearances at the U PERIOD Gibbons also requested information about Bidens speech PERIOD Biden and Kelly are both currently candidates for Republicanheld political seats  Biden is running for president and Kelly is running for Senate in Arizona PERIOD



Kelly is a retired astronaut and former Navy captain who was part of NASAs twin study with his brother Scott PERIOD Scott spent an unprecedented  consecutive days in space so scientists could compare his health to Marks and try to understand the health impacts of long stays in space PERIOD

Mark spoke at Kingsbury Hall in  a month before Scott was scheduled to land on earth PERIOD The two of them  Mark in person and Scott via prerecorded video from the International Space Station  discussed their time in space and in the U.S PERIOD space program PERIOD

On Feb PERIOD   Kelly announced a bid for Senate and less than a month later Blutstein requested information about how much he was paid to speak at the U PERIOD

This information could have been obtained without a request to the U PERIOD Senate candidates are required to file a Senate Public Financial Disclosure Report for each calendar year they continue to be a candidate whether or not they are elected according to the U.S PERIOD Senate Select Committee on Ethics PERIOD This requires candidates to provide intensely detailed information about categories such as stocks financial partnerships income property monetary gifts and employment PERIOD This form would require Kelly to give all information about how much he was paid for his speaking appearances PERIOD The Secretary of the Senates Office of Public Records makes these forms available for the public without a government records request PERIOD

After Kelly decided to run for office he stopped accepting new offers for speaking appearances PERIOD The Arizona Republic reported that his booked engagements ended Oct PERIOD  according to his campaign  more than a year before the  general election. biden spoke at the U in December  almost two years after his time in office ended PERIOD MUSE whose goal is to provide educational experiences that help you develop your unique potential for intellectual and imaginative work put on the event PERIOD As part of MUSEs  theme of purpose Biden spoke about his book Promise Me Dad which discusses his sons battle with brain cancer PERIOD

Bidens speaking appearance was announced on Dec PERIOD  PERIOD Less than  hours later Blutstein had already requested information about it  nine days before the actual speech and months before Biden announced his bid for the presidency PERIOD However Blutstein didnt request a copy of Bidens contract with the U as he did with Kelly PERIOD Instead he requested the communications between several MUSE employees who helped organize the event PERIOD

Months later on Feb PERIOD   Gibbons filed a public records request with the U for information regarding the planning and communication of Bidens appearance at the university PERIOD When the university responded they informed him he would need to pay  for the U to process the request PERIOD Gibbons never paid the fee and eventually the request was closed without him receiving the documents PERIOD

However Arlette Saenz a CNN reporter who covers Biden had earlier made a similar request to the Us public records office PERIOD She sought emails and documents relating to negotiations for the event contracts scheduling and logistics that pertained to Joe Bidens speech PERIOD Though Saenz never reported on the event records were successfully obtained which document the communication between the U  specifically between the staff members of the MUSE Project and the Creative Artist Agency who represents Biden PERIOD

The  academic year was the first year we received any requests like this said Libby Henriksen one of the MUSE employees whose emails were requested via an email interview PERIOD We dont often receive requests of a political nature PERIOD We believe this particular request came when it did because at the time we hosted Vice President Joe Biden as our MUSE keynote guest there was a good deal of speculation surrounding his thenpotential run for the presidency. mark Matheson the other MUSE employee whose emails were requested reaffirmed Henriksens comments PERIOD



Opposition research is a wellknown tactic to provide information that can serve politically beneficial for both members of Democratic and Republican parties PERIOD As a wide array of Democratic candidates compete for the upcoming primaries to eventually face against President Donald Trump in the  election opposition research is an especially valuable tool PERIOD

It can play a big role in this upcoming democratic nomination contest because there is no clear frontrunner said James Curry a U political science professor who focuses on American politics PERIOD You might use it to attack your opponents character which is very popular in our form of elections because our form of elections are very personalized. opposition research has been used throughout American history according to Curry PERIOD Things like Thomas Jefferson having a child with a slave was something that was dug up during his presidency as a form of opposition research from Federalists who are trying to undercut a popular president Curry said PERIOD

More recent instances of information revealing conduct by candidates that was deemed unseemly by the press or public includes information about former senator Jack Hart and current president Donald Trump PERIOD

During the  presidential election the formerDemocratic candidate was the frontrunner until it was discovered Hart had been involved in an extramarital affair PERIOD He subsequently ended his campaign PERIOD

During the  presidential campaigns a video surfaced uncovering Trump describing sexual interactions with women on his way to film an episode of Access Hollywood PERIOD Viewers and politicians like former House Speaker Paul Ryan responded negatively PERIOD

In the past organizations like ABC News have published lists of the highest speaking fees from political figures PERIOD Donald Trump tops the list at . million per speech PERIOD Hillary Clinton charges  on average PERIOD Combined with the speaking fees former president and husband Bill Clinton charges the Clintons made  million in speaking fees alone as of  PERIOD

People working in politics doing opposition research like Blutstein and Gibbons might request this kind of information to impugn the character of a particular candidate so that voters might consider something possibly unsavory as a reason to not vote for someone who they might otherwise possibly support Carlisle said PERIOD

As a strategist for the RNC Gibbons appears to have been trying to find information that could compromise the image of multiple candidates documents from Quinsigamond Community College in Massachusetts show Gibbons also sought records from that institution planning Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warrens commencement speech on May  last year PERIOD

According to the documents requested made by Blutstein Kelly was paid  for his speaking appearance at the U PERIOD He makes an average of  per speech PERIOD

The documents Gibbons sought show that the U agreed to pay Biden  for his speech  which was described as a reduced rate for colleges and universities  but he declined to be paid after learning the funds would come from the state or from U students tuition PERIOD The New York Times described this move as maintaining viability as a potential  presidential contender. its hard to say whether voters care about speakers fees per se Carlisle said but speakers fees can demonstrate which interest groups to which a candidate might be perceived as beholden politically speaking and that could repel certain voters or be perceived by some to have a conflict of interest. emailprotected
