Assistant Professor of Chemistry at USI Brian Bohrer was unsure about the safety of lake water at the Bluegrass Fish and Wildlife Area PERIOD

According to IN.gov The Amaz Coal company began mining operations in October  and ceased operations in . the strip mine eventually filled with water and an effort was made to bring vegetation back to the area PERIOD

Now its like this really scenic finger lakes area Bohrer said PERIOD

He said the area is frequented by families that take pictures with sunflowers or hunt waterfowl PERIOD

Though the area was remediated questions remained about the safety of the lakes that exist in the former coal mine PERIOD

The primary source of pollution contamination or cause of physiological or environmental concern was probably the heavy metals contained in coal Bohrer said PERIOD

Coal is mainly a fuel source but does contain heavy metals in various concentrations he said PERIOD It is possible for coal to contain metals such as aluminum and zinc or in smaller quantities more dangerous metals like arsenic mercury and lead PERIOD

Although we were pretty confident that the coal mining industry would take most of the coal with them theres inevitably stuff that falls off the truck and then gets run over and pulverized into dust and gets blown away Bohrer said PERIOD

We were concerned that this residue would leech into the water he said PERIOD

That being said the hypothesis was that if this was previously a coal mine how safe is this Bohrer said PERIOD

We took measurements from the lakes and compared them to measurements taken in the surrounding geographical area he said PERIOD Samples were collected from Reflection Lake an apartment complex lake the Bohrer Family Farm which sits a mile away from BGFWA among other areas PERIOD

I gathered some of the baseline samples and gathered all of the bluegrass samples myself on a bike ride Bohrer said PERIOD

A total of four students helped with the study he said PERIOD Three are undergrads at USI and one is currently enrolled at IU PERIOD

Bohrer said we expected to find dissolved metals in any sample taken in the Evansville area but wanted to know how that compared to measurements taken from the finger lakes PERIOD

In addition to comparing the heavy metal content of the BGFWA to the immediate geographical area the team wanted to compare the data to EPA guidelines for aquatic life and drinking water he said PERIOD

We were looking at those as a pair of comparative tools to then use in interpreting our findings Bohrer said PERIOD

The results of the study were a mixed bag he said PERIOD

The first conclusion was that we found no evidence for metals being above any of these thresholds I just discussed Bohrer said PERIOD It seems to be a safe area PERIOD Thats the really quick conclusion and happy ending you know we were happy to find that. still there were some differences between the control data set and the data from the finger lakes PERIOD

When an area like this is remediated its that threshold they really focus to get below they arent focused on making it just like the region they are just looking to make it safe Bohrer said PERIOD

It is possible that this is the reason for discrepancies in some of the metal content found in the BGFWA compared to the surrounding area PERIOD

According to Dr PERIOD Bohrers paper Seventyfive percent or more of individual measurements from the BGFWA are greater in abundance for barium or strontium than the highest concentrations observed in the control dataset. the levels at which the metals are present is not threatening he said PERIOD

Neither is really a big concern Bohrer said PERIOD This is not something the EPA seems to be that concerned with PERIOD There is a drinking water standard for barium but not for strontium. the other significant difference in the data set was the measurable amount of copper in the BGWFA that was not present in the other samples he said PERIOD

Again none of those measurable levels were of concern in terms of being in terms of it being above some safety guideline for aquatic life Bohrer said PERIOD

Bohrer is not done in this vein of research PERIOD

Theres definitely room for more investigation on this and students are definitely more than welcome to knock on our door and get involved he said
