Oswald Jenewein visiting architecture assistant professor initially visited UTA in  as a graduate student from Austria participating in the architecture exchange program PERIOD

Three years later he moved to UTA for a teaching position PERIOD

Exchange programs are longer than typical facultyled trips Jenewein said PERIOD Its a semester of classes placed at another university PERIOD

Now as chairperson of the colleges study abroad committee and the Austria program coordinator he wants to help offer the same opportunities to UTA students PERIOD

Jenewein said no students were participating in the exchange program in  PERIOD This semester six students are currently abroad with more to follow PERIOD

Because of his previous experience studying abroad he decided to utilize his connection with the University of Innsbruck in Austria to help facilitate the program and open it to undergraduate students in addition to graduate students PERIOD

The program has increased in the last two years and has the highest participation numbers in at least  years which is how far the record goes back Jenewein said PERIOD

Jenewein said he wouldnt be surprised if it were the highest ever though PERIOD

Studying architecture and studying abroad go handinhand he said PERIOD

Architecture is a cultural practice he said PERIOD Its not only about the built environment in a specific place but really including the environment as a whole. the exchange programs with students currently abroad are made possible through collaborations with the University of Innsbruck and Lund University in Sweden PERIOD

Six students are currently abroad through the exchange program five in Austria and one in Sweden PERIOD

Four students from Innsbruck have been nominated to come to UTA next semester after a fiveyear period with none Jenewein said PERIOD

Architecture junior Nicholas Foxx decided to participate in the Innsbruck program to gain new experiences and learn about architecture in a new context PERIOD

In terms of being an architecture major and studying abroad I think its especially important just for me to be able to see all these places that I study he said during a video call from Innsbruck PERIOD

Housed in a valley and dubbed the capital of the Alps Foxx said he often enjoys the views of snowcapped mountains while eating a breakfast of freshly baked bread PERIOD

Ive definitely learned a lot about myself just in the short amount of time just you know being away from home and friends and sort of being somewhat isolated he said PERIOD

The Innsbruck classes are much less structured than classes hes taken in the U.S. focusing more on abstracts than concrete answers Foxx said PERIOD

Its a great opportunity to get outside of your comfort zone and experience a different part of the world and a you know different style and methodology of architecture he said PERIOD Its a complete you know lifestyle change. although he appreciates his education Foxx said the change in approach is refreshing and hed love to see a similar approach of organic and interpretive learning at UTA PERIOD

Foxx said hes not sure whether hes going to live internationally or stay in the U.S PERIOD after graduation but he could see himself back in Innsbruck PERIOD

Architecture graduate student Braison Boykin has completed four months out of six with Lund University PERIOD

The environment is very liberal and laid back he said during a video call PERIOD Breaks are taken very seriously with hourlong segments of time dedicated to recharging energy in the middle of a school day PERIOD

Classes are also more interpretive he said PERIOD There isnt just one right answer but a variety PERIOD

Boykin said hed miss the way cities were laid out in Europe when returning to the states PERIOD Theyre walkable and have public transit trains arts and culture he said PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD should emulate the public transportation model in Sweden he said PERIOD

This experience has been inspirational to him as a designer and he recommends it to any student who has a chance to travel PERIOD

Its really important for people to step out and kind of see what life is like from a different perspective he said PERIOD
