2632,2023-11-04,"i briskly walked to the University Art Gallery on campus around  p.m. hoping that I wasnt missing anything for the opening reception of Barbara T PERIOD Smiths solo exhibit The Radicalization of a 50s Housewife which started at  p.m PERIOD on Wednesday Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

I attended the exhibit with little knowledge about Smith and her work other than knowing that she was enrolled as a master of fine arts student at UC Irvine in  and is now a performance artist PERIOD With such an eyecatching title I immediately knew that this exhibit would be visually striking and thoughtprovoking it surely was but in the most unexpected and unique way PERIOD

The opening reception for Smiths solo exhibit was unlike others I have attended in the past PERIOD A title that contains the words radicalization and 50s housewife is already enough to make me assume that Ill find common images of feministthemed art PERIOD However this solo exhibit sets Smith apart in that she takes the aspects of feminist art to a highly personal and spiritual level PERIOD Additionally the exhibit shows how much Smith embodies the very essence of a performance artist and ultimately being a woman living in modern American society PERIOD

As soon as I reached the gallery the entrance door was wide open warmly welcoming all PERIOD Inside was surprisingly quiet and for a moment I believed that I was going to be the only visitor for the evening PERIOD Ive been inside the University Art Gallery for several other opening receptions which were usually full of noise and all kinds of visitors walking about and socializing PERIOD Interestingly the virtual stillness inside the gallery seemed to turn into a part of Smiths solo exhibit PERIOD The absence of a crowd which I would normally expect at an opening reception only emphasized the transcendental yet eerie quality of Smiths art PERIOD

Not far from the entrance of the gallery the first works I encountered were already poignant and conveyed intimacy and an eerie spirituality PERIOD To my left a few boldly colorful costume pieces designed by Smith were on hangers PERIOD Displayed on another wall nearby Woman on Ladder  Man Holds Gun  was a set of eight pairs of calligraphic pictures PERIOD Each pair had a female character in various poses and the male character was drawn as if he was well holding a gun PERIOD A few steps away an adjacent wall showed off over a dozen of Smiths fiberglass collages with fitting titles such as Oh Baby Broken Bones Keep Blushing Diptych What did you do in the war and Pray for us just to name a few PERIOD

As I became entranced by the fiberglass collages the rooms silence made it very easy to hear the slightly creepy audio recording of what sounded like sacred ritualistic music and the solemn voices of whom I believed belonged to Smith and of the individuals who took part in Smiths  performance piece Birthdaze which also happened to be a major  if not the main  component of the entire solo exhibit PERIOD

As my attention shifted to the eerie recordings filling up the quiet room I broke my gaze from the fiberglass collages and turned toward the rest of the objects on display behind me only to realize that everything else in this portion of the exhibit related to the Birthdaze performance piece PERIOD

Birthdaze was produced in  and then performed by Smith along with her male counterpart artist Victor Henderson on her fiftieth birthday PERIOD A threepart performance it relates to Smiths personal experiences of being pressured into and then feeling entrapped as being the ideal 50s housewife and then freeing  or radicalizing  herself from it all by separating from her husband and becoming a performance artist PERIOD

As mentioned in the exhibit brochure Smith describes Part  as a humorous metaphor of my and many womens early adulthood PERIOD Part   as an abstract representation of a major drama which shadows the lives of most men and women and Part  was a ritual which suggested a different way for men and women to relate to each other. smiths Birthdaze is a personally derived depiction of the relationship between men and women and it encompasses a threepart journey that continually interrogates the category of gender. all the props and costumes that were adjacent to the documented photographs pertaining to each part of Birthdaze were stylistically arranged right before me PERIOD The most alluring was a tall white translucent veil that hung gracefully from the ceiling and concealed the props used for the Tantric ritual in the performances final scene PERIOD Although I found it pretty amazing that just about everything from the performance surrounded me Im sure it doesnt compare to witnessing the live original performance PERIOD

By then I felt like Birthdaze told me everything I needed to know about Smiths artwork PERIOD But I saw that there was more to see and learn about toward the back of the gallery PERIOD

Encased in two separate tables Smiths personal documents that include postcards letters and wedding photos are spread out for all to see PERIOD Surrounding the two tables are earlier sculptures collages and recorded interviews from the mid1960s to early1970s reiterate and bring more depth into Smiths artistic themes of spirituality and sexuality PERIOD Colorful sketches with titles like Allen and Barbara Smith and Rear View Mirror that were made before her divorce in  could possibly indicate an agitated Smith wanting out from the cookiecutter expectations of being a housewife PERIOD

I left the exhibit with a sense of awe and admiration having learned about Smith and the consistently and incredibly strong presence of her art through its personally unique portrayal PERIOD The Radicalization of a 50s Housewife is engaging visually intellectually and emotionally PERIOD Anyone can witness the creations of the largely unknown talented artist Barbara T PERIOD Smith until Dec PERIOD   PERIOD
