One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

Calling my younger brother is a common occurrence at least three times a week PERIOD We typically start our conversations talking about 80s music with him pointing out Pink Floyd and ACDC posters on my dorm wall and asking if Id heard one of their deep cuts PERIOD During our last conversation I called while he was eating lunch prepared to ask him about his music taste PERIOD

Whats up he answered tiredly PERIOD

Shouting voices of a high school cafeteria distracted from his voice PERIOD I asked him to go somewhere quiet PERIOD He agreed and I waited a minute as the background noise didnt quell nor did I hear the telltale sign of footsteps PERIOD

You didnt move I accused PERIOD

Well I like the spot Im in. i glared at my phone but didnt fight him on it PERIOD

This is just a conversation PERIOD Im your sister not an interviewer. whatever you say he bit back PERIOD

To preface Hayden is  years old spends an hour a day grooming his hair and effortlessly charms everyone he meets PERIOD We both claim we got the good genes even though we look nothing alike PERIOD

My mom loved to gloat over her and my uncle being the best of friends even in their adult years  that seemed impossible PERIOD My brother and I as best friends Never in a million years PERIOD I simply lived by the rule of no one messes with my brother but me PERIOD Truthfully I think that Im somewhere between an adequate and mediocre sister to him PERIOD

As children I would grudgingly help with his homework punch a bully or two who had hurt him and always offer to play Star Wars with him even if I would treat him like a piata with my toy lightsaber PERIOD We werent exactly best friends but a chaotic duo capable of terrifying babysitters PERIOD It happened to be that as children nothing was more fun than the outrageously dangerous ideas wed come up with PERIOD In my defense wed typically walk out with an equal number of bruises PERIOD

When I hit the preteens Hayden and I went our separate ways PERIOD Or more accurately I went my own way and prevented him from following PERIOD There was no malicious intent to blindside my younger brother PERIOD I simply thought it was time to go through my emo phase in which I exclusively listened to Fall Out Boy and yelled at anyone who tried to get me to leave my room PERIOD Unfortunately that included him PERIOD

Eventually Hayden got old enough to learn that asking me nicely to play with him wouldnt work and he had to get my attention with different tactics PERIOD He would mistakenly place alarm clocks under my bed that went off at  a.m. cover my room with toilet paper and insist on only blasting music when it was time for homework PERIOD One time he taught our dog the command attack Logan a command that sent our dog running to me barking ferociously placing his front paws on my leg before smiling up at my brother for his guaranteed treat PERIOD Haydens creative mind thought of every Home Aloneesque trap to make me miserable PERIOD I naturally started to find his existence infuriating PERIOD

My parents excused his actions as attentionseeking PERIOD My dad who was the youngest brother growing up would sometimes laugh at Haydens more innocent antics PERIOD To everyone else eating the last of my candy stash was harmless PERIOD Even though I understood Hayden only wanted to spend time with me I stubbornly decided that Id only do so when he decided not to be a pain PERIOD That left us at an impasse for five years PERIOD

Of course I felt guilty at points PERIOD I was too proud to give into his wishes which made me hypocritical when asking for the maturity of a 10yearold boy PERIOD And in retrospect there was also a degree of jealousy PERIOD He was born a future prom king and captain of every club and sports team thought of PERIOD I had been a gawky nerd with braces glasses and bangs that never suited me PERIOD Eventually high school life took over my limited free time and Hayden found his own friends to focus on PERIOD

When quarantine started we were suddenly thrust back together in the same small New York City apartment PERIOD He staked his claim over the TV but I won the speakers  meaning Hayden was forced to listen to everything I did PERIOD I take enough pride in my music taste to call it eclectic but Ive always favored rock music PERIOD I range from Elton John ballads to Led Zeppelin hard rock and even British New Wave PERIOD Eventually came the questions PERIOD

Who sings this song Hed shout while Paint it Black generated noise complaints from the neighbors PERIOD

The Rolling Stones Id dryly respond before stealing his snacks from the kitchen PERIOD A few weeks went by with little fanfare over Mick Jaggers voice filling up the living room PERIOD

One day in September I dared to venture into his room PERIOD I had almost been too distracted by the teenage boy smell to notice the chorus of Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones playing out of his speakers PERIOD

Good song I commented PERIOD

Thanks he responded noticeably perplexed PERIOD There had been a disbelieving note to his voice PERIOD Had I actually complimented him without sarcasm or was it a hidden insult We made brief eye contact before a silent agreement to never speak of it again PERIOD

Over the course of the next year more 80s rock would sound from his room PERIOD I recognized it as the music Id constantly play PERIOD

During our recent phone call Id brought up his repetition of my music PERIOD So do you admire me and my fantastic taste or something I asked teasingly PERIOD

No he scoffed before pausing to think PERIOD I listened to rap because my friends did PERIOD But COVID meant I didnt spend time with them and I realized I liked your music better PERIOD But when you think about it its Dads music not yours. i hummed in agreement PERIOD My music taste had originated from my dad recommending me music from his childhood PERIOD Id reject any suggestion to his face yet proceed to add it to my library later PERIOD

As I left for my freshman year at the University of Michigan Hayden and I jokingly excluded our dad as we talked about our new shared music taste PERIOD I bought my brother a vinyl record of David Bowies greatest hits and we started arguing over the Beatles PERIOD He claimed he knew more of their songs A ridiculous unprovable claim PERIOD

Ive seen Across the Universe more times than you he announced over our recent phone call referring to the  movie featuring exclusively Beatles songs PERIOD

No you havent its literally my favorite movie musical

Then Ive seen Yesterday more times than you he countered bringing up yet another Beatlesbased movie PERIOD

That doesnt matter PERIOD It wasnt even that good. he agreed PERIOD

Great plot but couldve been executed better. hayden had clearly overanalyzed the movie too PERIOD We both went silent over the phone until a question came to my mind PERIOD

So thats why we get along now Music I asked with a subtle endearment in my voice PERIOD YetI knew the answer before he said it PERIOD

Nah he responds PERIOD A high schooler cheered across the call and I had to wait another minute before Hayden replied PERIOD We matured ya know

I did know PERIOD The pandemic had changed our family dynamic PERIOD My brother and I are fortunate enough to have supportive parents but we were forced to grow up faster in the past two years PERIOD Our parents worked longer and harder so our responsibilities grew PERIOD We had been tasked with taking care of our sickly grandparents and parent guidance diminished PERIOD As the pandemic progressed we started to alternate between our apartment and grandparents Connecticut house PERIOD For half a year wed only catch a glimpse of each other during the transitioning car rides PERIOD I only knew of his evolving music taste from our shared Apple Music account PERIOD

I didnt need you for entertainment then or anything anymore PERIOD We started to do everything alone. hayden added as an afterthought PERIOD I ignored the ache in my chest that came with his words PERIOD Maybe if I hadnt been so dismissive he wouldve needed me PERIOD He didnt try to bother me for attention anymore and while it was once unwanted now the constant irritation was gone leaving only a frostiness in its wake PERIOD We couldve shared the burdens of the past year PERIOD But I was an adult and he was fifteen which seemed close enough PERIOD I accepted his newfound independence and pressed on PERIOD

So why do you think we talk now I questioned PERIOD

Youre nicer now PERIOD You treat me like a normal human being an equal not a child he explained PERIOD Whenever you were with your friends youd act all superior and want me to leave PERIOD This weekend you were cool though. of course I had been cool that past weekend PERIOD It was parents weekend and the first time I had seen him since the summer PERIOD After three days in Ann Arbor he was already planning out his supplemental essays for admission PERIOD It had helped that he made fast friends with my roommate going so far as to refer to her as the sister I always wanted. i even walked into the sight of him giving her 80s music recommendations like the Eagles and U2 PERIOD The three of us shared Pizza House feta bread while listening to ZZ Top PERIOD

And not much to my surprise Hayden got along with my friends PERIOD It made sense  we are similar PERIOD We have identical senses of humor think comparing the Beatles and the Rolling Stones is like comparing apples to oranges have a love of leather jackets and grew up watching the same Cartoon Network shows PERIOD Our high school extracurriculars are the same so were many of our high school friends PERIOD Our frequent conversations no longer stemmed from two siblings being shoved together by circumstance but simply a desire to share PERIOD

We talk about everything now music teachers we shared drama our parents PERIOD A few days ago after complaining to my roommate about the humiliation of asking a fifteenyearold for advice I reached out to my brother with a question about relationships PERIOD My roommate laughed and affirmed that he might be younger but knew me well enough to offer guidance PERIOD

I wanted to tell my new boyfriend about my feelings for him PERIOD Hayden instructed me to have a candlelit dinner wear a nice dress buy my boyfriend a box of cookies singlehandedly eat the box of cookies before gifting them for mental preparation and write a love letter instead PERIOD He then informed me that In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel and Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley were the two most romantic songs in existence PERIOD After we agreed over the latter 80s song we started to talk about our plans for the end of the school year PERIOD

Do you think well get along during the summer I asked Hayden over our recent call PERIOD

We wont fight quite as much PERIOD We might fight more in June since Ill have a month to get sick of you PERIOD And well both want to hang out more PERIOD Well want to hang out more PERIOD Like a friend

There was a hopeful note in his words one that only a sibling could hear PERIOD

So youd describe us as friends
