The Dundee Theater is a historic place having been in operation for longer than the vast majority of its patrons have been alive yet it has always been most famous for its Midnight Moviesa tradition that spanned many years given life by feverish community support PERIOD From  to  the theater showed fanfavorite films on a weekly basis from The Rocky Horror Picture Show to Princess Bride. the series enduring popularity could only do so much though and when a brief hiatus for muchneeded renovations to the theater transformed into an indefinite closing hope seemed lost for the tradition PERIOD However after years with no progress the theater was purchased and drastically renovated by Film Streams a local nonprofit dedicated to film PERIOD As the theater was resuscitated so too did the demand for Midnight Movies spring back to life PERIOD

There had been both brief and extended runs of Midnight Movies before but it wasnt until  that the tradition really kicked off PERIOD The theaters youthful staff had heavy input into the types of films that would play which lead to all sorts of classics gracing the screenThe Rocky Horror Picture Show became perhaps the most frequent and beloved midnight showing but many more films had audiences returning for more over the years like Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Pulp Fiction. as soon as it was announced that Film Streams would be taking over the Dundee Theater the resurrection of Midnight Movies quickly became the most prominent line of questioning directed towards the nonprofit by devoted fans and patrons PERIOD

One of the first things that we talked about internally was how the theater for almost two decades before it closed in  was synonymous with midnight movies in Omaha says Patrick Kinney Director of Marketing at Film Streams PERIOD Its something that we as a staff really loved to bring back. dundees Midnight Movies of antiquity had developed their own atmospherecostumes werent an infrequent sight the golden rule of no talking during the movie fell by the wayside and inside jokes were met with enthusiasm PERIOD Between all that the frequent shenanigans that took place and the building itself there was an inescapable informality to the whole thing PERIOD

Film Streams revival certainly kept many of the key elements but some changes were unavoidable PERIOD

We knew that we were never going to be able to catch that lightning in a bottle againthe Midnight Movies under its previous iteration had such a unique vibe atmosphere and following says Kinney PERIOD Obviously knowing that we could never replicate exactly what it was before it was good to see that it was still able to work in the space that we made it and really become its own thing. the differences between the classic and the new go beyond simply what was lostmuch of the programming has expanded beyond the nostalgia for previous decades and genre films that characterized Midnight Movies while also inherently including films that are outside of Film Streams usual art house sensibilities PERIOD This combination has created a very unique crowd of attendees PERIOD

It does attract people that are nostalgic for midnight movies but theres a new crowd that comes as well Kinney says PERIOD Even if theyre the same people who do come on a Sunday afternoon the mood is just different PERIOD Its its own unique kind of crowd theres really nothing else like it. as the entire planet shut down due to a certain pandemic Midnight Movies were once again put on hold PERIOD Film Streams has gradually been phasing things back in but Midnight Movies have yet to make their dramatic returna return that Kinney assures is still on its way PERIOD

While there may not be a full series in  we hope that there can be some pop up midnights still to come by the end of the year Kinney says PERIOD Theyre something that we love theyre such a part of the Dundee and we dont want to lose that at all PERIOD Its a priority to make sure that they can come back in a safe and sustainable way. a post shared by The Gateway thegatewayuno",The rebirth of Midnight Movies at the Dundee Theater - Gateway,"University of Nebraska, Omaha"
