Partly cloudy skies PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



OK college football fans PERIOD Roll up your sleeves sharpen your pencils and get out your pocket calculators PERIOD

Its time to handicap a national championship race that Virginia Tech managed to seriously complicate with its surprisingly easy  rout of Miami on Saturday night in Blacksburg Va PERIOD

If you are Miami fans it also wouldnt hurt to break out a rosary or some other cosmic aid because youre going to need somebody to intervene on your behalf PERIOD

And you Florida State and Southern California fans a strong antiperspirant will serve you well in the next month PERIOD If your teams win out youll be sweating this process out to the last decimal point when the final BCS poll appears in early December PERIOD

Heres the deal PERIOD The national title hunt is now a seventeam proposition PERIOD

Thats undefeated Oklahoma and the six oneloss teams that will line up behind them when the newest BCS poll comes out today PERIOD

According to expert BCS forecaster Jerry Palm Southern Cal will skip up two spots today as the new No PERIOD  with Florida State Miami Ohio State Virginia Tech and LSU following in that order PERIOD

Barring a wacky month of upsets nobody else has a chance to make it to the Nos PERIOD  Nokia Sugar Bowl match up in New Orleans on Jan PERIOD  including undefeated TCU which Palm forecasts as No PERIOD  in the newest BCS poll PERIOD

Southern Cals projected move to No PERIOD  is notable PERIOD With a  whipping Saturday of former Top  contender Washington State the Trojans will leapfrog Florida State which routed a lessimpressive Notre Dame  PERIOD The Trojans were No PERIOD  in both The Associated Press and USA TodayESPN polls released Sunday with FSU No PERIOD  PERIOD

Southern Cal and FSU clearly hold the inside track to a national title showdown with Oklahoma if all three of those teams win out PERIOD

 said Palm PERIOD 

Or FSU needs AP and USA TodayESPN voters to be so unimpressed by Southern Cal wins down the stretch that they move the Seminoles ahead of the Trojans PERIOD

 FSU coach Bobby Bowden told reporters Sunday PERIOD 



The Hurricanes projected to rank No PERIOD  in the new BCS poll likely need Southern Cal and FSU to lose to get to the Sugar Bowl PERIOD Still if Miami can get to No PERIOD  in the major polls its possible its strength of schedule and qualitywin bonus could propel the Hurricanes to No PERIOD  in the BCS poll PERIOD Miami on Sunday dropped to No PERIOD  in the AP poll and No PERIOD  in the USA TodayESPN poll PERIOD

 said Miami coach Larry Coker PERIOD 

Palm says Virginia Techs strength of schedule is so weak the Hokies might be the only oneloss team that could be passed by a twoloss team in the BCS poll down the stretch PERIOD Ohio State has strength of schedule going for it but like LSU and Virginia Tech the Buckeyes will probably need to get to No PERIOD  in the major polls to have a shot at playing in the Sugar Bowl PERIOD
