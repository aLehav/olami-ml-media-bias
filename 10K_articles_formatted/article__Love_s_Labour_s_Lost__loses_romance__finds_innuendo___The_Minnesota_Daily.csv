Loves Labours Lost WHERE Rarig Centers Whiting Proscenium Theater  twenty-first Ave PERIOD S. Mpls PERIOD WHEN Feb PERIOD   March  TICKETS    Director Kenneth Noel Mitchell knows how to put things in perspective PERIOD Often in life we are careless and frivolous until something like the earthquake in Haiti happens said Mitchell drawing a parallel between current events and the sobering second act of Shakespeares Loves Labours Lost. the Shakespearian work which you might recognize as a precursor to the  Christmas movie Love Actually revolves around a king and his three merry men that have taken an oath to devote all their time to studies of higher knowledge PERIOD In this vein they swear off women and food PERIOD Apparently food is no issue but the pleasures of the flesh prove insatiable when the beautiful French princess and her three ladiesinwaiting show up to settle an outstanding financial deal PERIOD Mitchell adapted Loves Labours Lost to be set in the roaring 20s PERIOD To Mitchell the time between WWI and WWII created an Edenlike lull in the litigious American society PERIOD Without the daily worries of food rationing and air raids all characters could focus on their constant and continuous failings in loves sorcery PERIOD The styling of the show knows no bounds much like its defined Charlestondancing  martinilittered era PERIOD Sequins galore flapper hats and slimfitting suits were expertly chosen for the performance but it was difficult to see the adaptations stretch beyond wardrobe choice PERIOD After all some of the flappers spoke in British accents when they were theoretically from France PERIOD The set is presumably a garden terrace along the lines of Gatsbys i dealized piazza but instead it felt like a forest from A Midsummer Nights Dream  with draped vines and glittering Christmas lights framing the stage PERIOD The shows obvious standouts were Jaquenetta  the slinking wench who seduces the court clown and the fantastical Spanish Don Adriano de Armado and Boyeta a furclad Pucklike woman who goes undercover VictorVictoria style for the French princess PERIOD The adaptation and delivery of every line is flawless and adds a comical structure to the sometimes frenetic performance PERIOD The most effective portion of the show was the intensity of the execution and the adaptation of harmless Shakespearian verses into salacious innuendo PERIOD The show is often considered Shakespeares most highbrow production littered with allusions to thencurrent political folly and foreplay PERIOD This foreplay took a more sexual turn at the Rarig PERIOD We try to make the jokes as clear and active as possible said Mitchell PERIOD The actors are physically active when telling the archaic jokes. this means that the all of the Old English is coupled frequently with mimed groping and fingers implicated as penises snaking from trousers every few minutes or so PERIOD The show entertains frequently with these gestures as well as oddly placed nonsequiturs such as contrived Russian dancing or playwithinaplay PERIOD Even though theres something to be said for opening up Shakespeare with a glass of wine this production reminds us that it never comes to life like on stage PERIOD
