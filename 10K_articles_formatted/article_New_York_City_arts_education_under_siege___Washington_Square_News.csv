1990,2023-11-04,"the Office of the New York City Comptroller recently released a reportdetailing the inadequacy of arts education provided for students living in the five boroughs PERIOD The State of the Arts report included shockingly low figures for the presence of art rooms partnerships with arts organizations and full or parttime certified arts teachers in city high middle and elementary schools PERIOD The Department of Education documented a 47percent decline in spending for arts and cultural education over the past seven years PERIOD New York City has always been celebrated as a hub of artistic expression and if it is to remain so the city needs to promote expansion of shrinking arts programs by ensuring that funds are allocated to securing arts partnerships and qualified arts teachers in public schools PERIOD

The reports executive summary begins with a conclusion The provision of arts education in New York Citys public schools has become both inequitable and underfunded. weakened by a decade of disinvestment and disincentive art is the first thing to go from struggling city schools PERIOD The reports schoolbyschool breakdown found that  percent of schools in the city lack even one fulltime arts teacher placing these schools in direct violation with New York State law that establishes minimum instruction requirements for the arts PERIOD Worse still the reduction of availability of arts education has fallen disproportionately in lowincome neighborhoods  areas whose students have more to gain from the enrichment that music dance and handson learning can provide PERIOD

Given the budget cuts that have consistently put arts education in public schools under siege those who are committed to bettering school systems should immediately devise solutionsto compensate for this inadequacy PERIOD Some parents have chosen to enroll their children in outside programs including afterschool programs at local organizations and private lessons PERIOD However a select number of parents placing their children in arts classes cannot be considered a sustainable solution PERIOD Not all families can afford this luxury whether in time or finances PERIOD Communities must band together to create advocacy plans to restore art music and drama in schools PERIOD The Kennedy Center Alliance for Arts Education Network has already recommendedthis tactic PERIOD

Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Schools Chancellor Carmen Farina both share a conviction for equity in education PERIOD If they are to act upon this conviction they must ensure that every child in the city receives the education that is guaranteed to them by state law PERIOD The arts can no longer be seen as expendable PERIOD
