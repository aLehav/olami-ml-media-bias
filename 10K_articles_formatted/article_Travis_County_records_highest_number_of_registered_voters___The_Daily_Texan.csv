We have a long way to go Elfant said PERIOD Registering to vote is not enough  if you dont follow through and vote. the deadline to register to vote in the Nov PERIOD  election is Monday at midnight and registered Travis County voters will decide on  state constitutional amendments and two local ballot measures PERIOD

The citys two propositions include votes for elections on any city lease of sports or entertainment venues and expansion of the Austin Convention Center PERIOD The constitutional amendments include a ban on the creation of a state income tax and allowing the Legislature to lower tax rates on property damaged during a disaster PERIOD

TX Votes president Anthony Zhang said the increase was largely due to the efforts of TX Votes and other student organizations under the Universitys Civic Engagement Alliance a collection of nonpartisan voterengagement organizations PERIOD

Zhang said TX Votes a UT studentorganization with the goal of educating and motivating students to participate in the voting process registered roughly  people during the  election cycle PERIOD Zhang a public health and chemistry junior said online registration makes it much easier for students to learn how to participate especially in a smaller election cycle PERIOD

Voter education is especially important in this election cycle because a lot of candidates are a lot more lowkey Zhang said PERIOD Not to say its not important the smaller election just doesnt have a lot of
candidates to put names to faces. student Government representativeKerry Mackenzie said she drafted and filed SG legislation over the weekend which would allow students to have excused absences to vote in local state and federal elections PERIOD Mackenzie said she drafted the legislation because students have said voting conflicts with classes creating a barrier to voting PERIOD She said a Student Government survey found  of students felt this way PERIOD

Civic engagement should be everyones number one prioritiy Plan II sophomore Mackenzie said PERIOD If more people are missing class to vote then theyre  having more conversations about what candidates theyd like to see and what policies theyd liketo see. students still looking to register in time to vote in the November elections can visit various places around town including the Travis County Tax Office or get registered by a volunteer deputy registrar PERIOD
