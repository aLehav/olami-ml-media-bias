YANA PASKOVAHerald Photo

First the offense will showcase eight new starters as it returns only quarterback John Stocco and linemen Joe Thomas and Kraig Urbik from the  starting lineup PERIOD But graduating seniors has always been an issue for college teams PERIOD

This year however will mark a true passing of the torch within the organization PERIOD In the first year since Barry Alvarez retired his duties as head coach Bret Bielema will encounter his first year as Alvarezs replacement and there are seven other brand new men joining him on the coaching staff PERIOD

The big question Will there be many challenges to having such a complete overhaul of the assistant coaching staff especially in a year with a firstyear head coach in Bielema

Interestingly enough the seven new assistants seemed generally split on that proposition PERIOD

 said defensive backs coach Kerry Cooks who joins the Badgers after heading the same unit at Minnesota in  PERIOD The key is having to learn seven new coaching styles maybe some different philosophies and techniques.Well I think whenever you have a new staff that there are always going to be growing painsBut Im very impressed with this staff and everybody is  working for the common goal to make this team the best that it can be PERIOD So Im optimistic that things are going to go well.Everybody that Bret brought on board is a good football coach PERIOD The games not going to changeIts just being able to motivate the guys get guys to play hard and you build from there PERIOD



Codefensive coordinator and linebackers coach Dave Doeren showed no concern over the issue PERIOD

 said Doeren who also holds the position as coordinator of UW recruiting PERIOD 

While there are some mixed emotions about the potential obstacle of new faces each coach has been visibly optimistic about Wisconsins ability to succeed in the coming year PERIOD To begin this spring Bielema has set aside the first  minutes of each practice for individual contact between position coaches and players PERIOD

And even though this past weekend marked the first interaction of such the respect that each coach seemed to command out of each Badger was notable PERIOD

 Bielema said PERIOD 

One could argue that there could be communication issues among a staff that lacks experience in unity but nobody will be able to question the coaching ability that Bielema has brought on board in his staff PERIOD

Mike Hankwitz Bielemas replacement as defensive coordinator won a national title with the Colorado Buffaloes in  and has coached in  bowl games including the Rose Orange and Fiesta Bowls PERIOD Hankwitz said he already feels right at home in a city in which he was excited to come and be a part of the football program PERIOD

 Hankwitz said PERIOD 

After spending three years at the University of Kansas under defensive coordinator Bill Young Doeren said he is excited at the opportunity to work and learn under another veteran coordinator in Hankwitz PERIOD

 Doeren said PERIOD

Settle will be responsible for developing the program that has produced such Badger greats as Alan Ameche Ron Dayne and Brian Calhoun PERIOD

With the  starting tailback spot up for grabs hell need his experience from Fresno State as well as past tutelage under Bill Belicheck Mack Brown and Jerry Glanville to help groom the collection of UW running back hopefuls PERIOD

 Settle said PERIOD 

Palcic who has flipped back and forth between coaching offensive line and tight ends in his career also knows something about working under football greats PERIOD After spending nearly two decades with seven different universities the new Badger offensive line coach has been consistently involved with four different NFL teams since  PERIOD

Palcic credited coaches such as Bobby Ross who was the head coach of the Detroit Lions in the late 1990s when Palcic was an assistant there as one of many who have helped him in becoming an experienced football coach PERIOD

 Palcic said PERIOD 

Tight ends coach Bob Bostad and defensive line coach Randall McCray round out the field of new Wisconsin assistants who along with Bielema have their work cut out for them PERIOD

But stress never seems to take hold of the youngest coach in Division I football and the same held true following Sundays practice PERIOD

 Bielema said PERIOD 

After months of meeting with each other and getting to know one another on the coaching staff each of the new Badger assistants has shown that he is encouraged by the first week of spring practice PERIOD

The general consensus was a feeling of relief a satisfactory notion that the baby steps of initial interaction between player and coach have finally begun PERIOD

 Hankwitz said PERIOD But this is the best part of the spring when you actually get to do the football part. this article was published Mar   at  am and last
