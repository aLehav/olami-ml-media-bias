5950,2023-07-11,"i was upset and disappointed by The Daily Texans decision to run an image on Wednesdays front page of a woman being photographed while flashing PERIOD The image seems to endorse and perpetuate the sexist treatment of women as sexual objects especially since there is no accompanying article to provide context PERIOD I hope in the future The Daily Texan will consider only running images and stories that will make all its readers feel respected rather than profiting from womens sexual exploitation PERIOD
