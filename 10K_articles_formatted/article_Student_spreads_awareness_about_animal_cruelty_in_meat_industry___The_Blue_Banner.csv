UNC Ashevilles Animal Rights Organization paid willing students  to watch an expos film on animal cruelty in the food trade following Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimers official proclamation designating March  as Meatout Day. were hoping that enough people will watch this video and be shocked PERIOD This is why I went vegetarian PERIOD I couldnt ignore it anymore said Carolina Arias a sophomore who started UNCAs chapter of ARO this year PERIOD
Students watched as small pigss testicles were sliced off without anaesthesia according to the film and their heads where slammed against the floor and skulls smashed PERIOD Chicks were thrown en masse into a grinder or had their beaks sliced off PERIOD
Farm to Fridge is a documentary detailing the abuse and slaughter practices of farm animals in major food production facilities nationwide PERIOD The film was produced by Mercy for Animals a nonprofit animal protection organization that is making waves not just for farms but also among big brands such as Tyson Foods and Nestleowned DiGiorno PERIOD
Its so easy in our society to ignore all the major problems that are underneath the fabric of our society PERIOD You can go to the supermarket and buy a package of meat that does not resemble at all the animal it used to be and you can just forget about where its come from PERIOD We dont want to let people forget PERIOD If youre going to be giving these companies money you need to remember what these companies do Arias said PERIOD
Mercy for Animals came under fire in recent years for undercover filming practices which led Iowa agriculture leaders to push for legislation to ban the production and distribution of these types of materials PERIOD After NBC networks showed Farm to Fridge Tyson Foods and other companies demanded their suppliers halt treatment of animals in the ways depicted PERIOD
Heimermans proclamation coincided with the eponymous annual diet education campaign PERIOD
Arias said ARO promotes the meatfree day for all the reasons the proclamation says including dietary health preservation of natural resources reducing greenhouse emissions and preventing pollution of waterways by pesticides but emphasized going meatfree is the consumers key choice in preventing animal cruelty PERIOD
On hand to support ARO were representatives from the Asheville Vegan Society and Full Circle Farm Sanctuary a nonprofit lifetime home for farmed animals PERIOD Kayla Rae Worden its founder and executive director said she hopes visitors like ARO whose members volunteered at the sanctuary in February will meet the animals and fall in love. every person who chooses to go vegan each year theyre saving  individual animals said Worden who graduated from UNCA in  with a bachelors degree in environmental science PERIOD I think everyone deserves to know where their food comes from and its kept hidden. worden said she cofounded the original animal rights group in Asheville in  and has been involved in animal activism since then PERIOD
Frank Contreras an Asheville Vegan Society member said his eating habits changed after picking out the documentary Earthlings from a library PERIOD
Earthlings focuses on animal treatment more broadly as pets entertainment and scientific research in addition to food production PERIOD Like Mercy for Animals work in Farm to Fridge undercover filming techniques were also used to produce it PERIOD
Contreras said he broke down several times while watching it but he was determined to see it through PERIOD He was in the restaurant business for  years and said he battled guilt for a long time after he saw Earthlings because he felt he had participated in animal cruelty PERIOD He became an animal rights activist then and ultimately inspired Arias to reinstate animal rights activism among students PERIOD
I want to tell people that this is an issue that they should really look into PERIOD I think a lot of people ignorantly go through life eating the American diet without really questioning the processes of how that meat gets from the factory farms to their table and I think if they knew they would question their meatcentric diet said Kelsey Gaffigan freshman ARO treasurer PERIOD I think its really important that people educate themselves in sustainability and animal rights. viewers were paid  to watch a fourminute video about animal cruelty PERIOD Photo by Valerie McMurray
