Katherine Stein Contributing WriterFeb  

The NYU College of Dentistry launched the Give Kids a Smile initiative together with the New York Public Advocate to provide free oral screenings to underserved kids across the five boroughs on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

This year the Give Kids a Smile initiative kicked off at PS  a Queens elementary school where over  children from kindergarten through fifth grade were screened throughout the day on NYUCDs Mobile Dental Van PERIOD The students also received a bag containing a toothbrush toothpaste and oral healthcare information PERIOD

Constance RobinsonTurner administrator of the Smiling Faces Going Places Mobile Dental Care Program said she recently began working with the public advocate and hoped it would improve the scope of their program PERIOD

The month of February is Give Kids a Smile month and the dental van program has always participated in providing care RobinsonTurner said PERIOD The public advocates office in this particular instance reached out to me asking if we could develop an initiative. nYUCDs Mobile Dental Care Program has worked in conjunction with the American Dental Association on their nationwide Give Kids a Smile initiative for the past  years PERIOD

NYC Public Advocate Letitia James directed the initiative this year and plans to choose a public school in each borough where the NYUCD will provide free oral screenings to students during the month
of February PERIOD

Unfortunately too many children  particularly in low income communities  go without oral healthcare because its inaccessible and unaffordable James said PERIOD Until  every school in New York City had a dental clinic PERIOD When these clinics were discontinued we did damage to our childrens health PERIOD This is why publicprivate partnerships like our Give Kids a Smile initiative are
so vital. separate from the Give Kids a Smile initiative NYUCDs Mobile Dental Care Program has brought dental services oral health care and educational programs to underserved areas in the five boroughs five days a week for the past  years PERIOD

Turner said the program seeks to offer support to children living in underprivileged communities PERIOD

The concept of the program is to make oral healthcare accessible to children living in financially distressed and typically underserved communities Turner said PERIOD We visit children in an educational setting public elementary schools and daycare centers providing comprehensive dental care. however NYUCDs Smiling Faces Going Places Mobile Dental Care Program is in jeopardy of losing funding after June according to Mark Wolff professor and chair of cardiology and comprehensive care at NYUCD PERIOD

For many many years the van was funded by the New York City Council and they will be offering a request for a proposal for medical care and the van does not appear to be a part of that thought Wolff said PERIOD There is no public support for the program PERIOD We are certainly positive that we are not going to be able to deliver free care in the same mechanism that we have at this
particular point. cancel reply
