With Christmas only weeks away local shopping malls are getting more and more packed with anxious people aiming to complete their shopping lists PERIOD But beneath all the holiday hustle and bustle is a place where shoppers can rest their feet and excite their appetites PERIOD

Since opening in  the BJs Restaurant and Brewery located at the Brea Mall has been a host to hungry locals mallrats and restaurant enthusiasts alike PERIOD

With an enticing menu selection of delectable dishes like their baby back pork ribs grilled chicken pasta turkey breast sandwich garden vegetable stuffed potato or honeycrisp chicken salad there is always something to satisfy even the pickiest patron PERIOD

My friends and I are frequent fans of the spinach  artichoke dip the best Ive had anywhere BJs famous deep dish Chicago Style pizza with barbeque chicken and for dessert we never hesitate to make room for the Pizookie a freshly baked cookie in a mini deep dish topped with vanilla bean ice cream. the BJs in Brea is one of nine locations nationwide that has its own microbrewery on site where it produces seven of its awardwinning classic beers including Tatonka Stout Jeremiah Red Ale PM Porter and the BJs Blonde PERIOD

My personal favorites are the Nutty Brewnette an Americanstyle brown ale comparable to Newcastle and the Pirhana Pale Ale PERIOD

Not a beer drinker No problem PERIOD BJs also has a full bar where guests can sip on martinis or take shots of Sambuca PERIOD

The atmosphere is super friendly with waiters resembling cast members of an Aaron Spelling drama PERIOD

It seems like no matter the time of day the place is always packed which at times can mean it will take a few minutes for your Melrose Placelooking waiter to take your order PERIOD

Regardless the good food drink and company are enough reasons to keep coming back for more PERIOD
