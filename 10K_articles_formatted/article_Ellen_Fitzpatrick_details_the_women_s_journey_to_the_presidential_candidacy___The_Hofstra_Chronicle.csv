The American womens journey to the oval office started long before Hillary Clinton ran for president in  or so Ellen Fitzpatrick explained in her lecture on Thursday Sept PERIOD  in the Fortunoff Theater in Monroe Lecture Center PERIOD She used historical context to Clintons current campaign and spoke about other womens presidential campaigns PERIOD	Her ambition alone is alienating to some and her most pestiferous critics likened her to the devil PERIOD Rather than send her to the White House there are those that would like to see her locked up in prison by Election Day Fitzpatrick said PERIOD Is this Hillary Clinton No PERIOD This is Victoria Woodhull. fitzpatricks speech began by discussing three women who ran for president before Clinton the first of whom was Woodhull PERIOD Fitzpatricks point was that whether its a woman running for president in  or  she is viewed in an extremely similar way PERIOD Woodhulls opponents compared her to the devil just as Republican candidate Ben Carson did to Clinton PERIOD
	Fitzpatrick is a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire specializing in modern American political and intellectual history PERIOD She is also the author and editor of eight books the most recent focusing on women vying for the American presidency PERIOD
I think that it is especially important to understand and consider the history behind womens struggle for equality during this election because we have to be able to  take for face value how far women have come said sophomore education major Sharleigh Carter PERIOD
	While Woodhull ran for a third party and received very few votes more successful women followed in the future PERIOD Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman to be elected to both Houses of Congress and ran for president in  PERIOD 
The third woman Fitzpatrick discussed was Shirley Chisolm who was the first AfricanAmerican to run for president with a major political party PERIOD She announced her candidacy in  and garnered more delegates than any female to run for president up until that point PERIOD
Her record was only broken by Clinton in  but even then Clinton didnt win the Democratic Partys nomination PERIOD This is the first year that a female candidate has won the nomination for a major political party in the United States PERIOD
	In winning the Democratic Partys nomination Clinton overcame barriers that sank every single one of those over  predecessors the women who ran for president at some point in time PERIOD Now thats not a reason to vote for Hillary Clinton on Election Day Fitzpatrick said PERIOD No one should vote for a presidential candidate solely on the basis of sex but neither should anyone harbor any illusions that gender doesnt matter in presidential politics and that a woman will be elected to the American presidency just as soon as there is a better female candidate. fitzpatrick explained that in voting for Clinton solely because of her sex the work that any woman candidate did to overcome stereotypes and sexism through intellect and strength is overshadowed PERIOD 
	That view ignores the critical factors that forestall previous female aspirants to the presidency it underestimates Clintons formidable political strengths  whether you like her or not  and it obscures what is unfolding in this current race Fitzpatrick said PERIOD
	Fitzpatrick made it clear that she doesnt believe anyone should vote for Clinton just because shes a woman but that people need to recognize that gender has played a role in this election PERIOD As soon as a woman is in the race the dynamic changes PERIOD
	I have to confess as the campaign went on I was shocked by the misogyny being expressed and I knew that it was real and I wasnt just making this up when many of my male friends approached me and said  You know what Susan I now know what misogyny looks like. and I havent heard that once  Ive heard it a lot said Susan Yohn a history professor who introduced Fitzpatrick at the lecture PERIOD
	Fitzpatrick ended the discussion by looking to the future examining how this election will determine the next womans journey to the White House PERIOD Its hard for me to imagine that any woman will ever again seek the office of presidency with a portfolio that remotely resembles the one that Hillary Clinton carries into this campaign PERIOD But I also suspect that  no woman will have to one this nation  whether this year or in some future election  puts in office its first woman president. please note that only current Hofstra students can become part of our staff writing team PERIOD
