In  when wine coolers and canned cocktails were popular the Michigan legislature amended its 10cent refund policy to include these bottled beverages PERIOD Today statistically each person in Michigan consumes up to  bottled drinks including water fruit juices teas and sports drinks every year without having to return the bottles for a cash refund PERIOD

New legislation has been proposed that would extend Michigans tencent bottle return policy to these other drinks PERIOD These beverages need to be included to maintain the high standards Michigan has set as one of the leading states in recycling PERIOD

The 10cent refund policy has been in effect for nearly  years and has proven itself successful in reducing pollution and promoting recycling in the state of Michigan PERIOD

Adding other bottled drinks to the states policy would prevent these containers from littering roadways and parks as well as contributing to already bulging landfills PERIOD

New drinks that didnt exist when the bill was initially passed in  now add approximately  million containers to the mass amounts of garbage spewed forth by people in Michigan yearly PERIOD These containers are just as easy to recycle as soda and alcohol containers why not include them by providing a cash incentive If such drinks had existed in bottled form in  they would have been included in the refund policy PERIOD

It is only logical that the bill should be revised to incorporate them now PERIOD

As it is Michigan recycles . percent of its bottles and cans more than any other state in the nation PERIOD The deposit law saves millions of dollars by reducing the amount of trash hauled to landfills annually by up to  tons PERIOD Including additional containers would also add to the nearly  jobs already created by recycling in Michigan PERIOD

While the bill is being revised the amount of the deposit should also be taken into consideration PERIOD Just as the cost of a stamp has been adjusted over the years to account for inflation so should the amount of the bottle deposit PERIOD

Not only would an increase in the deposit be logical it would provide more of an incentive to return cans and bottles PERIOD After all if the cost of the beverage includes the deposit they would be less likely to throw the bottle on the side of the road or one of Michigans beaches PERIOD

A higher deposit need not be implemented every year but perhaps every decade PERIOD An adjustment for inflation since  could put the cost of a current deposit adjusted for inflation at  to  cents an ample amount to make someone think twice about throwing a container into the garbage PERIOD At the University recycling is easy enough PERIOD Containers labeled specifically for containers paper etc PERIOD can be found in every University building around campus PERIOD  However in the world outside the University recycling takes more effort PERIOD Steps taken by the legislature to encourage recycling and to make it easier for residents should be met with approval PERIOD

The policy was originally passed as an initiative approved by voters to provide incentive to recycle PERIOD Todays proposal to include water juice tea and sports drinks containers must be approved by threefourths of the legislature to pass PERIOD There is absolutely no reason that it should not PERIOD

As an environmentally conscious University community it is our responsibility to show support for the preservation of resources and to encourage the state government to continue its efforts to improve the environment of this great state PERIOD
