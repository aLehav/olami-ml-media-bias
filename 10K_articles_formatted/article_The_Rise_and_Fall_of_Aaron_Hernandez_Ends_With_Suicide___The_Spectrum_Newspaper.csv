While it was originally reported that Hernandez did not leave any suicide notes it
appears that three suicide notes and a bible were left in the prison cell PERIOD Hernandez also wrote a bible verse John  on his forehead PERIOD

According to Fox News the words were written with a red marker and a Bible was left open to the lines of the passage in the Bible PERIOD The verse reads For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. i think that him using suicide to escape his life of punishment for his horrible actions is unfair to the people he hurt and for people with mental health issues that contemplate suicide every day because of their pain said junior Rebecca Lee PERIOD

Boston University researchers will study Hernandezs brain to determine if he suffered from the same degenerative brain disease as Hall of Famer Junior Seau and former Bears defensive back Dave Duerson who also took their own lives PERIOD That brain disease is chronic traumatic encephalopathy also known as CTE PERIOD

Hernandez is survived by his longtime fiance Shayanna Jenkins and their four year old daughter PERIOD

I think its a story of someone who had so much more to give in life but he could not escape his past connections even with the money and fame PERIOD It is sad for a daughter that will grow up without a father said senior Chris Butler PERIOD
