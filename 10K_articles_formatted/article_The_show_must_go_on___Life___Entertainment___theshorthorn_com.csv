A pregnancy PERIOD A baby PERIOD A birth defect PERIOD A show PERIOD A lot has changed in the past year for Kristina Broadway PERIOD

Broadway a theater arts senior transferred to UTA for the Theater Department PERIOD Two semesters into classes she became pregnant and later gave birth to a daughter who needed multiple surgeries to correct a lifethreatening birth defect PERIOD After overcoming the stress from classes and her daughters struggles Broadway was cast in As It Is In Heaven which reignited her passion for acting and ambition to direct and teach PERIOD

After taking a semester off to have the baby Broadway spoke with her husband Patrick Stephens and they agreed it was important for Broadway to finish school PERIOD

I didnt want Kadence to think that just because you start a family and begin your life you cant go after your dreams and attain them Broadway said PERIOD

School wasnt the only challenge Broadway faced PERIOD Her daughter Kadence was diagnosed with Pierre Robin sequence a condition where an infants jaw is too small and can have trouble breathing PERIOD A sleep study showed Kadence stopped breathing several times during the night PERIOD

Kadence underwent multiple surgeries to correct the problem but every surgery came with setbacks PERIOD Each time Broadway and her husband had to patiently reteach Kadence how to eat PERIOD

She would get an aversion to having liquid in her mouth Broadway said She didnt want anything in her mouth. for a couple of hours a day classes provided Broadway with a small distraction from the stress of Kadences recovery PERIOD

I think Ive been good and strong for it but it has been really hard seeing her go through this Broadway said PERIOD

As a BFA performance student Broadway was expected to audition for shows this semester PERIOD In what became her debut performance at UTA she was cast as Rachel in the play As It Is In Heaven under the direction of her faculty mentor theater assistant professor Anne Healy PERIOD Healy said Broadway has grown during the development of the play which is about nine devout women who try to live flawless lives but struggle to break free and accept new things PERIOD

This has been a wonderful opportunity for her to really have an extended time period on stage and start to discover all that shes capable of Healy said PERIOD The play is about human nature and how we strive for an ideal utopian society PERIOD Being human is difficult PERIOD None of us are perfect. people can relate that theme of imperfection and acceptance to life today not just Shakers in the 1830s Healy said PERIOD Broadway said Healy is the first director shes known to be so involved and passionate about theater PERIOD Watching Healy insert herself into the rehearsal has been so effective Broadway said she is inspired to do the same PERIOD

Being cast in As It Is In Heaven has really changed my life and reaffirmed my passion for directing Broadway said PERIOD

Now Broadway is using the struggles she went through with Kadence to enrich her performance PERIOD In a scene Broadway refers to as her testimony her character Rachel defends herself when her faith is questioned PERIOD

I think the audience is going to be surprised at how it makes them feel Broadway said PERIOD You wouldnt think that some show about the 1830s Shaker society of Pleasantville Ky. would be lifechanging but it really can be. if she continues on track Broadway will have two courses left in the spring semester before she earns her degree PERIOD With everything that has happened Broadway says shes thankful for her husband Patrick PERIOD

Ive never had this sort of support where its like Yes go and do PERIOD Reach your dream  Broadway said PERIOD

In addition to rehearsals for As It Is In Heaven Broadway directs and acts in 10minute plays and is learning scripts and songs for several other classes PERIOD Occasionally she misses bath time and bedtime but Stephens said he respects her dedication PERIOD

Kadence will always know that no matter what life throws at you you should always follow your dreams and always finish what you start Stephens said PERIOD Shell know that because of the role model Kristi has been. every free moment for Broadway is spent with Kadence even lunch breaks when possible PERIOD

Im proud of myself for what Ive accomplished but shes my driving force behind it Broadway said PERIOD When its too hard or stressful and I want to give up I see her face and she makes it OK.
