Unpaid internships do have stipulations from the Department of Labor The internship must be intended to benefit the intern the intern cannot replace regular employees they are not necessarily guaranteed a job at the conclusion of the internship and it must be clear to the intern before they are hired that they will not be paid PERIOD The idea is that a student or recent graduate is gaining the experience necessary to succeed in their career field through reallife experience PERIOD

Joe Hayes the assistant director of UNOs Academic and Career Development Center said that if the primary beneficiary of the internship is the student intern then legally it can be unpaid PERIOD

That said the vast majority of available posted internships remain of the paid variety as employers know that in order to be competitive and attract interns  they must pay Hayes said PERIOD

A great system in theory and for some students devoting time to an unpaid position is entirely doable and rewarding PERIOD However for many students the  hours a week they might have to spend as an unpaid intern results in a loss of roughly  a month they would be making at a minimum wage job PERIOD This is  that could go to rent utilities groceries or tuition PERIOD

So is the experience truly worth the loss of income Hayes said it depends PERIOD

Naturally its better for individuals to be paid than not to be paid for work PERIOD That said an internship should not be categorized as a parttime job Hayes said PERIOD An internship is more about exploring a new field and learning from others  an extension of the classroom often guided by an outside professional  if you will. hayes also added that if a student hopes to enter a field where unpaid internships are the norm such as nonprofits and can gain new skills and experience then yes an unpaid internship seems worthwhile. however the reality is that unpaid internships dont fit in with everyones life and comes with an opportunity cost of missing out on wages that a paid opportunity affords Hayes said PERIOD In this case Id want a clear understanding of the internship duties who would be providing the supervised training and to think through how this opportunity could offer career clarity. according to a report released by Bloomberg in  over the past  years the cost of higher education has risen by  percent PERIOD A trend likely to continue in Nebraska as the state continues to diverge funding away from the NU system PERIOD This reality of highcosting education an increasingly competitive job market and the cycle of unpayable student loans makes it difficult for students to devote  hours of unpaid labor to an internship PERIOD

Perhaps though a better question than the paid versus unpaid internship debate may be why would anyone pass on an experience that can connect classroom lessons to a realworld setting Hayes said PERIOD

Unfortunately the decision to pass on such an opportunity is a choice between making rent for the month and possibly advancing in a chosen career field PERIOD

For students seeking advice on resumes internships job interviews or anything else necessary to career development UNOs ACDC office located in room  of the Eppley Administration Building is ready to offer expertise and answer questions PERIOD
