The Penn State club baseball team swept Carnegie Mellon behind its strong pitching PERIOD

Other than the thrill of dominating victory this past weekend against Carnegie Mellon the Penn State club baseball team  felt a rush of cool early spring air as most opposing batters could do nothing except create wind with their bats PERIOD

Outscoring the Tartans  over the threegame competition the team was led by pitchers Pete Chalfin Brian Binder Dave Brodeur and Jason Shirey all of whom contributed to the  innings of dominance over the clearly weaker Carnegie Mellon squad PERIOD

Chalfin the teams ace as a sophomore threw a fiveinning nohitter striking out eight and giving up only two free passes PERIOD

 Chalfin said PERIOD 

Being a part of a combined nohitter last season Chalfin was able to experience the first of his career against a Carnegie Mellon team that was just becoming accustomed to the new conference PERIOD

 pitching coach Bill Lippert said PERIOD

By working ahead and throwing strikes the pitching staff was able to display a mastery over opposing batters even at an somewhat early stage in the season PERIOD And at Carnegie Mellon on Saturday it occurred in what could have been considered nonbaseball weather PERIOD

Even with the success this past weekend in Pittsburgh however head coach Buck Kicinski has not let the team waver from their focus on the remainder of the season and the notsodistant playoff period PERIOD

 Kicinski said to his team before practice Monday PERIOD With a definite opportunity to win a national championship this season the coaches have been stressing the concept of teamwork even to a squad of  talented players PERIOD

 Kicinski said PERIOD 

Even after a series of games like this past weekend where multiple players had accumulated numbers that would make a fantasy baseball owner drool the team is trying to break from the notion of individual accomplishment PERIOD

 Kicinski said PERIOD 

With just what will feel like a brief twoandahalf months left in the club baseball season the Lions who have come a long way will be preparing for their national championship run in May PERIOD

 Kicinski said PERIOD

So as the team hosts Robert Morris this first weekend in April the Lions will be looking to gain experience form memories strengthen friendships and become closer as a team in hopes of bringing home a championship to Happy Valley this year PERIOD

 Kicinski said PERIOD
