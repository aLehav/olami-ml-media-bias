When I saw the headline The Elephant in the Room in the Letters to the Editor in the Feb PERIOD  edition of The Amherst Student I was looking forward to reading about Alcohol and Substance Abuse on the Amherst Campus PERIOD In the parlance of substance abuse counseling the elephant in the room refers to the denial of the devastating effects of alcohol and substance abuse in the personal life of the individual PERIOD I was surprised to read that the elephant in the living room of Professor Dumm is athletics PERIOD I will admit that I have no academic studies to back up my opinion PERIOD I will also admit that I am an alumnus and a fan of sports at the College PERIOD I appreciate this opportunity in the open forum of Letters to the Editor to express my thoughts PERIOD

When I relate my experience as an undergraduate at Amherst College I joking say that Amherst College taught me to think and drink PERIOD In fact the only time I was sober for any length of time at Amherst was the  weeks I was on the freshman football team PERIOD The other  percent of the my college career was spent in an alcoholic haze PERIOD I am grateful that I was taught the meaning of no by my parents and was able to avoid any serious sexual indiscretions while in that haze PERIOD At  years of age I fulfilled my lifetime requirement for the use and abuse of alcohol and mindaltering substances PERIOD In my forties through my early sixties with a clear mind I discovered athletics and the endorphins that strenuous exercise produce as an alternative to the false endorphins that alcohol and mindaltering substances produce PERIOD Athletics has been a very positive experience in my life PERIOD My first marathon gave me confidence PERIOD My first Boston Marathon gave me selfesteem PERIOD My first finish in a 100mile race me faith that I could do anything PERIOD What athletics has given me is immeasurable PERIOD

Wishing to avoid artificial knees in my old age I have endured my running career PERIOD I have supplanted that career by becoming a fan of Amherst athletics PERIOD I consider myself friends with a majority of the athletic department PERIOD There is no greater group of people than those whom Athletic Director Suzanne Coffey has assembled PERIOD They are dedicated teachers in their fields PERIOD They have committed their lives as have the professors at the College to raise responsible intelligent and healthy adults PERIOD The studentathletes I have met conversed with and become friends with make me proud that I am part of the tradition of Amherst College PERIOD Their involvement in the LEADS programs and the Center for Community Engagement teaches them to be responsible representatives in the larger community PERIOD I am sure that student athletes at Amherst College are very similar to the rest of the student body PERIOD

I would certainly enjoy spending any amount of time with Professor Dumm and anyone else in the Amherst College community discussing our respective elephants athletics and alcohol and substance abuse and their respective relationships to serious sexual indiscretions PERIOD",Letter to the Editor,Amherst College
