Harriers excited to start season at home

As the Red Simmons Invitational is typically the first big meet
of the year for the Michigan mens track and field team it
is only fitting that the event serves as the stage for the return
of the teams leading runners PERIOD Held at the Indoor Track
Building the meet will give hometown fans the first look of their
indoor season at junior Nate Brannen last years 800meter
indoor national champion and sophomore Nick Willis PERIOD

Although their top runners are returning other members of the
team are still doing their best to improve PERIOD

Honestly Im excited to see Brannen and Willis
run freshman Chris Stowe said But everyone is still
focused on their events PERIOD Their presence will make our team better
because they are two talented runners. the meet gives the Wolverines another shot at intrastate rivals
Michigan State Eastern Michigan and Grand Valley State PERIOD Hillsdale
and Pittsburgh will also be running PERIOD There will be no team score
but Michigan is still hoping to improve on its performances from
the last meets PERIOD

I feel that we have a team that is growing in talent and
despite the fact that we are young we should be
competitive Stowe said PERIOD

Track fans can look for some exciting races as last
years meet included several NCAA provisional performances
including Willis in the 3000meter run PERIOD

The Fish receives donation for lights

The Michigan Athletic Department announced that a former
Michigan baseball player anonymously donated  to construct
lights at Ray Fisher Stadium PERIOD The renovations are scheduled for
completion in March PERIOD

The Wolverines will host three night games the first coming
against rival Michigan State on April  PERIOD Michigan also plays
Western Michigan on May  and Penn State on May  under the
lights PERIOD

The addition of lights to Fisher Stadium continues to
show the support that the Michigan baseball program has received
from the University and the alumni since I have been here
said Rich Maloney who is in his second year as head coach PERIOD
Our goal is to get Michigan baseball back in the national
spotlight and the addition of the lights along with other projects
this offseason including the leveling of the infield and new
dugouts helps put us on track. eric Ambinder
