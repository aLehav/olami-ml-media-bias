Meanwhile the relatively nonviolent revolution in Yugoslavia has given much of the world a new sense of optimism in the belief that a people can overcome a tyrannical leader PERIOD After much propaganda manipulation and fraud former President Slobodan Milosevic conceded defeat Friday to Kostunica a constitutional lawyer in the original Sept PERIOD  elections PERIOD President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright were quick to reveal their elation and offer their support for the new leader PERIOD The United States and other nations would be wise however to respect the Kostunicas wishes and avoid requesting Milosevics extradition to The Hague for a war crimes trial PERIOD
Ideally Yugoslavias former ruler would give himself up offering his apologies to the thousands he indirectly helped murder during his  years in office PERIOD But we must be pragmatic PERIOD
If Kostunica were to arrest Milosevic and send him to the Netherlands for western justice turmoil would again engulf Yugoslavia as the military and onethird of parliament still swear their allegiance to Milosevic PERIOD Many Serbians would then consider Kostunica a puppet of the western powers as Milosevic depicted him during the election PERIOD
Albright and Clinton must be careful not to exacerbate the situation any further and instead continue toward relieving the economically detrimental sanctions imposed within the last four years PERIOD
For some reason it does not seem unusual that while one politically and religiously volatile region unravels through bloodletting another discovers a new stability with a more democratic leader PERIOD Perhaps just as local conflicts have spread from this region and resulted in world wars peace and democracy could emerge and positively impact Middle Eastern affairs PERIOD Some dream PERIOD
