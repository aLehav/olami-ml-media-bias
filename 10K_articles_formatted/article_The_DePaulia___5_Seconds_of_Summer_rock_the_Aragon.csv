September  

This is my favorite show lead vocalist Luke Hemmings of  Seconds of Summer told the soldout crowd at the groups Sept PERIOD  show at Aragon Ballroom PERIOD I know youre thinking Luke says this at every show but I really mean it when I say this is one my of favorite shows. seconds of Summer is a Sydneybased pop rock group comprised of Hemmings guitarist Michael Clifford bassist Calum Hood and drummer Ashton Irwin PERIOD The group had humble beginningstheir career started by posting covers of popular songs on YouTube throughout  and  but quickly secured their spots on the charts after supporting One Direction on their international Take Me Home and Where We Are tours PERIOD

After a threeyear hiatus from recording the band came back with a bang with the release of their third studio album Youngblood in June PERIOD Following the criticallyacclaimed success of the releaseeven beating out Beyonc and Jay Z for the No PERIOD  spot on the Billboard  the group set out on their Meet You There tour and found their way back to Chicago  this time with The Aces PERIOD

Lead vocalist Cristal Ramirez guitarist Katie Henderson bassist McKenna Petty and drummer Alisa Ramirez comprise the indie opening act PERIOD Fresh off the success of their debut album When My Heart Felt Volcanic the girl group joined forces with  Seconds of Summer to provide support for the U.S PERIOD leg of the tour PERIOD

The deafening cheers could be heard outside the venue as The Aces began their set PERIOD The connection between the group and the audience did not falter throughout the entirety of the performance PERIOD As the group departed from the stage after thanking fans a sense of longing filled the ballroom almost as if an encore was to occur but one never did PERIOD

The feeling of longing for The Aces to return was quickly replaced with anticipation as fans eagerly awaited the beginning of  Seconds of Summers set PERIOD The suspense only built further as any sense of movement onstage caused massive cheersespecially when stagehands uncovered Irwins drum set PERIOD

After what felt like hours the group finally took the stage and started off the evening with Babylon. talk Fast and Moving Along were up next PERIOD

The band then took a trip down memory lane with their hit song Shes Kinda Hot. this piecewhich was a staple of the groups Rock Out with Your Socks Out tourshowed just how far the group had come in terms of their sound since their formation PERIOD This progress was only exemplified with Girls Talk Boys the groups contribution to the  Ghostbusters soundtrack PERIOD

Their newest album became the focus of the show once again as Waste the Night More Better Man and If Walls Could Talk were up next PERIOD Irwins drumming dominated this portion of the performance as his solos radiated through my chest as the ballroom was illuminated by purple and turquoise lights PERIOD

Things slowed down with Ghost of You as cell phone screens and flashlights overpowered the light blue strobes from the stage to light the venue PERIOD

The rock came to a complete halt with an acoustic rendition of Amnesia. clifford carefully strummed his acoustic guitar while all four members of the group harmonized with fans PERIOD Regardless of ones connection to the song and its meaning the connection between the group and fans was at an alltime high PERIOD The effort on part of the audience in the ballad was so powerful that the band took a moment to applaud their fans upon its completion PERIOD

All of the lights within the ballroom dimmed as Clifford took center stage to introduce The Only Reason. hemmings then approached the piano situated on the left side of the stage PERIOD The opening chords to Lie to Me began as Hemmings powerful vocals filled the venue PERIOD Once again the audience aided the group in the delivery of this song with their harmonization towards the end PERIOD Why Wont You Love Me Valentine and Meet You There preceded another throwback anthem Jet Black Heart. as expected the groups encore truly stole the show PERIOD New and old fans alikerocked out the hardest to She Looks So Perfect and Youngblood. the nostalgic feeling that resulted with Shes Kinda Hot returned once again as the group poured their hearts and souls into the delivery of She Looks So Perfect as it was groups claim to fame in  PERIOD

Before departing the band took the center stage to take their signature bow to close out the show PERIOD This seemingly small gesture actually contains a much deeper meaningthat no matter how far this group goes theyll always remain close to their roots PERIOD
