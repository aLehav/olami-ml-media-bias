7634,1970-01-01,"most of us want to believe that the WashingtonOregon rivalry means something to everyone PERIOD

We like to think of the rivalry as one of the most bitter matchups in the nation despite its lack of national attention PERIOD

Unfortunately for fans of both teams the rivalry doesnt mean squat outside of the Northwest PERIOD

In recent years Oregon has become the en vogue college for California kids myself included and the football teams recruiting methods scream that California is the hotbed for prospects PERIOD

And frankly they dont care about a Northwest rivalry thats supposed to be so important that it hasnt even been officially named PERIOD Theres no catch phrase to identify the yearly match like the Civil War or Apple Cup PERIOD

Because its been nameless for so long who outside of the region is going to hear about it

Not Californiabred football recruits and students who come to the Northwest PERIOD

For most of us our experience with college rivalries either stems from the tepidatbest CalStanford rivalry where alumni debate who donates more money to the school to the battle for SoCal supremacy where UCLA and USC are the only two football teams fighting for attention PERIOD

Coming from these two extremes the Bay Areas apathy toward college sports to L.A.s turf battle Californians dont care about a rivalry theyve never heard of PERIOD

I understand Oregon and Washington fans try to hype the game in rivalry fashion but it still hasnt received any sort of national attention that other schools are used to PERIOD

Although Oregon fans claim the The Pick as the defining moment in the rivalry I had never heard of it before I attended my first home game and watched it on the big replay screen PERIOD

In the CalStanford rivalry any college football fan can identify the marching band fiasco touchdown as a moment that symbolized its rivalry PERIOD

Even though I believe the Ducks and Huskies have a far more intense rivalry than the Cardinal and Golden Bears in a national sense people can point to the marching band play and immediately recognize it as a moment thats symbolic of the teams feelings toward each other PERIOD

The Ducks and Huskies need that type of iconic moment for anyone outside the region to care PERIOD

With Washington coach Tyrone Willingham bringing the program back to respectability and soontobe prominence the rivalry looks to be a heated contest in the upcoming years and maybe one of those moments will occur PERIOD

It has to if the rivalry is going to receive any attention PERIOD

After learning from previous experiences Mike Bellotti wont let his players hype the matchup by making disparaging remarks about the Huskies PERIOD And Willingham is too reserved and classy to let his players get media attention PERIOD

Or maybe no one wants to be recognized at the national level PERIOD Because who cares about the annual battles between other regions Sure the Ohio StateMichigan games are fun to watch but how many of us care about the history of the teams

Maybe we should just keep the rivalry a secret and enjoy it ourselves PERIOD
