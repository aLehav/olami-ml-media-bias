img1Hard Candy is the sort of thriller that makes you cringe and wish you were not sitting in the theater watching it yet captivates you and makes you watch it all the same PERIOD The terror in this movie is not blunt gore and horror as in some films it is a deeply rooted psychological terror that is borne of our social infrastructure and which grows into a frightful reality in the movie PERIOD

Haley Ellen Page meets Jeff Patrick Wilson in a cafe after they meet on the Internet PERIOD She is extremely smart and more mature than her age PERIOD He is a cultured photographer enamored with her personality PERIOD She is  PERIOD He is  PERIOD As the story progresses Haley and Patrick wind up back at his house she makes them drinks  because you shouldnt take a drink you havent mixed yourself  and he takes some photos of her PERIOD

Then Jeff passes out all of the sudden and wakes up to find himself tied to a chair with Haley interrogating him about his intentions and his past PERIOD She accuses him of being a child molester and even alludes to the murder of a young girl she knew who went missing PERIOD

The tables turn back and forth throughout the film as Jeff struggles free at one point and Haley painfully wrestles him back to the ground PERIOD A good portion of the film involves Haley sadistically threatening Jeff with castration if he does not give up his secrets PERIOD In between interrogating Jeff and fighting him Haley shows her skills as a detective and computer whiz searching his computer files and every square inch of the house for any elusive evidence of his pedophilia PERIOD

Nothing in Hard Candy is one simple and one sided PERIOD The characters are both extremely complex and while watching this film there were times at which I wondered who the real victim and who the real villain was PERIOD

The very opening shots of the film  a saucy slice of an instantmessage conversation followed by a closeup of Haley biting into a creamy chocolate desert  and the way in which it is shot make it difficult to stomach from the beginning PERIOD Director David Slade and writer Brian Nelson use anticipation and hints at gore to tighten their grip on their audience in a way which no gruesome film ever could PERIOD

Yet this is a very well made very powerful film PERIOD Everything is put together in Hard Candy its just difficult to swallow PERIOD

The intensity of Ellen Pages performance is stunningly gripping and is one of the reasons that the film works so well PERIOD At the same time Patrick Wilson is frighteningly approachable in a passionate performance as Jeff PERIOD Their performances are even more admirable as the film is primarily these two characters squaring off against each other PERIOD Sandra Oh even makes a brief appearance as a concerned neighbor late in the film PERIOD

Hard Candy is difficult to watch it is absolutely terrifying and it focuses on a controversial subject that is all too familiar in todays society yet every frame every line from this script demands to be seen PERIOD

When you sit down in the theatre prepare to be profoundly scared in a way that few movies can manage PERIOD Hard Candy will chill you PERIOD
