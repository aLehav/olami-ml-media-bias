The week wraps up with a presentation by Saint Marys senior Christina Grasso PERIOD Grasso will present her senior comprehensive project entitled The Cult of Thinness in Fashion Industry at noon in conference room A in the Student Center PERIOD

The presentation will highlight interviews with models and fashion industry professionals Grasso has worked with in the past and their views on the concept of thinness in the fashion world PERIOD

Grasso has interned with Elite Model Management during New York Fashion Week in  and  PERIOD She also interned with Nanette Lepore at the most recent fashion week in February PERIOD

These internships have altered her perception of the fashion world and its impact on the public PERIOD

We only see the finished product  the glossy images of seemingly flawless women Grasso said PERIOD What most people do not see though is the heavy preparation that goes into a photo or runway show  the hours of hair and makeup and photo editing PERIOD

Fashion at its core is a business and its purpose is to sell clothing PERIOD But somewhere along the line it has become less about selling confectionary designs and more about selling a bodytype as a utopian lifestyle PERIOD I am absolutely in love with the fashion industry but I have to be mindful of my own innate values. grasso stresses the importance of Love Your Body Week on an allwomens campus PERIOD

In todays society as a whole there is an idea that there is only one kind of beauty and that perfection is the vehicle to success and happiness Grasso said PERIOD It is in this relentless pursuit though that we find anything but PERIOD Quirks and socalled imperfections are what make a person interesting unique and beautiful. grasso also said this week is especially important because it provides an open forum for women to talk about their concerns achievements and aspirations PERIOD

SGA will also be distributing Tshirts and buttons in the Student Center today and during Grassos presentation at no cost to the students PERIOD

I dont want people to have to pay to love their body Glaub said PERIOD

All events are free and open to the public PERIOD
