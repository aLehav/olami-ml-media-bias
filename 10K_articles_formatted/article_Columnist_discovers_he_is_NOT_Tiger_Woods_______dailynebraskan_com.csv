STEVE WILLEY is a senior newseditorial major and a Daily Nebraskan columnist PERIOD

Mark Twain once said that playing golf was an excellent way to ruin a good walk PERIOD Now I have always thought Mr PERIOD Twain to be a man way ahead of his time but despite my feelings on the mans wisdom a lot of other folks dont share his views about the game PERIOD

Today golf has young studs like Tiger Woods a man who has singlehandedly resurrected the popularity of the sport PERIOD His often amazing shots have lured just about everyone into being golf fans PERIOD Old men who before had a difficult time remembering where they lived can now successfully recall whats par for the fifth hole at a particular private golf course in Turkey PERIOD And expecting fathers are now dangling baby golf shoes in front of places baby golf shoes were never meant to be dangled PERIOD

Even I was bit by the golfing bug when Tiger came along PERIOD Sure I had played a little with my father when I was growing up but he never instilled a firm grasp of the true goals of the game PERIOD For example up until I turned  I thought the sole objective in golf was to consume as many beers as ones finances permitted and eventually to purposely drive ones golf cart into a water hazard PERIOD

I quit playing golf in  when my father was permanently banned from all Mississippi golf courses after he  all of the golf holes in my hometown by about  feet PERIOD He has since been reduced to playing a sport he calls  at the WalMart parking lot PERIOD The object of this game Im told is to get the ball into the tailpipe of a predetermined car or truck at the other end of the lot PERIOD My father claims its just as fun as the old sport only 

Ordinarily this display of family stupidity would be enough to quell even my golfing desires and it did for a while PERIOD But ever since Tiger won the Masters Tournament this year Ive been teeing up the ol dimpled ball on a regular basis PERIOD Soon after I take my first swipe however I quickly realize that I have no earthly business being on a golf course PERIOD

Tiger makes it look so easy PERIOD His wellmaintained form and beaming smile make it easy for folks to misconstrue the difficulty of the game PERIOD I even tried to dress like Tiger but it sure as hell doesnt help me play like him PERIOD Now you may be asking yourself  Well Im glad you asked PERIOD I realize most of you will never have the opportunity to watch Tiger play golf in person PERIOD And likewise most of you will never have the misfortune of watching me play PERIOD Therefore I would like to do a few impersonations of the many  and very different  sounds Tiger and I might make while playing the game

SOUND ONE by Tiger  This is the sound of an excellent 375yard Tiger tee shot. sOUND ONE by Steve  This is the sound of me sending the ball an astounding two feet behind me hurling my 1wood into an oak tree and then proceeding to kick a stray puppy in the jaw. sOUND TWO  This is the sound of Tiger chipping the ball within two feet of the hole much to the delight of the crowd. sOUND TWO  This is the sound of me slicing the ball onto a neighboring green and trying unsuccessfully to warn a priest that my golf ball is heading straight for his nose PERIOD The  is a noise I have often tried to duplicate when Im alone at home PERIOD But oddly Im only able to produce the noise when I strike a man of God with an object of some sort PERIOD Its a very hard sound to describe in written words though I suppose it is not unlike the noise a cat makes when you catch it watching a pornographic film. sOUND THREE  This is the sound of Tiger mopping his brow and taking a sip of bottled Evian water after scoring  under par. sOUND THREE  This is the sound of me being quite displeased and totally exhausted after missing the ball  times in a row then sloshing towards a tree and sticking my head inside the water cooler where I am promptly  by several hairy fat men who were waiting in line before me. i suppose golf like most things in life is not as easy as the pros make it look PERIOD I mean ordinarily people dont watch one episode of  and go out and try to put in a new septic system PERIOD So why should golf be any different

I hate to say it but maybe Mark Twain was wrong PERIOD Maybe golf isnt just an excellent way to ruin a good walk PERIOD Maybe golfs just a better way to ruin your chances of getting into heaven PERIOD
