9351,2021-11-30,"on Nov PERIOD  at  a.m. detectives with the Sonoma County Sheriffs Department served a search warrant and raided the former mayor of Windsor Dominic Foppolis house seizing  electronic devices to help aid in an ongoing sevenmonth long investigation PERIOD

Last May Foppoli reluctantly stepped down as mayor after he was accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and misconduct by nine different women These women have accused Foppoli of sexual assault abuse or harassment between the years of  to early  PERIOD Foppoli has denied all allegations that began to surface in April and has yet to be charged with a crime PERIOD

According to the Press Democrat Sonoma County Sheriffs Office spokesman Sgt PERIOD Juan Valencia said the search warrant was the first served in the ongoing investigation into Foppoli. the search warrant that was issued Nov PERIOD  allowed investigators to search Foppolis electronic devices and data PERIOD This included his browser history bookmarks and favorited web page as well as searching two of his cars PERIOD The search was conducted to obtain evidence that would help in proving that a felony has been committed PERIOD

According to court documents the devices taken from Foppolis home include two laptops three iPads a cell phone a recording device a camera a USB drive and a CD PERIOD

Investigators were searching for photographs that depict a Jane Doe  in  and a Jane Doe  in  PERIOD By law a judge would not have permitted investigators to search Foppolis property unless they had presented a strong case that the seized electronics held evidence of crimes according to Kathleen Pozzi a recently retired public attorney in Sonoma County PERIOD

Usually the Sonoma County District Attorneys Office DA would approve the warrant before a judge to establish probable cause but because current Windsor council member Esther Lemus is one of many alleged victims the DAs office recused itself PERIOD

It cant be on a hunch Pozzi said according to the San Francisco Chronicle PERIOD There had to be something sufficient enough for a court to sign a warrant PERIOD That just tells me that theres something. the San Francisco Chronicle also reports that the raid was a result of a new claim of sexual assault against Foppoli that a woman had made just a few weeks prior PERIOD The Sonoma County Sheriffs office confirmed on Nov PERIOD  that about a month ago an additional woman told investigators about a sexual assault that allegedly occured while Foppoli was an elected official PERIOD

Traci Carillo a former prosecutor who is representing several of the alleged victims including the most recent woman said the alleged assault would fall within Californias statute of limitations for prosecuting sex crimes PERIOD

Many members of the community have expressed their concerns with the investigation taking so long however if a search warrant is executed prematurely it could hurt the prosecutions case PERIOD

According to SoCoNews Valencia said With the Dominic Foppoli case this is a very complex investigation...We want to make sure were turning over every stone and looking in every corner to make sure were not missing anything. carrillo told KRCB that the developments made on Nov PERIOD  suggest an arrest is coming PERIOD She added she has concerns that some evidence may have been lost concealed or destroyed in the months since the allegations emerged PERIOD

In addition to the local investigation a second investigation is proceeding in Florida as Farrah Abraham a former reality television star reported to the Palm Beach police in April that Foppoli assaulted her at the end of March PERIOD

Abrahams attorney Spencer Kuvin said that Abraham had physical and digital evidence from the encounter with Foppoli and has turned it over to the police PERIOD He also confirmed Abraham has been in contact with Sonoma County investigators PERIOD

Foppoli is also the subject of two state investigations into potential violations of Californias campaign and political ethics laws PERIOD
