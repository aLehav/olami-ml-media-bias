The first of the rounds was the infamous swimsuit competition PERIOD This had Stevenson in a modest snorkel and life vest ensemble but he was slightly outdone by Ray Saunders who impressed the ladies in the crowd with his physique PERIOD

One by one they came out in the next round to show off their talents. rappas talent was pretending to be a rapping Mets fan PerrasDuenas did a commendable job of trying his best to keep the audience engaged despite choosing to play an acoustic instrumental PERIOD

Saunders act upstaged them all PERIOD Walking onto the stage with a woman Saunders was dressed in suspenders glasses and slacks PERIOD It was an inevitability that some of those clothes were coming off and when they did every woman in the audience declared Wooo. whether or not simulated sex is a talent it certainly received a positive reaction from the allfemale judging panel PERIOD

Jessica Allan president of the hall council from Barrows Hall and one of the judges said before the contest started that she was looking forward to the bathing suits and some really good talent. while Saunders sang to his costar Allen was just right of the stage fanning herself PERIOD

With the talent and swimsuit competition of the contest over with the men were called on stage for the last time to display their formal attire and answer questions from the audience PERIOD

All were dressed to impress but PerrasDuenas left the biggest impression of this round PERIOD From head to toe he was a spitting image of The Dark Knights Joker which won him the Most Creative Formal Wear award PERIOD

Before he answered his question of What is your dream date he couldnt keep himself from having fun with the nights MC Steve Schumacher with his delivery of the Why so serious monologue from the Batman film PERIOD

The judges went to deliberate and count votes while Meg Dwyer coordinator for the night handed out roses as thanks to the people that made the night possible PERIOD
