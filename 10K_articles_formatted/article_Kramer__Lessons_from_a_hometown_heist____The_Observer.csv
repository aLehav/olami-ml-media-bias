David Kramer  Wednesday January  

Among the twenty-first centurys most prevalent mantras the invitation to do the right thing even when no one is watching proves the hardest to accept PERIOD Anyone with a devil on their shoulder and a WiFi connection can see the beautifully tantalizing fruits that the temptation of dishonesty bears PERIOD

Here sports become a particularly interesting case PERIOD Something about professional leagues infrastructure leaves honest men and women uncontrollably defeated and isolated PERIOD In light of the Houston Asterisks recent fallout the call for integrity feels swallowed by its enticing alternative nice guys finish last PERIOD When baseballs men of integrity spend their October on an old couch dog in arm watching cheaters fool the nation under its nose sometimes I think about them turning to their wives and children and wondering how long they should wait before leveling the playing field PERIOD

It remains undisputed that punishment finds the crime of the dishonest whether it comes in the form of legal retribution or social dysfunction PERIOD But in the modern era athletes wrestle with a much more complicated question does the punishment find the crime too late

Enter the greatest and maybe the only story of my hometown on the outskirts of the Twin Cities PERIOD

On March   I woke up to a wave of text messages from friends and family flooding my phone PERIOD Early that morning local police officers arrested the president of the Hamel Athletic Club Edward Leuthner for a massive embezzlement scandal that had hovered over my organization for years PERIOD Leuthner concealed his theft of over  by documenting largescale transactions with the clubs equipment provider Xtreme Custom Apparel PERIOD

If Little League team managers requested a quota of hats and jerseys Leuthner would skim personal profit by claiming to buy more than desired as added inventory PERIOD Sometimes he claimed to purchase equipment that the local manufacturer never sold PERIOD Management at Xtreme Custom Apparel crafted exorbitant invoices that Leuthner paid before personally retrieving the extra cash from the distributor PERIOD

For such a small program  carried significant weight PERIOD Granted my team still received sufficient funding for decent apparel and field renovations PERIOD But competition with larger and more affluent programs around the Twin Cities left us on the back burner PERIOD

My parents never suspected foul play PERIOD No one did PERIOD For us the sheer size of the program justified the painfully slow growth of the program PERIOD Simple projects like repairing a pane of the outfield fence stretched into oblivion and our participation outside of league play faded PERIOD By the time playoffs rolled around we lost PERIOD We lost big PERIOD

With the programs financial growth and stability polluted the PR that swirled around the Hamel Athletic Club left the program in shambles PERIOD Despite countless attempts to propagate program expansion it remains a mediocre punching bag for competitive metro teams PERIOD

I sympathize with the organizations treasurer PERIOD The embezzlement fiasco capitalized on her lack of resources and insight when she needed it most PERIOD Locals chastised her for alleged involvement perhaps permanently tainting her reputation PERIOD

But amidst all of the current chaos I hesitate to sympathize with MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred PERIOD A prestigious arsenal of technologies and ingenious sleuths rest in his fingertips yet he fails to calm the shockwaves of dishonesty before they explode into the public sphere  or more significantly before a disingenuous championship is won PERIOD Retribution in the body of sports takes effect after the victory lap after the ceremonies after this page of our history book turns PERIOD Professional leagues have the power to regulate their many abuses of technology even before they occur PERIOD Put simply all they need to do is use it PERIOD

After all who knows what the Eddie Leuthners of our time might steal next
