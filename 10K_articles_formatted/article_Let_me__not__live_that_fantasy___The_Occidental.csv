Loyalty is the most undervalued trait in sports PERIOD Last week this column investigated loyalty within the National Football League NFL in terms of free agency and cutting players PERIOD

But it is not just the NFL that has a problem with loyalty PERIOD All sports follow the same pattern of cutting players for money usually blaming it on other reasons like age or their chances at victory as depicted last week with the examples of Champ Bailey and DeMarcus Ware PERIOD

Fans too have begun to decrease their loyalties PERIOD Granted there are extreme fans that have not lost an ounce of loyalty in generations but fans on the whole have begun to lose the mindset of dedication to one team PERIOD There should not even be the concept of a bandwagon. loyalty means being there for the team through everything it is like marrying a team PERIOD

I am a Cubs fan I have loved the Cubs my whole life PERIOD My sister works for the Red Sox and only when the Cubs shockingly were out of the running for a ring last season did I consider cheering for her team PERIOD Even then it felt wrong dirty somehow PERIOD

With drafts going on for Major League Baseball MLB fantasy leagues it is clear to me that loyalty among fans is declining PERIOD As a fan of any one team how can a person cheer for other players

It is one thing to objectively look at a player and say great catch or great game even great player. but to want that person to do well in a game even against the team for which a person cheers is basically blasphemy PERIOD

If I created a MLB fantasy team I could not put a player from another organization on my roster PERIOD I refuse to cheer for players from other teams PERIOD That does not mean I do not respect players from other teams but I will not go so far as to root for them PERIOD

Fantasy sports diminishes if not ruins true fanmanship PERIOD Fantasy sports is the equivalent of jumping on a bandwagon even if only the bandwagon of a single player PERIOD

Those with fantasy teams cheer for players on rival teams yet do not want the rival team to do well PERIOD It just does not work that way PERIOD The whole team works as one so to cheer for a player is like cheering for the rival team PERIOD

But people do not seem to think in terms of dedication to a single team anymore PERIOD Sports are something to be enjoyed calmly and for pleasure so few people actually pour all their heart and soul into a team PERIOD Instead their loyalty is won by a victorious team or a team with better colors PERIOD

Sports lose meaning and valor when people give away their loyalties when they do not throw themselves into the sport wholeheartedly PERIOD If someone can watch a game without yelling once or getting emotionally involved then that person is not a true fan PERIOD
