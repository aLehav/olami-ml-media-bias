In  the Capital Area Transit System lost its contract and partnership with the University but this year CATS has the chance to reestablish its service in the campus area PERIOD

CATS CEO Bob Mirabito said he thinks CATS can serve University students better than First Transit the transit line that provides Tiger Trails because its buses can combine campus routes and other city routes into one system PERIOD

You have to understand LSU can only provide service that is targeted for areas around campus Mirabito said PERIOD We are the public transit provider for East Baton Rouge Parish so what students would get from CATS  in addition to campus services  would be services around different areas of Baton Rouge. however CATS doesnt offer some of the amenities provided by First Transit PERIOD

First Transit offers four nighttime routes that students rely heavily on while CATS buses begin their routes at  a.m PERIOD and end at  p.m PERIOD daily but Mirabito said those hours can change PERIOD

If a nighttime service is included in the contract that LSU offers CATS then obviously wed do it Mirabito said PERIOD We listen to our customers. mirabito said they would look into demands for nighttime services in other parts of the city like downtown or the Corporate Boulevard area PERIOD

CATS has a GPS bus tracking app similar to First Transits but there are some differences Mirabito said PERIOD

The First Transit app called TransLoc has a realtime tracking map where riders can see individual buses moving along their routes as well as a minutebyminute countdown for bus stop arrivals

CATS uses CATS Trax an app provided by a company called RouteShout PERIOD While the CATS app offers minutebyminute countdowns it does not provide a live map PERIOD

Mirabito said CATS could be more convenient for students especially those who use public transit to get to other parts of the city PERIOD

Right now you have to have two apps Mirabito said PERIOD For example if you want to take an LSU bus to get to an LSU bus stop that is also served by CATS you first have to see when the LSU bus is coming PERIOD Then when you get off the LSU bus you have to see when the CATS bus is coming PERIOD If CATS has all the service its all integrated into one application and one system PERIOD Its a lot easier for students to get around all of East Baton Rouge Parish not just campus. the University charges all students a flat fee of about  per semester to pay for the First Transit system PERIOD Mirabito said he thinks the case would be the same if CATS were awarded the new contract PERIOD

My expectation would be that the LSU ID would be your passport onto CATS buses and youd be able to get free transportation Mirabito said PERIOD

Mirabito became CEO June  four years after CATS lost its partnership with the University but he said he thinks the company lost a significant amount of revenue and a new contract would have a large impact on their earnings PERIOD

CATS is also looking into alternatively fueled buses Mirabito said PERIOD

They are considering switching to electric or hydroelectric buses and Mirabito said he thinks serving the University could help PERIOD

Being able to partner with LSU to provide bus service to the students and the campus could be a catalyst in us switching to alternative fuel buses Mirabito said PERIOD

University director of finance and administration Jeffrey Campbell said CATS lost its contract with the University in  because of student and faculty complaints PERIOD

Customer service just didnt seem to be a priority for CATS back then Campbell said PERIOD We had multiple complaints about professionalism and reliability of service PERIOD CATS management was not addressing those issues. campbell said students have been fairly pleased with the First Transit system but theres always going to be complaints PERIOD

The biggest issues students and faculty have with First Transit system are the bus schedules and the lack of buses Campbell said PERIOD The University currently has a fleet of  buses but only  or  run at a time in case backup is needed PERIOD

In the last six years since the First Transit contract weve increased in student population PERIOD But in the contract with First Transit we called for a certain number of buses Campbell said PERIOD We can pull one bus from one route and put it on another but then youd get some backlash. the new proposed contract will be a 10year agreement and is asking for new buses Campbell said PERIOD

Proposals will be accepted from any interested transit system and will be graded on a point system PERIOD Campbell said PERIOD

Im not saying CATS will get it and Im not saying CATS wont get it Campbell said PERIOD Its based on the service and technology they can provide and anything to prevent additional cost PERIOD Well always do whats in the best interest of the University and the students. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
