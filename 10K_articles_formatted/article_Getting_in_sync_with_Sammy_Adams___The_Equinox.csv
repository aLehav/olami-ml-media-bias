In  Whitney Houston kept a starspangled secret PERIOD She performed her own rendition of the national anthem at that years Super Bowl PERIOD Houston not only changed the version of the anthem to a  meter she also lipsynched the performance according to ABC News PERIOD

Since then artists such as Ashlee Simpson Britney Spears and Milli Vanilli have all given lipsynched performances PERIOD And now Sammy Adams has allegedly jumped on the lipsynching bandwagon PERIOD

On Nov PERIOD  Sammy Adams performed in the Mabel Brown Room during Keene State Colleges Fall Concert PERIOD But this isnt Adams first time performing at KSC he performed during the  Spring Weekend concert PERIOD However his performance this year is causing controversy among the student body PERIOD

According to Jennifer Ferrell director of student involvement the concert came to a total of 37000a  performance fee  in production costs an approximate  in Keene Police Department and Campus Safety fees  for agency fees and  for requests PERIOD

However ticket sales brought in an income of approximately  bringing the actual cost of the fall concert to  according to Ferrell PERIOD She said that the Social Activities Council S.A.C. planned to spend somewhere around  on this years Fall Concert PERIOD But some students think that this concert performance was not worth the expensive price tag PERIOD

Michael Graham who helped with the tech setup of the concert said Were paying a guy to come here lip sync and smoke marijuana I think we may want to think about the message we are saying. as Graham was striking one set which is when all of the lights and speakers are taken down and the cables are unplugged during the middle of Adams set he said he was able to smell marijuana smoke in the green room in the Young Student Center PERIOD

I go through the green room so I can sneak back onstage PERIOD Im walking down just from the stretch from the stairs to the curtains and I hit the curtains and go through them PERIOD And Im just hit with the thickest smell of marijuana smoke Graham said PERIOD

Graham is just one of the many students who voiced their concern that Sammy Adams was lipsynching during his performance.Visually you could tell he was lipsynching PERIOD There were a lot of times where he was supposedly singing but he wasnt singing PERIOD Also vocally every now and then when he would talk to the audience you would hear his voice and it would be different singing and that isnt something that should happen Graham said PERIOD

Junior Bri Knapp who attended the Sammy Adams concert said It reflects back on him PERIOD Is he Adams not talented enough to show us his real voice

Graham explained that Adams might have allegedly been able to lipsync during the Fall Concert performance by using something called a halftrack PERIOD

If anything it was a halftrack with spaces so he could tailor the verses to the school that he is in and still be able to pull off not singing so his lyrical work would go from all of the songs he said PERIOD

These halftracks are incomplete vocal tracks that allow the artist to tailor their music according to the venue they are performing at Graham explained PERIOD Graham said that these tailored songs are instant crowdpleasers PERIOD Artists have songs like that in their back pocket in order to provoke a reaction out of the audience he said PERIOD

And a reaction is what Adams roused out of the crowd PERIOD Junior Shea Daly said You could hear when he would go in and out of a song PERIOD There was a change in sound Daly said PERIOD

Graham said he believes that this change in sound is a result of the halftracks that were used during the performance PERIOD Setting up strike was pretty simplealmost too simple. graham explained that the equipment that Sammy Adams had during the performance consisted of two turntables that were connected to a mixer that mixer was then connected to a mixer and two digital input boxers which are preamplifiers PERIOD

Graham explained that these halftracks could be played using equipment called Serato Scratch Live PERIOD Its a really famous DJ software that has all your tracks where you can set up cues he said PERIOD

This equipment makes it easy to mix more than one track simultaneously and feature certain controls such as cues and loops which allow you to repeat certain sections and create new intros and outros in mixes according to Seratos website PERIOD

This program allows you to do a lot more as far as deejaying goes Graham said PERIOD Freshman Kayla Daurizio said Thered be parts where the music was still playing and he would yell to the audience PERIOD However Graham argues that the answer to whether or not Adams was lipsynching during his performance is dependent upon who you ask PERIOD

If people like Sammy Adams I dont know if theyre going to be as flat out willing to admit that he was lipsynching he said PERIOD

Junior Jenn Zinka said that you either pay for a great vocal performance or a great presence onstage and she said she believes that Adams created an energetic stage persona PERIOD But now pop culture has proven that more and more artists are lipsynching during performances PERIOD Even the greats such as Whitney Houston Britney Spears and Kanye West have all been accused of allegedly lipsynching during their performances PERIOD

Yet some question whether or not a lipsynching artist is worth  PERIOD Daly said it was a waste of her money PERIOD
