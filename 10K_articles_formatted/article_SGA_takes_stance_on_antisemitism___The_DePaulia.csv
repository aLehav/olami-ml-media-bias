Chava NovogrodskyGodt social chair of DePaul Hillel and junior talks about her appreciation for Student Government Association SGA including Jewish students in the conversation when creating their statement addressing recent antisemitism on campus PERIOD

Student Government Association SGA held their first public discussion acknowledging the recent outbreaks of antisemitism and antiJewish incidents on campus on Thursday Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

SGA received an anonymous letter from a DePaul senior roughly a week and a half prior which prompted a closeddoor discussion by the general body during their meeting on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD A statement was then drafted by SGA and later amended in an open session on Nov PERIOD  with input from members of DePauls Jewish community PERIOD

We wanted to destigmatize the notion that we were doing something private DePaul senior and SGA president Kevin Holechko said PERIOD Even though the process did take significantly longer than it might have in a closeddoor discussion I firmly believe we did the right thing PERIOD We took the first steps in addressing this problem as a community. the statement was originally drafted by junior Gabriel Goldberg Senator for Mission and Ministry and then edited by various members of SGA PERIOD The second draft was done by SGA senators Avery Schoenhals senator for the college of communication and sophomore and Zoe Bragado senator for commuter students and junior PERIOD One of Goldbergs main concerns was addressing the Vincentian mission and religious values in the response PERIOD Goldberg believes his perspectives as both an SGA senator and a Jewish student helped him bridge the gap between both groups PERIOD

This is a culture and a religion that speaks out in a very Vincentian perspective by asking what must we do for our community Goldberg said PERIOD We as DePaul students are recognized as individuals who give and support a community of diversity PERIOD Because of this it is our duty and privilege to be able to get this interfaith and intercultural experience. junior Chava NovogrodskyGodt social chair of DePaul Hillel a Jewish student organization on campus believes the statement is a promising first step toward change but wants to see action behind it PERIOD She said she acknowledges SGA wanting to work with the Jewish community and hopes the relationship that comes from their collaboration will inspire longer conversations about the issue PERIOD

Oftentimes especially college here I feel Judaism has been conflated to politics war and conflict but it is a religion its an ethnicity its an ethnoreligion PERIOD I wish people had a better understanding of what it was NovogrodskyGodt said PERIOD Its important to listen to minority voices and understand who youre sharing a campus with even if its a small population. of the Jewish student leaders present at the meeting each student echoed sentiments of hope that addressing the antisemitism and antiJewish rhetoric on campus will lead to increased education about Judaism at DePaul PERIOD They encourage all students regardless of faith or background to attend Jewish cultural events as a way to increase participation for their organizations and create more visibility for Jewish students PERIOD

My best way to fight antisemitism is to be more involved in the Jewish community to go see my Jewish friends to learn about something Jewish and I think that is something anybody can do said senior Emily Fridland president of Chabad a Jewish student organization on campus PERIOD

In their statement SGA added links to resources for students experiencing antisemitism and antiJewish rhetoric on campus PERIOD These resources include DePaul Hillel DePaul Chabad and Alpha Epsilon Pi AEPi PERIOD Senior Justin Fisher president of AEPi vice president of Chabad said he believes the purpose of these organizations is to create a safe space and build a community for Jewish students PERIOD He said this is mainly done through support which is especially important during the hard times Jewish students currently face PERIOD

I know personally this does feel like my home away from home even though Im not far and because Ive joined Chabad and joined Jewish life it truly has been so incredible said junior Danie Shvartsman treasurer of Chabad PERIOD Having this support and this community I really never feel alone. a religious pluralism training is currently being developed by the Office of Mission and Ministry to educate the community about issues regarding religious oppression PERIOD The training will include acknowledgements about antisemitism along with Islamophobia and Catholicisms impact on marginalized religions PERIOD

Its an interesting thing because we go to a Catholic university so how much can we expect support for the other faiths Fridland said PERIOD But its not necessarily support that were looking for its respect PERIOD This year there has been an effort to have interfaith events and to have religions come together to learn about each other PERIOD Just having student government and administration present at those I feel shows us the respect that were looking for. while all agree that what they have seen thus far from SGA and administration is a good indication of change Fisher said it may come too late since these issues have been happening on campus for years PERIOD He said conversations with administration did not stick in the past but the recent media coverage of antisemitism and the anonymous letter that was sent to SGA has finally spurred DePaul into action PERIOD

Im grateful this is happening but in the past it was never as much as were seeing now Fisher said PERIOD The biggest part with this new administration is there are people pushing to make sure every student group not just the Jewish community but all communities are heard and cared about. simply by inviting Jewish students to the meeting and listening to their input on the statement the Jewish student leaders are hopeful for the positive outcomes they believe will follow SGAs action PERIOD While there is still more to be done NovogrodskyGodt hopes it is a movement toward partnership and change PERIOD

It often feels like people are talking about us but not with us or to us NovogrodskyGodt said PERIOD I do think this is a huge step for SGA to put out a statement about being Jewish on campus and I feel that were all ready to work to make sure something does come out of it PERIOD It feels great to have some recognition. campus News
