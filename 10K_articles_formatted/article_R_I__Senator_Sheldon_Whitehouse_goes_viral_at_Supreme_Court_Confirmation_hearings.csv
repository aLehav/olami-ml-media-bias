Last week the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett began in the United States Senate illustrating the stark divide amongst Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill PERIOD

Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse who serves on the Judiciary Committee went viral due to a  minute presentation in which he used poster board displays to document how dark money influences United States politics PERIOD Multiple videos of Sen PERIOD Whitehouses presentations were posted by PBS MSNBC and Now This Politics with views totalling over  million all together PERIOD

Sen PERIOD Whitehouse asserted that the driving force behind Judge Barretts nomination was dark money being received by Republicans influencing them to nominate justices that would rule in the favor of wealthy donors PERIOD He also claimed that the  decision of Citizens United v PERIOD FEC in which the Supreme Court ruled that the government was not allowed to limit contributions made to political action committees or other forms of political communication by corporations or special interest groups as long as the donations were not made directly to candidates PERIOD

Referring to an investigation by The Washington Post Sen PERIOD Whitehouse said the Republican party had been partaking in a  million dark money operation which had the sole goal of packing the courts with justices who will reverse the long line of activist decisions including Roe Obergefell and the Obamacare cases Sen PERIOD Whitehouse said citing directly from the Republican Party PERIOD That is their stated objective and plan why not take them at their word

Sen PERIOD Whitehouse went on to further point to at least  cases in which Trump administration justices had voted in line with the Republican partys stated beliefs PERIOD He said But it is not what is ahead of us PERIOD What is behind us is now  cases under Chief Justice Roberts that have these characteristics they were decided    by a bare majority the    majority was partisan in a sense that not one Democratic appointee joined the five...and the last characteristic is that there us an identifiable Republican public interest and in every single case that donor interest one. in an OpEd released on NBC news Sen PERIOD Whitehouse stated It almost doesnt matter who President Donald Trump picked to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg it never really did PERIOD What really matters is who  and whose money  lurks behind the process of shaping the Supreme Court and whats at stake for all of us from the voting public to the Republican senators rubberstamping it. confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett have concluded PERIOD The Senate is set to vote on her confirmation on October  PERIOD
