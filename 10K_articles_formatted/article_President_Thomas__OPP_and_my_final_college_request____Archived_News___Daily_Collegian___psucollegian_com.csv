My Opinion

Im not long for this place PERIOD

As you read this  provided you havent already skipped to The Far Side  my time at Penn State is drawing to a close PERIOD Its been a good four years and Ive been lucky enough to accomplish much of what my parents must have had in mind when they began setting Dads paychecks aside for my college savings PERIOD

Ive eaten something called  in the dining hall PERIOD Ive been caught smuggling marshmallows into a football game  the security guard asked me in what had to be the greatest setup line in recorded history only to watch my friend Jim get by the guards and sink a beautiful arcing shot into a cheerleaders megaphone during the pregame warmups PERIOD

Again and again I havent known the goddamn words PERIOD

Ive passed out in front of several hundred people in the HUB Ballroom while fully costumed as Slash the guitarist from Guns N Roses PERIOD Ive stood on the Ballroom stage and thrown my underwear not the pair I was wearing into a crowd of people PERIOD Ive had my couch confiscated by the police PERIOD Its a long story. all told I think my parents would be proud of what their hardearned savings have led to in Happy Valley PERIOD But theres something crucial I havent done yet and its starting to haunt me as my Penn State days wind down PERIOD

I want to go cruising with Joab Thomas in an Office of Physical Plant vehicle PERIOD

Im sure youve seen these awesome threewheelers sputtering around campus PERIOD Small white and topheavy they look like high school auto shop disasters PERIOD  With less horsepower than most vacuum cleaners theyre routinely passed going uphill by injured people on crutches PERIOD These are truly pathetic vehicles and I cant think of a more apt expression of who I am than to drive one before I leave Happy Valley PERIOD

Thats where President Thomas comes in PERIOD I cant seem to get a hold of an OPP mobile  everybody I ask kind of looks at me funny  but the University president could probably land as many of them as he wanted simply by snapping his fingers PERIOD And an afternoon of cruising would offer a muchneeded break from his hectic daily schedule of signing massive corporate deals and not canceling classes for snow PERIOD Imagine the things Joab and I could do

 Play  An extracurricular activity no doubt popular with hoodlums in your high school this involves driving through a neighborhood and whacking at its mailboxes with a baseball bat PERIOD Its great fun to hear it from some of my high school friends one of whom is now in jail PERIOD

An OPP vehicle is perfectly sized for such an endeavor one person me drives and the other President Thomas leans out the passenger window and commits acts of vandalism PERIOD Granted our getaway would be slow but nobody would bother to report us since the president is such a widely respected campus figure PERIOD

Although there is a lack of mailboxes around campus to attack we could drive a nail through the bat and take out the colored balloons that student groups are always setting up in front of Willard Building to commemorate various events such as National Colored Balloon Awareness Month PERIOD We could also play with actual mailboxes but that would involve driving into a dorm commons and decimating an entire wall PERIOD While this would be extremely cool wed probably get in trouble for it. pretend to run over Joe Paterno  PERIOD Wed do this by purchasing a cardboard cutout of JoePa at one of the local bookstores and setting it up on the sidewalk when nobody was around PERIOD Then when some pedestrians walked by wed crash into the cutout with our OPP mobile and try to fool them PERIOD

 wed wail tearing at our hair and sobbing convulsively PERIOD  Once a crowd had gathered wed let everybody know that it was just a prank share a goodnatured laugh and continue down the sidewalk to our next site PERIOD

And those are just two of the wacky stunts Joab and I could pull off in our OPP sex machine PERIOD We could drive the wrong way on College Avenue and play chicken with cars PERIOD We could play Steppenwolf really loud and cruise the McDonalds parking lot for babes PERIOD We could chase the Willard Preacher around PERIOD We could even drive to Shields Building and back provided we carried a few extra tanks of gas PERIOD

So President Thomas if youre still reading this  please give some thought to my offer PERIOD Cruising in an OPP vehicle with you would be the highlight of my entire life possibly excepting the underwearthrowing episode PERIOD Thanks for your time and I hope to hear from you soon PERIOD
