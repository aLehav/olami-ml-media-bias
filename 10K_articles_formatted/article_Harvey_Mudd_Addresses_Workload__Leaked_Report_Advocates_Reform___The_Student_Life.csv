TSL recently obtained a leaked report conducted at the request of Harvey Mudd Colleges Teaching and Learning Committee in Oct PERIOD  PERIOD In the report students and facultyparticipated in private focus groups evaluating the impact of HMCs workload and honor code PERIOD

The findings of the researchers Charlie Blaich and Kathy Wise from the Center for Inquiry of Liberal Arts were emailed to committee members in Feb PERIOD  and the report which was not intended for public release can be found in full below



The researchers who help liberal arts colleges selfassess found that HMC students were talented and hardworking but many suffered from feelings of inferiority and insecurity due to an onslaught of workthat superseded extracurricular activities nonSTEM academic interests and even essential activities like eating sleeping laundry and showering PERIOD

In their report Blaich and Wise provided their suggestions to the TLC after speaking with  students and  faculty members all anonymous PERIOD

Our recommendations are simple the researchers wrote PERIOD First be more generous in addition to being tough and second create time for students to develop the qualities that the institution values including the values behind the Honor Code. on March  Mudds Faculty Executive Committee emailed an action document addressing the reports findings to Mudd students and faculty.Though faculty were previouslyemailed the full report only a summaryappeared in the action documentavailable to the student body PERIOD

The action plan notes that the reports concerns are important issues that call for a concerted and sustained effort from students faculty and staff at all levels of seniority. the document outlines prior and ongoing activities by HMC to address student workload including a review of HMCs Common Core curriculum a faculty job satisfaction survey a faculty and student time expenditure study the Peer Academic Liaisons program and the work of the health and wellness staff PERIOD

Students seeking immediate change will have to be patient the FEC emphasized that substantialadjustments take time PERIOD

Efforts to review and revise aspects of the Core curriculum may not seem to be producing change fast enough for many of our current students to feel their effects the committee wrote PERIOD

However we firmly believe that the curriculum ought not to change quickly nor without systematic careful study and input from our colleges many stakeholders students faculty alumni staff and trustees. associated Students of Harvey Mudd College President Shailee Samar HM  agreed that HMCs Core curriculum needs improvement PERIOD

We need to adapt our perspective to ensure that our students thrive and not only survive Samar wrote in an email to TSL PERIOD The action items listed should just be the first few steps and I hope that we move quickly take impactful action and reevaluate the big picture. aSHMCs FirstYear Class President Julia Wang HM  thought the action documents description of HMC workloaddid a pretty good job of capturing the student life and academics. students dont have the opportunity really to make time to actually enjoy all the subjects theyre taking Wang said PERIOD Worklife balance is such a struggle that it becomes a joke PERIOD I dont think it should be treated like that. wang expressed disappointment that the college did not release the full report to students PERIOD

It seems kinda hurtful that they know this is going on and that they in a sense didnt want us to know she said PERIOD

Blaich and Wise found that faculty were split on whether to be accommodating to students who felt burdened by the workload PERIOD

Some faculty were sympathetic worked to help students deal with the challenges and thought that Harvey Mudd needs to change to give students a little breathing room they wrote in the report PERIOD These faculty checked in on students and asked how they were doing were more flexible about deadlines shared how they struggled with their workload and encouraged students to ask questions. others however thought that Harvey Mudd students had over time become less capable of and less interested in meeting the challenge of Mudds difficult curriculum PERIOD While it is not unusual for us to hear faculty lament the decline in the quality of students what was unusual in our experience was that many students had heard and felt this sentiment from some of their faculty. laura Palucki Blake Mudds director of institutional research and effectiveness and a member of the TLC urged TSL not to release the full report PERIOD

Our strong preference would be to not have students and faculty members responses quoted she wrote in an email to TSL PERIOD In projects like this participants are encouraged to speak candidly with the understanding their comments are confidential. this years chair of the TLC Jae Hur joined the committee in the  school year and wrote in an email to TSL that releasing comments made in confidence will do real damage to our ability to gather information in the future to improve our campus. tSL decided to release the report in the interest of transparency and to allow students to examine the information gathered by the researchers and provided by fellow students and faculty members for themselves PERIOD

Hur recalled that prior to the reports release there was already a proactive selfmotivated effort by faculty here to look at  how to help our students really understand their sense of accomplishment and abilities. he said the report is an important part of what we were doing but its not certainly meant to be the entire thing. when Hur assigns homework to his classes he wants his students to take a step back and say like Wow I did that PERIOD Thats amazing PERIOD Thats a lot of work and a lot of learning that I accomplished. but faculty members quoted in Blaichs and Wises report saidthat some HMC professors assign homework for a different reason PERIOD

To get students time you need to give them a problem set something tangible to work on so they spend time on it one anonymous faculty member said in the report PERIOD Its an arms race. blaich and Wise seemed to conclude that this approach was not productive PERIOD

At some point when students are stretched far enough all this results in is departments stealing students time from one another in a zerosum game they wrote PERIOD Many of the students with whom we spoke appeared to be at this point. faculty believed the resulting workload incentivized students to cheat and otherwise violate HMCs honor code PERIOD

The pressures students feel from the workload are putting pressures on the Honor Code one faculty member said in the report PERIOD HMC has an oppressive curriculum. the researchers noted that some faculty members thought students needed to learn the whys of the code  the report suggests students and faculty members have different perceptions of what the code entails PERIOD

Aside from privacy and confidentiality concerns Hur says theres another reason not to release what he calls the raw version of the report PERIOD

Ive come to the conclusion that its not helpful he said PERIOD The issues it brings up are clearly very helpful but  it needs a better delivery if its not going to just make people reactive and actually approach an issue thats important for everyone involved. professor Lelia Hawkins who was the TLC chair when Blaich and Wise visited HMC agreesthat the negative tone could be offputting. i think that if you are external to Mudd its easy to be surprised by the workload here whereas if youre a faculty or student here you understand its more normal she said PERIOD

Hawkins emphasized that the report was a starting point and wants to look beyond the tone and sort of pick the pieces out that are useful to us  and thats why the report was written for a committee to digest. she said no one at Mudd wants college to be easier but agrees the curriculum can be unmanageable at times PERIOD

Hawkins does not know what the solution is and wants a quantitative review to provide more information PERIOD

If were going to say that workload is a problem we need to know exactly what parts and why Hawkins said PERIOD

To that end HMC hired educational effectiveness consultants who spoke to more than  members of the college community on March  as part of a core curriculum review according to the FEC PERIOD Hawkins said the review was planned before the workload reports release but it is also in some ways a response to the issues that were raised. do we drop units Do we drop courses Do we change courses These are all on the table until people take them off the table she said PERIOD We have a coupleofyears process ahead of us. samuel Breslow contributed reporting PERIOD
