The Marvel Cinematic Universe PERIOD Staff Illustration by Susan Behrends Valenzuela

Spoiler warning This article may include spoilers for Marvel movies and series PERIOD

The multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little. this line said by Marvels Doctor Strange was used heavily in marketing material for the  hit SpiderMan No Way Home. in my opinion it should be the tagline for every noncomics property with the Marvel logo attached particularly ahead of the release of the next Marvel movie Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. let me explain PERIOD

Throughout its comics movies and shows Marvel employs the concept of a multiverse PERIOD This is the idea of there being infinite universes with infinite possibilities PERIOD

This means that theres a universe where Im SpiderMan PERIOD Theres also a universe where Im writing this very article but about DC Comics instead of Marvel PERIOD The idea of a multiverse allows Marvel to use time travel alternate versions of characters and multiversal events PERIOD It also is a convenient explanation for the countless legal disputes between Marvel and the studios that own the rights to its characters PERIOD

In the 1990s Marvel struggled financially as the popularity of comics dwindled PERIOD Marvel sold the film rights of many wellliked characters to various Hollywood studios presumably to both make money and increase the characters popularity PERIOD

With the newly acquired rights the studios began releasing movies PERIOD These included twentieth Century Foxs XMen in  and Sony Pictures SpiderMan starring Tobey Maguire in  PERIOD In  Marvel changed its name to Marvel Entertainment to reflect its new desire to turn properties it still owned into films PERIOD

Marvel still owned the film rights to the Avengers PERIOD When exploring what films they could begin producing independently executives turned to two of the teams founding members Iron Man and the Hulk PERIOD

Universal Pictures had already produced a Hulk movie in  PERIOD When no sequel was able to be produced however Universal agreed to return the film rights to Marvel in  PERIOD Meanwhile Marvel was working on another project  in May of  Iron Man was released to overwhelming success PERIOD

Directed by Jon Favreau and starring Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man began the Marvel Cinematic Universe PERIOD It not only was the first movie of an incredibly successful franchise but it also set the tone for future MCU projects PERIOD Characters would stay grounded in reality despite absurd surroundings relationships would drive stories without being the focus and quips would keep stories fun PERIOD The film also included a postcredits scene to tease viewers about future projects PERIOD Iron Man was just the beginning PERIOD

After the  releases of Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk the Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment for . billion PERIOD Under Disney the MCU would grow PERIOD Eventually The Avengers premiered in  combining aspects from all previous MCU movies into a comic nerds dream PERIOD

Disneys acquisition of Marvel created a fine line between the MCU and nonDisney Marvel properties PERIOD In short any Marvel movie released prior to Iron Man is not a part of the MCU along with almost any future nonDisney Marvel movie PERIOD This includes Sonys  SpiderMan reboot The Amazing SpiderMan starring Andrew Garfield and Foxs  Fantastic Four. for a long time these movies were disconnected from the MCU PERIOD That would eventually change PERIOD Surprisingly this wouldnt come with Disneys  acquisition of Fox but rather with SpiderMan PERIOD

In  Marvel released Captain America Civil War and brought SpiderMan into the MCU PERIOD This SpiderMan wasnt played by Maguire or Garfield but instead by Tom Holland PERIOD The third cinematic representation of the character was the result of a complex agreement between Marvel and Sony PERIOD SpiderMan could appear in the MCU  even in his own movie 2017s SpiderMan Homecoming  as long as Sony was able to release the Marvelproduced SpiderMan movies PERIOD

In  No Way Home premiered changing the relationship between SpiderMan and the MCU franchise PERIOD Maguire Garfield and villains from their prior films appeared in the  movie PERIOD However their franchises are still not canonical to the MCU PERIOD Rather they are canonical to the Marvel multiverse PERIOD Maguire and Garfield are variants of SpiderMan from other universes  universes they eventually return to PERIOD Their movies do not take place in the MCU but instead in alternate universes PERIOD

The concept of variants was first introduced into the MCU in the Disney television series Loki  which brings us to Marvels confusing liveaction television shows PERIOD

Shows from before Disneys acquisition of Marvel are not canon to the MCU PERIOD When 2013s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D premiered many interpreted it as canon along with standalone shows like Agent Carter and shows connected to the Netflix series The Defenders like Daredevil. in  however President of Marvel Studios Kevin Feige declared all Marvel TV shows as not part of MCU canon PERIOD

Marvels first new show WandaVision was soon premiering on Disney and it would be more convenient to have only Disney releases be canon PERIOD According to rumors executive disputes also may have contributed to the decision PERIOD

WandaVision released in  and became an instant favorite PERIOD The story of a woman  albeit one with universebending powers  coping with grief through the familiar medium of classic sitcoms resonated with audiences PERIOD This was followed up with The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki the latter of which introduced the concept of the multiverse to the MCU PERIOD This introduction of the multiverse allowed for shows like What If  the only animated piece of MCU canon  and movies like No Way Home and Multiverse of Madness. in December  change would again come to Marvels shows PERIOD No Way Home and the Disney show Hawkeye both included characters from Daredevil. unlike Maguire and Garfields SpiderMan variants Charlie Coxs Daredevil and Vincent DOnofrios Kingpin are the same ones that were seen in the Netflix series PERIOD

A couple months later the Marvel shows on Netflix were moved to Disney PERIOD With these developments the Netflix shows were once again canon to the MCU PERIOD While this extended to Agent Carter AOS is still believed by many to not be canon though it could take place in a different parallel universe PERIOD

With Disney now owning the rights for characters previously owned by Fox MCU movies starring the Fantastic Four or the XMen are possible PERIOD A Fantastic Four movie is in the works but information about it is sparse PERIOD

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness will premiere on May  and is rumored to introduce mutants  and therefore XMen  to the MCU PERIOD Nothing has been confirmed though and well just have to watch the movie to find out PERIOD
