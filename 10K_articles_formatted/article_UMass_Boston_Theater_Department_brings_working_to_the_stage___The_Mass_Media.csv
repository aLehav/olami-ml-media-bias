Students performing during the dress rehearsal of UMass Bostons production of the musical Working PERIOD

Katrina Sanville EditorinChiefNovember  

After over two years musical theater finally returns to the Performing Arts Department at UMass Boston PERIOD Following the theater shutdowns impacted by COVID19 UMass Bostons process to return to a fullscale yearly production schedule had been slow PERIOD The department held inperson performances throughout the  school year however they were still held back by COVID19 restrictions and precautions PERIOD The department returned to its full potential in the  year and made a splash while doing so. working A Musicalopened to the UMass Boston community and friends on Nov PERIOD  and ran from Nov PERIOD  to Nov PERIOD  PERIOD Based on a  musical with a similar premise this revamped  musical follows a group of ordinary people doing ordinary jobsa teacher a stay at home mother a UPS driver a truck driver and a sex worker just to name a fewand the highs and lows these ordinary people face PERIOD As director for Working Carrie Ann Quinn states in the musicals program
This musical explores the inner struggles and dreams of the worker and the human being PERIOD We are all connected and dependent upon each other in this American working societywhether we want to admit it or not PERIOD I argue that working is not just a survival tool but also an urge or a hunger that we need to feed with both our body and soul. the musical features a cast of six charactersthree men and three womenwho portray a variety of roles and jobs through monologues and songs PERIOD These songs were written by a variety of famous musicians such as Stephen Schwartz LinManuel Miranda Micki Grant and James Taylor which provided a variety of different tones to the musical. workingalso features a large open set consisting of a scaffolding building that could be customized to whatever the scene called for and portrayed a variety of different needs PERIOD Whether it was an office building or just a way to create levels and dynamics amongst the cast the scaffolding set created a fun open way to liven up any given scene PERIOD Likewise were the easytomove sets like the rolling staircase cafe table or schoolroom which came in and out of scenes to perpetuate a specific characters scene. overall Workingwas such a delight to see and such a warm way to kick off the return to musical theater PERIOD The cast was truly incredible and talented and the plot was so enjoyable and relatable for the college audience PERIOD While many college students may not have worked all of the jobs featured in the musical they could resonate with the feeling of the freedom from having a first job and the exhaustion from service jobs and everything that goes with them. one standout scene from the musical was the elementary school teachers song in which she comments on the change in her time of teaching and how children now have lost many of the manners they had before PERIOD Though the musical was revised in  many of the same themes hold up nearly ten years later in the aftermath of COVID19 PERIOD Many of the themes feel all the more important and prevalent especially the teacher as the teacher has returned to students who spent many of their formative years inside and largely unsocialized. another stellar scene was the song featuring the waitress at the top of Act Two where she describes needing to keep her schedule and routine entertaining in order to keep from going insane PERIOD For those who have worked in food service there is a certain level of understanding regarding this especially in the way the waitress performs for each table and puts on little shows for herself to keep her job entertaining. the musical really allowed audience members to get in touch with their place in society and their impact on other workers as well as those around them PERIOD Whether it was a housewife with the line what I do is out of fashion  what I do is out of date when reflecting on her struggles in her daytoday life the monotony of factory work the process involved in helping children to break the cycle of working jobs like housekeeping or the constant cycle of working from age sixteen to death Working left audience members with an optimistic outlet and a lot to think about. the show concludes with a song about giving credit to everyone who puts in the work rather than just the people who pay the money to have their name on the building and it serves as a beautiful way to wrap up the show PERIOD Working in its purest form pays tribute to everyone and every job something that is rarely done in modern times. though the Theater Department at UMass Boston has wrapped up its performances for the fall semester auditions for the spring semester will begin at the beginning of next semester PERIOD Auditions are open to all students and all majors and for more information on upcoming auditions and performances keep an eye on the Performing Arts departments website and social media PERIOD
