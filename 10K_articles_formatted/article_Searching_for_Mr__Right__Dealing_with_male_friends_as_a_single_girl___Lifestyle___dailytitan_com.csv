When I was in sixth grade my seat partners name was Sam PERIOD He wore ripped jeans pinned the names of obscure rock bands to his jacket and was infinitely cooler than me PERIOD

We used to pass each other notes when our teacher wasnt looking and I thought we were best friends PERIOD He on the other hand thought we were characters in a captivating romance novel PERIOD

That pretty much sets the scene for the majority of my oppositesex friendships throughout my life PERIOD

I recently ended a 2yearlong relationship with a man who was initially just a friend PERIOD

After we broke up it became abundantly clear to me that by dating him I gave the rest of my male friends an in. apparently by dating one male friend I had invited them all to some kind of cavemanesque battle to date me PERIOD

Let me assure you this isnt my ego talking PERIOD My group of friends are pretty close to each other PERIOD Meaning we dont really talk to anyone but each other PERIOD So when I became single I became one of the only single women that they interact with PERIOD

The point that Im trying to make is that I dont want to date my friends and when I talked to some of my girlfriends about it they

shared that sentiment PERIOD Yet the date invitations kept coming in PERIOD

I once made the mistake of accepting one but it was before that 2yearlong relationship PERIOD We went to dinner and a movie and then we went to hang out with all of our friends which was incredibly awkward since we didnt tell anybody we were going on a date PERIOD

The same guy asked if he could take me out again post 2yearrelationship breakup PERIOD I declined and said I didnt think that dating another friend was a good idea PERIOD I also told him that two years is far outside of the appropriate time frame to ask for a second date PERIOD

Men and women are completely different PERIOD We think differently we look different we have different mannerisms and apparently we

have completely different views on dating a friend PERIOD

Men and women see similar benefits to having samesex friendships but men see relationship potential with a platonic friend as a positive while women see it as a negative according to Jeremy Nicholson Ph.D PERIOD Id like to speculate that this is probably because men sometimes put a sexual agenda before logical concerns about potentially ruining a friendship with a woman PERIOD

Women on the other hand are natural worriers and constantly analyze their decisions PERIOD

I have a tendency to make mental pros and cons lists prior to making any big decision PERIOD I dont want to make it sound like my guy friends being interested in me isnt flattering but I am also not willing to jeopardize a friendship unless Im  percent sure its worth it PERIOD

In the meantime you can find me watching rom coms in sweatpants and youll find my male friends safely in the friendzone PERIOD
