8150,2021-03-31,"in the world of sports the month of March is perhaps best known for the annual NCAA Division I Basketball Tournaments commonly referred to as March Madness PERIOD After the tournaments were canceled last year due to the emergence of Covid19 excitement for this years March Madness has been incredibly high PERIOD Difficulties were to be expected given the unprecedented nature of having to plan two massive tournaments both the womens and the mens in the middle of a global pandemic PERIOD While Covid19 has presented challenges for certain games  such as when the vigorous daily testing protocol forced the Virginia Commonwealth University VCU mens team to forfeit their firstround game after receiving a number of positive tests  the spotlight has recently been focused on the NCAAs failure to provide equitable training conditions for female athletes relative to their male counterparts PERIOD

A TikTok posted by Oregon womens basketball player Sedona Prince went viral on March  a day before the tournament even began PERIOD The video showed shocking disparities between the weight rooms prepared for the mens teams in Indianapolis and the womens teams in San Antonio PERIOD While the men were provided with an enormous space complete with enough squat racks for every member of a team to have his own the women were expected to make do with just a measly set of dumbbells and a stack of yoga mats  albeit not even enough for each player PERIOD

The video sparked swift reactions from male and female athletes alike PERIOD NBA stars Kyrie Irving and Steph Curry joined forces with WNBA players Sue Bird Skyler DigginsSmith and Brianna Turner all expressing their displeasure with the NCAA and demanding change via Twitter PERIOD The outcry prompted statements from NCAA President of Basketball Dan Gavitt NCAA Vice President of Womens Basketball Lynn Holtzman and NCAA Basketball Committee Chair Nina King in an effort to quell the outrage PERIOD NCAA President Mark Emmert did not make a statement until later in the day PERIOD

Emmerts eventual response was inadequate at best and showed a supreme lack of accountability and a failure of leadership PERIOD While he stated that the inequity between the two tournaments was inexcusable Emmert insisted that he didnt know the planning details before the incident occurred and blamed a communication breakdown between the planning committees for the mens and womens tournaments due in large part to working remotely PERIOD The weight rooms were eventually upgraded by the NCAA who accepted several offers of equipment made over social media by companies but the change only came as a result of the pressure exerted by the players and coaches PERIOD

Though it has been the most visible the contrast in weight rooms is not the only disparity between the two tournaments PERIOD The women have brought numerous other inequalities to attention PERIOD While the men dined on steak filets and lobster mac and cheese the women had to make do with meager boxed meals and delayed delivery services PERIOD Gift bags were presented to all the athletes at both tournaments though the womens bags seemed to be about onethird of the size of the mens PERIOD The NCAA has stated they have addressed the poor food quality and have claimed the two different gift bags are of equal value but again these measures only came as a response to the outcry from the NCAA athletes PERIOD

There is also a stark difference in the marketing efforts taken by the NCAA to promote the two tournaments PERIOD The mens championship has grown into a highly profitable asset with a  billion per year television deal from Turner Sports just to air the event PERIOD Meanwhile strategies to expand the womens tournament do not garner nearly the same promotional effort PERIOD In fact the moniker March Madness has only been applied to the mens tournament PERIOD In all advertising material the womens tournament is simply referred to as the NCAA Womens Tournament while the phrase March Madness can be found on nearly every advertisement promoting the mens game PERIOD For example the mens games sport massive March Madness logos at center court while the womens courts simply have small NCAA Womens Basketball logos on the edges of the court PERIOD This appears to be a conscious effort by the NCAA to separate the term March Madness from womens college basketball PERIOD The internationally recognizable brand of March Madness could be a valuable asset in expanding the womens tournament which has been naturally growing in popularity due to a higher level of competition in recent years PERIOD Instead the NCAA has kept the womens tournament detached from the lucrative brand even though the trademark registration of the phrase allows for use by both tournaments PERIOD The March Madness Twitter and Instagram accounts which only feature content from the mens tournament have a combined . million followers whereas the accounts for the womens tournament which have the uninspired handle ncaawbb NCAA womens basketball have only  combined followers PERIOD

Most shocking of all have to be the disparities in the two sites Covid19 testing protocols PERIOD Each tournament is contained in a strictly isolated bubble and players receive daily Covid tests PERIOD However the mens bubble in Indianapolis administers PCR tests to all participants whereas the womens bubble in San Antonio uses antigen tests which are far less accurate than the PCR tests PERIOD The women receive a PCR test only to confirm the positive result of an antigen test PERIOD The NCAA claims that both methods of testing are equally effective models and chalked up the differences to the different testing services available in the respective locations PERIOD Even so with an issue as crucial as player safety it is shocking that the two tournaments do not apply the same caliber of safety measures to ensure the health of their participants PERIOD

Coaches players and administrators participating in the tournament have voiced their disappointment with the NCAA PERIOD In a joint statement Stanford Womens Basketball Coach Tara VanDerveer and Director of Womens Basketball Setsuko Ishiyama called the actions by the NCAA purposeful and hurtful and claimed that it is evidence of blatant sexism. they continued women athletes and coaches are done waiting not just for upgrades of a weight room but for equity in every facet of life. legendary UConn womens basketball coach Geno Auriemma who has won the most NCAA championships among both mens and womens coaches and who was also the first to break the news regarding the differences in Covid tests between the two tournaments characterized the inequities as a lifelong issue. senior UCLA womens basketball player Michaela Onyenwere echoed both statements remarking that this is just the reality of being a female athlete PERIOD Both the players and the public are seeking answers PERIOD  members of Congress led by U.S PERIOD Representative Mikie Sherrill called on Emmert and the NCAA to honor Title IX and rectify the numerous inequalities PERIOD They demanded a response by April  PERIOD On March  the NCAA announced that it is hiring a law firm to conduct an independent review of its basketball tournaments in all three divisions PERIOD

It is extremely disheartening that an event that is supposed to celebrate the accomplishments of all the athletes involved has been largely overshadowed by the NCAAs disregard for gender equality PERIOD The issue isnt just about the differences between the weight rooms but rather what this and the numerous other inequities signify a total lack of attention to the importance of equality in men and womens college athletics PERIOD Because of the NCAAs failures the coverage of the womens tournament has been shifted from the games which so far have featured exciting play from a highly competitive field of teams to focusing on the NCAAs incapacity to provide equitable experiences for its male and female athletes PERIOD The womens tournament has certainly lived up to the madness the NCAA ascribes solely to the mens tournament but it has been for all the wrong reasons PERIOD",NCAA Tournament Weight Room Disparities Highlight Persisting Gender Inequities,Amherst College
