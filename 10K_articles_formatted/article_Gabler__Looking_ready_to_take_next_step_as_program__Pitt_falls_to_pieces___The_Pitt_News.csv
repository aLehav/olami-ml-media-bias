The Pitt football team had an opportunity for a statement win on Saturday that would have given the program the shot in the arm it needs to step in and be competitive in the ACC next year PERIOD

The Panthers let that opportunity slip out of their hands  or more like sail wide right PERIOD

In the second overtime period of Saturdays game the Panthers blew a shot at ending the game in Irish defeat when a field goal kick by redshirt senior Kevin Harper flew to the right of the goalposts sending the game into a third overtime period in which the Irish ended the game with a  victory PERIOD

After taking a  lead over No PERIOD  Notre Dame heading into the fourth quarter the Panthers fell apart offensively defensively and on special teams PERIOD

Despite the collapse its important to consider what could have been PERIOD What if Pitt had knocked off a BCS national title contender on the road

We dont have to look far to see what the ramifications could have been had Pitt pulled out the upset victory PERIOD Five years ago Pitt shocked No PERIOD  West Virginia which had all but packed its bags for the BCS National Championship and the football program got the shot of adrenaline it desperately needed PERIOD

Coming off the dramatic  victory over the hated rival in  thenhead coach Dave Wannstedt kicked his recruiting into gear PERIOD Following the upset he added  recruits and finished with the No PERIOD  recruiting class in the country according to Rivals.com PERIOD

Tino Sunseri Mike Shanahan Shayne Hale Jarred Holley Joe Trebitz and Andrew Taglianetti are the remaining players who committed to Pitt in the wake of that epic win  a win that promised brighter horizons and a return to college footballs upper echelon PERIOD

Saturdays  tripleovertime loss will go down as one of the seniors toughest losses especially given the multiple times that they felt as though they had the game won PERIOD

A couple of times I thought we had it sealed Trebitz said PERIOD Thats why you play to the last whistle PERIOD You never know whats going to happen. these redshirt seniors careers havent been what they signed up for nor have they lived up to the hype required to return Pitt to the ranks of the college football elite PERIOD

However they have had some success going  in five years with the program PERIOD What that overall record doesnt say is that Pitt was  in their first two years when most were redshirted or received little playing time PERIOD

Sunseri knows that Saturday presented them with their best chance of leaving a truly lasting mark on Pitt and possibly help amplify the team for the next batch of recruits PERIOD

You want to knock off a topfive team in the country and they are a topfive team in the country Sunseri said PERIOD Theyre a great football team PERIOD We had opportunities and we let them slip. they didnt just let a statement win for  slip PERIOD The Panthers let a win that could have propelled them through the rest of the season and offseason slip PERIOD

While the loss may not affect the future of Pitt football much a win certainly would have PERIOD

With talented local high school players such as wide receivers Robert Foster and Tyler Boyd and offensive tackle Dorian Johnson all still seriously considering Pitt Chryst has the opportunity to turn an average recruiting class into a borderline top25 one PERIOD

With a depleted wide receiving corps Foster and Boyd could instantly receive playing time for the Panthers PERIOD Johnson while it is rare to see a freshman start on the offensive line would add solid talent to arguably the weakest position group on the team PERIOD

Chryst will need to battle through adversity just as his players will as they prepare for Connecticut this Friday night PERIOD

Its going to be hard cornerback Lafayette Pitts said PERIOD We got to move on PERIOD Time wont stop so we just got to keep pushing forward. it will be hard for Chryst to recruit without a signature win but not impossible PERIOD The talent is local giving him a builtin advantage and the thriving offense he established as the offensive coordinator at Wisconsin still attracts recruits PERIOD

It isnt all bad for the firstyear head coach PERIOD Many would agree that Pitt has made massive strides since its seasonopening loss to Youngstown State PERIOD Though disappointing for the Panthers a threepoint tripleovertime loss to a topfive team will certainly seem promising to potential recruits PERIOD

As the season winds down Chryst will need to convince recruits why Pitt is the best choice for them PERIOD For the higherranked recruits other schools they will be eyeing up include Ohio State Alabama Virginia Tech and West Virginia PERIOD

Chrysts work is cut out for him in restocking his Panthers talent level and Im sure he knows how powerful a win would have been PERIOD
