Austin Lagomarsino  Thursday January  

The Toolbox has always served as a column that aims to educate and inform its readership PERIOD Yesterday I read Adam Newmans article Its time to do something about guns in America and was very interested in his claims PERIOD However I noticed very few of the claims were substantiated by data so I began to look into it a little further PERIOD First and foremost I would like to start by agreeing with Mr PERIOD Newman in his assessment of the horrors of the  mass shootings that have occurred since  and affirm that these occurrences are so frightening and tragic that I wholeheartedly agree we need to ensure these events do not occur PERIOD However I am not going to preach about how I believe that should be done PERIOD Rather in Toolbox fashion I want to point out some interesting statistics many people either do not know or simply ignore when making claims about how to fix gun violence PERIOD Now lets look at some of the examples of egregious spree killings Mr PERIOD Newman pointed out Sandy Hook Columbine Virginia Tech and Fort Hood PERIOD What do they all have in common Yes they were all sites of horrifying mass killings but what else How about the fact they were all by law gunfree zones PERIOD Yes even Fort Hood PERIOD As a military base laws passed in  do not allow soldiers to carry around firearms unless the base itself is under military threat at that moment PERIOD The other sites were all schools which are gunfree zones to keep children safe PERIOD The designation of gunfree zone identifies that location as an area full of unarmed people marking these spots as easy targets PERIOD This unintended consequence of these wellintentioned rules demonstrates the paradox of implementing guns laws the only people the laws will affect are law abiding citizens PERIOD By definition criminals are individuals who defy the law PERIOD So if someone is set on performing a shooting which is clearly against the law what is going to stop them from defying another law to get a gun As it turns out not much. percent of gunrelated crimes are committed with an illegally obtained firearm PERIOD Now consider that in  there were  incidents of law abiding American citizens using firearms to defend themselves from a crime PERIOD Many will say there is no need for an assault rifle that the Second Amendment should allow people to have hunting guns but shouldnt protect weapons designed to wage war PERIOD If you read the Second Amendment you will notice it is designed to keep citizens armed in the event they needed to overthrow their government PERIOD At the time that weapon would have been the musket and today that would be a weapon designed for combat such as a semiautomatic assault rifle this argument does not include fully automatic machine guns as those are already extremely heavily regulated PERIOD Now all firearms are not created equal PERIOD I will be the first to tell you an 18thcentury musket is not nearly as scary a weapon as a modern assault rifle PERIOD As Mr PERIOD Newman points out assault rifles have become a major issue in the United States PERIOD These weapons of war are by and away the scariest weapons on the streets right Assault rifles represented approximately . percent of all gun murders in the United States in  PERIOD This astounding statistic means the terrifying military grade weapons the United States armed forces use represent a tiny fraction of gun related incidents PERIOD In fact  FBI data records  murders in the United States with a rifle of any kind including assault weapons PERIOD To put that in context that means these weapons designed for warfare in addition to all other rifles combined in  for  less kills than hammers and clubs  and  less kills than knives  PERIOD As I said before I wont tell you how I would fix the gun problems we have in the United States because frankly I have no idea PERIOD Maybe the solution is increasing the laws to prevent people from getting guns PERIOD Maybe it requires an ideological shift in the United States away from the thought crime is acceptable PERIOD Would you be surprised to learn America has seven times as many people per  in prisons as Europe does . percent of all American adults are in prison PERIOD That stat is high enough to make America number one in the world in incarcerations per capita PERIOD Regardless we need to ensure we have all the facts before we make a decision on our gun laws PERIOD Austin Lagomarsino is a junior aerospace engineering major PERIOD He can be reached at emailprotected  The views expressed in this column are those of the author and not necessarily those of The Observer PERIOD
