1757,2023-10-30,"frame captured from the Christian French show in Boston on Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

Christian French is a pop singer from Indiana who is in the middle of his tour Avalanche PERIOD On Oct PERIOD  he played Brighton Music Hall in Boston and I was able to sit down with him before the show to ask him a few questions about tour producing music and inspiration PERIOD

Your tour is wrapping up at the end of this month in California PERIOD How do you feel about going home in a few weeks with the anticipation of the European leg of the tour starting after the new year

Its been crazy and so quick PERIOD Its like Ah tour is just starting and then in the blink of an eye its like holy sht we have  days of tour left and so Im sad to not be on the road obviously but Im really excited to get home and finish this project PERIOD I kinda had to leave in the middle of making sht and Im really excited to tie up all these loose ends and get this music popping PERIOD So when I do go to Europe in February I have a bunch of new music coming out and new music to play and everything PERIOD

That leads me to my next question What are you working on right now Are you working on an EP or a debut album Whats in the works

Im just over the EP game honestly PERIOD I feel like Ive done that enough and Im ready for something bigger PERIOD Bigger than releasing an EP with a few new songs you know what Im saying I want to release something big for my fans to chew on and so Ive been working on this album for like a year a year and a half now and just been putting so much more detail in it than Ive ever done in any of my other music PERIOD Its been really really really tough at points but its really rewarding when you finally get the one or two songs and it helps it get going PERIOD

Whats been your favorite experience producing music Is there one instance in particular youre fond of

I think the coolest experience about this project has been somy roommate Pink Slip is the producer and we had been roommates for two years and we hadnt worked with each other PERIOD It was always like Oh yeah well get in after our sessions today then you get home and dont want to write another song sometimes PERIOD So it had been two years and we still hadnt worked together and finally were like Fck it lets do a whole week and lets just make music. we ended up making incredible music and now hes like making every song on this project and we work so well together PERIOD It was really cool that it ended up being that I just got to stay in my own house and we would work from like  p.m PERIOD to  a.m PERIOD just because we could and there was no reason to stop the inspiration was flowing PERIOD

So would you say that you benefited from that part of quarantine where you could stay in your house and just produce music

Yeah I will say that I wouldnt have been able to write as much music without COVID and with that I wouldnt have gotten the sht songs out of the way so that I could start writing music that I really want to write PERIOD But at the same time theres just no new source of inspiration and just kinda sitting every day like What am I gonna write about today A lot of times it was just the same thing over and over again PERIOD After a while you get over it and you get into a groove of what works for you PERIOD

Your single Avalanche was released in June earlier this year describing your feelings as your long term relationship began to fizzle out but the beat is very uplifting and happy PERIOD Why did you decide to create this juxtaposition

Thats my favorite thing to do PERIOD I dont feel like every happy song needs to be like Woo Im happy This is an upbeat song I think thats the coolest part is when youre able to turn this sad experience into something that doesnt feel so sad PERIOD It would be kinda depressing if every sad song lyrically is also slow and sad PERIOD I just felt like thats what the feeling of the song was it was a very liberating new found independence PERIOD It just felt right for the song plus its my favorite thing to do PERIOD

What kind of music do you want to produce for your first album

Good music chuckles I guess if were going into the specific style weve been really focused on getting the baseline for organic instruments like guitar electric guitars bass or piano PERIOD From that we build new inventive stuff on top of it PERIOD I had my phases of it but I still love EDM and thats how I actually got into music in the first place with Triegy PERIOD There are very small hints of that in the production because I fck with it and just blending my favorite parts of music Ive been listening to lately PERIOD Lyrically Im trying to paint this whole picture of a continuum of a relationship PERIOD The start before you meet them when you meet them when youre in peak love when youre plateauing when youre falling apart PERIOD Im just trying to cover this whole spectrum and that covers feelings of instrumentals as well PERIOD I dont need every song to be a fast pop hit to tell the story PERIOD

Where do you find your inspiration for songwriting Just in your experiences

Yeah Its different PERIOD Mostly I would say its my experiences and just gathering whats happened in the past month or two months and trying to put it down on paper PERIOD But then theres times when Im watching a movie that is inspiring as fck and you know those movies where after you just have that feeling of damn like what the fck did I just watch

Sure PERIOD What movie are you thinking of in particular

Bohemian Rhapsody specifically PERIOD I watched that and I laid in bed and just wrote a whole song PERIOD

One for your new album

Potentially one of many I also find that I feed really well off the feeling of instrumentals PERIOD So if Im playing some chords or my producer is playing some stuff that he just started its usually a really good liftoff for me to dive into that feeling and figure out what to say after that PERIOD

So where do you typically write your songs Do you have a safe space such as your bedroom that a lot of your writing takes place in

I feel like a lot of ideas are started in my bedroom by myself whether its concepts or chords or certain lines PERIOD As far as finishing the music goes I go across the kitchen into the studio PERIOD Thats where we finish music a lot of the time is in that studio PERIOD I havent been writing by myself as much lately and its something that I want to do more of moving forward PERIOD Ive been loving finding the right people and collaborating with them because you can sit in your room and toy all over something all day and it could be good but you arent convinced yourself that its good PERIOD You keep shooting your own ideas down PERIOD When you have somebody that you trust and youre able to bounce ideas off of it helps the process go smoother and you get out things you wouldnt have originally thought of PERIOD

Going off that who would you want to collaborate with next if you had a choice

Oh man I think John Mayer is a huge one PERIOD Hes always the answer but its such an unrealistic thing PERIOD I also think Dominic Fike is cool as fck PERIOD Other artists I really want to work with Ashe weve written a couple of songs together but havent really finalized anything to put it out PERIOD Benee I also think is super fcking rad PERIOD Role Model is really rad that crowd of people PERIOD

Fans are heavily anticipating the release of your song Oh Well PERIOD Some have even gotten tattoos for the song before its debut How does that make you feel and what are your emotions on releasing that single

I have a really weird feeling right now because its supposed to be out already and I really just had it yanked from under me and now I have no idea when its coming out PERIOD So Im in this weird position feeling like Im trying to play catch up with getting people to presave it and sht like that PERIOD I dont know it kind of ruins my excitement honestly for a second but I know that as soon as I get a date for it to come out on Ill be so fcking ready PERIOD Ive been so excited about this song for like seven months now and I had to keep it a secret until recently PERIOD I wrote this song after such a shtty day and its turned into such a beautiful thing that so many people can relate to PERIOD

You were a premed major at Indiana University do you think you would still be exploring that career path if music did not work out for you

Totally PERIOD I dont know if I would be a doctor or anything but definitely something in that sphere PERIOD I still follow lovescience PERIOD Im the nerd in the van that listens to science podcasts between cities still PERIOD

Whats your favorite podcast to listen to right now

I know this is cliche but I really do fck with the Joe Rogan ones that have to do with science and stuff like that PERIOD Those have been great so has Aubrey Marcus podcast PERIOD The Tim Ferriss Podcast is a really good one PERIOD Im just saying a bunch of names now PERIOD It just depends on what youre looking for PERIOD Aubrey Marcus is really good for the spiritual side of things PERIOD Tim Ferriss is really good at combining everyday health with your spiritual side PERIOD I always want to know how to best treat my body so that its working its best PERIOD

What influences your stage performance

A lot The last time I played at this venue I was with Chelsea Cutler PERIOD A lot of it comes from watching Chelsea on her tour because I had no fcking clue what I was doing PERIOD Going on the Quinn XCII tour and watching him every single night and sponging up what worked in their set and what didnt and taking all of that and putting it in my own shows and style PERIOD Ive gone to some dance classes because Im so crusty and white PERIOD Doing all that and just watching other artists do their thing PERIOD They look dope and I want to see what I can do to look dope as well PERIOD

What is a dream venue for you to play at

Red Rocks is so fcking cool so there PERIOD And then I dont know what room in Indianapolis but Old National would be really cool PERIOD I just played Old National but I didnt play in the big room PERIOD So the big room of Old National PERIOD

If you could tell your  year old self anything what would it be

I dont know because theres the argument of sht unfolding exactly how it should and now were here in the present moment PERIOD But I was not seriously making music until I was  so if I could tell my  year old self to start taking that sht seriously thats just two more years of experience I could have PERIOD I am continuously kicking myself for not learning guitar earlier so now Im finally learning and Im getting good at it but I could be so much better right now PERIOD A big goal of mine is to eventually write produce play the instruments for the most part on a full album and really do it myself PERIOD



Thats a great goal to have My last question for you is what is your goto karaoke song

Its funny you say that PERIOD Especially on tour if we go somewhere with karaoke I dont sing because I want to save my voice for the shows PERIOD Sweet Caroline always happens PERIOD Every single time I go to karaoke they always play that song PERIOD I dont know I never do karaoke which is ironic PERIOD
