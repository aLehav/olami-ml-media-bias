Hillary Clinton officially announced that she is running for president Sunday with a YouTube video posted on her website and Twitter PERIOD

Clinton went very broad with her appeal in the video featuring single moms immigrants a gay couple young college graduates older retirees and new families pretty much encompassing everyone in America PERIOD

Naturally due to the bipartisan structure of American politics Hillary is receiving a lot of flack PERIOD More importantly so are her supporters PERIOD

Social media has blown up with Hillary haters saying things like Youre just voting for her because shes a woman. just because women everywhere are showing support for Hillary doesnt mean they are voting for her based on the fact that she is a woman PERIOD Would the same women vote for Sarah Palin for president Likely not as the two candidates have very distinctly different takes on many issues PERIOD

A similar thing happened when Obama ran for president as white people everywhere claimed that all the black people were voting for Obama just because he is black which is funny because there were probably many people voting for John McCain because he isnt black PERIOD

Just like how there are probably many people out there not voting for Hillary because she is a woman PERIOD

No one would accuse a man of voting for Hillary just because shes a woman. accusing women of doing so grossly discredits a womans ability to make a decision PERIOD The argument sounds like it is coming from people who would probably be on the opposite side of the womens suffrage movement PERIOD

There are many reasons women are showing support for Hillary one being the fact that she is very prowoman in her stances on womens issues PERIOD If a man were to have the same stances he would have the same support from women PERIOD

Voting for a candidate based on a superficial aspect of their being like gender or race is not the best way to choose no matter who is running PERIOD Examining the issues is the only way to choose what candidate to vote for PERIOD
