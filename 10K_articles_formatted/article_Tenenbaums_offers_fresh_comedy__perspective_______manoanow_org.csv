Woody Allen once said that comedy equals tragedy plus time PERIOD
While this equation might seem a bit cold and unfunny this is the
basic principle behind 

The movie is the third collaboration between cowriters Wes
Anderson and Owen Wilson who also wrote two of the funniest films
of the nineties   and   PERIOD

Wilson and Anderson revisit many of the themes from their
previous films children writing plays jumpsuits and strange
kids PERIOD

The structure of the film at times plays out like a novel and at
other times like one of the characters plays adding as much
visual humor as the films dialogue PERIOD

The story revolves around the Tenenbaum family an eccentric
group living in New York PERIOD The children are all prodigies Margot
Gwenyth Paltrow a playwright Richie Luke Wilson a tennis
champion and Chas Ben Stiller a financial genius PERIOD

As adulthood sets in the children who were once successful
have now become neurotic shadows of their former selves PERIOD

Royal Tenenbaum Gene Hackman left his children when they were
younger and has been estranged from them for many years showing up
only to criticize Margots plays or take money from Chas
vault PERIOD

Royal shows up again announcing that he is dying of stomach
cancer thus trying to get to know his children again in his final
days PERIOD

One of the peculiarities of this film is its ability to
manipulate the audiences emotions PERIOD There are several scenes where
the audience must ask themselves if they should be laughing at or
be concerned for the characters PERIOD

Consider Chas Tenenbaum His wife was killed in a plane crash a
year ago leaving only his two sons and the family dog who
miraculously survived the crash PERIOD

Fearing that his family may succumb to yet another tragedy he
dresses them in bright red jumpsuits and has constant safety drills
to test his children PERIOD

On one hand we see the neurotic character of a man behaving
excessively and on the other we see a man whose family means the
world to him and he lives in fear of losing them PERIOD

In another scene where Royal wants to visit his wifes grave he
remembers that Chas wife is buried in the same cemetery and
brightly suggests they visit both sites  like killing two birds
with one stone PERIOD The audience laughs but almost cautiously PERIOD

Each character has somehow suffered a strange tragedy and as a
result has become wildly neurotic PERIOD Perhaps what is so funny about
each of these characters is that despite their somewhat outlandish
behavior it all makes sense in the context of their lives PERIOD

We dont see them as sideshow freaks we see them as normal
people surviving strange circumstances PERIOD

In a time when comedic films are in the doldrumsand the only
popular movies are war epics andoverzealous teen movies it is
satisfying to see a filmthat leaves pop culture on the doorstep and
makes itsown niche PERIOD

Unlike its pop culture contemporaries 
will have a shelf life for years to come.It does not rely on other
movies or events to tell itsstory it relies on its own PERIOD
