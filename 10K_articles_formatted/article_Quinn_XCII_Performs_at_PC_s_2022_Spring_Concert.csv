Two years ago the Providence College student body was excited to return to campus after spring break to see Two Friends and Matoma perform at Spring Concert  but the world had other plans PERIOD Yet throughout the COVID19 pandemic the Friar community showed resilience and perseverance making it possible for Spring Concert to return to campus for the first time in three years last Saturday April  PERIOD

This years concert took place in Peterson Recreation Center and was headlined by Quinn XCII and featured opener DJ Clockwork PERIOD It was the mostattended Spring Concert in PCs history a testament to how the campus community is truly soaking in every inperson moment of this school year PERIOD As Quinn XCII sings This is All Weve Ever Wanted Look How Far Weve Come. bOPs Entertainment committee chaired by Gracie Higgins  has been working tirelessly all year to make Spring Concert happen after receiving some pushback from the administration related to safety concerns PERIOD Higgins said of the concert Its absolutely incredible as its the first Spring Concert that anyone on the Board has worked because of COVID19 PERIOD It has been incredible to watch it come into place behind the scenes something that none of us had been able to experience before from this angle. quinn XCII got his start on SoundCloud and achieved more mainstream success with his songs like Love Me Less with MAX Stacy and Stay Next to Me featuring Chelsea Cutler who performed at PC in January  PERIOD

When asked why the board selected Quinn XCII for Spring Concert Higgins said We chose him because he is a fun upandcoming artist and one that a variety of students will enjoy regardless of their music taste PERIOD He also embodies a lot of Providence Colleges values such as loving one another enjoying yourself and having a good time. the doors to Peterson opened at  P.M. and students filed in over the course of the next two hours until Quinn XCII hit the stage PERIOD He played for over an hour performing some of his most wellknown songs and repping a number  PC Hockey jersey PERIOD During his set he mentioned that he has a strong connection to Rhode Island he wrote his newest album Change of Scenery II in Newport last year PERIOD

PCs campus has not had a normal spring semester since  so with this years seniors graduating Spring Concert and other secondsemester campus traditions stood to be forgotten if they did not take place this year PERIOD As Higgins pointed out Spring Concert was on the verge of being lost entirely as a tradition for PC PERIOD As a senior this year and not having one since I was a freshman if there wasnt one this year it might have been lost as a tradition. it is all about the scenery along the route so to the Class of  and the rest of the student body enjoy the last few weeks of the yearand enjoy another day in paradise PERIOD
