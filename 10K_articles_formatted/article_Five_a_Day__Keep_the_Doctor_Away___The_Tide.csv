Healthy eating and a balanced diet are important for so many reasons a general health good immune system physical health and physique PERIOD I dont mean the diet of a super skinny super model or an animal on the cover of Mens Health nor do I mean a green tea only diet or just apples for each meal of the day because lets face it most of you guys want to have a normal life PERIOD Right However making a conscious effort not to have Five Guys every day would go a long way and eating relatively healthy will completely lift your mood

Being an athlete as well as living in a house full of athletes we are all eating pretty well most of the time and the one food that we love and live off of is eggs We go through about four or five twelve packs each week PERIOD As students eggs are just a perfect source for our balanced diet they are cheap rich in protein versatile beyond belief and if you have them with toast or bread youve then made a nutritionally balanced meal with carbs and protein PERIOD

However cooking eggs when you dorm on campus can be a tricky task I suppose PERIOD Especially when you indulge in the campus Michelin star food court Winnick PERIOD But instead of eating multiple slices of pizza or having a waffle with syrup for breakfast every morning mix it up throw some lettuce in with the chicken parm or have a glass of water with every meal PERIOD

Of course having the choice of eating or drinking anything you want is a perk that comes along with the western civilization we all live in but before you have that second or third cookie stop and think no I have had one because the hardest thing when you are looking after your diet is trying not to overindulge when you have the opportunity to PERIOD

Although we have spoken about this a few times in other issuesover the semester and many of you gasped and snubbed at the ideaof working out that too helps to keep a healthy lifestyle PERIOD It actually provides a justification when you do eat at Five Guys or you do have that extra cookie PERIOD If I eat a really unhealthy meal such as a SmashBurger or a pizza I just say to myself that Ill burn it off in the gym PERIOD

This lets me have a few treats and unhealthy meals here and there PERIOD But obviously if you have a good balanced meal which means having a source of carbohydrates proteins minerals fats vitamins fibers and salts as well as paying the gym a visit every now and again your body is going to reap the benefits

One motivation to keep an eye on your diet is to make sureyou dont look like the guys on biggest loser where letting yourselfgo and not giving any fs when it comes to your diet can result in severe problems PERIOD We dont all have to look like Victorias Secret models or Captain America but just a small amount of effort to try and keep the balance of nutrition goes a long way and as we are all college students many of us drink on the weekends PERIOD

Imagine all the calories from drinking unless you have a vodkasoda a zerocalorie alcoholic beverage which my teammate Jason Lampkin does enjoy but then again he does belong on the cover of Mens Health and then obviously having your slice of pizza next door to Dizzies then having a bad diet throughout the week PERIOD This can all take its toll on the fat content in your body PERIOD

So just dont have multiple Five Guys in a week keep hydrated and make sure you have a balanced diet with every meal PERIOD For you guys on campus Winnick isnt the best but its not an excuse either PERIOD You can definitely get a source of everything that you need
