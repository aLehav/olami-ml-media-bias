Chico made the top   no not the Playboy Top Party Schools the Best Art Towns in America PERIOD

John Villani author of The  Best Art Towns in America A Guide to Galleries Museums Festivals Lodging and Dining knows that Chico has more to offer than wild parties and has rated Chico tenth in the United States for towns with populations between  and  PERIOD

Chico listed along with towns like Boulder Colo. and Santa Fe N.M. was the only California town to make the top  PERIOD

Villani said his criteria for rating the towns were flexible but Chico ranked highly because the community is supportive accessible and art oriented. he was invited to Chico by the Arts Commission in October  while writing the fourth edition of his book and was impressed by the availability of cheap studio and rehearsal space and the extensive oncampus art galleries he said PERIOD

Kathy Barrett Arts Commission chair said Villani seemed most impressed with Chicos diversity PERIOD

Barrett said Villani liked that Chico is a college town with a lot of agriculture around it but theres still a lot of art and things to do. i always look for communities that are a bit off the beaten path but that still have a lot to offer culturally he said PERIOD

Villani was impressed by the large number of independent businesses downtown and said the fact that there is art on the walls in most of the Chico businesses shows that the community is supportive and takes a great deal of pride. the arts community itself is very supportive of each other he said PERIOD

Villani said Chico State plays an important role in the art culture PERIOD

In his book Villani notes Chico States Laxson Auditorium Performing Arts Center Janet Turner Print Gallery and Humanities Center Gallery PERIOD

At Chico State theres an emphasis on performing arts and the presentation of national musicians actors and entertainers Villani said in his book PERIOD

Arts education major Richard Gray said The community is really supportive of our programs and the faculty is unbelievable. if people hear good quality things coming out of Chico State theyre going to want to support the arts in the area Gray said and I think the school has set a reputation for that. villanis book also included praise of offcampus venues and galleries like The Vagabond Rose Gallery  Framing  Gallery Chico Art Center the Blue Room Theatre the Senator Theater Open Studios and Chico Performances PERIOD

Villani suggests Sicilian Cafe Red Tavern and Moxies Cafe and Gallery as places to wine and dine PERIOD

He said things like the Chico Farmers Market contribute to the artistic appeal of the town PERIOD

There are things to do places to go people to see Villani said PERIOD Its certainly anything but a boring place to live. but he said the art culture will not survive on atmosphere alone PERIOD

To maintain its status as an art town Chico needs to sustain affordable studio space for its artists Villani said PERIOD Affordability is an issue that needs to be advocated. villani will be in Chico for a book signing on April  at Dovetail Designs  E PERIOD Third Ave PERIOD The signing will be followed by dinner at Red Tavern PERIOD On April  he will be signing books at Lyon Books  Learning Center  W PERIOD Fifth St PERIOD

The fourth edition of The  Best Art Towns in America A Guide to Galleries Museums Festivals Lodging and Dining will be released April  PERIOD

Chico really has a hidden story Villani said PERIOD

He said he hopes the book will help draw at the aspects of Chico that arent as well known. jennifer Scholtes can be reached at
