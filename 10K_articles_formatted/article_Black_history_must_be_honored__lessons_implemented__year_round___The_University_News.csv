3643,2018-10-10,"much like religious beliefs and the roundness of the earth the celebration of Black History Month is becoming something of a dead dogma PERIOD

Many of the same controversies about Black History Month circulate as February approaches Why do we have a month dedicated to the history of only one race Why is it February the shortest month of the year And why do we stop learning about Black history after February is over

Then there are proponents of the month who for the most part fail to actively understand its importance and take it for granted.Let us all take this month to reminisce not only about Black history itself but also why it is important that we have such a month in the first place PERIOD

The point of Black History Month is not the  days of February  this year it is not the events we attend it is not the educational and cultural high we experience afterwards either PERIOD Black History Month should not be treated as an educational Lent devoted entirely to thinking and learning about Black history feeling little obligation to do so afterward PERIOD Black history matters every day of the year PERIOD The lessons we can learn during Black History Month events are jewels to carry all our lives PERIOD

Let us remember the struggle of civil rights leaders such as Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. and that it is not only the struggle that counts but the accomplishments that were made during the struggle PERIOD In a way all of us at one point and in some capacity will have to live through a struggle PERIOD The accomplishments we make during times of struggle as well as accomplishments we make during times of peace and rest are the things that make history PERIOD

Furthermore having one month dedicated to Black history should carry no implications about the way we remember Black history PERIOD

Just because one might dedicate one day out of the week to communal worship or one day out of the year to the celebration of ones birth does not mean that communal worship or ones birth is irrelevant and insignificant the other days of the year PERIOD The celebration of Black History Month is a necessary annual reminder that lessons we can draw from this part of American history should be implemented during the entire year PERIOD

More specifically let us revive what civil rights are every day of the year and acknowledge that the fight for civil rights does not stop with the end of racism PERIOD

We celebrate Black history because it is a solid embodiment of accomplishment struggle courage moral responsibility and civil disobedience and it is a vital example of everything our society needs but lacks in cases of everyday injustices PERIOD

The spirit of social justice from Black history must be carried on in the twenty-first century to protect the rights of all individuals in spite of and because of their differences PERIOD This cannot be forgotten PERIOD A revival of knowledge of this important part of American history once a year be it for a mere moment  days or  is imperative to improve and build the future PERIOD
