DECORAH Iowa  Statistics say a lot but not everything and Saturdays game against a tripleoption Luther team was indicative of that for one reason PERIOD Luther absolutely dominated in the time of possession battle  to  a scary notion with the secondmost run heavy team in the nation but Simpson was much more efficient as it won  in the season finale PERIOD

After a scoreless first quarter in which Simpson punted in its first two drives Luther   IIAC established a  lead at  in the second quarter on a Brady Letney touchdown pass to Jon Cochrane PERIOD

The Storm   IIAC not only took the lead but they never let go of it from then on out scoring in six of the next seven possessions  including a  point outburst in the second quarter PERIOD

Dj vu

Simpson scored in flurries to help mask the lopsided time of possession margin PERIOD

Tied  running back Jordan Beem gave the Norse defense a reoccurring nightmare when he ran for two touchdowns within  seconds of each other putting Simpson up  late in the third quarter to put the foot down on the Norse PERIOD

Beems first rushing touchdown in the sequence and second on the day was a 12yarder PERIOD

Simpson took a shot on the kickoff with an onside attempt and it worked as Luther fumbled it giving the Storm the ball at the Norse  PERIOD

This time Beem had to go double the distance for the score but he did with equal ease scampering into the end zone on the first play from scrimmage after the fumble recovery PERIOD

Luther had only a few more gasps left but their final bit of hope was snuffed out when Jake Stearns sacked Letney on fourth and five from the Simpson  with about six minutes left to play PERIOD

Stearns play was huge considering the Storm gave up a  fourth quarter lead against Luther last season allowing the Norse to score  unanswered to win PERIOD

Shortening the field

Luther managed to outgain Simpson  but field position proved to be more important PERIOD Six times Simpson started with the ball at least at its own 40yard line and three times in Luther territory  including on Simpsons last possession after forcing the Norse into a turnover on downs PERIOD

The Storm scored four touchdowns during those six possessions helping quell the effects of a Norse rushing attack that put up  rushing yards on  carries PERIOD

Interesting to note

Luther had only passed the ball  times second fewest in Division III for . yards per game fewest in Division III and a whopping zero touchdowns before Saturdays game PERIOD

While they only passed eight times for  yards Luther passed for its first two touchdowns of the season in their loss PERIOD

Return man

Last week Davey Jergens set a singlegame school record for most kickoff return yards  and kickoff returns  in Simpsons shootout loss to Wartburg PERIOD

With three returns for  yards on Saturday Jergens ended the season as the Iowa Conference leader in total kickoff return yards  and kickoff return average . pERIOD

Lazer Beem

Beem polished off a allconference worthy year with a season and careerhigh  yards rushing to give him eight 100plus rushing games on the year and seven in a row to finish the season PERIOD

In total Beem ended the season with a conferencebest  rushing yards and  touchdowns numbers certainly worthy of a firstteam AllIIAC selection PERIOD His season rushing yards total ranks seventh in Simpson football history PERIOD

Beem also ran for a 52yard touchdown earlier in the game on his way to three rushing touchdowns on the day PERIOD The junior from Southeast Polk High School hadnt done that since Oct PERIOD   against Loras PERIOD

The Fryer got hot

Simpson will look forward to having Caleb Frye for two more years PERIOD

After showing an impressive athleticism early in the season Frye finally began to smooth things out and really come into his own late in the season PERIOD

Frye was  of  for  yards and three touchdown passes on Saturday finishing the last three games of the season with  of  for  yards eight touchdown passes and only one pick PERIOD
