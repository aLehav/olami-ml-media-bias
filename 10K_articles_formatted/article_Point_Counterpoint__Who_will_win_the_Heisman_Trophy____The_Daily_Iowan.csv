Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa looks to throw against Louisville during the Camping World Kickoff at Camping World Stadium in Orlando Florida. on Saturday Sept PERIOD   PERIOD Stephen M PERIOD DowellOrlando SentinelTNS

November  

Tua Tagovailoa

With just a few weeks left in the regular season the Heisman Trophy contenders continue to dwindle down as Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has started to pull away from the pack PERIOD

His lead got even bigger last weekend when he lit up the vaunted LSU defense in Tiger Stadium for  yards and  total touchdowns next to just  pick PERIOD

It was the biggest game of the season for Alabama and Tagovailoa helped turn it into a statement win for the Crimson Tide PERIOD

What helps make Tagovailoa the clear favorite here is the fact that last weekends performance was arguably his worst of the season PERIOD

His passer rating numbers back that up PERIOD Before the Nov PERIOD  game against LSU Tagovailoas lowest rating in a game was . pERIOD On Saturday it was . pERIOD

This season Tagovailoa has accumulated  total yards and  total touchdowns with a completion percentage of  percent while only throwing  interception PERIOD

Oh and hes only had to play in the fourth quarter once PERIOD

Sure Kyler Murray and Dwayne Haskins have been entertaining this year but both have lost bigtime games PERIOD Tagovailoa hasnt PERIOD

Jordan Zuniga



Kyler Murray

Kyler Murray is the best player in college football but hes not even a football player PERIOD

Hes technically a member of the Oakland Athletics who was granted a season of college football by his employer and boy does he look good PERIOD

Murray has thrown for  yards and  touchdowns in just nine games this season PERIOD Hes also ran for  yards and  touchdowns PERIOD

Hes the most electrifying player in all of college football hes got the footwork and speed of Michael Vick and the arm strength of an NFL quarterback PERIOD

Oklahoma is just outside the topfour for the College Football Playoffs right now but if the Sooners can sneak in itll be interesting to see what he does against some of the countrys best competition PERIOD

His best game of  by far came against Baylor PERIOD Murray threw for  yards and  touchdowns PERIOD He added  yards and a score on the ground PERIOD

Adam Hensley



Dwayne Haskins

Dwayne Haskins has thrown the ball a lot this year He had  attempts against Purdue on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD Who does that PERIOD But Haskins has made the most of his opportunities PERIOD

The sophomore from Potomac Maryland has eclipsed the 300yard mark on six separate occasions this year while throwing for  three times PERIOD

Thats a big reason why Ohio State ranks third in the country with . passing yards per game trailing only Washington State and Texas Tech both of which are known for their air raid tactics on offense PERIOD

It just proves how instrumental Haskins has been to the Buckeyes success this season PERIOD

Haskins is also tied for No PERIOD  in the country with Hawaiis Cole McDonald with  touchdown passes topping other Heisman hopefuls such as Tua Tagovailoa Kyler Murray Will Grier and Gardner Minshew PERIOD

Haskins hasnt had a bad game all year PERIOD Even in Ohio States  loss to Purdue he threw for  yards and  touchdowns PERIOD

The Buckeyes havent had a quarterback win the Heisman since Troy Smith accomplished the feat in  PERIOD That year Smith threw for  yards and  touchdowns PERIOD

Haskins has already shattered those marks just nine games in PERIOD Give the man the Heisman PERIOD

Pete Ruden

Will Grier

I just want to start this off by saying when I Googled Heisman Trophy an article on Will Grier was the first thing that came up PERIOD Coincidence I think not PERIOD

Lets follow that tidbit up with the fact that he has a . percent completion rate which is nice PERIOD

In all seriousness Grier averages . passing yards per game and has a season total of  which is good PERIOD But if the numbers arent enough for you his highlight reel of Nov PERIOD  against Texas should be PERIOD

He threw for  yards after completing  of his  pass attempts and throwing for  touchdowns PERIOD To end the game a touchdown and a quarterback rush into the end zone for a 2point conversion gave West Virginia a 1point win to bump up into the top10 of the rankings PERIOD

The entire game was a reel for Griers Heisman rsum and despite the wide field of contenders hes hard to overlook PERIOD
