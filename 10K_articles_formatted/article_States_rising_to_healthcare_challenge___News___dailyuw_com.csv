WASHINGTON  Healthcare reform may be dead in Washington but a growing number of states  under both Republicans and Democrats  are taking steps to expand medical insurance coverage PERIOD

Faced with a problem they find increasingly hard to ignore governors and legislators in at least  states have hammered out agreements to expand access to healthcare by squeezing money from existing health programs and taking other politically difficult steps including some tax hikes PERIOD

In Illinois Democratic Gov PERIOD Rod Blagojevich is about to sign a bill providing affordable health coverage for uninsured children of working parents PERIOD And Massachusetts has taken on a much bigger challenge PERIOD There Republican Gov PERIOD Mitt Romney and the Democratic legislature are negotiating over competing plans to cover all of the states halfmillion uninsured residents PERIOD

 said Alan R PERIOD Weil executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy PERIOD 

Given the seemingly intractable economics of healthcare it is not clear whether the states will be able to sustain the efforts they have launched PERIOD Controlling costs continues to be difficult PERIOD States revenues can fluctuate PERIOD And many are legally barred from running deficits PERIOD

But traditional employerbased coverage the cornerstone of the old system continues to shrink as the average cost of a family plan approaches  a year PERIOD And some experts think the modest but growing efforts by states could help jumpstart a national debate PERIOD

 said Robert Blendon a public opinion analyst at the Harvard School of Public Health PERIOD 

The renewed interest in expanding coverage is unexpected PERIOD

Earlier this year headlines focused on Medicaid cutbacks in Tennessee and Missouri which are expected to leave tens of thousands without coverage PERIOD And Floridas experiment with managed care for its poor is being watched warily by liberals PERIOD

But a study by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured released in October found that  states increased access to healthcare in the  months that ended in July PERIOD In nine states those expansions reversed previous cuts PERIOD For example Texas rescinded premium increases that had contributed to  lowincome children losing coverage PERIOD

By comparison  states took action that had the effect of limiting healthcare access in most cases by raising premiums for programs covering lowincome kids PERIOD

The Kaiser study found that more states are expanding coverage because budgetary pressures have eased somewhat PERIOD

States have not shied away from controversial proposals PERIOD

Romney of Massachusetts backs a proposal requiring that individuals obtain health insurance much as they are required to have automobile insurance PERIOD Individuals could enroll in an employer or government plan or purchase a policy PERIOD Subsidies would be provided for those with low incomes PERIOD

 Blendon said PERIOD Some conservatives see such an insurance mandate as tantamount to a tax increase and at the national level President Bush has remained aloof from the idea PERIOD

Romney is also at odds with many Democratic lawmakers who believe employers should be the ones required to provide coverage PERIOD The Massachusetts debate may extend into next year but activists on both sides say chances for a deal appear to be good PERIOD

 said Richard C PERIOD Lord president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts a business federation trying to stop an employer mandate PERIOD

 agreed John E PERIOD McDonough executive director of Health Care for All a consumer group PERIOD

 said McDonough a former college professor PERIOD 

Other states have opted for a more limited strategy than the one being pursued in Massachusetts focusing on small businesses that employ lowwage workers PERIOD

Oklahoma recently started to enroll small companies and their employees in a program that will subsidize premiums for private health insurance PERIOD The effort is largely financed by a tobacco tax increase that state voters approved last year PERIOD

 said Cindy Roberts associate director of Oklahomas Medicaid program PERIOD 

Maine approved a program aimed at small businesses two years ago but its complexity has made it a target for critics PERIOD Financing for the initiative depends substantially on achieving savings through greater efficiency in the operation of the states overall healthcare system savings which are difficult to estimate PERIOD Interest in signing up for the plan has been lukewarm PERIOD

Illinois is hoping its All Kids plan will be a model of simplicity PERIOD The idea is to make affordable insurance available to more than  children whose parents make too much to qualify for existing state and federal programs PERIOD A family of four making  to  a year would pay a monthly premium of  per child well below the going rate for private coverage PERIOD

Annette Akey a real estate broker from the Chicago suburb of Carol Stream said the program would allow her to obtain coverage for a 6yearold daughter who suffers from a kidney problem and a mild form of autism PERIOD

 Akey said PERIOD 

Bethzaida Barriera said her three kids were healthy but she couldnt afford the nearly  a month it would cost her to buy coverage for them through her employer PERIOD

 said Barriera who manages a temporary labor agency in Chicago PERIOD 

The states cost for the program  estimated at  million a year  is being paid for with savings from better management of Medicaid patients with chronic diseases PERIOD

 Blagojevich said PERIOD
