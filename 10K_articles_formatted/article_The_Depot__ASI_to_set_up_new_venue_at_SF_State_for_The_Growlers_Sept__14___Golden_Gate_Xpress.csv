The Depot Lineup

When    Friday Sept PERIOD 

Where Lower recreation and dining level Cesar Chavez Student Center

But despite it usually being full of jovial students The Depot is small and the leadership of the venue wants to expand to bigger and better thingsand at no cost to SF State students which is why Sept PERIOD  they are doing just that PERIOD

The Depot has teamed up with Associated Students Inc.s program services to set up a stage on the lower recreation and dining level to accommodate the psychedelic rock band The Growlers PERIOD The Orange Countybased music group is expected to draw a crowd of hundreds much more than The Depot can safely contain PERIOD

This maneuver was inspired by The Growlers first visit to SF State last spring PERIOD The concert at The Depot drew an unexpectedly large crowd making it difficult for security staff to safely monitor the audience PERIOD The Depot staff recognized the potential hazard and also saw an opportunity to create a more accessible and audiencefriendly experience PERIOD

We wanted to be able to accommodate a bigger space Aimee Barnes assistant director for program services said PERIOD We also wanted to explore using different parts of the building. this is not the first time The Depot has used the lower dining area to set a stage for an event PERIOD They first experimented with this for last semesters Battle of the Bands PERIOD

That was the tester the guinea pig event Gio Acosta manager of The Depot said PERIOD It went smoothly so that was the green light to use this sort of approach in the future. acosta notes however that Fridays show is not going to be reminiscent of last semesters Battle of the Bands and that this is mainly due to the expected attendance of more than  people PERIOD

Well be able to handle it the more the merrier Acosta said PERIOD But well have precautions set in case we hit our capacity. the event requires the cooperation and coordination of multiple vendors in the student center PERIOD The other vendors on the recreation and dining level are on board mainly because of the attention it would bring to an otherwise lesser known part of the building and the attention it would bring to their businesses PERIOD

Everyone was thinking that it could bring more foot traffic Barnes said PERIOD Everybody is excited to see how this could work. for the large task at hand The Depot enlisted the help of Cesar Chavez Student Centers program services PERIOD Both groups will split the  price tag to fund the event and provide staff to monitor and usher the crowd PERIOD Nearly all of the money spent will go directly to the artists PERIOD

It just made sense said Horace Montgomery director of programs and services for ASI on collaborating with The Depot PERIOD The Depot has the house but doesnt have the budget PERIOD We ASI have a bigger budget but we dont have the house. aside from splitting the bill ASI is helping with promotion of the show and security PERIOD About nine staff members made up from ASI and The Depot staff will be at the stairs and elevator leading down the to recreation and dining level to conduct bag checks for weapons and alcohol PERIOD The security staff will also be responsible for controlling the capacity of the crowd if it gets unmanageable PERIOD

Despite the work involved both staffs insist that the students are worth it PERIOD

I spent a lot of my undergrad time at The Depot Montgomery said PERIOD Its all about giving students something to do and bringing as much city life and campus life to the students who live here as possible. the Depot and ASI will continue to work together in the future on largescale musical events PERIOD They hope to use the lower level stage setup at least twice a year for more popular groups PERIOD

The show runs from  to  p.m PERIOD Sept PERIOD  and also features Guantanamo Baywatch POW and The Cosmonauts PERIOD The show is completely free for SF State students PERIOD
