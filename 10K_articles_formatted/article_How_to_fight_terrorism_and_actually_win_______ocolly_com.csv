The bombers of tomorrow are being trained today PERIOD In Afghanistan where the fight is supposedly over impoverished and irate extremists are still training PERIOD Their goal is to make Afghanistan the nexus of terror operations PERIOD AlQaida is alive and well there despite the work of military intelligence PERIOD The Northern Alliance now in power in Afghanistan does not support terrorism but isnt doing all it can to help us find any of the  reputed training camps within the country PERIOD



Next door in Pakistan now a U.S PERIOD  support for a Talibanstyle government continues to grow PERIOD This is mainly true in the nations military community where an estimated  percent of enlisted people support such a change PERIOD Pakistan is a perfect example of the kind of ties that our country should not be making PERIOD Dont be surprised if in a decade or two this friendship will come back and bite us PERIOD Then it will be the alltooquicktoforget armchair general with the  bumper sticker on the back of his pickup PERIOD



Terrorists may not be everywhere and they may be scattered and disorganized now but attacks are still possible in time PERIOD They will come back and fight another day as long as they all have a common goal PERIOD That said how are we supposed to halt alQaidas growth The best way remains psychological PERIOD If we want to get serious about fighting terror let us start by attacking peoples reasons for turning to terrorism as a solution to a problem PERIOD We need to be figuring out why they kill and how we can help pacify them by giving them what they consider important enough to kill for PERIOD



Improving the standard of living in angry upstart nations like Afghanistan is an important step in curtailing the recruitment of terrorists but the big problem is in Israel PERIOD We forget sometimes with our massive American egos that we are not the biggest enemy of extremists PERIOD Islamic fundamentalists hate Israelis much more than they could ever hate our country PERIOD The best way to counter terrorism today may well be the establishment of a Palestinian state PERIOD If Palestinians get their own nation and also fair treatment at the hands of Israelis then terrorists would find it more difficult to recruit new zealots for their cause PERIOD Think of it this way You cant hate someone who has been nice to you  even if you really want to hate them PERIOD



We shouldnt worry about  or  while making supplications to terrorists PERIOD When people stop getting bombed and killed  weve won PERIOD



Throughout history it has always been the hungry the tired and the desperate who do the most damage PERIOD In other words when people get pissed off they fight back any way that they can PERIOD



In this case the tools nearest at hand to those who were pissed off just happened to be box cutters and homemade nail bombs PERIOD



World War II could have possibly been prevented if not for the sorry economic state of Germany following sanctions and annexations by the League of Nations following World War I PERIOD War always breaks out when the citizenry is not comfortable PERIOD When people have nothing they are glad to fight PERIOD Once again we must pay attention to history before we have to repeat it PERIOD



Another important realization that our leaders need to have is that terrorists like the ones in alQaida may well see any incursion military or otherwise into Islamic lands as an affront to the entire Islamic world a holy war a jihad PERIOD That is precisely why an invasion in Iraq is probably the worst possible move we could make right now PERIOD



Though Iraq is a secular government many of its citizens are not and it would be easy for people like Osama bin Laden to call the war an invasion on Islam PERIOD Hell love it when we attack Iraq because it will give him greater recruiting power PERIOD Let us not throw gas on the fire PERIOD President Bush often says that the war on terror will require patience and lots of time PERIOD If he believes that then why are we so quick to start throwing bombs around



Bush has also admitted that the war is  If that is true then why are we fighting it with the same old weapons
