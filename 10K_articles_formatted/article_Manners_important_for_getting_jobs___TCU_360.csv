I was always annoyed and a little embarrassed as a kid when I would say yes to an adult and my mom or dad would follow with maam say yes maam. i learned quickly that even though I didnt think it was necessary to use my best manners when talking to the cashier at the grocery store or someone in passing it was important to my parents PERIOD

As I became an adult who now has interviews with companies for jobs and internships I couldnt be more appreciative to my parents and I know they are proud when people are impressed with my manners PERIOD

Have you ever seen people chewing with their mouths wide open at a nice dinner

You hope and pray harder than you ever have that they arent eating what you just ordered because suddenly it doesnt look as appetizing PERIOD

Think about how you act in public now that you are in college PERIOD Would you make your parents proud If your mother saw you at dinner would she be appalled

It isnt just table manners though PERIOD

Do you know how important manners and common courtesy can be when interviewing for jobs

According to a January  USA Today article Liz Hubler executive director of OfficeTeam a Californiabased staffing service specializing in highly skilled administrative professionals said In todays fastpaced business environment its not unusual for people to pay less attention to matters of workplace etiquette and protocol PERIOD

But time spent showing consideration for others is a smart career investment PERIOD People have long memories when it comes to how you treat them and the courtesy you extend will be noticed and reciprocated. here in Texas we have a stereotype that we are often asked to live up to PERIOD

Guys did you know you are still known as southern gentlemen by people anywhere north of Oklahoma

Southern graces arent something from the 1920s PERIOD They are here in the twenty-first century and they need to be respected PERIOD

Does anyone even acknowledge the people around them that are walking around in the mall

If someone drops their books on campus do you stop to help

These examples might not be what you would traditionally consider manners but they are PERIOD

Smiling as you walk past someone on campus or stopping someone to tell them they dropped a pen out of his or her backpack is a simple way to show that you use manners PERIOD

Manners will never go out of style PERIOD

Yes maam No sir Thank you and No thank you will get you further in this world than youd think according to Hubler PERIOD

If you are in a tight race for a job against someone with the same qualifications as yours but you have manners and they dont guess who is more likely to get the position PERIOD You are PERIOD

Having manners is a wonderful asset but they cant do you any good if you dont use them PERIOD

If you are searching for respect from your peers think about how you address them and speak to them PERIOD

If you were in their shoes would you feel respected

You cant get respect until you give it and I cant think of a more perfect place to start than with manners PERIOD

And remember a simple yes doesnt cut it PERIOD Say Yes maam or Yes sir. marissa Warms is a senior advertisingpublic relations major from Irving PERIOD Her column appears Fridays PERIOD",Manners important for getting jobs | TCU 360,Texas Christian University
