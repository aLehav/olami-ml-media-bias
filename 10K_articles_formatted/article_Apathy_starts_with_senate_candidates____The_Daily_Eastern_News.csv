Ladies and gentlemen start your engines  if you can find the ignition that is PERIOD



Its Student Government election time again the two days of the year when student apathy reigns supreme PERIOD Every April the Election Commission runs itself ragged trying to encourage students to stop by the polls and give Student Government pieces of their minds PERIOD

And every April the voter numbers are only slightly short of pathetic PERIOD

Last year  students voted in the Student Senate elections and that was down from the year before PERIOD Thats about  percent of the students enrolled here PERIOD

Tongues were clucked in November when only  percent of the nation turned out for the presidential election PERIOD Election officials around here couldnt get  people to vote if they had kegs at each polling place PERIOD

Its understandable sort of that students dont want to vote for the mayor of a city they dont call home or for a president they feel is out of touch with their generation PERIOD But the Student Senate makes decisions that affect the student body directly and immediately PERIOD

The polling places are even located conveniently  its near impossible to walk around campus for two days without strolling past one PERIOD

But I dont think the problem is the average student PERIOD I think the problem is the average senate candidate and the average senate election PERIOD

Im not going to name names or make specific accusations or criticisms PERIOD But it isnt hard to see that when you look at platforms and qualifications and experience that some people are not only in over their heads but they can no longer even see the surface PERIOD

At the debate Thursday night some things became painfully apparent PERIOD One candidate had to leave because he had an emergency at his fraternity PERIOD It leads one to wonder what he would do if there was a fraternity emergency during say a Student Senate meeting PERIOD

Before the debate each executive candidate from all three parties was asked to name the five executive administrators on campus by position PERIOD One party went  for  PERIOD None of them could associate Carol Surles Lou Hencken Lida Wall Jill Nilsen and Jeff Cooley with the titles they hold PERIOD

Some platform ideas are a little farfetched too PERIOD One candidate wants to push for the auditorium mentioned in the Campus Master Plan to be built as soon as possible PERIOD Say what

Students dont care about a 20000seat fantasy PERIOD They want to be able to park within a halfmile radius of their residence halls PERIOD

There are candidates who havent been within throwing distance of a Student Senate meetings and others who dont seem to have any clue about how the Student Senate is run PERIOD

This is nothing new and not necessarily bad PERIOD Students need a wide range of candidates and they are all well within their rights to enter their names in a political race PERIOD But across the board competence or the appearance of competence probably the most important aspect of a political candidate seems to be a little thin PERIOD

And Student Government knows it PERIOD It stages two informational meetings after the petition deadline for the candidates to learn about the positions theyre running for PERIOD Candidates must attend at least one of those meetings PERIOD

Am I the only one who thinks thats bass ackwards I want a candidate who knows what he or shes supposed to be doing before they get on the ballot PERIOD Essentially you can apply for the job without knowing a thing about it and Student Government would cater to you by teaching what it is youre supposed to be doing PERIOD

I wont even get into the ethical quandary that presents PERIOD

These meetings took place sometime between last Wednesday and tonight PERIOD Our candidates got six days to learn how to lead this campus with its 10000plus students nearly  employees budgets in the hundreds of millions and  years of history PERIOD

And people wonder why were apathetic PERIOD
