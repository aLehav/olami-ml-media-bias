At the beginning of this semester I wrote about why News Literacy should be a required course for students at Florida Gulf Coast University because it benefits students by transforming them into an informed news consumer PERIOD One required class that I do agree with however is University Colloquium PERIOD
Although Im not the biggest fan of being waist deep in swamp water environmental education and awareness is important PERIOD
As clichd as it sounds its true Todays youths are tomorrows leaders PERIOD That is why it is so important for students to be educated about not only the environment itself but how our actions affect the natural world around us PERIOD

Its not just about recycling a few cans and being conscious of what bin youre throwing your paper into  its much bigger than that PERIOD We need to be considerate and conscious of our actions as a human race we depend utterly on the survival of other species PERIOD
As the biologist E.O PERIOD Wilson once said Humans are the masters of this world now PERIOD We can take these animals with us as we travel into the future or we can say goodbye and send them into the night PERIOD Whether we realize it or not we depend on other creatures for our very survival they are a part of our existence they are a part of us. luckily FGCU has many different outlets of environmental education PERIOD Aside from the environmental studies major FGCU offers many courses such as Environmental Humanities Environmental Philosophies and incorporates outreach programs such as Wings of Hope PERIOD Wings of Hope a program that FGCU students participate in as a students in the Environmental Humanities course is an environmental outreach program that simultaneously educates both college and elementary students about the Southwest Florida habitat wildlife and the Florida panther PERIOD
FGCU students are educated on the curriculum that they will then teach the elementary students for servicelearning hours PERIOD Elementary students visit FGCU and the CREW hiking trails as part of a field trip. after the program is completed the FGCU and local elementary students continue spreading awareness by educating their friends and family PERIOD
Colloquium a required course many seniors and upperclassmen take to graduate focuses on the same ideas PERIOD The course description reads The University Colloquium brings together students from all five colleges in a series of interdisciplinarylearning experiences PERIOD These experiences are designed to address the ecological perspective outcome in relations to other University outcomes and guiding principles PERIOD Critical thinking and communication skills will be enhanced through field trips discussion projects and a journal to be maintained by each student. programs such as Wings of Hope as well as required courses like colloquium are great ways to spread awareness and encourage environmental consciousness PERIOD FGCU should continue to fund programs such as these and requiring environmental education courses PERIOD
It is so important to take care of our natural world because whether we realize it or not we depend on the survival of other species PERIOD We only get one world we need to continue to educate students so we can preserve our world for the future PERIOD
