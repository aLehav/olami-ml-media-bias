8177,2023-11-04,"every time I think state legislatures have reached the limit of really stupid ideas Im proven wrong PERIOD In recent years weve had idiotic proposals to limit access to womens health clinics in Texas in Michigan a law requiring women to have rape insurance goes into effect and in Oklahoma they passed a law outlawing Sharia law as if that was even necessary PERIOD But this month from the great state of Idaho comes a law so illconceived only a complete lunatic would love it PERIOD
Apparently in their infinite wisdom the state legislature there decided that whats really missing from Idahos colleges and universities is a body count PERIOD
Well thats not what they said its just what the end result will be PERIOD Effective July  a new law goes into effect that will allow students to carry concealed firearms on campus PERIOD
You read that right  in Idaho it will be legal if you have a concealed carry license to bring your gun to class PERIOD You know just in case a guntoting lunatic decides to shoot up the school PERIOD
I cant imagine the thought process that went into this decision PERIOD It was probably a combination of the usual rightwing platitudes about safety and selfdefense with an unhealthy dose of nonsense about responsible gun owners thrown in PERIOD
The law passed over the objections of every university president in Idaho PERIOD Youd think such expert witnesses  you know the people who will have to deal with the fallout of this nightmare  would have carried some weight but apparently rational thought is considered taboo in Idaho PERIOD
Schools are currently trying to work out the security implications of the new law PERIOD Hopefully theyll adopt alcohol bans on campuses in the wake of this but Im not holding out much hope PERIOD We wouldnt want to interfere with students civil liberties after all PERIOD
The proposal prompted one professor to write a letter to the New York Times entitled When may I shoot a student Though written in a thoroughly tongueincheek tone its intent was serious PERIOD If a professor is going to be in the position of explaining to highstrung stressedout and now potentially armed students why they didnt get a better grade on their midterms he needs to know what the rules of engagement are PERIOD
And does the new law apply only to students or can faculty and staff pack heat as well Where does it end other than in tragedy
But its Idaho you say PERIOD It cant happen here PERIOD
Not so fast PERIOD Thanks to shadowy conservative influence groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council ALEC and others bad ideas tend to spread through state legislatures like herpes at Fort Lauderdale during Spring Break PERIOD Its only a matter of time before this nightmare scenario comes to Nebraska PERIOD
I can only hope that if it does saner heads will prevail and it will die the miserable death it deserves PERIOD
