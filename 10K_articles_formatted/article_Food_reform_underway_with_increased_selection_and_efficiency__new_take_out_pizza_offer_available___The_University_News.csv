3656,2018-10-10,"after much griping standing in long lines and wondering what exactly was in the soup Saint Louis University students have a hope on the horizon in the form of food reformation PERIOD

Recently a small group of Student Government Association and Residence Hall Association members met to discuss student opinions on the food served in dining halls and what things could be done to  improve the service and quality PERIOD

With all the red dots and fried food students were not getting a balanced diet said Peter Brokish Food Committee member PERIOD

It is for this reason that many changes have been made to all of the dining halls PERIOD  These include

 changing the menu cycle to include healthier options

 serving lunch to students in Griesedieck cafeteria to improve customer service and speed up taking food in line

 increased dessert selection and

 expanded juice selection PERIOD

Also beginning on Jan PERIOD  brunch will be extended until  p.m PERIOD on Saturdays and Sundays in all Griesedieck cafeteria PERIOD

The last  of the food changes will begin on Friday Feb PERIOD  PERIOD  On Fridays and Saturdays from  p.m. students will be able to call down to Griesedieck  and order a large one topping pizza and a twoliter of coke PERIOD

The dining hall will be closed at this time but there will also be someone at the door taking orders PERIOD This new trial latenight service will cost students two meals off their dining card PERIOD

This should be an excellent choice for students who are hungry during that time and have no other options on campus said Brokish PERIOD

According to Bill McGeorge director of Dining Services if the demand for the late night services is high students can expect the menu item list to expand PERIOD

Feedback is essential in maintaining upgrades in the dining services McGeorge welcomes all comments PERIOD
