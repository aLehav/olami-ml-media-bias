Some community members including Claire Garvais the communications and development coordinator at the Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network SBWCN are working to raise awareness and inform UCSB students about ways to help birds that fall out of their nests PERIOD

Hundreds of baby birds are expected to hatch across the UCSB campus PERIOD Sicheng Wang  Daily Nexus

Garvais graduated as a music major from UCSB in  and has since worked to help local animals in need PERIOD

Right around now early March is when we start getting hundreds of baby birds PERIOD Usually its about  baby animals in our care at a time PERIOD That can also be baby mammals like bunnies and squirrels and raccoons Garvais said PERIOD

Garvais explained that March  is the unofficial beginning of baby bird season when birds including mockingbirds towheess sparrows finches crows and seagulls begin to hatch from their nests PERIOD

She also emphasized the difference between birds in the hatchling nestling and fledgling stages of development as they should each be treated in a different way PERIOD

Hatchlings are straight out of the egg within the past couple days PERIOD Nestlings have a couple of feathers but are still mostly naked and are around a week old PERIOD Fledglings are fully feathered and they are almost ready to fly Garvais said PERIOD

If found on the ground hatchlings and nestlings should be returned to their nest if possible PERIOD However it is normal for fledglings leave the nest as they mature PERIOD

They do spend some time on the ground for a little while once they are fully feathered hopping around and learning how to fly PERIOD Thats normal PERIOD Their muscles are still developing for a couple of weeks Garvais said PERIOD

We are trying to instruct people not to kidnap animals that dont need to be saved PERIOD The best way for any baby to grow up is with their parents so if you see a baby the first instinct shouldnt be I need to get this out immediately it should be I need to call for help. baby birds are hatching all over UCSB Heres some helpful info in the event you find one PERIOD pic.twitter.comFc4g2GoLf8

Additionally Garvais encourages residents who own cats to put breakaway bell collars on them as doing so prevents them from hunting and injuring birds PERIOD Breakaway collars are safe PERIOD As soon as they are snagged they just break off so the cat cant get injured Garvais said PERIOD According to Garvais cats are the top danger to birds in the area injuring over  birds in the Santa Barbara area each year PERIOD

If a bird seems injured or orphaned or if the nestlings nest cannot be found Garvais encourages students to contact SBWCNs rescue hotline at   PERIOD

Once under the care of SBWCN the rescued animals will receive attentive support until they are ready to be released back into the wild PERIOD

For hummingbirds we feed them special nectar that we get from Denmark PERIOD Its specifically the best hummingbird nectar that you can get Garvais said PERIOD

Songbirds are fed a mixture of mealworms yogurt and vitamins that are blended together like a smoothie PERIOD They are fed by volunteers every  to  minutes PERIOD

Garvais hopes to debunk common misconceptions students may have about treating injured birds PERIOD

There are all these myths associated with baby birds that if you touch one then its parents wont be able to recognize it anymore PERIOD That is totally false PERIOD We dont recommend that people touch the animals more than they need to be but in order to renest a baby bird it can be put back Garvais said PERIOD

Garvais herself first learned about SBWCN when her friends brought an injured duck into her dorm room while she was living in San Miguel Hall PERIOD After a quick Google search she discovered SBWCN and decided to take the duck over PERIOD

I actually got an Uber and brought the bird to them PERIOD It was really cool to know that this resource exists Garvais said PERIOD

Unfortunately Garvais feels that many UCSB and Isla Vista residents dont know about SBWCN especially due to the constantly changing population of college students PERIOD Garvais hopes to raise awareness so that more animals are able to receive the help they need PERIOD

Just like how people save the CSO number in their phones we are hoping that people can save our helpline because you never know when you are going to find an animal in need Garvais said PERIOD
