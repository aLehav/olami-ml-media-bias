Researchers at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia and collaborating institutions have created an artificial womb that successfully aided lamb fetal development PERIOD This technology could eventually be applied to the development of premature human fetuses PERIOD The article published in the April  issue of Nature Communications outlines the researchers success in promoting normal brain and lung development of lamb fetuses in an artificial amniotic fluid closed circuit for the duration of a month PERIOD

The device closely mimics the composition of a natural womb consisting of a plastic bag and a synthetic umbilical cord interface PERIOD The developing fetus is kept in a dark warm environment and exposed to the sound of maternal sheep heartbeats to further imitate natural conditions PERIOD The artificial womb is pumped full of nutrients required for fetal development in quantities based on the natural development process mimicking the role of the placenta NPR.org PERIOD

This research is groundbreaking considering that external gestation processes have been attempted for more than  years but have yielded minimal success prior to this point Nature Communications PERIOD Jay Greenspan of Thomas Jefferson University labeled this study as a technological miracle that represents a huge step to try to do something that weve been trying to do for many years NPR.org PERIOD

Head researcher Alan Flake claims that their artificial womb technology will be ready for use in human trials within  to  years Science News PERIOD Approximately  babies are born earlier than  weeks premature each year and many of those babies die or acquire complications during the remaining developmental stages utilizing current technology NPR.org PERIOD Thus artificial wombs could prove to be an invaluable tool in improving quality of life for severely premature babies PERIOD

However there are potential complications and ethical boundaries associated with the use of artificial wombs for human development PERIOD The technology could function very differently when used for human fetuses as opposed to lamb fetuses and it automatically results in isolation of the fetus from the mother PERIOD Additionally the technology could cause undetected stress and subsequent damage to the fetus which might cancel out the lifesustaining benefits Nature Communications PERIOD

The concept of external gestation is shrouded in controversy as it begs the question what kind of artificial development qualifies as too artificial Dena Davis of Leigh University comments Up to now weve been either born or not born PERIOD This would be halfway born or something like that PERIOD Think about that in terms of our abortion politics NPR.org

While concerns about the ethics of this research are valid the future direction of the study aims only to improve developmental results for babies born past the 23week mark PERIOD The goal is not to replace the developmental role of the maternal womb but instead to provide a better transitional outlook for severely premature babies Science News PERIOD The future application of this study is promising and we will hopefully observe the efficacy of this technology as applied to humans in the coming years PERIOD
