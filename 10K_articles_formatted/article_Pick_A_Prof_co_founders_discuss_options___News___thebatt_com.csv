PickAProf cofounders Chris Chilek and John Cunningham participated in the Conference on Student Government Associations to discuss how student governments can make the Web sites service free for students PERIOD

 said Karen Bragg director of University Relations for PickAProf PERIOD

PickAProf www.pickaprof.com allows students to post professor reviews and rate professors based on their workloads lecture styles and exam types PERIOD The site also offers grade distributions for each instructor PERIOD

When Chilek and Cunningham both Class of  founded the site three years ago students could browse and post information for free PERIOD Accessing the PickAProf site now costs  a semester PERIOD

Texas AM students can purchase this membership from the AM Bookstore located in the Memorial Student Center and receive  back when they use the PickAProf site to reserve their textbooks online from participating local bookstores PERIOD But the service is free for students at universities such as the University of Maryland where the student government pays for the PickAProf service PERIOD

Bragg said some student governments pay the PickAProf fee for students while others add it to student fees PERIOD

Brooks Landgraf speaker of the AM Student Senate said no legislation pertaining to PickAProf is currently on its agenda and declined to comment on whether the senate would take up the issue in the future PERIOD

The Student Government Association offers a grade distribution system similar to PickaProf on its Web site sga.tamu.edu which allows students to view the breakdown of grades in any given course by professors from as far back as1985 Landgraf said

This service is free of charge but lacks student reviews PERIOD

 said Anna Hollier a sophomore finance major PERIOD

According to feedback from panels of students in focus groups the student reviews posted on PickAProf are what keep users coming back to the site Bragg said PERIOD

PickAProf also offers a new service called Professor Support System which allows professors to post their syllabi and biographical information on the site prior to registration PERIOD Professors can use this feature to make their own course evaluations PERIOD

Associate professor of English Paula Matthews said while the information should be available to students she would have mixed feelings about participating in the Professor Support System

 Matthews said PERIOD

Matthews said she supports full disclosure of information to students admitting that she looked herself up on the PickAProf Web site when it first began PERIOD But she said the site would work best if everyerson in a class wrote a review PERIOD

The PickAProf service began as a pilot program at AM and the University of Texas at Austin and is now utilized on more than  campuses nationwide PERIOD
