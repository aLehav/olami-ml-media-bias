No attached price tags PERIOD No prior knowledge of a programming language required PERIOD Simple enough to learn in under an hour PERIOD Many gamers are less familiar with Twine than game creation programs bigbudget studios use like Unity or the Unreal Engine but this landmark freeware is special in that it makes gamemaking simpler than it has ever been before PERIOD Following Twines  release anybody could quickly make a computer game about anything they wanted and share it PERIOD Twines indie games have boomed from few in number to countless meeting both high praise and intense backlash along the way PERIOD What should count as a video game Moreover who should be allowed to make them



University of Utah associate professor Elizabeth Swanstrom works in the English Department and the Marriott Librarys Digital Matters program PERIOD She specializes in digital humanities an umbrella term for a field which she said is notoriously impossible to define but said if youre using a computer as a fundamental part of what youre doing or making youre in it. alongside many other pieces of software Swanstrom teaches Twine PERIOD Its ideal for introducing students who arent computer science or EAE majors to game mechanics and electronic literature PERIOD Its just so much more friendly than other operating systems she said PERIOD

Twine is a tool for writing textbased games PERIOD To begin a user opens a page adds text and then makes a hyperlink that creates the next page PERIOD For example a barebones Twine game might display the prompt Your cat is hungry with two clickable options Feed the cat and Dont feed the cat. each may then lead to a result The cat lives or The cat dies. this is about as minimalist as a video game can get with just one choice for a player to make and two possible outcomes PERIOD Enough choices strung together though make for a game with many endings PERIOD

My favorite book of all time is still Underground Kingdom by Edward Packard which is a Choose Your Own Adventure novel Swanstrom said PERIOD And the use of Twine makes building that kind of narrative as easy as possible in ways that I dont think have been replicated with other programs. twine lets its creators do more than write branching stories with text alone by including animations sounds pictures and code into their games as they become more practiced PERIOD It can handle conditional statements it can handle anything you can make in Python PERIOD Its pretty flexible and there are several active community boards you can go to if you get stuck said Swanstrom PERIOD I was checking up with a grad student last week to make sure that they could embed Google Maps into a Twine game and you know you can



One can expect to see books movies and television that tackle serious topics such as mental illness and suicide headon but what about a computer game Enter Depression Quest. when this Twinebased simulator went up on Steam in  its reception was intensely polarized PERIOD Although many gamers enjoyed the more serious game others were insulted by the idea of a computer game that solemnly discussed mental health in depth PERIOD Depression Quest designer Zo Quinn temporarily pulled the game from Steam after being falsely accused of having a relationship with a journalist who wrote a positive review and receivingso many anonymous death and rape threats that she temporarily had to live in hiding PERIOD Her attackers also started the online harassment campaign GamerGate off of Reddit and 4chan targeting artists that its members felt were promoting progressivism feminism diversity and political agendas in gaming culture PERIOD It has inspired other movements like it and actively runs online today PERIOD Its so amazing to me that that ever became a thing Swanstrom said about GamerGate PERIOD Its puzzling to me. maybe ten years ago maybe twelve now there came a big debate in the humanities an antidigital narrative throw down Swanstrom said PERIOD While GamerGate and the debates surrounding it are still prevalent in the gaming world there also exists a tendency for academics to dismiss gaming as a legitimate literary form PERIOD One of the criticisms about experimental literature or digitally born works of art is that they are more interesting formally than they are to engage with she said PERIOD Theyre more fun to think about than interact with. indie creators Twine games continue to challenge both mainstream gaming and literature in featuring many slices of life with marginalized and controversial subjects at their centers PERIOD Swanstrom sees this trend as one of Twines advantages PERIOD It is free and it doesnt have to go through commercial standards and so this means you see topics that wouldnt be considered quote on quote fun sexy or profitable she said PERIOD For every shooter and terrain explorer out there there seems to be a Twine game about issues such as sexism disability racism or familial abuse PERIOD That anyone can make a real game communicate things according to their intuition I think thats fantastic said Swanstrom PERIOD



Ranging from simple text games to complex narratives reliant on graphics and music Twine games dont only broach differing themes but vastly different looks and aesthetics PERIOD One of Swanstroms favorite Twine games is one of those more minimalist in terms of visual design a text game PERIOD In my upperlevel digital humanities grad seminar we look at Porpentines With Those We Love Alive she said PERIOD And I think it is really gorgeous. swanstrom likes to present it to her students to show them that they can build strong games with few complex multimedia elements PERIOD I love that it starts out just kind of like Alright anyone could do this and I think for the most part the structure is pretty friendly. porpentine is one of Twines most wellknown and popular makers PERIOD Her games are simultaneously recognizable by their bright neon colors and the strange extremity that their narratives take on PERIOD In an interview with the New York Times Porpentine reflected on how her games were influenced by her experience of being forced from her home after coming out as transgender PERIOD A lot of my work deals with these topics of abuse that I feel are incredibly common to any feminine persons life she said PERIOD With Those We Love Alive deals with such themes in an outofthebox way by asking its players to draw on themselves alongside the story PERIOD Some of us when we went through the class had taken tons of notes and some of us had actually written on our skin said Swanstrom PERIOD I like that its different for everyone who plays it. other wellreceived Twine games also stand out as unique offerings from the indie gaming world PERIOD my fathers long long legs a horror game evocative of creepypasta lore maintains a uniquely eerie misty atmosphere as does Bogeyman an original fairytale about what happens to naughty children who disappear PERIOD Some Twine games are built to resemble retro pixel games such as the dystopian Horse Master and comedic do not forget. still others in particular are especially enjoyable for their clever artwork like The Temple of No and rs. i think people are just learning to explore the capabilities of Twine Swanstrom said PERIOD She encourages those who havent used it before to give the software a try PERIOD I would love to see more people start blurring those boundaries between fiction and gaming and narration she said PERIOD

Twine is free to use both online and for download PERIOD
