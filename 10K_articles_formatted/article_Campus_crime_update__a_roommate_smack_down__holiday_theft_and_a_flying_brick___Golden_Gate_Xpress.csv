1461,2023-11-04,"heres an update on campus crimes that occurred between November  and December  PERIOD

Tis the Season to be an Ahole

This years Black Friday shopathon consisted of doorbusting sales around the U.S PERIOD and an incident where one woman peppersprayed a fellow shopper to nab a Microsoft Xbox  presumably because playing Dance Central  is more valuable than that persons eyesight PERIOD However news networks missed the true shopping deal this year breaking into peoples stuff PERIOD A student reported  worth of possessions were stolen from her Creative Arts locker over Thanksgiving Break including her awesome guitar PERIOD And then there were two reports of cars that had been broken into last week between Thursday and Friday PERIOD The first incident was a students car parked on Tapia Drive and the second was a Universityowned vehicle parked on Buckingham Way PERIOD Why play Forza Motorsport on an Xbox  when one can drive a stolen vehicle Or why play Rock Band when using a real guitar is just as fun Happy holidays jerks

Rudolph the RedNosed Roommate

Back on the 90s Rock Em Sock Em Robots were the all the rage PERIOD Beating up your neighbors blue bot with your red bot made settling the Biggie and Tupac beef much easier PERIOD Then Socker Boppers came onto the scene and allowed anyone to punch others silly with superinflated beach balls fastened as boxing gloves PERIOD The 90s were painful but fun as hell PERIOD So in that spirit two roommates threw the 90s toys out altogether and had good oldfashioned fisticuffs at their Buckingham Way apartment November  PERIOD An officer arrived to settle the dispute and had one of the roommates leave for the evening to settle down PERIOD The cause of the altercation was uncertain but hopefully theyll resolve their disputes using stuff from their toy box PERIOD

Merry Brickmas Everybody

One person really wanted to replicate the snowball fight from Elf with Will Ferrell November  but no snow was to be found at SF State Forlorn he wandered the campus until behold he saw a mortar rectangle lying on the ground PERIOD Its red surface invoked the holiday season and his mind filled with memories of warm pies family fun and christmas lights everywhere PERIOD Inspired he lifted this brick imagined it as a snowball made from a fresh snowfall and threw it auspiciously into the air as a sign of his own upward success PERIOD The bricknothis beacon would represent his hopes and dreams and everything Christmas means to him PERIOD And though still without snow he smiled knowing that freshman year was going to be all right PERIOD Then the brick broke a window near Mary Ward Hall and he ran PERIOD Police made a report PERIOD
