Dressed in a fitted red dress heels and warm pink eyeshadow swept over her eyelids Jaalah Evans prepares to leave her dorm for a Valentines Day steak dinner PERIOD However there wont be a significant other at the table because the night is dedicated to her friends PERIOD

On a day filled with Instagram posts of people in relationships celebrating their partners or going on romantic dates those without partners may choose to make Palentines or Galentines Day plans  others may ignore the holiday entirely PERIOD

Evans and Gabrielle Adekogbe both freshmen at the University of Georgia took the day into their own hands by making Galentines plans PERIOD Adekogbe said the motivating factor in celebrating this was to avoid sitting in the house all day PERIOD Along with two other friends they will dress up in coordinating outfits and enjoy a steak dinner together PERIOD

We just wanted to feel good and enjoy ourselves Adekogbe said PERIOD

Rather than a day solely focused on loving a significant other Evans and Adekogbe have a different take on what Valentines Day means PERIOD

Its a day to be grateful for the love that you do have and not think about the love that you dont have or desire Evans said PERIOD

In elementary school Valentines Day was often spent handing out Sweethearts branded with words such as Be mine and I love you and other candies to peers PERIOD In college students may feel an extra weight on the holiday as it has turned into more than receiving candy grams PERIOD

Many feel the pressure to have a date in order to celebrate the holiday PERIOD This expectation has led to some people deciding instead to celebrate the day after Valentines Day otherwise known as Single Awareness Day. pERIOD

People can have two opposing opinions about Valentines Day PERIOD You either say Oh I love Valentines Day because I can spend it with my significant other or I really dont like it because it reminds me that I dont have a significant other Perez said PERIOD Either way were giving these cyclists the chance to just celebrate themselves or celebrate their friends. a small group of people gathered outside of the North Oconee Water Reclamation Facility on Sunday afternoon for a free Valentines Daythemed tour of the facility PERIOD
