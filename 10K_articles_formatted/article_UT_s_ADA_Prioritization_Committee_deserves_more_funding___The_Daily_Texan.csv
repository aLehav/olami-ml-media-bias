In  the Americans with Disabilities Act established construction standards for physical accessibility PERIOD However because many of UTs buildings were built before  they fail to meet these standards PERIOD

While UT has made an effort to bring buildings into ADA compliance through action items such as the  ADA Title II Transition Plan it still has a long way to go PERIOD With financial limitations campuswide progress and renovation is slow PERIOD To make further progress with campus accessibility issues the University should allocate additional funding to the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement or DDCE PERIOD

However budgeting depends on the ADA Prioritization Committee which is chaired by Project Management and Construction Services PERIOD The committee made up of faculty students and staff meets quarterly to prioritize which projects happen on the UT campus PERIOD

Neuroscience senior Shubhi Nanda an ADA Prioritization Committee member described some of the accessibility challenges shes heard of PERIOD

Ive definitely heard the stories where some of my friends with physical disabilities had to drop a class because they couldnt get to their classroom Nanda said PERIOD

Students with physical disabilities deserve to take the classes they want to take without any outside interference PERIOD

If people are not able to attend their classrooms  and theyre not given the same opportunity as other students then theyre not going to be able to succeed and theyre going to be put at a disadvantage said Madyson Mireles a sociology sophomore and codirector for UT Student Governments diversity and inclusion agency PERIOD I just feel like its not allowing people to succeed. jennifer Maedgen senior associate vice president and chief of staff of the DDCE said the University allocates . million dollars each year to campus accessibility projects PERIOD According to the ADA Transition Plan it will take  million to address all campus accessibility needs PERIOD Currently the ADA Prioritization Committee is prioritizing paths of travel next theyll focus on general building accessibility PERIOD

The ADA Prioritization Committee has tried to use their allocated . million dollars for the transition plan PERIOD However theyre often forced to address urgent needs first such as renovations that require UT to make a building ADA compliant outside of the transition plans agenda items PERIOD This is often an expensive distraction which forces the committee to be strategic with their limited funds PERIOD

The ADA Prioritization Committee is already working above and beyond ADA compliances to create a more accessible and inclusive campus but they deserve more support from UT PERIOD

Where is the committee funding on their list  Even if . million might seem like a lot what is it in comparison to their priorities like our athletics department Mireles said PERIOD

Students with physical disabilities deserve to have an equitable campus not one with inherent obstacles that interfere with their access to education PERIOD The University must prioritize students with disabilities and their needs through proper funding PERIOD Such funding dedicated to increasing access and inclusion on campus should be raised in order to accommodate both issues that arise but also what the community wants PERIOD

If they have to fight so hard for the basic needs of students to go to class then the funding is not where it needs to be Mireles said PERIOD

Muthukrishnan is a government freshman from Los Gatos California PERIOD
