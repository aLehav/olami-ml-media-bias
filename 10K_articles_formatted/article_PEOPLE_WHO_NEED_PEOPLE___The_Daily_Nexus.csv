The first part of the final show for UCSBs Honors Art Program People Who Need People recently finished its run in Gallery  PERIOD The exhibition lasted from April  through  and featured work by Melissa Chhan Raymond Douglas Rosana Liang Olenka Malarecka and Tessa Tapscott who make up one half of the  Honors Art students PERIOD
According to Douglas the shows title People Who Need People spoke to the functionality of each artists work and art in general as everything on display required interaction from the viewer in some way PERIOD Liang added that the title also is a reflection of the relationship between artists praising the collaborative community of the Honors Program in particular PERIOD
Chhans display was hard to miss when walking into the gallery a large installation of two striped awnings that transformed the space into a quaint Mom and Pop store PERIOD Chhan also applied handpainted signage directly to the walls above a red frieze that told a story what she describes as stream of consciousness thoughts I had while walking around an urban landscape. the installations style recalls Chhans earlier printmaking and typography work which is colorful and nostalgic PERIOD
My family owns a little donut shop in L.A PERIOD and thats influenced a lot of what I do and see because its been a huge part of my life Chhan said PERIOD
The largescale project is even more impressive because Chhan broke her foot shortly before the install PERIOD She was especially grateful for the supportive and motivating environment her fellow artists provided while she was on crutches and in a wheelchair PERIOD Somehow she still completed her work painting along the top of the gallery walls which is quite a feat in itself PERIOD
Although the night was a culmination of work and conversations that occurred throughout the year Douglas admitted that he did not show pieces begun in fall at least not in the material sense PERIOD Instead he started and stopped certain projects switching direction and changing emphasis PERIOD Though he did not work on just one idea he says that his early works allowed him to strengthen the core values of his art which manifested themselves in his final exhibited pieces PERIOD
Among them was a work titled Dimlit Divot where the viewer would flip a switch and peer down into a box through a peephole to see an illuminated grassy surface surrounded by darkness PERIOD
The black void remains unlit with the switch off and with the switch on Douglas said PERIOD It reminds us that there is always more to unearth. his other pieces were equally functional and industriallooking showcasing raw materials and changing landscapes PERIOD He describes his body of work in this show as a tool to aid people in seeing and experiencing hidden qualities of our world. liangs three digitallyinspired pieces provided a change of pace in the gallery PERIOD In the first titled Fragments of Yesterday Liang layered three holographic Google street images of Isla Vista PERIOD She describes the piece as representative of our perception of time and travel mimicking static fragments of memory. another piece was made up of four different photographs on light boxes each showing an ice cube slowly melting into water PERIOD With this work Liang hoped to illuminate the transitory nature of time and the beauty in fleeting moments. liangs work also calls attention to the idea of the part and the whole it is hard to separate the fragments of her work from its cohesive result PERIOD Furthermore by utilizing digital techniques like a scanner to capture the ice cubes Liangs art is fiercely grounded in the contemporary allowing viewers to contemplate her ideas within the world around them PERIOD
Keeping with the shows theme of interaction Malareckas two displays required a very attentive viewer PERIOD The first was an animation of an office building projected on a pedestal PERIOD When the viewer looked closer they could see people inside the office moving around which Malarecka says stemmed from her interest in routine. the extreme detail and moving parts in the piece were incredibly fascinating successfully drawing in and holding the attention of viewers PERIOD She also displayed an interactive puzzle where the viewer used tangramlike shapes to build a house PERIOD
The purpose of the work was to teach basic philosophical concepts via simple childlike games Malarecka said PERIOD Both projects reflect Malareckas diverse artistic style which she says switched from painting to digital design in her first year as a CCS art student PERIOD
Tapscott had two pieces in the show PERIOD The first was a trio of small coffins created to reflect the shapes of a dog a cat and a horse which were stuffed with fur PERIOD
The piece was about how humans view their own mortality through the lives of their pets Tapscott said PERIOD
The other display which she called an installation and performance piece in one took up much of the gallerys second room PERIOD Tapscott constructed a fullsized horse paddock and resided in it for an hour each day of the show PERIOD For this performance Tapscott fully adopted the personality of her reallife horse allowing people to interact with her as though she were the actual animal PERIOD She described the feeling as a strange kind of vulnerability that I had never experienced before. when asked why she wanted to do it Tapscott said she had wondered what it would be like to be completely at someones will in that way that a horse is at all times. although she admitted to feeling stressed about both pieces Tapscott was ultimately very happy with her work and her many positive reviews prove that the audience was as well PERIOD
The gallery held a closing reception on the night of April  where friends and family members gathered with the artists PERIOD An atmosphere of accomplishment and joy permeated the evening which was a culmination of sorts for each student PERIOD Huddled along every wall and in every corner of Gallery  people were eagerly asking questions of and listening to explanations from the artists PERIOD Fondly remembering the night Douglas said I partook in some of the most satisfying and important conversations of my education. every other student I talked to echoed his high praise of the exhibition and extended much gratitude to the Honors program in general PERIOD
I cant imagine it not being a part of my college experience Chhan said PERIOD
The first five students to show and their peers certainly have faculty to thank for the push that Honors provided them PERIOD Notable mentors include Professor Jane Mulfinger and Professor Laurel Beckman who led the Fall and Winter Quarter Honors Seminars respectively PERIOD But its clear that they also have helped each other quite a lot along the way PERIOD People Who Need People true to its name was a success in their eyes and mine PERIOD



PART II

If you are like me you like finding secret nooks and crannies of awesomeness on our dear college campus PERIOD The plentiful art shows are becoming one of my new favorite outlets for this awesomeness PERIOD

On April  the Honors Art Program hosted a reception for the second part of its annual show which ran from April  to  PERIOD People Who Need People featured work by Jack Aldrich Demi Anter Alex Givens Megan Ogle and Emerald VernonLapow PERIOD It was also the inaugural show for the newly renovated Arts Buildings gallery a brand spankin new art hub located close to the Art Design  Architecture Museum PERIOD

Having never been to a UCSB art show before I didnt quite know what to expect PERIOD Sure Ive loitered around my fair share of art museums and am mildly obsessed with the Getty in L.A. but art shows produced by for and with peers was new territory PERIOD

The space was pristine PERIOD White walls with piping crisscrossing the ceiling created a clean industrial feel PERIOD The gallery comprised of a mediumsized glass box room attached to a larger walledin room was open and airy with just enough Two Buck Chuckinfused conversation to provide a cheery atmosphere PERIOD

VernonLapow created a series of collages marked by simple gorgeous geometric forms and intertwining the human body with machinery PERIOD The sparse imagery seemed to be inspired by mythology PERIOD The collages were made from clippings of old National Geographic magazines some of which dated back to the first decade of the 1900s PERIOD VernonLapow has been collecting magazines from church sales and thrift shops for the last  years PERIOD

What I love about Emeralds work is that there is an entire iceberg of feeling in between the sparseness of the collage said fourthyear CCS literature student Alison Green PERIOD Im used to collaging being so clustered but she uses such little space  its fun to try to unravel her mental process as she was doing this figuring out which images connect people together and what would get the right emotional reaction. givens went a more technologyinfused route PERIOD One of his three pieces involved a book used as an interface PERIOD The analogueprinted book plugged into a Mac computer and showed the viewer different imagery onscreen when each page was flipped PERIOD The piece dealt with invasive technologies like viruses by linking how they destroy computers to organic animal forms in the book PERIOD

Another source of invasion was Givens 3D point cloud images of viewers that stood in front of a Kinect which fed their shapes into a computer program and projected them onto the wall in a slightly abstracted manner PERIOD Givens explained that the piece was about how increasingly vulnerable someones data  down to their actual physical shape in space  is in our world of rapidly growing technology PERIOD

Aldrichs works were much more in the realm of handcrafted objects PERIOD How to Follow an Albatross was a visualization of a conceptual issue Aldrich came across albatross used as a metaphor in a music review It was an albatross he could not follow. not being familiar with the metaphor he thought about the literal difficulties of following the large bird and created his piece as a model and monument to the process PERIOD A wooden pedestal was topped with a globe made of wood with metal scraps nailed in place as the continents next to a metal bird in flight PERIOD

Aldrichs piece looked like something you would find in Aristotles office only slightly unfinished PERIOD A gear mechanism also completely built by the artist allowed viewers to rotate the globe by pressing a pedal but the globe moved in a jerky unstable manner PERIOD However when viewed alongside his other pieces  a series of scrappy sculptures topped with an orange tape flag marked by the word Sorry in sharpie and a video piece called Holding a Handful of Water which depicted a spiffilydressed Aldrich trying to do just that using objects ranging from his hands to a toilet plunger to a canoe PERIOD It became clear that this jenkiness was an intended quality PERIOD All of his pieces worked together to send a message about the futility of human endeavors artmaking perhaps being one of them PERIOD But this actually made the pieces and their shortcomings quite charming and memorable PERIOD

Anter built structures that fostered intimacy PERIOD One was a  footlong forest green box that was mounted to one wall and emitted light from several peep holes evenly spaced and centered PERIOD Upon closer inspection I realized that there were text and images inside the box which could be read through the holes PERIOD The original story titled Otto the Cat was quirky and a little bizarre it was essentially about a cat that kills a bird PERIOD But Otto is not your average catas seen in lines like Otto the cat made the best impersonations PERIOD In fact if Otto took the time to impersonate a particular facial expression of yours you knew you were in. in the end the story is about our desire to make animals and people be something that they are not its about loving a thing that might disappoint or disgust you despite your greatest efforts PERIOD

The spacing of the text made viewers aware of their proximity to each other every time they moved down the row to continue the story stuffing their faces close to the box and bumping shoulders providing the effect of peeking into someones secret life PERIOD Anters piece Whenever you breathe out Im breathing in also dealt with space interactivity and intimacy PERIOD Two floating lengths of fabric hung parallel to each other about shoulder width apart PERIOD People could walk through them and be immersed by the small environment they created within the larger space of the gallery PERIOD On the insides of the fabric were large reddish splotches illuminated by two bare hanging light bulbs that cast a warm light inside the fabric and created shadows of viewers visible on the outside PERIOD Anter explained that the imagery was drawn from her and her boyfriends relationship PERIOD

My boyfriend has psoriasis which causes these red patches on his skin PERIOD People are obviously very selfconscious about skin issues even the smallest pimple so thats been hard for him to deal with at times said Anter PERIOD But I love him and his skin  I think its beautiful PERIOD I wanted to abstract it by blowing it up turning it into this visual element that wasnt immediately recognizable and put my skin on the opposite fabric PERIOD I hope people who walk through it will feel comforted by the closeness of the space and will also see the pattern  the skin  as beautiful. undeniable Connections by Ogle a maze of hundreds of neon pink orange purple and yellowishgreen strings was probably the most monumental of the pieces in the show PERIOD Each string was carefully placed so that not one of them would touch no matter how close they were PERIOD They explored tension and it turns out that they were placed to loosely reflect the twists and turns of one of Ogles friendships PERIOD

I think Ogles work was about the reality of how we as humans are always just barely passing others by when we could be making important connections said Green PERIOD

The neatest thing about this show was just how different art can be for different people PERIOD Each student had to plan out and propose what they wanted to create for the show and the executions were distinctly varied PERIOD There was the classic collage the hightech intertwining of interface and books the woodworking construction immersive fabric and text and a whirling maze of vibrant strings but they somehow meshed together leading viewers from one piece to another and creating a final cohesive sense of community connection human ability and human shortcomings PERIOD

People Who Need People was a nook that I was immensely glad to have stumbled upon that Thursday night PERIOD Congratulations to the second group of this years Honors students for creating an engaging show PERIOD
