A Message from Debbie Smiloff De Louise
Pioneer Class of 

I was a writer features editor and secretary on The Pioneer from  until I graduated C.W PERIOD Post in  PERIOD I came to Post as a slightly older student who returned to college after working a year as a secretary PERIOD I enrolled parttime as an English major to test the waters before I made the fulltime commitment PERIOD

One of the first things I did was trying to find a way to become involved on campus PERIOD I remember walking down the second floor corridor of Hillwood Commons to the activity wing where The Pioneer newspaper office was located PERIOD Adam Pardonek the EditorinChief at that time spoke to me in his office about my interests in working for the student newspaper PERIOD I explained my situation as a new student who had prior experience as a secretary and also enjoyed writing PERIOD He suggested that my skills could be put to good use because many of the writers and editors needed help having their stories typed PERIOD There was also an opening for a features writer on that years paper PERIOD I accepted both positions PERIOD

My parttime job as secretary was approved by the administration and I was paid a small wage PERIOD The workload sometimes became intense especially close to deadlines PERIOD At that time I used WordPerfect to input the stories into a computer PERIOD Unlike todays technology the papers layout was done inhouse in a production room and brought to a printer for copying PERIOD My memories of production night dinners on Wednesdays are still clear after all these years PERIOD The advertising manager had an agreement with the local Fireside restaurant where the editors could have dinner each week in exchange for advertising copy in the paper PERIOD We all looked forward to these meals PERIOD Thinking back about eating with the editors as we discussed our stories I can still taste the fried mozzarella sticks and recall the camaraderie and some of the jokes that were told PERIOD We celebrated staff birthdays and other occasions too PERIOD

I still have my desk plaque that reads Debbie Smiloff and fond memories of my time on the Pioneer PERIOD I also received a special award for my feature writing my first year on the paper the Lawrence C PERIOD Lobaugh jr PERIOD Memorial Award in Journalism PERIOD Along with a plaque that is displayed in the Admissions building I was given an engraved medal PERIOD The award had been given in memory of a man whose son had worked on the Pioneer and died much too young PERIOD It was quite an honor to receive this award and I have treasured the medal for  years PERIOD

I saw many editorinchiefs come and go after Adam who graduated that year PERIOD I moved up to features editor and was in charge of that section and the group of writers who contributed articles for it PERIOD I worked for Tim Votapka Janice De Freitas Valerie Kellogg and Raymond Jasen and I also came to know the other staff members editors and writers PERIOD Through my interviews for feature articles I also met professors studentsand school administrators PERIOD The experience I gained from working on the paper led me to publishing articles in magazines and after I married I published a few books as well PERIOD

My first published novel Cloudy Rainbow actually features some chapters that take place at The Pioneer PERIOD My current book A Stones Throw includes a librarian like myself who is a Post graduate from the Palmer School PERIOD One of the books settings is in Brookville where C.W PERIOD Post is located PERIOD

Many people say that college is the best years of ones life PERIOD I agree PERIOD Even though classes can be tough and there are many additional stresses as one faces impending adulthood the opportunity for friendships and extracurricular experiences such as those I gained from The Pioneer cannot be duplicated PERIOD I look back on those days and the person I once was and realize how much my participation at the paper made a difference in my life PERIOD

I am also happy that as the Internet and social media have developed ways of staying in touch I have been able to reconnect with some of my fellow Pioneer friends PERIOD Over the summer I did a book signing at the Levittown Library and was pleasantly surprised when Mike Gannon a previous Sports Editor on The Pioneer dropped by PERIOD He saw my Facebook post about the event and wanted to surprise me PERIOD It was the highlight of my day PERIOD

I believe the bond formed among Pioneer alumni remains strong despite time and distance because of the special experiences we shared on the paper PERIOD Not all the times were happy or fun but we were all in them together PERIOD We worked to create a product that served the entire campus body PERIOD We were proud of our individual achievements but also realized it was a team effort PERIOD
