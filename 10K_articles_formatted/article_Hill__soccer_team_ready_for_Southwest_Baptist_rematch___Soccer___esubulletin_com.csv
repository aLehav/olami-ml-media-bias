Updated November     pm



The Emporia State Soccer team has spent the first third of their season on the road facing opponents on unfamiliar ground PERIOD Theyre looking forward to a homecoming today versus Southwest Baptist at  p.m PERIOD and a chance to turn their season around PERIOD

The road trip hasnt been kind to the Lady Hornets PERIOD During the monthlong road trip the soccer team is  with one tie PERIOD The lone win came against Missouri Southern with the Hornets winning  in a tight MIAA battle PERIOD The players are feeling the effects  yet theyre not the only ones PERIOD

Im happy that for the first time in four weeks Im not spending my time preparing for the road said Jim Schneiderhahn head coach of the soccer team PERIOD The hardest thing is getting all  players the equipment and myself at one place and ready for a game PERIOD I know the girls are excited to play at home and I hope that were able to channel that excitement into some activity when we kickoff on Thursday. the Southwest Baptist Bearcats are a team that the Hornets faced and lost to  earlier this season PERIOD The team looks to change the outcome this time around using home field advantage the best that they can PERIOD

We just saw SBU two weeks ago  its always difficult to play teams twice Schneiderhahn said PERIOD We lost the first game  and we made a few physical errors PERIOD We didnt see the work rate we need to see out of some players PERIOD This is a team we can match up with pretty well PERIOD They play a very hard game and they have some very savvy kids up top that can create for themselves. ashley Hill freshman secondary education major is the leading scorer for the Lady Hornets with three goals on the season PERIOD Hill said she is extremely excited to play in her first collegiate home game  she will be looking to add to those goal totals and hopes winning this game will give ESU Soccer what it need to turn this season around PERIOD

We need to come out ready to play and play to our full ability Hill said PERIOD I think if we can win this game it will give us the confidence to beat other teams this season. the Hornets will need to exploit every advantage they have to defeat a Southwest Baptist team that is  PERIOD Amanda Miano senior math education major knows what it will to take to come away with a W PERIOD

Theyre really good in the middle they win every  ball and they can shoot the ball well Miano said PERIOD Were looking to take players on and we need to win more balls in the middle. the team has had difficulty putting the ball into the net this season only scoring four goals in seven games PERIOD Schneiderhahn hopes that his game day strategy will be enough to produce goals PERIOD

We need the forwards to create space and create runs for themselves off the ball and we need the midfielders to get the ball there  they both need to step it up Schneiderhahn said PERIOD Our wing midfielders need to step it up particularly on the attacking end PERIOD Theyre doing great defensively but were not getting any punch from them on the attacking end of the ball PERIOD Our forwards need to be a little more dynamic up front PERIOD They need to be willing to risk a little bit more. austin WagonerThe Bulletin PERIOD
