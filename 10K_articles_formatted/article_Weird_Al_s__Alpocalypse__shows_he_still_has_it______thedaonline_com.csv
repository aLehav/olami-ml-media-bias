Weird Al has always been a fact of life for me PERIOD

Every couple of years the curlyhaired mocker releases a new album and ever since Ive had an allowance of my own Ive made buying his albums a priority PERIOD

His latest release  may not be perfect but there is still plenty of parody goodness for fans to enjoy PERIOD

 features  songs five of which were released on Als  EP  and seven new titles with the whole album full of the sort of songs longtime fans would expect PERIOD

One of the more entertaining tracks is titled  a parody of Taylor Swifts  which not only does the original song justice but also wonderfully mocks celebrity gossip company TMZ PERIOD

Besides Swift other parodied bands include B.o.B the White Stripes and T.I PERIOD Although only about half of the songs parody a specific title from these artists the rest of them pulling multiple elements artists are known for PERIOD

 which was originally released on  is another shining light of entertainment as it not only features a

strong representation of the White Stripes style but

also elevates camp actor Charles Nelson Reilly to Chuck Norrislevels of manliness PERIOD

In some instances Al actually seems to have made a song that is better than the original PERIOD His version of Lady Gagas  titled  actually has more creative lyrics although the music video can cause nightmares PERIOD

Unfortunatelynot every song is up to Als usual caliber PERIOD

This albums polka parody  has a bit of a weak start and although it soon gets better it still isnt as entertaining the polka medleys featured on past albums PERIOD

Also his Miley Cyrus parody  just seems kind of unoriginal as songs go as if it was only added to the album as an afterthought and with more time could have been something better PERIOD

 another song originally from  is a great parody of The Doors style but isnt exactly topical and fills me with worry that Als younger fans simply wont get it PERIOD

While in the past I have gone out of my way to always purchase Weird Als CDs this time around I couldnt resist picking up the album on iTunes as it comes with  music videos as well an impressive amount considering there are only  songs PERIOD

For those who already love Als music this album is a smart purchase and it does a solid job giving new fans an idea of what the artists work is typically like PERIOD

I just wish there was a new Star Wars parody PERIOD
