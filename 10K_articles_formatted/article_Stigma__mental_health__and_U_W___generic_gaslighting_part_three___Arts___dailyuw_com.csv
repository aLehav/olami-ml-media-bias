Updated November     pm



In the first article in this series I described my negative experiences with a generic form of the brand name ADHD drug Concerta or extendedrelease methylphenidate hydrochloride made by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals and my doctors revelation that Federal Drug Administration FDA no longer considered said generic to be functionally equivalent to name brand PERIOD

Before I could understand how I ended up taking medication that did not do what I was led to expect I needed to understand the difference between the two pills PERIOD This led me to my second article where Dr PERIOD Mark Stein helped explain the mechanics behind Concertas extendedrelease technology and why the generic effects were not the same despite having the same active ingredient PERIOD

Which brings us to this third article the story of how a therapeutically inequivalent generic medication won the FDAs approval and the bureaucracy involved in fixing that mistake PERIOD All the information presented here has been taken directly from the FDAs public records regarding Mallinckrodts generic PERIOD

Concerta as part of the established New Drug Application NDA process underwent almost a decade of extensive preclinical and clinical trials with hundreds of subjects to verify that it was safe and effective before it received FDA approval in  PERIOD Generic drugs in contrast arent required to go through the same extensive testing PERIOD

The Abbreviated New Drug Application ANDA for generics only requires that manufacturers prove scientifically that the new medication is bioequivalent has the same effect to the original PERIOD According to the FDA that usually means one trial of about  volunteers where efficacy is judged by how long it takes for the active ingredient to reach the bloodstream PERIOD The FDAs general rule for acceptable bioequivalence is a generic drug that delivers the same amount of active ingredient in the same amount of time as the name brand PERIOD

The problem with the ANDA approval process in the case of Concerta was that the FDAs general definition of bioequivalence did not account for the medications unprecedented extendedrelease mechanic PERIOD Earlier extendedrelease technology had two basic actions one quickrelease dose followed by a second slower dose that releases evenly over time PERIOD

Concerta has the same initial quickrelease dose but the second dose is actually two doses designed to ramp up slowly over an  hour period PERIOD The manufacturer Johnson  Johnson Pharmaceuticals recognized that the traditional benchmarks would be insufficient and made several attempts in  and  to get the FDA to update their metrics PERIOD

In a letter dated July   the FDA acknowledged its concerns and made limited adjustments accordingly PERIOD The first official set of bioequivalence recommendations were published in September  PERIOD Mallinckrodts generic was approved in December  and Kudcos now Kremers Urban in July  both designed specifically to meet those benchmarks PERIOD

Immediately the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System FAERS saw a spike in complaints about the new generics all indicating they were not as effective as the medications they replaced PERIOD These numberscombined with feedback from professionals like Dr PERIOD Stein from part two of this serieswere enough to prompt the FDA to review the ANDA for both pills PERIOD

In November  after reviewing all of the available data theFDA determined that there was enough evidence to put the generics bioequivalence in doubt.The agency updated its benchmark recommendations to account for the discrepancy PERIOD Then it downgraded the official therapeutic equivalence of the Mallinckrodt and Kudco products in its Orange Bookfrom BA to BX indicating they should no longer be considered automatic substitutes for the name brand PERIOD

At the same time the FDA gave the manufacturers the choice to either voluntarily withdraw their drugs from the market or submit proof that they meet the new recommended standards within six months PERIOD Neither chose to withdraw PERIOD Mallinckrodt went on the offensive defending its product by filing petitionsthat suggested there was not enough evidence to support the ANDA standards needed to be updated PERIOD

Almost two years later in October  the FDA finally announced a proposal to withdraw approvalfor Mallinckrodts generic PERIOD Mallinckrodt has requested a hearing and an extension which keeps the case open PERIOD Until the approval is withdrawn the product can still be legally sold by pharmacies in the U.S PERIOD

The early uncertainty in the FDA on how best to evaluate copies of a new drug whose exact functioning is protected by copyright explains how a generic like Mallinckrodts can get approved PERIOD The slow pace of government bureaucracy and considerable investment on the manufacturers part explain why the medication is still available for sale PERIOD

It still doesnt account for how my local pharmacy was able to substitute the BXrated generics for my prescription without my or my doctors permission PERIOD In two weeks Ill see if I can explain what might PERIOD
