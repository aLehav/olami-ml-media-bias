You dont have to believe me its fine when I tell you that ESPN burgled my idea those bastards PERIOD Sure enough two weeks ago I was going to pen a PressBox about how baseball has recaptured the throne as national sport of preference PERIOD Then I got lazy ate a few Fruit RollUps and postponed it PERIOD Sure enough those commies at ESPN Page  hamstrung me and published their debate on the matter just last week PERIOD Im sure theres a lesson to be learned in all of this but Im too busy playing RBI Baseball to pick up on it PERIOD

Nevertheless I felt that my points on the matter  poignant if not tangential  went untouched by ESPN so Im continuing as scheduled with my coupla cents PERIOD Plus Im bitter about the whole thing PERIOD

As predicted the main detractor the ESPN folks provided for baseball was the idea of parity and indeed baseball does have an offensive amount of disparity within its financial system much like say the financial parity existing between myself and anyone who held a real job this summer PERIOD When an entire teams budget such as a smallmarket club like Milwaukee Brewers in   is roughly equal to the salary of a single player on another  hell ARod could fund the entire National League  theres an inherent dissonance that leaves things unbalanced PERIOD However I ask of you just how much of an impact does a high salary have on the performance of your team Or more importantly who cares

The way I see it there are two key differences that establish baseball as the dominant sport PERIOD The first is the fanfare surrounding each sport PERIOD

When it comes down to it football is a regional sport PERIOD Every city has their team and every team has their chance PERIOD The city of Cincinnati is collectively spitting their beverages across some sprawling metaphorical table as they realize that not only did their Bengals dethrone the mighty Chiefs and not only is quarterback Jon Kitna surpassing all expectations but that with a remaining schedule that features three teams with subpar records the ol Bungles are likely en route to the playoffs PERIOD

Meanwhile defending Super Bowl contenders Tampa Bay and Oakland are playing more like the Bengals if not the Bangles of yore floundering at the bottom of their divisions PERIOD Those cities it would seem had their time in the spotlight and thats how it goes in football  theres no chance to develop a dynasty or a national scourge because a teams quality of play changes too frequently PERIOD That may excite local fans whose team gets a chance at rebirth every year but on a national level it provides less a sense of loyalty than it does an opportunity for exciting gambling PERIOD

Baseball on the other hand truly is the nations sport PERIOD Look at baseballs League Championship Series and try not to wet yourself with anxiety  hell I was ripping through skivvies during the closing weeks PERIOD The entire country picked sides with incorrigible Yankees fans rooting for their own while anyone with any sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden pulled for good ol Boston and the Cubbies PERIOD Lack of parity

When I think of disparity I think of a Hummer vs PERIOD a Huffy PERIOD Janowitz vs PERIOD Holyfield PERIOD Shakira vs PERIOD all other females PERIOD I dont think of the American League Championship Series which in pairing the spendthrift Yankees against the wild card Red Sox provided one of the most exciting athletic spectacles of my day PERIOD Even better the World Series didnt offer an equal pairing but rather an underdog walloping delivered by the Marlins a small market team with a gradeschool lineup and Civil Warera gradeschool manager as they pulled the proverbial carpet out from under the Yanks PERIOD Thats sports right there PERIOD Football can keep its championshipinonegame format PERIOD Ill take a sevengame series between the national scourge and the national sweetheart any day PERIOD

Meanwhile not to be forgotten the other key difference the one that truly places baseball stories above football in the skyscraper of professional sports Stealing bases PERIOD

The day Peyton Manning giddyups his Colts  yards before the defense is set up is the day I hand the title back to football PERIOD When I see Tracy McGrady fake an inbounds pass and then dash to halfcourt along the sidelines or a NASCAR driver take a few extra spins during a yellow flag or Oscar De La Hoya sneak around and blast his opponent a few times between rounds  well dammit thats what Im talking about PERIOD

Theres a rather distressing amount of morality during athletic gameplay PERIOD For some inexplicable reason all felonious activity on the part of athletes takes place off the field PERIOD But not baseball It not only allows but encourages the furtive filching of bases and that along with all that other nonsense I rambled about before its why its the best sport in the world PERIOD
