5291,2013-02-20,"high school students in Trinidad and Tobago friends in an Internet caf in Nairobi Kenya and an elderly couple of 93yearolds in Germany all share one experience they took free online classes through Stanfords Venture Lab PERIOD

Launched last March the Stanforddeveloped platform for massive open online courses MOOCs has attracted over  students from over  countries in just under a year PERIOD Based on that success the platform branched out into an independent entity called NovoEd with the intention of developing national and international partnerships with other universities PERIOD

Unlike other forprofit MOOCs platforms such as Coursera and Udacity Venture Lab is a free enterprise with a focus on peer learning PERIOD

Instead of putting the spotlight on the professors and pretending that they know all the answers we put the spotlight on the students and help them unleash their own power said Amin Saberi director of Venture Lab and CEO of NovoEd PERIOD

Venture Lab develops that student power by organizing students taking a specific course into teams by using factors like geographic proximity and common language PERIOD Students earn individual reputation scores based on their contributions to the teams work ultimately creating a new social network through an online classroom PERIOD

In this transition from brick and mortar to online learning you shouldnt strip away the social the experiential or the collaborative aspect of learning Saberi said PERIOD

Assignments are based on video lectures by Stanford faculty posted on the course site PERIOD Students receive a statement of accomplishment upon completing the course PERIOD

Farnaz Ronaghi M.S PERIOD  Ph.D PERIOD  said that Venture Labs peer focus matches well with the programs skillbased interactive learning just as the masterybased learning of Coursera and Udacity fits their course models PERIOD

Ronaghi helped create Venture Lab as part of her Ph.D PERIOD focus on online education and team formation algorithms PERIOD She had previously worked with Saberi on a game theory lab and currently works with him as engineering manager of NovoEd PERIOD

Students ability to create their own online personas is key for developing lasting collaboration among students even after the courses close according to Ronaghi PERIOD There are at least  students still active per day on each course site where they can continue to communicate with their peers from fall  PERIOD

The concept for Venture Laband subsequently NovoEdoriginated in conversations between Saberi and Chuck Eesley assistant professor of management science and engineering PERIOD

Eesley whose Technology and Entrepreneurship class was the first course offered on the platform had historically videotaped his class lectures and wanted to make them more accessible to a global audience PERIOD That task has since become a fulltime job for Saberi PERIOD

I was actually planning on having a peaceful and quiet sabbatical Saberi said PERIOD

Eesleys course introduced students to the world of startups encouraging them to form their own through incentives PERIOD The top  teams in the course were assigned a professional mentor for their startup projects and the top  teams had the opportunity to pitch their ideas to venture capitalists PERIOD

Many teams went on to launch their startups commercially PERIOD That number includes TommyJamsa musicthemed startup based in India that allows performance venues to better select their acts through a fan review system PERIOD The founders of TommyJams met on Venture Lab with two team members resigning from their jobs at Microsoft to work full time on their startup project PERIOD

As the platform continues to expandwith  courses scheduled for next quarter including some from the Graduate School of Business and the School of Medicineproblems with authenticating student participants have persisted PERIOD

Saberi expressed optimism that new partnerships with other universities might help regulate the platforms user base as well as allowing NovoEd to thrive through an even broader audience PERIOD

Its been a venture for all of us Saberi concluded PERIOD
