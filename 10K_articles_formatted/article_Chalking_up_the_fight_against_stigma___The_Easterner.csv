By Al Stover Eagle Life EditorOctober  

Messages written in chalk like You are never alone and Stomp out stigma are scattered all over campus PERIOD These messages were written by the members of EWUs Active Minds chapter in celebration of National Day Without Stigma PERIOD
This is one of the events put on by the Active Minds EWU chapter PERIOD Active Minds is a group that educates students about mental illness issues lowers the negative attitude surrounding mental illness and encourages those struggling with these issues PERIOD
Sophomore Nicole Stearman began the process to create a chapter of Active Minds at Eastern last spring PERIOD While their family has a great support system at home her sister had been going through difficult times and told her sister how lucky she was to be involved with other campus groups and to have the support system on campus PERIOD
She said youre so lucky to have somewhere to go I dont have anywhere to go Stearman said PERIOD At that time I started thinking maybe I should start a club that focuses on mental health so I can involve people and make that sort of community PERIOD A club like Pride is huge but shes right there is no club that focuses on mental health issues. stearman has a tattoo of an anchor on her left wrist which matches the anchor tattoo on her sisters right wrist PERIOD This represents the bond between Nicole Stearman and her sister who was diagnosed with depression agora and anxiety at age  and schizoaffective disorder at age  PERIOD
After reading an article in The Easterner that mentioned Active Minds Stearman printed out the tool kit from the Active Mindss website with instructions on how to start a chapter PERIOD She then reached out to EWUs Counseling and Psychological Services PERIOD
Lisa Olson of CAPS met with Stearman last Spring to see if there were any organizations like Active Minds at EWU PERIOD According to Olson there were not any groups on campus that focused on mental health PERIOD
Its a wonderful way for students to learn about mental health and be able to discuss concerns or issues without any stigma associated with it Olson said PERIOD Were really pleased to have that kind of organization on campus and were also hoping it can let students know they can get the support and counseling they need. olson also led Stearman to the psychology department where she got in contact with Russell Kolts who acts as the adviser PERIOD
Kolts believes that the members of EWUs Active Minds chapter want to change the culture on campus that views mental illness with a negative stigma to one that is supportive of students suffering from mental illness PERIOD
People who struggle with these issues will not feel so cut off and alone Kolts said PERIOD Theyll feel like they have a connection to others  and maybe have an easier time making that first trip to the counseling center to make an appointment or share with a friend when they are feeling suicidal. according to their website Active Minds is a national nonprofit organization with over  chapters in the United States PERIOD
Zach Oxford who is majoring in psychology is the vice president of Active Minds PERIOD He joined the group to help spread the message of the club PERIOD
Mental illness is what people think it is Oxford said PERIOD I think people dont realize how many people actually suffer PERIOD Its great to show people out there that its not as rare as they think it is. stearman was diagnosed with social phobia disorder in high school PERIOD
With a combination of the support of her family her friends and medication she has come far in the last two years PERIOD
Although she believes that the stigma of mental illness at EWU is not as bad as it could be Stearman says there is work to be done when it comes to the behavior of others on campus PERIOD
Its being accepted but I have heard the language like this is schizo or the weather is bipolar and thats a problem Stearman said PERIOD
According to Kolts anyone who is struggling with a mental illness like depression anxiety will have a harder time dealing with the difficulties of their emotions if they feel other people around them have a certain kind of mindset towards them PERIOD
Theres enough of a social stigma around it that people often at times dont have the sense of feeling safe and supported and in many cases its the opposite Kolts said PERIOD A lot of times people feel that if other people knew they were anxious or struggling with depression or other difficult emotions that other people would look down upon them. in addition to National Day Without Stigma Active Minds will be hosting other events PERIOD
They are working with the Veterans Center and will bring speakers from Fairchild Airforce Base for Veterans Day PERIOD
For Stearman the ultimate goal at the moment is to get Active Minds established on campus and to get in touch with the Active Minds coordinator in the area PERIOD
I would love to expand everywhere and anywhere Stearman said PERIOD One of my friends is in a sorority PERIOD I feel like we could do some work with Greek Life and this issue PERIOD People who arent in any clubs people who are in a bunch of clubs PERIOD People who are in one club PERIOD I really dont care I just want people to come. eWU Counseling and Psychological Services
