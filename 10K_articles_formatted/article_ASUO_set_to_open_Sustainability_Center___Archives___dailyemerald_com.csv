7693,1970-01-01,"after much debate behind the creation of the campus Sustainability Center the Universitys first ASUO Student Sustainability Coordinator started work Monday PERIOD

The ASUO hired Louisa de Heer to become the coordinator prior to winter break PERIOD Already de Heer is teaming with ASUO Environmental Advocate Nathan Howard to plan a tabling event for all sustainability groups in the University Sustainability Coalition PERIOD

Were kind of just getting the ball rolling but theres been a lot of momentum already de Heer said PERIOD

de Heer said the fair and the event of opening the Sustainability Center will be her first big events as coordinator though she said EMU facilities holds control about when the coalition will be able to use the center PERIOD

I think the event will bring attention to the fact that the University is taking sustainability and integrating a lot of the efforts of student groups seriously she said PERIOD

de Heer said her motivation in working with this position is to create a genuine lasting impact for University students PERIOD

What theyre getting out of their classrooms is the most uptodate science that we have de Heer said PERIOD And bringing that into our daily lives and how we vote with our wallet every day when we make decisions those are things were learning together PERIOD We know the general place that our society needs to get to. howard said he thinks several hundred students will attend the fair with sustainability groups tabling on each side of the EMU Concourse PERIOD

The whole concept of having a coalition center and coordinator is that all those people who have passion for those issues can center their efforts and speak with one voice Howard said PERIOD To have that there has to be a lot of participation in the individual student groups and so this fair is going to try to bring in members previously unengaged in the student groups. howard said the coalition reserved the concourse for Feb PERIOD  where the  campus sustainability groups will be holding tables and informing uninvolved students about the various options and the coalitions goals for the term PERIOD

Primarily each individual group will be focused on the tabling for their group and the planning will be done by Howard de Heer and Campus Recycling Education Coordinator Cimmeron Gillespie PERIOD

Gillespie said this tabling event should inspire a collaborative effort for sustainability groups on campus PERIOD

If one group was tabling or having events by themselves it only goes so far but when you start talking about  to  groups it takes on its own feel Gillespie said PERIOD I dont have an exact vision for how the sustainability coordinator will work in the future but I have really high hopes for the position. fbainsdailyemerald.com
