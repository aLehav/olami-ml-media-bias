This Saturday marked the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina which destroyed the city of New Orleans and devastated people across the country who viewed the misery through TV screens and newspaper headlines PERIOD

The disaster emblazoned itself in the American psyche making its mark as one of the worst natural disasters witnessed in recent history PERIOD We remember how people risked their own lives to try to save strangers and how neighbors who lost everything made valiant efforts to rebuild what was left behind PERIOD We remember the people begging for help and the deceased bodies drifting through the streets made of muddy water and trash PERIOD

We also remember that the people of New Orleans didnt receive the help they needed PERIOD Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Michael Brown who in no way was equipped to run the disaster relief efforts even blamed the people of the Gulf Coast for making their own predicament worse by not fully complying with evacuation orders PERIOD Fox News host Bill OReilly called them addicts who refused to abandon the source for their drugs PERIOD The fact of the matter is the people of New Orleans deserved to be rescued but they werent  and that made them angry PERIOD

Michael Brown PERIOD Injustice PERIOD Media PERIOD Anger PERIOD

We as Americans all remember Katrina but it is inarguably impossible for us to remember the disaster in identical ways PERIOD In particular sociologists agreed that Katrina was a cultural trauma that stabbed black political consciousness in its beating heart and left the scar of a bitter legacy PERIOD

White people denied the racial divide then and Im sure they will continue to do so even though Kanye West himself said George Bush dont care about black people and Im confused that anyone would argue with Kanye PERIOD But readers of course everyone knows that not only black people suffered from Hurricane Katrina PERIOD The entire nation grieved however it is true that environmental racism is a prevalent reality in our society PERIOD When natural disasters like Katrina happen  disasters which will increase in frequency and intensity in coming years due to the effects of global climate change  environmental racism strikes in typical fashion PERIOD

The racial divide was and remains brutally real PERIOD The Black Lives Matter sentiment was born in the ravaged neighborhoods of Katrina in  emerging from a place of neglect devastation and social chaos PERIOD Ten years later we hear the same themes and even the same names in a different context PERIOD

Michael Brown PERIOD Injustice PERIOD Media PERIOD Anger PERIOD

How many times are we going to remind black Americans that the system we are all embedded within is indifferent to their lives How long can we pretend that the harms we inflict upon our planet arent disproportionately distributed in our society If All Lives Matter why are white victims of Katrina praised by the media for finding food amongst the mayhem but black refugees are framed as criminals for looting local businesses And why are people still living in FEMA trailers laced with formaldehyde

This weekend I drove through the night to go to New Orleans for Gulf South Rising PERIOD One goal of this movement is to highlight the effects of climate change throughout the Gulf region PERIOD In commemoration of the 10year anniversary of Katrina Gulf South Rising also demands a just transition away from extractive industries discriminatory policies and unjust practices that hinder equitable disaster recovery and impede the development of sustainable communities. the seas are rising and so are we together in one united front against the intersectional injustices we are all a part of PERIOD

Bias keeps us divided even in the midst of tragedies when we should come together to create a better America for all its citizens PERIOD For the tenth anniversary of Katrina however we come together to look at where New Orleans stands today in the wake of the hurricane and the progress that remains to be made PERIOD We should do the same when it comes to race relations and environmental justice in our nation PERIOD
