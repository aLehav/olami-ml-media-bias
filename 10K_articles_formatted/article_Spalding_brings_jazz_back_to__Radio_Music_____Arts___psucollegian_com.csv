After winning the Grammy for Best New Artist in  jazz bassist and vocalist Esperanza Spalding garnered a great deal of public outcry PERIOD

After all she beat Justin Bieber PERIOD Not a lot of people can say that  dont get me wrong all hail Biebz PERIOD

Now Spalding is back with her first album since the Grammy win seized after the success of 2010s Chamber Music Society and its a pop outing PERIOD

Released on March  the aptly named Radio Music Society stands not as an attempt to appeal to the masses though it will undoubtedly do so with one of contemporary jazzs ambassadors at the helm PERIOD

Its a labor of love a departure from her more straightforward past jazz material but an amalgam of the genres Spalding loves  pop funk multiple jazz generations and perhaps most prominently RB PERIOD

While its hard to compare the album to Chamber Music Society which could be argued as the superior of Spaldings two most recent outings I still couldnt help but mutter to myself Dang she can sing and Dang she can play while listening to Radio Music Society. she just doesnt hold back PERIOD

As a bassist myself Spalding puts on yet another clinic on both electric and acoustic bass PERIOD Shes tasteful on the swooning Vague Suspicions and hella funky on the dense fusion workout Endangered Species proving that theres no real distinction between the female and male players out there PERIOD

She unleashes her some of her best funkiest songwriting on Black Gold an enlivening tribute to AfricanAmericans everywhere with lyrics that sound funnier on paper than in the song itself a personal favorite because of its sprawling muted bass PERIOD Spalding along neosoul singer Algebra Blessett sings before a huge chorus Think of all the strength you have in you  from all the blood you carry within you PERIOD  Ancient men powerful men  built us a civilization. spalding demonstrates her singing chops best on cover of the late Michael Jacksons I Cant Help It originally written by Stevie Wonder PERIOD On tunes like this she fully realizes her status as an indispensable voice with a startlingly unique perspective PERIOD

Still even a poppy Spalding can falter especially on single Radio Song a surprisingly unaffecting entry PERIOD In any case I cant wait until summer to listen to the light warm yet rewarding Radio Music Society. grade B
