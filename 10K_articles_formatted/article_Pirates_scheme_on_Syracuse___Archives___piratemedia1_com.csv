Updated November     pm



The ECU football team travels to Syracuse this weekend for an outofconference battle against the Orangemen PERIOD The Pirates go into New Yorks Carrier Dome with a twogame winning streak in tact PERIOD

 said quarterback David Garrard PERIOD 

The Orangemen are led by Head Coach Paul Pasqualoni the winningest active coach in the BIG EAST PERIOD Pasqualoni has guided seven of the ten teams he has coached to bowl appearances and stands in eleventh place in alltime wins among active DivisionIA head coaches PERIOD

Syracuse also enters Saturdays game having won two consecutive games PERIOD Before defeating Central Florida and Auburn in the two previous weeks the Orangemen dropped backtoback games to Georgia Tech and Tennessee two of the nations premiere squads PERIOD

 said Head Pirate Coach Steve Logan PERIOD 

In last years meeting ECU used a 21point second quarter to ruin a rainy night in Bagwell for the Orangemen  PERIOD Sophomore Terrance Coppers blocked punt from last year should provide some extra incentive for a Pirate special teams squad that has been hot of late PERIOD

 Logan said PERIOD 

The Pirates offense with seniors Garrard and Leonard Henry in the backfield will be hoping for success against a Syracuse defense which held Georgia Tech to only  points on opening day PERIOD The Pirates win nearly  percent of the time when they rush for more than  yards PERIOD

 Logan said PERIOD 

 Garrard said PERIOD 

The Syracuse defense is led by two of the nations top candidates for AllAmerican honors handed to the best performers at the end of the season PERIOD Defensive end Dwight Freeney has  sacks in his last  games and behind him will be junior linebacker Clifton Smith PERIOD

The Pirates have had some trouble stopping the run thus far in the season so halting senior Syracuse tailback James Mungro who has racked up nearly  yards in the first four games could be the key to an ECU win PERIOD

 Logan said PERIOD 

Against Auburn Syracuse ran the ball on more than half of the downs PERIOD With knowledge of this Logan and the Pirates will be looking to integrate the blitz into their defensive attack PERIOD

 said senior linebacker Greg LeFever PERIOD Thats what they do PERIOD Regardless of what happens were going to go out and play hard and try to shut them down.I know our defense can step up and take on the offenses of other teams PERIOD As long as we can get in there and put the ball in the endzone I think well do well. garrard said PERIOD

Saturdays game time is set for  p.m PERIOD The ECU and Syracuse matchup will be televised on local televisions WITNTV channel  PERIOD
