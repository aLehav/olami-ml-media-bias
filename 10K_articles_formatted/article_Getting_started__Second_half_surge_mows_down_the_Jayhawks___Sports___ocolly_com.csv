The hardest part of mowing a lawn is getting the mower started PERIOD

All the grass in sight in Lawrence Kansas might have been dead and brittle when the Oklahoma State Cowgirls played the Kansas Jayhawks on Saturday night but once OSU got started it mowed down its competition defeating KU  PERIOD

The Cowgirls struggled to get started scoring only nine points in the first quarter shooting  from the field and turning the ball over six times PERIOD

I think they KU is really good defensive team that is really well coached and they got a member on their staff that was a part of our program so there was a familiarity with the things we do and all of that and I think that was a factor OSU coach Jim Littell said PERIOD

Sometimes its just hard to get going because the scouts in this league are so good and the coaches do such a good job. oSU finished the half with  points but thanks to solid defense and equally poor shooting from the Jayhawks they entered the locker room with a twopoint lead PERIOD

The Cowgirls put some serious acreage behind them in the third quarter wbe they distanced themselves from the Jayhawks PERIOD They outscored KU  in the frame on the back of  third quarter points from sophomore Lauren Fields PERIOD

Lauren fields was outstanding tonight Littell said PERIOD The level of her aggressive play really picked us up. the Jayhawks never got their mower started even as the Cowgirls took the proverbial lid off the basket PERIOD

KU finished the game having made only  of their shots PERIOD They were also only  for  from the 3point line which makes winning a basketball game a monumental challenge PERIOD

We were having trouble guarding them off the bounce and then we went to a zone and they missed a lot of shots Littell said PERIOD I think theyre a better shooting team than what we saw tonight. all that a team can do when nothing is going its way is continue to fight like everything is going right PERIOD

We werent real pretty in the first half and neither was Kansas Littell said PERIOD But I thought our kids stayed positive our coaches stayed positive we kept really staying after it. sports.edocolly.com
