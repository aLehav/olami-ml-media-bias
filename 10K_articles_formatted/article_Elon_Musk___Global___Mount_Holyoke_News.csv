Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla recently expressed uncertainty about whether his takeover bid for the social media service Twitter would be successful according to an April  article from the BBC PERIOD Prior to the conference at which he communicated his doubts Musk offered to buy the company for . a share valuing the firm at 43bn as reported by BBC PERIOD He also mentioned the existence of a Plan B but did not disclose the content of the plan PERIOD

I think its very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech Musk said on Twitter when discussing his motivations for the takeover bid PERIOD

Professor emeritus of politics Chris Pyle criticized Musks intentions regarding free speech PERIOD

Elon Musk wants to buy one of the biggest printing presses in the country and allow it to function largely without supervision PERIOD He claims to be a defender of free speech but hes not PERIOD He thinks of himself as a libertarian but the ideas he wishes to liberate are those of rich people like himself PERIOD He really doesnt understand that an unrestricted social media platform really doesnt advance free speech PERIOD It will just advance the freedom of rich men like himself to distort the marketplace of political ideas often with fake news Pyle said PERIOD

Lots of mistakes are going to be made by wellmeaning censors before anything approaching a stable consensus on what should be allowable speech is going to be reached Pyle concluded PERIOD

Musk hasnt been the only prominent figure to express interest in purchasing Twitter PERIOD Saudi Arabias Prince Alwaleed bin Talal  who claimed that he has a stake in Twitter through his investment firm Kingdom Holding Company  commented on Twitter about Musks offer PERIOD I dont believe that the proposed offer by Elon Musk comes close to the intrinsic value of Twitter given its growth prospects he said PERIOD

Musk replied immediately asking how many Twitter shares Alwaleed bin Talals firm owns PERIOD Musk added What are the Kingdoms views on journalist freedom of speech

Bryan Nakayama a visiting lecturer in international relations and politics discussed his opinion about Musks stated aim to promote free speech on the platform PERIOD

Based on what Ive seen most users in the U.S PERIOD are able to express a fairly wide range of views and opinions from the mainstream to extreme PERIOD Speech is more restricted on certain topics  such as healthsensitive topics or types of speech such as death threats or imagery of child sexual exploitation Nakayama said PERIOD One sticky area is the question of disinformation and algorithmic radicalization  for people on the political extremes something that is considered disinformation would be a normal belief or interpretation of reality Nakayama continued PERIOD

Who gets to adjudicate that is a difficult question PERIOD Similarly there are attempts to stem the activity of extremist groups like QAnon Nakayama said PERIOD There is no evidence of political bias in the moderation system but automated moderation systems like Twitter can be gamed by individuals using mass reporting to get accounts taken down PERIOD The main clear area of bias is in the  promotion algorithm which favors the right PERIOD
