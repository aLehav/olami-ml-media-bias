The print industry is sagging newspapers are shutting down authors and reporters everywhere are out of jobs  such are just a few casualties of the digital revolution PERIOD

However amid the rush to discover new innovative ways of using the Internet while keeping print options profitable several authors of popular blogs have seen success going from binary code to paper turning their daily musings and observations into book form PERIOD

Blogs such as   and  have been on the public dotcom radar for quite some time for divergent reasons whether it be pointing out recognizable aspects of white culture sharing truetolife embarrassing moments or discussing the social value of romance novels PERIOD But recently the creators of those blogs have each taken the next step and released books based on their online work PERIOD

  and  are all currently available with new material for purchase in book form PERIOD Later this year there will be a followup to 

In such a digital age it may surprise some at how effortlessly this content is making the successful leap from the Internet to print PERIOD Word of mouth certainly helps said Ryan Doherty an editor at Villard Books which put out 

 Doherty wrote in an email interview PERIOD

But because of the uniqueness of this translation process its not without its problems PERIOD

Often Doherty said the real trick is getting a customer to buy something when he or she could get something similar to it free of charge with a simple Google search PERIOD

It helps that essentially  due to the popularity of the blog Doherty said PERIOD 

According to a recent report put out by Publishers Weekly and the Institute for Publishing Research trade paperback sales are expected to dip  percent in  and adult hardcover sales nearly  percent PERIOD So why publish a book now when digital media seem to be slowly but surely pushing print toward the back burner

According to Jill Schwartzman a senior editor at Random House  its because books offer many different things to the consumer that blogs cannot PERIOD While digital media can be cheap and convenient she said it wont be able anytime soon to replace the tangible qualities that come with owning a book PERIOD

Beside the fact that there is a substantial amount of material in the  book that cant be found online Schwartzman said the advantage of the book is that 

Releasing a book also allows the author to bring his or her material to an entirely new audience one that might not surf the Web as much as he or she peruses the bookstore aisles PERIOD

According to Christian Lander the creator of  about half of his book is new content while the other half is culled from previous entries PERIOD

 Lander said PERIOD

For the most part the editors and authors of these blog books tend to see the digital revolution as less of an encroachment on a sacred medium than simply a different way to access information PERIOD In other words print and digital media dont have to cancel each other out PERIOD

 wrote Sarah Wendell cofounder of  via email PERIOD

 Schwartzman said PERIOD 

The same goes for books she said PERIOD



Doherty agreed PERIOD Print will never completely die he said PERIOD
