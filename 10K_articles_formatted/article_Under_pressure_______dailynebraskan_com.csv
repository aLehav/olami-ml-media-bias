Huskers dark side shows up on KU road game

Dave Morantz is a columnist for the University Daily Kansan in Lawrence Kan PERIOD

My faith in humanity was damaged this weekend PERIOD

An invasion of Winnebagos and red white and black Starter jackets forever changed my opinion of college athletics and opened my eyes to the insane yet powerful desire to follow a football team across the nation PERIOD

It began Friday night with the preliminary wave of fans PERIOD Middleaged Cornhuskers clad in Nebraska paraphernalia filed into a quiet downtown pub PERIOD They stood huddled in small groups like their collegeaged heroes on the field clutching bottles of Bud Light PERIOD

Standing in the middle of peoples dart games they laughed and yelled out predictions to the next days football game hoping to draw comments from local bar patrons PERIOD Like almost everyone else at the bar not wearing a big  on their forehead I paid them little attention PERIOD

But the next day they multiplied PERIOD Like a red tide at sea they spread across Lawrence tearing up gardens and yards as they beached their mammoth vehicles in search of spots to tailgate PERIOD

 one fan yelled after stepping out of a red bus that he parked in front of my apartment building PERIOD Making sure everyone knew a Nebraska fan had arrived he reached through the driversside window and honked the horn PERIOD The first few notes of the Nebraska fight song rang through the neighborhood PERIOD

 he screamed arms raised to the sky PERIOD 

Sure they have a lot to brag about PERIOD Their football team could challenge many professional teams PERIOD

Their offensive linemen push opponents wherever they desire giving the team an option play that NFL coaches would kill to have PERIOD And most impressively they somehow find a way to attract the best high school football prospects to Lincoln a town with about as much appeal as Waco Texas PERIOD

But Nebraska football like many bigtime college athletic programs has a dark side created by the expectations and pressures of the more than  Nebraska fans that enveloped Lawrence this weekend PERIOD

A friend of mine saw the most graphic sign of this dark side Saturday night at a downtown bar PERIOD

 a former Nebraska player in his late 20s asked her PERIOD

He rolled up his left sleeve to reveal a dark circle at the base of his forearm PERIOD A mark the player said of years of steroid abuse while competing for the Cornhuskers PERIOD

Now like many other exCornhuskers he follows the team as they strive for another undefeated season and another national championship PERIOD He adds to a fan base that cursed quarterback Scott Frost last year for the teams loss to Arizona State its first loss in two seasons PERIOD

He physically suffered from the pressure to win and now he contributes to it PERIOD

Of all the fans that came to Lawrence this weekend this one knows what its like to enter an opponents stadium and receive more fan support than the home team PERIOD He knows the joy of defeating a quality opponent PERIOD He also knows the pain of losing PERIOD

But does he remember the pressure that drove him to steroids

Each Saturday a part of me wants Nebraska to lose PERIOD Not because of their players offfield problems or because of the obnoxious fan who was so proud of his melodious horn PERIOD I just dont like teams that never lose PERIOD

Yet a loss could be devastating for the Nebraska players many of whom are just out of high school PERIOD

The criticism of crazed Cornhusker fans rivals the cheap shots of New York sportswriters PERIOD

I wonder if the fan camped out in my front yard on Saturday realizes that his idols his motivation for trekking across the country through snow and rain are merely college students physically unmatched but emotionally inexperienced PERIOD

I would hope the inhumane pressure to win will not drive a current Nebraska player to sit in a Lawrence bar in  years and display what college football is all about PERIOD
