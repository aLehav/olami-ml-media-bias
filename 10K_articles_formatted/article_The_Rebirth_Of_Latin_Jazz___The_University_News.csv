3640,2018-10-10,"the BSide Players a salsabased tribe of funky jazzsters has become San Diegos hottest party band not to mention that they topped the local band sales charts last year with their latest CD titled Renacimiento Spanish for rebirth PERIOD

Three percussionists three horn players bass and guitar sum up the BSide Players who are grounded in Latin music and filthy funk PERIOD

San Diegos funksalsa band is easily comparable to that of the sounds of Ozomatli PERIOD

One thing that makes them different from Ozomatli is that the BSide Players are  dedicated individuals functioning as one single unit PERIOD On Renacimiento no song is credited to one individual PERIOD

If you broke the 10piece band down to any four members you would have a first rate jazz ensemble PERIOD

Jazz is the basis of the band when hearing them play and the jazz is backed with the Santanaesque salsa and Curtis MayfieldTower of Power soul that cant be compared PERIOD

After listening to the new CD I thought Who said Ricky Martin is the king of salsa Well whoever said that has it all wrong PERIOD

The BSide Players are the love child of Carlos Santana and it is evident on every  song on their album Renacimiento and in every live show they play PERIOD

When these guys come live nobody can resist the groove established by the Players everybody dances whether they intend to or not PERIOD

The bands show is one nonstop dance party that makes MTVs World Groove look like a high school mixer PERIOD

Tonight the BSide Players make their way through the Midwest bringing the beach of sunny Southern California with a mexican conga party line to the stage of the Side Door PERIOD

No doubt about it the BSide Players bring the masses together and unite people of all races for at least the two hours the band occupies the stage PERIOD

By incorporating a worldy variety of music from Latin to salsa to jazz it is easy to say the idealistic and talented BSide Players are able to rock the world PERIOD

For one of the best unknown bands in the nation be sure to boogie your way on down to the Side Door and see the BSide Players in a small intimate setting or wait until next time the Players come through town and theyre playing the Fox PERIOD

Dubtronics opens for the latin jazz masters with doors at  p.m PERIOD

Tickets are an obnoxious  PERIOD What a great price to pay for great music PERIOD
