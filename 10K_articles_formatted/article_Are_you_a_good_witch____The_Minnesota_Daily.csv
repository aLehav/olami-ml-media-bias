5099,2023-11-04,"contemporary artists show their respect to Yoko Ono on the remix album Yes Im a Witch

by  Sara Nicole MillerPublished  February  

In the minds of many a Beatles fan and there are plenty out there Yoko Ono is the Cruella DeVille of the music world an iconoclastic nemesis of all things rock n roll PERIOD

It perhaps also doesnt help that many fans wrongly blamed her marriage to John Lennon for the Fab Fours breakup PERIOD And when she wasnt the center of a systematic Beatlemania smear campaign her experimental art has often been internationally lampooned and poked at by socalled purveyors of real art and music PERIOD Even the sardonic title of her new album Yes Im a Witch while decades after the heyday of Ono bashing still bears the battle scars of a lifetime of media brutality PERIOD

Yoko Ono
TITLE Yes Im a Witch
LABEL Astralwerks

In short Ono is one of the most underrated artistic talents in modern pop culture PERIOD Ono who was born in Tokyo Japan and moved to New York in the 1950s with her parents became a leading figure in the vibrant experimental avantgarde scene  before she even met the gangly British bloke PERIOD

In her  work Cut Piece she invited spectators to approach her grab a pair of scissors and cut off chunks of cloth from her outfit until she was nearly naked PERIOD She also was responsible for a  imaginary art exhibit at the New York Museum of Modern Art in which she filmed spectators looking at well virtually nothing PERIOD

While Onos work has been for the most part accepted in the visual contemporary art community her cathartic primal wailing vocals have received the brunt of the chiding and mockery PERIOD To underestimate her influence on music however is a mistake PERIOD Her musical endeavors have inspired the likes of The B52s and Talking Heads PERIOD Many groundbreaking artists have cited her as inspiration and club kids have been whirling to her remixed grooves for years PERIOD

This time around on Yes Im a Witch Ono gets by with a little help from her new musical friends PERIOD For the album Ono handpicked  artists  among them Cat Power Le Tigre Shitake Monkey and The Polyphonic Spree  and gave them full access to her original recordings both as

released and the studio outtakes and the creative freedom to do whatever they desired with her work PERIOD Most of them used only the vocal tracks and created the backdrops from scratch PERIOD

Each artist brings something different to the table and the result is inventive and entrancing PERIOD Rising with DJ Spooky boasts galactic record scratching crescendos and eerie nasal wails that give way to layered vocal sounds similar to the noise of someone vomiting PERIOD

The Apples In Stereo remix No One Can See Me Like You Do while somewhat a victim of convention the song brings out the introspective canon that encapsulates most of Onos vocals they round it off with robust church bell chiming and lush skyspanning melodies PERIOD

Peaches hot to trot in her usual robotic eroticism and clappy playground baselines cranks out an irresistible accompaniment to Onos ascent into vocal orgasm in Japanese PERIOD

Not surprisingly The Flaming Lips took her most obscure avantgarde track Cambridge  in which Ono basically holds an atonal drone for  minutes and  seconds PERIOD The Flaming Lips frame it with a funky electronic baseline and what sounds like a grade school band tuning up before a concert PERIOD Odd as that sounds it manages to work PERIOD

The eclectic collaborations result in a new refreshing spin on an old yet fantastical Yoko PERIOD Yes Im a Witch beyond capturing the scope of her deceptively prevalent influence pays testament to her imaginative songwriting skills and her capacity for stirring up candid and mesmerizing melodies PERIOD Her rightful place as an icon in experimental music might finally be recognized PERIOD After all the best musicians in the biz got her back PERIOD
