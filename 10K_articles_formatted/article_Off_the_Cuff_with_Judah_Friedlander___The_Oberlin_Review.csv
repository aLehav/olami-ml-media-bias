Judah Friedlander
comedian and World Champion

Allegra Kirkland EditorInChiefApril  

Youve been doing standup since you were  PERIOD Did you ever consider a career outside of comedy Was there any point in your career where you got tired of it and wanted to quit

If youre not working on new material then you can get bored of your act but I try to always be working on new stuff PERIOD Traveling can also get tiring but comedy is my most favorite thing to do PERIOD Its what I live for PERIOD Ive also done a lot of drama too PERIOD  I feel like if youre involved in art in any form you should try making all kinds of art it will only make you better at what you do PERIOD

Youve said that standup is what you feel most comfortable doing PERIOD What about it appeals to you

T.V PERIOD and film can be really boring PERIOD With  Rock for example it takes  hours to film one 22minute episode PERIOD Theres a lot of repetition a lot of waiting around PERIOD Its basically filmed like a movie PERIOD But standup is pretty much all action its live its happening in the moment PERIOD Its you and the crowd doing stuff together PERIOD Standup needs an audience it feeds off of it PERIOD Thats the main thing that appeals to me about live performance  the immediacy of it PERIOD I also like the sense that anything can happen PERIOD Theres something sort of fake and manufactured about T.V PERIOD and movies in comparison PERIOD

Who are your favorite audiences to perform for in terms of demographics or regions of the country

My ideal audience would be very diverse and encompass all races all sexual persuasions all political persuasions all income levels PERIOD Without pandering one of my goals as a comedian is to be good enough and funny enough that no matter what Im talking about everyone is going to get it and like it PERIOD That doesnt mean Im going to make my act bland  Im not into that at all  but I believe in the philosophy that if I work hard enough and write funny enough stuff it can really appeal to a broad audience PERIOD  In terms of favorite places to perform Id say the Comedy Cellar in New York PERIOD Thats probably the place where Ive performed the most and where I get the most mixed audiences PERIOD

Time for the requisite  Rock question how do you think the show has changed since it first went on air in 

Do you feel its changed I dont watch it that often but I feel that its changed PERIOD What do you think The show to me  and Im talking about in terms of acting on it not necessarily watching it  has always been a writerheavy show with Tina Fey of course being the driving force behind that along with a few other writerproducers like Robert Carlock the other cohead writer PERIOD In film the auteur is normally the director and in T.V PERIOD comedies its the writers PERIOD The first season or two were actually less writerdominant then they are now PERIOD There was a little more room for improvising PERIOD  Everything now is pretty much  percent wordforword from the script PERIOD  I think some of that has to do with the fact that the writers have been writing the show longer so they know it better PERIOD The show is just different than it was at the beginning PERIOD Its more  whats the word  not out there but less realistic PERIOD

Do you mean in terms of relying on fabricated situations for comedic effect rather than relying on the interactions between the actors

Sure PERIOD The show is still grounded in reality but there are a lot more elements that are just flatout jokes flatout absurd PERIOD Theres definitely more absurdity in the show now then there used to be PERIOD

I saw your collection of bad art on your website  lots of neon cheetahs and Elvis portraits PERIOD Where do you find the art you collect and what constitutes bad art for you

Ive been thinking about this and I actually changed the name to amazing art PERIOD To me bad art is just something that does nothing for me PERIOD Its just a turnoff PERIOD This could be anything from art hanging in a great museum to art hanging on the wall of a Super  motel if it has nothing original nothing unique and does nothing to excite me I would call it bad PERIOD Amazing or amazingbad art would be rejected by a museum or gallery but to me theres something special there whether it was intended by the artist or not PERIOD Maybe you can see the passion of the artist despite their lack of artistic skill or maybe its just really terrible like a high school art class painting where you can tell that the person didnt want to make it  they wanted to cut class and smoke pot or try to hook up with some girl or shoplift from the  or something but they were forced to go to class and draw something PERIOD So what they draw is really a fuck you to the teacher PERIOD Art like that can be awesome PERIOD So its hard to say but it has to excite me PERIOD Its often something that most people would find horrible but I find something special in it PERIOD For an analogy lets say theres someone male or female who you dont find attractive PERIOD But someone else is dating them so they have found something in the person that is attractive that makes them special PERIOD

Could you talk a little about your experience living in Cleveland while filming American Splendor Where did you live and what did you like to do while you were living here

I was in Cleveland for about three to four weeks and I tried to get to know the city as much as I could PERIOD I probably hit Cleveland every year or two doing standup and Toby  the guy who my character was based on  I still keep in touch with him PERIOD

For American Splendor I tried to get to know the city as much as possible because I really felt that the city was a character in the movie PERIOD Certain cities are very unique and have a strong personality and Cleveland is one of them PERIOD I saw the movie Warrior last year which takes place in Pittsburgh PERIOD I loved the movie but no one except one minor character had an accent PERIOD And Pittsburgh has an accent a strong accent PERIOD  To me it could have been any bluecollar city but it certainly wasnt Pittsburgh PERIOD I think when you do a movie thats based in reality youve got to do as much homework as you can to really make things authentic PERIOD  Cleveland is a city that a lot of people have left over the years but at the same time a lot of people have stuck around PERIOD Its a tough city  the weather alone makes it a tough city  but its got strong people PERIOD  Its very unpretentious very workingclass and yet its also got an artsy scene PERIOD I dig it PERIOD
