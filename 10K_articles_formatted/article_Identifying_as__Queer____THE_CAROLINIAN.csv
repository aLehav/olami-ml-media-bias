I think labels get a bad reputation PERIOD Often times people believe labels are a way to divide everyone and isolate those who do not fall within that same demographic PERIOD I dont believe that is always the case PERIOD One might identify with something because they feel pride in that aspect of themselves especially in the cases of culture or ethnicity PERIOD Not seeing color is an unhelpful and sometimes harmful attitude to have towards those of different races PERIOD Labels can create a sense of identity and community and bring individuals together PERIOD That is especially true in the LGBTQ community PERIOD

The acronym LGBTQ itself exists solely because of labels PERIOD It can be empowering to those who may finally feel like they have found a word to describe themselves PERIOD After years of confusion and possibly trying out different labels that didnt work its a relief to find one particular word that fits like Cindarellas slipper PERIOD But what about the people who feel like theyve tried on every kind of shoe they could find and nothing feels quite right

There is a push for people to label themselves PERIOD Its efficient PERIOD In order to profit from the masses they must be categorized PERIOD There are articles of clothing exclusively for women or for men PERIOD To make it even easier the store is split up into sections by gender PERIOD Even in a more liberal setting pride parades often have free buttons with every sexuality and gender identity you could think of PERIOD What about those that stare into that box of bright colors surrounded by likeminded people and still dont find the one they think is them

The thing that most people dont realize is that that feeling is completely normal PERIOD Not everyone is going to fit neatly into a box checked gay or straight. even the other boxes may not describe everyone either PERIOD That is completely okay because human sexuality is not that simple PERIOD One cannot take a test and get clear results back PERIOD More than that sexuality exists on a spectrum not a multiple choice test question PERIOD

Because of this the word queer has been adopted as a label for ones sexuality PERIOD While it also exists as an umbrella term for nonheterosexual andor noncisgender people it is also an identity on its own PERIOD But what does queer mean

The most important thing to know about the word queer is that it was first and foremost a slur PERIOD While some have found empowerment in it and have begun to reclaim it there are still plenty of LGBTQ people that find it offensive or just do not connect with the word PERIOD Its important not to generalize people as queer just because it can be allencompassing PERIOD

There are plenty of reasons one might call themselves queer PERIOD There is the old bisexual vs pansexual debate PERIOD Some argue that bisexual is exclusive of trans or nonbinary people while others think of pansexual as being a hypercorrection to the term bisexual PERIOD Some feel that queer resolves this issue of semantics PERIOD Of course this is not to say that bisexuality and pansexuality are not valid and inclusive labels because they absolutely are PERIOD

Queer can also feel right to trans folks who are attracted to the opposite gender but do not feel that the word straight describes them PERIOD

Sexuality is a very personal thing PERIOD It can take a really long time to truly understand yourself and your experiences PERIOD Most importantly it is not one size fits all PERIOD Queer is whatever queer means to you PERIOD It has a right to exist in the LGBTQ community and in everyday life PERIOD Queer is inclusive and empowering for those who identify with it PERIOD For some its a relief PERIOD Queer can be a label without the strict boundaries that a lot of sexualities suggest PERIOD

A lot of people dont understand identifying as queer PERIOD Maybe in the future it will be normalized and not questioned so harshly PERIOD Those who openly call themselves queer often get met with a barrage of question some more prying and intimate than others PERIOD What does that mean is a common and harmless one PERIOD However questions get intrusive and even offensive when they branch into Well who do you want to sleep with and Ive never heard of that or the dreaded Isnt that just bisexualpansexualgay

Its important to understand that the only person responsible in identifying yourself is you PERIOD No one else can tell you what youre feeling and who you are attracted to PERIOD People may try to simplify or edit your identity to make it into something they are more comfortable with but that doesnt change anything about you PERIOD If the word queer feels like your Cinderella slipper there is no one on this Earth that can tell you otherwise PERIOD
