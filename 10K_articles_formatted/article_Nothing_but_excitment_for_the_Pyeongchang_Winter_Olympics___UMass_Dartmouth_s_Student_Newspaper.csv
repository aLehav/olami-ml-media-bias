9065,2018-02-08,"the Pyeongchang Winter  Olympics is ready to take flight February  and run through February  and I am so excited Over two weeks of pure excitement right on your television screen

There is nothing like routing for the USA in the various events and sports featured throughout the next couple of weeks PERIOD

The opening ceremonies are always a must watch as you see all the athletes stroll in proudly PERIOD Its incredible seeing all the different countries participate and to see talented athletes who we may have never seen otherwise PERIOD Plus this makes for a great night with the family your roomies and besties PERIOD

That means bring out the munchies and appetizers for a fun filled night PERIOD Plus football season will be over so all attention will go over to our USA Olympic teams so why not throw a celebration

One of my favorite competitions would be hands down gymnastics PERIOD I know I know I have never participated in the art of flips and back handsprings however I find it fascinating on how one can craft themselves into these beautiful routines PERIOD

The USA is known for having elite gymnasts and all I can think of is the Fierce Five from the  Summer Olympics those girls had natural born talent PERIOD So my expectations for the winter categories stand very high PERIOD

I remember being in New York City with my family for the weekend and going to Good Morning America and seeing the gymnasts such as Aly Raisman on the show and talk about their experiences which was amazing PERIOD

Even though there arent any gymnastics in the winter edition of the Olympics the most recent news of Dr PERIOD Larry Nassar assaulting the gymnasts of the Fierce Five and the girls standing together during his sentencing shows the power of the sportmanship and teamwork between the girls and all the athletes of the Olympics PERIOD

This really makes me excited for the Olympics this winter and seeing the athletes work together again PERIOD

And plus the Winter Olympics features a wide array of sports that is sure to captivate the attention of anyone PERIOD

I mean how can they be boring when there is so much action going on

There is literally a category for everyone figure skating speed skating skiing luge snowboarding you name a winter sport and they most likely have it PERIOD

Figure skating is my alltime favorite to watch the way they skate so gracefully around the rink is impressive. this years competition is looking good as I feel we have a strong team that can take the lead and bring the medal home to the U.S PERIOD

According to Time A rising figure skating star Nathan Chen was the first U.S PERIOD man in eight years to win the ISU Grand Prix Final in Nagoya Japan  the last bigticket international competition before the  Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang PERIOD He beat Japans Shoma Uno by less than  point. with this being said I will definitely be watching his game moves and hope he has what it takes to win the Winter Olympics too PERIOD Only time will tell PERIOD

There is a strong passion for these sports in our athletes a true dedication PERIOD

And a lot of times there is a true sportsmanship between athletes based on the love they have for their sport PERIOD

They know what they need to do when to do it and how to do it while showing the world their character through it all PERIOD
