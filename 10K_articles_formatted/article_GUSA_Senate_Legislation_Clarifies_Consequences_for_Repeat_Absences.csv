The Georgetown University Student Association senate passed new legislation to standardize the organizations senator absence policy at their most recent meeting Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

The bill introduced by former Ethics and Oversight Committee Chair Zev Burton SFS  before his resignation codifies specific consequences for absences accumulated by senators throughout a session PERIOD The bill passed unanimously in the senate in a  vote but has not yet been signed by the GUSA Executive PERIOD

Under the old absence policy though three absences were grounds for impeachment the policy was not fully enforced PERIOD Under the new system the Ethics and Oversight Committee which was created in  to track senators attendance records at meetings and monitor potential conflicts of interest within GUSA may consider impeachment after a senator accrues three unexcused absences PERIOD The committee is now mandated to pursue impeachment after a senators fourth unexcused absence PERIOD

Burton resigned from the GUSA senate a day after introducing the legislation because of personal reasons and disputes within GUSA related to the ethics and oversight committee PERIOD The former vicechair of the ethics and oversight committee Chris Ziac SFS  assumed Burtons responsibilities as the current chair of the committee as of Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

The new standardized absence policy will allow operations of the senate to be more productive and benefit GUSAs mission overall Ziac said in an interview with The Hoya PERIOD

Hopefully by making this much more standard and clear people will again take it more seriously and put more effort into GUSA to foster a better environment for everybody Ziac said PERIOD I think this will not only in terms of absences but in terms of personal responsibility will hopefully get senators thinking more about taking some of the stuff more seriously and being aware of how their actions from committee or from whatever impacts the work of GUSA. the  GUSA senate saw senator absences quadruple from the previous years legislative body PERIOD Senators accumulated  unexcused absences without proxies during the term PERIOD

In terms of absences this semester the transition chair of the ethics and oversight committee Senator Leo Teixeira COL  introduced articles of impeachment against Peter Hamilton COL  after he accrued a series of unexcused absences throughout the spring and summer terms PERIOD The GUSA senate impeached Hamilton in an  vote Aug PERIOD  PERIOD However the senate later voted  not to remove Hamilton from the senate Aug PERIOD  PERIOD

The new bill aims to clarify areas of the GUSA bylaws around absences and impeachment that were previously vague or unclear according to Teixeira PERIOD

What is good about this bill I think going forward is it is going to allow for that uniformity that is much needed in various areas Teixeira said in an interview with The Hoya PERIOD It will only continue to do what the ethics and oversight committee is supposed to do which is to bring more accountability to the senate. under the new legislation a senator earning repeated unexcused absences would be required to attend meetings with various members of the ethics and oversight committee leadership as well as GUSA senate leadership depending on the number of absences accrued PERIOD

The legislation would also empower the ethics and oversight committee to recommend senators issue a public apology if they accumulate repeated absences PERIOD This measure could also however lead to disingenuous statements according to Hamilton PERIOD

I think the punishments are generally appropriate PERIOD That being said one of the suggested consequences includes requiring a senator to make a public apology Hamilton wrote in an email to The Hoya PERIOD I find requiring people to apologize to be a little over the top PERIOD I would rather an honest apology than a forced one. the ethics and oversight committee restructured the committee to include executive representatives and student body voting members at the end of October PERIOD This reform came after Teixeira led a working group over the summer to assess problems within the committee and recommend solutions PERIOD

The absence bill adheres to the ethics and oversight working groups recommendations according to Teixeira PERIOD

Part of what we pushed for is exactly whats in this bill so I will commend the bill for that for heeding the advice of the working group and the conclusions that we came up with and published Teixeira said PERIOD

Though the senator absence bill and general committee restructure were the two main reform goals of the committee for the semester Ziac also endorsed the possibility of expanding impeachment bylaw policies in the future PERIOD

The structure and absence thing were definitely the two main things that we wanted to get done as soon as possible in the session Ziac said PERIOD Ive thought about looking into specifically the impeachment process because I think the bylaws are kind of lacking on that too but thats probably a bit down the road PERIOD Hopefully it shouldnt be too important of an issue. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
