Meet the District  supervisor candidate Amy Reichert

In  best friends Zack Parker and Taylor Paul arrived in Lido Papua New Guinea in search of the perfect wave PERIOD Although the young travelers were ecstatic to find what they were looking for they were distraught by what they did not find  electricity toilets running water and real means of sanitation were not present in the beautiful underdeveloped village PERIOD Although they didnt know it at the time the young men would soon return to make longterm changes in the community PERIOD

After traveling Parker began his Master of Business Administration program at San Diego State and in Fall  was assigned to create a sustainable business plan for a class project PERIOD The povertystricken community of Lido came to his mind and with five other students Parker drafted a nonprofit business model focused on improving the sanitary conditions of coastal communities in Papua New Guinea PERIOD

However earning a good grade was not enough for the students PERIOD After dedicating hours of hard work raising money and awareness and finding their way through a bureaucratic maze their business model became a reality with the creation of Walu International in October  PERIOD

Growing up Parkers younger brother could not pronounce the word water and would ask their mother Can I have a glass of walu This family anecdote is where the name of the organization originated PERIOD Today it is Parker and his associates hope that people in underdeveloped countries have the chance to ask their loved ones if they would like a fresh glass of walu. although the founders of the organization were successful in creating a business plan focused around this idea they realized they needed some assistance to realistically implement new practices within the communities they were trying to help PERIOD In December of last year Dr PERIOD Dave Jenkins the founder of SurfAid International jumped on the Walu board as its community development consultant PERIOD

Jenkins helped us formulate an overall operational strategy Parker said PERIOD  Behavior change takes years and he taught us how to slow down and do things correctly the first time PERIOD Just having the locals build something isnt the problem having them learn how to use it is the problem. jenkins suggested beginning with the single village of Lido as a trial and error site to formulate a community development plan that could be successfully repeated in other areas PERIOD Walus current plan is called Communityled Total Sanitation. we train local people to be the liaison between our organization and the village Parker said PERIOD Were in the community every day but when it comes time to give presentations its local people who present issues and motivate the community. with help from Jenkins and locals Walu recently set up  unsubsidized handwashing stations in Lido in less than a month PERIOD The team hopes this new development will dampen the prevalence of cholera an infection in the small intestine causing severe diarrhea within the community PERIOD According to the Walu website one in six children die in Papua New Guinea every year because of diseases similar to cholera and about  percent of these deaths could be prevented with better sanitation practices PERIOD

In the future Parker hopes Walu International will be at the top of the nonprofit water sanitation and hygiene industry PERIOD Its next project within the U.S PERIOD will be a monthly donation campaign established to show it gives a crap by raising money so people in less privileged parts of the world have access to a toilet PERIOD The campaign will kick off with a fundraiser event May  at Bar West in Pacific Beach PERIOD To find out more information about Walu visit waluinternational.org or check out the organizations Facebook page at facebook.comwaluinternational",Walu idea offers villages a cleaner reality  â€“ The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
