Observer Scene  Monday November  

The idea of the cartoon family the Simpsons performing MacBeth might strike Shakespeare purists as a travesty of a great work.They should keep in mind that part of the genius of Shakespeare lay in entertaining the peanut gallery while still capturing the human spirit PERIOD MacHomer undoubtedly turned the great tragedy into a comedy but the performance was far from being an insult to the play PERIOD The play has to be taken with a grain of salt but actor and author Rick Miller generally maintained a consciousness of the original words of Shakespeare PERIOD The interpretation even made the characters seem more human by relating them to wellknown characters closer to the modern understanding PERIOD Shakespeare was pop culture back then Miller said PERIOD I dont think Shakespeare is rolling over in his grave PERIOD I think he would have preferred this to a bloated overacted performance of MacBeth.Since Miller played every character in the fastpaced rendition of MacBeth himself it is hard to judge his potential for more serious indepth acting PERIOD He does have an astounding ability for impersonation PERIOD Homer and Marge were more than recognizable but not his best performances PERIOD Other characters were spoton.Barney Gumble is Millers favorite character to perform and probably his best impersonation PERIOD Barney as MacDuff is tragically human especially for devoted fans of the television show PERIOD The biggest problem might be that after watching MacHomer it will be difficult to watch a more traditional performance and not be reminded of Barney.Theres something very pathetic about Barney PERIOD He has the soul of an artist but hes thwarted by alcohol and Homer Miller said PERIOD He makes the role of MacDuff have a pathos to it.Millers choice of Abe Simpson Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Otto Mann to play the murderers sent after Banquo and his son was also inspired PERIOD The dynamic trio was beautifully incompetent and put a comprehensible face on some of the minor characters that often fall between the cracks in readings and performances of Shakespeare PERIOD Millers portrayal of Otto might have come directly from the show and the dropout bus driver fit memorably with the clueless doctor turned murder PERIOD Just like with Barney it will be hard to watch the escape of Banquos son in any performance without picturing Otto saying Oh man we lost the little dude.Miller has had great success performing MacHomer for high school students and it is easy to see way PERIOD Kings and lords and antiquated language can seem pretty far removed from a modernday classroom but Marge and Homer are part of everyday life PERIOD Miller tries to perform for a school at every other stop on his annual spring and fall tours.I ask the students who doesnt get Shakespeare and usually about half of them raise their hands Miller said PERIOD They dont get theyre afraid in a way PERIOD But if the same words come through say Moe the bartender they get the same words.Miller has tentative plans to open MacHomer as an offBroadway play in May  which will be his tenth year performing the show PERIOD Although he is pleased by the success of his show it has taken him by surprise.You start playing houses with  seats and selling out and its strange to think wow this is just my little trick Miller said.But its a welldone trick and a trick with a ready and enthusiastic audience PERIOD It is also a unique trick in the neverending field of trying to find new ways to interpret Shakespeare.Miller is correct in saying Shakespeare himself very well might have enjoyed MacHomer. and even if he would not Miller can fall back on the fact that thousands of audience members do PERIOD
