I came to Missoula three years ago after graduating high school and spending the summer delivering pizzas in an N95 mask PERIOD My family drove up to Missoula to help me move into Knowles Hall PERIOD None of us were sure how far Id make it into my freshman year before a COVID19 outbreak would inevitably shut the world down again PERIOD

The first people who greeted me when I arrived on campus Montana Kaimin reporters PERIOD They captured my uncertainty for the future and the first issue that ran when I became a UM student featured me on the cover carrying my cello on my back into my new home PERIOD

The Kaimin made me feel seen and my goal from then on was doing the same for my peers PERIOD Since then Ive worked as a news reporter and news editor and I couldnt be more grateful to lead the passionate group of students here at the Kaimin next year PERIOD

Ive spent my time at the Kaimin reporting the news that affects everyone living and working on this campus and our team will continue keeping our readers updated with important stories PERIOD Our team is united to highlight students struggles and triumphs and we strive to include all voices in our coverage PERIOD

UM has truly come to life since I moved here in  but those memories of harnessing connection in spite of the distance will never leave me PERIOD Were a resilient bunch here in Missoula and Im overjoyed to continue sharing stories of fellow students bringing energy to everything they do here at the University PERIOD

I cant wait to get to work next semester PERIOD
