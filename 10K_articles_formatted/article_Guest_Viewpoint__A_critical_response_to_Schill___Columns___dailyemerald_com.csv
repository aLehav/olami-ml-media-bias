Strange it is that men should admit the validity of the arguments for free speech but object to their being pushed to an extreme not seeing that unless the reasons are good for an extreme case they are not good for any case. john Stuart Mill

University of Oregon President Michael Schill was quick to dismiss the protesters of his Oct PERIOD  State of the University Address on the grounds that they dont understand the value of free speech. while I believe he may be wellmeaning in his desire to teach all of our students and members of the community the value of free speech and tolerance Schill fails to acknowledge the defect in his fundamental misunderstanding regarding freedom of speech PERIOD Namely he ignores the fact that speech is tied to access PERIOD It is strange that Schill who has the loudest voice on campus and multiple platforms at his disposal can claim that his rights and freedoms are being infringed upon while others voices are being silenced PERIOD

Marginalized students dont have a voice on campus but Schill was able to post a statement on the school website release a video and directly email all students regarding his speech PERIOD He also swung private conversations where  million suddenly appeared out of midair  conversations that didnt include student voices PERIOD Students dont typically have access to platforms and forums for speech sanctioned by the university and this needs to change PERIOD

This newspaper is one exception of course but the Daily Emerald also gives a fairly large and consistent voice to Schill PERIOD The insidiousness of his statements regarding free speech particularly his remark that protesters dont want to listen actually undermines constructive dialogue on this campus by stifling any further discussion PERIOD I am not one of the protesters but I support them PERIOD

Demeaning the Oct PERIOD  protesters by comparing them to the Black Student Task Force is frankly ahistorical PERIOD The university didnt listen to Black students until they protested PERIOD Protest is a fundamental expression of free speech and needs to be protected as a student right on campus  especially when the administration disagrees with it PERIOD

In addition as I understand it the primary reason students are frustrated is because the university administration the Board of Trustees and the budget and resource planning officials dont want to include students in discussions and decisions regarding the allocation of university funds nor effectively tackle the rising cost of tuition PERIOD This is in addition to other issues which directly affect students PERIOD

Hopefully Schill recognizes his mistake and gives a greater voice to students in keeping with his respect for speech and debate PERIOD This would be better in my opinion than trying to pacify us with magic money that is mostly allocated towards science and technology accompanying Schills interests like the Knight campus project PERIOD Many students want to be involved in our schools decisions but dont have access to create dialogue about it PERIOD If the university receives a mysterious  million donation we want to be involved in the conversation PERIOD

One way Schill can give students a greater voice is to include us in decisionmaking processes that are about us PERIOD Including student voices in conversations about the budget will prove enlightening allaround as we have a lot to talk about PERIOD There is a lack of financial transparency at the university PERIOD For example most students dont know how the increase in tuition is related to Direct Subsidized Loans Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Federal Pell Grants PERIOD Seems to me this money goes straight into the universitys coffers before being allocated and disbursed to students and rises directly proportionate to the cost of tuition PERIOD Schills comment that students can borrow money to pay for the increase suggests that tuition increases might be being used to increase lending money rather than to directly tackle costs PERIOD Why cant we create a balanced budget and reduce our costs There are plenty of brilliant students here just itching to help in that endeavor PERIOD

I look forward to learning about our freedoms and I hope that the student voice is integral to Schills upcoming lectures PERIOD
