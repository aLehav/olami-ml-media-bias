2777,2008-04-01,"once again its Election Day and once again we urge you in the strongest terms possible to exercise your democratic right and get out to the polls PERIOD But dont stop reading here because with the twin debacles of the District  Dane County Board and state Supreme Court races things are a little different today PERIOD

Excising the Frankenstein veto which currently allows the governor to stitch together unrelated words and numbers in budgetary legislation is a worthy and sufficient reason to vote PERIOD But we cannot endorse anyone for the contested races on the rest of the District  ballot PERIOD

In the County Board race this is simply because both Wyndham Manning and Conor OHagan have yet to prove they are fit for office PERIOD Between Mr PERIOD OHagans frankly alarming Economic Development Plan and Mr PERIOD Mannings inability to reason out much beyond an arts and lakecleanup program District  deserves better in a time when the County Board is trying to sell voters on a  million Regional Transit Authority PERIOD

It is not the qualifications of the state Supreme Court candidates that give us pause but the retread of last years mudslinging between interest groups over Justice Annette Ziegler and opponent Linda Clifford PERIOD To endorse either Burnett County Judge Michael Gableman or incumbent Justice Louis Butler would be to implicitly endorse a judicial selection process that by its very nature cannot engender substantive debate PERIOD Justices should be held to their experience and recommendation of their peers not elected on a trumpedup ideological bent PERIOD

In elections without a national race to pique the average citizens interest voter turnout usually plummets which is why its all the more essential to make your voice heard PERIOD Sure cliches like every vote counts lose their potency when theyre trotted out every few months but far better that than the caveats this election has forced upon this board PERIOD While most students ballots will have three contested items on it we cannot in good conscience encourage anything but a yes vote on the Frankenstein referendum PERIOD
