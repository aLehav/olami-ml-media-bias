8737,2023-06-14,"over  students and faculty gathered in Urban Plaza Square to protest Portland States inefficient management of funds as well as to raise awareness about the decisions in campuswide budget cuts affecting faculty students and staff PERIOD Portland State University American Association of University Professors PSU AAUP Portland State University Faculty Association and social science students planned the June  event to last from  p.m. just outside the Rec Center where the Board of Trustees were meeting with the Finance  Administration Committee PERIOD



The budget cuts were a result of declining enrollment PERIOD As of May  upwards of  adjunct professors had reported notifications of contract nonrenewals according to PSU AAUPs webpage titled Deep Cuts Cause Chaos on Campus. this is in addition to departmentwide course reductions particularly for summer classes PERIOD



The PSU AAUP whose demands can be found on their website are protesting the stress of the budget cuts on students faculty and staffcausing among other things increasingly unsustainable workloads difficulty with graduating on time rescinded research opportunities and nonrenewed contracts of adjunct faculty PERIOD



When asked to explain what happened in the June  Finance  Administration meeting with the Board of Trustees in relation to the management reserves Amy Mulkerinthe Vice Provost for Academic Budget and Planningsaid that in order to support the gap in the Education  General EG budget they had to allocate  million from the management reserve PERIOD



In recent years the board has utilized the management reserve both to support that gap and for planned strategic uses at the unit level. things have changed this year however PERIOD



We need to include those other planned uses in the EG budget rather than reserves Mulkerin said PERIOD



Recorded livestreams and slideshows from board meetings can be found on the boards website at www.pdx.eduboard PERIOD



Several participants shared their disappointment in the word that a  million startup fund had been set aside for Incoming President Ann Cudd as referenced on flyers distributed by the PSU AAUP PERIOD



While it is up to PSU to decide how to allocate those funds I dont appreciate how they have this really huge price tag at the top while simultaneously cutting on the bottom said Sam Morehouse a political science student PERIOD If its such a high number that they need to be making cuts then I think its too high. in an email from the Media Relations Manager at University Communications Katy Swordfisk however an official statement from the university denied such a fund exists PERIOD



There has been no  million start up budget set aside for Incoming President Ann Cudd or any other purpose we are adhering to all elements of the collective bargaining agreements PSU has in place with its unions the university said in the statement PERIOD



The statement also mentioned that the university is working to reduce current funding by  in light of its declining enrollment PERIOD Their current priorities are on increasing enrollment and seeking funding support PERIOD



I know a lot of people who have had to extend their plans for graduation or come up with extra money because of the sudden cancellation of summer classes said Chris Hill a political science masters student PERIOD People were already registered for the summer had adjusted their work to align with their schedules but are now panicking making new plans for the summer. peggy Maxey a political science MSundergrad student first became aware of the budget cuts upon finding out that her political theory professor Nathan Gies job was atrisk PERIOD Noting how much of an asset he was to both his students and the university she started a petition called Save Dr PERIOD Gies in an effort to save his job PERIOD



Dr PERIOD Gies was originally hired as a temporary replacement for the previous political theory professor who never came back Maxey said PERIOD He has a PhD in political science with an expertise in political theory from Johns Hopkins PERIOD No other professor here specializes in political theory so if we lost him the department would suffer. gies himself reported hearing rumors about the budget cuts before learning on May  via his department chair Joshua Eastin that the futures of the position he was filling in for and that of political theory were uncertain PERIOD



What was initially questioning my position for next year and beyond turned out to be worse than I thought Gies said PERIOD Political theory being in question raises concerns for our graduate PAP and MPP programs as I feel theyre all interconnected. political Science Department Chair Joshua Eastin explained that he feels strongly against the impact these reductions and limitations have had on his department PERIOD



We had initially proposed offering eight summer courses but the Deans office had whittled that down to five Eastin said PERIOD Those were on the schedule people were registering for them. thats when the Board of Trustees made the decision to stop using the management reserve for specific usage at the unit level PERIOD It eliminated our flexibility to fill these budgetary gaps and we were lucky to even be able to offer the one upper division class for this summer term Eastin said PERIOD



When asked about Gies situation Eastin explained that he spoke to the Deans office to figure out how to come up with the money to find pay and hire a new political theorist but in this budgetary environment I just dont think its going to be possible PERIOD So its been very demoralizing for us. he then went on to say that despite these challenges hes still optimistic about political science and their ability to offer courses that students rely onbut without a political theorist to support that component of their program the department will be lacking in some capacity PERIOD



Apart from impacts in regards to course projections PSUs Viking Cheer Program joined the protest on June  as they were also majorly affected by the universitywide budget cuts PERIOD



According to their petition on Change.orgcalled Save Portland State Universitys Cheer ProgramLeah Thyne the Associate Athletic Director quietly sent them an email on June  stating that they decided to pause the cheer program for the  season based on a variety of factors including budget constraints due to significant cuts to athletics. their petition also states that the Viking Cheer Program has been the one to fundraise money each year to fund their transportation to and participation in competitions PERIOD They have also had to pay out of pocket for cheer shoes camps food and transportation to games PERIOD



The money allocated to them by PSU Athletics was put toward paying some coaching staff with the rest being volunteers due to their minimal budget PERIOD



Ultimately Gies said the protested issue lies within the lack of transparency in the universitys decisionmaking process PERIOD



Listen to the people who are affected and genuinely involve them in the process rather than just announcing decisions to them and then forcing all of us to scramble to figure out what that means for us Gies said PERIOD We have an idea of shared governance but things like this make it seem like thats not happening. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
