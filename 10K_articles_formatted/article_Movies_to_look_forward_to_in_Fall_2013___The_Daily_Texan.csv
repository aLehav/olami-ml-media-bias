 Years a Slave

Steve McQueen is one of the most measured compelling young directors working today and his strong sense of restrained style should be interesting when applied to the true story of Solomon Northup Chiwetel Ejiofor a free AfricanAmerican man whos abducted and sold into slavery in the South PERIOD Frequent McQueen collaborator Michael Fassbender who gave his best performance in Shame McQueens last film returns as Northups brutal owner PERIOD The rest of the ensemble includes Brad Pitt Paul Giamatti and Paul Dano and the film should be one of the most shattering works of the year PERIOD

No filmmaker has such a finely tuned sense of time and place as the Coen brothers and this exploration of the New York music scene in the 1960s earned rave reviews at the Cannes Film Festival PERIOD The Coens last musically inclined film O Brother Where Art Thou was one of their most strange but endearing works and TBone Burnett has returned to do the music for Inside Llewyn Davis along with cast member John Goodman PERIOD Goodman is joined by Oscar Issac Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake several performers whose sensibilities should pair nicely with the Coens sense of humor and melancholy PERIOD
