8328,2023-10-25,"part of me wants to vomit for writing an article on Justin Bieber but I also find it equally nauseating to pass up an opportunity to highlight the absurd state of American pop culture PERIOD

Bieber after a tour in Europe is to take a paternity test to verify that he is not the father of Mariah Yeaters baby PERIOD Yeaters legal team is happy about Biebers willingness to take the test but what is supposed to come of this Im going to jump the gun and point out that Bieber is probably not the father of this child no surprise there PERIOD

The point of this is clearly publicity although there doesnt seem to be much of a payout from publicity unless you get your own reality TV show legal settlement or the like PERIOD Whos to gain from such bogus claims that Bieber impregnated this woman Obviously pop culture media has profit to gain from readership PERIOD

Whether or not any stories printed in the tabloids have merit becomes irrelevant when there are famous faces attached to them PERIOD Certain individuals want to buy magazines about famous people but why That seems to be a more difficult question to answer PERIOD

What I know for certain is that there are complaints everywhere about the substance of the news magazines and other media print or otherwise PERIOD Of course people place the blame on the media as a whole but perhaps there is not enough blame placed on readership PERIOD If you are more inclined to read about Biebers baby mama than the Greek debt crisis you could be part of the substance problem PERIOD

Of course where there is a demand that demand will be met PERIOD What is more pressing than the issue of substance in media sensationalism isnt exactly new is the lack of awareness about the issue PERIOD We can bandy about biased reporting but when it comes down to it people simply arent willing to change their demands or they dont care enough to change or they simply dont understand the impact of their demand PERIOD

In turn the problem is perpetuated through a series of articles concerning sensational rumors and halftruths in order to garner the attention of the masses PERIOD It works and nothing is gained but profit for some pretty substanceless news sources PERIOD

The rumors are perpetuated whether they are true or not PERIOD Journalists arent lying theyre bullshitting. the lauded philosopher Harry Frankfurt describes the phenomenon as having no concern for the truth but instead has a motive other than perpetuating an untruth which is exactly what pop culture media is fond of printing and what the public loves to hear PERIOD

It appears we have a bullshit problem PERIOD Bieber in this case seems to be a proponent of the truth so cheers to you Bieber

As for the media for Yeater and for the general public there seems to be too much allowance of bullshitting which is the real culprit in the fight for substance in media PERIOD

Michael Dearman is a sophomore majoring in English political science and philosophy he would also like to add that he hates bullshit PERIOD He can be reached for comment at emailprotected
