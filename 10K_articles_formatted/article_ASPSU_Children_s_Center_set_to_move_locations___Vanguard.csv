8733,2023-03-15,"associated Students of Portland State University ASPSU Childrens Center will be moving into the Helen Gordon Child Development Center building come fall  PERIOD Jose Coll Ph PERIOD D. interim dean of the College of Education made the decision in response to campuswide budget cuts due to low enrollment PERIOD



The move came to the attention of ASPSU Center families and staff by way of a premature announcement in the College of Education newsletter sent to faculty and staff the last week of February PERIOD The announcement detailed that the change of physical space would occur in spring of  PERIOD Families and staff at the center immediately expressed concern regarding the lack of involvement in the decisionmaking process along with the short notice drafting a petition which as of March  has received over  signatures from PSU staff alumni and students PERIOD



Dr PERIOD Coll later followed up with an email detailing in more specificity the goals and desires behind the decision along with an apology for the lack of transparency PERIOD



It was an unfortunate miscommunication that as dean I take full responsibility Coll said PERIOD In order to respond like we did with our letter it takes time to think about one what are the concerns by our community or the concerns of faculty and staff What are the concerns of students



Dr PERIOD Coll with assistance from Lynn Green director of the Helen Gordon Center pushed the move date back after staff and family concerns arose regarding the effects of a midschool year disruption on the children PERIOD The move date for the ASPSU Center is now set for fall  with the transition happening over the summer while kids are out of school PERIOD



The ASPSU Center is currently located in the Smith Memorial Student Union SMSU building PERIOD The Helen Gordon Center oversees the ASPSU Center though each has their own program coordinator and operates with a different system PERIOD No changes will be made to the structure of the ASPSU Centers program with the move which will allow families to continue under the lower cost of the ASPSU Center and the opendoor policy that welcomes parents to checkin and spend time with their kids throughout the day PERIOD



The relocation would move it inside the same building as its parent organization the Helen Gordon Center which is six blocks east of SMSU on the corner of Southwest twelfth Avenue and Market Street PERIOD



I made the decision based on the data that was collected by Lynn Green to help me process Dr PERIOD Coll said PERIOD This is one of those moments that I had an opportunity to say this is the best way for us to create sustainability PERIOD The best way for us to serve a larger community is by bringing these two units together instead of continuing the kind of separation even though theyre within the same umbrella. for some however the change of location will make a difference PERIOD Adriana Garcia a PSU Honors College student and mother of four with one kid at the ASPSU Center said that moving locations will make an already tricky schedule increasingly difficult PERIOD



Its a big leap for me to be back in school again Garcia said PERIOD Im juggling one in college one in high school one in preschool and you know without ASPSU in Smithlike thats the central location PERIOD Im able to drop them off Im able to run to class PERIOD Its just perfect. martn Alberto Gonzalez an assistant professor at PSU in Chicano Latino Studies and his partner Jessica Ramirez an adjunct professor in Social Work take their daughter to the ASPSU Center PERIOD Gonzalez expressed concern over the structural differences in regards to race between the ASPSU Center and the Helen Gordon Center PERIOD He recalled first walking into the ASPSU Center and noticing right away that a majority of teachers were people of color and feeling an overwhelming sense of support for his Chicana daughter to be there PERIOD



How is it that an already marginalized center with predominantly teachers of color and students of color is further being marginalized Gonzalez said PERIOD For us that is a very important point of contention that hasnt been taken into consideration PERIOD What happens when you put these teachers of color into a predominantly white space If a space appears diverse how does that space operate



Other parents expressed similar concerns stating a conscious choice to join the ASPSU Center because of its racially affirming makeup PERIOD The Helen Gordon Center has a predominantly white staff though its director Green has a background in diversity receiving the Presidents Diversity Award during the  academic year PERIOD Green did not respond to Portland State Vanguard in time for comments before the articles publication date PERIOD



Green set up two Zoom meetings to discuss changes with ASPSU Center families and staffthough many were unable to attend because of conflicts in schedule and the times occuring during the centers open hours PERIOD Families are currently working with staff to propose a selection of dates to Green for discussing the move that works with both family and staff schedules PERIOD



This is the time for us in leadership and as a community to make very difficult decisions and to be able to reshape the university to meet the needs of our students and our community at large Dr PERIOD Coll said PERIOD
