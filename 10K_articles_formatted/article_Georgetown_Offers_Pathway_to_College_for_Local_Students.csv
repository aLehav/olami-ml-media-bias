Alexis Yeager COL  first heard about Georgetown in ninth grade PERIOD That was the year she joined the Institute for College Preparation a program that helps lowincome Washington D.C PERIOD students navigate college applications within Georgetowns Center for Multicultural Equity and Access PERIOD

Without the ICP Yeager is unsure if she would have enrolled in college PERIOD Like many other lowincome students in the District Yeager was filled with doubt about how her socioeconomic status would translate in the eyes of college admission officers PERIOD

I joined the program when I was in ninth grade Yeager said PERIOD Before that I wasnt even thinking about college PERIOD I wanted to go to college but I was not sure if it was feasible given my situation at home PERIOD 

Yeagers brother went to H.D PERIOD Woodson High School which primarily serves students in Ward  an area in Southeast D.C PERIOD with historically lowincome neighborhoods PERIOD

Yeager herself attended School Without Walls in Foggy Bottom PERIOD A public magnet school Walls offers special instruction and programs unavailable elsewhere designed to attract a more diverse student body from across its school district PERIOD

But even with this resource at her disposal Georgetown was not on Yeagers radar PERIOD

I dont know if Georgetown really reached out to people in my high school Yeager said PERIOD

Georgetown takes pride in its D.C PERIOD location citing its position in the nations capital as an asset for prospective students on its admission website PERIOD Yet of the  D.C PERIOD residents who applied to Georgetowns class of   enrolled this fall PERIOD D.C PERIOD residents represent just over one percent of the 1622person freshman class PERIOD Talented students who grew up in the District comprise a small component of Georgetowns community due to accessibility obstacles for students from poorer wards PERIOD

Programs like the ICP seek to mitigate these barriers to applying by making higher education institutions like Georgetown more accessible to students living in the local community PERIOD

Pipeline to Access

Georgetowns outreach to the D.C PERIOD community aims to empower students primarily from Wards  and  to see the benefits of a postsecondary education PERIOD ICP constitutes one of several Georgetown initiatives which aim to improve its recruitment efforts in the District PERIOD

The ICP works with a cohort of around  students from middle schools in Ward  PERIOD Starting in seventh grade these precollege scholars come to Georgetowns campus every Saturday to attend classes so they are prepared for college by the time they graduate high school PERIOD

In addition to this Saturday Academy CMEA takes ICP participants on college tours PERIOD The creation of the D.C PERIOD Tuition Assistance Grant allows D.C PERIOD residents to attend any public college or university for the cost of instate tuition PERIOD This Districtsponsored initiative has expanded CMEA tours to include not only nearby schools on the East Coast but also state schools in the Midwest PERIOD

The ICP aims to get middle and high school students who attend targeted D.C PERIOD public schools interested in all postsecondary educational opportunities not just Georgetown according to Executive Director Charlene BrownMcKenzie PERIOD

The goal is to inspire interest and hope in higher education BrownMcKenzie who also serves as CMEA director said PERIOD Thats the ICP piece PERIOD It is about inspiring the possibilities of college access broadly PERIOD It is not a pipeline feeder to Georgetown. in addition to the ICP the CMEA runs two other outreach programs in the D.C PERIOD community to engage with lowincome students and prepare them for the possibility of attending college PERIOD

Each spring student volunteers from Georgetown University teach a curriculum focusing on college and career preparation to sixth graders for six to eight weeks with a campus visit at the end of the program PERIOD

Georgetown continues to run Kids2College a program aimed to make students aware of the viable option of attending college immediately after high school BrownMcKenzie said PERIOD

We are probably the only institution in the D.C PERIOD area that continues doing the Kids2College program BrownMcKenzie said PERIOD Why Because of the bestpractice literature PERIOD The literature says you start early PERIOD You start early and you start often. georgetown also participates in the College ExposureDual Enrollment Program which allows high school seniors from local public schools to enroll in courses at their local university  in this case Georgetown  for free PERIOD

Georgetown is committed to spreading awareness of college opportunities to the local community that may not otherwise engage with the university according to BrownMcKenzie PERIOD

It is our hope that we will continue to have the institutional support to really allow this to be a true gateway to postsecondary education for communities that would not normally have this opportunity BrownMcKenzie said PERIOD We are just one part of the education sector. programs at the Center for Social Justice  including its academic tutoring and English mentorship programs like After School Kids and D.C PERIOD Schools Project  reinforce CMEAs goals PERIOD

I think with the work that especially the ASK program the D.C PERIOD Schools Project is doing in our immigrant communities they are seeing more and more messaging around Georgetown in the community BrownMcKenzie said PERIOD

Homegrown Admissions

For Talhia Tuck Georgetowns associate director of admissions reaching out to D.C PERIOD schools is a personal priority PERIOD Raised in the District Tuck said her passion to provide greater access for local public school students stems from her grandmother who taught in D.C PERIOD public schools PERIOD

The decision for D.C PERIOD residents to apply to local colleges requires a tailored recruiting approach from admissions according to Tuck PERIOD

Having grown up in D.C. Im aware of the fact that they might have a different perspective because they are right here in the same place that Georgetown is PERIOD So I do think that students who are local might look at the decision to stay or leave in a different way Tuck said PERIOD I try to start by talking about what I loved about D.C PERIOD and how being a student in D.C PERIOD in college is going to be different than their experience in high school. georgetown recognizes the importance of involving Districtbased families to ensure its students success PERIOD As a result BrownMcKenzie said the university makes sure its precollege programs reach the wider support network of these lowincome students PERIOD For families the ICP offers a series of parent engagement workshops PERIOD

Similarly anyone who participates in Kids2College a program for sixth graders is automatically invited  funding permitted  to join the ICP a program for seventh graders and above PERIOD

Its not just a one time one shot deal BrownMckenzie said PERIOD

The institute has seen immense success according to BrownMcKenzie PERIOD One hundred percent of students from the class of  went on to postsecondary education including twoyear and fouryear institutions PERIOD

We have historically achieved extraordinarily high graduation rates that far exceed that of the local schools and we continue to do so BrownMcKenzie said PERIOD

In fall  the ICP welcomed its new cohort of students from partner middle schools in Ward  including Parkside Middle School John Philip Sousa Middle School and Kelly Miller Middle School PERIOD ICP adopts a new cohort of approximately  lowincome students every five or six years once their previous class has graduated PERIOD The most recent cohort of students is on track to graduate high school in  and college in  PERIOD

BrownMcKenzie is optimistic about the future of the program as it continues to evolve and expand such as through study abroad opportunities for ICP participants PERIOD

The District is becoming so much more global and poor folks across the river arent able to access what that means BrownMcKenzie said PERIOD So we build in a study abroad component at no cost to the student PERIOD Again not perfect but for me its one of the options that allows Georgetown to really be a special place PERIOD Can we do more Of course. for Yeager no background or income status should prevent local students seeking out university opportunities PERIOD She encouraged D.C PERIOD high school students to apply despite concerns they might have PERIOD

If youre thinking about Georgetown dont be afraid to apply Yeager said PERIOD Dont get caught up in the preconceived notions you might have about a predominantly white institution or identity because on Georgetowns campus theres definitely a community for everybody. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
