491,2016-09-23,"getting tired of wearing the same outfit to every single game Ive curated a few essentials that make it easy to pull a quick outfit together that shows pride for the U and includes a bit of your own style PERIOD

The Us colors are red black and gray which should work for your blouse tee or tanktop depending on if its a black out game or not PERIOD Here are a few layers and bottom pieces to wear besides overworn jeans if you want to switch things up PERIOD

Many of you in the MUSS may be wearing a red top if you bought your season pass ahead of time PERIOD Those who arent in the MUSS however have a bit more freedom with color choices PERIOD Consider your top when pairing it with the bottom pieces Ive given as your inspired choices PERIOD

LADIES

When wearing a red black or gray top keep in mind the look you are going for like classic relaxed preppy girly edgy eclectic or bohemian style PERIOD

After you find the top you want to wear find a bottom piece that furthers your style choice by browsing below PERIOD

CLASSIC

Are you going on a date or feel like dressing up for the game in case you go out afterwards If you want to stay classic and on trend pair your top with a buttonfront skirt PERIOD This is a fun way to make your look more girly without going overboard PERIOD Keep it classy with a denim or black buttonfront skirt as both stood the test of time PERIOD

LAID BACK

Try overalls if your style is more laid back PERIOD Overalls are making a comeback from the 90s and more and more people have been seen wearing them especially among students PERIOD Denim overalls make a perfect casual staple to your outfit leave one side unbuttoned for an even more relaxed look PERIOD

PREPPY

If youre going for something along the lines of preppy pair your top with shorts and tights PERIOD Fall is approaching and that means chillier game nights PERIOD Wearing a pair of tights with shorts can keep your legs from freezing during games PERIOD

GUYS

Guys you may not have as many options as the ladies but you still have some to choose from so dont revert to those jeans you wear to every game either PERIOD You never know who youll run into at the concession stands PERIOD

GRUNGEROCK

If youre going for a bit of a grungy look pair your top with ripped up jeans PERIOD Black jeans with rips near the knee give a subtleedgy vibe PERIOD Adding a leather jacket completes the look if edge is what youre looking for PERIOD

CASUAL

Being casual is an easy thing to accomplish by wearing a pair of light wash jeans PERIOD The light wash of the jeans maybe a nice change from your usual medium wash jeans giving off a clean casual appearance PERIOD These are seen worn with Converse but maybe mix things up a bit and wear high top sneakers from a different brand for more individuality PERIOD

SPORTY

Whats a sports game without sports attire Maybe youd rather wear some sporty sweats or running shorts PERIOD Perhaps you have a jersey you like PERIOD Go for it Just as long as you havent worked out in it right before  that may prevent you from making friends with those around you PERIOD

ESSENTIALS

One vital essential for football games is a jacket PERIOD You can never go wrong with bringing along a jacket especially when theres a chance of rain PERIOD Tie it around your waist if it gets too warm PERIOD Jackets in a neutral shade are the easiest to layer with as they match almost anything PERIOD

Say NO to flip flops and sandals and say YES to tennis shoes boots and flats PERIOD Why If you havent already noticed crowds of people mixed with cheering can cause some damage PERIOD To avoid potentially hurting your feet wear shoes that cover your toes PERIOD You wont regret the decision when youre walking back to the TRAX station or your car PERIOD

Remember to take a small purse or a wallet that can hold a few essentials such as your drivers license student ID ticket phone some cash for snacks and water and whatever else you think you may need such as sunglasses and lip balm PERIOD

One last thing dont forget to show some pride for the U by accessorizing or adding face paint to your look PERIOD

See you out there
