The Dailys Opinions section is excited to introduce Frankly Speaking a weekly column that has community members weigh in on pressing campus news and debates PERIOD

Heres how it will work Every week we will release a debateworthy question on Monday PERIOD We will accept 250word max responses to the question from readers until Saturday of the same week PERIOD Then we will choose a few particularly incisive submissions to be published in the next weeks Monday paper PERIOD

Our hope is for Frankly Speaking to extend discourse and debate on important subjects beyond Daily staffers and to put voices from across campus in conversation with each other PERIOD We want to hear from students across disciplines and social identities about their unique takes on the controversial topics and vital realities we confront as an institution PERIOD

Our main criteria for selecting responses are clarity creativity and persuasiveness PERIOD We encourage you to draw on personal expertise and experience as you justify a stance PERIOD

Our first question is

To what extent is getting admitted into Stanford a result of privilege

Please submit your responses via Google Forms here PERIOD

Responses are due by  p.m PERIOD on Saturday April   PERIOD

Contextual information you might consider Stanford is under Department of Justice investigation for its part in a college admissions scandal in which students were admitted to universities through bribes falsified credentials and cheating on admissions tests PERIOD Most recently Stanford expelled a student with falsified sailing credentials PERIOD Before this they changed their athlete recruitment policy while confronting a Department of Education probe into how the Universitys financial aid mechanisms may have facilitated bribery PERIOD In local news several Bay Area parents have been charged for using illegal means to get their children admitted into colleges PERIOD In light of this scandal some commentators have argued that the scandal is simply a manifestation of how the college admissions process favors students from privileged backgrounds PERIOD We want to know what you make of this perspective PERIOD

If you have any questions or concerns please email emailprotected PERIOD

We look forward to hearing from you
