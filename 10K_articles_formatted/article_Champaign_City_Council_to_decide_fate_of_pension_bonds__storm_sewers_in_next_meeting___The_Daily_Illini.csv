2455,2023-10-26,"champaign City Council will decide whether pension obligation bonds are a possible solution to the citys financial problems PERIOD After their regular meeting on Tuesday night the council will hold a study session to discuss these bonds PERIOD

Pension obligation bonds are an alternative to cutting costs in the budget PERIOD The method could potentially reduce the citys annual contributions to the pension funds by issuing debt PERIOD A loan would pay the citys fire and police pension which would allow a lesser portion of that to come from the citys budget PERIOD

Savings from the bonds would reduce future budget reductions and future reductions to some of the citys service positions such as fire and police PERIOD

However according to city documents Champaign administrators will recommend that the council discontinue consideration of pension obligation bonds because of the potential financial risks PERIOD Other risks include investment risk loss of flexibility extending a term of debt and the potential for increased cost of future debts PERIOD

The council approved the budget reduction proposals last January which included some reduction in city staff PERIOD During that meeting members of the council expressed no interest in putting a long term deficit on the city by borrowing money PERIOD



Marci Dodds District  council member said she is not in favor of the bonds PERIOD

In other council business a second set of bids and loans will be presented for the John Street watershed project PERIOD The current watershed ranks as one of the top three worst flooding areas in the city PERIOD Heavy rainfall has caused hundreds of basement and surface flooding complaints PERIOD

A stormwater plan conducted in  concluded that the 33inch storm sewer is unable to keep up with the stormwater produced by heavy rains and that it is one of the major factors contributing to watershed flooding PERIOD

The goal of the drainage improvement project is to reduce flooding frequency and raise the flood protection level from a 1year storm level to a 40year storm level PERIOD
