7217,2023-10-31,"breaking news Taylor Swift is rumored to be dating Travis Kelce tight end on the Kansas City Chiefs whose brother plays for the Philadelphia Eagles and blah blah blah blah PERIOD As a huge Taylor Swift fan I am here to admit that Im tired of listening to every person on the planet talk about this new romance involving Swift PERIOD

To me it feels like more people are concerned with Swifts love life than they are with her actual career which by the way could not be more successful than at this moment PERIOD Swifts Eras Tour has been one of the most highly demanded tours by fans topping  billion in sales the first concert to ever reach this amount PERIOD In fact The New York Times has recently published an article about Swifts and Beyoncs tour stating how Swifts concert could create around . billion in economic activity in North America alone PERIOD Taylor Swift is literally helping our economy from her tour with each city having an economic boom after she visited PERIOD Lets also note Swifts Eras Tour movie which has reached number one at the box office giving fans the opportunity to enjoy her concert in a literal movie theater PERIOD Plus Swift is releasing  Taylors Version on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD  was one of the most influential pop albums to hit the charts and one of her most streamed albums PERIOD Therefore it is easy to assume that her Taylors Version will dominate the charts the same way PERIOD With all this in mind it only makes me wonder why people are purely focusing on her relationships rather than her actual career PERIOD

In many cases people use celebrities relationships as an escape PERIOD I can understand why people find excitement and intrigue when it comes to celebrities love lives but when we put that in front of their literal career then thats a problem PERIOD By centering someones worth and importance purely around who they are dating you take away from their actual accomplishments PERIOD I mean lets note all of Swifts accomplishments which consist of  Grammy Awards three being Album of the Year wins a Primetime Emmy Award  American Music Awards  Billboard Music Awards  MTV Music Awards three IFIP Global Recording Artist of the Year awards and  Guinness World Records PERIOD Needless to say she has shattered many records and her success should not be overlooked by her possible new love interest PERIOD How would you like it if someone saw you only as who you were dating It is belittling simple as that PERIOD

How about instead of focusing on who Taylor Swift is dating we focus more on her actual career It is hypocritical to sit there and rat on Swift for dating someone when there are plenty of other male celebrities and musicians who are doing the exact same thing PERIOD I dont see people obsessing over them Take a look at artists such as Bruno Mars The Weekend Post Malone etc PERIOD Each has had their fair share of girlfriends and controversy and yet when you google them or ask others about them they dont say things like hes had too many girlfriends or he needs to stop writing so many breakup songs. what they do instead is praise these musicians successes PERIOD It is interesting how the focus is on the women in the music industry not the men PERIOD How about we quit these double standards PERIOD Taylor Swift has purely been growing her career doing nothing but trying to get people to focus on her music and yet after all her efforts people still are only seeing her as a woman who dates around PERIOD I imagine it to be exhausting putting so much work into your craft only for people to be focused on a superficial aspect of your life PERIOD

So lets obsess over Taylors music instead Stop making the same joke about how shes going to write a song about Kelce because thats what she does its getting old PERIOD The fact is Taylors music is loved and adored by millions and of fans all over the worldshe is the first female artist to reach  million monthly listeners on Spotify and the music doesnt just focus on her exes PERIOD Her albums each take on a different era of her life incorporating new genres and concepts PERIOD Not every song is about a breakup PERIOD Plus even if it was why do people care so much Think about all the men in the music industry who write about their relationships its a topic in music that has been used by countless songwriters PERIOD Again with the double standards PERIOD

If we want to talk about Taylor Swift or any musical artistespecially women lets focus on their career as a musician not who they may or may not be dating PERIOD While its okay to be intrigued there is a limit to how much you should obsess over it PERIOD Take a pause from all the drama circulating around Taylor Swift and just direct your attention to the actual success she has achieved and if you want to critique her make it about something legitimate not some sexist take on her new boyfriend or her music PERIOD That goes for any artist theyre not just there for our entertainment they are human beings PERIOD Now I hope this is the last article you read regarding Swift and Kelce because its time to focus on more important things PERIOD

SO TRUE QUEEN Best article 

this is so true PERIOD this should be mandatory reading for all citizens

OMG THIS IS SO REEEAAAALLLLL Focus on the music people
