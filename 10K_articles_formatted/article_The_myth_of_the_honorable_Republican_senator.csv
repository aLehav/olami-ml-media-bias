5310,2019-09-27,"stop me if youve heard this one PERIOD Our Republican legislators for all their faults are decent fairminded folks committed to the common interest  its the cesspool of Washington politics that is to blame for the dire straits in which we find our country PERIOD Former Sen PERIOD Jeff Flake RArizona argued along such lines at a Stanford in Government event the Thursday before last contending that most conservative congresspeople are good guys in a bad spot PERIOD According to Flake his erstwhile colleagues  traditional though they may be  are essentially moral genuine just PERIOD Many even wish Trump were out of office replaced by someone a little steadier and a little saner and this silent majority would curb the excesses of the current administration if only it were electorally tenable to do so PERIOD To hear Flake tell it these are honest men and women caught in a bind and if necessary they will do whats right PERIOD Maybe so maybe so PERIOD Yet Flake fails to answer the obvious question Where are these honorable Republicans now

Our nation is in the midst of a crisis not seen since World War II PERIOD It has rarely been more important for our representatives in government to put their personal incentives aside and defend the life and liberty of those they are sworn to protect PERIOD Yet what do we see Partisan warfare political waffling statesponsored medical malpractice on a massive scale PERIOD Hardheartedness PERIOD Racism PERIOD And to top it off a president that encourages violence and a governing party that lets him PERIOD Again and again those trustworthy noble Republicans roll over on every issue imaginable PERIOD Susan Collins independentminded feminist voted for Kavanaugh PERIOD Lindsey Graham friend of Joe Biden called for a conspiracybased investigation into Bidens son PERIOD Richard Burr profited off the pandemic PERIOD Rand Paul attacked the director of the National Institutes of Health PERIOD There isnt an ounce of spine or a flicker of empathy among the lot of them and Flake is naive to think that these people are working for anyone but themselves PERIOD

More naive is the idea that the Republican Party can be saved PERIOD Flake believes that a resurgence of leadership is all that stands between his former colleagues and moral redemption PERIOD A wave of individualist thinkers could sweep away the rot at the core of our politics and we could all get back to the business of bettering lives PERIOD A nice thought PERIOD But Flake is mistaken for a reason as simple as it is sad The modern GOP has ceased to be an instrument for a cogent political ideology PERIOD It is not the party of limited government and personal freedom  indeed those principles apply only when the other side is in control PERIOD Nor is it the party of social conservatism The occupant of the White House is proof enough of that PERIOD At present the GOP is merely the party of power of keeping it and wielding it of doing whatever it takes to win PERIOD It stands for nothing PERIOD It means nothing PERIOD Its battles are political and its judgment are amoral and little matters to it except victories and votes PERIOD And that is why Flake is incorrect No amount of leadership or rugged individualism can rekindle a flame of conscience longsince extinguished PERIOD

Nowhere is this abdication of duty more evident than in Republican responses to the extrajudicial killing of George Floyd PERIOD Absent are grief or reproach or empathy PERIOD Their tears are for the dollar not the dead and their every action conveys the disdain they have for the issues at hand PERIOD Its Ted Cruz calling peaceful demonstrations an abuse of power. its Mitch McConnell condoning the teargassing of protestors PERIOD Its the decades of parliamentary inaction indifference and ignorance that brought us to this point and the refusal to engage with police brutality even now PERIOD These arent Senators these are hardly people PERIOD They are unrecognizable as public servants and Flake is wrong to see them as such PERIOD

Still some empathy is warranted PERIOD Flake was one of the few partisans to stand up to Trump and for that he deserves credit PERIOD Perhaps his perspective is understandable  the man is a conservative exiled or not and no one wants to break with their party PERIOD But to maintain the fiction that these are just good guys in a bad spot that Republican complicity is not ruthlessness but weakness is to entirely underestimate a political organization Flake knows all too well PERIOD McConnell said it himself Its the judges stupid PERIOD The GOP is not standing idly by out of fear of an executive tweet or a primary challenge PERIOD They are not afraid of this president PERIOD They are enabling him empowering him using him for their own ends PERIOD Trump is a riot of the American soul and Republican lawmakers are the true looters picking through the rubble of a ruined nation for judicial appointments PERIOD So tell us Jeff Flake Wheres the honor in that
