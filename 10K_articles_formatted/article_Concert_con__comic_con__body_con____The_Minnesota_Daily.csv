by  Gunthar ReisingPublished  September  

On one end of the room a folk quartet sang covers PERIOD The other end rang with the nerdy conversations that occur when people congregate over a mutual passion PERIOD Tables displaying the works of local comic book artists stretched inbetween PERIOD

Welcome to Moving Bodies at the Bedlam  a onetime event intended to garner interest in Chance Wyatts Kickstarterfunded comic book Moving Bodies. i dont know if youre into comics or if youre into music or if youre into booze but I hope you get into all three tonight local comic book writer and the events emcee Lucas Munson said PERIOD

The eclectic event opened with Nomad a folk quartet that performed synchronously as the comic book convention heated up PERIOD



I just happen to know some people in music and comics who are losers like me and want to get their work out Wyatt said PERIOD

The evenings entertainment continued with Kathleen Towell reading her poetry to the overstimulated crowd PERIOD

Towell like most of the artists present was a friend of Wyatt PERIOD They met at a local coffee shop PERIOD

Were just some pretentious nerds getting together and talking about our creations Wyatt said with the most charming selfdeprecation PERIOD

Wyatts project and the events namesake is a science fiction graphic novel PERIOD

Its an attempt to show the kind of interstellar world we might live in in the future Wyatt said PERIOD If we did live inbetween stars what would that look like



Despite no background in science or art Wyatt is determined to combine the two PERIOD

The goal is to have a lot of science that you can look at through a keyhole  its stuff to think about he said PERIOD

Posters of illustrations from Moving Bodies gave the venue a dark aesthetic youd find in a Ridley Scott film PERIOD Although his works name suggests a zombie apocalypse Wyatt said he has no desire to make comic books for popular appeal PERIOD

I feel like Kickstarter is the place for me because my comic books arent about superheroes he said PERIOD

The Kickstarter campaign to get Moving Bodies published has raised just over  PERIOD

I was asking for   so were doing well Wyatt said PERIOD



On stage Munson demanded the audience give the performing artists a bigger round of applause PERIOD He then took a break from his emcee duties to return to the comic book tables where he was also exhibiting some of his work PERIOD

Munson is the author of Siamese a science fiction comic about a man who encounters a woman identical to his late wife PERIOD

I had this dream that I thought would make the most incredible story PERIOD I thought What the hell I want to try to write one of these things Munson said PERIOD

From  p.m PERIOD until  a.m. enthusiastic comic book artists merged with musicians over art and alcohol  just as Munson had
hoped PERIOD
