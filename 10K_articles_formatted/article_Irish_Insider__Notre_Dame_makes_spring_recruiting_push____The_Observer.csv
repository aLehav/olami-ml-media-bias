Charlotte Edmonds  Friday April  

Falling short of its College Football Playoff aspirations last season hasnt seemed to stop Notre Dame on the recruiting trail PERIOD After sealing the 11thranked  recruiting class on National Signing Day per Rivals the coaching staff has used that momentum to shift its focus towards the class of  PERIOD The  commitments the Irish received from the incoming class the most during head coach Brian Kellys tenure helped earn them their sixthstraight top15 class PERIOD

With only three commitments from the class of  compared to the  they had at this point last year the coaching staff can expect the upcomingclass to be significantly smaller PERIOD Blue and Gold Illustrated recruiting analyst Bryan Driskell said this isnt a cause for concern as this years class is an outlier PERIOD

The three biggest months for Notre Dame are March April and the biggest month being July Driskell said PERIOD In July youre getting commitments from kids that visited in May and June. driskell said the July surge Notre Dame has typically experienced under Kelly can be attributed to the distance many recruits have to travel to campus putting it at a disadvantage early in the recruiting race PERIOD

At Georgia half your class is gonna be from your state PERIOD That just doesnt happen here he said PERIOD

As the coaching staff prepares to head out on the road to visit recruits Driskell said these next few weeks will be important to watch how they do as far as picking up commitments PERIOD

If it gets to May  and they havent added four or five more guys Im probably starting to get a little concerned he said PERIOD But I think right now theyre right on target for where they need to be. in the second weekend of this evaluation period the Irish are set to host nine athletes  five from the class of  three from the class of  and a top prostyle quarterback recruit from within Indiana for the class of   for the annual BlueGold game PERIOD

In addition to the uncommitted players expected this weekend five signees from the class of  will also be attendance including top quarterbackcommit Phil Jurkovec PERIOD Jurkovec a fourstar dualthreat quarterback was the first Irish commit during the summer after his sophomore year PERIOD Driskell said this allowed him to become a ringleader for that class and attract other elite recruits PERIOD

Top players want to play with other top players he said PERIOD

The Irish seem to be sticking to that strategy of recruiting an elite quarterback heavily in hopes of drawing in other top talent after the recent commitment of Drew Pyne PERIOD The No PERIOD  prostyle quarterback and native of New Canaan Connecticut committed to Notre Dame last Monday and was the first Irish commit for the class of  PERIOD He chose Notre Dame over Michigan Oklahoma Alabama and other top programs PERIOD

In this day of college football if you want to win you have to have a great quarterback PERIOD And kids know that so when a bigtime quarterback commits to a school early you kind of now know who your quarterbacks going to be Driskell said PERIOD Pynes a top40 caliber player who was offered a scholarship before his sophomore year PERIOD The Irish havent offered a single quarterback since. beyond kicking off their recruiting classes with top quarterbacks the Irish have also taken a new approach in their visits  hosting small weekends that often combine uncommitted and committed players such as this weekend.Driskell said this is only possible due to the small size Notre Dame is focusing on for its upcoming recruiting class PERIOD

In the first weekend of official visits the Irish hosted five recruits from the class of   two of which were committed  this past weekend PERIOD This included one of the biggest targets for the class NaNa OsafoMensah PERIOD

Hes a talented player  and is a very very key recruit to this team Driskell said PERIOD

Meanwhile as the Irish continue to build their future classes theyve continued to be plagued in the running back search PERIOD With the early departure of Josh Adams and the imminent graduation of senior Dexter Williams the Irish will be left with a shortage on the depth charge PERIOD Despite the return of junior Tony Jones Jr PERIOD and the addition of incoming freshmen Jahmir Smith and CBo Flemister there is still a degree of uncertainty around the position going forward PERIOD The coaching staff has made some adjustments in the offseason giving sophomores Jafar Armstrong and Avery Davis some snaps in the backfield PERIOD However it continues to be an area of focus on the recruiting trail PERIOD

Theyre having to move some guys around which is not ideal PERIOD  Its a concern Driskell said of the running back position PERIOD Its the one area on the offense where recruiting has really lagged behind these past three years. driskell said there are still some talented players on the board none of which have indicated Notre Dame as a front runner PERIOD

They havent really thrown out a lot of offers yet but you can expect to see that expand in the near future Driskell said PERIOD
