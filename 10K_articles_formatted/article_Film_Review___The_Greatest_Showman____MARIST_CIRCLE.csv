Spoilers maybe PERIOD

I recently saw the movie The Greatest Showman expecting to hate it PERIOD While the music was pretty good variations on You Will Be Found eight times and some of the choreography was a blast the movie as a whole was so bad PERIOD There was no plot or character development at all the main conflict of the movie didnt happen until an hour and ten minutes in and was resolved in probably a record breaking sixty seconds PERIOD

But thats not my biggest issue with the movie I have two big problems PERIOD The first is on the surface and the second is what is not addressed in the film PERIOD

First The Greatest Showman is just a story about a male white ablebodied savior for people with physical oddities like dwarfism albinism or hypertrichosis PERIOD P.T PERIOD Barnum is shown as some kind of enlightened entrepreneur who sees value in people where others see freaks PERIOD He then proceeds to save them by offering them a place in his show PERIOD In short he exploits them PERIOD He takes people that society makes fun of and puts them all in one place so society can pay to make fun of them PERIOD

This isnt a story of disabled and ridiculed people selfadvocating PERIOD None of the circus performers are fullyfleshed out characters or even partiallyfleshed out for that matter PERIOD They simply exist in the movie as assets for Barnum to make money off PERIOD Sidebar is that a character flaw I have no idea PERIOD The movie didnt do any character development for anyone PERIOD Even at the end after Barnum literally abandons these real people that he had been exploiting to go make money doing something else they return and say something like Everyone always gave up on us you cant give up on us too. these characters were saying that they needed this ablebodied savior or else they would have to go back to their sad lives without him PERIOD What kind of message is that giving What on earth Its 

Now you could say Well Jon it was the early 1850s and 60s it was a different time Thats how society was Its historically accurate

Oh you want to talk about historical accuracy

Theres a scene where Barnum is holding public auditions for these creatures to come and see if theyre good enough to join the circus the message being that these people voluntarily eagerly and excitedly wanted to be saved by Hugh Jackman PERIOD While Barnum mightve at some point held auditions I can promise you thats not how he got his start PERIOD He had been showing off Annie Jones Elliot Bearded Lady since she was nine months old PERIOD He had been showing off Charles Stratton General Tom Thumb since he was four years old PERIOD When Stratton was  his father died and Barnum adopted him PERIOD There was no way Stratton or Elliot or anyone else in the circus for that matter was making nearly enough money to be selfreliant PERIOD Barnum was an exploitative circus master who took advantage of disabled people for personal profit PERIOD

But Jon that sounds like slavery

Okay Lets talk about slavery PERIOD

This is my biggest issue with the movie because its what doesnt happen PERIOD The movie completely glosses over and in fact completely rewrites how Barnum got his start PERIOD Barnum lived in New York where slavery was abolished in  PERIOD In  though Barnum was able to use a loophole to rent a slave named Joice Heth PERIOD I just want to make it clear that almost a decade after slavery was made illegal Barnum owned a slave PERIOD Its also important to point out that Heth was severely paralyzed and completely blind PERIOD

Barnum toured Heth around the country for years as the most astonishing and interesting curiosity in the world Heth was advertised as being  years old and as being the former slave of George Washington and his mother PERIOD Barnum would tell people that Heth had been the first person to put clothes on Washington as an infant and claimed that she had raised the future president PERIOD

Obviously none of that was true PERIOD What is true is that Barnum found a paralyzed blind elderly former slave woman who couldnt advocate for herself reenslaved her and turned her into a spectacle for him to make money off of PERIOD Even after Heth died he charged admission for a public autopsy so the public could see that she wasnt actually over  years old and could not have been Washingtons nanny PERIOD

Barnum owned a slave years after slavery was illegal lied to people about what he was showing off and then charged admission so people could watch her corpse be cut up after she died PERIOD Only then was Barnum ready to move on to his next project PERIOD What kind of monster does that

Now Barnum was clearly exploitive racist and awful PERIOD But was the movie The Greatest Showman as bad as this guy was Yes obviously PERIOD

The reason its a terrible movie is because it doesnt at all speak about the appalling things Barnum did in his life PERIOD The movie picks the fancy parts they want to glorify and then rewrites history over the parts they dont PERIOD This is extremely dangerous PERIOD The circus is about as American as high school marching bands PERIOD Everyone knows they exist but people sort of take it for granted PERIOD Every school has a marching band but not everyone interacts with it all the time PERIOD Most people dont really care about the history of a marching band or take the time to seek out the history PERIOD Marching bands certainly arent the brightest or strongest thread in the fabric of American culture but theyre there regardless and it would be weird if they werent PERIOD The circus is the same way PERIOD People just take for granted that its a part of American culture but no one really cares enough to look into the history of the circus or of Barnum PERIOD

With The Greatest Showman massive amounts of people are going to be exposed to a history that simply isnt true PERIOD This is a history of a founder of a piece of American culture an idealist who saw past the ignorance of others a ragstoriches story a testament to the combination of American workethic ingenuity capitalism and the full embodiment of the American dream I guess PERIOD But its not a true history because it completely erases the raciallydriven reality of the founding of the circus PERIOD And when one erases the racially driven history of some aspect of American culture it acts to diminish the terrible and massive role slavery had in the history of America PERIOD

The Barnum that The Greatest Showman has dancing around is not at all the same Barnum that existed in real life PERIOD And when the ignorant masses are exposed to the lies the movie tells they will accept it as true history because they have no one telling them otherwise PERIOD The Greatest Showman tells dangerous racist lies as truth and many people are going to believe it PERIOD
