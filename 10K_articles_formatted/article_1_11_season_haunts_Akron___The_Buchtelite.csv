Is it possible to find a glimmer of hope in a  season

The Akron football program heads into the offseason pondering that question for the third consecutive year PERIOD

This time around they were led by a new coaching staff a new quarterback and a new style of play PERIOD

The results were simply old news PERIOD

With a  loss to Toledo last Tuesday the Zips received their ninth
straight loss PERIOD

They maintained their stranglehold on the bottom of the MidAmerican Conference and are one of six teams in the country to have one or fewer wins PERIOD
Firstyear head coach Terry Bowden had stated during preseason that any number between two and  in the win column would be considered a success which would now seemingly be a goal that transfers over to the  season PERIOD

As bad as a  record over the course of three seasons sounds the phrase It can only go up from here is as relevant as ever PERIOD

Bowden will head into his first full offseason of recruiting with the ability to sell a topnotch stadium and the chance to play as a freshman PERIOD

His name alone carries weight PERIOD

The Zips will bring back freshman quarterback Kyle Pohl who shined in his first start in the final game of  PERIOD

Sophomore running back Jawon Chisholm will return to the backfield after amassing over  yards on the ground the past two seasons PERIOD

Four of the Zips top five receivers will be back in uniform when spring practice begins PERIOD

In all seven starters are projected to return on both sides of the ball PERIOD

Another year in Bowdens system may be all they need PERIOD

While  has become all too familiar to Akron fans next season may just bring the change they are looking for wins PERIOD
