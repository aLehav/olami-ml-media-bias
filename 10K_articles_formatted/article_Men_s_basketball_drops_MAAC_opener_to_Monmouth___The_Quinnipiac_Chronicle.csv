The Quinnipiac mens basketball team began its regular season conference play as it hosted Monmouth on Thursday night PERIOD Despite an impressive showing from the teams freshmen the Bobcats ultimately fell to the Hawks  PERIOD

Monmouth was the preseason favorite to win the MAAC while Quinnipiac was voted second to last in the conference coaches poll PERIOD The Bobcats needed to play a physical and wellrounded game in order to come out victorious as the underdogs PERIOD As a result of two  scoring runs by Monmouth the Bobcats trailed by roughly  points nearly the entire second half and failed to overpower the Hawks PERIOD

An impressive performance by Monmouth head coach Tom Moore said PERIOD They shot the ball well competed with a real high IQ and played to the preseason expectations that were on them. as for his team Moore simply said We still have a lot to figure out. mediacredit id2148 alignalignright width300mediacredit

The opening minutes of the MAAC opener consisted of one sloppy play after another as both teams could not find a way to score PERIOD Quinnipiac junior guard Reggie Oliver started the game and looked to have the hot hand after knocking down an early 3pointer PERIOD However he would soon leave and did not return to action for the rest of the game PERIOD His absence forced Moore to provide more minutes to his freshman guards Mikey Dixon who finished with a teamhigh  points and Peter Kiss PERIOD

Both freshmen shined in the teams three games at the AdvoCare Invitational last week and had high expectations by fans coming into Thursday nights matchup PERIOD Junior forward Chaise Daniels also had an impressive showing in Orlando Florida most notably a 14point doubledouble in a loss to Seton Hall PERIOD In the first half against Monmouth Daniels had arguably his most dominant half this season with nine points and eight rebounds in  minutes PERIOD

While some players shined others failed to provide on the statsheet PERIOD Senior guard Daniel Harris who has taken on the role as a team leader both on and off the court had only two points in the first half and failed to hit a single shot or dish an assist over the first  minutes PERIOD Coach Moore quickly noted the struggle from one of his most dominant players PERIOD

Danny Harris will get there Moore said PERIOD He missed some open shots tonight and was really beating himself up for that PERIOD I dont think he gives himself enough credit for how effective he can be at putting it on the deck and going by guys. the Bobcats trailed  at the half and could not find an answer to the Hawks offense which shot  from beyond the threepoint line while Quinnipiac went  PERIOD The second half was no different as Monmouths Collin Stewart went  from three and finished the game with  points PERIOD

With Thursday nights loss the Bobcats fall to a  overall record this season PERIOD The team will have another chance to get their second win as they host Marist on Sunday at  p.m PERIOD
