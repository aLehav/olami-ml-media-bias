Junior international studies major Shane Seniour was named GD Ritzys player of the game on the Rodney Watson on Basketball radio show after the teams game against Cedarville PERIOD Shane played two years at Parkland College in Illinois before transferring back to his hometown to attend USI PERIOD The Shield sat down to talk to him about his transition and his experience so far PERIOD

The Shield Can you talk a little bit about your reasoning for transferring to USI

Seniour Well after my two years at Parkland I had a lot of different schools contacting me wanting me to come and visit and stuff PERIOD I was actually committed to Chicago State University which is D1 about six or seven hours away from home PERIOD But Im real close with my family PERIOD Last year at the beginning of the year I had some complications in my family PERIOD I had a family member who had some health issues PERIOD So every weekend I was making trips over to Indianapolis and when you go through something like that you realize whats important PERIOD When I talked to Coach Watson and realized I had the opportunity to come back home and play in front of friends and family it wasnt something I wanted to pass up PERIOD

The Shield You had nine doubledoubles in your last season at Parkland PERIOD Then in the game against Cedarville you earned your first doubledouble for USI PERIOD Is that something you see continuing

Seniour Yeah thats definitely something PERIOD Id like to get more than nine and break my record from last year PERIOD But when Coach recruited me I think that was something he really liked PERIOD He saw me as a guy who could come in and get a doubledouble PERIOD

The Shield You scored  points but you really added to the game with your  rebounds PERIOD Is rebounding something you take a lot of pride in or a focus of your game

Seniour Yeah if I had to say one skill or asset I bring to the team its definitely rebounding PERIOD

The Shield Are you enjoying USI Has it been an easy transition for you

Seniour Yeah Ive got a lot of friends here that I was able to reconnect with PERIOD Being away for two years I hadnt talked to a lot of people PERIOD So its been nice catching back up with people PERIOD Obviously being  minutes away from home because my family lives in Newburgh so thats nice PERIOD I get to go home for a home cooked meal once or twice a week PERIOD

The Shield Is there something that you think USI could offer you in basketball or in your major

Seniour Well Im majoring in international studies so thats kinda specific PERIOD A lot of people are surprised I guess because Im an athlete or a basketball player that Im majoring in that PERIOD But the program at USI is definitely up and coming this year and in the past few years its really grown into something PERIOD So shout out to the international studies program PERIOD Im sure Dr PERIOD Rivera would be happy to get a shout out in The Shield PERIOD

The Shield Are there any goals that you have for yourself during your time on the USI team

Seniour Yeah win a national championship PERIOD Win a GLVC championship like they did last year and then go on and bring a national championship home PERIOD That was another reason I decided to come to USI over a low major D1 because in a low major D1 youre playing just to get in the tournament PERIOD Whereas talking to Coach and him telling me the kind of guys he had I realized I could home and play for a national championship PERIOD So that was definitely another big reason for coming here PERIOD
