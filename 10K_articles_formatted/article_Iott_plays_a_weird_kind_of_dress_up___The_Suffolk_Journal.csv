In order to be voted into Congress these days there are certain qualities an individual must have a trustworthy face and a whole heap of money PERIOD But now that Rich Iott is in the picture as a Congressional candidate for Ohios ninth Congressional District the ballpark has opened up a little PERIOD



Originally from Ohio Iott was President and CEO of the Seaway Food Town grocery chain until  and has been an executive film producer since  PERIOD Additionally he has served in the Ohio Military Reserve since  PERIOD And if these things are not interesting enough Iott also likes to dress up as a Nazi and reenact World War II to learn and teach history PERIOD

In his defense the Nazi reenactment groups website Wiking.org does claim that the group does not hold the Nazi views and are not racist in anyway PERIOD It claims that the group is solely for educational purposes PERIOD

Iott has stated that he only does the reenactments to spend time with his son PERIOD Because taking your kid to an Ohio State game is overrated these days anyway right He also has set up an alter ego in his own mind named Reinhard Pferdmann PERIOD Pferdmann in Iotts mind is a courageous soldier who fought for the Axis powers during the war PERIOD The whole alter ego business caught me by surprise and it seems like there might be a few screws loose in that head PERIOD Id be the last person to call someone crazy however so Ill let the media take care that PERIOD

When I first heard about this guy I gave him the benefit of the doubt PERIOD After all I didnt want to automatically mark him up as a jackass based on one instance PERIOD I looked all around to try to and find something positive about him but the more and more I looked I kept finding interviews and more information that made Iott look like a blubbering fool who never gives a straightforward answer PERIOD

When asked by Fox News Laura Emerson to explain why he listed his occupation as a soldier for the state of Ohio Iott denied remembering anything about it PERIOD He asked for verification of the document and unfortunately for him he was handed it within  minutes PERIOD When he realized there was no way out of the situation he spewed out some garbage and began talking in circles Uh no actually I cant PERIOD I am a soldier of the State of Ohio  Im in the Ohio Military Reserve  And I dont know  I dont know how that was  got that way to be honest with you. my point is that if someone wants to wear a Nazi uniform it doesnt affect my life PERIOD It is their choice and as long as they dont harm anyone while they are doing it they have the freedom to PERIOD Thats what is so great about this country after all PERIOD  But for that man to try to become a leader of the country is absolutely absurd PERIOD The citizens of America are growing tired PERIOD We are tired of recession tired of outrageous prices and tired of being told what is going to happen by some rich bastard who wont lose a wink of sleep if I starve to death tonight PERIOD I cant speak for everyone but I know that I really just need a little bit of hope that just maybe there is an honest man or woman out there who does care PERIOD And I can tell you that if Iott does get elected that would ruin the little bit of hope I have left PERIOD

If a person wants to run around in a Nazi uniform and shoot fake assault rifles then so be it PERIOD People get so worked up these days about how other people want to live their lives PERIOD If no one is being harmed in any way then no one should stress about it PERIOD

This life is way too short and complicated enough without constantly freaking out about how other people live PERIOD But leading a country is a different situation PERIOD Given enough power who knows what Iott or better yet Pferdmann could do I think David Kushma of the Toledo Blade said it best Give Iott the benefit of the doubt not votes. your School PERIOD Your Paper PERIOD Since  PERIOD
