Each year as you walk through malls or enter your local shopping center there is usually someone asking for a charitable donation for some organization PERIOD

Often people will throw in a few dollars or the extra change that is sitting at the bottom of their purse into the bucket PERIOD What many fail to realize is the importance of their donation and the impact it can have on other people PERIOD

Most of the time they also do not take the time to learn about the organization they are giving to and what the charitable commitment of that organization is PERIOD

In the United States there are some respectable charities whose charitable commitment percentage is over  PERIOD Direct Relief provides emergency medical assistance and disaster relief to those living in the United States and internationally and their charitable commitment is  according to Forbes PERIOD

But while donating to national and international organizations is beneficial and can create change there are local charities right here in Framingham and even on our campus that need your help too PERIOD

Here at FSU we have the Rams Resource Center RRC which provides nonperishable food toiletries menstrual products and resource referral to FSU students faculty and staff PERIOD

The RRC is always welcoming donations and their most needed items include cereal granola bars oatmeal shelfstable milk microwavable items menstrual products especially pads and razors PERIOD

Donation bins can be found across campus in locations such as The Dean of Students OTce McCarthy  Office of Enrollment and Student Development Dwight Hall  and other locations that are identified on the FSU website PERIOD

Donating to oncampus resources such as the RRC is critical because it can help students who may have nowhere else to turn but FSU PERIOD

A donation of a box of granola bars or a bag of trail mix is never just a small donation because it can mean a student has access to an afternoon snack PERIOD

Most students may not be able to afford to donate items to the RRC but they can volunteer their time to help keep the shelves stocked and ready to go for the next person who walks through the door PERIOD

For more information on how to donate how to volunteer or how to access the RRC email the Dean of Students office PERIOD

The RRC is located underneath West Hall and the hours of operation can be found on FSUs website PERIOD

Students are also able to donate meal swipes to the Universitys Emergency Meal Bank to help others facing food insecurity on our campus PERIOD

Students may donate up to one meal a week PERIOD This is a great way to give back directly to other FSU students especially if you have an extra meal swipe you know you wont need PERIOD

To donate go to the FSU Dining Services website and look for Donate a Meal under the shop tab PERIOD

Currently enrolled FSU students are allowed to request up to Lve emergency meals a semester by completing the form on the FSU website PERIOD Students who may need more can contact the Dean of Students Office to discuss campus resources that may be helpful PERIOD

Academics makes being a student already stressful enough PERIOD No student should ever have to worry when their next meal will be or how they will afford it PERIOD

FSU also participates in charitable donations throughout the year PERIOD Just recently FSU Campus Police and SILD partnered for the seventh annual Giving Tree event which is a program that provides holiday gifts to children in need PERIOD With the donations they were able to provide gifts to over  children according to the United Way of TriCountrys Instagram PERIOD

Giving back to the FSU community should not be difficult  and it isnt PERIOD

By giving back to our community and to other students you are not only making an impact on

someones day  but potentially their life PERIOD
