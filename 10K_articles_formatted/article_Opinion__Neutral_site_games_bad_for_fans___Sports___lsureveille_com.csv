LSU Tiger Stadium on Thursday August   PERIOD

Itll occur when you pack your bags Friday ready for a weekend trip to Houston PERIOD After getting gas for your five hour drive youll pass Tiger Stadium recently refurbished and expanded PERIOD

Then you might ask yourself If we have a great stadium why are we driving to Texas to play in another one

It is now known that LSU is the reason the Tigers are playing at neutral sites for their twoyear rivalry with Wisconsin PERIOD At Big Ten Media Day this season Wisconsin coach Gary Andersen said he would have said yes to a homeandhome series against LSU PERIOD

The statement sparked hate from many LSU fans questioning the point of having such a sparkling stadium if LSU was only going to host the Sam Houston States of the world PERIOD The stadium looks bigger and more imposing than ever it would only make sense to show it off PERIOD

Junior cornerback Jalen Collins said he would prefer playing a homeandhome series rather than neutral sites PERIOD

I would definitely take playing in Tiger Stadium and then playing them at their place Collins said PERIOD I would definitely sacrifice playing at Wisconsin one season PERIOD Getting that homefield advantage because here we have the best atmosphere in college football. the last time I remember LSU hosting a big non conference team it went pretty well PERIOD In September  LSU destroyed eventual Atlantic Coast Conference champions Virginia Tech  PERIOD The game couldnt have been more onesided and it helped propel the Tigers to their third national championship PERIOD

The reason LSU has shied away from these games and gone for neutral site games is simple LSU is going national PERIOD

Thats what happens when you play in Dallas Atlanta and Houston enough times to start the season PERIOD With each of these games comes a guaranteed primetime television spot and with that comes national recognition and a good deal of revenue PERIOD

The neutral sites also help LSU expand its reach in both recruiting and as a fan base PERIOD Kids can be easily influenced and seeing the Tigers play in their hometown can make them either want to play for LSU or become a fan PERIOD

The largest factor is how big the alumni base is in cities like Houston and Dallas PERIOD LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva knows the stadiums there can be filled and he knows LSU fans will travel anywhere else PERIOD

LSU fans however know nothing is going to compare to playing at Tiger Stadium no matter how many seats are filled PERIOD

There hasnt been reason to change so far with the Tigers going  in their last three neutral site nonconference games PERIOD But all it takes is one loss and the murmurs of having to play in Houston will quickly turn to yelling PERIOD

Oregon learned its lesson in  when they lost to LSU  in Dallas to begin the season PERIOD Starting this season the Ducks will begin a homeandhome series against Michigan State PERIOD It might be a coincidence but it should still be noted PERIOD

Im not saying LSU is going to lose to Wisconsin and Im not even saying neutral sites are a bad thing PERIOD What Im saying is that LSU is at a crossroads it can be a program that serves its fans or a program that serves its brand PERIOD
