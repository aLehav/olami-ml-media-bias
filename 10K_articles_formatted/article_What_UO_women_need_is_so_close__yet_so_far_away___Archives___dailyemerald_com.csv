7667,1970-01-01,"imagine how it feels when youre running a high fever  that hotthencold feeling when the world spins your head aches and your muscles feel empty PERIOD

Now imagine that youre holding an antidote PERIOD Take one swig the bottle reads and that sickly feeling will melt away. theres just one problem PERIOD You cant pop the lid off the darn bottle PERIOD

After four straight losses its obvious that the Oregon womens basketball team isnt in good health right now mentally or physically PERIOD

Three of the Ducks five seniors sustained injuries PERIOD Heads must be aching as inexperienced players are not dealing well with more playing time PERIOD From whats transpired on the court this season disorientation could be another symptom of Oregons illness PERIOD

No doubt the Ducks stomachs must still be doing somersaults PERIOD That rollercoaster drop from first to sixth in the Pacific10 Conference would make my insides churn PERIOD

But even if its no longer ranked in the top25 polls you keep watching this Oregon team PERIOD Perhaps youre feeling sick too because you see the seams fraying and you can almost feel the pain the Ducks endure with each loss PERIOD

And youre frustrated very frustrated because you know that a possible antidote is ohsoclose PERIOD

Shes sitting right there during home games on the left side of the bench decked out in trendy street clothes PERIOD And when the Ducks are looking for that late push to topple Southern California in the fourth quarter you are waiting for her to jump out of her seat whirl around a few times and suddenly be donning a gleamingwhite Oregon uniform  complete with black hightops wristbands and a headband of course  and you want her to save the day PERIOD

Theres just one problem PERIOD She cant PERIOD

I wouldnt risk a year of eligibility for that junior point guard Shaquala Williams said brushing aside the possibility of a lateseason return PERIOD I think my future right now is more important than trying to save the season. williams says she is about  percent healthy from a torn anterior cruciate ligament that she suffered in September PERIOD She claims she can run and cut as fast as she ever could but that she cant jump as high PERIOD She plans on testing her knee in contact drills definitely next month. which means that if she really wanted to and if her coaches let her Williams could be ready to play by NCAA Tournament time PERIOD

If she could play right now Shaqs presence would be felt in every aspect of Oregons game PERIOD With the extra guard in the lineup forwards Lindsey Dion and Brianne Meharry could return to their natural positions PERIOD The post would get deeper PERIOD Her dribble penetration and offensive creativity would open up scoring options everywhere PERIOD

And Shaquala Williams has confidence PERIOD No current Pac10 guard can touch her and she knows it PERIOD

If Shaq came in pill form shed be just what the doctor ordered for the slumping Oregon women PERIOD

Unfortunately there will be no lateseason comeback PERIOD Williams said she doesnt want to play at less than full throttle and her coaches want her healthy and ready for next season PERIOD

So you continue to follow your beloved Ducks and you cant help but sigh because you know that this should never have happened PERIOD Any of it PERIOD And you wonder if your Ducks will even make the Big Dance this season and that sickly feeling begins to burn again in your chest PERIOD

But then the antidote speaks

They have seven games left and they have to get their confidence back up Williams said PERIOD All they need is maybe one or two good games and theyll be able to get their confidence back up. maybe the real cure has yet to be found PERIOD
