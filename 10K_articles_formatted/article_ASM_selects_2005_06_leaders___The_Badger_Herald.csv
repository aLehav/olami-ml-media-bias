2797,2005-05-03,"it took more than four hours of heated debate and arguments but the Associated Students of Madison eventually elected Eric Varney as the  chair Monday night PERIOD Less than  minutes later ASM members elected Dylan Rath as vice chair PERIOD

ASM began its election with the nominations of Varney and Eyal Halamish for the chair position but after two elections failed to produce a majority vote ASM members nominated a third candidate Jennifer Knox PERIOD

The nomination of Knox precipitated the resignation of Halamish whose eligibility was frequently brought into question by Varney supporters because last year Halamish was appointed as a Governance Committee Chair and was not actually elected to an ASM position PERIOD

My main goal next year is to revamp the ASM image Varney said while debating Halamish PERIOD Varney added he also considers rising textbook prices a serious issue PERIOD

Varney also promised to help lower tuition by keeping segregated fees down because thats what ASM can control. regarding his political leanings Varney said he airs a little bit on the conservative side but emphasized he has no personal agenda PERIOD

Following the nomination of Jennifer Knox many of Varneys supporters questioned the dedication of Knox considering her lastminute entry but Varney insisted Knoxs nomination did not bother him PERIOD

I think its totally okay to do Varney said PERIOD This is all part of the democratic process. two more inconclusive elections between Varney and Knox were conducted before Varney finally prevailed with  votes in his favor and  for Knox PERIOD

Several ASM members were outspoken in their criticism of Knoxs late entry PERIOD

ASM Finance Committee Chair Barbara Kiernoziak loudly criticized a fellow members proposal to reopen the nomination process as totally inappropriate as she believed the election of a last minute nominee would not have credibility PERIOD

Kiernoziak also was outspoken concerning Halamishs eligibility as she predicted a lawsuit would be filed against ASM if Halamish was elected chair PERIOD

I think that theres going to be a lawsuit Kiernoziak said PERIOD Anytime that he has to vote on any budgets there could be legal consequences. halamish himself acknowledged the controversial nature of his position and said after speaking with Student Judiciary Chief Justice Nathanial Romano he expected a lawsuit would come if he were elected but that his side would win in the court of law PERIOD

Varney took his position as chair immediately after being elected and assumed responsibilities for the remainder of the night PERIOD He committed his first error shortly thereafter when he did not follow correct procedural matters in the election of John Brunning as secretary PERIOD

Varney preemptively revealed the tally of the roll call vote and then asked if any members wanted to change their votes at which time ASM member Brandon Sivret changed his vote resulting in a tie PERIOD Varney quickly acknowledged his mistake and conducted a second vote resulting in the uncontested election of Brunning for ASM secretary PERIOD

ASM members also voted on chairs for the  committees PERIOD Results were not available at press time PERIOD
