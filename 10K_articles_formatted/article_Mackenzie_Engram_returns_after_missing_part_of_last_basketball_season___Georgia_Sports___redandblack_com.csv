Georgia forward Mackenzie Engram  dribbles past Tennessee Tech forward Treyvonna Brooks  at Stegeman Coliseum in Athens Ga. on Monday Dec PERIOD   PERIOD  Randy Schafer randy.drum.schafergmail.com

The Georgia womens basketball team had its first practice of the season on Tuesday PERIOD After losing four starters the teams philosophy remains the same PERIOD

We want to run head coach Joni Taylor said PERIOD Thats who we are PERIOD We want to push the basketball PERIOD We enjoy playing that way and we think it gives us a really good chance to win. while four starters are missing theres one welcomed face that will be back on the court to help the team carry out its motto Run as one. she hasnt played in a Georgia uniform since Jan PERIOD   but shes ready to go this season PERIOD Junior forward Mackenzie Engram missed the second half of last season after suffering from pericarditis PERIOD

A common symptom of pericarditis is chest pain which is exactly what Engram was experiencing PERIOD According to the American Heart Association the pain comes from fluid filling the sac around the heart causing chest pain similar to that of a heart attack PERIOD

Anything that involved getting my heart rate up was just too painful to do Engram said PERIOD They just wanted me to sit out and rest PERIOD That was the only thing that would heal it. after sitting out healing and slowly getting back into things this summer she is back with the team and ready to focus on the upcoming season as one of the teams leaders PERIOD

Shes obviously going to help us from an experience standpoint Taylor said PERIOD But I think shes more excited about being out there than all of us which will then carry over to the rest of us. in the  games Engram played last season she scored in double figures seven times had eight blocks and averaged . points and . rebounds per game PERIOD

Sitting out for the last  games of the season may have been the best thing for Engram though PERIOD It was a time for her to gain a new vantage point on the game of basketball  a vantage point she hadnt had in quite some time PERIOD She had hit a midseason midcareer slump which in turn created in her an attitude she didnt like PERIOD

Being able to be on the bench and observe other people also have bad attitudes allowed me to see that its not a good look Engram said PERIOD

After having that experience she is more focused on trying to be positive and take coaching in a more constructive way PERIOD She is watching her attitude on the court being sure to not get upset when something doesnt go her way PERIOD

Even more she thinks her basketball IQ is greater after being able to watch the game from the bench PERIOD She believes it was a blessing in disguise that has allowed her to become a better allaround basketball player PERIOD

The rest of the team is happy she is back PERIOD It felt the pain along with Engram when she was sidelined PERIOD

Its a big deal redshirt senior Pachis Roberts said PERIOD With her coming back with the experience that she has will really help us out. while Engram will be taking it easy for the first little while after a minor setback about a week ago where she experienced slight pain again Taylor says she is going to be fine this season and will be ready to go by the first game against South Carolina State on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

I think God is on my side in it Engram said PERIOD So Im just putting everything in his hands and hopefully it turns out for the best. on Oct PERIOD  the Georgia Bulldogs faced off against Tennessee Volunteers for football and as many game days are it was a celebration of all things Southern with tailgating all around campus PERIOD
