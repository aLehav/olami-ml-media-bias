On a campus that demands high SAT scores as a standard for admission it is disappointing to note that Georgetown students dont utilize their divine gift of articulate speech PERIOD Put simply Georgetown students challenge themselves at just about everything  except public speaking and debate PERIOD
Of course the previous statement was a blanket generalization that would never hold up to any amount of scrutiny but it is beyond dispute that surprisingly little debate takes place on campus PERIOD There are several students however  organized conveniently into groups  who are passionate intellectually driven and articulate about the causes that they believe in PERIOD And yet they fail to debate their ideas with fellow students who hold opposing views PERIOD
Whats the point of free dissent when people do not exercise that right through debate and dialogue What good is liberty if citizens wont freely express themselves in order to avoid confrontation The overuse of the phrase I feel like . to precede an opinion is precisely the kind of spineless nonconfrontational attitude that renders democracy and freedom of expression pointless PERIOD
It would be sad enough if this were a phenomenon restricted to the Hilltop but the malaise regarding substantive debate seems to plague the entire nation PERIOD How many U.S PERIOD congressmen for example could survive an hour of Prime Ministers Questions in the British House of Commons Regrettably I am sure the percentage would be dismally low PERIOD Those congressmen are after all alumni of Americas finest educational institutions  places like Georgetown PERIOD Why then are so few trained in debate that requires more than delivering long speeches prepared in advance
It has long been a joke among the British that Americans do not actually speak the English language but a corruption of it called American. but it seems to me that the loss of eloquence in the language is only a recent phenomenon PERIOD Hearken back to the days when men like Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD and Edward R PERIOD urrow used their words to persuade people to see a side of the debate they had not had the courage to see PERIOD Go back even further to the writings of Thomas Jefferson and one finds some of the finest words ever written in the English language it was still called English back then PERIOD

Even on the Hilltop things were not always this bad PERIOD There was once a time when student groups used to debate each other on a recognized forum that met weekly PERIOD The tradition continues as the Philodemic Society of which I am a member meets every Thursday night at  p.m PERIOD in Healy  PERIOD One of the oldest collegiate debating societies in the United States it once provided a place for students with opposing views to come together regularly and debate issues that mattered most to them PERIOD For instance if Hyas for Choice wanted to debate GU Right to Life they could approach the society to request a debate PERIOD The College Republicans could do the same with the College Democrats Students for Justice in Palestine with the GeorgetownIsrael Alliance and so on PERIOD
What distinguishes the societys debates is their format The debate is over a defined resolution and kicked off by two at times four keynoters who set out the agenda and lay out the arguments PERIOD The debate then continues for the next two hours with people from the floor speaking in turn on either side of the argument PERIOD While seniority in the society dictates who gets to speak the leaders try to make sure that as many nonmembers as possible get to speak PERIOD
The society has over the years produced several distinguished alumni including Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia C  PERIOD It has also produced some amazing debates over the years such as the one this semester about the existence of God PERIOD But perhaps its proudest moment every year is the annual Merrick Debate whose winner receives a gold medal  the only student award that may be worn at the graduation ceremony PERIOD
The Philodemic Society serves as a great example of debate and rhetoric and one of the last organizations that truly celebrates all that the English language can do PERIOD Georgetown students should be more aware and participate more in these events PERIOD
Farooq Tirmizi is a senior in the School of Foreign Service PERIOD He can be reached at tirmizithehoya.com PERIOD FRESH OFF THE BOAT appears every other Friday PERIOD
