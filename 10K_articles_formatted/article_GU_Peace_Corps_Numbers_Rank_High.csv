The number of former Georgetown students spending their time in the Peace Corps rose this year with a total of  alumni serving overseas PERIOD

Georgetowns international focus combined with the universitys strong emphasis on service inspires many to seek out oversees service opportunities students say PERIOD

I dont think Georgetowns rank is surprising at all PERIOD The Jesuit education system puts an emphasis on students becoming men and women for others  and that is something that the Peace Corps really embodies Grace Boyan SFS  who is considering joining the Peace Corps said in an email PERIOD

Alison McReynolds Georgetowns campus recruiter for the Peace Corps and a former volunteer agreed PERIOD

I think joining the Peace Corps aligns with the mentality of the university and the goals of the students who go there she said PERIOD

The university ranks tenth in the medium colleges and universities category this year for the number of alumni serving in the Peace Corps PERIOD Georgetown fell two places from its eighth position in the medium schools category last year though the actual number of volunteers has risen from last years  PERIOD The George Washington University finished first in the same category for the third year in a row and American University took fourth place PERIOD Since the establishment of the Peace Corps in   Georgetown alumni have served as volunteers PERIOD

Peace Corps volunteers have a variety of reasons for choosing to work abroad including learning about different cultures and participating in community development PERIOD

Stephen Chapman the Peace Corps public affairs specialist said that spending time in a foreign country is valuable PERIOD

I think one of the most interesting things is seeing how people live outside of the United States Stephen Chapman said PERIOD

Boyan also emphasized the experience of living abroad as a primary reason for joining PERIOD

I think the biggest motivation for me and maybe for others is the chance to form connections and build relationships with people and really become a part of a very different type of community by helping them out in any way that I can she said PERIOD

The Peace Corps recruits from all four undergraduate schools and nearly every major at Georgetown McReynolds said PERIOD

According to Chapman there is a great deal of diversity in applicant backgrounds because there is such a wide array of jobs available to Peace Corps volunteers PERIOD Some possibilities include work in education youth and community development health business information and communications technology and agriculture PERIOD
