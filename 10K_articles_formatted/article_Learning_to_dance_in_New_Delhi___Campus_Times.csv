The motivation to study abroad is a simple one visit another country experience another culture PERIOD The extent of how much a student immerses themselves is up to them but no one goes abroad to live like a Rochesterian PERIOD

One popular location to study abroad is India PERIOD The drastically differentyet gorgeousculture attracts many a student to immerse themselves in a onceinalifetime experience PERIOD

Junior Elisa Barton studied abroad in New Delhi during Spring  as part of the IES Abroad program PERIOD To her the motivation to study in India was simple PERIOD I chose this program because I wanted to go to India and it was easy to transition to that program because financial aid and credit transfers were relatively simple. this program was very good at integrating us into Delhi life and teaching us how to be independent yet safe within the huge crowded city of  million people she said about the program PERIOD Because the IES program in New Delhi does not offer classes in Bartons major public health she instead decided to take classes that immersed her in Indian culture PERIOD

She noted that one of her favorite classes was Classic KathakKathak being one form of Indian Classical Dancebecause she thinks its a beautiful and elegant type of dance with a huge history so she wanted to try something new and expand her dance repertoire says Barton PERIOD It opened my perspective to appreciation of the arts and artists who dedicate their entire lives to dancing. she also wanted to take advantage of the class assignments to immerse in Indian arts PERIOD Part of our assignment was to attend seven classical music or dance concerts in Delhi and write reports about them PERIOD Whats great about Delhi is that there is a classical music concert held almost every day plus all of the performances are freeAll of the performances from Odissi to vocal were super inspiring and filled with talent I couldnt handle. regarding the impact that learning Kathak had on her as a dancer and as a person Barton said that it definitely opened her to new ideas and techniques to dance to emote with the face and the delicate symbols for example a flower that our hands can make. learning Kathak was not just a new dance style it required us to learn a completely new culture and religioncoming from a different way of learning dance we were unexposed to the spiritual historical and traditional aspects of dance that are connected to classical Indian dance Barton reflected PERIOD

To those that visit and even live there India is a magical place PERIOD It has inspired many beautiful stories and movies that discuss its ability to change a person PERIOD Barton recounts her own experience of surrealism on a trip to Rishikesh in the foothills of the Himalayas It was nighttime and we were sitting on the clean sand a few feet from the calm bluegreen Ganges River PERIOD We could see all of the stars and the shadows of the mountain surrounding us PERIOD It was so quiet we could hear the Ganges river but couldnt see it PERIOD That was when I realized how little I was compared to everything else and also super appreciative of my journey there PERIOD It was a quiet and momentous moment of realization that when you follow your desires you can have anything. concerning daily life Barton notes that there were quite a few differences in expected behavior PERIOD For one she had to speak in Hindi whenever she went out to be taken seriously and not get ripped off like a tourist foreigner. she also admitted that she was stared at a lot by men and women because she stood out so it took a lot of patience and inner strength to get over the staring every time she stepped outside. for her India was an experienced that changed her as a person PERIOD

I became more patient with people and circumstances PERIOD I became more allowing of unwanted things and able to release resistance to things she cant control. overall for her the experience was an unforgettable one PERIOD I wanted to immerse myself in a culture very different than Western culture I wanted to make myself uncomfortable and go on an adventure and it was a whirlwind of emotions high and low PERIOD I would do it again in a heartbeat. kanakam is a member ofthe class of  PERIOD",Learning to dance in New Delhi - Campus Times,University of Rochester
