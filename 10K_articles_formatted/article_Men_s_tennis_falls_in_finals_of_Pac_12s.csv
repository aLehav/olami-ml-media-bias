5443,2015-04-26,"the No PERIOD  Stanford mens tennis team   Pac12 fell in the finals of the Pac12 tournament in a tight match against No PERIOD  USC   Pac12 on Saturday night PERIOD

The match was about as close as it could get as would be expectedfrom two squads that ended up sharing the regularseason Pac12 championship PERIOD The Cardinal had the upper hand for the majority of the match building up a  lead with a doubles point win and victories from freshmen Tom Fawcett and David Hsu on courts  and  respectively PERIOD This was another impressive display by the two freshmen especially Hsu who has gone  in dual play for the season PERIOD

However it was evidently not enough against the powerful lineup of USC all six of the Trojans singles players are ranked in the Top  nationwide PERIOD After USCs Nick Crystal pulled off a victory on court  No PERIOD  Eric Johnson outlasted senior John Morrissey in a    win to break the tie and seal the deal for USC PERIOD

With the win USC received the Pac12s automatic conference bid for the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

It was the third but possibly not the final match of the season between the two teams who have both played titleworthy tennis all year PERIOD USC took the first of the three with a  win at home in late February before Stanford struck back with a  win earlier this month PERIOD

Seeded No PERIOD  in the tournament Stanford had byes in the first two rounds PERIOD Its first match came in the semifinals against No PERIOD  California PERIOD The matchup was somewhat fitting for the Cardinal as Cals  win against them just a week before was the reason that Stanford had to settle for a share of the lead in the conference as opposed to winning it outright PERIOD

However the result turned out much better the second time around as Stanford handled the Bears with a  victory PERIOD The clinching point was delivered by none other than junior Nolan Paige PERIOD Paige lost his match against Billy Griffith in the  loss but in his second match of the week against Griffith Paige won    75and advanced his team to the finals PERIOD

Although Stanford missed out on an automatic tournament bid the teams prospects still look strong PERIOD After being ranked in the mid20s for most of the season Stanford should have no problem securing a strong seed in the 64team field and the win over Cal should only help the Cardinals case PERIOD

Tournament selection day is this Tuesday April  with the first round of the NCAA Tournament commencing on May  PERIOD
