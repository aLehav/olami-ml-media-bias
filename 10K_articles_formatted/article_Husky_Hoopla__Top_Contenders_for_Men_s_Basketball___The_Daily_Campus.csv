College basketball is back UConn is looking to take a step in the right direction on the mens side with Dan Hurley in charge PERIOD In a wideopen American Conference anything could happen PERIOD Heres a look at the conferences top contenders for the upcoming season PERIOD

Cincinnati The Bearcats are the team to beat in the American this season coming off a  season that led them to winning both the American regular season championship and the conference tournament PERIOD

Cincinnati suffered some of the biggest losses in the conference coming into the new season but their repertoire helps them remain the frontrunners PERIOD They lost  American conference player of the year Gary Clark as well as top guards Jacob Evans and Kyle Washington PERIOD But Cincinnatis sustained success has allowed them to rack up a line of players that step up each year in order to ensure that the Bearcats finish in the top portion of the standings PERIOD

Jarron Cumberland expects to contend for the conference Player of the Year this season PERIOD He averaged . points per game last year to go along with a shooting percentage of  PERIOD Cumberland will need to raise his game in order for the Bearcats to win the conference as they anticipate he will be the best player on the team PERIOD

But what can ultimately ensure that Cincinnati finishes among the best in the conference is the unbreakable defensive play instilled by coach Mick Cronin PERIOD Teams averaged just . points per game against them last season PERIOD After losing some stars they will look to ramp up their pressure defense further PERIOD

Cronin has built fundamentally sound teams year after year making it difficult to pick against them in conference play PERIOD He will likely take Cincinnati to its ninth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance this season PERIOD But what is in question is whether the Bearcats will be able to make any noise once they get there PERIOD Despite their continuous dominance of the American they have fared poorly in the NCAA tournament every year PERIOD Cincinnati collapsed in last years tournament as a No PERIOD  seed being upset by Nevada in the round of  PERIOD This years squad is less proven but behind Cronins system they should still have a strong shot at taking home the conference title PERIOD

UCF Favored in the  American Conference coaches poll UCF looks to make just its fifth tournament bid in program history PERIOD The Knights are the opposite of the Bearcats as they have little foundation as a source to project them to finish better than the rest PERIOD

Yet six conference coaches picked them to finish first in the standings PERIOD UCF finished smack in the middle of the conference last season with a mediocre  record in conference play PERIOD But they send a mature group into the new season and one that boasts senior guard B.J PERIOD Taylor and senior center Tacko Fall PERIOD The Knights are primed for their best run in program history with an experienced core of talent PERIOD Ceasar DeJesus Terrell Allen and Dayon Griffin round out the group as Coach Dawkins will look to take UCF deep into March PERIOD

The skill is certainly present for the Knights but whether it will all come together for a conference championship remains to be seen PERIOD While Dawkins assortment of players has experience on the college court they have little prior history in meaningful March games PERIOD Injuries riddled UCF last season as well making their potential to succeed an even bigger question PERIOD

It will be tough for them to take down a perennial conference leader in Cincinnati but look for them to contend through the end of the regular season PERIOD The program hopes to reach the NCAA tournament and win its first ever game there PERIOD

Houston The Cougars can be easy to forget about after falling just short of winning anything in  but they should not be taken lightly PERIOD This team will be hungry after coming so close last year and finishing in a tie for second with Wichita State in the regular season conference standings PERIOD

The Cougars are not as far off from Cincinnati as people often see them PERIOD They lost a close one against the Bearcats in the conference tournament championship game last season falling  PERIOD During the regular season they finished with only two fewer wins than the Bearcats in American play PERIOD

The loss of Rob Gray will sting for Houston but they are primed to continue to contend PERIOD Corey Davis Jr will take charge as they look to replace his nightly point totals PERIOD

The difference between who wins the conference will be who steps up for their respective teams PERIOD With Cincinnati and Houston losing some of their top players the door is open for a team like UCF to take the crown PERIOD But Cincinnati and Houston still have the firepower to come out on top PERIOD
