After letting yet another game slip away from them the Vanderbilt Commodores need to win both of their final two games to become bowl eligible PERIOD First up is Ole Miss who is coming off a  loss at Texas AM PERIOD

Here are three matchups to look out for on Saturday PERIOD

Williams has unquestionably been Vanderbilts best cover cornerback all year and he will need to continue that against A.J PERIOD Brown and the other talented Rebel receivers PERIOD Williams has three picks on the season and five pass breakups PERIOD He also has made  tackles and opposing quarterbacks tend to try to throw away from him as much as possible PERIOD

On a team full of many skilled receivers Brown has separated himself from the rest PERIOD He leads Ole Miss by a large margin in both yards and receptions with  and  respectively PERIOD He has clearly emerged as Jordan Taamus favorite target and shutting him down will be key for the Commodores to win this game PERIOD

Pinkney along with Kalija Lipscomb has become the guy to consistently make clutch catches resulting in big plays PERIOD He has  receptions on the season for six scores and an average of . yards per catch PERIOD His  225pound figure makes him a touch cover for anyone and he is just as effective in the blocking game PERIOD

One of the Ole Miss players in charge of controlling Pinkney will be Mohamed Sanago PERIOD Sanago is the Rebels leading tackler with  on the season good for third overall in the SEC PERIOD He also has forced two fumbles PERIOD

After a threetouchdown performance against Missouri Shurmur now has  total career passing touchdowns PERIOD Jay Cutler currently holds the record with  so Shurmur has a great opportunity to either tie or break the record this Saturday PERIOD His passing game will be especially key in this game against an Ole Miss team not particularly known for their defense PERIOD
