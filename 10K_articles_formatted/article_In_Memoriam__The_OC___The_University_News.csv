3644,2018-10-10,"i guess its a little sad to be nostalgic when youre  regardless I fondly remember a time when The O.C PERIOD was pretty amazing PERIOD The epic grandeur of Phantom Planets  O.C PERIOD theme song California blaring over the opening credits signaled the beginning of another potentially earthshattering episode in the lives of our favorite Newport teens PERIOD

I got hooked during senior year of high school after my little sister nagged me to watch an episode PERIOD I initially thought it was too much like a daytime soap opera the sort of thing I was obligated to dislike or risk abject taunting the following day when I returned to my allmale high school PERIOD Still I found myself wanting more of the FOX hit as soon as the closing credits rolled PERIOD

Before season two started my residence hall floor screened all of season one in a weeklong marathon PERIOD After that I was officially addictedso much so that among my friends every Thursday night became an elaborate guessing game about how each new wrinkle would resolve itself followed by heated debates from opposing parties PERIOD

To rehash a few of the highlights I called on my roommate Tony Cognata who watched the show from the pilot on and was a consistent presence at our floor viewings once season two started PERIOD We discussed the progressive character development of Ryan Atwood from whitetrash juvenile detainee to allaround decent guy Seth Cohen from nerdy loser to nerdy loser with friends the transformation of Summer Roberts from snooty popular girl to a decent human being and finally the descent of Marissa Cooper from popular and relatively innocent to raging alcoholic PERIOD These four characters served as the backbone of the show for seasons one and two PERIOD The show was also notable for its fine adult supporting cast which added depth to the proceedings with additional intriguing plot lines PERIOD

A few of the highlights that Tony and I discussed include the burneddown model home the catch phrasespawning pilot Welcome to the O.C. bitch the SethAnnaSummer love triangle the constant drama surrounding the RyanMarissa relationship Chrismukkah the beginning of Seth and Summers relationship and the season one finale PERIOD These phrases may not mean much to the unconverted but to those of us who spent time watching the exploits of these characters there are many good memories in which to revel in the first two seasons PERIOD

The music was also a major part of what made the show great PERIOD From the fitting theme song to the inclusion of music from a number of great indie bands The O.C PERIOD was one of the most musically conscious shows on TV Guster Spoon Modest Mouse and Death Cab for Cutie are just a few of the bands whose music was spotlighted on the show PERIOD Before they became crossover indie darlings Death Cab was mentioned as Seths favorite band on a number of occasions PERIOD

I remember The O.C PERIOD being compared to Beverly Hills  and being unable to understand the comparison because I was four when the latter first aired PERIOD Im a bit apprehensive that The O.C. much like Beverly Hills  wont amount to much more than another timely teen soap opera that fades from pop culture consciousness in a matter of years PERIOD It may not seem like anything timeless to critics and even to those too young or too old to understand it for me and many people around my age the distinct sense of time and place that this show captured wont be easily forgotten PERIOD

When I watched the show I was down when things were going poorly elated when things were going well and overall excited for the next episode PERIOD I wont deny that the show suffered a large decrease in quality even as season two progressed but now a week or so after the final episode has aired I feel little but reverence for a show that unlike most of what qualifies as mustsee TV meant something to me and my friends PERIOD It was our weekly escape to a teen fantasy land where beautiful people experienced the significant highs and lows of life with a great soundtrack as cultural accompaniment PERIOD
