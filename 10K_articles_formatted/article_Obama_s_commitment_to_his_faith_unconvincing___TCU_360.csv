1551,2009-01-16,"all TCU PERIOD All the time PERIOD

As we find ourselves on the eve of a new presidency I am reminded of how important it was to Americans for each candidate to establish his or her religion during the primaries PERIOD
Presidentelect Obama struggled throughout the campaign with rumors that he was a Muslim PERIOD When this turned out to be unfounded the religious liberal left confident that Obamas Christianity was as solid as theirs were off to the voting booths PERIOD
We are now left to wonder though how much his Christianity will be an evident guiding factor in his decisions during the next four years PERIOD
Will our new president pray publicly and hold Christian services on Air Force One as did his predecessor Will he seek religious counsel and have prayer meetings with world religious leaders
Or are such actions only a Republican form of Christianity
In the last eight years many openly complained about the extent to which religion was alive in the White House PERIOD I do not believe that we can expect such open worship from Obama PERIOD
Our new president will be more of a notsoinyourface sociallyconscious Christian rather than the evangelical presence which has been a cornerstone of the longreigning religious right PERIOD
Some may assert that faith is irrelevant to the American people but it obviously did matter during the YouTube debates and the QA at Saddleback Church where questions were formed by average Americans PERIOD
Politicians are using religion as a political strategy just as they may change accents in different cities on the campaign trail PERIOD
Obama is just Christian enough to tick off many of his constituents but not enough to win over the religious right PERIOD
Turning his back on his longtime pastor was a symbol of Obamas lack of loyalty to his faith PERIOD
When the Rev PERIOD Jeremiah Wrights sermons threatened his political campaign Obama denounced his comments and downplayed the message that he had sat and listened to for years as being outdated PERIOD
Obamas condemning response to an obscure passage found in Romans was an equally troubling sign PERIOD If he were as devout a Christian as he claims he should revere the entire thrust of the Bible and respect everything inside of it PERIOD
Christianity in America has become a cultural identity like a creed or a birthright but it is based more on our godless culture than the Bible PERIOD
As we evolve as a nation under new less religious leadership biblical Christianity in American culture will become increasingly offensive and words like evangelical will be derogatory statements PERIOD
I am open to rebuke and as a Christian I hope Obama proves me wrong PERIOD But whatever he chooses to do or not do Americans need to remember that our president is our leader and genuine faith truly is important PERIOD Only time will tell if the life he leads both as a confessing Christian and as a leader is worthy of Christs sacrifice on the cross PERIOD
