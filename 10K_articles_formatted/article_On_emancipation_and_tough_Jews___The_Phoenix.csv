8900,2016-03-31,"when I was growing up my mother would often extol the virtues of the tough Jew. the tough Jew unlike the garden variety does not take things lying down PERIOD He isnt a Woody Allentype anxiously cracking jokes in the office of his psychoanalyst whos been trying in vain for fifteen years to shrink his patients supersized superego PERIOD Nor does she let a bunch of jackbooted Germans put her on a train bound east without bloodying a few Aryan noses PERIOD The thing about tough Jews is that when they have problems they dont kvetch they shoot people PERIOD And the toughest Jews of all of course are the Israelis PERIOD

I dont want to write about Israel PERIOD Losing my voice from arguing late into the night is a semiregular occurrence for me PERIOD Im far too eager to inflict my opinions on anyone whos willing to listen and sometimes those who arent PERIOD In short I possess all the requisite selfabsorption and overintellectualism necessary for an opinions columnist in a lowcirculation college newspaper PERIOD But every discussion I have about the Jewish state leaves me with a strong desire to make a headshaped dent in the wall PERIOD No matter what position I take no matter what position my interlocutor takes I leave the conversation feeling angry irritated and above all guilty PERIOD The origin of the guilt varies I might feel like a selfhating Uncle Moishy an apologist for imperialist occupation or perhaps worst of all a blowhard perpetuating a loathsome and interminable conversation PERIOD Ethnoreligious conflict beyond being byzantine and bloody has always struck me as fundamentally petty PERIOD To be related to such a conflict however tangentially is to be part of a very highstakes schoolyard tussle PERIOD Its just embarrassing PERIOD

Yet at the risk of embarrassment Im going to write about Israel anyway because the Zionist movement offers a lesson on a subject Ive been tossing around in my head a lot over the last several months how liberatory projects can go wrong PERIOD Zionism despite the settlercolonialist rap its received from BDS activists cant be separated from its emancipatory content PERIOD The whole point of the Zionist project was to give selfdetermination to a scattered diaspora that throughout its history had been ghettoized pogromed and massacred by many of its host populations PERIOD The Ashkenazim of Eastern Europe did not make the First Aliyah to Palestine out of some laughable abundance of sentimentality they left the Pale of Settlement because the conditions of Jewish existence there had become increasingly intolerable PERIOD Thats why other Jews often idolize the supposed toughness of their Israeli counterparts PERIOD The appeal of that toughness isnt about macho posturing its about a willingness to seize control of ones own destiny PERIOD The independence afforded by the  declaration is nearly unprecedented in Jewish history for the first time in nearly two thousand years a Jewish community would be the primary shaper of its own future PERIOD

And yet the Zionist project for all its emancipatory sheen has been engaged in ethnic oppression throughout its existence PERIOD From its earliest days Israel displaced and murdered Palestinian Arabs PERIOD Today the crimes of the Israeli government are legion the continued occupation of the West Bank the expansion of illegal settlements and the demolition of Arab homes just to name a few PERIOD For Bibi Netanyahu and his conservative allies in the Knesset Israels parliament the point of Zionism isnt Jewish national liberation its Jewish national domination PERIOD

This way of thinking is I fear more a feature than a bug of certain kinds of identity politics PERIOD The line between national liberation and ethnic chauvinism is incredibly thin PERIOD A movement that seeks to emancipate one people can easily oppress another when it comes time to govern PERIOD In any struggle it is not enough for a movement to articulate the grievances of its own members alone PERIOD If it takes the prospect of victory seriously it must articulate a sense of justice that applies to all people for all time PERIOD



The spiritual father of the fanatical incitement against the Jews was Abner of Burgos a Jewish kabbalist and scholar who converted to Christianity in about  upon experiencing a deep religious and spiritual crisis and became known as Alfonso of Valladolid PERIOD His despair of the Jewish question found expression in his polemicssome written in Hebrew others in Spanishwhich contain a complete doctrine of denunciation of the Jews and their laws and morals PERIOD Oral Law he maintained constituted a code of robbery usury and deception PERIOD Various sayings by the Talmudic sages  were interpreted by this apostate to mean that the Jews must be deprived of the easy livelihoods of usury and medicine that they must be deprived of their autonomy and that they must be terrorized and subjected to harsh laws PERIOD Only then would they merit redemption. h PERIOD H PERIOD BenSasson A History of the Jewish People PERIOD

Prelude at Vassar College

Starting in late February the campus of Vassar College in Poughkeepsie has been the scene of some of the ugliest depredations yet organized by the BDS Boycott Divestment and Sanctions campaign designed to expel Israel from the family of nations PERIOD The college founded in the nineteenth century by a brewer has become a witches brew of bullying and raw violence carried out by Students for Justice in Palestine and its collaborators PERIOD They described themselves as staging an action italics mine on March  against the oncampus part of an International Studies class that was to include a trip to the Middle East to consider water issues in the region PERIOD Since the Jew and then the Israeli have been perpetually on trial it was considered necessary by Vassar to convene a special forum to consider the ethics of a course that would include setting foot in Israel PERIOD Although the trips itinerary confirmed that its predictably tendentious purpose was to convince students that Israel is unfairly depriving Palestinian Arabs of water that slander was not sufficient to protect it or its two gardenvariety Jewish leftist instructors from the wrath of BDSers who consider Israel the devils own experiment station or in the colorful lingo of Philip Weiss a Jewish hater of Israel in attendance at the forum a blot on civilization. their violence which included screaming interruptions and perhaps ululating was the existential realization of a letter published on March  by a group of thirtynine Vassar faculty members who condemned the Vassar administration for daring to criticize the recently passed resolution of the American Studies Association in favor of boycotting Israeli academic institutions PERIOD

The professors charged that critics of the ASA boycotters had had a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas and opinions. it is now almost  years since Lionel Trilling remarked in The Liberal Imagination on the way in which modern liberals not only want the right to go their own way in all things but to go their own way without any questions ever being asked of them PERIOD Those who carried out the action also had their special complaint PERIOD According to Weiss they were people of color perhaps by analogy with jeans of blue and therefore entitled to accuse their critics of racism. they understand liberalleft quackery only too well liberals think the poor are their equals in every sense  except that of being equal to them. but the final word on that allegation of chilled discourse was left to the gloating Weiss The spirit of that young progressive space was that Israel is a blot on civilization and boycott is right and necessary PERIOD If a student had gotten up and said I love Israel he or she would have been mocked and scorned into silence. matthew Arnold recalling back in  the happier moments of his second visit to America expressed pleasure that in colleges like Vassar College in the State of New York women the fair host of the Amazons were now studying Greek art and Greek literature PERIOD One wonders what he would say if he visited the same place now PERIOD I believe that what would most shock him would be not the bullying the intimidation the thuggeryto Oxford itself he had applied Byrons aspersion There are our young barbarians all at playbut the flagrant violation of conscience in intellectual work a violation like the following course description by Vassars Professor Joshua Schreier

History  The Roots of the PalestineIsrael Conflict

This course is NOT designed to present an objective account of a twosided conflict PERIOD The fact that there are supposedly two sides does not obligate us to portray each as equally right andor equally wrong PERIOD The goal rather is to understand why the conflict arose and what sorts of power inequalities have made it continue PERIOD  Why and how did economic globalization technological development and European imperialism foster the creation of two different national identities in Palestine Why and how and when did these two identities develop in such a way as to preclude members of certain religious or ethnic groups from belonging

Ruth Wisse has pointed out the impossibility of finding a course description at any elite American college or university that operated from the opposed ideological premise to Schreiers namely that the Jewish people had a connection to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean that was greater and of longer duration than the nomadic peoples who came to be called Palestinians and that the central place of Palestinians in world politics is due to an imbalance of power between the small Jewish state and the petroleumdrenched Arab states with which it must contend. when he wrote this description which apparently raised no eyebrows in whatever Vassar administrators pass judgment on curriculum Schreier was an untenured toiler in the colleges Jewish Studies Program now he is its chairmanand also a fact that may surprise some people the chief campus spokesman for the academic boycott of Israel PERIOD Here is how Lucette Lagnado a Vassar graduate reported the revelation in the Wall Street Journal February   The head of the Jewish Studies Program had also expressed support for the boycott movement PERIOD Prof PERIOD Schreier was quoted in the campus paper ruminating that while once instinctively against the boycott he had heard more substantiated detailed arguments in its behalf and as a result I am currently leaning in favor of it he concluded delicately as if choosing a favorite tea. selfhatred or selflove and apostasy

In his formidable book entitled Jewish SelfHatred  Sander Gilman showed how apostasy in the form of conversion to Christianity was the solution to their personal predicament chosen by substantial numbers of disaffected European Jewish intellectuals  PERIOD He concluded the book by suggesting that one of the most recent forms of Jewish selfhatred is the virulent Jewish opposition to the existence of the State of Israel. in the modern world however the contradiction between liberal pieties and the defense of Israel is rarely resolved by formal apostasy and it is difficult to find any selfhatred in such Jewish Israelhaters as Professors Noam Chomsky Richard Falk Judith Butler and Jacqueline Rose who suffer rather from a selflove that would shame Shakespeares Malvolio PERIOD They do on occasion cling to the outer trappings of medieval apostasy PERIOD Marc Ellis the wandering liberation theologian and former Director of the Center for Jewish Studies at Baylor University famously spent one Yom Kippur publicly confessing the sins of other Jews against Palestinian Arabs in front of a Christian audience at the Protestant Union Theological Seminary PERIOD He also praised the courage of Gillian Rose sister of the aforementioned Jacqueline for her deathbed conversion to Christianity via the Church of England. daniel Boyarin the University of California Berkeley professor of Talmud who has identified himself as a Jew destined by fate psychology personal history or whatever to be drawn to Christianity warned that My Judaism may be dying at Nablus Daheishe Beteen i.e. places the Israeli army had entered to pursue people inclined to massacre Jews PERIOD Noam Chomsky favors St PERIOD Pauls Cathedral in or in front of which he has often held forth in one instance introduced by another perfervid Jewish Israelophobe the late Harold Pinter who introduced Chomsky as the leading critical voice against the criminal regime now running the United States. lest that remark prove overly cryptic the everhelpful Chomsky had a few weeks earlier clarified Antisemitism is no longer a problem in the U.S. fortunately PERIOD Its raised but its raised because privileged people want to make sure they have total control not just  control. these however are but the dramaturgy the trappings and suits of woe where virulent Jewish opposition to the existence of the state of Israel is concerned PERIOD We see it more frequently and frighteningly in the BDS movement dedicated to turning the pariah people into the pariah nation by calling into question Israels right to exist just as the Nazis had called into question and very successfully too the Jewish peoples right to live. the leaders of this movement are disproportionately if not preponderantly Jewish apostates of a new kind that may well frighten us

I am the father of a Swarthmore grad and am old enough to be your grandfather PERIOD

You sound to me like a nice kid who has never been to Israel for more than two weeks

and likes to fit in with your friends and teachers many of whom are equally as unknowledgeable

about Israel as you are PERIOD

Let me offer you a different perspective on the situation PERIOD

For the past seven years Palestinians on the West Bank have had the sympathy and support of an American President fully in sync with their desire to obtain a state of their own PERIOD And willing to take unusual political risks to help them achieve it PERIOD

Yet in that time we have almost no words of compromise from Mr PERIOD Abbas and noneatall from Hamas for his efforts on their behalf PERIOD

Nor have we seen any real change in the determination of ordinary Palestinians to ultimately expel the Jewish people from their homeland PERIOD

Or efforts made to confront and displace their own corrupt political and religious leaders PERIOD

What we have seen instead are massive buildups of arms the building of tunnels stabbing attacks in Jerusalem rockets launched at Israel from Gaza the naming of day care centers in honor of vicious murderers and an enormous quantity of vile antiSemitic propaganda directly aimed at young people PERIOD

I use to believe that Palestinians were an accomplished people capable of doing difficult and important things but the evidence is proving me wrong PERIOD

They have on their front doorstep a neighbor who withdrew from Gaza a long time ago and who is immensely tired of war PERIOD

Making a final settlement with Israel will be difficult and will not be accomplished overnight but in the end it will prove to be a great deal quicker and easier than establishing a Palestinian state on the moon PERIOD

But that is where the Palestinian people and you with your profound misunderstanding of Israel currently are heading PERIOD

P.S PERIOD  Zionism is not a project PERIOD It is the dreams and aspirations of a people PERIOD

P.P.S PERIOD  Were it not for the tough Jews of Europe Hitlers project would have been even more

complete than it was PERIOD Jews should never speak casually of tough Jews PERIOD One never knows when you

might need them or need to become one yourself PERIOD
