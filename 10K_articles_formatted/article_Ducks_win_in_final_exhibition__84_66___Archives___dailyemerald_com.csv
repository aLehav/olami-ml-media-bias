7688,1970-01-01,"after Oregons opening exhibition victory against Southern Oregon last Wednesday coach Ernie Kent was adamant about the improvements his team will make on the defensive end in subsequent practices PERIOD

That didnt bode well for visiting Oregon Tech on Tuesday night as the Ducks defense hounded the Owls en route to an  win in front of  at McArthur Court PERIOD

Oregon playing in primarily a halfcourt trapping defense forced  Owl turnovers and held them to . percent shooting from the field PERIOD Point guard Aaron Brooks led the Ducks with five of the teams  steals PERIOD

I thought we did a much better job Kent said of the defense PERIOD Weve got a chance to be a really good defensive team if we continue to work in that direction. sophomore guard Malik Hairston recorded a doubledouble with  points and  rebounds and Oregon after a three by sophomore forward Maarty Leunen used an early  run to take command PERIOD Leunen finished with  points PERIOD

The Ducks led  at the half after utilizing their inside height advantage PERIOD Oregon outrebounded Oregon Tech  in the first half and  for the game PERIOD The Ducks also outscored the Owls  in the paint PERIOD Oregon shot only  threepointers compared with Oregon Techs  PERIOD

Coach is really emphasizing that we need to go insideout Leunen said PERIOD It will help the perimeter guys more because the defense will collapse and then we get dribble penetration. the Ducks built on the 14point halftime lead and held their largest lead at  with three minutes remaining in the second half before eventually pulling out the  win PERIOD

I think we came out with a lot more energy a lot more intense Hairston said PERIOD I think we saw flashes of what this team can do. andre Lawrence a senior guard from Portland had a gamehigh  points on  of  shooting to lead the Owls PERIOD

Hes creative worked hard and hes good at shot faking Leunen said of Lawrence PERIOD He just hustled and got his points. oregons newest member Ivan Johnson again had another statistically solid game down low for the Ducks PERIOD In  minutes Johnson finished with  points on five of  shooting and had two steals PERIOD He had a teamhigh  points in Oregons opening exhibition game victory against Southern Oregon in  minutes of action PERIOD

He has a high basketball IQ but he needs to grasp the total concept of what it means to play at this level Kent said PERIOD Theres probably about eight or nine plays that hes comfortable with  but hes done a good job with it so far. the Ducks still have work cut out for them before the season officially starts on Sunday against Savannah State PERIOD Oregon turned the ball over  times on Tuesday PERIOD

Were going to have some turnovers with how fast we play Kent said PERIOD I didnt think they were bad the first half but allinall those are things we can still clean up. oregon and Savannah State tip off at  p.m PERIOD on Sunday at McArthur Court PERIOD The game begins a streak of three consecutive at home in as many nights for the Ducks which includes Bowie State on Monday and Pacific on Tuesday PERIOD

Were definitely ready Leunen said PERIOD The season begins PERIOD The games really count PERIOD For us to get where we want to be we have to come ready to play and get these games. landrewsdailyemerald.com
