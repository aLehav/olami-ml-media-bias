Emily McConville  Wednesday February  

In the five days since President Donald Trump signed an executive order on immigration the approximately  Notre Dame students from the affectedcountries and the staff who assist them have been uncertain about their futures PERIOD

This is a big change a big sudden change Arman Mirhashemi a Ph.D PERIOD candidate in aerospace and mechanical engineering from Iran said PERIOD You dont expect it so you dont know what to do with it. the executive order issued Friday stops U.S PERIOD visas from being issued to nationals of Iran Iraq Libya Syria and Yemen for  days changes rules regarding refugees and Syrian nationals specifically and calls for a review of the visa adjudication process with the goalof preventing terrorism PERIOD

Notre Dame Internationals NDI Director of International Programs Rosemary Max said most of the approximately  students from the countries affected by the order are graduate students in STEM fields and many come from Iran PERIOD

In addition there are also a handful of faculty handled by the order as well as two visiting professors who were slated to arrive next week but now are most likely not able to enter the United States University spokesman Dennis Brown said PERIOD

While all the current students were safely on campus when it was issued Max said the order still affects them PERIOD

These are students who are busy doing amazing things for us she said PERIOD They have family members in other countries PERIOD Some of them have spouses in another country that they were hoping to go and see very soon and so there are questions about whether they will be able to do those things in the next  days or not and what will happen after that  we just dont know. the order sparked protests around the country including in South Bend PERIOD On Sunday University President Fr PERIOD John Jenkins released a statementcondemning the order as sweeping indiscriminate and abrupt and urging Trump to rescind it PERIOD

Saint Marys President Jan Cervelli also condemned the order PERIOD According to Mana Derekshani director of the Center for Womens Intercultural Leadership no students of the College are from the affected countries PERIOD

Soon after the order was issued students from the seven affected countries received an email advising them not to leave the country PERIOD Max said students were invited to come into or email Notre Dame International if they had further questions  but there was not much information to give in response PERIOD

For several days the status of people from the affected countries who have green cards was still unclear PERIOD The Trump administration said Sunday greencard holders would not be prevented from entering PERIOD

Some Notre Dame students who are citizens of one of the seven countries affected are also citizens of a country the administration did not name PERIOD Initially dual citizens were included under the ban but Max said dual citizens of some countries may soon be able to enter  but it isnt clear which ones PERIOD

Someone from the U.K PERIOD but who was born in Syria might be able to travel but its too early to tell she said PERIOD Its still very murky PERIOD I would say one thing is whats on paper and whats actually happening at the border  were trying to get our mind around those two things so we can see how best to advise our students. in addition Max said it isnt clear whether students can change their visa status from say a student visa to a work visa if they want to get a job PERIOD

That Mirhashemi said is a concern of many students setto graduate this spring PERIOD He said a common path for students after school is to get a temporary work visa in their field of study PERIOD

Everything is on hold  all petitions and everything for anybody with Iranian origin as well as the other six countries he said PERIOD

Unlike many Iranian students Mirhashemi who has been in the United States for seven years has permanent residency as opposed to a nonimmigrant student visa PERIOD But over the weekend he spearheaded an effort to write a letter to Jenkins expressing concern over the scope of the executive order and gratitude towards Jenkins for his statement against it PERIOD  students from the affected countries signed it   from Iran one from Syria and one from Iraq PERIOD

Mirhashemi who was involved in political and human rights activism in Iran said Trump reminds him of former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who was hostile to the United States in that both see the world in a binary. he said he worries the order is contradictory to American values PERIOD

When youre looking at the United States youre looking at a country with a rich history toward freedom and justice he said PERIOD So you dont expect this happens in such a country PERIOD I think part of my concerns from this are what is going to happen both for me and  its not only something that affects the U.S PERIOD It affects everywhere. max said she hopes Trump will issue another executive order clarifying certain points in the first order at which point NDI may host a forum to answer questions PERIOD In the meantime she said the University would continue to support those students PERIOD

International students  when they come here  there are so many barriers already to get here in terms of traveling visa expenses new culture  and so just maybe keep in mind that these are people who are quite resilient PERIOD Theyre great resources for our community and students should feel free to reach out to them and talk to them and welcome them again especially in this time she said PERIOD
