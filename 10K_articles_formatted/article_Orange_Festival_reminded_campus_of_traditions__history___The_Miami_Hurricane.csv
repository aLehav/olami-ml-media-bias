The University of Miami flooded its campus with orange on Friday to establishing and define the first year of its newest tradition PERIOD

Student Government SG hosted the first ever Orange Festival on the Rock and Green to remind the university of its history and traditions PERIOD

The lack of any schoolwide celebration in the spring prompted Melissa Guller SG chief of staff and Iron Arrow member to plan such an event PERIOD

The students  have a lot of pride in the U and  were all generally happy to come here she said PERIOD But I think were lacking on education on UM traditions. the event featured a book signing for Sebastians new childrens book Iron Arrow tappings specials at the Rat free orange food and shirts and a pledge campaign to not step on the seal PERIOD

There were also traditions tables where students can go to learn about different facets of UMs history as well as different facts about the campuss traditions PERIOD Anyone who goes to every table received a free orange shirt PERIOD

In order to involve more students many student organizations were asked to depict various traditions by painting a canvas PERIOD

Were going to have all of these really fun things but its not meant to be like Homecoming or Greek Week in that its competitive Guller said PERIOD

Additionally students with the craziest orange outfits had their pictures taken and uploaded to Facebook PERIOD The person whose picture received the most likes won a gift card to the Rat PERIOD

The biggest push was for people to wear orange said Jonny Diaz chair of the Orange Festival Committee PERIOD

The events themselves are nice but they can change Diaz said PERIOD No matter what club youre in no matter what school youre in the one constant in all of our lives is orange. diazs parents who both attended UM were thrilled when he told them about the new event that resembled Carni Gras an event they attended while in school PERIOD

It was a nice event to celebrate being a part of the university said Josie Diaz who earned her masters degree in accounting in  PERIOD

Carni Gras as Josie Diaz remembered it consisted of booths food and performances on the intramural fields to bring the university together in the spring PERIOD She first attended the event her senior year of high school while she was in the process of choosing her college PERIOD

It was a really nice event for the university and for  prospective students to see what its like to be a part of the Cane community she said PERIOD

When the festival ended both Guller and Diaz felt that the UM community had a better understanding and appreciation for the history of school traditions and that Orange Fest will evolve into a highlight of UMs spring calendar PERIOD

I hope that in  years everyone knows that the Orange Festival exists because the orange is the foundation of our colors Guller said PERIOD They know to wear orange the day before spring break and they know why we dont step on the seal or why the Ibis is our mascot. the Miami Hurricane is the student newspaper of the University of Miami in Coral Gables Florida PERIOD The newspaper is edited and produced by undergraduate students at UM and is published in print every Tuesday and online everyday during the academic year PERIOD","Orange Festival reminded campus of traditions, history - The Miami Hurricane",University of Miami
