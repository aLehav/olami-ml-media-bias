by  Kaitlyn WalekPublished  February  

University of Minnesota students now have another option for buying and selling used textbooks USwap.org  a website launched by three college students two from the University PERIOD

The website competes with more traditional ways of reselling textbooks but other bookstores said theyre not concerned PERIOD

At this point its a pretty small player said Troy Gerkey owner of theGo4Books store in Stadium Village PERIOD He said websites like Amazon.com operate on a larger scale and havent hurt his business PERIOD

Martha Hoppe interim director of the University Bookstores said shes heard of the website and encourages people to purchase books wherever they would like PERIOD

I think students have always exchanged books this just makes it easier Hoppe said PERIOD I dont think this is a new phenomenon. university students Nathan Shrader and David Ottman teamed up with John Bruer a student at St PERIOD Olaf College to create the website as a simple and direct way for students to trade textbooks PERIOD

They received help creating the technical side of the website from Northwestern University graduate Ethan Romba who created a similar website thats being used at Northwestern PERIOD

USwap uses the University of Minnesota Bookstores course information and allows students to compare prices of Amazon the Bookstores and students selling their old books PERIOD To use the site students must sign in with a University email address PERIOD

You can search by class ID and class number ISBN numbers for books and class title said Shrader the websites president PERIOD

By using course information from the Bookstores students can be sure theyre getting the correct book for their class PERIOD

USwap is already up and running but Shrader said he hopes to officially launch the website at the end of this semester or the beginning of next semester with marketing and partnerships PERIOD

Minnesota Student Association President Mike Schmit said MSA will be working with Shrader to launch the website and make students aware of it PERIOD

College affordability is one of MSAs top priorities PERIOD Schmit said members are looking for solutions like Shraders website that can be implemented immediately PERIOD

Im really excited that a lot of students might use it  I mean thats the hope Shrader said PERIOD

Its by students for students. students have mixed opinions about the website PERIOD

University student Gina Peterson voiced concerns about returning books online PERIOD

Part of the reason she buys books at the Bookstores she said is so she can return them easily PERIOD With the website though returns could be more difficult PERIOD

But University student Sadie Strassman said she was frustrated with the Bookstores PERIOD

I went to try and sell my textbooks and the Bookstores said Oh were not taking this anymore PERIOD Were not taking this one either. and I was like I bought them last semester I know the class is still going on she said PERIOD

Strassman and fellow University students Karissa Olson and Molly Rider all said they thought the website was a good idea and something theyd be interested in PERIOD

Some students have already used the website PERIOD

The site was extremely efficient PERIOD I searched my course number found the lowest price and emailed the seller said freshman Olivia Caringi who is in the same business fraternity as Shrader  Delta Sigma Pi PERIOD

She said she bought a textbook for  from the website while the Bookstores charged more than  PERIOD

I will be sure to sell books on there in the future she said PERIOD
