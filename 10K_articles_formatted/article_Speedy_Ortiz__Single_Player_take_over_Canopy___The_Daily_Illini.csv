After XXYYXX canceled due to inclement weather the remaining Friday night music performances of Single Player and Speedy Ortiz were moved to The Canopy Club PERIOD

Single Player a oneman band performed by Sean Neumann opened for Speedy Ortiz bringing his albums to life with the inclusion of an additional members Kamila Glowacki on guitar and supporting vocals Derrin Coad on bass and Jake Mott on drums PERIOD

A few minutes before the set began the crowd of around  seemed small for the festival but it gradually grew larger as time went on PERIOD

What seemed like an everlasting first song was actually a mash up of four PERIOD Opening with Graveyard Blues Pt PERIOD  which transitioned into Mary Todd Abbott and Older Single Player engaged the crowd with their highenergy between bandmates and loud amplification of the guitars PERIOD The audience started to show much more enthusiasm with cheers and jumping during the song  a catchy short and simple crowd pleasure PERIOD

Although new to the festival the band pulled off a tight set one with great energy and high engagement with the crowd PERIOD Being one of the better performances thus far Single Player definitely made a great impression for an invitation to next years festival PERIOD



Following their set that ended at  a.m. single Player quickly tore down their setup for Speedy Ortiz who took the stage at  a.m PERIOD

At this point the audience became much more congested in the front with large groups of people dispersed throughout the side seating areas and the balcony above PERIOD

Sadie Dupuis Speedy Ortiz frontwomen had an opening statement before the band started PERIOD

This is a late night for us this is normally our bedtime Dupuis said PERIOD But were very excited to be at such a cool festival. with the crowd cheering and yelling for them to start the band opened with heavy distortion that transitioned into American Horror a release off of their  EP Real Hair PERIOD 

Their distorted grungy guitar with loud drums reawoke the dozing crowd PERIOD The band stood very close to one another clearly engaged with each other on a musical level which resonated through their sound PERIOD Their performance was identical to their albums PERIOD

I really like them PERIOD I listened to their EP a few times and I loved it PERIOD Theyre putting on a great show said Jon Tracey a member of the audience and  alumnus PERIOD

The clearly 90s influenced band made me think of a louder frontwomen version of Weezer with clever lyrics where the vocals are more of melodic talking rather than full on singing PERIOD

Throughout the set the band segued into each song with heavy distortion pumping the audience up for what was to come PERIOD

A personal favorite of mine Basketball was performed with the perfectly executed bass line with supporting guitar PERIOD It was clear that Speedy Ortiz enjoyed performing this one the crowd digested their performance energy and no longer resembled a tired group of concertgoers PERIOD

Overall I was extremely pleased with Speedy Ortiz performance PERIOD A band I had been wanting to see since their  EP release of Sports I could easily see them again due to their energy and crowd engagement PERIOD

Although it is never fun to hear a highly anticipated performer say theyre tired their fatigue was unrecognizable and I was lost in every song they performed PERIOD

Closing with an extended noisy rock out I didnt want their performance to end PERIOD Im sure a majority of the audience wanted to see the highly anticipated XXYYXX but they definitely made up for its absence PERIOD

Overall the last two acts performed a night of good 90sinfluenced indie noise rock PERIOD Placing Single Player as an opener for Speedy Ortiz was a great combination and left me feeling like a 90s child all over again ripped jeans and flannel plaid in all PERIOD
