With only a month left of school its time to get serious about shopping PERIOD

Two months in meal plans start to run low and the options at the POD may start to get repetitive PERIOD Before you aimlessly walk the aisles of a grocery store trying to figure out what to buy make sure you remember the essentials PERIOD With a few items to stock your pantry picking food will be a lot less complicated and youll find yourself going out to eat and panicking over your next meal a lot less PERIOD

Peanut Butter

You simply cannot go wrong with a good jar of peanut butter PERIOD The nut butter is perfect for sandwiches toast smoothies and dipping pretzels or apples in PERIOD For a late night snack eating a spoonful right of the jar is a delicacy for some PERIOD Not only is it practical peanut butter is filling and a good source of protein PERIOD Cashew butter or almond butter work as alternatives or soy butter for those with nut allergies PERIOD

Bananas

Dont forget fruit PERIOD Bananas are the cheapest fruit and easy to store as they come in their own natural container PERIOD They are easy to add to a bowl of oatmeal or cereal to make it filling and nutritious PERIOD On their own they make a great snack or breakfast PERIOD

Avocados

People feel strongly about avocados one way or the other PERIOD They make a delicious filling snack on their own when eating with a spoon PERIOD The contents of an avocado mashed up can be a toast topping or the beginning of a good bowl of guacamole PERIOD While typically seen as a snack food Avocados provide healthy fat in a quick way that doesnt involve a stove or even a microwave PERIOD

Cereal

While some cereal contains more sugar than grains other cereals become one of the easiest ways to eat breakfast or any meal PERIOD Look for whole grain or whole oat cereal with seeds or nuts added PERIOD Some come soaked in honey or have dried fruit mixed in PERIOD Eat with milk plain as a snack or over yogurt PERIOD

Milk

Milk can go bad fast but is a staple for making cereal or oatmeal PERIOD Make sure to buy milk in smaller containers so you dont buy a big gallon that will go bad quickly PERIOD If you are dairy free or prefer a different taste almond milk or coconut milk is about the same price and serves the same purpose PERIOD

Hummus and veggies

One of the greatest snacks of all time hummus is a healthy minifridge option PERIOD The chickpea dip is paired with veggies such as carrots or chips PERIOD Similar to hummus chips and salsa is an ultimate afterschool snack PERIOD

Eggs

As one of the cheapest ways to eat protein a dozen eggs is a great thing to grab if you have a place to refrigerate PERIOD In your dorm kitchen scramble a quick egg for breakfast or make an omelet PERIOD All you need to make eggs into a meal is a few veggies and some cheese PERIOD Typically viewed as a breakfast food eggs make a hearty meal anytime of the day PERIOD

Protein Bars

Make sure to have a few protein bars you can grab when you sleep late and need a last minute meal on the way to class PERIOD A good protein bar is packed with vitamins and will give you the energy you need for the rest of the day from working out to running to the next place you need to be PERIOD

Spices

Salt and pepper are essential for most everything youll cook PERIOD Theres no benefit to eating eggs when you forget to grab something to season them with PERIOD Make sure to throw salt and pepper in your cart along with any other spice you enjoy from dried herbs to garlic powder to nutmeg to cinnamon PERIOD

Potatoes

Potatoes can take longer to cook but theyre one of the fastest ways to get full on a root vegetable PERIOD Sweet potatoes are a popular choice to throw in the oven for  minutes and then cover in sugar and butter afterwards PERIOD Normal russet potatoes contain similar nutritional values and can be cooked the same way then topped with savory options from cheese to pepper PERIOD Whether you decide to top it to perfection or eat plain potatoes are another way to eat healthy quick cheap and from a dorm room PERIOD
