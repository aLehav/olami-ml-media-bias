But these things can be difficult to truly feel PERIOD Our fastpaced society demands performances results and efficiency over reflection and thought PERIOD Consideration and analysis are traded in for subpar work that requires little brain power PERIOD Its draining but counterproductive PERIOD Some feel exhausted after a day of sitting PERIOD Others feel less than enriched because learning means memorization for shortterm storing PERIOD

But in my work at John Carroll as a student friend peer leader and advocate I have learned ways to mend a lifestyle that feels repetitive redundant and unsatisfying PERIOD However what I have concluded through my experiences is that reaching a point of fulfillment comes from being human PERIOD And being human stems from allowing room for emotions to be displayed PERIOD

How do we find methods to showcase and feel internal emotions This proves to be a difficult question that frankly has no concrete answer PERIOD But in my wise age Im  I believe that forming genuine relationships fosters the foundation for emotional growth and development PERIOD

Logically speaking emotional responses traditionally result from a learned experience associated with a specific event PERIOD For example you may fail a midterm and as a result you feel sad frustrated and begin to lack confidence PERIOD Or you go through a messy breakup and you begin to experience hopelessness denial or uncertainty PERIOD Sometimes it may be as standard as feeling nervous before doing some form of public speaking PERIOD Regardless of the situation emotions are learned through previous experience PERIOD But its essential to recognize that within those instances theres likely a relationship between you and someone else or you and your own mind PERIOD

So if we are seeking emotional tendencies that are authentic and healthy we have to look at our relationships first PERIOD Suppressing emotion signifies that our relationships whether interpersonal or internal are conflicted PERIOD Instead relationships should be formed on the basis of learning growth discovery perspective and understanding PERIOD

At that point your connections become more transparent and your thoughts begin to flow with admirable curiosity and wellroundedness PERIOD But once again this begs yet another question how do we form relationships to become human

For this question the answer is more concrete PERIOD Surround yourself with people that care PERIOD Find a crew that brings out your optimism and quest for kindness PERIOD Revive relationships that breathe life and energy into your soul PERIOD And for your own relationship with yourself as a human remember to have compassion and space for internal grace PERIOD Show love to your imperfections and commend your own ability to persevere and persist PERIOD

The more we focus on establishing genuine relationships with ourselves and others the more we can feel grow and live happier lives PERIOD
