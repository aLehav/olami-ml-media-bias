What Old Dominion fans and students remember prepandemic was brought back to S.B PERIOD Ballard Stadium on Saturday night in their home opener against the Hampton Pirates PERIOD Some may even say it was better than they remember PERIOD This was the win that welcomed Ricky Rahne into his new home stadium PERIOD

A game that the Monarchs were favored to win gave Ricky Rahne former Penn State offensive coordinator his first career win as the teams second head coach since the start of the program in  PERIOD He exuded a more tenacious energy that showed throughout the game compared to last weeks out of conference loss to Wake Forest PERIOD

Id like our team to be the toughest most physical most relentless team in the country he said PERIOD If people are going to describe us in three words Id like those three words to be it. with multiple school records broken Saturday night Rahne will settle into Norfolk with spotlights tied to his name PERIOD

Old Dominions offense rushed for  yards which was scripted in the way the night unfolded PERIOD The Pirates only scored in the third quarter PERIOD Along with a new rushing school record surpassing the previous record set in their inaugural season in  the Pirates were held to  total yards PERIOD This being a fraction of the total yards that the Monarchs scored was equated to a new defensive school record for the fewest number of yards allowed by an ODU team PERIOD

Quarterback D.J PERIOD Mack Jr PERIOD passed for  yards with completions to former Nittany Lion Zach Kuntz and anticipated freshman wide receiver Isiah Paige PERIOD The  season was canceled for the Monarchs due to COVID19 fears making this their first home win since August  PERIOD

The students presence didnt go unnoticed by the team either PERIOD

Students fans and alumni were eager to be back in the stadium as they longed for normalcy PERIOD The long and awaited day where Old Dominion football would kick off once again was not a quiet one PERIOD Students rarely found seats amongst the student section and were excited for what could be seen as a privilege of having a season PERIOD

This should just be a big party and let this thing game spill into Saturday night. rahne said PERIOD

The away game matchup next Saturday against Liberty will be a new opportunity to focus on scoring touchdowns and not settling for field goals in the red zone PERIOD

Rahne wanted to see more touchdowns when the team reached the red zone PERIOD

Too many field goals. rahne said PERIOD

Old Dominion set the tone for the kind of defense necessary for Libertys Malik Willis by shutting down the Pirates offense in a stark and evident win PERIOD The final score was  PERIOD
