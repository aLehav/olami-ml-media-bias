9398,2020-10-21,"this semester Deacon Dining has unveiled some new and ambitious food items in the Pit  such as UpDog Kombucha on tap Krispy Kreme burgers and vegan pumpkin porridge PERIOD



The Editorial Board of the Old Gold  Black applauds the Deacon Dining team for its creativity with respect to the menu PERIOD We are also deeply cognizant of the hard work that running a college dining facility requires PERIOD

However we would offer some constructive feedback to those designing the Pits menus PERIOD While keeping food options fresh and interesting is an important priority we also believe that highquality consistent options should be reliably available to students at the Pit PERIOD

For example several of us would prefer that the Deacon Dining staff prioritize perfecting staple menu items before other more ambitious and unusual items PERIOD For example we would rather be able to consistently be able to get a good piece of grilled chicken or have something other than rice and green beans at the vegan station PERIOD

While enjoying a unique food options can be a nice break from the monotony that sometimes accompanies the average campus dining experience there is also value in knowing that some of the most popular items in the Pit will be readily available and consistently prepared PERIOD

Again we do not intend to impugn the quality of the Deacon Dining offerings or the Deacon Dining staff PERIOD We know how hard the Deacon Dining staff work every day to provide the campus community with tasty healthy food every day PERIOD Rather we know that certain foods in the Pit have become something that students really enjoy and expect to be able to find when they swipe in PERIOD

Creativity in dining options particularly creativity that pays homage to local cuisine or the traditions of an unfamiliar cultures does have a place in Wake Forest dining halls PERIOD However consistency also has its place and students would benefit from knowing when they swipe into the Pit that they are guaranteed a favorite and familar meal PERIOD
