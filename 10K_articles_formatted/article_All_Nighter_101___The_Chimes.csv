As college is slowly coming to an end and I look back on all that Ive experienced  the ups the downs the good times and bad  I cant help but think to myself My goodness how many allnighters did I pull I knew from the beginning they would be unavoidable PERIOD Theyre the ultimate collegeworkethic stereotype PERIOD But it wasnt until I sat in deep reflection that I realized theyre more than just a stereotype PERIOD Theyre a way of life PERIOD

As we stare into the face of death final exam week Ive decided to devote my column to what I am sure has aided so many sleepless nights for college students near and far that which will continue to be there for us through the ups the downs the good times and bad and that which has become my personal knight and shining armor the ultimate allnighter howto list PERIOD

First I will define allnighter for all of you new students who got away with not pulling one PERIOD An allnighter at least in my book is any night where the sun comes up before you go to sleep PERIOD If the sun comes up at  a.m PERIOD and you go to sleep at  a.m. thats an allnighter PERIOD

The first ingredient in pulling a successful allnighter is motivation PERIOD There are lots of reasons why you could pull one but I think the best is homework PERIOD There are those nights when you realize you have a boatload of homework due the following morning and there is no way you can waste time sleeping PERIOD When one of those nights comes along youre set PERIOD Light the midnight candle but not in your dorm PERIOD

Here is what you need to do to stay awake

Drink coffeeteaetc. but not so much that you end up shaking PERIOD Just enough to keep awake PERIOD Caffeine makes your heart beat faster which keeps you going PERIOD According to Yahoo Health what actually happens is the caffeine goes directly to your brain and attaches itself to nerve endings blocking your bodys naturally occurring adenosine chemical from attaching to those same nerve endings PERIOD Your body releases more adenosine begins to panic because there is no effect and adrenaline is released in small amounts as a defense mechanism that increases your heart rate PERIOD It also helps to have a drink you like PERIOD Treat yourself while youre torturing yourself PERIOD I prefer Red Bull or Dr Pepper PERIOD

Eat a meal PERIOD You have to realize that you are extending your day to be about  percent longer PERIOD If you are on a threemeal diet an allnighter calls for at least one more meal PERIOD I find  a.m PERIOD to be a good time to eat PERIOD Its also important not to eat fatty foods that will make you sleepy PERIOD No one wants to jeopardize their allnighter with a sudden food coma PERIOD Foods with carbs such as cereal or pasta give you energy to keep going and will help to reduce any nausea from sleep deprivation PERIOD

Shower PERIOD Washing your face is good too PERIOD Cold water will refresh you PERIOD It also helps you stay clean PERIOD

Listen to music PERIOD None of the classical stuff PERIOD Loud music PERIOD Music with beats bass and blaring riffs PERIOD I usually go for something that is mentally stimulating PERIOD

If you can afford to take breaks PERIOD Ive found  minutes of surfing the Internet to be especially effective at refreshing my batteries between hours of boring monotonous homework PERIOD

As a last resort get up and walk around PERIOD Walking gets your blood flowing PERIOD If you are in your dorm and you are about to pass out on your desk walk around the hallway PERIOD It also helps you think in case your mind is about to explode PERIOD

All of these things are extremely helpful when you start to feel drowsy and the key to making them work is to spread out the various techniques over the course of the night unless multiple showers sounds like a good idea to you PERIOD

There are also things you should definitely not do if you want to see the sunrise

Dont lie down PERIOD Dont say you are just going to put your head down for a second because when you raise it up again it will be the next day PERIOD Your homework will most likely be covered in drool too PERIOD The point is to keep moving PERIOD

As I said before dont eat fatty food PERIOD A hamburger and french fries are not power food PERIOD

Dont turn the lights out PERIOD Any reminders that its nighttime and you should be sleeping are bad PERIOD Shine a flashlight in your eyes if you need to PERIOD

And last but not least dont be a wimp PERIOD You have to be hardcore PERIOD You want that allnighter PERIOD You need that allnighter PERIOD You will get that allnighter PERIOD

So lets say youve finished your allnighter and its the morning after PERIOD Its time to greet the new day with a big smile and say Hey all you happy wellrested wimps PERIOD I didnt sleep at all and Im OK with that. go forward with confidence remember to take your homework with you and be sure to catch up on your sleep PERIOD

Happy studying
