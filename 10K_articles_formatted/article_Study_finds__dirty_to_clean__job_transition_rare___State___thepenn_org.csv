Considerable cloudiness PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The Center Square  Though more workers have jumped in recent years from carbonintensive jobs  like natural gas extraction  to green jobs in renewable energy the numbers remain miniscule PERIOD

Fewer than  of workers make a fossil fueltorenewable jump while most end up in another carbonintensive job an unrelated job or find no work at all PERIOD

So argues astudyby economist E PERIOD Mark Curtis of Wake Forest University Layla OKane of Lightcast a labor market analytics firm and economist R PERIOD Jisung Park of the University of Pennsylvania PERIOD The trio analyzed  online work profiles to track workers who make an industry shift PERIOD

The vast majority of workers in carbonintensive jobs have not historically found work in green jobs they noted PERIOD Conversely the vast majority of workers obtaining green jobs do not come from carbonintensive industries but from a wide range of other industries and occupations e.g PERIOD Sales Managers Software Developers Marketing Managers. where a worker lives how old they are and how educated they are plays a role PERIOD

Overall workers without a bachelors degree are significantly less likely to transition into green jobs as are older workers e.g PERIOD workers in their 40s and 50s Curtis OKane and Park wrote PERIOD In some local labor markets such transitions appear exceedingly rare despite a large number of workers in dirty jobs who may increasingly face declining labor market prospects due to climate mitigation policies. in Pennsylvania workers tend to stay in dirty jobs rather than make a green transition PERIOD

The commonwealth ranks eighth overall in dirtytodirty job transition the authors found PERIOD Neighboring Delaware is number one while West Virginia and Ohio are nine and  respectively PERIOD

Pennsylvanias cities too struggled with a transition PERIOD Pittsburgh was thirteenth for dirtytodirty jobs and Philadelphia was fifteenth PERIOD

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection commissioned a report in  that counted almost95000 workersin the states clean energy labor market reflective of some rankings thatplace Pennsylvania highlyfor clean energy jobs PERIOD

Much of the growth in green jobs Curtis OKane and Park found came from solar  and electric vehicles  followed by wind  PERIOD

That could bode ill for dirtytogreen transitions in Pennsylvania however PERIOD

The statessolar and wind production is minimal and EV manufacturing isincreasingly concentratedin the Midwest and South thanks to state subsidies inIllinoisGeorgiaNorth Carolina and others PERIOD

The shift to more green energy could exacerbate underlying trends in labor market inequality Curtis OKane and Park noted PERIOD

The change threatens to leave older lesseducated workers behind PERIOD

We find that workers without a college degree and older workers are significantly less likely to transition into green jobs and more likely to remain in carbonintensive jobs they wrote PERIOD The high rate of employment persistence within dirty jobs in some localities suggests that there may be limits to the extent to which local labor markets are able to absorb the workers who will be displaced by the move away from fossil fuels. originally published on thecentersquare.com part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange PERIOD
