Senior Lecturer in history Dr PERIOD Jerry Jay Watkins III introduced the panel and discussed his current biographical study of John Boswell  PERIOD

First I want to thank some of the folks who have been involved in this Watkins said PERIOD Theres of course the Boswell Initiative the GSWS and Outlaw and Center for Racial and Social Justice as well as the National Lawyers Guild and all of the other folks who have contributed their time to putting this event on and organizing it. after Boswell graduated from the College in  and obtained his Ph.D PERIOD from Harvard in  he took a teaching position at Yale University PERIOD Boswells first book Christianity Social Tolerance and Homosexuality was published in  and left a lasting impact on the literary world PERIOD

He wanted to be remembered most for his faith but I think few have had such an impact on the field and have so profoundly shaped how we understand sexuality in the world PERIOD His memory is commemorated in a variety of ways across campus and across the world PERIOD One of the accomplishments I am most proud of is getting a building named after him. this book was really quite monumental Watkins said PERIOD The heart of the book is of course that Christianity has not always been so hostile to homosexuality and that homophobia is more socially constructed than divinely ordered. boswells book has been reprinted multiple times and has recently celebrated its thirty-fifth year anniversary of publication with a  reprint PERIOD By  Boswell was one of the first openly gay professors and department chairs on a national scale PERIOD He also founded the Lesbian and Gay Studies Center at Yale in  which became the Research Fund for Lesbian and Gay Studies by the 1990s PERIOD

He wanted to be remembered most for his faith but I think few have had such an impact on the field and have so profoundly shaped how we understand sexuality in the world Watkins said PERIOD His memory is commemorated in a variety of ways across campus and across the world PERIOD One of the accomplishments I am most proud of is getting a building named after him. hamilton began the panel discussion by addressing statistical data on transgender individuals in the United States and legislation surrounding transgender policies nationwide PERIOD According to the data shown . million people ages  and older in the United States currently identify as transgender PERIOD About  of these people are transgender youth from ages  PERIOD

Overall from data collected between  and now the number of trans adults has remained fairly steady but better data collection on youths gender identity has given researchers better information than what was previously available for estimating the youth population and now they know that youth comprise a larger share of the trans identity population than previously estimated PERIOD Now they comprise about  of trans identifying people in the U.S. Hamilton said PERIOD

Hamilton discussed issues facing the transgender community in the current day including bans on genderaffirming medical care and laws and legislation limiting discussion of sexuality and gender such as the Dont Say Gay bill in Florida PERIOD

Additionally efforts are underway to limit transgender youth participation in school sports and the frequent banning and censorship of books containing topics such as gender sexuality or individuals of color PERIOD

Young people have a right to see themselves reflected in their classrooms and in the books that theyre reading Hamilton said PERIOD

Hamilton noted a report from the American Library Association which found challenges against  individual books last year which is the highest number since we began tracking book bans  years ago PERIOD She added that a PEN America report found that of these books that have been banned  have had LGBTQ characters or themes  centered on transgender characters and  had BIPOC protagonists PERIOD

So students and their parents are facing these censorship efforts that restrict their First Amendment rights PERIOD Their First Amendment protects educators and students rights to exchange information PERIOD It also protects students rights to learn free from viewpoint based discrimination Hamilton said PERIOD

Its really just kind of stunning how much time resource and political capital is being expended on this issue PERIOD The Virginia High School League has already implemented rules that were implemented in  that allowed trans student athletes to participate with certain provisions. in the Virginia Senate two bills targeting transgender students failed on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD The bills would have restricted the participation of transgender students in school athletics and required school officials to inform parents if a child presents themselves as transgender in a school environment PERIOD The bills passed in the State House but did not receive sufficient support in the Democraticcontrolled State Senate PERIOD

Its really just kind of stunning how much time resource and political capital is being expended on this issue Hamilton said PERIOD The Virginia High School League has already implemented rules that were implemented in  that allowed trans student athletes to participate with certain provisions. mcKay then introduced herself and described her work as the executive director and founder of the He She Ze and We program PERIOD

What He She Ze and We does is really work to empower families on this journey of gender identity McKay said PERIOD And we work to support them to educate them so that they know how to be accepting and supportive to their kids of all ages PERIOD And we also advocate for the rights of transgender individuals. as the mother of a transgender child McKay mentioned her personal connection to the issues discussed as well as to families that may be grappling with their childs gender identity or hostile environments for transgender youth PERIOD

Your ego your belief system your biases leave it all there and come on in and open your door so that you can meet the person in front of you and help them with whatever it is they need help with McKay said PERIOD

She also discussed He She Ze and Wes impact on a broader scale mentioning that she has presented in front of the Virginia General Assembly to advocate for the rights of transgender youth and share her childs story PERIOD

Isnt that more of what were trying to do McKay said PERIOD Basic respect making people feel comfortable and welcome no matter how different they are from us PERIOD And if were all the same it would be so boring it would be so boring for all of us PERIOD But that is what were up against PERIOD Our families are struggling PERIOD Our kids are struggling in school. rosenthal then introduced herself and began by reading an excerpt from her book Living Queer History Remembrance and Belonging in a Southern City. the excerpt discussed Rosenthals time hosting workshops for transgender youth in Southwest Virginia PERIOD The excerpt later described the challenges and importance of discussing queer and transgender history PERIOD Many of the youth Rosenthal has worked with identified with some aspects of the stories they were exposed to PERIOD

We had created a space in which young queer trans people can act out not just the historical trans experience but also the words and lived experiences of older trans people to inspire them to explore their own teenage transgender lives Rosenthal read PERIOD This was a powerful demonstration of just how transgender history matters to young people today PERIOD Young queer people young trans people are able to see themselves in relation to that history in a way that allows them to bravely tackle the issues that they themselves face. unfortunately usually kids are doing okay with their level of acceptance PERIOD They get it if they would allow us to have representation in schools PERIOD Its the parents and the messaging theyre sending to school with their kids PERIOD That is the problem. the panel then opened up to previously submitted questions and questions from audience members PERIOD The first question was in regard to the importance of legislation and how it can protect transgender youth PERIOD

Unfortunately usually kids are doing okay with their level of acceptance McKay said PERIOD They get it if they would allow us to have representation in schools PERIOD Its the parents and the messaging theyre sending to school with their kids PERIOD That is the problem. hamilton followed with a comment on how representation matters within politics PERIOD

We need affirmative policy she said PERIOD We need policies where teachers and counselors do receive education and are given guidance on inclassroom best practices and how to support students PERIOD And in terms of curriculum development developing a curriculum that is inclusive and educates all kids. hamilton then asked her fellow panelists about the history of transgender medicine and the growing public fear regarding puberty blockers for youth PERIOD Rosenthal responded with her personal experience as a transgender woman who transitioned in her thirties and discussed the importance of hormone replacement therapy and validating medical care PERIOD

We also have a history of prescribing hormones and puberty blockers with cis kids long before this became an issue Rosenthal said PERIOD You may not be aware of this but it has been in practice and medical ethicists and parents and everybody thought it was a fine idea that if a young boy was growing up and was too short that they would prescribe a hormone to that kid to be taller because its more socially acceptable. rosenthal discussed how the historical use of hormones and puberty blockers strongly correlated with typical societal gender norms often prescribed to allow a child to conform to normative standards PERIOD

Its perfectly fine to do hormones and surgeries on kids to make them conform with our weird cultural ideas about the right way to be a boy the right way to be a girl Rosenthal said PERIOD But if a young trans kid was to use these same tried and tested procedures to make their body not conform with the idea of girl or boy based on outside sex then this is why were so scared. later in the discussion Hamilton answered a question regarding student and teacher rights in and out of the classroom PERIOD She emphasized the importance of freedom of expression and the panelists discussed the intricacies of teacher rights PERIOD

Hamilton cited the  Tinker v PERIOD Des Moines Independent Community School District case during the Vietnam War in which the Supreme Court ruled that students were entitled to wear black armbands to protest the war because they were exercising their freedom of expression PERIOD

Students dont shed their right to free expression at the door Hamilton said PERIOD So long as students expression does not unduly interfere with what is otherwise the educational mission of the school or the educational daily practice then students have a constitutional right to engage in that expression. since teachers are employees Hamilton highlighted some of the complications regarding school policy such as not being able to speak out against certain policies inside the classroom PERIOD

They can do it when theyre speaking in the context of being a citizen as opposed to being a teacherbecause theyre required to teach whatever the curriculum is whether its their favored curriculum or not Hamilton said PERIOD So there are all sorts of things that limit teachers. mcKay mentioned that many teachers fear losing their contractual benefits due to speaking out against school policy and Rosenthal emphasized the importance of making pedagogical resources to create transaffirming educational opportunities both inside and outside the classroom PERIOD

I think itd be great to be creative McKay said PERIOD Theres so many states now that are limiting what teachers can say but its still so important that we have that content in U.S PERIOD history classes or oral histories social studies classes and English PERIOD So I think it would be great for people to work on creating pedagogical resources to get that queer content in there in a way that feels safe for everyone. watkins concluded the conversation by introducing upcoming GSWS events at the College PERIOD On Feb PERIOD  GSWS will be offering an event on Performing Queerness in Singapore Beyond Illiberal Pragmatism and Cane with a Zoom guest speaker Zihan Loo PERIOD Additionally on Feb PERIOD  the A Home for My Heart event will address film screening around trans experiences in South Asia PERIOD
