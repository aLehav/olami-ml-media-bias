In  John Oliver invited dozens of scientists on his show to illustrate the statistics that overwhelmingly support climate change rather than sticking to the traditional one for one against model that news programming commonly featured PERIOD His point was that  percent of scientists believe humans are affecting the environment PERIOD However the disproportionate coverage of climate change deniers in the media conceals this statistic. i couldnt help thinking about this episode when reading Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos recent comments regarding Title IX PERIOD

DeVos addressed several of the issues related to sexual assault and harassment on college campuses PERIOD While DeVos clearly affirmed the need to confront campus sexual violence headon with each point about prevention and seeking justice for survivors she also added a point about those who have been accused PERIOD Dont get me wrong  no one should face a false accusation and universities should do everything in their power to ensure students arent wrongfully punished PERIOD Yet when DeVos gives undue focus to the accused particularly to those who have been falsely accused it depicts sexual violence on campuses in a different light and portrays a false sense of reality PERIOD College students are less likely to even report sexual assault in the first place compared to their noncollege attending peers PERIOD According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics about  percent of college student sexual assault incidences go unreported to the police PERIOD The percentage of false accusations though fiercely debated in the media is said to range between  percent PERIOD These numbers paint a very different picture than the one that showcases a falsely accused student next to every victim PERIOD

In a society already fraught with ideas like she was asking for it or she shouldnt have been wearing that it matters how we talk about sexual violence PERIOD And the reality is that students who have experienced sexual violence face a myriad of hurdles to heal and seek justice PERIOD

To take the first step in combating campus sexual assault the Obama administration released the Dear Colleague letter through the Department of Educations Office for Civil Rights PERIOD This letter provided guidance on Title IX by including sexual assault under the laws antidiscrimination policy PERIOD Essentially this pushed for further accountability of universities and aided survivors in having options other than pursuing a criminal trial PERIOD It also set in place the preponderance standard in which it is determined whether the evidence shows that the incident was more likely than not to have occurred PERIOD These changes were made to make it easier for survivors to come forward and many felt that they could finally feel like school administrators were on their side PERIOD

The media attention that resulted from this brought campus sexual assault to the forefront of many students minds PERIOD Movements such as Not On My Campus have helped students from a variety of backgrounds come together to help end this problem PERIOD Universities took greater steps towards implementing policies and procedures to help survivors PERIOD

Now DeVos seeks to have schools less involved in the process PERIOD DeVos said in her remarks that the Obama administration pressured schools to create systems that divest accused students of their rights PERIOD However the beyond reasonable doubt standard used during criminal trials and universities does not have the same powers as criminal courts PERIOD While they arent responsible for criminal punishment they are responsible for protecting equal education and Title IX cases fall under civil rights disputes in which the preponderance standard may be more appropriate PERIOD Sexual assault cases can be hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt with the majority occurring out of the public eye and with postassault trauma making it difficult for survivors to relive their experiences PERIOD

In its place DeVos is planning to implement a noticeandcomment process PERIOD One of the concerns she had with the Obama administrations approach was that schools have been compelled by Washington to enforce ambiguous and incredibly broad definitions of assault and harassment. decreasing the role of universities in the process not only provides less options for survivors but also takes a step back in making sexual assault prevention a priority in education PERIOD While its important that a fair process is provided for students on campuses completely taking away the progress of the Obama administration can send a message that survivors are not a priority PERIOD
