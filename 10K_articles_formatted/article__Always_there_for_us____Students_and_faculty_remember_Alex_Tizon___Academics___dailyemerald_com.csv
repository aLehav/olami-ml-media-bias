Correction A previous version of this article said Tizon was  PERIOD He was  PERIOD

University of Oregon journalism senior Shirley Chan wanted to end her time in college with a full circle have her last class be taught by the same professor who taught her first course at the journalism school  the class that convinced her to pursue a journalism career PERIOD

But Chan didnt know that her Reporting II class would be that professors last class too PERIOD

Tizon is remembered by many of his students as a professor who instilled a question everything spirit into his students and shattered professorstudent dynamics PERIOD

In Tizons courses class would take the form of a conversation PERIOD He would let students talk about what was going on in their lives that could be impacting how they were doing in class PERIOD

We kind of created a community which I really liked Childs said about her time in his Reporting II class PERIOD Tizon would get his students to share their work with the class and would critique them PERIOD People were sometimes a little embarrassed to talk about their work so we had to get used to that sort of setting Childs said PERIOD

Tizon would also give everyone in his class his personal cellphone number PERIOD

He would always much rather communicate on a more human level than just professional to student PERIOD So it was always really helpful to talk to him and reach out Chan said PERIOD He was always there and available PERIOD He was always there for us. tizon was born in Manila the capital of the Philippines and immigrated to the United States with his family in  PERIOD After moving across the country eight times during his K12 education from Honolulu to New York City Tizon finished high school in Salem before enrolling at UO PERIOD He graduated with a degree in political science and went on to earn a masters degree in communication from Stanford University PERIOD

Tizon had a 17year career as a reporter for the Seattle Times where he won a Pulitzer Prize in  for his coverage of a federal housing program for Native Americans PERIOD He also worked as a national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times reporting on such events as the September  attacks and Hurricane Katrina PERIOD Tizon has also contributed to the news TV show  Minutes coproducing a segment on mailorder brides in Asia and freelanced for Newsweek magazine PERIOD From  to  Tizon returned to the Philippines as a Knight International Journalism Fellow where he started crowdsourcing for the media to keep track of the Philippine governments efforts to alleviate poverty in its poorest regions PERIOD

He was a fantastic reporter and an absolutely brilliant writer said UO Journalism instructor Lisa Heyamoto whom Tizon mentored in  while she was an intern at the Seattle Times PERIOD But through all of that he would kind of pivot into a different kind of frequency of humanity than the rest of us. heartbroken to hear of the passing of alextizon a former colleague at seattletimes PERIOD Amazing writer PERIOD Hell of a guy PERIOD He will be missed PERIOD

UO senior Natalie Hardwicke another student will remember Tizon as a professor who was very supportive of his students PERIOD In teaching a profession that is often associated with being intrusive Tizon gave Hardwicke confidence to seek out interviews that arent always easy to get reminding her that it is her job to do so PERIOD She is in the middle of writing an article about Women in the NRA which Tizon took an interest in and was helping her publish PERIOD

We talked about it almost every day and just having him there giving me advice and able to work with everything it honestly made this term Harwicke said PERIOD He was phenomenal and I am going to miss him so much. tizon is survived by his wife Melissa Tizon and two daughters Maya and Dylan PERIOD
