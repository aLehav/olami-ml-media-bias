2635,2023-11-04,"the class of  has already made its impact on the UC Irvine athletics scene this fall PERIOD Freshmen are all over the place this season already contributing in unexpected ways PERIOD
Last spring we saw a huge presence from the  freshman class on the baseball team PERIOD Jeff Cusick contributed well off the bench and one of the biggest highlights of the historic season was when he hit a grand slam in the seventh inning to help the Anteaters rally from an  deficit and defeat the University of the Pacific PERIOD Sean Madigan hit a . average in  games and earned a Big West Honorable Mention PERIOD Eric Pettis told Coach Dave Serrano that he wanted the ball and was awarded a spot on the rotation PERIOD He was  on the season and even pitched . innings in two games in the postseason striking out six batters and walking four PERIOD After a rough season Christian Bergman valiantly took the mound against Oregon State in the elimination game in the College World Series PERIOD With almost no college postseason experience Bergman pitched five innings and did not allow a single earned run PERIOD
The freshman class played a huge part in the Eaters historic playoff success last year PERIOD This year they have not left off in other respective sports either PERIOD
Freshman Tanya Taylor was just recently named CoBig West Player of the Week in womens soccer the teams first honoree since  PERIOD She scored both UCI goals in a  victory over UC Santa Barbara PERIOD
Taylor has scored five goals this season but she is hardly the only Anteater contributing to womens soccers turnaround year PERIOD Redshirt freshman defender Caty Cope has tallied an impressive eight assists for a squad that rarely saw goals in their opponents nets all last season PERIOD Danielle de Seriere won the goalkeeper job early and has been impressive in the first  starts of her college career allowing eight goals and recording  saves PERIOD
On the mens squad freshmen have solidified their spots on offense and defense starting with goalkeeper Pat Barton PERIOD He has started nine games and helped the Anteaters win six games in that span PERIOD Freshman Gray Bailey is looking like a veteran player on the Anteater defense PERIOD He possesses a dominant defense style and an extremely dangerous throwin as dangerous as a setpiece play for the Anteaters PERIOD Coach George Kuntz is very excited for his future PERIOD Forwards Amani Walker and Spencer Thompson have shown flashes of a dynamic onetwo punch in the future PERIOD Thompson is second on the squad with four goals and has a knack for finding the ball and putting it in the net PERIOD Walker is a hustler he fights for balls and especially wins on aerial attacks PERIOD With a bit more game experience these freshmen could elevate Anteater play significantly PERIOD
The womens golf team has added two special talents to an alreadystacked squad PERIOD Hillary Packard finished seventh overall in her very first collegiate event and Sarah Fox finished twenty-third PERIOD These girls are very young and already establishing themselves as top tournament performers PERIOD
Last Thursday a freshman by the name of Brandon Johnson brought some lategame heroics with a clutch goal with one second remaining in regulation to lift ninthranked mens water polo over Loyola Marymount University PERIOD
The poster child for UCI freshmen is Kari Pestolesi who deserves her own article and gets one see page  in this issue PERIOD All I have to say though is that she is putting up Ryan Braunlike firstyear numbers Braun is the stud third baseman for the Milwaukee Brewers PERIOD
Freshmen are an interesting species PERIOD They either see immediate success longlasting success shortlived success or no success at all PERIOD It is very difficult to predict what a freshman will bring to a conference like the Big West PERIOD Where conferences like the Pac10 attract topnotch recruits the Big West does not get as polished or highlytouted players PERIOD
However the freshman play for UCI this fall has shown that even the freshmen in this conference can compete with the best PERIOD What UCI freshmen athletes lack in experience they make up in tenacious play PERIOD They are eager to show their talents and make an impact right away PERIOD They play with no sense of fear PERIOD They energize their teams and up the competition PERIOD
The Anteater class of  has excited us about the future and even the present state of UCI athletics PERIOD
