The Dailys Stanford Stickney spoke with Koll about his career and how he has navigated his first season at Stanford PERIOD

The Stanford Daily TSD How did you get involved in wrestling

Rob Koll RK My father was a wrestling coach PERIOD He was the head coach at Penn State PERIOD Of course back then you were a fulltime tenured professor and a wrestling coach PERIOD When I got the job at Cornell he asked me what I taught PERIOD When I explained to him that I didnt have to teach he asked me what I did all day long.It was different PERIOD My fathers experience was before they incorporated specialization in college athletics before they had to do any fundraising and before the recruiting process was as intense PERIOD I grew up in the Penn State wrestling room traveling around with him to events and tournaments and coaches clinics PERIOD Wrestling came kind of naturally to me PERIOD

TSD How did you get your first coaching job

RK I have to admit I never thought I would enter the coaching field PERIOD When I graduated from North Carolina I was getting ready to go to grad school because I did not know what I wanted to do PERIOD One weekend I was out of town working at a wrestling clinic in Cleveland and the Cornell coach called my home.Of course we didnt have cell phones back then and my wife answered the phone PERIOD Prior to that I remember rummaging under the floor mats of our car looking for spare change to buy a Subway sub PERIOD I was working as a barback working camps and clinics on the side everything I could do because I had one semester to finish up before graduate studies PERIOD I learned that she had essentially accepted the job for me when I called her back later that day PERIOD She was like Hey Jack Spates from Cornell called and you just accepted a job. we kid about it PERIOD She didnt actually accept the job but Im not sure I had a place to sleep had I turned it down PERIOD Three days later I was in Ithaca PERIOD

TSD What was your position when you first arrived at Cornell

RK I was the assistant coach PERIOD Cornell was a small Ivy League school in upstate New York and it wasnt much of a powerhouse at the time PERIOD And I remember asking the head coach if we were any good PERIOD He said No but were going to be.And it didnt take long PERIOD

TSD Arent you a fourtime AllAmerican

RK I grew up in a household where my father was athreetime national champion PERIOD He never lost a match in college PERIOD I remember him talking about his athletes and he considered good wrestlers as AllAmericans and great wrestlers as national champs PERIOD I never wanted to be just good. therefore the idea of being a fourtime AllAmerican quite honestly was not my goal.Until I finally won the title I was extremely unsatisfied with my career PERIOD Perhaps this is not psychologically the healthiest approach to the sport but it certainly helped me to ultimately reach my goal PERIOD I know wrestlers who set their expectations artificially low so as to be sure to achieve their goals but this is no way to go about becoming great PERIOD

TSD How has your perspective changed from a wrestler to a coach

RK I dont pretend to be the best coach in the country but I do believe I hire the best coaches PERIOD And when you surround yourself with great coaches and great athletes great things occur PERIOD Anything less than this is an exercise in mediocrity PERIOD

TSD Tell me more PERIOD

RK My strongest skill set is being able to procure the necessary resources to build a great program and to get other people excited about our vision for the program PERIOD At Cornell we were able to mobilize our alumni and friends to build the requisite financial infrastructure necessary to compete with any program in the country PERIOD This includes by far the finest wrestling center in the world PERIOD Theres no hyperbole in that statement whatsoever PERIOD I expect to apply this same model for success at Stanford PERIOD

TSD What are some of the challenges associated with coaching

RK Early in our days at Cornell other coaches would say They will never win there PERIOD Its too expensive PERIOD Its too academically challenging PERIOD You dont have the facilities. years later we were winning PERIOD All of a sudden those same people were saying Of course they are going to win PERIOD Its a great school PERIOD They have great financial aid PERIOD They have such a great wrestling room. its how you look at it PERIOD Every place has challenges PERIOD You just focus on what you have and turn your weaknesses into your strengths PERIOD

TSD Are there challenges at Stanford

RK People say you cant get kids in PERIOD I dont need  kids a year PERIOD If every year I cant find  or  outstanding recruitable athletes out of the thousands of prospective high school wrestling recruits then shame on me PERIOD Thats not the fault of admissions PERIOD Thats my fault for not working hard enough to find those kids PERIOD If Stanford can be nationally competitive in every other sport there is simply no excuse why we cant do it in wrestling PERIOD

TSD What drew you to Stanford as opposed to staying at Cornell

RKI wanted to be able to win a national championship PERIOD I felt like at Cornell Im going to contradict myself a little bit PERIOD There are certain environmental factors that make it more difficult PERIOD And after  years I felt that I was swimming upstream as to what more results we could get and I felt this was just a really exciting challenge to see if we could change and enhance the sport on the west coast PERIOD

TSD How do you plan to enhance the sport on the west coast

RK There is the ability to create major wrestling events and to grow the sport PERIOD This past weekend Penn State wrestled the University of Iowa at the University of Iowa and the place holds  PERIOD And there was every bit of  and a few more squeezed into that facility PERIOD Bay Area wrestling is not particularly strong although there are a lot of wrestlers out here PERIOD Its completely a holistic approach PERIOD We dont just focus on Stanford PERIOD You build the region PERIOD You help whatever you can do with the high school junior highs and youth outreach programs PERIOD Helping get high school coaches in the right programs and build a recruiting pool thats local PERIOD Its harder to recruit a kid from the east coast than it is to get someone from San Jos PERIOD There are over  high schools wrestling in the state PERIOD This is almost twice as many wrestling school programs as any other state in the country PERIOD Theres simply no reason we cant have a huge and loyal fanbase PERIOD

TSD How do you plan to create this kind of support

RK In our sport a lot of the following comes from people who wrestle PERIOD At Cornell I used this model and Im sure its the same at Stanford PERIOD Its significantly easier to get a high school peewee middle school wrestler or wrestling family to become a Stanford wrestling fan than to get a Stanford student who has never wrestled to become a wrestling fan PERIOD A typical Stanford student is busy as heck and has never heard of the sport outside of the fake pro stuff PERIOD Its difficult to get this population to come to a football game let alone to a wrestling match PERIOD Furthermore after a few years they graduate PERIOD Theyre gone and they tend not to stay in town PERIOD Whereas if you build your marketing toward someone who is eight to  years old youve got them for  years and youve got their whole family PERIOD If I get little Johnny andor Susie because womens wrestling is booming in this area Ive got the whole family  aunts and uncles and everybody else coming to the match PERIOD Thats what were also trying to do because I believe no true great program survives in a vacuum without a strong following PERIOD This is why Im obsessed with building that following building a fan base and making wrestling a revenue positive sport PERIOD

TSD Was it challenging receiving a program that was almost dropped

RK Just to put that in perspective wrestling programs at Princeton Brown Bucknell and Cleveland State just to name a few were all on the chopping block PERIOD The interesting phenomena though is all those programs are stronger now after theyve been dropped  every single one of them is stronger PERIOD And theres a reason for that PERIOD There was a call to arms and the alumni got behind them PERIOD And once you start writing checks the bigger the check the more you care the more you expect PERIOD I always compare it to owners of professional teams and I look at everybody who makes a gift to our program as if theyre owners now.If youre an owner you go to the matches PERIOD You help athletes with internships PERIOD You raise a ruckus if the program isnt performing well PERIOD When you have this type of involvement coaches are held accountable PERIOD Lack of accountability is a serious problem with nonrevenue sports PERIOD This was not the reason for Stanfords program getting dropped but at the aforementioned programs there was so little alumni involvement that when they all performed so poorly no one cared when they were dropped PERIOD Had those programs had full venues and an active alumni association the likelihood of them being dropped is unlikely PERIOD

TSD Where do you see the program in  years

RK We will be completely endowed much sooner than that PERIOD We will be producing national champions on a consistent basis and we will have athletes competing on the Olympic level PERIOD That is going to happen PERIOD It just a matter of is it going to be in three years or six years PERIOD

TSD What are you excited about for the rest of the season

RKOur big push is to increase our scholarship limit PERIOD Right now we are at five in half and we need to get to nine point nine which is our NCAA limit PERIOD I am excited about next year PERIOD We are bringing in  new wrestlers into the room and we only graduate one PERIOD Next year we are going to have a really big room that will make it that much easier for the kids to improve PERIOD

TSD What do you say to the young person who wrestles and wants to go to Stanford

RK At Stanford its not just the GPA  its the rigor PERIOD You want kids who push themselves academically PERIOD In terms of wrestling obviously we are looking to sign the top kids every year PERIOD Im always told that I need to find the diamonds in the rough.The heck with that PERIOD Its not that we dont want recruits that might be under the radar but if given my druthers I would rather start with a polished diamond PERIOD I dont think I have ever met an 18yearold who cant get better PERIOD Just because they are national champions does not mean they even come close to how good they can be when they become Olympians PERIOD We are not looking for good we are looking for great PERIOD We want to start with great and make them greater PERIOD
