Updated November     pm



Just when Denise Dy finally got one monkey off her back it appears another one has already jumped back on PERIOD

This weekend at the prestigious Intercollegiate Tennis Association ITA National Indoor Championships the UW senior captain upset Jana Juricova  the No PERIOD  ranked player in the nation  in her quarterfinal match Friday but the No PERIOD 4ranked player then fell to Southern Methodists Marta Lesniak for the second tournament in a row in Saturdays semifinal match PERIOD

It was just one month ago at the ITA AllAmericans  the first of three national tournaments this fall  when Lesniak upended Dy in a threeset firstround win PERIOD The two met in Saturdays semifinal and the result was the same  Lesniak came out on top with a     victory PERIOD

Dy certainly had her chances to advance to the finals for the first time in her career PERIOD She had a  lead in the first set and lost a tiebreaker PERIOD The senior also had a  lead in the third set but couldnt seal the deal PERIOD

 said Dy who was awarded with the tournaments Sportsmanship Award PERIOD 

Though Dy lost in her thirdcareer appearance in a national semifinal her clutch    win over Juricova was substantial for a number of reasons PERIOD Juricova a California senior had beaten Dy three consecutive times in three separate national tournaments and had also beaten Dy in the  Indoors semifinal PERIOD

 Dy said PERIOD 

She did more than that and did it in impressive fashion PERIOD Dy was down  in the first set but stormed back to take the set  PERIOD Still Juricova wasnt about to back down PERIOD

 Dy said PERIOD

Juricova took the second set  and that set up the decisive third PERIOD Dy had a  lead and then broke Juricova for the third time in the set to take down the nations top player PERIOD

Overall it seems as though Dy has snapped out of her earlyseason funk she appeared to be in last month PERIOD

 the senior said PERIOD 

Dy said that simply experience and playing time has been key to her return to dominance on the courts PERIOD

 she said PERIOD

The rest of the Huskies competed down at Mission Hills Calif. for the Palm Springs Classic PERIOD Out of nine total singles matches the UW came away with just two victories  one from senior Samantha Smith and the other from freshman Natali Coronel PERIOD

 head coach Jill Hultquist said.It was a learning opportunitybut a little disappointing at the same time. doubles on the other hand wasnt so successful PERIOD Three different duos lost their matches as the Huskies came away winless in the doubles department PERIOD

The informal tournament has no clearcut bracket and instead allows for preplanned and equally challenging matchups PERIOD

The Huskies will get some more fallseason experience next week at the Bulldog Classic in Fresno Calif PERIOD
