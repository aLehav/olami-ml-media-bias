Kalanithi navigates the philosophical dilemmas of the medical profession PERIOD

Elisabeth Kuguru  Contributing WriterOctober  

In the novel When Breath Becomes Air author and neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi weaves together a beautiful and touching story. i would recommend When Breath Becomes Air to anyone looking for a short read or thinking of going into the medical field PERIOD

Even though the reader learns about Kalanithis inevitable death in the foreword following his journey as a brighteyed medical student and his eventual battle with the same cancer that he worked to cure was still powerful and inspiring PERIOD

Kalanithis education was enshrouded in medicine PERIOD Yet he was able to take a philosophical and almost poetic look at his own disease as he grappled with his mortality PERIOD Facing death he wrote honestly I plod I ponder PERIOD Some days I simply persist. at the prime age of  Kalanithi died just as he was finishing his residency and more importantly right before his daughters first birthday PERIOD Although this novel ends with his death at its core it highlights and celebrates Kalanithis life PERIOD

Paul Kalanithi expertly recounts his experience revealing a different side to the medical profession that many people would not otherwise be able to see PERIOD I enjoyed how he delved into different bioethical issues seeing as how he struggled with how to tell his patients about lifethreatening prognostics PERIOD

He also had decided what kind of life was worth living PERIOD Kalanithi wrestled with his own guilt when he had saved a life only for that individual to live in a relatively vegetative state PERIOD

I think Kalanithi was able to open my eyes to many of the moral dilemmas that plague the minds of physicians that patients often fail to see PERIOD As such the transition that Kalanithi was forced to make from successful neurosurgeon to patient was heartbreaking PERIOD

Just as he was reaching a peak in his career he was struck by the same cancer that he had time and time again seen in his own patients PERIOD He knew exactly what his scans meant and knew he was facing death just like so many of his own patients were PERIOD

My biggest caveat with this book is that Kalanithi at times seemed to use philosophical language excessively PERIOD His language was oftentimes lyrical but sometimes teetered on the edge of redundancy PERIOD However his willingness to delve deep into his own humanity led to thoughtprovoking quotes like Death comes for all of us PERIOD For us for our patients it is our fate as living breathing metabolizing organisms PERIOD Most lives are lived with passivity toward death  its something that happens to you and those around you. our patients lives and identities may be in our hands yet death always wins. he continues Even if you are perfect the world isnt PERIOD The secret is to know that the deck is stacked that you will lose that your hands or judgment will slip and yet still struggle to win for your patients PERIOD You cant ever reach perfection but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving. i think Kalanithis life reminds us of the importance of living in the moment and understanding that suffering is just another aspect of life PERIOD He emphasized striving until the last breath and I think he did just that PERIOD
