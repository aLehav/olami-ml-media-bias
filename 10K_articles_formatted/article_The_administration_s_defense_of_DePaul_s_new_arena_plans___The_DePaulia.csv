Sam Signorellis column is clever but not accurate PERIOD Its use of Vincentian history to argue against the building of an events center is predicated on a false supposition PERIOD DePaul University has not received any taxincentive financing TIF funds from city taxpayers to build this events center PERIOD Period PERIOD

Rather the McCormick Convention Center is the recipient of  million of the citys TIF funds so that it could expand its operations and bring more conventions to the city thereby generating more tax money from convention business and visitors that will in turn enable the city to use those generated revenues for a variety of purposes and services PERIOD

The hotels and shops that are also part of this large project will generate additional tax revenue PERIOD DePaul has no role whatsoever in how either the City or McCormick Place finances their respective portions of the project PERIOD

DePaul on the other hand is financing its portion by paying  not receiving   million which will be generated by ticket sales fundraising and leasing out the naming rights for the arena PERIOD We anticipate using the center for  mens home games  womens games and three dates for graduation PERIOD Thats  days out of  for which we will have paid more than a third of the projects costs PERIOD

On top of that DePaul will be paying all gameday costs including rent for our use of the arena facility PERIOD Clearly DePaul is paying the city not the other way around PERIOD

Its hard to know what St PERIOD Vincent would think about all this PERIOD The Sorbonne from which he received his degree wasnt known for collegiate athletics PERIOD But Ill go so far as to guess that hed at least be pleased that DePaul found a way to pay its contribution to this project without adding a dollar to the students tuition or siphoning a dollar away from the university budget PERIOD

So many of our students are going to school working fulltime borrowing funds and relying on whatever support their families can provide PERIOD Its challenging to afford a serious higher education and we are a bit proud that a university with Vincent de Pauls name above the door kept its priorities in mind as it structured our contribution to this project PERIOD

One can reasonably debate whether the City should have employed taxincentive funds to expand the convention center or used them for other priorities including education PERIOD

Thats a fair public policy question but thats the question PERIOD And such questions need to be directed to the City PERIOD
