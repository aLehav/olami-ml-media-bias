The regents also voted to appoint Michael R PERIOD Anastasio a nuclear physicist as director of the laboratory which deals primarily in nuclear research PERIOD

The proposal comes after the university announced its partnership with corporate companies Bechtel National Inc. BWX Technologies Inc. and Washington Group International in a bid appeal to the Energy Department which owns the lab PERIOD The university bid will compete against University of Texas and the Livermore Calif.based nonprofit TriValley Communities Against a Radioactive Environment both of which have announced intentions to submit bids PERIOD

The UC regents said they were optimistic about the universitys chance to renew management of the laboratory which has been run by the university since  PERIOD

The UCBechtelled team is perfectly positioned to preserve the worldclass scientific mission of Los Alamos while maximizing the quality and accountability of the laboratorys business management security and operational functions UC President Robert C PERIOD Dynes stated in a press release PERIOD We at the university have recognized that the management of these laboratories in the twenty-first century requires a team effort one bringing together skills that are greater than what the university alone can offer PERIOD And we have put together a team that I believe is incredibly strong. the system also manages the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory PERIOD Congressional legislation passed in  put the three laboratories up for competitive bidding following the Los Alamos labs inability to account for . million in property and the discovery that another . million set aside for the lab had been misused on meal and travel expenses under UC management PERIOD Despite the controversies the university was recently awarded a new contract for the Lawrence Berkeley lab PERIOD

In the past there have been management deficiencies but the personnel at Los Alamos has been committed to fixing those problems UC Board of Regents Chairman Gerald L PERIOD Parsky said PERIOD Weve partnered with corporate businesses to focus on that management PERIOD But there is a lot of work to be done in between now and when we submit the bid. the lab has attracted national attention in the last two years following a series of security safety and financial problems under UC management PERIOD The lab was shut down for seven months after two classified storage devices were misplaced PERIOD However Los Alamos officials later discovered the disks had never existed and were a part of a computerentry error PERIOD The regents said they hope that the partnership with management firm Bechtel will put security issues to rest PERIOD

Obviously this is a brand new process for a private sector Bechtel National President Tom Hash said PERIOD We have to want it badly to win it PERIOD We are excited about working with UC PERIOD Its a marriage made in heaven PERIOD Were both working in our sweet spots UC in the science side and us on the nonscience side. the universitys involvement with the lab which manufactures materials used for nuclear arms and its partnership with corporations has caused protests by some students PERIOD At the regents meeting May  about  student protestors with headrags displaying Education Yes Bechtel No jeered at Bechtel officials throughout discussions of the lab bid PERIOD

Los Alamos is the nations largest laboratory responsible for nuclear arsenals and weapons components PERIOD

What our primary responsibility is right now is to maintain the critical expertise if this nation chose to go into a manufacturing mode in the future Dynes said PERIOD The numbers of nuclear components manufactured right now are very low. the maximum management fee will increase from . million to  million for the winner of the bid according to the Energy Department Request for Proposals PERIOD Though the Los Alamos management contract is possibly profitable Parsky and the regents made it clear that any profits would be returned to the lab PERIOD Energy Department officials have said that raising the maximum pay which is largely performancebased would provide incentive to strengthen both business and science at the lab PERIOD

Appointment of Los Alamos lab director in the event the university wins the lab bid was also finalized in last weeks meetings PERIOD Michael Anastasio who has more than two decades of experience in national security and nuclear weapons and has been leading the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory since  was chosen to lead the Los Alamos lab as director PERIOD

The regents will submit their bid to be considered by the Energy Departments July  deadline PERIOD
