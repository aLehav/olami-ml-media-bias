It seems like it was just yesterday that I was cruising down the road in the finest 12milespergallon utility van an American car manufacturer has ever produced the Ford Mark III conversion van PERIOD Id swing by the Shell station and fill up both tanks at . per gallon and then exchange friendly but still very masculine head nods with the guy filling up his Escalade at the next pump over PERIOD

These days its impossible for me to finish filling up my first tank before a brigade of Prius owners swarm around me and start chanting their mpg stats PERIOD Not that I can afford to fill my tank anyway PERIOD

But with rising gas prices and the subsequent sacrificing of our Mark IIIs comes a few underappreciated benefits that were all beginning to see

Less traffic on the roads PERIOD

The Federal Highway Administration has reported a . percent decline in overall road travel since the beginning of  PERIOD That means when the occasional drive to the grocery store is needed you wont be spending as much time reading clever bumper stickers while waiting for congestion to ease PERIOD



And studies by the Congressional Budget Office have demonstrated that people are cutting their trips when prices rise  a . percent decline in freeway trips for each 50cent increase PERIOD Its simple really PERIOD With less Mark IIIs on the road Prius owners have more of it to themselves PERIOD Maybe theyll shut up now PERIOD

Not only is that fantastic in itself but fewer cars on the road also leads to

Fewer traffic deaths PERIOD

Riding in an automobile is risky business PERIOD There were about  road traffic deaths in the United States in  PERIOD And if youre between  and  years old you fit the demographic for being most likely to be involved in a fatal auto crash PERIOD And according to an estimate prepared for Time Magazine if gas prices stay more than  per gallon for the next  months we can expect roughly  less accidents every single month PERIOD

Fewer Mark IIIs on the road also contributes to

Less pollution PERIOD

Oh yeah all you fuzzy green environmental types will love this one PERIOD Not only do we live in Pittsburgh the city that was rated as having the worst air quality in the country by the American Lung Association but wait isnt that enough Well its also supposed to cut down on the amount of deaths caused by pollutionrelated illnesses to the tune of  wouldbegoners in the next year PERIOD

What else can the Mark IIIs low mileage provide you How about

The fourday work week PERIOD

Thats right PERIOD Youve dreamt about it PERIOD Youve halfseriously suggested it to all your friends PERIOD Now its real PERIOD In an effort to save money and resources about  percent of Utahs state workers are seeing mandatory switches to fourday work weeks PERIOD Although many states are beginning to offer the option of the fourday week Utah is the first to institute it as mandatory policy on a large scale PERIOD

The projected benefits According to Brevard Community College President Jim Drake whose Florida school utilized the fourday week last year for its summer session more than  in energy costs were cut and the amount of sick leaves taken by employees nearly dropped in half PERIOD If you dont want a Mark III by now

I give up PERIOD Theyre really quite stylish for their size PERIOD Oh yeah and you can save money on your car insurance PERIOD

Since we harbor a shared objection to parting with our cash I know youll like this one PERIOD Since Im not driving my hypothetical Mark III to work anymore and instead riding my bike I now qualify for a change in auto insurance status PERIOD

By using Geico.coms online quote generator I ran my information through once as someone who uses public transportation to get to work then once again as someone who drives to work everyday all other details the same PERIOD Turns out Id save about  percent in my monthly premium as a public transit commuter PERIOD

Now Im out of letters PERIOD

Granted I dont enjoy seeing greedy energy companies lining their already bursting pockets by scamming consumers but look at the benefits more people alive healthy and not filled with roadrage PERIOD It almost seems worth it PERIOD",High gas prices might just be worth it - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
