A few clouds PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



All the political courtship comes to an end with the Iowa Caucuses Monday switching the focus of the media and political class from endless and varied polling data to definitive election results PERIOD

The final Des Moines Register poll was released Saturday showing Donald Trump leading the Republican field in Iowa with  percent PERIOD Sen PERIOD Ted Cruz RTexas was in second at  percent PERIOD Sen PERIOD Marco Rubio RFla. at  percent was the only other candidate drawing above double digits in the GOP PERIOD

Trumps position in the Hawkeye state seems to be a lovehate relationship with Trump only getting  percent as the voters second choice while Cruz got  percent of likely caucusgoers second choice PERIOD

Net favorability  measuring a candidates overall favorable rating minus their unfavorable rating  is also an issue for the Trump campaign PERIOD Trump had a  percent net favorability rating among likely caucusgoers meaning he has a high unfavorable rate PERIOD Comparatively Cruz had a  percent rating while Rubio was at  percent PERIOD

On the Democratic side the same poll shows former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reclaiming her Iowa lead with . percent a .3point lead over Sen PERIOD Bernie Sanders IVermont at  percent PERIOD

Clinton had a .5point lead over Sanders on Jan PERIOD  according to RealClearPolitics averaged polling data PERIOD

Ann Selzer has run the Des Moines Register poll since  and is widely considered the best Iowa pollster with a very strong track record PERIOD She has called  of the last  winners for both parties with an average margin of error less than . percent PERIOD

Iowa votes first in the presidential primaries due to its unusual and longstanding caucus system PERIOD The caucus is used in  states and is a more complicated process than just casting a vote PERIOD

Iowa is reflective primarily and almost exclusively of Iowa and nowhere else  if you wanted the first state to look and think like America Ohio would vote first said David Niven a UC political science professor and political speechwriter PERIOD If you wanted the first state to reflect the most extreme views found within the farming community then you would put Iowa first. iowans must attend public meetings at  p.m PERIOD local time Monday PERIOD Locations range from school gyms arts centers churches libraries restaurants and even fire stations PERIOD In all  precincts vote for a candidate which can take several hours PERIOD

Republicans and Democrats caucus separately and do so in different ways PERIOD GOP caucusgoers cast a secret ballot and the results are tallied locally then sent to the Iowa GOPs headquarters PERIOD

Democratic caucusgoers declare their support for a candidate and physically stake out assigned positions in the caucus room PERIOD That means Clinton and Sanders supporters will literally be in opposite sides of the room deliberating on the candidates merits PERIOD

Iowa is totally lacking in economic and ethnic diversity  this means that the results in Iowa can sometimes be wildly out of step with the rest of the nation Niven said PERIOD The media and the political class are desperate to measure the strength of presidential candidates PERIOD Far more than the actual delegates at stake Iowa is important because it is viewed as important. niven said that while a win may not be a sign of what is to come a loss can have serious impact on a campaign especially for longtime frontrunners Clinton and Trump PERIOD

What a bad result would mean is a huge surge of credibility for their opponents Niven said PERIOD A few early wins for Clinton could squash her opponents PERIOD A loss in Iowa could well mean Clinton will have competition all the way through the process.A loss in Iowa would really be a pin in the Trump balloon PERIOD Trump is unique in constantly talking about his own popularity  and its very hard for a braggart to take a loss. your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers",Talk stops now as Iowa goes to caucus | News | newsrecord.org,University of Cincinnati
