2823,2002-02-15,"baby its just not working out for me PERIOD Its not really something I want to do but I know that this is for the better and who knows  maybe well get back together some time in the future PERIOD But for now Im sorry I think we need some time apart PERIOD
I remember when I first met you PERIOD I guess I sort of knew who you were when I first got to Madison my freshman year PERIOD Id heard things about you from my friends but never seriously considered getting involved with you PERIOD
But as fate would have it I bumped into a friend of yours one fall afternoon and she introduced me to you PERIOD I remember that first meeting at Memorial Union where I got to know you and your friends PERIOD You were so friendly to me so welcoming it was really refreshing to be wanted by you PERIOD
Id spent the last summer pulling myself through a fog of depression and I really think you saved my life PERIOD I saw how you dedicated yourself to making the world a better place and how much you cared about everyone at UWMadison PERIOD I was happy with just a casual relationship with you but you really took me by surprise by wanting to take our relationship to a deeper level PERIOD
I have to admit I was pretty inexperienced with relationships like ours PERIOD But you understood PERIOD You pushed me gently and you taught me so much about myself and about the world around us PERIOD I know our relationship was rocky in the beginning but when I saw how together you and I could make things better for those around us I knew I had a keeper PERIOD
I loved how you made me want to be a better person to push myself to question my beliefs and to actually think about the world around me PERIOD What really made me fall in love with you though wasnt really what you did for me but rather watching how you dedicated yourself to serving those around you PERIOD
You were something special for that even though a lot of people who dont understand you liked to talk smack about you you stood firm in your conviction and dedication to serving those around you PERIOD I didnt care what other misinformed folks had to say  you were a teacher a listener and a provider PERIOD You were really something special and now I have to let you go PERIOD
I know we fought sometimes PERIOD You definitely took up a lot of my time and often times the effort and energy I spent on our relationship was exhausting and thankless PERIOD But I wouldnt have had it any other way PERIOD Thats part of your allure  you evoke reactions out of those around you PERIOD Even though were no longer together I know youll continue to challenge those around you to provide for those who need it the most and to serve the entire UW community PERIOD
I really didnt want it to come to this but its somewhat out of my hands now PERIOD I couldnt have seen this coming and theres no way to avoid it now  we have to go our separate ways PERIOD
It pains me greatly not to personally see a lot of our dreams and aspirations through to completion but I know youve got a great bunch of friends supporting you PERIOD I dont feel as bad doing this because I know Im leaving you in good hands PERIOD
I feel like a burden has been lifted from my shoulder but at the same time theres a little empty spot inside of me PERIOD Maybe hopefully well get back together in the future but its not your fault  its just not working out for me right now PERIOD Im sorry ASM its time for me to resign PERIOD

With apologies to Johnny Daly  though I never read the sports section Im told youre going through a similar breakup PERIOD
