Promising a speech that would be a a little bit different The Greenbrier resort owner and businessman spoke to his audience with down home sincerity vowing to forego the typical limitations of politics to make progress within the state PERIOD Throughout his inaugural speech Justice touched upon the Mountain States numerous problems such as the shrinking workforce declining education and raging drug epidemic PERIOD

Teachers Justice said are underpaid in the state making it difficult to fill classrooms with qualified educators PERIOD The problem with education Justice suggested is that there are too many bureaucrats in the school system PERIOD Though Justice was not explicit on his goals for education the new governor said that he has an education reform package he plans to submit following his inauguration which will eliminate unnecessary agencies and look at education in a different way. in addition Justice shared his hope that the state will welcome more competitive fields of work so that young people who wish to stay in West Virginia arent forced to move elsewhere because of a lack of opportunities PERIOD

We need to provide a place for our young people who want to stay to have the opportunity to stay Justice said PERIOD

Mister you dont have any idea how bad Im hurting Justice said the woman told him PERIOD

Justice also had strong words about the states overwhelming opiate problem PERIOD

We have a drug epidemic that is absolutely cannibalizing us Justice said PERIOD And whatever we have to do to stop it we have to do. at his inauguration Justice had plenty of support from his home county PERIOD In attendance were members of the boys and girls basketball team he coaches for Greenbrier East High School as well as students from Greenbrier County elementary schools PERIOD The Greenbrier Entertainers were also present closing out the ceremony with a rendition of God Bless America. members of the House of Delegates and State Senate filed onto the inaugural platform moments before Justice arrived with U.S PERIOD Sens PERIOD Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin joining them moments later PERIOD Former governor Earl Ray Tomblin spoke before Justice offering warm words and support for the incoming governor PERIOD
