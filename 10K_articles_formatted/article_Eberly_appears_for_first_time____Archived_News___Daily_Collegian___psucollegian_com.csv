 Eberly said after the game pumping himself up as he spoke PERIOD 

After being suspended Eberly said he slowly got back in shape by working with the scout team PERIOD Despite Eberlys efforts Penn State coach Joe Paterno said he wouldnt have brought him back this season if it wasnt his last season of eligibility PERIOD

 Paterno said PERIOD 

Eberly said he worked out all summer before going home for two weeks PERIOD During that time he got tendinitis in his left foot PERIOD In addition he learned he had an allergenic asthma condition that hampered his breathing when he worked out PERIOD

When he returned for camp Eberly failed to pass his conditioning test which consisted of running  40yard sprints under a specific time PERIOD Of the  sprints Eberly qualified on  of them PERIOD

Despite the influence of the injuries on his conditioning Eberly believes his coachs decision was fair PERIOD

 he said his enthusiastic aura unshaken PERIOD

Getting worked up as if he were about to fight for the heavyweight title Eberly said he intends to compete with the other tailbacks to gain more time PERIOD

 Eberly said PERIOD 

In your face

Before making his drivestopping flyingleap tackle of Illinois running back Elmer Hickman in the third quarter Lion linebacker LaVar Arrington helped sustain an Illini drive PERIOD

With the Illini facing a thirdandseven situation at their own 5yard line Arrington rushed Illinois quarterback Kirk Johnson and nearly sacked him before he released the ball for a short completion PERIOD

With arms raised to deflect the pass Arrington hit Johnson in the face and was flagged for a 15yard personal foul which gave the Illini a first down PERIOD
