Dear V

Ive been hooking up with this girl and shes really great PERIOD Well for the most part PERIOD When were having sex she avoids my eye contact like the plague PERIOD I understand not wanting to form an emotional connection but this is getting ridiculous PERIOD Seriously the sex is great and Im not willing to jeopardize it PERIOD Am I making too big a deal of this Should I bring it up Or should I avoid the conversation like she avoids my gaze

Sincerely

Eye cant



Dear NotSoSeductive Staredown

Youre making a this a bigger deal that it really is PERIOD Eye contact is a really intimate action and since you two are just hooking up you staring her down midthrust is possibly making her feel uncomfortable PERIOD That creepy kid in high school liked to stare  No one wants to sleep with a creep PERIOD

But if its something that helps you get off then you need to mention it. youre not asking for a middle school staring contest here just a little eye contact. surely she can send you a seductive glance or two while youre switching positions PERIOD

She could also just really hate eye contact in general. in that case start switching up how you two have sex. some positions dont allow for eye contact. youll still feel great duh its sex but you wont have to watch her looking away every time you try to look into her eyes PERIOD Thats a serious turn off PERIOD Get behind her and you could both watch TV she sounds like shed be more interested in staring at the Kitchen Cousins than at your face PERIOD

If she doesnt like eye contact and she says no to your request for a little more dont press it. thats a surefire way to make her feel really uncomfortable and then you might not be getting any sex at all. wouldnt you rather be getting laid with no eye contact than taking care of yourself with RedTube Thats what I thought PERIOD



And remember  you can always close your eyes and fantasize that shes looking at you
