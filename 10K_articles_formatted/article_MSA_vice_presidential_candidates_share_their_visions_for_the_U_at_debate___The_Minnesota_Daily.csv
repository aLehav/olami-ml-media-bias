WCORRECTION Fridays Daily incorrectly identified the person who asked a question about Roberts Rules of Order PERIOD Former MSA Forum speaker Marty Andrade a Daily colulmnist asked the question

ith less than a week left before the election begins five vice presidential candidates for the Minnesota Student Association debated Thursday in St PERIOD Paul PERIOD

More than  students attended the event moderated by Amelious Whyte assistant to the vice provost of student affairs PERIOD

During the 90minute event at the St PERIOD Paul Student Center candidates questioned one another and fielded questions from Whyte and the audience PERIOD They also mapped out their vision for next years undergraduate student government PERIOD

Its time to get new minds in MSA and new ideas said Katy Tagudin one of the candidates PERIOD

Vice presidential candidate Alex Newman said his main goal is to change the fees process so students could choose whether to give student groups money PERIOD

We think the students should decide where their money goes he said PERIOD

Vice presidential candidate Colin Schwensohn said his campaign is focused on curbing tuition increases through legislative lobbying PERIOD Other priorities include creating a bus pass for all students he said PERIOD

Much of the debate focused on getting more students interested and involved in MSA PERIOD Several of the candidates said their campaigns reach out to a wide variety of students PERIOD

But when MSA Forum speaker Kevin Wendt submitted a question about Roberts Rules of Order  the accepted rules of meetings the Forum uses to keep order  vice presidential candidate Luis Garcia said insider questions such as that say a lot about the organization PERIOD

Its exactly that type of mentality that excludes people from MSA said Garcia who said his campaign will focus on tuition transportation and expanding student involvement PERIOD

Adam Engelman a cocommissioner for the AllCampus Elections Commission said he was pleased with the turnout PERIOD The commission brought the debate to St PERIOD Paul to increase voter awareness he said PERIOD

A lot of times the St PERIOD Paul students are overlooked PERIOD So we tried to bring something to their neck of the woods Engelman said PERIOD

At the end of the debate Whyte tried to lighten the tone by asking candidates to name their favorite superheroes PERIOD

Schwensohn said he prefers the Incredible Hulk PERIOD

He was always calm and collected on the surface but when he cared about something a lot he busted through his shirt Schwensohn said PERIOD

Students will elect new MSA leaders Wednesday and Thursday through online balloting PERIOD The Minneapolis Television Network will replay the MSA vice presidential and presidential debates Sunday and Monday from  p.m PERIOD to midnight PERIOD
