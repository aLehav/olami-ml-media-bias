But its not impossible PERIOD Students can take advantage of free oncampus events and venues with their university student ID known as a UCard PERIOD

Kimberlee Briggs a junior in sociology and theater said she thinks students underutilize free services at the U PERIOD She encourages freshmen to capitalize on the opportunities PERIOD

Its going to be more of a memory than staying in and watching Netflix is going to be she said PERIOD If it sucks  no loss PERIOD The risk and reward ratio is completely in your favor. briggs said she enjoys going to the Utah Museum of Fine Arts located on lower campus and Red Butte Garden the botanical garden in Research Park  both of which are free for students with a valid UCard PERIOD Students can also explore a world of dinosaurs and science at the Natural History Museum of Utah located by Red Butte which is free as well PERIOD



UCards also count as an ArtsPass meaning students can access most Film Department screenings School of Music performances and ballet and modern dance recitals PERIOD Free tickets are available for musicals and plays in the Us Babcock Theater Studio  and the Pioneer Theater Company PERIOD

Plays around the community can cost around  Briggs said PERIOD I saw Avenue Q for free when they did it at Babcock and its now one of my favorite plays. if plays and musicals arent for you the U also hosts two free concerts Redfest in the fall and the Grand Kerfuffle in the spring PERIOD The Union Programming Council also hosts Crimson Nights which is a free party for students with dancing and giveaways held a few times a semester PERIOD

ASUU the student government on campus and other organizations such as the Hinckley Institute of Politics host guest speakers panels and discussions open for students PERIOD

One of the most memorable free events I went to was a dialogue on police wearing body cameras Briggs said PERIOD Dont just focus on the fun free parties  go to events that are about wanting to make a change PERIOD Plays and shows and museums are great but be sure to expand past yourself as well. you can catch free movies at the Post Theater by the dorms with films ranging from My Neighbor Totoro to Silence of the Lambs. unlike the other events you do not need to show your UCard to enter and you can get candy and soda on a firstcome firstserve basis PERIOD

Each student pays fees that go towards funding these events and memberships PERIOD To find out about these free events Briggs said firstyear students should pay attention to posters and signs around them PERIOD

Talk to people she said PERIOD Like pages for student organizations on Facebook PERIOD Be in the loop  then you decide what sounds fun. emailprotected
