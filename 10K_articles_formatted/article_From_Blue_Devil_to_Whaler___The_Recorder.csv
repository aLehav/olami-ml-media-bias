CCSU Hosts Connecticut Supreme Court Hearings at Davidson Hall

For the past  years hockey has been life PERIOD Family vacations were considered to be time spent in a hotel room during a hockey tournament and when other kids were out playing other sports Joe Dabkowski knew that hockey was it PERIOD

That is why when Dabkowski the former captain of the CCSU club hockey team graduated last May he knew not playing hockey was not an option PERIOD

You should absolutely have a plan to fall back on like I have my degree and can go out and fend for myself if I need to Dabkowski said PERIOD But having it in my head that it wasnt an option not to play made me work that much harder to make sure I made it a reality. dabkowskis new reality is the life as a professional single A minor league hockey player PERIOD

Early fall Dabkowski was signed as a center for the Danbury Whalers the newly formed minor league team as part of the Federal Hockey League PERIOD

Dabkowskis contract is for the season and when it comes time he will either be resigned or will move on to the next step of his career but right now hes focusing on getting better and advancing his game PERIOD

I have a little bit of a learning curve to get through said Dabkowski PERIOD Im still learning and Im a little behind because a lot of guys have played in Division  schools and professionals but its one day at a time and hopefully Ill pick up something get myself better each and every day so I can go out and perform. the process began in March following the Blue Devils run at nationals PERIOD After hearing about the open try out Dabkowski sent in his information attended and got the call back for training camp PERIOD Training camp led to minicamp then main camp and eventually after months of training and preparation he made it through and was officially signed as a Whaler PERIOD

I was shooting  pucks a day and thats whats gotten me to this point said Dabkowski PERIOD I continue to do it I just love to be at the rink PERIOD Some people like to play other sports or do whatever but I just like being at the rink. as a Whaler Dabkowski takes to the ice each home game in front of a crowd like none he has ever played in front of before PERIOD A typical Saturday night game can draw in  fans to the Danbury Ice Rink PERIOD Fans who attend the games in green and blue who make noise even when the team skates out for warm ups and who wait in line after for autographs PERIOD

The entire atmosphere still remains bizarre for Dabkowski who still cant fathom the idea that someone other than his family wants to wear his number  PERIOD However skating on to the ice in front of the home crowd and pulling on a jersey with his name plate on the back for the first time makes all of his hard work worth it PERIOD

I cant think of anywhere else Id rather be especially first year pro said Dabkowski PERIOD Get a lot of support from the city PERIOD They want us to do well and its just a great place to be PERIOD Theres a lot of other places even other places higher levels than what Im at right now that dont have the same environment and Im grateful for that a game like tonight I loved going out and competing with everybody just building off their energy. as the season wages on and Dabkowski works to get back on track from injuries acquired early in the schedule it is evident that there is nothing he would rather be doing than playing PERIOD While his parents were telling him to go to college he knew in the back of his mind that hockey was the only option and being a part of the Whalers is the next step in his career PERIOD

Theyre very supportive and I appreciate all the support theyve given me because its been my dream Dabkowski said of his family PERIOD A part of me does it for them tooand the biggest thank you I can give them is to keep playing and keep having fun with it and keep getting better leave it all out on the ice when I can. the Recorder
