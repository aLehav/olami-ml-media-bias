As the clock ticked down on the Michigan hockey teams weekend all the Wolverines needed to do was hang on PERIOD No PERIOD  Wisconsin down  pulled its goalie to gain a sixonfour advantage in the final seconds PERIOD

Junior goalie Bryan Hogan kept a firm grip on the lead PERIOD He made two stops in the waning seconds and as the Yost crowd showed their appreciation they knew it was for more than just the end of the game PERIOD

It was the end to Hogans arduous start of the season in which he posted a . save percentage through  games PERIOD

During that time he had a tendency to allow soft goals at inopportune times PERIOD A puckhandling mistake by Hogan cost the Wolverines against Boston University and a couple of weak shots beat him on the fivehole against Miami Ohio PERIOD But after three solid games  including Michigans sweep of this weekend of the College Hockey Showcase  it seems Hogan has turned a corner PERIOD

Now hes starting to look like the Bryan Hogan we know he can be and he showed that last year Michigan coach Red Berenson said PERIOD I think what youve seen early thats the end of that. hogan made  stops in this weekends two games which helped him earn CCHA Goaltender of the Week honors PERIOD Against Minnesota he recorded his fourth career shutout and first of the season PERIOD After needing just routine saves against the Golden Gophers Hogan was forced to step up and outplay Wisconsin goalie Scott Gudmandson for the win the next night PERIOD

Despite all the shots faced which included a 41shot Badger onslaught Hogan attributed some of his success to his defensive unit who limited secondchance opportunities PERIOD

Were not making as many mistakes coming out of the zone Hogan said PERIOD Its the ones we had when we were losing five games in a row where it would be breakaways and crazy stuff in front of the net that was tough to handle. looking for Shorties The Wolverines who struggled to score before this weekend came away with two shorthanded goals in the Showcase PERIOD

Against Minnesota junior Carl Hagelin jumped up into a rush created by junior Matt Rust received a pass and split the defensemen to score with the man down to nail down a Michigan victory PERIOD Sophomore Luke Glendening followed suit a day later with a shorthanded goal off a faceoff PERIOD

Obviously youre not supposed to score on the PK but I think ever since I came here weve been priding ourselves on doing a good job offensively Hagelin said PERIOD I think if youre a threat on the PK their PP might be almost scared to make plays. these are the first two shorthanded goals for the Wolverines this season but they shouldnt come as a surprise PERIOD Michigan finished with six last season PERIOD

I like to see shorthanded goals because they are backbreaker goals Berenson said PERIOD When you can score a shorty in a big game like these it just keeps the other team on their heels. showcase shutdown Those who made it to Yost Ice Arena for the College Hockey Showcase witnessed the last of its kind PERIOD The Wolverines will be on the road next season for the final year of the Showcase PERIOD

Originally created to keep old WCHA rivals playing on an annual basis the Showcase proved to be an imperfect fit for the teams involved PERIOD The games are always scheduled over the long Thanksgiving weekend when many students are at home PERIOD

The stale atmosphere was evident last weekend as the Yost ushers forced the small contingent of students that usually make up the entire west side of the arena to sit down PERIOD Even with the mellowedout arena Berenson said the team cannot drop from the schedule PERIOD

Do I think we should continue it Absolutely Berenson said PERIOD I was in on the initial planning of this tournament because I thought we should play Wisconsin and Minnesota every year PERIOD If I had my way we would play them each homeandhome. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
