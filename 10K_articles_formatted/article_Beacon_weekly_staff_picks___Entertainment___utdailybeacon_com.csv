Phish

Set your gear shift for the high gear of your soul

Is there anything more incredible than the live Phish experience I think

not PERIOD For those of you that dont understand what Im talking about turn

around and ask someonechances are they do PERIOD

The absolute raw musical talent presented by Phish is unmatched in todays

artists PERIOD One must respect a band that while producing the single biggest

concert event of  Big Cypress Fla. can still stand up for

themselves and remain clear of radio play and exploitation by MTV PERIOD Thats

right the reason you might not have heard of Phish is because youll

almost never hear a track on the radio and will certainly never see a

video on MTV PERIOD

Take this as a blatant plug for one of my favorite bands PERIOD If you arent

hip to Phish pick up an album thats a great place to start PERIOD Their music

is also readily available for download on many Internet sites PERIOD Thats

right Phish allows people to tape their shows and freely distribute them PERIOD

How then does the band make money On  tickets and venues that

consistently seat over  PERIOD And yes most of the shows are sold

out PERIOD

So come on Molly lets head for the show PERIOD I know you got my ticket

Iron Chef

Its become a weekly ritual in my house PERIOD The Friday night episode of

Iron Chef is quickly replacing The Simpsons and the staple for weekly

entertainment PERIOD

Iron Chef a show created in Japan is currently being presented by the

Food Network in the states PERIOD For those of you who havent seen this make a

date  p.m PERIOD on Friday nightsitll be well worth it PERIOD

The sheer magnitude of this production is enough to leave the viewer in

awe PERIOD Youll be immediately stunned and ask yourself Are these guys for

real Yes they are and thats the great part of this program PERIOD The Iron

Chefs are culinary masters selected by the shows MC Takeshi Kaga PERIOD Kaga

then puts his Iron Chefs up against culinary wizards from around the globe PERIOD

The outcome is an intense  minute food battle centered on a featured main

ingredient PERIOD

Iron Chef has all the appeal and grandeur of a Japanese produced show PERIOD

Cheesy American voiceovers add to the esteem making this the greatest

thing to come out of Japan since anime PERIOD
