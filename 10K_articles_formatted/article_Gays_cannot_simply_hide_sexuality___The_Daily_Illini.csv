2432,2023-10-26,"the arguments in Mr PERIOD Cruses opinion piece Gay is not the new black There is a difference are a reaction to the common saying that Being gay now is like being black in the past. i first would like to state for the record that I do not endorse the use of this saying PERIOD

Our struggles are unique although they do have parallels with a number of other civil rights movements PERIOD

My issue with Mr PERIOD Cruses article is his blanket statement that a gay person is able to hide the fact that she is gay PERIOD As an illustration Mr PERIOD Cruse states that a gay person can avoid being discriminated against in the workplace by remaining silent whereas a person of color cannot PERIOD

I acknowledge that the color of ones skin is directly observable and that this fact has consequences in our society whereas sexuality can theoretically remain hidden PERIOD



However remaining unseen is not simply a matter of not telling anyone. when we choose to hide the fact that we are gay from a single individual we have to take care to hide ourselves from anyone who might tell that individual and anyone who might tell that person as well PERIOD

Those of us who choose when and how to share our identities are constantly forced to make splitsecond decisions regarding the aspects of our selves that are safe to share in a particular context PERIOD

Although the observableunobservable dichotomy used by Mr PERIOD Cruse appears sound on the surface we have to look further to understand that surely the complexities of negotiating our hidden identities have an impact on our ability to perform to our full capacity remain safe and live fulfilling lives PERIOD
