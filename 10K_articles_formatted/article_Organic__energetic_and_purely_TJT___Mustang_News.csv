In the words of one of The Juliana Theorys TJT new songs Hold on tight now for the ride of your life because the rock quintet is coming to Downtown Brew PERIOD

Creeping up on their decadelong journey as a band TJT will perform at  p.m PERIOD today with openers Jamison Parker June and The Fury PERIOD The band is touring to promote its fourth release Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat which debuted Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

And for old fans and newbies TJT aims to simply give its audience eight years worth of music for an experience they wont forget PERIOD

We dont tend to do back flips and synchronize spins and moves or anything but we try to have a really good time and try to help everybody else have a really good time too lead singer Brett Detar said PERIOD Its really about connecting with people through our music. detar vocalist guitarist and keyboardist will share the stage with his longtime friends and bandmates Chad Alan bassist and the three Js of the band Joshua Fiedler guitarist Joshua Kosker guitarist and Josh Walters drums PERIOD

The band which formed in Pennsylvania in  united for similar reasons as other groups because of their early love for music PERIOD

I think that most of us are the kind of people that grew up with music as a part of our life from an early age Detar said PERIOD

For Detar in particular between his grandmother encouraging him to play musical instruments and his father in a singing group himself music was just a part of life PERIOD

But despite what many listeners would think Detar was nursed to the sounds of such Motown artists like The Temptations Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson which has contributed to the full sound of TJT PERIOD

I think its a bit of a stretch but in some ways not because I think that something that we always focused on are vocal harmonies and obviously theres a lot of that in Motown music Detar said PERIOD So maybe that was an influence subconsciously early on. but dont worry TJT is still all about rock n roll which is evident in Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat. this time we wanted to do it pretty much how we play Detar said PERIOD If you see us live itll be very similar to how we made the record. for instance on many of the new album tracks the drums arent always perfect Detar said PERIOD And thats no coincidence PERIOD

We always made records in the past that we didnt think really had enough energy or energy that came anywhere near the energy of when we play live together PERIOD It was always like Well well never capture that energy if everybodys shooting for perfection and doing things one at a time Detar said PERIOD It was all about having five people in the same room together playing at the same time trying to capture good performances as opposed to layering everything bit by bit. we set up and just wanted to make a rootsy album Alan said PERIOD We wanted it to be stripped down and organic. and making the additivefree style album proved rewarding PERIOD

I think that the record is a lot more exciting than any of the records weve made before because of doing it that way Detar said PERIOD

But has their music and lyrical flair suffered because of their experimental recording style TJT dont think so PERIOD

We still maintain our pop elements in the band because weve always loved hooky songs Alan said PERIOD Weve never made any extreme genre jumps and Im glad weve never become a band like that PERIOD We sound like what we sound for better or for worse. once the Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat Tour is over TJT will head to Europe with additional stops in Australia and Japan PERIOD

Weve basically been concentrating on supporting the record on the road Detar said PERIOD At this point were just trying to get out and play a bunch of shows. as for future plans Detar is just looking forward to playing an intimate show for his musicloving fans PERIOD

Thats the nice thing about small venues somebodys face is really close to my face Detar said PERIOD The school of rock that I grew up in that was what it was all about to get down and dirty with everybody. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
