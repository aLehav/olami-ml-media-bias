On Jan PERIOD   the state of Tennessee became the first state in the country to pass a prohibition law PERIOD This law banned the complete sale of alcoholic products in Tennessee taverns and stores PERIOD The penalty for breaking this law would have been a fine at the discretion of the court and the money that was collected from people found guilty was used to fund public schooling PERIOD In regards to public schooling the passing of this law had quite a unique effect on how our state and public university perceived alcohol PERIOD

Before going any further I would recommend checking out Tanner Hancocks Daily Beacon article titled History of Alcohol University of Tennessee published in  PERIOD His article gives a brief overview of the universitys relationship with alcohol PERIOD

The temperance movement started in the very beginning of the nineteenth century PERIOD It is commonly described as a period in which there was growing support to promote abstinence from alcohol usage PERIOD The temperance movement was crucial in the passing and ratification of the eighteenth Amendment in  which outlawed alcohol PERIOD

In much of the United States the temperance movement and prohibition led to an increased production of alcohol in black markets PERIOD In Knoxville prohibition led to organized crime and the ability for smallscale bootleggers to gain profits from the illegal sale of alcohol PERIOD

When looking at the impact of this law and the prohibition period in general it is interesting to make comparisons with our universitys alcohol policy and its effectiveness PERIOD For instance the era of prohibition warranted organized crime and did not effectively control the practices of the American population PERIOD The C.M PERIOD McClung Historical Collection within the Knox County Public Library holds multiple photographs that showcase the organized crime that occurred in the midst of prohibition PERIOD Citizens of Knoxville and the greater east Tennessee region were not ready to forfeit alcohol consumption even though there seemed to be a push for prohibition before the laws took effect PERIOD

Take this information and apply it to the University of Tennessee PERIOD The university is considered a dry campus which means that alcohol is not allowed on campus PERIOD There is an exception or two but the ability to freely consume alcoholic products ceases to exist PERIOD

Although there are rules against alcohol usage it is also inevitable that students break these rules PERIOD In fact there are forums on the internet that provide students living on dry campuses advice and tips on how to conceal alcohol at their universities PERIOD

The inability to truly control what the students do regarding alcohol is strikingly similar to the inability of municipalities to control citizens actions regarding drinking PERIOD Through this lens I believe we are given the perfect opportunity to ask why the university practices such an outdated policy PERIOD

What is sometimes promoted does not always accurately represent the reality of the policy and the values of the students PERIOD At the end of the day if a student is drinking at the legal age and responsibly shouldnt they have the opportunity to do so in the safety of their own dorm
