Its been quite the journey for Kianna Young PERIOD

Shes from Corpus Christi Texas which is a  mile over 15hour drive to Athens Georgia PERIOD But thats not the only journey shes been through PERIOD

Since arriving on campus in  Young has experienced a coaching change redshirted her freshman year and had to deal with not getting a majority of playing time during her first three years with the team PERIOD

Learning head coach Tom Blacks style took time PERIOD She was asked to do what she hadnt done before and it made her hesitant PERIOD

Before this season Young had a career average of . points per set and the best finish she had on the team for blocks was fifth PERIOD Through the first nine matches of this season Young has seen her points per set more than double to . and she is leading the team with  blocks thus far PERIOD

Young described her year as an exponential learning curve with the results being better than what even some of her teammates expected PERIOD

Shes always been consistent and stable junior Rachel Ritchie said PERIOD But I dont think anybody saw this coming PERIOD It was like she woke up one day and everything just kinda came together. the change seemed to be immediate PERIOD So when it happened everyone took notice PERIOD

We were joking once after she got just a gnarly kill Ritchie said PERIOD I looked over and was just like is this the same Kianna that weve had before

Youngs recent success hasnt only caught the attention of her teammates and coaches PERIOD After leading Georgia in kills for the first time this season against Long Beach State and Texas State she carried that momentum into a tournament sweep at the Blue Devil Classic where she was one of three Bulldogs to earn alltournament honors PERIOD

In Youngs eyes her past struggles are the reason she feels her play is at this current level PERIOD

It was kind of an internal struggle Young said PERIOD I was thinking I didnt pull as much as I thought I should of the previous years PERIOD I was trying to make up for it in a sense. still learning in her new role Young admitted that being in the program for four years doesnt correspond to a culmination of her potential PERIOD She even reaches out to teammates regularly for advice PERIOD

Meghan Donovan has been a good resource because she knows so much about her position Young said PERIOD Its good to be able to learn from both the coaches and other players. youngs level of confidence is growing with her play PERIOD Everything is looking up for her even outside of volleyball PERIOD She was eager to talk about her new castiron skillet to cook with PERIOD

After three years of sitting in the shadows of other players its Youngs chance PERIOD The journey has her here and the journey has her ready PERIOD
