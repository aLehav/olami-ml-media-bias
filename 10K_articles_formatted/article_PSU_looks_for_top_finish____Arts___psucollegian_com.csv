Penn State has never recorded a top10 finish at NCAAs PERIOD The best finish came in Dorenkotts second trip to NCAAs in  when the Lions finished eleventh PERIOD

Only two other times has the program finished in the top   thirteenth in  and fifteenth in  PERIOD

 Nelson said PERIOD 

With  qualifiers Penn State has the second most in the Big Ten behind Minnesota and is tied for the ninth most overall PERIOD Arizona leads all schools with  representatives PERIOD

Four members of the team provisionally qualified by swimming  cut times during the season but the times were fast enough to make it into the NCAA field PERIOD

 Dorenkott said PERIOD



But coming into the season Dorenkott said he thought his team was capable of sending anywhere from  to  athletes to NCAA championships PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

Last year Penn State also brought  swimmers to NCAAs and the team finished twenty-sixth PERIOD

OBrien who finished ninth in the 400yard individual medley last year enters this years meet as the topseeded Penn State swimmer as she is seeded fifth in the  IM PERIOD Skelos is the only other Lion with a top10 seed PERIOD She is seeded ninth in the  IM PERIOD

With Olympic Trials coming up in June Dorenkott said this field for NCAAs is the fastest in the history of the meet as swimmers have spent all season training for Olympic Trials in addition to their college meets PERIOD

But the focus of the swimmers is on themselves not the competition PERIOD
