Redshirt senior defensive back Erick Hallett III  tackles a Georgia Tech player during the Pitt football game vs PERIOD Georgia Tech Saturday night PERIOD

By  Dalton Coppola Sport Editor October  

Mother Nature reared its ugly head on Pittsburgh Saturday dumping rain on the City nearly the entire day PERIOD But it wasnt just the rain coming down at Acrisure Stadium PERIOD

The fans that weathered the storm at Acrisure Stadium were not pleased with the teams lackluster offense and made sure the team heard it PERIOD The Panther faithful rained down boos after the offenses ineffective drives consistently ended in threeandouts PERIOD

As the saying goes when it rains it pours PERIOD

Pitt   ACC turned the ball over three times and fell to the Yellow Jackets   ACC  on Saturday night PERIOD The Panthers went  on thirddowns and scored just  points against the Yellow Jackets PERIOD Head coach Pat Narduzzi said the loss is nobodys fault but his own PERIOD

It starts with me Narduzzi said PERIOD Theres no finger pointing in our locker room PERIOD It starts with me PERIOD Number one obviously I didnt do a good enough job getting them ready PERIOD Well go back to work tomorrow at  oclock with our kids and go back to get on to Virginia Tech. the Panthers have struggled to stop the run on the second level this year and that trend bled into the early portion of this one PERIOD Georgia Tech ripped off a few runs to keep its opening drive alive before a 33yard pass from sophomore Jeff Sims set the Yellow Jackets up in Pitt territory PERIOD The Yellow Jackets capitalized on the field position and nailed a 37yard field goal to pick up an early  lead PERIOD Senior linebacker SirVocea Dennis said he was surprised with how many yards the Yellow Jackets piled up PERIOD

 yards SirVocea said PERIOD Yes I am surprised at that PERIOD  wow PERIOD We just have to go look at the tape and clean up what we can. pitt didnt have much offensive success early on PERIOD On its first three drives the offense picked up a combined five yards and Slovis completed just two of six passing attempts PERIOD The Yellow Jackets surrendered . yards rushing per game coming into their clash with the Panthers PERIOD But offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti opted to throw the ball six times in the opening drives PERIOD

The Yellow Jackets offense wasnt doing much either after their opening drive PERIOD But a flurry of mistakes from the Panthers granted Georgia Tech extra chances PERIOD Senior safety Erick Hallett dropped a pair of interceptions on the first couple of drives PERIOD To make matters worse sophomore specialist PJ OBrien roughed the punter on fourthandlong to give the Yellow Jackets a fresh set of downs PERIOD

But the Yellow Jackets simply couldnt take advantage of the extra opportunities keeping the score at  PERIOD

Cignetti eventually decided it was time to run the football and it paid off PERIOD Senior running back Vincent Davis ran the ball four straight times for  yards finally finding some sort of rhythm for the offense PERIOD Just as it seemed the Panthers found their groove a false start penalty and a Pitt timeout put an end to another futile drive PERIOD

After Georgia Techs opening drive field goal the two teams had drives that ended in a punt on eight straight possessions PERIOD

On their sixth possession Pitt came within striking distance PERIOD The offense faced a fourthandfive from their own 33yard line and head coach Pat Narduzzi sent out his kicking unit to attempt a field goal PERIOD But he decided to burn a timeout and put his offense out there to go for it  it didnt pay off PERIOD Yet another Slovis incompletion led to a turnoverondowns giving the Yellow Jackets possession PERIOD

Georgia Tech took advantage of favorable field possession and kicked another field goal to tack on three more points PERIOD

On the ensuing drive Pitt flipped the script and took advantage of a couple of mistakes from the Yellow Jackets PERIOD A roughing the passer penalty on Georgia Tech set the Panthers up for a scoring opportunity PERIOD Despite his struggles early on Slovis composed himself and hit sophomore tight end Gavin Bartholomew for a 29yard touchdown PERIOD After a successful extra point Pitt took a  lead which it would take into the half PERIOD

After the first half both offenses combined for just  yards of offense and  points PERIOD The Panther defense kept them in the game picking up four sacks and six tackles for a loss in the first half alone PERIOD Slovis said he has to play better in order to help the Panthers win football games PERIOD

I think at times I shouldve been more decisive Slovis said PERIOD Tonight Ive got to play better for us to win. pitt came out of the second half and ran the ball well in its opening drive PERIOD The Panthers made their way into Georgia Tech territory but Davis fumbled and the Yellow Jackets scooped it up and returned it all the way to the Pitt 17yard line PERIOD But the Pitt defense refused to break and held the Yellow Jackets to a field goal PERIOD Georgia Techs third field goal of the game gave the Yellow Jackets a  lead halfway through the third quarter PERIOD

Slovis struggles continued in the second half throwing an interception which led to another field goal for the Yellow Jackets to extend their lead to  PERIOD Pitt took back over after the fourth field goal from Georgia Tech and promptly turned the ball over once again PERIOD Davis fumbled for the second time in the contest giving the Yellow Jackets the ball back in Pitt territory PERIOD

Sims didnt squander this opportunity PERIOD He led a four play 34yard touchdown drive capped by a 21yard touchdown to senior EJ Jenkins giving Georgia Tech a  lead PERIOD Pitt again failed to generate a threat on the ensuing offensive drive as the game slipped away PERIOD

With this one all but over the crowd began filing out of the stadium after the Georgia Tech touchdown PERIOD Slovis did give the Panthers some life after he led a 99yard scoring drive to bring the score to  PERIOD But it was too little too late PERIOD Georgia Tech added one more touchdown before the final whistle blew for good measure deflating an already small crowd PERIOD

The Panthers will have a chance to avenge this weeks loss next week against Virginia Tech PERIOD The game against the Hokies will kickoff at  p.m PERIOD and air on ACC Network PERIOD
