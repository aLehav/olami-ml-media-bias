3652,2018-10-10,"freshmen arent supposed to be leaders PERIOD They arent supposed to lead the team in scoring or be a critical component to the teams success PERIOD But Jamie Perry breaks the stereotype of a typical freshman PERIOD

Perry has been instantoffense for the Saint Louis University womens soccer team this season PERIOD She leads the team with  points on five goals and one assist and has started every game PERIOD But Perry brings much more to the team than just raw numbers PERIOD

Shes consistent every game PERIOD Shes helping to lead the team said coach Tim Champion PERIOD She is creating chances for herself and uses her speed and skill to beat defenders PERIOD Shes had an impact up top PERIOD That was the one thing that we needed. perrys success should be no surprise PERIOD She scored  goals in her career and added  assists at Rockwood Summit High School in Fenton Mo PERIOD

Perry helped lead Summit to conference district and sectional championships during her senior year PERIOD Summit also reached the state finals that season PERIOD Perry was named to the AllConference first team for four years PERIOD

Perry noticed the subtle but important differences immediately PERIOD

Soccer here is much more intense PERIOD The pace is faster Perry said PERIOD The talent level is different PERIOD At Summit we worked together and were close but there wasnt as much talent as people think PERIOD We worked well together PERIOD Here were just so deep PERIOD We have so much talent. champion knew what he was getting when he recruited and signed Perry PERIOD

I knew that she would score a lot in college Champion said PERIOD We brought her in as a goal scorer and a striker PERIOD She has a knack for getting shots off in tight spaces. for all her successes Perry almost never made it to SLU PERIOD

I had committed to Mizzou Perry said PERIOD But my roommate Tressa Pecher convinced me to come here PERIOD We played on the Busch team and she called me and got me to change me mind PERIOD It was the best decision that I ever made. champion knew that Perry could make an immediate impact PERIOD But even his expectations have been surpassed PERIOD

I knew that she would have a great chance to start but I figured that it would take a few weeks to break the starting lineup Champion said PERIOD But she came in during preseason and won her spot. but Perry has even surpassed her coachs expectations PERIOD

I thought that it would take her a lot longer to adjust to the level of play Champion said PERIOD Most young players have a problem adjusting to the physical play in college PERIOD I thought that it would take her a lot longer to adjust PERIOD But shes been a physical player from the beginning. perry has utilized her overall athleticism to frustrate her opposition in every contest PERIOD She is second in Conference USA in points scored with seven points PERIOD

Perry is tied for fifth in goals with three and leads the league in gamewinning goals PERIOD She also leads the league with three gamewinning goals PERIOD Perrys three gamewinners also lead the team PERIOD

The scary thing about Perry is that she hasnt reached her most productive point PERIOD

Jamie and Jenny Kehl are at a point where theyre starting to work well together said Champion PERIOD Jamie is getting better at being a target and holding people off the ball. hopefully we can get better at our quick passing Perry said PERIOD With Kehl back up top we can build on what we had earlier this year. even though shes a freshman Perry knows the ultimate point of the game PERIOD

We all work together Perry said PERIOD We play for each otherI play for you PERIOD You play for me. your donation will support the student journalists of Saint Louis University PERIOD Your contribution will help us cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
