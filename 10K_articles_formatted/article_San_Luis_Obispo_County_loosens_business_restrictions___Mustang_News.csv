While we celebrate this small success we must stay vigilant County Public Health Officer Dr PERIOD Penny Borenstein said in the news release PERIOD Our progress depends on each person in SLO County PERIOD We need everyone to do their part to slow the spread of COVID19 in our community. to stay in the red tier the county has to maintain the red tiers criteria for two consecutive weeks PERIOD The criteria includes having only four to seven daily new COVID19 cases per  people and a five to eight percent test positivity rate PERIOD

Without social distancing and wearing masks the county could potentially move back into the purple tier county spokesperson Michelle Shoresman said PERIOD

We are really teetering on that edge right now of being at or below the threshold to meet the red tier requirements Shoresman said PERIOD It wouldnt take much. to prevent the county from moving back to the purple tier Shoresman asked Cal Poly students to stay home and avoid large gatherings with people outside of their households PERIOD
