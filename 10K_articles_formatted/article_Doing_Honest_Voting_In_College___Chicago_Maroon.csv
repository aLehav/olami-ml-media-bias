2245,2022-03-16,"whether youve been on campus for three weeks or three years one thing is clear UChicago students have a lot of opinions many of which are political PERIOD And of course as is befitting of a college so committed to free speech we are not afraid to make our opinions heard perhaps demonstrated best by our prominent protests you may have seen the GSU walkout this past week PERIOD Together being opinionated and generally aware of the current political climate form a massive part of our campus culture clearly visible and audible in everything from class discussions to parties PERIOD

Why then does our voter turnout not reflect our opinionatedness The National Study of Learning Voting and Engagement NSLVE found that a mere  percent of UChicago students voted in the  midterm elections a dismal . percent of the  percent who were registered which was below the also poor national average of . percent PERIOD This was a year that saw a sweeping  gain in senate seats for the Republican party a disparity that still persists and fuels many of the currentday issues we care so much about PERIOD UChicagos voting rate was up to . percent for the contentious  presidential election according to the NSLVE but this was still only . percent of the . percent of UChicago students who were registered to vote and far lower than the national turnout rate of . percent PERIOD

As reflected in NSLVE statistics that . percent voting rate in  was just under two points higher than the NSLVE student voting average . percent but our registration rate of . percent was actually lower than the NSLVE student registration average . percent by just over two points PERIOD We members of an institution that prides itself on its focus on political discourse were truly average at the polls PERIOD Likewise the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge which promotes higher collegiate voting turnout gives usand many other schoolsa bronze rating in terms of student voter engagement PERIOD Other schools did better including Northwestern which earned a silver rating other schools did worse like Stanford with no rating PERIOD So that was UChicago in  decidedly average in terms of voter registration and turnout and part of a large pack tied for bronze a pack that includes many of our Ivy Leagueranking rivals such as Harvard Yale and Brown PERIOD

But thats not us Were UChicago goddammitas they told us all at our prospie overnights in that speech at Rockefeller we are decidedly not average and everyone knows that the only place we tie for third in is in the U.S PERIOD News  World Report rankings PERIOD

So why dont we care I trust that the people who care enough to protest are voting along with a handful of other students who dutifully register and cast their ballots PERIOD But for the restthe casual complainers who love to speak but loathe to actwhat more has to happen before its finally time to give a damn

We cant settle for average especially not now PERIOD Voter participation suffers a major slump during midterms but we can do better PERIOD Its so incredibly easy to retreat into your own bubble of work and stressinduced apathy to forget the issues that plague the rest of the country on a campus woefully bereft of cable TV PERIOD But we cannot fall victim to that to the ease of just not acting just relaxing and worshipping political theory over dare I even say practice PERIOD Voter apathy particularly on college campuses poses a dangerous trend especially when the group with the largest turnout continues to be made up of baby boomers who prove time and time again that they do not have our best interests in mind PERIOD

They like to call our generation lazy we need to prove more than ever that we are notthat we can do more than just complain PERIOD I cant count how many times on campus Ive heard people say that they dont see the point in voting that in the end their ballot doesnt matter sure maybe it doesnt make a difference if only you dont vote but based on how many times Ive heard that sentiment its a fairly common opinion PERIOD Those individual instances of apathy add up to a massive deficit in wouldbe voters and that is exactly how elections are lost PERIOD According to vote.org it takes two minutes to register to vote and another two minutes to request an absentee ballot PERIOD Many states are still allowing voter registration and even more are still mailing out absentees PERIOD The Institute of Politics here on campus is also providing free stamps and envelopes to mail in ballots and absentee request forms for states that require written appeals PERIOD Is it too much to ask for you to take a total of four minutes out of your stress napcryscream in order to register and order an absentee ballot and then go through the lists and mark down what you care about This is your chance to finally make your opinions have a quantitative value PERIOD It would be a shame to throw that opportunity away PERIOD

Vote goddammit PERIOD
