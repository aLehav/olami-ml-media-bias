Last week after living in this country for sixteen years I submitted my application to become a naturalized citizen of the United States PERIOD As I sealed the envelope I reflected on the promise of this nation so eloquently articulated by the common men and women who founded it I reflected on the action of its ordinary citizen who has consistently striven to fulfill its pledge I reflected on our leaders who regardless of political ideology can agree in one thing Make America Great PERIOD

Yasser Navarette Sophomore

It takes a lot more effort to follow a presidents political actions during a four year term in office than to just research their standpoints for a day in NovemberThe democratic process will be fully realized when people realize that their vote stands for something PERIOD And that something is the intent to hold their candidate if elected accountable to promises made during their campaigns PERIOD

Margaret Scott Freshman

If there was one thing this last election taught us it was that an extremely small number of votes can throw the election one way or another PERIOD From the looks of the polls this coming election is going to be one of the closest in history PERIOD No matter what people may think they need to realize that every single vote counts and can make a difference PERIOD It is absolutely imperative that all Americans implement their right to vote PERIOD This November I know my voice will be heard and I will play a role in selecting the next president of the United States PERIOD
