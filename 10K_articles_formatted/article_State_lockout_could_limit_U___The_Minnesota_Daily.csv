5035,2023-11-04,"some state contracts could expire along with the states twoyear budget PERIOD

by  Than TibbettsPublished  June  

University researchers learned this week that ongoing research projects could be stopped and hundreds of grants withheld if state lawmakers are unable to reach a budget deal by Thursday night PERIOD

Although University officials said they dont know what would be shut down as a result of the budget impasse some state contracts and grants could expire along with the states twoyear budget PERIOD

We think there are more than  of these grants and contracts said Ed Wink University associate vice president for Sponsored Projects Administration PERIOD

Richard Pfutzenreuter the Universitys chief financial officer said the good news for the University is that the highereducation bill was passed and the University will receive its budgeted money for the next two years PERIOD

Yet several budget bills remain undetermined as the deadline approaches which could leave some University researchers without funding come July  PERIOD

Wink said the grants and contracts represent approximately  million of research or publicservice projects annually PERIOD He said researchers at the University began receiving notices from state agencies earlier this week PERIOD

Wink added that state shutdown details are still hard to come by and many researchers arent sure whether their projects will be paused PERIOD

Lee Munnich a senior fellow in the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs said two of his projects received notice from the Minnesota Department of Transportation PERIOD

It could affect some of the faculty he said PERIOD We may shift some people to other projects if there is a suspension or a shutdown. munnichs projects are a study of the Interstate  toll lane and transportation policy research PERIOD The projects are worth approximately . million combined over the length of their contracts PERIOD

Sarah Youngerman Academic Health Center public relations associate director said the center would be affected because the state has yet to pass the health and human services bill PERIOD

Theres still a lot of confusion about what the impact would be Youngerman said PERIOD We would be looking at delays in research info and wasting research time. beth Nunnally the centers chief financial officer said the center has been instructed to continue to offer services through its clinics even though a shutdown would delay payments PERIOD

It doesnt mean we wouldnt get the dollars but it would be a longer wait she said PERIOD

Clinics designated as critical such as the CommunityUniversity Health Care Center in South Minneapolis will continue to receive payments on time Nunnally said PERIOD
