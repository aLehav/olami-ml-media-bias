CHICAGO AP  In a stunning ruling that could revolutionize a college sports industry worth billions of dollars and have dramatic repercussions at schools coast to coast a federal agency said Wednesday that football players at Northwestern University can create the nations first union of college athletes PERIOD

The decision by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board answered the question at the heart of the debate over the unionization bid Are football players who receive full scholarships to the Big Ten school considered employees under federal law thereby allowing them to unionize

Peter Sung Ohr the NLRB regional director said in a 24page decision that the players fall squarely within the broad definition of employee PERIOD

Prounion activists cheered as they learned of the ruling PERIOD

Its like preparing so long for a big game and then when you win  it is pure joy said former UCLA linebacker Ramogi Huma the designated president of Northwesterns wouldbe football players union PERIOD

The ruling addresses a unique situation in American college sports where the tradition of college competition has created a system that generates billions but relies on players who are not paid PERIOD In other countries elite youth athletes turn pro as teens but college sports are smalltime club affairs PERIOD

Under U.S PERIOD law an employee is regarded as someone who among other things receives compensation for a service and is under the strict direct control of managers PERIOD In the case of the Northwestern players coaches are the managers and scholarships are a form of compensation Ohr concluded PERIOD

The Evanston Ill. university argued that college athletes as students do not fit in the same category as factory workers truck drivers and other unionized workers PERIOD The school announced plans to appeal to labor authorities in Washington D.C PERIOD

Supporters of the union bid argued that the university ultimately treats football as more important than academics for scholarship players PERIOD Ohr sided with the players PERIOD

The record makes clear that the employers scholarship players are identified and recruited in the first instance because of their football prowess and not because of their academic achievement in high school Ohr wrote PERIOD He also noted that among the evidence presented by Northwestern no examples were provided of scholarship players being permitted to miss entire practices andor games to attend their studies. the ruling described how the life of a Northwestern football player is far more regimented than that of a typical student down to requirements about what they can eat and whether they can live off campus or purchase a car PERIOD At times players put  or  hours a week into football Ohr added PERIOD

Alan Cubbage Northwesterns vice president for university relations said in a statement that while the school respects the NLRB process and the regional directors opinion we disagree with it. huma said scholarship players would vote within  days on whether to formally authorize the College Athletes Players Association or CAPA to represent them PERIOD

The specific goals of CAPA include guaranteeing coverage of sportsrelated medical expenses for current and former players reducing head injuries and potentially letting players pursue commercial sponsorships PERIOD

Critics have argued that giving college athletes employee status and allowing them to unionize could hurt college sports in numerous ways including raising the prospect of strikes by disgruntled players or lockouts by athletic departments PERIOD

For now the push is to unionize athletes at private schools such as Northwestern because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities PERIOD But Huma said Wednesdays decision is the first domino to fall and that teams at schools  both public and private  could eventually follow the Wildcats lead PERIOD

Outgoing Wildcats quarterback Kain Colter took a leading role in establishing CAPA PERIOD The United Steelworkers union has been footing the legal bills PERIOD

Colter who has entered the NFL draft said nearly all of the  scholarship players on the Wildcats roster backed the union bid though only he expressed his support publicly PERIOD

He said the No PERIOD  reason to unionize was to ensure injured players have their medical needs met PERIOD

With the sacrifices we make athletically medically and with our bodies we need to be taken care of Colter told ESPN PERIOD

The NCAA has been under increasing scrutiny over its amateurism rules and is fighting a classaction federal lawsuit by former players seeking a cut of the billions of dollars earned from live broadcasts memorabilia sales and video games PERIOD Other lawsuits allege the NCAA failed to protect players from debilitating head injuries PERIOD

NCAA President Mark Emmert has pushed for a 2000perplayer stipend to help athletes defray some expenses PERIOD Critics say that is not nearly enough considering players help bring in millions of dollars to their schools and conferences PERIOD

In a written statement the NCAA said it disagreed with the notion that studentathletes are employees PERIOD

We frequently hear from studentathletes across all sports that they participate to enhance their overall college experience and for the love of their sport not to be paid the NCAA said PERIOD

All of the big NCAA conferences including the SEC also disagreed with the decision PERIOD

Notwithstanding todays decision the SEC does not believe that full time students participating in intercollegiate athletics are employees of the universities they attend Michael Slive the SEC commissioner said in a written statement PERIOD

The developments are coming to a head when major college programs are awash in cash generated by new television deals that include separate networks for the big conferences PERIOD The NCAA tournament generates an average of  million a year in television rights itself much of which is distributed to member schools PERIOD

Attorneys for CAPA argued that college football is for all practical purposes a commercial enterprise that relies on players labor to generate billions of dollars in profits PERIOD The NLRB ruling noted that from  to  the Northwestern program generated  million in revenue  profits the university says went to subsidize other sports PERIOD

During the NLRBs five days of hearings in February Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald took the stand for union opponents and his testimony sometimes was at odds with Colters PERIOD

Colter told the hearing that players performance on the field was more important to Northwestern than their inclass performance saying You fulfill the football requirement and if you can you fit in academics. asked why Northwestern gave him a scholarship of  a year he responded To play football PERIOD To perform an athletic service. but Fitzgerald said he tells players academics come first saying We want them to be the best they can be .. PERIOD to be a champion in life. college athletes might start getting paid PERIOD Or not PERIOD Theyre definitely going to be represented by a union though PERIOD
