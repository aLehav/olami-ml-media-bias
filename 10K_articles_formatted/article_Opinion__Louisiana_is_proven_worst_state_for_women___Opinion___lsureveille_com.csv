The Center for American Progress told the world something Louisiana women already knew when it empirically proved the Bayou State to be the worst for women last Wednesday PERIOD

By the numbers were fiftieth of all  states based on the economics of female jobs the number of women in leadership positions and womens health provisions PERIOD

We should be ashamed PERIOD Theres a mother pelican with all her little babies on our flag PERIOD That should merit some sort of concrete esteem for the women in this state PERIOD

Maryland is the best state in these same categories and their flag doesnt even make sense PERIOD Its an English heraldic banner and honestly that shouldve died after the Revolutionary War PERIOD

So weve been beat out by some Britishloving sliver of a Northeastern state PERIOD

I guess this data is the final sign that women in the South should give up on their progressive expectations PERIOD The stretch of states from Georgia to Texas on the American Progress map is solid red meaning each of those states is in the bottom  along with Utah South Dakota and Indiana PERIOD

Theres no escape unless you want to travel up North where people recommend Chilis as a good restaurant PERIOD

Thats one area in which the South excels PERIOD We do have the best cooking in the United States and thats probably because women are so oppressed everywhere else that we have nowhere to go but the kitchen PERIOD

I dont know about you but Id rather spend my days baking bread and making gumbo instead of advocating endlessly for a bunch of old men to consider me in their lawmaking PERIOD

I dont think Id get as much of a headache making food PERIOD

Heres the sad thing Im really bad at cooking so I guess Ill just have to go with continued attempts to get this state to listen PERIOD

Honestly I think college women live in a bubble of critical thinking and have the outlets to remain untouched by Louisiana generalities PERIOD

That and most of us dont have functional kitchens PERIOD

We do have a chance to be outraged though PERIOD As the future Southern businesspeople  and I do mean people not just women  we have the chance to make sure that next time this happens Louisiana doesnt top the charts as the worst state PERIOD

Maybe in  years well still be pretty bad PERIOD Progress moves slowly PERIOD We might even still be the worst PERIOD But any movement from here will be toward a more positive future PERIOD

At least I hope so PERIOD If we end up with less than  percent of our Congressional leaders being women we as a state will have failed PERIOD

As much as this is a human issue not just affecting women but the men in their lives as well those men in leadership roles dont seem to understand that what they do doesnt exactly follow their good intentions to treat their wives and mothers well PERIOD

Im pretty sure the  percent male contingent of Louisianians in Congress doesnt hold a weekly meeting about how best to marginalize females PERIOD Im not blaming them for doing something with rage in their hearts PERIOD

Im blaming them for not having a rage a passion for equality that could lead them to address our states wrongdoing PERIOD Im sure they have talking points that could argue circles around Louisiana not being the worst state PERIOD

Thats fine PERIOD They can keep their speeches while Louisiana women live out the truth of Congressional action PERIOD

We will bite back PERIOD Theres a generation of women biding their time in college watching our mothers battle through the workplace and our friends battle through medical red tape PERIOD

As soon as there are enough of us someone will listen PERIOD
