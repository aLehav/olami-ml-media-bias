Conservative legislators in some states want to abolish nofault divorce PERIOD Nofault divorce allows a couple to end their marriage without either party committing an offense such as adultery or domestic violence PERIOD Simply falling out of love and unhappiness are enough reason for a nofault divorce PERIOD

A Washington Post article describes legislation threatening nofault divorce in Oklahoma Iowa and New Hampshire PERIOD It states In Oklahoma lawmakers are also considering a bill that would virtually prohibit nofault divorce but preserve divorce as an option in cases of impotency. current law in Virginia states that a nofault divorce can be awarded if the husband and wife have been living apart and independent of one another for atleastone year according to the Virginia State Bar PERIOD In certain cases a nofault divorce will be granted in six months PERIOD
