College is a stressful time for everyone PERIOD In addition to stress living the college lifestyle gets notably expensive at times PERIOD Many students try to get a job which often comes with terrible hours and lousy pay PERIOD Starting your own business is one way to make some extra cash to put in your pocket PERIOD One student here at Georgia College has done just that and has taken her business to another level PERIOD

Hannah Warren is a secondyear student with a passion for fashion PERIOD She runs her business Limitless Looks through platforms like Instagram and Depop PERIOD On these apps she sells womens clothing as well as jewelry PERIOD Hannah makes rings and necklace medallions with beautiful designs PERIOD

She works out of her college apartment from where she takes photos of her products edits and posts them online for customers to see and potentially purchase PERIOD Hannah also buys blank strips of metal and metal stamps a bender and a sharpie that she uses to make customordered rings PERIOD This is only one aspect of her business PERIOD

She also finds stylish retail items that she posts on her social media platforms for sale PERIOD Once a customer pays for an item Hannah packages and ships the item often including a free business card and sticker to keep her customers coming back PERIOD She says Whenever I am working on my business it feels like time is flying by PERIOD It doesnt really feel like work. hannah started this business because fashion is something she loves PERIOD Driven by this passion she set goals to start and run a successful and profitable business PERIOD Her belief anyone can run a business PERIOD She says all it takes is finding something that you are passionate about and dedicating your time PERIOD

When someone finds their passion they found something that they love and there is a great chance that someone else loves that too. emma Sinderstine a regular customer of Limitless Looks appreciates this business because it is unique in that it doesnt just offer one thing PERIOD It is also a small business that primarily functions out of a small area of town. emma says Hannah recognizes that most college students do not have much money and establishes her pricing accordingly PERIOD

Another customer Mary Kate Kotzin notes This business is unique because there are always highquality products for a good price. based on her experience thus far Hannah has advice for other students who may have dreamed of starting a business PERIOD You should not be afraid to start your own business and dont be afraid of other peoples opinions PERIOD Keep trying. hannah said In the beginning I was very discouraged and I was not selling a lot PERIOD Now I have ring orders for sororities and have sold over  clothes and rings PERIOD And you can do it too. according to Hannah this was a leap of faith a leap that countless others have taken PERIOD She hopes her success will be an example to others trying to start a business PERIOD
