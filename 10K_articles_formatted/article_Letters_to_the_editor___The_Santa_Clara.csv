To the Editor

I would like to take this chance to respond to the pleasant and oh whats the word completely delusional letter to the editor concerning the alcohol policy in the Oct PERIOD  issue PERIOD The authors reasons for not accepting a medical amnesty are perhaps the flimsiest arguments I have ever heard PERIOD

First it states that if there was a medical amnesty program people would call the EMTs just so they wouldnt get written up PERIOD Im sure that the program does not include a clause that says that anyone who has contact with the EMTs cannot be written up PERIOD

Students already in the process of getting written up would not be able to call the EMTs and be exempt from a writeup PERIOD The purpose of the plan is that people would call the EMTs if their friend was in danger of alcohol poisoning PERIOD Yes amnesty would likely result in more calls to the EMTs and yes some of them would be unnecessary but the point of the amnesty is better safe than sorry PERIOD

In the article Dan Stepan head EMT stated that he would rather have someone play it safe than try to make that crucial judgment call on their own PERIOD

As for  I would say its right there Stepan sighted  cases of offduty calls to EMTs PERIOD Thats  people that should have called the EMTs but didnt PERIOD

I can tell you something of my own personal experience people drink the exact same as they did before PERIOD The new alcohol policy has just driven drinking more underground or off campus PERIOD But most importantly it has made calling EMTs an even more difficult decision PERIOD

Someones life should never be a difficult decision PERIOD I applaud EMTs Dan Stepan and Nick Pontrelli on finally stepping up and doing something for the safety of students and I implore the school to take action PERIOD

Alcoholism is a disease prohibition not answer

To the Editor

In response to the authors article titled  I would like to refute many of her statements PERIOD She seems to imply that alcohol use is something new that instead of being made almost  years ago in China out of rice and honey it is something only recently discovered PERIOD The effects of alcohol are widely known and widely documented excessive alcohol like many things can be detrimental to your health PERIOD

First of all alcoholism is a disease something not to be bunched in with the runofthemill caffeine addict who instead of sleeping enough on a regular basis has become physically addicted to a stimulant PERIOD Second not everyone who drinks becomes an alcoholic PERIOD In fact the great majority of individuals do not become alcoholics PERIOD

The second point in the article is the recommendation that the government should control morality PERIOD Now without exposing my own morals for all to see how exactly would government enact 

How is morality defined Is the implication simply that drinking is immoral

My point is simply this If you make the government the morality police where is the line drawn Even more basic than that how do you define morality

Here is one point where our opinions overlap  drunk driving is bad Luckily this has been well documented and is well regulated PERIOD

The simple truth is drinking responsibly has been a human right for the last  years PERIOD It only becomes an issue when it is abused PERIOD

Prohibition was a failure and would be a failure if enacted today PERIOD The 1920s and 30s gave birth to some of the most notorious organized crime figures in U.S PERIOD history PERIOD

When I open up my first beer tonight Ill toast to the great freedom that our society entrusts us with PERIOD When I get ready to sleep Ill offer a word of thanks for the great responsibility we are entrusted with PERIOD

To the Editor

What the author of the prohibition article in last weeks issue forgets is that not all of us have  You can never understand what some people have been through what they continue to go through PERIOD

Ill take an artificial high over a natural low any day PERIOD Something else the author forgets is that alcohol prohibition was what gave us Al Capone and the St PERIOD Valentines Day Massacre PERIOD Weve tried prohibition PERIOD Now its time to admit there might be another way PERIOD

Our police shouldnt arrest people because of their potential for crime PERIOD Its well past time to give drug users a chance to use their intoxicants of choice responsibly so we can empower citizens with these millions of dollars instead of criminals and gangsters PERIOD

DARE without analysis

To the Editor

There is a very good reason for allowing only adults to vote PERIOD Children are not able to understand the nuances which convert many black and white situations into various shades of gray PERIOD

Read the naive article from the Oct PERIOD  opinion section on prohibition wherein she calls for a return to alcohol prohibition PERIOD Her reasoning for this position comes straight out of a DARE class she took in grade seven Drugs are bad mkay Alcohol is a drug PERIOD Therefore alcohol is bad and will keep you from reaching your full potential mkay

She then applies her DAREinspired critical thinking skills and derives 

She fails to see what is happening all around her with illegal drugs she fails to heed the lessons of history regarding alcohol prohibition and she fails to use critical thinking skills to evaluate her position and the lessons she was taught in DARE PERIOD When she develops those skills she will be all grown up and ready to vote PERIOD Until then she is a work in progress though progress is obviously painfully slow PERIOD
