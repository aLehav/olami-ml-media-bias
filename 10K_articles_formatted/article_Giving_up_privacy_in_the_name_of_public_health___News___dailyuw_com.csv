Updated November     pm



In January when there were only a handful of COVID19 cases in the United States the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention CDC and other governmental websites published information on people who were infected without revealing their names PERIOD

The first travelrelated case was a 35yearold man from Snohomish County who landed in the SeattleTacoma International Airport after traveling from Wuhan China PERIOD Not long after new cases of patients living in the Life Care Center of Kirkland Washington were published revealing their age location and underlying health conditions PERIOD

While most of the public doesnt personally know the infected cases the amount of information revealed in the media could be enough for some people such as acquaintances classmates and coworkers to figure which of their friends or family members have the coronavirus PERIOD

Now that the total number of cases in the United States reaches over  the media and state officials are less likely to disclose infected cases individually PERIOD A person who is tested positive for the coronavirus becomes another digit in a database and not necessarily publicized on the news PERIOD

Clearly the burden lies among the early coronavirus patients whose personal information was made public in the name of public health PERIOD Informatics professor Megan Finn said that people could be stigmatized if unnecessary information about them was misinterpreted by the public PERIOD

In South Korea people are receiving text messages from the government informing who is infected where theyve been and when PERIOD BBC reported that while the texts dont disclose peoples names and addresses others still manage to connect the dots and attack those infected on social media PERIOD

Finn also added that Asians in Western countries such as the United States the United Kingdom and Australia are facing racist attacks because of the coronaviruss origin from China PERIOD

Similarly Muslim Americans were also violently targeted after  leading to the Patriot Act that allowed the government to use surveillance on people PERIOD

We have to be mindful in these moments of crisis and disaster what were willing to give up in the name of fighting some of these things Finn said PERIOD

In recent news Google and Apple teamed up to build a Bluetoothenabled feature that sends alerts to users who might be in close contact with an infected person PERIOD But associate professor of law Ryan Calo argues that having the ability to follow every citizen with their phone is not the power that he wants the government to have beyond the pandemic PERIOD

One of the concerns that I have is that the power given to the government will continue after the pandemic and that people will get acclimated to the new normal where government surveillance is commonplace Calo said PERIOD

He also added that voluntary selfreporting apps could lead to inaccurate data about health and location PERIOD For example if a user is living in a neighborhood with a lot of cases but not a lot of people using the app the user is falsely reassured PERIOD

Similarly if people are selfreporting that they have the coronavirus but they havent had that verified theres the danger that people will panic even though they dont need to Calo said PERIOD

Big data and algorithms are powerful in controlling information in the pandemic PERIOD While government tech companies and universities including the UW are developing contacttracing apps the tradeoff between protecting identity and controlling the pandemic is still a moral debate PERIOD

The public needs to be informed on the spread of new coronavirus cases but some argue that people who are infected shouldnt need to compromise their rights to privacy PERIOD
