Considerable cloudiness PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Welcome to the QA with TV critic  also known to some TV fans as their TV therapist  Matt Roush wholl try to address whatever you love loathe are confused or frustrated or thrilled by in todays vast TV landscape PERIOD We know background music is too loud but theres always closedcaptioning. one caution This is a spoilerfree zone so we wont be addressing upcoming storylines here unless its already common knowledge PERIOD Please send your questions and comments toaskmatttvinsider.comand follow me on TwitterTVGMMattRoush PERIOD Look for Ask

Question I actually really loved the new Frasier PERIOD What are you hearing about whether CBS will air more episodes I really dont want to pay for streaming and network TV could use some decent content right now PERIOD  Teri

Matt Roush For now I wouldnt count on it PERIOD The deal for rebooting Frasier was always made with an eye for the Paramount streaming platform PERIOD Thats why the episodes are longer not necessarily a good thing. the CBS stunt as weve seen done before on Paramounts cable network to promote the various Yellowstone spinoffs was really just a tease and an incentive to get viewers to subscribe to what companies like Paramount Global see as their future PERIOD That said youre absolutely right that CBSs poor excuse for a strikealtered fall season could use something like Frasier and my friend at Vulture the wise Joe Adalian made this very argument in one of his fine Buffering columns PERIOD Depending on how long the actors stay on strike and how long it takes to get fresh programming back on the air its possible CBS could pick up more of the first season though theres no talk of this that I am aware of PERIOD Paramount will almost certainly continue to have exclusive access to the firstrun episodes for the time being although the new Frasier would be an even more appropriate fit for broadcast TV PERIOD

Question Can you give us an update on our favorites The Handmaids Tale and Severance I cant find out anything PERIOD And dont you think Severance truly deserved the Emmy for Best Drama because of its brilliant originality and writing On another topic Apples Lessons in Chemistry is pretty close to Mad Men excellence PERIOD If this screws Severance out of another Emmy I wont be so upset PERIOD Unless Severance is even better in Season   IF there is a Season  PERIOD  John L PERIOD

Matt Roush New seasons of The Handmaids Tale and Severance were both sidelined by the strike PERIOD Production on Severances second season was paused by the strike and wont resume until the actors go back to work PERIOD Handmaid was still in the writing stage for its sixth and final season when the writers strike brought everything to a halt PERIOD So well have to be patient to get these shows back sometime in  PERIOD

As for Severance at the Emmys it was always going to be a tough call between a show this innovative and one as brilliant and popular especially with Emmy voters as HBOs Succession which will almost certainly win again for its final season with Severance not back in the mix again until next year PERIOD Squid Game and Season  of Yellowjackets also generated great buzz in the  race so while I agree that Severance was deserving for its riveting first season I wasnt surprised to see it come up short PERIOD Regarding Lessons in Chemistry which I also love it will be competing in the limitedseries categories not drama series so Severance wont have to worry about that PERIOD

Question Why is there a notification before each episode of The Irrational saying it is not based on real events Last week I think the notification actually was shown both before and after the episode PERIOD I dont recall seeing it for the pilot but it has been there for each of the others PERIOD Any idea why None of the other NBC scripted dramas I watch feel compelled to remind me that I am watching fiction is there something special about this one that has the lawyers worried  Tenille

Matt Roush These advisories are best known for appearing before episodes of the various Law  Order series and Ive always assumed thats because of the ripped from the headlines nature of the storytelling which takes inspiration from notorious cases while putting their own fictional spin on it using the notification to give them legal protection PERIOD I was also startled to see these notices so prominently displayed on The Irrational which doesnt feel nearly as realitybased with the possible exception of the episode about the downed airliner PERIOD Still in our litigious times with such fascination in truecrime TV it may be in any fictional shows best interest to err on the side of abundant caution PERIOD

Question Im always late to the party PERIOD Upon my sons recommendations I bingewatched all of What We Do in the Shadows and am currently watching Season  of Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia PERIOD I enjoy both and find myself laughing aloud during each episode PERIOD My question concerns Sunny PERIOD Is there a meaning to the title and do the creators base the characters on people they know or are the creators comic geniuses who invented outrageous characters and storylines  Adrienne Winter Garden FL

Matt Roush Ive read that the shows original title while in development Its Always Sunny on TV may have been inspired by the aha song The Sun Always Shines on TV but cocreator Rob McElhenney once joked on Jimmy Kimmel Live that they simply couldnt think of a better name PERIOD My take on the title has always been that its meant to be ironic much like the peppy theme music when you consider the miserable lives of these badluck boobs living under a dark cloud of their own misanthropic making PERIOD The shows genesis is a bit more complicated having grown out of lowbudget home movies the guys made when they were all looking for work so I guess you could say it was all inspired by their friendship taken to an absurdist level PERIOD

Question Do you know when we can expect to see the third season of HBOs Industry Im pretty sure I read their production was not affected by the strikes so hoping well see a premiere soon PERIOD  Matt G PERIOD

Matt Roush Youre right that production reportedly was not affected by the strikes and while HBO hasnt announced anything yet its probably safe to say we wont see the new episodes until  though how early in the year we dont yet know PERIOD It feels like the premium networks are parceling out their shows a bit more carefully because even when cameras begin rolling again there wont be as much in the pipeline for a while PERIOD So it might make sense to hold a show like this back so there will be something new to air until things back to normal PERIOD

Comment The writers strike has ended but before TooMuchTV comes roaring back I recommend you take advantage of this relative lull and watch the blackly comic crime mystery Deadloch on Prime Video PERIOD Only one season so far and seriously it checks SOOOOO many of your boxes PERIOD Come for the Tasmanian landscapes stay for everything else PERIOD  Ryan

Matt Roush I appreciate the recommendation especially for shows from other lands which the streamers tend to premiere with minimal fanfare and without promoting the way they do their homegrown product PERIOD I dont believe I got a single headsup about this shows premiere in June. im also rather touched and amused to imagine that people think that even in these strikeimpacted months Im running out of new things to watch PERIOD Just keeping up with the regular weekly output of shows I follow plus trying to consume full seasons of new and returning programming as they arrive fewer than before but still not an inconsiderable amount leaves me precious little time for this kind of discovery PERIOD I will however add it to my list with thanks and am happy to share the tip with others PERIOD

Thats all for now PERIOD We cant do this without your participation so please keep sending questions and comments about TV toaskmatttvinsider.comor shoot me a line on Twitter TVGMMattRoush PERIOD Please include a first name with your question. more Headlines
