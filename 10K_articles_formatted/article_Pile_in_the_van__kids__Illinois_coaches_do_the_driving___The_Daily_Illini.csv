Theres more to coaching at the college level than working with studentathletes PERIOD Some coaches have to become students themselves PERIOD

Some head and assistant coaches for smaller collegiate teams are required to take a class on driving a 15passenger van PERIOD They learn about the safety buckles and turning but as Illinois womens head tennis coach Evan Clark said its not rocket science. after passing the course the coaches are allowed to drive their respective teams to tournaments PERIOD

The mens and womens tennis track and field golf and crosscountry teams all use vans because they dont have enough members to fill a bus PERIOD Its also cheaper though head womens golf coach Renee Slone said she did not know how much the vans save PERIOD

I dont know if fun would be the right word to describe driving the teams Slone said PERIOD I certainly dont mind it. from the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

The teams ride in a turtle top van that includes WiFi TVs and DVD players PERIOD They also have luggage racks and high ceilings to allow passengers to stand up PERIOD

The coaches look at their teams schedule and drive to tournaments that are inefficient to fly to PERIOD The coaches factor in flight delays and travel expenses to their calculations PERIOD

Clark said that if a match is more than five hours away his team will fly PERIOD Other teams including Ohio State and Nebraskas mens tennis teams have a sixhour limit PERIOD

Team travel for smaller teams like tennis depends on the schools budgets but most teams travel the same way Carrie Smith the director of operations for the Ohio State tennis teams said PERIOD It is very common for schools to travel by minivans  12passenger vans  to other schools for away matches that are up to six hours away PERIOD Ohio State is no exception. despite some coaches time limits the Illinois womens golf team drove  hours and  minutes to Minneapolis in September for the Minnesota Invitational PERIOD

Slones team stopped in Elgin Illinois at teammate Stephanie Millers house PERIOD A week later the Illini rode in their van for  hours and  minutes to Knoxville Tennessee for the MercedesBenz Collegiate PERIOD

Slone has experience with long road trips She used to drive herself to amateur and professional golf competitions PERIOD She once drove  hours straight from Phoenix to Peoria Illinois PERIOD

Clark said his team takes a charter bus to Minnesota because the trip includes several days of matches and traveling PERIOD

Players spend those hours in the van sleeping doing homework watching game film or strategizing PERIOD The coaches who will alternate between driving may meet with players individually strategize or scout PERIOD

Coaches keep any receipts after using a University credit card for food and gas PERIOD It takes money out of the teams budgets but they are later reimbursed PERIOD

The only time driving long distances gets a little bit tougher is when we finish a match and youre driving late said Clark who prefers to drink coffee during the longer rides PERIOD Thats the only time it gets really really challenging  It could be snowing or raining or something like that. these driving conditions do raise some safety concerns PERIOD

Safe transportation of studentathletes may be an oftneglected riskmanagement issue facing college athletics administrators Dr PERIOD David Lavetter a professor of sports management at Arkansas University concluded in his  case study of coaches driving vans PERIOD Even when an event is properly organized and managed an accident can immediately turn the trip into a disaster PERIOD Sadly too many NCAA institutions have been involved in teamrelated van accidents. in  the coach and two players of the TennesseeMartin baseball team were critically injured after its coach Vicotor Cates pulled out in front of an oncoming truck at the intersection of two highways and stopped for an unknown reason PERIOD

Lavetter recommends ridding schools of 15passenger vans and from having their coaches driving any vehicles PERIOD He also recommends not traveling between midnight and  a.m PERIOD

They keep talking about not letting the coaches drive vans Clark said PERIOD For the most part if we dont feel like we should be driving we make other arrangements. emailprotected
