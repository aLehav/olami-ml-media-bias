Meet the District  supervisor candidate Amy Reichert

As San Diego State students are reaching the end of their first semester amidst a pandemic many have decided to take next semester off PERIOD

 students took a leave of absence during the spring  semester compared to about  students for the spring  semester according to SDSU Associate Vice President of Enrollment Management Stefan Hyman PERIOD

The amount of students taking a leave of absence for the spring  semester is expected to grow PERIOD This is consistent with past semesters according to Hyman PERIOD

With the recent University Senate decision to replace Spring Break this year with four separate rest and recovery days many college students are concerned about the mental health issues and financial obstacles that come with continuing their college careers solely online PERIOD

I think its important to understand that if you are not learning the best over the online format and maybe you dont quite know what you want to do in terms of what your major is or what your career is or if youre going through a hard time right now I would consider taking a leave of absence if you can firstyear English graduate student Weston Robertson said PERIOD

Robertson decided to take next semester off and return in the fall because he feels like both his mental and physical health is drained after this semester PERIOD

Youre having so much screen time it drains you Robertson said PERIOD Its a lot of mental work. some international students graduate students and undergraduate students have decided to take next semester off because of screen time burnout wanting more relevant experiencea better educational opportunity and to save money PERIOD

International secondyear student Ornella Rossi decided to take next semester off because a big part of her going to college in the U.S PERIOD was to interact with students here and practice speaking English PERIOD

I decided to study in the U.S PERIOD not only for the education but for the experience of living in the U.S. so meeting new people and talking in English most of my days and the fact that I would only have online classes I feel like Id be wasting my potential of studying in the U.S. Rossi said. i feel like its not worth it spending all that money when Im going to be studying in my room not meeting new people not meeting my professors. rossi along with other students living on campus was only given a 24hour notice to move out of the dorms back in March when SDSU first moved all classes online due to the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD

For international students like Rossi who is from San Paulo Brazil moving back included many international fees expensive flights getting storage and more PERIOD Rossi also said that the U.S PERIOD dollar is worth five Brazilian dollars so its considerably more expensive to study internationally PERIOD

International students and outofstate students pay a fee per every credit and we had to pay the whole tuition in full and we werent even having the same experience Rossi said PERIOD We were having online classes and I honestly believe you dont learn as much. for students like biochemistry thirdyear Jeannette Espinoza the decision to take the semester off also came from wanting a more relevant educational experience PERIOD

As an alternative to online classes next semester Espinoza is currently applying to coop or extended internships within her major which are paid and are fulltime PERIOD

Especially as a biochemistry student I want to be in the lab Espinoza said PERIOD  I want to be able to compete with everybody else who is receiving a degree or their masters PERIOD Coops give that handson experience and will help me financially. espinoza is an independent and had to take out loans to attend college PERIOD She usually works to help support herself while attending school but the job market is even more difficult due to the pandemic PERIOD

Other students like interdisciplinary studies fourthyear Zoe Jones felt like there was a lack of support and communication from SDSU and her professors PERIOD

Its hard enough having to deal with everything but having to basically teach yourself Jones said PERIOD It was all selfled to me and there didnt seem to be an open line of communication between students and professors  not in most of my classes at least. in order to take a leave of absence a student must be in good academic standing not have any fees due or holds and be previously enrolled in at least one semester Hyman said PERIOD

Students can take a leave of absence for a maximum of four semesters either consecutively or spread out PERIOD

To take a leave of absence theres a brief form to be completed including the reason for the absence PERIOD Then those request forms go to the registrar office for approval which can take a couple of weeks Hyman said PERIOD",Students plan to take semester off after first full semester of online learning â€“ The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
