As Michigan competes with Ohio State to draw the most blood from
its students the organizers of the annual Blood Battle hope to
avoid a pattern they call the curse. every year for the past  years that Michigan has won the Blood
Battle it has lost the football game against its biggest rival PERIOD
Blood Battle cochair and LSA junior Jodi Keller hopes this year
that the curse will be broken and Michigan will win both on and off
the field PERIOD

The blood drive kicks off today and will take place across
campus until Nov PERIOD  the day before the football game in the Big
House PERIOD This years Blood Battle marks the twenty-second year the
schools have competed to collect the most blood PERIOD

Michigan officially starts collecting today  a late start
compared to the Buckeyes who already began the battle two weeks
ago PERIOD Even with its late start University students expect to win
said Keller who runs the event with LSA seniors Kate Wooley and
Kat Lesko PERIOD

Im pretty confident about winning she
said PERIOD Weve won a lot more than weve lost in
the past. following tradition the results of the Blood Battle will be
announced at halftime with a trophy awarded to the school that
donates the most blood PERIOD

As the MichiganOhio State competition is the largest blood
drive in the nation turnout numbers are expected to be high PERIOD An
estimated  to  pints of blood are expected this year
said Keller PERIOD

The American Red Cross often finds difficulty in meeting
hospitals need for blood PERIOD According to the groups
website every two seconds of each day someone needs blood in the
United States PERIOD More than  blood donations are needed daily PERIOD A
single car accident victim alone can require as many as  units
of blood PERIOD Also the demand for blood transfusions is growing faster
than donations PERIOD

The supply is low Keller adds PERIOD If there
were a national tragedy there wouldnt be enough blood PERIOD
Thats why its important to donate and a good time is
now. although he cannot donate blood Engineering junior Andrew Bush
said the cause is an important one PERIOD I think the Blood
Battle is a great idea and plan on watching the game and the
results on TV he added PERIOD
