The women in Foster Hall branched out and petitioned the administration to open roommate choice PERIOD Administrators allowed residents to room with students of different ethnicities by request only said Sims a  graduate PERIOD

Sims lived in Foster two years when the curfew was  p.m PERIOD Sunday through Thursday PERIOD Instead of resident assistants students had dorm mothers who were older women who gave demerits when a resident came in past curfew and violated rules PERIOD

The discussion was held Sunday in Foster with seven alumni PERIOD Hollis R PERIOD Henley a junior English major said the mixer shows alumni are concerned about the wellbeing of current black students PERIOD

It is very important that we know the history of blacks at TCU so that we can learn from it and appreciate what we have now and utilize our resources Henley said PERIOD
Sims didnt have any sororities to get involved in so she formed Students for the Advancement of African American Culture Organization a group for students to voice their opinions about student activities not inclusive to the black community PERIOD

We had to stick together because if we didnt there wouldnt had been a lot of us together to make a change Sims said PERIOD

Anthony Johnson a  graduate said fewer resources were available to him on campus than there are now PERIOD

What resources we had we milked it dry Johnson said PERIOD

Henley said the difference between black alumni and black students now is that alumni united because there was a lack of concern for blacks PERIOD The alumni filled that void with the Black Student Caucus Programming Council and other recreational events that promoted a sense of community for black students Henley said PERIOD

Now that they have opened those doors it seems to me that we are less passionate than they were about establishing and maintaining that sense of community Henley said PERIOD",Alumni gather for history awareness | TCU 360,Texas Christian University
