Linebacker David Long celebrates after sacking the Utah quarterback during the Zaxbys Heart of Dallas bowl in Dallas TX PERIOD

With spring football in the books West Virginia will turn its attention to summer workouts and fall camp PERIOD

The Mountaineers return multiple starters on all three sides of the ball but numerous newcomers and position battles have emerged in the winter in spring and will carry on throughout the summer and early part of fall PERIOD

Lets take a look at an early projection of who could be on the defensive side of the ball for West Virginia PERIOD

Defensive Ends Reese

Donahue and Ezekiel Rose

Nose Tackle Darius Stills

Coming into spring the defensive line looked to be one of the more solid position groups on the defensive side with all three starters from last season returning PERIOD However the group has taken a small step back with news of freshman Lamonte McDougle announcing his decision to transfer from the program PERIOD

This news seemed to come out of nowhere and leaves a hole at the nose tackle position since McDougle started nine games there last season on his way to earning ESPN Freshman AllAmerican honors but a couple of new faces have emerged PERIOD

McDougle sat out spring practices due to his recovery from shoulder surgery during the offseason but in his place Stills emerged as one of the top defensive players during the spring and received nothing but praise from defensive coordinator Tony Gibson for

his athleticism PERIOD

West Virginia also added USC transfer and former fivestar recruit Kenny Bigelow to the mix at nose tackle PERIOD

At defensive end the Mountaineers return last years starters in Donahue and Rose PERIOD Donahue bulked up and put on more weight during the offseason in an effort to build up the defensive front and focus more on stopping the run something the team struggled to do last season PERIOD

After a solid season last year Rose brings size strength and pure athleticism at the other defensive end position and has emerged as the position groups leader PERIOD

 Rose said PERIOD 

Linebackers

MIKE Dylan Tonkey

SAM Charlie Benton

WILL David Long

A series of position changes have taken place at linebacker with the departures of AlRasheed Benton and

Xavier Preston PERIOD

Tonkery has the move from outside linebacker to middle linebacker in place of Benton and he is another player who added some weight since the position change since hell be taking on more offensive lineman at middle linebacker PERIOD

Long another player who sat out this spring has been recovering from a meniscus injury and will return to outside linebacker at the WILL spot PERIOD He is a proven difference maker on the field racking up  total tackles and . sacks after missing the first four games of the season including an 18tackle game against Oklahoma State PERIOD

Depth is a concern at linebacker right now with Quondarius Qualls and Brendan Ferns both going down with ACL injuries during the spring but Benton a junior college transfer from Butler Community College in Kansas received more reps at SAM and looks to be the frontrunner at the position for now PERIOD

 Gibson said PERIOD 

Cornerbacks Hakeem Bailey and Derrek Pitts

The cornerback position is arguably the biggest question mark for West Virginia heading into summer and

fall camp PERIOD

Bailey who started three games last season has the most experience as of now playing the position and will likely be one of the starters PERIOD

 cornerbacks coach Doug Belk said PERIOD 

Pitts made the move from safety to cornerback during the offseason and has adjusted to the move PERIOD He saw playing time last season at safety and special teams and his ability to adapt and work hard may lead him to a starting role at cornerback PERIOD

 said safeties coach Matt Caponi PERIOD 

The Mountaineers have options with Michigan transfer Keith Washington and free safety Kenny Robinson who started three games at cornerback last season PERIOD But this battle will likely be decided at the end of fall camp PERIOD

Full Safety Kenny Robinson

SPUR Safety Dravon AskewHenry

Bandit Safety Toyous Avery

The Safety position looks to be in good hands with experience at all three roles PERIOD AskewHenry moved over to the SPUR safety spot during the offseason looks to be the favorite to win the job PERIOD The bandit spot also looks to be in good hands with Avery but the key for both players for this upcoming season will be to stay healthy PERIOD

Robinson looks like he may returning to play full safety full time but theres a strong chance he could play some more cornerback again if injuries occur PERIOD But if this occurs West Virginia has a solid backup option in Ohio State transfer Josh Norwood who gained a reputation for being an aggressive player that plays bigger than what he is PERIOD

 defensive coordinator Tony Gibson said PERIOD
