On a cold snowy November afternoon I type www.walmart.com into my laptops address bar and I am greeted instantly with large brightly colored banners advertising Online Specials framed with a little giftshaped graphic complete with a bow on top PERIOD

Other headlines I see on the site read Your Black Friday Ad is Here and Holiday Hub All the tips tricks recipes and gift ideas to make your season easy and fun. generally the term savings is glued haphazardly onto products ranging from tablets to nauseatingly pink Barbie Dreamhouses PERIOD

The day after Thanksgiving  commercially known as Black Friday  holiday shopping season begins and businesses advertise supposedly tremendous discounts on many of their products PERIOD Todays consumers and corporations seem to honor Black Friday and its familiar customs spending gargantuan amounts of money on merchandise and advertising to reap the most publicity and benefits out of the event PERIOD

Its almost as if weve come to regard Black Friday as its own twisted holiday PERIOD For many shoppers the deals are only part of this monumental day and sales only in part contribute to Black Fridays sometimes violent chaotic infamy PERIOD Its the illusion that Black Friday is an essential holiday festivity that drives so many consumers to forego their warm beds drive to Best Buy and whack an old lady over the head to procure a somewhatdiscounted Xbox PERIOD

Advertisements might claim that Black Friday is all about the deals but to many Americans the event has become an essential holiday tradition at times ridden with barbaric consumerism PERIOD



Walmart unquestionably reaps a good deal of Black Fridays economic benefits PERIOD The corporation claims that last Thanksgiving an estimated  million customers made their way to stores to get their fix of todiefor sales PERIOD They also receive the most negative attention concerning Black Friday PERIOD Stories of shoppers and employees alike being trampled and beat up in the quest for sweet deals have become a staple of the holiday season PERIOD

While its ludicrous that such violence has become commonplace in this holiday shopping day concussions and other injuries incurred in the race to grab the last DVD player off the shelf are not unusual occurrences I think it speaks to how accepted and vital Black Friday participation has become for many PERIOD

On Nov PERIOD  Walmart announced their plans to introduce a New Black Friday into this years holiday season PERIOD In the past Black Friday deals have only been available on late Thanksgiving Thursday and early Friday however this years Black Friday deals will span across the entire week PERIOD

Trends yielding information with regard to who shops on Black Friday and why lead me to believe that Walmarts choice to extend Black Friday over the course of the entire Thanksgiving week will only make the issue of barbaric consumerism grow PERIOD

According to a Womens Wear Daily poll  percent of Black Friday shoppers are showing up to shop simply for the fun experience. now on what planet and in what mindset could the bloodthirsty battle over a PS4 ever be conceived of as fun is completely beyond me PERIOD However the fact remains that Black Friday has come to be perceived as a necessary holiday ritual PERIOD

Thus the fact that deals can just as easily be negotiated either yearround or from the safe comforts of ones iPhone days before Black Friday become irrelevant PERIOD In other words as enthusiastic as consumers may be for the sales Black Fridayers are in it primarily for the spirit of the consumer season PERIOD

I predict that Walmarts decision to advertise and conduct Black Friday as a more liberallypaced longer span of savings opportunities will not alleviate the insane amounts of people that will rush indoors late Thursday night PERIOD Advertising continues to play up the alleged personal economic necessity of Black Friday despite the fact that polls show that more than half of Black Fridayers partake merely for the fun experience PERIOD

Walmarts extension of Black Friday deals over the whole week and into the online realm will likely not help them eliminate the violent unruly spectacles for which their Black Friday sales days have come infamously to be known PERIOD

Until Americans can realign their priorities and not perceive Thanksgiving weekend as a shopping opportunity extraordinaire the violent and inappropriate behaviors associated with the event will persist PERIOD
