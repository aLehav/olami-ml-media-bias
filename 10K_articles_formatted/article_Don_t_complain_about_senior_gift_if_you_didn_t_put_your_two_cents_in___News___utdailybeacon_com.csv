Last Friday The Daily Beacon printed a letter from a concerned

reader who expressed his disdain over the Senior Gift Challenge Steering

Committees recent unveiling of the  gift  a stained glass panel to be

installed in the glass bricks of the John C PERIOD Hodges Library ground floor PERIOD

The writer considered the gift decision to be frivolous and a shame to the

senior class PERIOD

While it is evident that people hold this opinion about this gift and past

ones something must be said in defense of the committee and its

decision PERIOD

This past semester the steering committee sponsored information booths at

the University Center in front of Glocker and right outside Circle Park on

three different occasions to solicit potential gift ideas from the

university community PERIOD Also they held a publicized cookout at Tyson Alumni

House where they also asked for ideas and enlisted members of the student

body to serve on subcommittees to support the committee and organizational

process PERIOD

At each event the consensus of the respondents seemed to be centered

around campus beautification PERIOD So taking these comments into consideration

the steering committee developed different ideas about making the campus

look a little nicer and presented them to Betsey Creekmore associate vice

chancellor for space and facilities planning PERIOD Proposals were shot down for

different reasons but primarily because several of the ideas were already

set to be accomplished by the university in its  or would

somehow interfere with the existing plan PERIOD

But the higheruppers agreed on the glass panel PERIOD The rationale behind the

stained glass goes like this it will provide something esthetically

pleasing to the library that will help to overall spruce up the campus PERIOD

Also the images of the stained glass will be an abstract artistic

rendering of UTs history and be a symbol for which the university

collectively stands PERIOD In other words its what the people asked for PERIOD Maybe

not specifically but close enough PERIOD

The steering committee is not to be blamed tarred or feathered for its

decision PERIOD Instead they should be supported because if not enough money is

raised the stained glass will not be embedded inside the glass blocks PERIOD

Instead the panel will hang inside the library PERIOD So how would you like

that to be your senior gift

The Daily Beacon will take no editorial stance as far as what our

staff thinks of the gift PERIOD Thats not relevant PERIOD But what is important is to

remember that each senior had hisher chance to apply for the committee or

to give resounding comments at the committees highly visible attempts at

finding out what the senior class would like to give PERIOD Now that the decision

has been made whether you support the idea or not support the committee

for its work PERIOD UT has so few longstanding traditions lets not knock the

ones we do have PERIOD

Future seniors let this be a warning to you if you are going to let

others lead you and do the work for you dont be apathetic when they ask

for your help and by all means grin and bear it later if you dont put in

your two cents worth PERIOD

The Senior Gift Steering Committee will set up an information booth on

Tuesday at the University Center to tell people about the gift the

fundraising project and the logistics of the installation PERIOD Go by and talk

to them before you pass judgment PERIOD
