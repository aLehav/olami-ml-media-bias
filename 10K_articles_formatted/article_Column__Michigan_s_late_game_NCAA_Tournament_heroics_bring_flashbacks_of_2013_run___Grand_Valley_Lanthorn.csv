As sports fans we all have highlights from our favorite teams that we will remember for the rest of our lives PERIOD We all have those moments where we will remember exactly where we were sitting and who we were with when we witnessed them PERIOD

As a loyal Detroit sports fan Ive experienced more heartbreak than the pleasure of witnessing those moments in the past five years PERIOD But what I will remember for a long time is exactly where I was on the night of March   PERIOD

It was a Friday night which for an eighthgrade me usually meant hanging out with my friends and playing video games PERIOD But this Friday night was different as I watched the fourseeded University of Michigan Wolverines take on the No PERIOD  seed Kansas Jayhawks in the Sweet  of the greatest tournament in modern sports PERIOD

I sat next to my dad on the couch and watched as it looked like Michigans run was coming to a close PERIOD The Jayhawks looked dominant and were up by  with seven minutes left in the game and my dad and I had all but given up on the team PERIOD But when all hope was seemingly lost National Player of the Year Trey Burke happened PERIOD

Down  Burke ran off a weak screen followed by center Mitch McGary setting what may have been a very illegal yet powerful screen on Elijah Johnson knocking him to the ground and allowing Burke the space he needed to pull up right next to coach John Beilein and hit one of the most clutch 3pointers the NCAA tournament has seen in the past  years to tie the game PERIOD

Michigan proceeded to dominate in overtime and upset the Jayhawks to continue their tournament run PERIOD It wasnt until that shot from Burke that I truly started to believe this basketball team could go all the way as they continued on their magical run beating Florida and Syracuse before losing to the Louisville CheatersI mean Cardinals sorry Im still bitterin the National Championship PERIOD

That rather wordy anecdote all boils down to one fact all sports fans know to be true in their hearts Every magical championship run usually features one lucky yet clutch shot along the way that causes the fans to truly believe in destiny and that their team can make a run PERIOD

I may have felt that same lucky feeling again the night of Saturday March  when Michigans Jordan Poole pulled up from deep and chucked up a buzzer beater to send the Wolverines to this years Sweet  PERIOD After seeing that shot and the passion on the players faces as they chased Poole around that Wichita court I truly bought into this team being able to make a run again PERIOD

I have always been a big believer that to win a National Championship every college basketball team needs three things a little bit of NBA talent lockdown defense and the ability to heat up from 3point range at any moment PERIOD This is the formula that has been the most successful in the past  years just like when UConn rode the momentum of Kemba Walker and Shabazz Napier to two championships in the past seven seasons PERIOD

When it comes to this years tournament this Michigan team follows that formula almost perfectly PERIOD Beileins spacing on offensealong with the shooting of Poole and Duncan Robinsonmakes Michigan dangerous from 3point range every game PERIOD New assistant coaches DeAndre Haynes and Luke Yaklich have finally gotten this team to play defense this season as they can pressure ball handlers and protect the rim much better than teams in years past PERIOD

And while this team may not have the sheer NBA talent the  team did the prospects are still there PERIOD If big man Moritz Wagner leaves for the draft hes a definite firstround lock in the draft PERIOD And upperclassmen guards Muhammad Ali AbdurRahkman and Charles Matthews not only lead this team emotionally but they also have the scoring ability to earn small roles on an NBA roster one day PERIOD

After a very wild first weekend in this years NCAA Tournament No PERIOD  seeded Michigan is now the highest seed in their region PERIOD To make it back to the NCAA Championship game they will not have to face a team seeded higher than they are which is an exciting yet scary thought to think about with how mad this March has been PERIOD

But deep down this team feels like a team of destiny to me PERIOD They won the Big  Tournament for the second year in a row PERIOD Yes they didnt play up to their standard during the first two tournament games against Montana and Houston PERIOD They also needed overtime to beat the lowly Iowa Hawkeyes in their first game in the Big  Tournament a month weeks prior PERIOD After this hump they were able to dominate Nebraska Michigan State and Purdue proving that while this team may start off tournaments slowly they can get hot in a hurry and have the ability to beat the top teams in the country PERIOD

Tim Hardaway Jr. Mitch McGary Glenn Robinson III Nik Stauskas Caris Levert Jordan Morgan Spike Albrecht Burke PERIOD These are the players who made the  run possible and they will all hold a special place in my heart PERIOD But this  team can do something those guys never did finish the job and win the championship PERIOD

And in a year full of NCAA scandals FBI investigations and many sketchy characters wouldnt it be poetic justice for Michigan to win it all this year Louisvilles  banner was taken down earlier this year as many Michigan fans cheered and believe that banner should now hang in the Crisler Center PERIOD

Winning a banner of our own this season just feels like the next logical step on this lengthy path of destiny to avenge those heroes of the  team previously mentioned PERIOD And after seeing this years team dominate contenders this season with great defense solid coaching and a few miraculous shots Im left with only one question

Whos stopping them
