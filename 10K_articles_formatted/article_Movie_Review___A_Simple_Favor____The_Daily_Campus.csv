Anna Kendrick plays a seemingly perfect mommy blogger named Stephanie who quickly befriends the stylish yet mysterious Emily PERIOD While their sons have play dates Stephanie and Emily drink gin martinis and divulge their darkest secrets PERIOD When Emily suddenly disappears Stephanie becomes obsessed with finding her best friend only to be devastated when Emilys body is reportedly recovered from a lake PERIOD Stephanie honors her best friends memory by moving into Emilys house with Emilys son Nikki and husband Sean PERIOD Stephanie becomes the mother and wife Emily never was PERIOD Much to Stephanies horror Emily doesnt seem gone for good just yet PERIOD Stephanie becomes determined to uncover the truth of what actually happened to Emily PERIOD

The director Paul Feig is known for comedy movies like Bridesmaids and Spy and comedy shows like The Office and Parks and Recreation. i was surprised to  find he was the director of A Simple Favor which was a much darker film than his typical laughoutloud funny movies PERIOD Although the movie is filled with mystery and suspense it was also very stylish full of glamorous outfits and saucy French pop music PERIOD

It was also refreshing to see Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively take on different roles than their usual characters PERIOD Both their characters in A Simple Favor have dark secrets PERIOD They arent the innocent pretty faces they seem to be PERIOD As always Blake Lively looked stunning in every scene and had an even more beautiful closet filled with designer clothing PERIOD Her pinstripe suits and cane perfectly added to her devious character leaving the audience a little bit envious of her PERIOD

The central themes of the movie went a little awry with twists and betrayals secrets and revelations love and loyalty and murder and revenge PERIOD The movie seemed to be taking one direction at first and then flipped a completely different direction about halfway through PERIOD It wasnt until the very end when all chaos broke out and left the audience reeling with questions PERIOD

Overall the movie was thrilling and kept the audience on the edge of their seats until the very end PERIOD The final scene was a bit much and unbelievably dramatic but it seemed to be the overall intention behind the directors vision for the movie PERIOD
