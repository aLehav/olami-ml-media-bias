Where do I begin The impact The Daily Nebraskan has had on my life cant be put into words PERIOD I started here as a copy editor my freshman year stepping foot into the DN office before I had been to a single class PERIOD And I never left working my way from the copy desk to a culture reporter to coeditor of the COVID section to editorinchief with many stops in between PERIOD In many ways the DN was my college education teaching me so much about journalism leadership perseverance and more PERIOD

Joining the DN was one of the best choices Ive ever made PERIOD I found so many people who I hope will remain in my life for a long time huge shoutout to my podcast pals Kyle and Mia PERIOD I grew up a lot here looking back at the green freshman I once was I realize that the DN helped shape me in ways I didnt even understand PERIOD

Ive been honored to lead this publication this last year navigating pandemic protocols and countless major stories from the sexual assault protests to start the school year to one of the most dramatic student government elections in years PERIOD It certainly wasnt easy and there were times that were challenging frustrating and downright discouraging PERIOD But the bad only served to heighten the good and I was so lucky to have a wonderful team to get through it together PERIOD

I said my goodbyes to my friends and colleagues just around a month ago at our endofsemester banquet but Im glad Ive had the time since and the rest of June to slowly finally look around and take in everything this place has given me PERIOD I leave very confident that the DN is in the good hands of my successor Zeke Williams PERIOD

But even though Im about to leave for good I know that this place will never truly leave my life PERIOD There will always be a special place in my heart for the DN PERIOD Im excited to soon join the ranks of the alumni following the DNs work each day and thinking back to when I was helping make it happen PERIOD Its a sad thought that I wont work here ever again but I am eternally grateful for this place and time in my life PERIOD

Thank you all for your continuous support of the DN allowing so many students the opportunities to walk through these doors and make a difference with the time they have PERIOD Im looking forward to doing the same PERIOD

Best regards
