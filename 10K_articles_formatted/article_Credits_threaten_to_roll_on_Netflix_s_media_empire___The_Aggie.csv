Netflix the company credited with changing the way we rent movies is undergoing some growing pains and much like any adolescent the company is alienating those closest to it PERIOD

The month of September has not been good to the movie rental company losing content providers and consumers alike PERIOD First its contract with Starz evaporated causing hundreds of titles to vanish from Netflixs expansive library PERIOD

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings attempted to downplay the loss assuring subscribers and shareholders in a press release that  We can take the money we had earmarked for Starz next year and spend it with other content providers to maintain or even improve the Netflix experience. shareholders were unconvinced by Hastings optimism and stocks fell nearly  percent PERIOD

Further problems arose when Netflix announced fee increases PERIOD Where once one could receive a DVD by mail and stream any number of movies over the internet for . a month now the two services would be separated each with a monthly price tag of . pERIOD Renters balked causing Netflix to lower its projected subscribers by one million for  PERIOD

Seeing the panic as a failure to communicate the company tried to clarify its position by separating the two services into two separate companies  Netflix the movie streaming service  and Quikster the new DVD by mail company PERIOD

Hastings issued a public apology saying he messed up and owed everyone an explanation but simultaneously claimed the split was necessary and best. many felt there were three main advantages to a subscription affordability breadth of content and convenience PERIOD By splitting its services in half it would appear all three of those traits have been degraded PERIOD

Many protest the fee increase is greedy and inane amid a recession in which entertainment is considered a luxury good PERIOD Many customers are canceling their subscriptions because they now find it unaffordable PERIOD

The average person of university age range cant afford  a month we could afford  said Amanda Faig a graduate student of agronomy PERIOD When price goes up demand goes down. if a subscriber chooses to ignore the fee hike opting for only one service he will be forced to choose between content and convenience PERIOD By dividing their streaming and mail services Netflix has forced customers to choose between their much larger DVD library with Quikster and the convenience of being able to instantly stream a movie online with Netflixs comparatively smaller collection PERIOD

The big advantage of Netflix was you could get stuff that was harder to find said Jesse Drew a UC Davis professor of technocultural studies PERIOD People want the convenience of streaming but their offering of online content is being squeezed. faig confirmed Drews sentiment PERIOD

I dont care to see Human Centipede available for livestream Faig said PERIOD I would like to see Sixteen Candles but then Id have to pay extra. why then has Netflix a company with a once effective business model so drastically changed its ways There are two main reasons PERIOD First Netflix lost money on each DVD it shipped about . to the film studio in addition to the ever rising cost of sending a DVD via snail mail PERIOD The apparently unsustainable model would explain Hastings comment that DVD by mail may not last forever. secondly many argue the shift to streaming was inevitable PERIOD

Netflixs whole aim which I agree with was streaming said Justin Knight a senior optical science and engineering major PERIOD

For many customers streamed content has been viewed as the more convenient option for some time and other companies such as Amazon and Apple now offer streaming services of their own PERIOD

Hastings and his company will face significant challenges to secure digital content in the coming months as they must compete with other distributors PERIOD

Their streaming service is threatened heavily by other people who want the same content Drew said PERIOD

Take for instance the failed deal with Starz PERIOD The initial deal signed several years ago was worth  million this is opposed to the nearly identical contract which failed earlier this month the value of which was estimated at  million PERIOD This competition for content poses a serious threat to Netflix as it attempts to move into a streaming only paradigm PERIOD

Remember Amazon and Apples streaming services With Netflix looking to abandon its DVD by mail service it has now placed itself in direct competition with these companies PERIOD

Amazon and Apple both have immense infrastructural advantages IT advantages and in Apples case an advantage on the hardware side said Andrew Hargadon a professor of technology management at UC Davis Graduate School of Management PERIOD Their prospects for competing were pretty slim  this just hastens their demise. with its stocks continuing to tumble and customers still canceling their subscriptions there is a very real chance Netflixs decline may be terminal PERIOD  For now the ship stays afloat but in the long term the company credited for bankrupting Blockbuster may be due for its own curtain call PERIOD
