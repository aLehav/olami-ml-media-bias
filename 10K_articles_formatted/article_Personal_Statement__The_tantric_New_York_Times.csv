Reading the Sunday New York Times is better than sex a friend of mine once remarked a few years ago PERIOD

Being unfamiliar with the paper at the time I couldnt validate his statement PERIOD But it gave me pause PERIOD The Sunday Times must really be something I thought if hes arguing that its better than sex PERIOD So I started reading PERIOD

Originally I bought the paper every Sunday at Starbucks on State Street PERIOD But this became too risky  if I showed up any later than noon Id walk in and find an empty newsstand an experience that left me paralyzed with rage and despair PERIOD To prevent any health complications I soon switched to home delivery PERIOD But this still hasnt completely relieved my anxiety PERIOD

Now I walk outside my apartment every Sunday morning at about  a.m PERIOD to get the paper PERIOD The heart palpitations begin immediately PERIOD I start sweating uncontrollably and my stomach feels like a bundle of knots PERIOD My whole body becomes tense PERIOD It better be there it better be there I murmur under my breath as if this chant will somehow guarantee that my paper has been delivered PERIOD As almost anyone with a subscription will tell you a delivery is anything but certain PERIOD

On those blessed days when I get the paper I take it inside and glance at the content to whet my appetite PERIOD Then I make a pot of coffee put on my beige slippers and go to work PERIOD I delve into the paper absorbing page after page of fascinating stories written in crisp clean prose PERIOD I learn about foreign wars and domestic poverty international intrigue and U.S PERIOD politics PERIOD I learn about anything and everything PERIOD

And so the paper has become a kind of fix PERIOD Ive come to need the knowledge it provides PERIOD Without it I feel incomplete and shamefully ignorant of whats happening in the world PERIOD I feel stranded in Ann Arbor enclosed in the bubble of academia PERIOD The paper is my antidote to oblivion PERIOD

Three years after I first held the Sunday Times in my hands Ive realized that my friends claim reflects an impassioned reverence for the art of print journalism and an enthusiasm for the power of ideas in shaping society PERIOD

But Ive also realized something else  reading the Sunday paper is perhaps not so unlike having sex PERIOD Both are a true art that must be pursued with patience and dedication PERIOD

Just as there are different sex techniques there are different techniques for reading the Sunday Times PERIOD And in both cases some techniques are much more successful than others PERIOD It takes time to discover what works and what doesnt PERIOD If youre impatient in both cases things are bound to go less than smoothly PERIOD

Since Ive been reading the Sunday Times Ive worked tirelessly to come up with a way to peruse the entire paper in a reasonable amount of time three hours PERIOD Ive spent long hours trying to hone my craft PERIOD After all this toil I think Ive finally developed an efficient strategy PERIOD

First I read every word of text on the front page of the paper paying particular attention to the lead top right of the page and offlead top left stories for the day PERIOD That way I have a sense of whats the most important news which helps in understanding other sections of the paper like the opinion pieces and political cartoons PERIOD Once Ive read the front page I move quickly through the International and National Reports scanning the headline and first paragraph of each article PERIOD

With a solid briefing on major news I then tackle two sections in rapid succession Arts and Sunday Styles PERIOD For Arts I restrict myself to reading the major movie reviews especially those written by A.O PERIOD Scott the Times chief movie critic whose commentary I find irresistibly keen and insightful PERIOD The Sunday Styles section which features articles on the latest trends can be hit or miss PERIOD I once had the pleasure of reading an intriguing piece on how Obamas love of basketball distinguishes him from past presidents whose sports of choice have often been tennis or golf PERIOD But I also had the misfortune of reading an article about men who are obsessed with their cats PERIOD

Next come the Business Travel and Sports sections none of which I spend much time reading PERIOD In fact I seldom read Travel mostly because I dont have the money or time to take any of the trips it suggests PERIOD In the Business section I only read the feature article and the stock reports PERIOD If anything really notable happened in business itll be in the National Report or at least thats what I tell myself PERIOD For Sports I look at the front page to see if there are any cool pictures PERIOD Even though I really dont read them I still feel compelled to at least look at these sections PERIOD

It may seem like Ive been doing a lot of picking and choosing PERIOD Thats because I spend virtually all my time reading the Book Review the Week in Review and the Sunday Magazine PERIOD For me these three sections constitute the cornerstone of the Sunday Times PERIOD They represent the climax of my week an orgasm of incisive news analysis and literary reviews PERIOD On some wintry Sunday mornings these sections are the only reason I get out of bed PERIOD

In the Book Review I start with the cover article and then read each successive review especially those on books about foreign policy PERIOD Theres one element of the Book Review though that makes it indispensable since the reviews are so comprehensive it becomes unnecessary to actually read the books themselves PERIOD When youre short on both time and money this proves really helpful PERIOD

The Week in Review and Sunday Magazine are both invaluable for their extensive political commentary and cultural analysis PERIOD For the Week in Review I have a routine I read the feature stories first then the political cartoons and opinion pieces PERIOD Of the four Sunday columnists I find two essential Thomas Friedman on foreign policy and the environment and Nicholas Kristof on humanitarian problems PERIOD The other two Maureen Dowd and Frank Rich are liberal satirists whose ranting can become trite after a few columns PERIOD

In the Sunday Magazine I first read The Way We Live Now a column on current events and cultural trends PERIOD I then read the weekly interview which typically features a prominent person in politics Karl Rove or the arts Sheryl Crow PERIOD Next comes William Safires column On Language in which he examines the etymology of words that are often used in the media PERIOD A recent column discussed the subtle differences among the words profanity obscenity expletive vulgarity execration epithet and imprecation. finally I read the cover story which is almost always relevant and illuminating PERIOD

So thats what I do for three hours every Sunday PERIOD Yes its timeconsuming PERIOD Yes the whole endeavor may seem a bit strange PERIOD But thats how I remind myself that theres more to life than homework PERIOD Reading the Sunday Times is my reward for all those sleepless nights spent studying at the UGLi PERIOD Its a reminder to myself that I can learn without being graded and that an intellectual dialogue exists outside the classroom PERIOD

The Sunday Times may or may not be better than sex PERIOD But if you havent had much luck at Scorekeepers lately it might be worth checking out PERIOD
