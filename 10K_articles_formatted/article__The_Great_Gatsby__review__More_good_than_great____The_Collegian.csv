4041,2018-05-06,"in the case of this film perhaps great is too strong of a word PERIOD Maybe The Good Gatsby would be more appropriate PERIOD



For those who slept through high school English The Great Gatsby was originally a novel by F PERIOD Scott Fitzgerald first published in  PERIOD Set in Long Island New York in  Nick Carraway Tobey Maguire is the storys narrator PERIOD He is a war veteran who moves to New York from the Midwest to sell bonds in a booming market PERIOD

He buys a house in the village of West Egg which consists mainly of millionaires PERIOD Carraways neighbor is none other than Jay Gatsby Leonardo DiCaprio the renowned party thrower PERIOD

Directed by the heavily criticized Baz Luhrmann of Romeo  Juliet and Moulin Rouge fame he shows us that you can indeed repeat the past PERIOD Luhrmanns take on Gatsby rings as somewhat of a greatest hits compilation PERIOD

Just like Romeo  Juliet he uses dialogue verbatim from the novel PERIOD Having just reread the novel I can attest that much of the screenplay is comprised of Fitzgeralds original dialogue for better or worse PERIOD

Similar to his attempt at a musical with 1998s Moulin Rouge Luhrmanns soundtrack is full of anachronistic songs PERIOD In perhaps his most perplexing decision the rap music in the trailer is not just there for promotional purposes it is actually in the movie PERIOD

The era of the 1920s could easily provide a memorable score but Luhrmann instead chooses to rely on the recognition factor PERIOD Not everyone would think to add music from rapper Shawn JayZ Carter to a story set in the 20s but Luhrmann does PERIOD Or perhaps it was not his choice at all seeing as JayZ is an executive producer on the film PERIOD

Luhrmann has a style and he sticks with it here this timein needless 3D.His version of Gatsby is heavily stylized PERIOD It walks right up to the edge of being overly so but stops right before taking that jump PERIOD

What does not work in the film certainly has nothing to do with DiCaprio who remind everyone why he is a movie star PERIOD In his role as the title character he delivers an emotional performance that helps this film rise above its director PERIOD

Honestly he saves this picture PERIOD While Luhrmann seemingly tries to get in the way DiCaprio delivers a performance that keeps the film in check PERIOD He was the perfect choice for such an important and tragic character PERIOD

Much of the casting is spot on PERIOD Carey Mulligan plays Daisy Buchanan Carraways second cousin and the object of Gatsbys affection PERIOD She is equal parts alluring and frustrating expertly maneuvering the conflicted nature of character PERIOD

The only suspect casting is Maguire as Carraway PERIOD Due to the bythebook nature Luhrmann chose to stick to Carraway narrates the whole film a task Maguire is not entirely fit for PERIOD Maguire can be good but in this role he comes off a bit on the whiney side PERIOD That is a problem when you considering how large of a role he plays in the film PERIOD

Despite all the questionable cinematic choices from the writerdirector the acting makes this is a solid adaptation of one of the great American novels PERIOD But it is indeed clear that the film could have been better in a different directors hands PERIOD

The Great Gatsby a Warner Bros PERIOD release is rated PG13 for some violent images sexual content smoking partying and brief language PERIOD Running time  minutes PERIOD B
