A BernEaters victory concluded the yearlong ASUCI Campus Debate Series last Thursday with its final debate Immigration and the Humanitarian Crisis What obligation does the US have towards those seeking to emigrate to the US

The debate hosted by ASUCIs  by  commission featured members of UCI College Republicans UCI College Democrats Anteaters for Bernie Sanders BernEaters and UCI Young Americans for Liberty PERIOD

At Thursdays event Bryan Sanchez and Giovanni Chavez represented College Democrats Rob Petrosyan and Carl Olson led the College Republicans and Aya Labanieh and William Leonard spoke for the BernEaters PERIOD

The debate was moderated by Mitchell Sterns and Justine Hernandez of the Young Americans for Liberty and Matthew Carlson atlarge Representative for ASUCI PERIOD

Throughout the debate the BernEaters highlighted how Bernie Sanderss immigration policies incorporate an economic as well as a very humane perspective. they noted that reformation of Americas visa program and more pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants are major cornerstones of Sanderss immigration reform policies PERIOD

The first question regarded the usage of the terms undocumented or illegal to refer to immigrants without documentation PERIOD The BernEaters and the College Democrats opposed the term illegal due to its dehumanizing nature PERIOD The College Republicans condoned the term illegal stating that these immigrants did not just forget their visas. the moderators then asked whether the US should favor skilled workers over unskilled workers and refugees PERIOD The College Democrats refuted the favoring of skilled labor calling it undemocratic arguing that In this instance you have to let the free market take its course. this sentiment was mirrored by the College Republicans PERIOD The BernEaters supported a preference for refugees because they are the most vulnerable citizens in society. moderators then asked for debaters positions on Trumps ban on Muslims in the US PERIOD The College Republicans agreed that the ban is unconstitutional but were divided on the moral acceptability of the ban and qualified that Trumps ban is merely a call to heighten the vetting process and restrict immigration from Muslim majority countries. this qualification of Trumps ban on Muslims was refuted by the BernEaters PERIOD The College Democrats too argued that it is impossible to definitively identify someone by their religion asking Why do we assume that a terrorist will just walk in and have a label that identifies his religion College Democrats claimed this would set a precedent to ban any people from any other country. when asked whether immigration helped or hurt the the US economy the BernEaters claimed that immigrants regardless of status fill a still growing gap expanding lowskilled jobs and a shrinking pool of nativeborn Americans. the College Republicans conceded that immigrants provide a great benefit to American culture and society but preferred them coming here through the proper procedures. college Republicans also claimed that immigrants drain Social Security PERIOD

College Democrats and BernEaters refuted this claim by citing the fiveyear waiting time for even legal immigrants to get Social Security benefits PERIOD College Democrats noted that Immigrants pay  billion in Social Security annually but only receive one billion in benefits

Regarding the concern of Syrian refugees bringing in ISIS agents College Democrats claimed that of the  refugees that have been settled in the US after  only three have been potential terrorists. the College Republicans raised concerns on the vetting of these refugees and ISISs infiltration programs PERIOD They insisted that the US establish safe zones in Syria and wealthier Middle East nations while admitting orphaned children minimizing the security threat while still trying to be humanitarian. the BernEaters argued that the US has barely accepted  Syrian refugees in a period of more than four years in an incredibly extensive and meticulous process that can take over two years PERIOD

The debate also covered the topic of the USs birthright citizenship policy PERIOD All camps believed in the validity of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution and refuted any change to it PERIOD

College Democrats concluded the debate by answering a question about the impact of cultural appropriation PERIOD They argued for the importance of respecting another culture without making a mockery of it and the BernEaters agreed while also stating that there is a difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation. the College Republicans stated that cultural appropriation is a historic thing that has always happened across all big civilizations and proceeded to place a sombrero and an ushanka on their heads during the debate PERIOD They did concede that appropriation such as blackface is reprehensible but not common PERIOD

After the moderators concluded their questions the debaters fielded questions directly from the audience addressing topics such as how the drug wars in Mexico affect the morality of USs immigration policies the political and economic logistics of Trumps wall for Mexico and Muslim immigration in Europe PERIOD

Justine Hernandez who has attended all the debates this year believes that the series has encouraged political discourse on campus and helped develop the viewpoints of student attendees PERIOD

It is really useful for people who dont currently have views can come in here and hear all these different sides of the the issues said Hernandez PERIOD
