 Sarkisian said PERIOD

But this rivalry clash between the No PERIOD  Longhorns and No PERIOD  Sooners played in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas in the middle of the State Fair of Texas isnt like any other game PERIOD

The atmosphere the crowd  split down the 50yard line between Texas and Oklahoma fans  and the leadup all make it different from any other game on the schedule PERIOD

 Oklahoma wide receiver Jayden Gibson said PERIOD 

For the forty-third time in the series long history Texas and Oklahoma enter the contest with both teams ranked PERIOD

The Longhorns   Big  have biggame experience this season having knocked off thenNo PERIOD  Alabama  back on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

 Sarkisian said PERIOD 

Oklahoma   hasnt been tested nearly so much as this will be its first game against a ranked opponent PERIOD

But the Sooners are in much better shape entering this years matchup than they were last year when Oklahoma entered on a twogame losing streak and without quarterback Dillon Gabriel who was knocked out the previous week with an injury PERIOD

Without Gabriel the Sooners threw for just  yards and Texas grabbed its biggest win in the series history  PERIOD

 Venables said PERIOD 

The quarterbacks figure to go a long way toward deciding the game PERIOD

Last season Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers threw for  yards and four touchdowns with an interception PERIOD

Hes been excellent this season completing nearly twothirds of his passes for  yards  touchdowns and an interception PERIOD He has also run for five scores PERIOD

Gabriel has put up even better numbers completing better than  percent of his passes for  yards and  touchdowns with two interceptions PERIOD He has four rushing touchdowns PERIOD

But both defenses have plenty of teeth ranking in the top  nationally in points allowed per game in the top  in thirddown defense top  in turnover margin and top  in total defense PERIOD

 Gabriel said of the Longhorns defense PERIOD 

For the Sooners thats a major turnaround from last season when they struggled defensively in Venables first season PERIOD
