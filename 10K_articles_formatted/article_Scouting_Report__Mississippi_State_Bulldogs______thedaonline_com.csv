If a midseason nonconference game doesnt seem unnatural enough the conference affiliation of No PERIOD  West Virginia Universitys opponent this weekend might prompt a double take PERIOD

Mississippi State will be heading into Morgantown Saturday afternoon the first time a Southeastern Conference team has done so since Kentucky in  at the old Mountaineer Field PERIOD

In just the second meeting between the teams the Mountaineers  are actually looking to improve on last years blowout victory against the Bulldogs  PERIOD

While the  win in Starkville Miss. was fine it was the  penalties for  yards that put a damper on the afternoon and made Mountaineer head coach Rich Rodriguez livid PERIOD

Its been over a year since that game but the state of either program hasnt changed much PERIOD

WVU is a top  team and favored to win whereas MSU is near the bottom of the SEC ranks and desperate for an upset PERIOD

But the Bulldogs have played the part of spoiler already this season in upsetting nowNo PERIOD  Auburn last month PERIOD They also held a thirdquarter lead against nowNo PERIOD  South Carolina and played close with nowNo PERIOD  Tennessee for the majority of the game last week PERIOD

Sure the program hasnt made a Herculean turnaround but its already improved on last years  record PERIOD

 Rodriguez said PERIOD

Heres a look at what the Bulldogs are bringing into Morgantown PERIOD

Pass Offense

The Bulldogs are ranked last in the SEC in passing offense with . passing yards per game and only five passing touchdowns but the numbers dont paint the entire picture PERIOD

Opening day starting quarterback Michael Henig broke his hand at Auburn and the team has had to turn to true freshman Wesley Carroll to play under center PERIOD The Bulldogs are also a runfirst team throwing on less than  percent of their plays through seven games PERIOD

Carroll has improved steadily since becoming a part of the lineup and had the best game of his career against Tennessee where he threw for  yards and two touchdowns PERIOD Also in his  attempts the young starter has yet to throw an interception PERIOD

Senior wide receiver Tony Burks is MSUs most experienced wideout in a group that lacks for it PERIOD Burks  217pound frame could provide some trouble for WVUs secondary PERIOD

Grade D

Run Offense

Behind sophomore running back Anthony Dixon the Bulldogs physical running game has become the bread and butter of their offense PERIOD

Dixons  rushing yards is the fifthbest total in the SEC PERIOD Hes also the teams main scoring threat as his  rushing touchdowns lead the team and the conference PERIOD

The 240pound back doesnt have mindblowing speed like most of the Mountaineers skill players but he is durable and takes lots of carries PERIOD

When Dixon does need to take a break fellow sophomore Christian Ducre has performed well in backing up the teams star PERIOD He has  yards and averages . yards per rush PERIOD

Senior Royce Blackledge leads the Bulldog offensive line and has started the last  games at center PERIOD For his efforts he has been named to the Rimington Trophy watch list for best center PERIOD

Grade B

Pass Defense

On the other side of the ball MSU is like most of the other teams in the SEC fast PERIOD So fast that the team reminds Rodriguez of another quick defense that stymied his team earlier this season PERIOD

 Rodriguez said PERIOD

Junior free safety Derek Pegues fresh off a careerhigh 10tackle day was named to the Jim Thorpe Award watch list for best defensive back PERIOD Over his career Pegues has intercepted seven passes and brought three back for touchdowns a school record PERIOD

Aside from Pegues and strong safety DeMon Glanton the Bulldogs secondary  despite its speed  is very young PERIOD

Grade C

Rush Defense

After West Virginias Steve Slaton gouged the Bulldogs for  yards in last seasons game MSU did not give up another 100yard rusher until Tennessees Arian Foster put up  yards last week PERIOD

The Bulldogs run defense which gives up  yards per game ranks sixth in the conference which is not a bad place to be considering the elite defenses that call the SEC home PERIOD

Speedy senior defensive ends Titus Brown and Avery Hannibal stand out on the defensive live and are among the chief causes for the teams stout stance against the run PERIOD

Brown ranks third in the SEC in sacks with six PERIOD His nine tackles for a loss are fifth best in the league PERIOD

Jamar Chaney Dominic Douglas and Gave ONeal make up a trio of suretackling linebackers for the Bulldogs PERIOD

MSUs front seven has a lot of experience and speed but taking on one of the best running attacks in the nation after its had a bye week is an unenviable task PERIOD

Grade B

Overall

Mississippi State is coming off a game against Tennessee that was closer than the final score indicated and has played well against ranked teams this season save their season opener at LSU PERIOD

But the Mountaineers should be wellrested after their week off and have plenty of speed and athleticism to counter the Bulldogs PERIOD They should also get a nice boost from playing in front of their home crowd for the first time in almost a month on Homecoming weekend PERIOD

Score West Virginia  Mississippi State
