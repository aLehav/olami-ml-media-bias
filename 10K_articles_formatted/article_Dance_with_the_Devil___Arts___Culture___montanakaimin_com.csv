A Ghost guitar player solosat The Wilma Theatre on Sunday Oct PERIOD   PERIOD

October is known for its ties to the occult and all things spooky so its only logical that a band called Ghost made its first Missoula appearance during this darkest month PERIOD The Satanic doom metal group invaded the Wilma Sunday evening and praising Lucifer has never been more appealing PERIOD

Ghost hails from Sweden the land of ice ABBA and a healthy appreciation of all things metal PERIOD Lead vocalist Papa Emeritus III and the five supporting members known as Nameless Ghouls followed in the Nordic tradition of bringing righteous rock to the masses PERIOD

Gregorian chants and billowing clouds of smoke set the scene before Ghost arrived dressed all in black PERIOD They jumped straight into their latest single Square Hammer. what followed was a crowdpleasing twohour set that played to all the bands strengths PERIOD Ghost loves its convoluted guitar riffs and morose lyrics as much as the next heavy metal group but also takes a cue from fellow poploving Swedes and adds genuinely catchy melodies and vocal harmonies to the mix PERIOD Emeritus vocal performance was near flawless PERIOD The instrumentalists were just as lively PERIOD The combination was intoxicating and a perfect fit for the stage PERIOD

Fan favorite tracks like Cirice Con Clavi Con Dio and the epic doubleheader GhulehZombie Queen went down a scream PERIOD Fans clad in Nameless Ghoul masks or skull makeup threw up the classic rock hand gesture known as the sign of the horns. its obvious that Papa Emeritus and his minions are fantastic showmen PERIOD Emeritus decked out in full papal costume and facial prosthetics commanded the theater with menacing glares PERIOD At times his movements were reminiscent of a demonic conductor the crowds screams crescendoing or silencing at his will PERIOD The Nameless Ghouls supported him with infectious energy jumping and wailing on electric guitars drums and a keyboard PERIOD A keytar solo even made an appearance late in the show PERIOD

Really the experience can be summed up in two words Hail Satan. ghost a Grammy awardwinning metal band fromSweden played The Wilma Theatre on Sunday night Oct PERIOD   as part of their new tour supporting their album
