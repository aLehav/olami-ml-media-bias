The verbal commitments didnt exactly pour in this summer for the Penn State football team but considering the fact that they have only  scholarships to give the Nittany Lions had a good start PERIOD

Three high school seniors have made verbal commitments to sign with the Lions on letter of intent day Feb PERIOD  PERIOD The Lions beat out major competition to reach preliminary accords with defensive lineman John Shaw linebacker Paul Posluszny and tailback Jason Evans PERIOD

John Shaw

Height  Weight  pounds

Defensive Lineman

Spring Grove H.S. spring Grove Pa PERIOD

Shaw was the first player to sign with the Lions doing so on July  PERIOD The athletic defensive lineman registered  sacks last season and also played guard on the other side of the ball to help lead Spring Grove to a  record and a firstround playoff victory PERIOD

Shaw has the size strength speed and athleticism for Div PERIOD I PERIOD That was enough to get him attention across the country beginning in the spring and scholarship offers from Notre Dame Miami Virginia Tech Boston College Colorado and Maryland among others PERIOD Instead of allowing those teams to continue courting him Shaw decided to get it over with early PERIOD

 Shaw said PERIOD 

The last two schools on Shaws list were Penn State and Notre Dame PERIOD He felt that he couldnt go wrong either way but he liked the Penn State coaches and was influenced by the fact that Spring Grove is just a   hour drive from State College PERIOD

 Shaw said PERIOD 

Paul Posluszny

Height  Weight  pounds

Linebacker

Hopewell H.S. aliquippa Pa PERIOD

The Lions used stories of their linebacker tradition to sneak Posluszny out of Western Pennsylvania PERIOD Though Pittsburgh put a lot of effort into recruiting the hometown linebacker Posluszny was a Penn State fan and decided that State College wasnt too far away from home for him to sign on PERIOD

 he said PERIOD And with the history of Linebacker U how could I pass that up

Posluszny played running back and linebacker for Hopewell leading the Vikings to the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League championship game before they lost to eventual state champion West Allegheny PERIOD Posluszny the first Div PERIOD I recruit from Hopewell since  was AllParkway Conference in both positions and rushed for  yards and  touchdowns as a running back PERIOD He will likely work solely as a linebacker for the Lions PERIOD

Along with Pittsburgh Posluszny was also offered scholarships by Purdue Northwestern and Maryland PERIOD

Jason Evans

Height  PERIOD Weight  pounds

Tailback

Harrison H.S. kennesaw Ga PERIOD

The latest addition to the Penn State recruiting class may be the most promising PERIOD Evans is rated by many recruiting sources as one of the top running backs in the country and he comes at a time when the Lions could use some help at the position PERIOD

Starter Larry Johnson is in his senior season and Paterno hasnt been extremely impressed by the play of sophomore backups Mike Gasparato and Pete Gilmore so it seems likely that the five true freshman running backs will have a shot at playing time next year PERIOD Evans could also be in that mix PERIOD

Evans has the athletic ability to eventually do a lot more than that PERIOD He boasts a . second 40yard dash time and a 36inch vertical leap PERIOD He rushed for  yards and  touchdowns for Harrison last season leading them to the second round of the playoffs PERIOD

Evans chose Penn State over Stanford and Texas AM PERIOD
