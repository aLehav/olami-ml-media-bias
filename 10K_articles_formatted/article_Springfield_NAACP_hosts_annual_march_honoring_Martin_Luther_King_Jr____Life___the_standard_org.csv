Participants were encouraged to choose one of the days over the weekend to walk or drive a predetermined path according to the Springfield NAACP website PERIOD

To ensure social distancing participants are being asked to walk only with others who are already in their household or bubble and maintain a 6foot or greater distance from other participants as they would any time they walk outdoors said Alice Barber Springfield NAACP secretary PERIOD

Barber said since the march was held over the course of multiple days this would limit participants from attending on one day and have them spread out over the weekend PERIOD

The virtual aspect of the march is in the hashtag MOVINGFORWARDFORMLK where participants could take selfies of themselves on the predetermined path as well as in front of Springfields historic sites along the African American Heritage Trail PERIOD

These sites include Silver Spring Park Lincoln Hall Church Square North and South and Park Central Square PERIOD

These landmarks are significant to Springfields history with the African American Heritage Trail providing background on each landmark on their website PERIOD

Silver Springs Park was Springfields only park open to Black residents during segregation PERIOD Lincoln Hall served as the best Black school in the state PERIOD Park Central Square was the location of the lynching of Horace PERIOD B PERIOD Duncan and Fred Coker where a memorial now stands PERIOD Church Square North and South are both home to two historically AfricanAmerican churches PERIOD

These are just a handful of sites along the trail as Springfield has  sites dedicated to the contributions made by those of African descent to the history of the community and are all marked with a descriptive plaque PERIOD

The route of this years MLK march serves much significance as it is also a teaching moment for those unaware of Springfields history and participants were encouraged to visit at least two of the historic sites PERIOD

The march also included prizes like tshirts and gift certificates to Springfields local coffee shops as well as collected donations of warm outerwear for those in need locally PERIOD
