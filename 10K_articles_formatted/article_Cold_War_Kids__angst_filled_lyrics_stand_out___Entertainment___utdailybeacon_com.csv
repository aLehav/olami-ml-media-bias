Lyrics of alienation and melancholy are backed by distorted guitar and hammering bass in the new Cold War Kids album Loyalty to Loyalty. singer Nathan Willetts howling blues voice caught the attention of many when the two singles from their first album Robbers  Cowards got a lot of airplay on college and mainstream radio PERIOD Hang Me Up to Dry which still receives plenty of airplay on The Rock reached No PERIOD  on the modern rock charts in  PERIOD

Their new single Something is Not Right With Me from Loyalty has already reached No PERIOD  on the modern rock charts PERIOD It is definitely a great track with fast guitar riffs and punching vocals but it is not typical of the rest of the album which is decidedly slower than any of their singles PERIOD

This is not to say that the album is bad it just might not be what is expected from the radio PERIOD

Overall the album is unified by Willetts voice which is the most distinct feature of the band and by the lyrical theme running throughout PERIOD The album opens with Against Privacy which is one of the best songs on the album PERIOD It has a strong blues feel to it but it is the lyrics that set the tone for the rest of the album PERIOD

Loyalty builds up in tempo to the single on track four and as convention dictates they slow it down afterwards PERIOD These songs are slower and constructed more simply using less of each instrument but they turn up the indulgent selfpity PERIOD Often it is just Willett backed by soulful plucking of distorted guitar and deceptively simple drum beats singing lyrics like Hows it gonna feel when summer endsOut of Money out of Friends

The only problem is that the album never really picks up again and almost fizzles out PERIOD They are all good songs but none of them really make the last half of the CD stand out PERIOD The only place they really falter is with avalanche in B  the song seems to go for excessive minimalism but does not quite make it PERIOD It just ends up too slow with singing that is too whiny PERIOD

This is small criticism for what overall is a good album PERIOD It could pick one up or bring one down depending on whats needed PERIOD Willetts voice perfectly matches the angst filled lyrics and their combined effect is greater then the sum of their parts  which is another way of saying it is hard to picture any other voice singing these songs PERIOD Combined with the distinct guitars bass and drums it gives the Cold War Kids a sound that sets them apart from almost everyone else PERIOD

For those who enjoy music a little bit slower and grittier and like to feel good about feeling bad then this album might just be perfect PERIOD For everyone else the record is still definitely worth checking out PERIOD
