Entering his fourth year as a starting quarterback Spencer Sanders is working as hard as ever to make this season special PERIOD

On a quest to find the best football video gamer on the OSU football team its obvious who

Wide receiver has been a position coach Mike Gundy and his staff havent been overly concern

For college athletes the abundance of pressure that comes with being a studentathlete can be overbearing PERIOD

OSU sophomore quarterback Gunnar Gundy feels this type of pressure especially PERIOD Not necessarily because of college athletics alone although that plays a huge part in it  but primarily because of his last name PERIOD

The Gundy name has been engraved in the OSU and Stillwater community for decades largely due to the profuse amount of success PERIOD Through  seasons as the head coach Mike Gundy tallied  wins cementing himself as the winningest coach in program history while recording seven seasons with  or more wins  winning seasons two New Years Six bowl victories and the programs first Big  conference title along the way PERIOD

Gunnar felt the burden of carrying that last name on his shoulders throughout his high school career at Stillwater and now during his college career at OSU PERIOD

The first year was awkward Gunnar said PERIOD Everyone is getting used to me being his kid PERIOD My other teammates didnt really know how to react to me at first. for Gunnar the best part of playing in his hometown is simple  fulfilling a lifelong dream of playing college football for OSU PERIOD

Gunnar recalls days and nights of watching Cowboy football games on his home television dressed in an orange OSU jersey occasionally with a helmet around his head PERIOD In those moments the boy would search for his father through the pixels on his home television and watch him pace the sidelines PERIOD

As the years went by Gunnar began to wonder what it would be like to play under his father and potentially be the next Gundy at OSU PERIOD

Ill admit it Ive always wanted to play football at Oklahoma State Gunnar said PERIOD As time went on I wanted to play here and do what my dad did here to a certain extent. gunnar had to develop a level of composure during his high school days and it was much needed PERIOD From chants generated by opposing student sections to sly comments in post game handshakes or ingame action to occasional attacks and negative comments on Twitter the secondyear college quarterback has learned a lot from his past experiences and learned to keep his composure in tense moments PERIOD

Gunnars former coach at Stillwater High School Tucker Barnard says the level of confidence he has shown over the years has built him for moments like this a sentiment hes said since Gunnar won the starting job on varsity his sophomore season PERIOD

When he won the starting job that early I knew the kid was different Barnard said PERIOD If he ever does get to that point of being the starter its going to be really hard PERIOD I can imagine the level of tolerance toward mistakes will be really low and I feel for him in that sense PERIOD But I know its what he wants and I know he can handle it PERIOD He did it in high school he can do it in college. mike also played a part in his sons ability to properly dissect his two personas both on and off the football field by simply letting him grow on his own PERIOD He said as difficult as it may be he realizes in the long run its simply what is best for his son PERIOD

Its extremely difficult for both of us but what I do is I just stay away Mike said PERIOD Its best for me to stay away and let Tim Rattay coach him and let them function and let him make mistakes a freshman quarterback makes and then let him grow and develop. as the  season approaches Gunnar is willing to accept his role on the team PERIOD Whether it be second or third string quarterback staying true to his humble mindset is something he plans to do this year PERIOD

Being here in Stillwater for such a long period of time and being around Oklahoma State and the Cowboys for my entire life basically Ive always wanted to come here Gunnar said PERIOD OSUs always been home in my opinion and I enjoy it too much. sports.edocolly.com
