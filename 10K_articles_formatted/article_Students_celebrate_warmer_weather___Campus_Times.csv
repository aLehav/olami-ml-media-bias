The UR campus livened up this week as students flocked outside to enjoy the warm and sunny weather that came unusually early in the year for Rochester PERIOD Stripped down to their summer clothes to deal with the heat and the humidity many spent as much time as they could outside PERIOD

Groups of students across campus were playing football frisbee stickball hackysack sliding on a slipnslide in the Eastman Quad or just laying around to get a tan and enjoy the pleasant day PERIOD Others lounged in sofas outside listening to loud music or camped outdoors for the day to escape the heat of the dorms PERIOD

Many classes were held outside but a lot of the students found that the day was too nice to focus on academics PERIOD No one wants to sit in a boring dull lecture hall atmosphere when its like this outside sophomore Steve Oswald said who was one of many students to skip classes because of the weather PERIOD

I didnt go to any classes at all PERIOD I just relaxed outside and soaked up the sun said freshman Mason Donovel as he was playing his guitar sitting outside a tent next to the Freshman Quad PERIOD

This weeks sunshine and high temperatures reaching up to 85oF are not normal in Rochester for this time of the year PERIOD Its unusual but it has happened before although rarely said Scott Hetsko chief meteorologist for CBS WROCTV  PERIOD He attributed the hot weather to influence from high pressure zones to the east and south PERIOD Its an Augustlike weather pattern arriving four months early. rochester is not alone in experiencing warmerthanusual weather PERIOD Abnormally high temperatures were recorded all across the midAtlantic and northeast regions of the country PERIOD This spring Central Park reached an alltime record high of 96oF as did Philadelphia with 95oF PERIOD

Senior Rachel Heafitz who is well familiar with typical Rochester weather agrees that this spring is strange and different PERIOD I got sunburned in the middle of April which Ive never done at the time of year before she said PERIOD

Im from around Rochester and I dont remember a spring like this in a while freshman Meghan Schubmehl said PERIOD It makes it a little hard to go to class freshman Emilia Nymander added PERIOD

A minor downfall of the otherwise welcome weather was that dorms all over campus were warmed up as a result gradually becoming hot and stuffy PERIOD Its twice as hot in my room as it is outside and I got three fans going said freshman Rawley Heimer PERIOD To deal with the heat I slept with a wet towel for a blanket last night said freshman Alex Dusenbery PERIOD Heimer Dusenbery and other freshmen spent Wednesday evening barbecuing in the Freshman Quad PERIOD

Regardless the weather seems to have boosted the attitude of the student body PERIOD Its a nice way to end a school year after a cruel harsh winter said freshman Ian MacAvoy of the early summer PERIOD
