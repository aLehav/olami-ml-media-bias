Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Colin RemesFebruary  

There are many stereotypes that exist about college parties PERIOD

From town houses to frat houses to apartments there are certain aspects of the college party that will always exist  most notably loud music lots of drinking perhaps other chemical enhancers and usually someone drinking too much then subsequently spending the later night and early morning becoming acquainted with the toilet PERIOD

These things happen but we have fun we recover and we go on with our lives PERIOD There are unfortunately some people who vehemently insist on harshing on everyones buzz PERIOD The most recent example of which was when an employee of my property management company came to my door and explained to me that my music was too loud and requested politely that I turn it down PERIOD

Im not one to kill the messenger and I cordially complied PERIOD What bothers me about this situation is a number of things the first that this complaint occurred around  p.m PERIOD on a weekday PERIOD

Yes my music was up pretty loud but I didnt think it would bother anyone for me to listen to some rock and roll while I did my laundry in the middle of the day PERIOD How wrong I was PERIOD

I can get annoyed with music being played too loudly as well but I also understand that my fellow tenants enjoy their loud music as much as I do PERIOD In fact I would actually like to thank all of those in my building for being respectful to me and the other tenants by not blasting music into all hours of the night and early morning PERIOD As a rule I do not play loud music in my apartment after  p.m PERIOD When living in a college town like DeKalb one should be aware that it is mostly populated by undergraduate students who like to stay up late and party on the weekends PERIOD This is a reality that most of us accept willingly PERIOD

I have never lodged a complaint against my fellow tenants about loud music or for any other reason PERIOD I have had no cause to PERIOD This is my last semester as an undergrad and I would like to enjoy my last few months here without having to worry about whether or not my music is up too loud PERIOD Especially when its daytime PERIOD
