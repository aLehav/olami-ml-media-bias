If you have some time to kill approximately six hours and dont mind your butt getting a little numb the newly released Alexander DVD and its special features are a perfect selection for a marathon of popcorn feasting PERIOD
This Warner Brothers film is the latest on the long list of movies produced and directed by Oliver Stone including JFK  and Any Given Sunday  PERIOD
In Alexander Colin Farrell known both for the movie Phone Booth and a brief fling with Britney Spears plays the legendary Alexander the Great PERIOD Alexanders mother Olympias is played by Angelina Jolie whose work includes Tomb Raider and Hackers PERIOD King Philip Alexanders father is played by a oneeyed Val Kilmer PERIOD Other stars such as Jared Leto and Anthony Hopkins play commanders in Alexanders army PERIOD
The tale of Alexanders life is narrated by one of Alexanders commanders in Egypt after his death PERIOD Much of the beginning of the movie is Alexanders molding into the person he becomes with a little history lesson on the side PERIOD The Greek mythology is also explained via Kilmers character so the audience can see clearer why Greek society feared their gods PERIOD
The movie takes its audience from the formative years of young Alexander through his journey from Macedonia across Asia as a powerful king and military commander PERIOD Alexanders parents were key forces in molding him into a charismatic leader who trounces the entire Persian army and conquers country after country PERIOD The young Alexander strives for his cold fathers approval as his mother teaches him to conquer his fears PERIOD The conniving snaketoting Olympias is played perfectly by Jolie PERIOD Her dark character coincides with Jolies off screen fascinations with darkness PERIOD Young Alexander is also taught geography and Greek Philosophy by Aristotle which also shines through into his conquering days PERIOD
The battle action begins with adult Alexander leading the Greeks and Macedonians against the Persian army who ruled most of the known Eastern world PERIOD In this bloody battle Alexander uses his cavalry to smartly defeat the Persians and jumpstart his venture spanning more than seven years across the Eastern world PERIOD Alexander leads his army right up to the Himalayas and then down into the uncharted jungles of India PERIOD Throughout the journey and the battles that ensue the movie explores flashbacks into Alexanders early years as well as questioning the social norms in the conquered nations PERIOD
The movie has an intense story to tell of bravery sacrifice and betrayal PERIOD It makes sense that it would be such a long one PERIOD The Directors Cut is a whopping  minutes in length PERIOD The DVDs special features are quite lengthy as well PERIOD Theres also a commentary track featuring director Oliver Stone PERIOD This makes for a thorough lesson on every teeny tiny detail of the movie PERIOD Stone tells why scenes were included or cut in the original versus the Directors Cut PERIOD He also puts more insight into the history lessons in the film PERIOD
After watching one lengthy movie the same one with a voiceover is not that enticing especially when the DVD is due back to Blockbuster in two days PERIOD
On Disc  theres an 80minute threepart documentary on the making of the film directed by Stones son PERIOD We also are treated to the usual inclusions such as the theatrical trailer PERIOD Overall this is an excellent rental pick for the action packed film or for a gigantic watcheverythingontheDVD marathon PERIOD
