525,2023-10-23,"when the brackets came out for this years NCAA Tournament the first thing I wanted to know was where the Utes were seeded PERIOD
As soon as I found the Utes seeded No PERIOD  in the Austin regional I immediately wondered how far they would have to make it before the cruel minds of the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee would force another collision with the team that has become Utahs tournament archnemesis Kentucky PERIOD Naturally the game would come sooner rather than later and all the Utes needed to do was survive UTEP in the first round and an overrated Oklahoma squad in the second round and there they were the Kentucky Wildcats waiting to stick the knife in the Utes PERIOD Again PERIOD
We all know the history and it isnt good PERIOD Since  the Utes have played the Wildcats in the NCAA Tournament five times PERIOD Weve lost every time PERIOD Id like to call Kentucky our rival but they arent PERIOD Rivals are twosided not lopsided PERIOD 
In all fairness the Utes have managed some pretty impressive performances but they never can get the job done PERIOD In  the Utes played a solid game before losing to the Wildcats in the Elite Eight Keith Van Horns final game as a Ute and then theres the one U fans are still reeling aboutthe  final PERIOD We were up  at the half PERIOD You know the rest PERIOD Its too painful to talk about PERIOD
Think about it like this Utah is Merrill Cook and Kentucky is whoever his opponent is PERIOD Maybe it will be different this year but thats probably what Cook thinks at the beginning of each election year PERIOD
As a U fan there are two ways to look at the fact that we	 are playing Kentucky again PERIOD The first is that were cursed and that the NCAA Tournament Selection gets some sort of sick entertainment from forcing us to play Kentucky so often PERIOD This viewpoint though likely true is selfdefeating and doesnt get us anywhere except mad at the NCAA PERIOD The second way of looking at it is that at least we keep getting chances for vindication PERIOD Every time the Utes lose to the Wildcats it makes a potential future victory even that much sweeter PERIOD Like this year PERIOD If the Bogutled Utes can snap the losing streak and break the curse then they will be winning not just for themselves but also for every U player that ever had to play their final game against Kentucky PERIOD Andre Miller Michael Doleac and Van Horn among others all come to mind PERIOD 
All bias aside though the Utes really do have a good shot at winning this year PERIOD One of the things experts look for at this time of year is how good a teams conference is PERIOD We already know that the Mountain West Conference sucks but the South Eastern Conference has proven to be pretty pathetic too PERIOD Out of five teams from the SEC to make it into the NCAA Tournament only Kentucky is still left PERIOD Florida after kicking Kentuckys ass twice in the same month were beat in the second round against a weak Villanova squad PERIOD Alabama seeded No PERIOD  was upset in the first round by WisconsinMilwaukee and LSU seeded No PERIOD  lost to AlabamaBirmingham in the first round as well PERIOD Mississippi State beat a terrible Stanford team in the first round but had no chance against Duke in the second round PERIOD That leaves only Kentucky to represent the overrated SEC PERIOD
Another factor often considered by experts in predicting NCAA Tournament success and another reason the Utes could win is to look for the team with the best player PERIOD Andrew Bogut a firstteam AllAmerican selection gets the check mark here PERIOD The best player on Kentuckys teamyouve probably never even heard of himis Chuck Hayes PERIOD He was only an honorable mention AllAmerican and while that might sound like a bad joke his averages of . points and . rebounds are hardly the numbers of an AllAmerican PERIOD Another plus for the Utes is that Hayes is his teams leading rebounder at . rebounds per game PERIOD Not exactly impressive PERIOD The Utes also have experience on their side PERIOD U point guard Marc Jackson already got a good look at some of the same Kentucky players in  and he scored  points in that gameas a sophomore who was only getting limited time PERIOD Now we have Bogut and Kentucky doesnt have any real superstars PERIOD
I might be suffering from the Merrill Cook syndrome again but this year it could really happen PERIOD With all of the other crazy things that have happened in Utah sports this year why not this
