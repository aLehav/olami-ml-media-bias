ECU PD women speak on Safety Gals Facebook group and incidents around Greenville PERIOD

Several East Carolina University students continue to utilize Safety Gals a private Facebook group as a way to share safety tips and provide information for women in Greenville North Carolina about criminal activity on the rise on and off ECUs campus PERIOD

Safety Gals created by graduate student Lisa Khare in August  aims to provide safety tips and information for women in Greenville and female students with over  members and daily posts to make others aware of criminal activity in the area PERIOD

Khare said she created the Safety Gals group after she experienced an incident on her way home from class where a man exposed himself to her from his car PERIOD She said she posted the incident on another Facebook group for ECU women to clean out their closets Pirate Gals BuySellTrade where she received over  comments from other women who experienced similar or identical situations PERIOD

Khare said after she saw comments from women who had experienced the same or similar situations she decided to create Safety Gals as a space for ECU and Greenville women to post instances of threatened safety PERIOD She said she noticed there was a delay in communication between police victims and others who should be made aware of crime which occurs around them PERIOD

I was just like you know we dont get an ECU Alert until the next morning when something happens Khare said PERIOD Im like what can you know from that when youre on the streets where the breakins are happening what is that going to do

Khare said she lived on the Grid a neighborhood where many ECU students reside for two years and she continues to be surprised by the amount of crime present there PERIOD She said she is shocked to see a college campus infiltrated with crime toward women and wants ECU to maintain safety for future students and residents of Greenville PERIOD

Safety Gals was founded as a platform for women to feel safer according to Khare PERIOD She said groups like this should exist for anyone regardless of sex as a place for people to create a flow of information about crime quickly PERIOD

ECU Police Department PD Captain Chris Sutton said he was unaware of the existence of the Facebook group until March  after an interview on campus safety with another staff member from The East Carolinian PERIOD He said he was surprised to hear about the volume of posts from women about recurrent criminal activity on the grid and other offcampus residences PERIOD

In the face of safety theres really not any limits to how creative you can be with trying to develop plans to stay safe and to keep others safe Sutton said PERIOD Social media is certainly an excellent way to share what we ECU PD would call in law enforcement intelligence information about PERIOD I think its a terrific idea. a college town such as Greenville is prone to have predators around it in search of individuals they believe to be weaker than them according to Sutton PERIOD He said although the COVID19 pandemic has alleviated the amount of incidents oncampus it doesnt eliminate the possibility of incidents to increase when students return back to campus PERIOD

Members of Safety Gals are encouraged to reach out to authorities about incidents they have posted about in the group according to Sutton PERIOD He said if there is an instance where multiple people claim the same situation happened to them they should go to the police so they can investigate the claims PERIOD

Sutton said students are encouraged to download the application LiveSafe as a way to communicate with ECU PD about criminal activity PERIOD He said the app allows a user to send text messages and photos to the departments dispatch center where officers can be sent to your location PERIOD

If somebodys at your door you may be weary of calling for fear that he may hear your voice so you can pull your phone out and you can start texting our police department through our dispatch Sutton said PERIOD

Aside from the LiveSafe application Sutton said he recommends females stay aware of what surrounds them not only oncampus but at shopping centers and other highpopulated areas in Greenville PERIOD He said the face mask mandate put in place by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper due to COVID19 gives people an advantage to further disguise themselves and make individuals harder to identify PERIOD

Sutton said ECU PD has citywide jurisdiction in Greenville to be able to respond to any call PERIOD He said many universities police departments dont have this ability so it is a useful asset for ECUs community PERIOD

Sophomore history major Jessica McArthur said she joined Safety Gals because she doesnt hear a lot about criminal activity in the ECU and Greenville communities PERIOD

I would just like to recommend that every woman that goes to ECU or lives in Greenville to join that Safety Gals so theyre aware of stuff thats happening around Greenville McArthur said PERIOD

Shortly after she joined the group she made her first post about an incident of vandalism at her apartment according to McArthur PERIOD She said a group of men had thrown rocks at her window on multiple occasions and broke it which she believes was because her and her roommates had a Black Lives Matter flag in the window PERIOD

The Safety Gals group allows for women to talk about issues around Greenville such as human trafficking according to McArthur PERIOD She said she is not surprised by the posts she sees because of her familiarity with the Greenville area PERIOD

An Administrator of the Safety Gals Facebook group and sophomore marketing major Rachelle Cabrera said the main purpose of Safety Gals is to raise awareness for women in Greenville PERIOD She said those who wish to join the group must be local to Greenville or Pitt County as well as have a Facebook account PERIOD

Im kind of scared to walk around Greenville I never go to Target alone Cabrera said PERIOD Im very like high aware of everything around me and so I just wanted to help keep an eye on that on the app. cabrera said the Facebook group provides safety tips and reminders as well as represents a platform for women to share stories and experiences PERIOD

The discrimination of homeless people on the group is one of the reasons why she became an admin according to Cabrera PERIOD She said some women in the group would take pictures of a mentally ill homeless woman and post them to tell others to watch out for her however the woman depicted online posed no threats to the community PERIOD

A lot of people who are friends with her the homeless woman got offended Cabrera said PERIOD Just because theyre mentally ill doesnt mean theyre not OK PERIOD Were also in their home so thats one thing that surprised me which is why I wanted to join. cabrera said along with the safety benefits of the Safety Gals group women have also been able to find lost items PERIOD She said she would like to see more involvement from more police officers in the community PERIOD

I see a lot of cops everywhere for like cars speeding but I never see enough cops like helping the whole like area with stalking and sexual harassment and a lot of just like innopropriate things going on like in front of women Cabrera said PERIOD I would just like to see more involvement of that. cabrera said her safety tips for women are to carry pepper spray to go places in pairs to look under cars before entrance and to not touch anything you may see on your car like a zip tie or a sticker as it could be a human trafficking tactic PERIOD She said women should help anyone they see who may be in danger and not to shy away from fear PERIOD

Senior criminal justice major Madison Church said the Safety Gals group is one of the most beneficial resources she has had access to while in Greenville PERIOD

Not only does it Safety Gals give us Greenville women a way to kind of keep eachother safe and protected from different things that are going on and keep the community alert to whats going on Church said PERIOD It Safety Gals kind of brings you know a sense of comfort and empowerment knowing that you have other girls you can turn to and the potential to help other people. church said she checks the group everyday so she is updated on what is going on around her PERIOD She does her best to answer questions in the group when she is able to she said as well as bump or engage with other womens posts so they can receive more attention PERIOD

The Safety Gals group allows women to communicate quickly and effectively as members continue to update the group on situations that happen in Greenville according to Church PERIOD She said its important to travel in groups when going out though when alone she has found she feels more comfortable when she has something to defend herself with PERIOD

To make yourself the most comfortable whether its having like pepper spray or a knife just something little so that you can always feel as though you can defend yourself Church said PERIOD I feel like if women felt more confident or felt that they had more resources to just you know feel like theyre capable of defending themselves PERIOD It would definitely be a helpful thing. log In
