The State Botanical Gardens of Georgia will host a native plant sale to aid conservation efforts PERIOD

The State Botanical Garden of Georgia will be holding their annual Bluestems and Bluejeans native plant sale at the Mimsie Lanier Center again this year PERIOD This is an easily accessible opportunity for anyone to come discover and buy plants that are native to Georgia and have been grown right here in Athens PERIOD

The mission is to get native plants into urban gardens everywhere PERIOD Just to work native plants in even if someone has a formal garden display because native plants support wildlife saidJennifer Ceska the Botanical Gardens conservation coordinator PERIOD So we are trying to support Georgias wildlife and get people to incorporate these plants. there will be experts at the event to answer questions and to help anyone pick out and find different native plants PERIOD

Not only is this sale an opportunity to find plants and get a behind the scenes look into the growing of these Georgia species but there will also be activities for children such as gourd panting PERIOD The event is aimed at all age groups PERIOD

When on the subject of why people should visit and buy plants from gardens or events such as this one instead of a generic store Ceska often feels a great deal of passion PERIOD

They must come here for several reasons PERIOD Well one everything we sell goes to conservation its our conservation budget PERIOD Also we do not use insecticides or herbicides on our plants that we sell so when youre putting them into your garden these plants will support butterflies and native bees PERIOD They wont hurt them said Ceska PERIOD A lot of box stores have the neonicotinoid the nicotine based insecticides and its systematic in the plant so if the insect works the plant it will die PERIOD So if its a monarch butterfly the insect will die. the Botanical Garden has been successful with the plant sale in the past they are now on their third year of this annual event PERIOD The staff has been preparing for a year and have over  different native plant species which have all been raised at the Mimsie Lanier Center that will be for sale PERIOD

Some of the different species of plants will include trees shrubs perennials vines and grasses PERIOD

Georgia has many beautiful plants that need to be preserved and that is exactly what the conservation efforts at the Botanical Gardens in Athens are meant to do PERIOD

There are three main reasons for Georgia plant conservation said Connie Cottingham who has been working with the Botanical Gardens for  years PERIOD To protect Georgias natural plant spcies to help the native insects and animals that feed best off of Gerogias plants and because we are Georgia we dont need California poppies when we have plants that are native here that are beautiful. what Bluestems and Bluejeans Native Plant Sale
