1836,2008-05-07,"i walked the labyrinth mindfully pausing at each step to consider the worn out loafers and tiny Converse sneakers that marked my path PERIOD 
Tuesdays display of civilians shoes arranged into a labyrinth on the Alameda Mall at first struck me as an oddity PERIOD Adjacent to the militaristicallyneat lines of soldiers boots which represented those who have died in the Iraq War the civilian shoes looked out of place PERIOD 
But that is the point PERIOD The deaths of so many innocents should indeed seem out of place especially on our greenpreened safetybubbled Hollywoodlandish campus PERIOD 
Its a weighty reminder for preoccupied college students just trying to get through midterms PERIOD What can we who are drowning in essays internship hunting and housing decisions possibly do We can pay attention PERIOD
It wasnt until I stepped up to the labyrinth that I could decipher its structure PERIOD Thats how it often is with me PERIOD While sprinting through my tunnelvisioned daily routine its not until I am called to stop for a moment by something like this display that I actually realize where and who I am PERIOD During these carefullyscheduled four years we are all too willing to exchange our true identities for attractive resumes and Facebook profiles PERIOD
The term  has recently been buzzing around campus PERIOD Based in the Buddhist tradition being mindful means being attentive to every task PERIOD This means contemplating everything from the origin of my daily bowl of Cheerios to the way I react to an unexpected test grade PERIOD It is not until we are aware of our actions and thoughts that we can then begin to add fullness to our lives PERIOD If only I had time to be mindful PERIOD
Unexpected events like the shoe display encourage us to be mindful taking those ohsoimportant few minutes of our selfabsorbed days to make us aware of the chaos that otherwise eludes us PERIOD
To be young  philosophers of thought parasites of an expensive education and on the verge of success   is golden PERIOD
The endless difficulties that rule my life suddenly become frivolous in the face of truth I am one of the few PERIOD The few luckiest to live in a place where I can voice my opinion without dire consequences worry about things such as midterms and gaze upon the tragedy of another society from the reassuring protection of my own PERIOD
Leave that useless baggage behind PERIOD Be mindful of the moment that is your life in context of the disappointment that defines others PERIOD 
No unexpected test grade internship rejection or failed spring fling should inhibit our gratitude for opportunity PERIOD
And when that gratitude is wrung be mindful of the bitterness and think of the labyrinth PERIOD In this walk of life the civilians shoes could be our own  but to walk between them is to be free PERIOD
