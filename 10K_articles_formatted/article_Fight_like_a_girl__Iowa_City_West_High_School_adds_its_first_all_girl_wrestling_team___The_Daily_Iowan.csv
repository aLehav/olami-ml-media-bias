Iowa City West semifinalist Mami Selemani wrestles with an opponent during The  Iowa Wrestling Coaches and Officials Association Girls State Wrestling tournament at WaverlyShell Rock High School on Saturday Jan PERIOD   PERIOD Iowa City West High School competed in their first state tournament and had two girls place in the semifinals PERIOD

Kelsey Harrell News Reporter January  

In middle school Laurel Haverkamp would square up eyetoeye with her opponent  who was almost always a boy PERIOD Due to this she dropped the sport she loved before starting high school opting instead to manage the boys wrestling team PERIOD She says now that she felt matches between a boy and girl would sometimes create a disadvantage in size or aggressiveness for her proving to be too intense PERIOD

But this decision was reversed this year her senior year of high school as Iowa City West High School sent an allfemale team to compete at allgirl wrestling tournaments for the first time ever PERIOD

The new West High team was created as the number of girls participating in wrestling statewide more than doubled this year PERIOD To cap off Haverkamps first season wrestling competitively since middle school she faced off against three other girls during Iowas secondannual allgirls weekend tournament Jan PERIOD  twoandahalf hours away in Waverly Iowa PERIOD

She walked away from the meet without clearing to the semifinals but said that feeling the swell of support from parents and friends for her one and only year of highschool wrestling was still a high note to end her highschool career PERIOD

The environment has been insane the community is really rallying around all their girls and just walking through these back hallways its hard to walk back here and not see a coach either hyping up or calming down one of their girls Haverkamp said PERIOD Overall it just feels like almost exactly like any other boys wrestling meet you would go to. across the state more girls are venturing into the typically maledominated sport of wrestling PERIOD West High is now one of  schools in Iowa that have allgirls teams with members numbering into the double digits said Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union Executive Director Jean Berger PERIOD Most schools have two to five girls integrated into a boys wrestling team PERIOD

This year  highschool girls participated in wrestling on a boys team in Iowa more than two times the  highschool girls who competed in the sport during the  academic year PERIOD

Advocates are working to harness that added interest and set up allgirls meets and matchups sanctioned by the Iowa High School Girls Athletic Union PERIOD

Nationally since  the number of highschool girls who wrestle has increased from  to  as of  according to data from the National Wrestling Coaches Association PERIOD A sanctioned official scholastic state championship is held for girls wrestling in  states PERIOD

Growing up with a family full of wrestlers meant that West High sophomore Ava Davis spent many long days at wrestling tournaments watching her brothers compete PERIOD Although she always wanted to try the sport she seldom saw girls get the chance PERIOD

I know theres a boys basketball team girls basketball team girls swimming and boys swimming and Im so happy now theyre doing girls wrestling and boys wrestling because I think its a great opportunity for all the girls to get in and just show them what they can do Davis said PERIOD

Before joining the team Davis didnt know much wrestling terminology beyond pinning an opponent or taking down someone PERIOD Shes since learned new techniques and said that shes discovered there is so much still to learn about the sport PERIOD

The team started practices in December  and was set to have five tournaments this season but two were canceled due to weather PERIOD

West High teacher Kody Pudil held an informational meeting before the start of the season to gauge the girls interest in wrestling PERIOD To Pudils surprise around  girls attended the meeting and  showed up to the first  a.m PERIOD practice PERIOD

He asked Justin Koethe a former wrestler and boys wrestling coach to coach the team  his first venture into training a female team PERIOD When offered the position he saw it as an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the sport hes participated in all his life Koethe said PERIOD

When he was a wrestler Koethe said no girls competed PERIOD As girls interest in the sport grew the only outlet for them to participate was on a boys team PERIOD

Having allgirls teams in wrestling allows the athletes to have more fun and truly compete to be the best they can be Koethe said PERIOD The new team allows the girls to be more comfortable and wrestle people who are closer to their size and build he added PERIOD

I really would like to see it become a legitimized sport Koethe said PERIOD Right now its not technically a schoolsanctioned sport its more of like a club thing PERIOD So within the next couple of years I would definitely love to see it become a sanctioned sport. in order to make girls wrestling a sanctioned sport the Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union needs  percent around  schools to request sanctioning Berger said PERIOD Currently  schools have put in requests and  are in the exploratory stages of creating programs she added PERIOD

There are a lot of schools monitoring it and looking at it and want to make sure that at least for their girls their school is ready she said PERIOD

The number of girls participating jumped this academic because the girls now have the opportunity to wrestle other girls Berger said PERIOD There are  girlsonly wrestling meets in Iowa giving girls the chance to compete without boys she said PERIOD

To finish out their season the West High team participated in the girls state wrestling tournament at WaverlyShell Rock High School PERIOD Although it was only its third tournament this season the team placed fifth overall with one of its wrestlers Mami Selemoni placing second in her weight class and another Salima Omari securing a state title in hers PERIOD

Despite only competing in two allgirl tournaments before state the girls exceeded Koethes expectations PERIOD By the time semifinals and finals rolled around Koethe said he didnt care what their team score was but just wanted to see the girls keep winning their matches and bring home some hardware PERIOD

To Koethe and the girls who enjoyed their time working together the season wasnt long enough PERIOD In the coming year Koethe hopes take the team to  dual meets and tournaments to give them more opportunities to compete and improve throughout their season PERIOD

The changes Ive seen in the girls throughout the season is incredible Koethe said PERIOD Theyve built confidence in all aspects of their lives. looking at the team from the beginning of the season to now Koethe said they look like a completely different group of girls PERIOD One girl would barely touch her opponent at the start of the season he recalled PERIOD Now after two months of practice referees at the state tournament reprimanded her for being too rough PERIOD

Haverkamp was excited to see how much progress she and her teammates made since state would be their first tournament since December  PERIOD At the last two tournaments the girls cheered each other on during each match and Haverkamp said she was looking forward to seeing everyone come together like that again PERIOD

Haverkamp watched her sister serve as a manager on a boys wrestling team which initially sparked her interest in participating in the sport PERIOD She wrestled on the boys team in seventh and eighth grades before breaking her hand PERIOD

She decided not to continue wrestling into high school saying matches against boys can become much too intense since boys tend to get more aggressive PERIOD Instead she chose to become a manager for the boys team until she decided to wrestle alongside the girls this year PERIOD

Within the first week of practice the girls became fast friends forging immediate bonds and growing more comfortable around each other as time went on PERIOD The team starts practices by goofing around and laughing with each other during warmups PERIOD As they start jogging and stretching Haverkamp said the group quiets down and gets in the zone. not only is wrestling a sport that everyone should get the opportunity to try but its one of those things where girls kind of can get put in a box of like not being tough or kind of being the weaker gender Haverkamp said PERIOD I think the fact that we have a girls wrestling team goes against all that. after noticing a push across the state from other schools to bring girls wrestling to the high school level Pudil asked the schools athletic director how that could be a reality PERIOD He then conducted a survey at the school last spring to see how many girls would be interested PERIOD

The fairly high turnout to informational meetings spurred Pudil and school administrators to begin discussing whether the school would fund the program and logistics he said PERIOD

The school and the Iowa City Community School District as a whole have both supported and helped in the process of developing and looking for funding of the program Pudil said PERIOD During the initial survey conducted Pudil said he received praise from other teachers who hoped he would be able to make the team a reality PERIOD

This obviously shows that especially a school our size that there are a lot of female athletes out there that want to participate and want to try out something new Pudil said PERIOD Hopefully something like this inspires other schools to take a risk with it and see how many girls are interested. although the other high schools in Iowa City dont have allgirls wrestling teams they are able to join West Highs team to have the opportunity to compete with other girls Pudil said PERIOD

West High sophomore Mattie Harms heard about the informational meeting from a friend before going to practices and giving the sport a try PERIOD Harms ran cross country and played soccer she said but had never wrestled PERIOD

Harms sees the team as a way to give girls the opportunity to try out a sport they might be interested in PERIOD

I hope that we can keep the team going next year and for many years to come she said PERIOD Hopefully girls wrestling will become a statewide thing that every high school can have as an opportunity for the girls. luke Eustice who works in sports development at Think Iowa City volunteers as a coach for the team and hopes to help the sport grow through creating local competition for it PERIOD

Eustice said he and his colleagues prioritize laying down the infrastructure for a girls wrestling program such as planning and putting on allgirls events to make forming a girls wrestling team a viable and practical option for schools PERIOD

He added he hopes these matchups and tournaments showcase interest girls have in the sport eventually showing administrators at the Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union that forming an official girls program statewide is a worthwhile venture PERIOD

The girls are very proud of being the first girls wrestling program at West Eustice said PERIOD I know that just from talking to them that they take a lot of pride in that. after watching her brother Ashton wrestle when he was younger West High sophomore Emma Barker wanted to give the sport a try PERIOD She wrestled on the boys team last year before joining the girls team this winter PERIOD

Her brother has been a big supporter of hers since the beginning Barker said PERIOD

Its just all because of Ashton you know I started it with him she said PERIOD He pushed me into it he started doing it to get better at it hes always there for me. barker was injured during the meet and thus unable to continue competing PERIOD An injury Koethe felt could have been prevented if the referees would have stopped the girls from continuing the match PERIOD

Something the girls can agree upon is that they want to see the wrestling program continue to grow and improve in the years to come PERIOD

Ive only heard of it in Iowa really and I hope it gets popular in other states and starts to bring it up and everybody starts talking about it Davis said PERIOD I just hope that its not something little I hope when people talk about the boys state tournament they also talk about the girls state tournament like it means something to them. read Next
