2757,2011-01-14,"coming into the season I decided anything around a . record would be about par for the mens hockey team PERIOD The Badgers lost four 50point scorers seven seniors and four very talented underclassmen who bolted for the pros PERIOD

After watching a highflying offense rip off four goals per game in  this season looked like it would be a return to the norm for Wisconsin Get solid goaltending and hope to score just one more than the opponent PERIOD

It was supposed to be a rebuilding year a season in which the young talent would gain some experience and not much else PERIOD

Apparently Mike Eaves crew didnt get the memo PERIOD

Wisconsin sits at  right now and went on a sevengame winning streak between December and January PERIOD The Badgers score . goals per game twelfth in the nation while allowing just . fourth PERIOD They sit at fourth in scoring margin with a . mark which is notable because last seasons top four in that category also happened to be comprised of the teams that played in the Frozen Four PERIOD

Most of the Badgers tough games are behind them A split with MinnesotaDuluth this past weekend marked one of just two  series that loomed for UW the other being a trip to NebraskaOmaha PERIOD

Wisconsin sits in a similar position as it was last season but with a very dissimilar group of players PERIOD The Badgers as of now would make the NCAA tournament likely as a No PERIOD  seed PERIOD

The question still remains though With  regularseason games left can these guys actually make a run

The good

As mentioned before the Badgers on average outscore their opponents by a goal and a half PERIOD In all games played theyve scored the most goals of any WCHA team and allowed the fewest PERIOD The conferences best teams North Dakota Denver and MinnesotaDuluth are in the rearview mirror PERIOD

Part of that is the continued excellence of Wisconsins defensemen PERIOD UWs top pair of junior Jake Gardiner and sophomore Justin Schultz are plus18 and plus12 respectively PERIOD They also rank first and fourth in the nation respectively in blue line scoring PERIOD With  goals and  assists Schultz leads all defensemen in goals and total points PERIOD

Meanwhile veterans Eric Springer and Craig Johnson have been steady while sophomore John Ramage continues to get better PERIOD Freshmen Frankie Simonelli and Joe Faust have proven themselves reliable PERIOD

Up front sophomore Craig Smith has already gone  on pace to shatter his  mark from last season PERIOD Freshman Mark Zengerle  and junior Jordy Murray  have joined Smith to form a formidable top line PERIOD

Most impressive might be the play of senior Scott Gudmandson who has improved his numbers from last season despite playing with a less talented and less experienced group in front of him PERIOD Gudmandsons . goalsagainst average and . save percentage both lead the WCHA PERIOD

Gudmandson has shown the ability to stand on his head in big games and was the only reason a  November loss to North Dakota wasnt a  loss PERIOD

And while the Badgers may be young they have begun to show maturity digging out of a few recent early deficits PERIOD Maybe more importantly was UWs first overtime win since March of  in a  victory over Canisius two weeks ago PERIOD Wisconsin had been  in overtime until that win PERIOD

While UW can be criticized for allowing Canisius to turn a  deficit into a  lead the Badgers never panicked and showed toughness in finishing the game out the kind of experience that will only help in the future PERIOD

The bad

While Wisconsins overall record is solid the Badgers are just  in league play and tied for fifth place PERIOD

The main knock on the Badgers is the disparity in their performance against good teams and bad teams PERIOD UW is just  against UND UMD and DU the top teams in the conference PERIOD The majority of Wisconsins wins have come against the Holy Crosses and AlabamaHuntsvilles of the world PERIOD

Another item of concern is the Badgers topheavy distribution of scoring PERIOD UWs top line and top defensive pair  Smith Murray Zengerle Schultz and Gardiner also Wisconsins top powerplay unit  have accounted for  of UWs  goals and  of  total points PERIOD

UWs second line of Michael Mersch Podge Turnbull and Tyler Barnes are a combined  PERIOD Beyond the aforementioned eight players the Badgers get contributions here and there from the rest of the players PERIOD

A final worry Wisconsin still scores about  percent of its goals on the power play PERIOD Thirtyfive of  UW goals have come with the manadvantage PERIOD For comparison last years group scored only about  percent of its total goals on the power play PERIOD

Executing with the manadvantage is great PERIOD Relying on the power play to provide offense is a much less sustainable model of success PERIOD

The verdict

Wisconsin has a very manageable finish to its regular season PERIOD Its remaining opponents Minnesota State Michigan Tech NebraskaOmaha Minnesota St PERIOD Cloud State and Colorado College are a combined  with half of the games coming at the Kohl Center PERIOD

Should UW take care of business as expected it could grab home ice for the first round of the WCHA playoffs and get to the Final Five PERIOD North Dakota is by far the favorite to win the conference but the Badgers should get an atlarge bid to the tournament and win a game PERIOD Dont expect a repeat of last season but dont completely close the door on the possibility either PERIOD

Adam is a senior majoring in journalism PERIOD How far can these young Badgers go Email him at emailprotected or Tweet AdamJSHolt PERIOD
