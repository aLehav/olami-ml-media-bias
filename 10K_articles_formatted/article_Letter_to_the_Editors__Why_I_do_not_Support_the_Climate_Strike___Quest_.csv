Letter do not necessarily reflect the views of the Quest or the Editorial Board

Let me first brandish my credentials I am a cardcarrying Democratic Socialist and member of Greenpeace PERIOD I am queer disabled and Jewish PERIOD I am also of the opinion that we should transition as quickly as possible away from hyperconsumerist capitalism toward a more sustainable equitable and just green socialism PERIOD Knowing this information alone it ought to be fairly easy to predict that I will support the climate strike PERIOD And in a sense I do I think the strike is a fantastic idea and believe that students ought as much as possible to participate in it PERIOD I believe climate justice is imperative and that activism is an important practical measure that can be employed to achieve it PERIOD

Yet despite all this when I was standing in the library being cajoled to sign a petition to shut down Reed College I hesitated and informed the enthusiastic climate activist that I needed some time to think it over PERIOD I did that and upon engaging in some reflection I decided that it would be institutionally damaging for Reed to participate in this climate strike primarily because it would violate core principles of political neutrality PERIOD

Let me briefly outline just what the activists behind the climate strike want PERIOD They desire to at the very least have Reed professors forced to not mark students absent if they participate in the climate strike PERIOD More ambitiously they believe that Reed should shut down its entire operations on the day of the strike and in effect declare solidarity with the goals of the strikers PERIOD

When I say that I am opposed to the climate strike I typically get a couple responses PERIOD People tell me that climate change is not political  it is an indubitable scientific fact PERIOD In a sense this is true PERIOD Climate change has been decisively established by the empirical sciences PERIOD Yet there is a gap between recognizing a fact and deciding how to respond to it PERIOD If you navigate to the global climate strike page you will see that they demand a rapid transition away from fossil fuels reparations equity and climate justice PERIOD The first two items on this list are manifestly political demands PERIOD One can consistently believe in climate change and also think that the idea of climate reparations if fundamentally wrongheaded PERIOD Similarly one might think that climate change is real and a threat but also desire a more moderate transition away from fossil fuels PERIOD Lastly note the demand for climate justice  this has a hyperlink and when one clicks on it youre directed toward a website that has an extensive set of demands including a call to transition away from nuclear megahydro and biofuels toward clean safe energy systems and a demand to facilitate and support nonmarket approaches to climate change PERIOD I support both of these demands but I think it requires a sort of intellectual dishonesty to pretend that they are not manifestly political demands PERIOD There are after all those on the right center and the left who believe that nuclear energy and market mechanisms have a place in combating climate change PERIOD

Of course at this point the beleaguered activist might claim that it is simply a fact that we ought to follow these demands and that facts are not after all political PERIOD Yet consider an analogous case a rightwing activist asserts blithely that it is simply a fact that free trade tends to work to increase the GDP of all the countries involved and that this has been confirmed by years of neoclassical economics PERIOD By advocating for free trade they are not making a political demand at all  they are merely stating a fact PERIOD Surely there is something disingenuous going on here PERIOD

Therefore lets grant that Ive established that the climate strike is manifestly political and that Reed by shutting down its campus in response to the climate strike would be essentially endorsing a particular set of political demands and positions PERIOD Some people will think theres nothing wrong with this PERIOD Reed should as an institution endorse the correct political programs and them doing so can hardly be cause for objection PERIOD

Yet this position seems to violate Reeds core principles PERIOD Reed notes in its page on the operating principles of the college that it aims to  promote the freest exchange and most open discussion of ideas and  that it fosters and defends academic freedom by not taking positions on political issues that do not directly affect the fulfillment of its educational mission PERIOD Now I take these two points to be intimately connected PERIOD If Reed as an institution were to unqualifiedly endorse specific political positions they would in effect be sending a message to students who dont hold those positions that they are not welcome within Reeds intellectual community PERIOD If Reed were to overtly declare itself to be an institution dedicated to say democratic socialism it would presumably be necessary to do what it could do promote the principles of democratic socialism  and this might mean infringing upon the speechrights of those who arent democratic socialists and ensuring that democratic socialism is advanced in and outside the classroom PERIOD Surely this would have disastrous consequences for academic freedom and hence for Reeds commitment to be a place where the freest exchange of ideas is possible PERIOD

I do not believe that by declaring solidarity with a particular partisan approach to Climate Change Reed would be doing anything so drastic as endorsing democratic socialism PERIOD But I believe that the basic logic is the same insofar as it would be a dangerous violation of political neutrality PERIOD Reed should therefore not bend to the demands of the climate activists and remain steadfast in its refusal to identify itself institutionally with any single political ideology PERIOD",Letter to the Editors: Why I do not Support the Climate Strike â€“ Quest.,Reed College
