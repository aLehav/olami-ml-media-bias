WARNING This review contains spoilers for 

Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things PERIOD And no good thing ever dies. years ago an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption hit the big screen to decidedly mixed results PERIOD Despite overall positive critical reception a confusing title and a director without much of a reputation led to disastrous box office results and an overall boxoffice bomb of a film PERIOD

However seven Academy Award nominations record VHS sales in  and a passionate and dedicated cult following later  has risen from its early box office ashes to become one of the most dearlybeloved and criticallyheraldedfilms of all time and a testament to the power of home video and movies on television PERIOD

It also serves as a brutally real portrayal of life in prison a hauntingly melancholic story of a man convicted for a crime he did not commit and a beautifully hopeful example of human spirit and determination PERIOD The story of Andy Dufresne is one of distrust growth sadness rebellion and most of all hope PERIOD

The story is relatively simple PERIOD Banker Andy Dufresne portrayed by Tim Robbins in a performance that is somehow quietly explosive in both its emotion and lack thereof has been tried and found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover PERIOD He is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary for a life sentence PERIOD There he meets Ellis Red Redding in what might be the defining performance of Morgan Freemans career and develops a dear friendship all while plotting his eventual escape from the walls of Shawshank PERIOD

This simplistic plot gives way to a beautiful exploration of human spirit as Andy Dufresne is put through the ringer PERIOD He is physically abused forced into solitude raped and yet somehow keeps the same ferocity and sarcastic edge he arrived with rising up in the ranks of the prisoners to be a sort of leader PERIOD The tenacity and stubbornness of the human spirit has never been more beautifully portrayed PERIOD

On the other side of the coin however is the proof of how horrible human nature can be as Bob Guntons Warden Samuel Norton and Clancy Browns Captain Bryon Hadley bring forth a sense of coldblooded and ironfisted tyranny to the screen PERIOD

The relationship that develops between Dufresne and Red is what really sets this film apart from all others PERIOD The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is undeniably engaging and theres a sort of sad understanding that prevails throughout the film between the two of them as they grow together and learn from each others thoughts and actions PERIOD Strangers become friends PERIOD Friends become brothers PERIOD

On a technical level is a film often imitated but never replicated from Darabonts surehanded direction and naturalistic hopeful script to the beautiful and perfectly captured cinematography of Roger Deakins to Thomas Newmans simultaneously haunting and hopeful score. each frame is dripping with equal parts of claustrophobia and freedom oppression and hope PERIOD

The walls of Shawshank seem to close in on the inmates and bring an undeniable sense of dread so familiar to fans of Stephen King yet they also feel like home PERIOD It comes to a point where the concept of freedom is almost terrifying to the prisoners yet it remains so enticing and mandatory to Dufresne PERIOD His character almost personifies the concept of hope and the film benefits dearly from it PERIOD

It is this sense of hope that truly defines the film PERIOD I first saw during a rather tumultuous move as my family relocated from Florida to Virginia PERIOD I had to leave behind some of the best friends I had ever made a home that I truly loved and a sense of identity I had developed during the four years my family had lived in Virginia PERIOD Moving absolutely tore me apart and there were points where hope seemed like a pipe dream PERIOD

I on a whim watched when we first arrived in Virginia and found myself in tears PERIOD Whether it be Andys heartbreaking arrival or his desperate attempt to acquire Bohemianstyle beer for his fellow prisoners or his eventual escape through miles of sewage pipes the message of hope that prevailed through  years of imprisonment inspired me beyond all belief and still keeps me moving forward to this day PERIOD

Just like its central character seemed dead on arrival and received little to no attention upon release PERIOD However a quarter century later hope prevailed and the film stands tall as one of the greatest cinematic achievements the world has ever seen PERIOD Get busy livin or get busy dyin. this film lives on and will continue to be busy livin in the halls of cinematic glory PERIOD
