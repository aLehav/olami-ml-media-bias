I want to commend you on the thoughtful summary your editorial board made in regard to the meeting with UC President Yudof and the current economic crisis of the UC system PERIOD With the misinformation and political gesturing surrounding the California budget and public universities it is important for students to understand the rockandahardplace spot that we are all in right now PERIOD

UCSD is at a tipping point in its history as one of the finest research institutions in the country and arguably the world PERIOD How do we maintain the highest quality of education without the budget to back it In the past when money and resources were available we were able to attract top faculty staff and administration to the campus PERIOD The resulting excellence of information coming from UCSD does more than collect accolades it actually increases the value of your degree PERIOD

Each student who comes to UCSD chooses to come here in order to best set themselves up for their future PERIOD They want to graduate with this universitys name on their degree and resume because they believe the opportunities here will translate to a high paycheck down the road PERIOD Its a simple business return The greater the reputation of your university the greater the return you will get on your investment in your education PERIOD

For whatever misconceptions are out there about how much money UC campuses do or dont have or how it is or isnt spent the reality is this The amount of money you pay for your education barely dents the amount of what it costs to bring you to this campus in a building with a desk and a teacher before you PERIOD The state of California pitches in some money but  percent less than it did  years ago and the rest has to come from creative funding PERIOD How The Student Foundation has your answer Day Tuition Ends will be featured on Library Walk during the Chancellors 5K Challenge on Oct PERIOD  and will tell you exactly how far your dollar is stretched in your education PERIOD Trust me its not as far as you think PERIOD

With the proposed fee increases you are being asked to invest more in your education than ever before PERIOD Maintain the value of your investment by taking the Chancellors Challenge and becoming an IPledge donor to give directly to student scholarships PERIOD Or put your mouth where your money is and let California know exactly how you have been impacted by budget cuts with three simple clicks at advocacy.ucsd.edu PERIOD

As an alumnus and UCSD staff member I sympathize with students facing financial hardship from the proposed fee increases PERIOD Due to budget cuts Ive seen topofthefield faculty recruitments pulled off the table my pay decrease by nearly  percent and colleagues laid off PERIOD But I believe access to higher education is the future for a successful California and I will keep pushing until every student who wants to be here gets the resources they need to succeed PERIOD Come join the fight PERIOD
