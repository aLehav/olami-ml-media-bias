The postDallas Moore era may still be months away but its never too early to analyze the returning players PERIOD

The Ospreys will be losing three pivotal seniors in Aaron Bodager Chris Davenport and Moore and starting guard Garrett Sams will be transferring next season to the University of Tennessee at Martin PERIOD Two starters return PERIOD The Osprey backcourt will be relatively inexperienced but they have a lot of potential PERIOD

Overall the Ospreys wont be as deep as past seasons PERIOD The team is also undersized and guard heavy PERIOD In order to win the team will probably have to play faster and spread the floor PERIOD Theyll probably play with four guards and either a forward or center during many games to compensate for their lack of size PERIOD

Heres the Spinnakers projected starting five for the  basketball season PERIOD

Romelo BanksCenter 

. pPG  RPG . bPG

The fifthyear senior is definitely a force in the paint PERIOD Banks will bring much needed wisdom and experience to the Ospreys PERIOD Last season Banks didnt play very aggressive this could be due to the fact that he was returning after missing a season due to an ankle injury PERIOD If Banks plays to his full potential he could average a doubledouble this season PERIOD

Wajid Aminu Power Forward 

. pPG . rPG . fGP

This is definitely going to become Aminus team PERIOD The reigning ASUN Freshman of the Year had five doubledoubles during his debut season PERIOD Aminu is a bit short for his position and he needs to bulk up a little more PERIOD Once he does that hell be almost unstoppable PERIOD

Osborn Blount Point Guard 

. mPG . fTP . pPG . fGP

Blount plays with no fear and isnt afraid to drive into the paint or pullup for a quick three PERIOD One down side to Blount is hes undersized so some players may be able to take advantage of that PERIOD

CJ Fisher Shooting Guard 

. mPG . fGP . fTP

Fisher has excellent ball handling and hes probably one of the fastest on the team if not the fastest PERIOD The one thing he lacks is experience at the college level PERIOD But Fisher has been practicing with the team for two years so hopefully it pays off PERIOD

Aaron Horne Small Forward 

MPG . . pPG . fTP

Horne has the potential to be a versatile player at UNF PERIOD Florida Hoops Report named him the top small forward FSCAA according to UNF PERIOD At the junior college level he averaged  points and five rebounds before becoming an Osprey PERIOD Horne just lacks division one experience PERIOD

Two of the players listed in this starting five arent even on the team anymore PERIOD The author clearly doesnt pay attention to the happening of the team PERIOD Ozzie wont start J.T PERIOD will PERIOD Ozzie will have the same role he had this year PERIOD A good sub PERIOD Emmanuel Lambright and either Wes Morgan or Ryan Burkhardt whoever plays better defense will start PERIOD With potentially  new players the team will be inexperienced but we saw Garrett and Wajid mature quickly last year PERIOD Hopefully we see the same thing this year PERIOD",A glimpse at the Ospreyâ€™s potential starting five - UNF Spinnaker,University of North Florida
