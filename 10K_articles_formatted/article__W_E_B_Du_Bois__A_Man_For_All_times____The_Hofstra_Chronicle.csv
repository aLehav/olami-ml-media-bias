On Sunday Sept PERIOD  Pulse Ensemble Theatre showcased W.E.B PERIOD Du Bois A Man For All Times featuring Brian Richardson as Du Bois PERIOD Produced by artistic director Alexa Kelly the oneman play followed Du Bois through his early years from his birth in the town of Great Barrington Massachusetts to his eventual decline and death in Accra Ghana PERIOD In between the story showcased Du Bois personal philosophy and often horrific confrontations with racism in the late nineteenth century highlighting his lifelong battle for civil rights PERIOD Du Bois is remembered as one of historys most important black leaders PERIOD As Dr PERIOD Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD said History cannot ignore W.E.B PERIOD Du Bois. i was glad I went to this event said Catie Yanchak a junior dual major in journalism and classical studies PERIOD I learned about him in high school but it was really interesting to learn about this history in the form of a play it was very powerful. the play began in  with Du Bois in shackles PERIOD He had been indicted during the McCarthy era and stood trial for suspected Communist ties PERIOD The scene dissolved into a passionate diatribe from Du Bois on the foundations of American freedom PERIOD Escalating towards the speechs end the historic figure raised his arms to unravel his chains and proclaimed Wake up America Your liberties are being stolen before your very eyes PERIOD Wake up Americans and dare to think and say and do PERIOD Dare to cry no more war

From there the play transitioned back to  when Du Bois was born PERIOD The young Du Bois shared his ancestors racially mixed genealogy and the relative racial harmony in which he grew up PERIOD This harmony contrasted sharply with his experience as a student in the south PERIOD At Fisk University I discovered that the world was split in two halves PERIOD Black and white PERIOD I pained to describe this forced distinction as the color line or the veil PERIOD A new loyalty replaced my Americanism PERIOD Henceforth I would always be regarded and know myself as a Negro. on this split Du Bois remarked It is a peculiar sensation this double consciousness PERIOD This sense of always looking at oneself through the eyes of others PERIOD Of measuring ones soul by the tape of a world that looks on with amused contempt and pity. these disruptions to prior conceptions were featured prevalently throughout the play as Du Bois encountered the horrors of racist practices PERIOD The loss of innocence is jarringly revealed in multiple instances once when he witnessed the mutilation of a pregnant woman and later when he saw the knees of a lynching victim on a butchers window display amidst other animal remains PERIOD

This latter instance triggered Du Bois transition from academia to political activism PERIOD Stepping away from his Ivory Tower Du Bois began his lifelong struggle against racial bias or what he called the shadow of the veil. on activism Du Bois said If one is an activist and not considered dangerous by the powers than one is not doing ones job. clarifying he remarked I do not believe in violent revolution PERIOD I expect revolutionary change mainly to come through reason human sympathy and the education of children PERIOD Not by murder. it was a really moving performance that kind of really interestingly covered W.E.B PERIOD Du Bois life said Ashanti Davis a junior dual major in English and computer science PERIOD It was moving PERIOD It was a good show. in a discussion following the play Assistant Dean Lauren Kozol of the Hofstra University Honors College said It really drives home how hard life was for African Americans at the time that death somehow seems an escape a positive escape as a young person that you dont have to go through all these different stages of life. the plays conclusion highlights a litany of causes promoted by Du Bois among them the abolition of poverty free universal medical care free universal education and freedom of religion PERIOD Still the civil rights activist emphasized that to a large extent My homeland knows me not. connor Imhoff a sophomore theater major said I thought it was a really lection cycle PERIOD I think a lot of the points were a part of Dr PERIOD Du Bois ideals and felt very valid and important. in the current strained status of American race relations and the upcoming presidential election the political activism of Du Bois holds greater importance than ever PERIOD Despite the racial advancements during and after Du Bois time the play still reminded the audience that Sometimes people can only hear your color. please note that only current Hofstra students can become part of our staff writing team PERIOD
