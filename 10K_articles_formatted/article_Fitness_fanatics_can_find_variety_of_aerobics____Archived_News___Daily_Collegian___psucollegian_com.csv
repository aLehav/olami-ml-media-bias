Six years ago State College resident JoAnn Lew quit running when she began to suffer back problems PERIOD

When the opportunity to join a twoforone aerobics class with her daughter arose that year she took it and stuck to it PERIOD With that she joined the new wave of exercise enthusiasts trying out aerobics PERIOD

Aerobics arose about  years ago and it is still gaining popularity PERIOD Student participation in the Universitys aerobics program doubled during the last three years said Patty Kenny fitness coordinator for University recreational sports PERIOD

Last year  students participated in aerobics classes she said adding that during the  school year only  students attended aerobics classes PERIOD

Heartwork Cardiovascular Fitness Center  W PERIOD College Ave. offers  aerobics classes now up from  when it opened two years ago said Jill DiMarcello owneroperator and instructor at Heartwork PERIOD

Along with an increase in participation has come more types of aerobics PERIOD New variations which include lowimpact combo and highimpact can often cause confusion for someone new to the aerobics scene PERIOD

In lowimpact aerobics both feet never leave the ground at the same time therefore there is a decrease in the amount of impact on the body DiMarcello said PERIOD She added however that heartrate and training effects are equivalent to highimpact aerobics PERIOD An example of lowimpact aerobics is marching in place PERIOD

In highimpact aerobics the full body weight hits the floor with an impact six times the bodys actual weight she said PERIOD Movements in highimpact aerobics include jumping jacks jogging and hopping PERIOD Combo aerobics involve low and highimpact movements she said PERIOD

Lew said she participates mainly in lowimpact and combo aerobics because they are not as jarring to the body and unlike running dont aggravate her back problem PERIOD

 said Kenny who also teaches in the Universitys department of exercise and sport science PERIOD

 she said PERIOD

 said Mary Hughes coordinator and instructor at Lady Nautilus  Aerobics Plus  E PERIOD Beaver Ave PERIOD

Other variations on standard aerobics range from classes with names like superaerobics  an hourandahalflong workout with  to  minutes of both lowand highimpact aerobics  to dynarobics which includes highintensity lowimpact aerobics both found at Lady Nautilus PERIOD

Another different type is aquasize  the use of cardiovascular and muscle toning exercises performed in water PERIOD Although Kenny said aquasize has existed for about  years 

The water provides greater resistance than air in aerobics and also reduces the impact but similar to other forms of aerobics aquasize causes its share of injuries Kenny said PERIOD

Besides aquasize the University also offers highimpact lowimpact and combo classes for students and a variety of classes for faculty and staff including step aerobics and a walking program PERIOD

DiMarcello said she isnt sure where aerobics is headed PERIOD
