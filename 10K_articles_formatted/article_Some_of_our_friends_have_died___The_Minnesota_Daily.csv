by  Gabriel ShapiroPublished  April  

The lights come up the crowd explodes into applause and screams the band rifles into the first song and the night as they say is on PERIOD

The euphoria of a great live performance for artist and audience alike is a thrill that is impossible to capture and contain PERIOD The desire to freeze in time a fantastic live event is understandable but more often than not the effort is in vain PERIOD The question then becomes Why bother

That leads to speculation about the purpose of live albums do bands only fall back on these releases when they are in a writing slump Good live albums that are truly live are few and far between PERIOD But former Velvet Underground frontman and New York music scene mainstay Lou Reed has taken this often misused and maligned form and given it a new lease on life PERIOD

Animal Serenade is more than a recital of career highs it is a retooling of classics and an exhibit of new work PERIOD All of which is so beautifully performed that it feels more like deja vu than memory PERIOD We might have heard these songs before but not like this PERIOD

Reeds signature sounds are all over this luxuriant doubledisc set PERIOD His voice ranges from indifferent halfmumbles to strained cries PERIOD His burning guitar tones can just as easily slice you with a lead or pummel you with beating chords and then all at once be rained in to a rhythmic jazzinflected rolling boil PERIOD Reeds musical John Hancock is a spectrum rather than a single point and every shade is pure Lou PERIOD

The sounds that surround these landmarks are different than the familiar studio versions on Reeds albums PERIOD Cello synths and backing vocals all form an envelope in which Reed can stand out while still being an integral part of the large fabric of each song PERIOD

The absence of percussion stands in stark contrast to the original versions of the classics PERIOD The bass cello and guitar are often played in a percussive staccato PERIOD The beat is there and it pulses  just not from the typical sources PERIOD

There has never been any doubt that Lou Reed was an American classic a rough gem of a genius PERIOD He keeps proving it over and over again PERIOD His albums and songs continue to inspire and influence artists of all stripes even as he himself continues to evolve and grow PERIOD This recording is a fantastic use of the live format to showcase Reed in top form playing songs that in a better world would all be hits PERIOD
