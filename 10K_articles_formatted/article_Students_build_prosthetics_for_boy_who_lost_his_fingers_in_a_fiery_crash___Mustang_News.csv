In April  10yearold Julian Reynoso and his family were hit by a suspected drunk driver in Los Angeles PERIOD The familys minivan caught fire and only Julian and his mother Elizabeth Flores survived PERIOD Reynosos father Juan younger sister Emma and younger brother Sebastian did not survive the accident PERIOD

Reynoso was left with  percent of his body burned and had only one functioning finger along with parts of the nine other fingers PERIOD

Cal Poly engineering students will present Reynoso with two custom prosthetic hands on June  at the Advanced Technologies Lab ATL from  p.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD

I wanted to provide a restoring force for him mechanical engineering senior Ryan Kissinger said PERIOD That kind of atrocity those kinds of things that happened to him it just means something PERIOD I think as human beings showing compassion to other people is what really is most essential and most important PERIOD Its at the root of everything that we do as engineers PERIOD Its to provide for people to provide for peoples ability to live. kissinger heard about Reynosos story through the Quality of Life Plus QL club at Cal Poly and was chosen to be the Hands for Julian team lead PERIOD From there Kissinger selected eight team members out of  applicants PERIOD

The team worked on both a right and left hand for Reynoso for about six months so he could have the ability to play with legos once again Kissinger said PERIOD

With Reynosos severe injuries from the accident the Hands for Julian team faced many challenges PERIOD Reynosos scar tissue changing hand size and distant location forced the team to reevaluate molds and designs for the two hands after working from  hours per week on the project PERIOD

This is engineering with a purpose mechanical engineering junior and coteam lead Austin Conrad said PERIOD Though there is a lot to it  theres a lot of heartache theres a lot of energy and time spent doing this and pushing through design failure after design failure to get to something that works the most meaningful part the part that keeps you putting all those hours in is Julian at the end. since the accident was so recent and so severe emotions also factor into the project PERIOD

The emotional factor makes it difficult Conrad said PERIOD Elizabeth lost her husband and two of her babies and the last remaining one is now learning how to try to exist in the world that isnt designed for someone at that level of disability. kissinger Conrad and the rest of the team have been working for months on constructing two hands that are each designed differently based on Reynosos ability for his existing left and right hand PERIOD

Reynosos left hand injuries are more severe than the right therefore requiring a completely different design PERIOD The right prosthetic hand Kissinger said has no motors or electronics and is just mechanical PERIOD The team originally spent hours on a complex design for the right hand then realized the need for a simpler design sort of like a baseball glove with finger attachments Kissinger said PERIOD The left prosthetic hand is robotic designed with Swiss motors and is overall a mechatronic left hand Kissinger said PERIOD

The two prosthetic hands are designed to last about two years both Kissinger and Conrad said so the team is manufacturing parts of the prosthetics out of metal and robust materials that will last for the twoyear plan PERIOD The team left a bit of clearance in the socket of the prosthetic so that as Reynosos hands grow he can get new molds but still use the same socket made of safe materials for his hands PERIOD

Biomedical engineering professor and QL Lab Director Lily Hsu Laiho said the team of student engineers worked completely independently on this project and put in countless hours of work without earning class credit or compensation PERIOD The students did not learn how to do any of this in classes Laiho said so the students did their own research and built everything from scratch PERIOD

They get the opportunity to apply their engineering skills to improve the quality of life for someone and I think specifically for this one they can see in Julians case the direct impact Laiho said PERIOD

The students work will not only enable Reynoso to do more everyday tasks but will also hopefully show Reynoso that students who did not even know him cared about him and about improving his life Laiho said PERIOD

Conrad said the team is assembling a user manual of videos and photos along with a toolbox to help Reynoso and his mother use maintain and repair the two prosthetic hands as needed PERIOD If there are issues beyond the scope of the user manual and toolbox Conrad said the QL Lab staff will be sent down as needed to help Reynoso and follow up with him postproject PERIOD

After the two years are up the Hands for Julian team will have the process laid out for future QL Lab teams so they can progress Reynosos prosthetics to something more updated for what he needs at the time after his hands have hopefully stabilized and improved according to Conrad PERIOD

Tickets to see Reynoso receive his new prosthetic hands from the team of engineers on June  at the ATL on campus are available for  PERIOD The ticket revenue will go back to the QL Lab Kissinger said PERIOD

The team said they look forward to the smile on Reynosos face when they present him with his custom prosthetic hands PERIOD Conrad said he is also looking forward to the smile and big hug from Reynosos mother PERIOD
