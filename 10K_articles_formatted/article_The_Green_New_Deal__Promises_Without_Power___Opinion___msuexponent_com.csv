Montanans cherish their cold smoke powder iceskating and snowmobiling and climate change could mean a fundamental change in the quality of our worldclass winter PERIOD NASA believes the magnitude at which climate change continues depends largely on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere as well as humanitys ability to alleviate or adapt to changes PERIOD So its up to us to begin making changes PERIOD

In hopes of mitigating longterm effects of climate change and making our existence a more earthfriendly one Rep PERIOD Alexandria OcasioCortez and Sen PERIOD Edward Markey released a 14page proposal known as the Green New Deal on Feb PERIOD    PERIOD The Green New Deal takes a successful swing at combining a progressive Rooseveltera economic approach with modern ideas like renewable energy PERIOD Social justice initiatives in the policy recognize climate changes disproportionate effect in communities of lowincome people migrants and people of color PERIOD This concept known as environmental injustice has long been recognized and was studied by the Environmental Protection Agency in the  study Particulate Matter Pollution. implementing universal basic income and healthcare is the first step to building resilience and the ability of communities to recover from natural disasters and the impending effects of the climate crisis PERIOD

Various climate change groups across the country including the Sunrise Movement and the Sierra Club support the proposal citing the immediate need for solutions and change PERIOD But economists scientists and much of Congress question whether the Green New Deal can be implemented successfully PERIOD

The Green New Deal fails to address the implementation of nearly every brazen proposal within it PERIOD While it promises to provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States and achieve netzero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers in  years the document is painfully vague. it lacks any methods for how we will switch to  percent renewable energy with our current technology how we will provide millions of Americans jobs with full benefits and how much it will actually cost to put this Green New Deal into effect PERIOD

At the moment we have not developed sufficient technology to completely ditch fossil fuels which represent about fourfifths of the nations energy supply and switch to clean power PERIOD Experts across the country questioned whether the proposal is feasible within the tenyear timeline given by OcasioCortez and the answer is overwhelmingly no. john Holdren a professor of environmental policy at Harvard commented on the issue PERIOD As a technologist studying this problem climate change for  years I dont think we can do it Holdren said PERIOD Transitioning to  percent clean energy would also necessitate ending coal mining and decommissioning all natural gas plants  measures that economists fear would be nearly impossible to do without collapsing the economy PERIOD

As for cost the American Action Forum estimates that the entire Green New Deal encompassing both energy and social justice policies would cost between . trillion and . trillion PERIOD That equates to about a  contribution from every American household PERIOD Two large issues transportation and deterrence from fossil fuels would make up the majority of this cost PERIOD The policy relies on completely overhauling transportation systems which experts believe would require major financial investments regulations and new taxes PERIOD In addition a tax on greenhouse gas emissions to deter the production of fossil fuels is likely PERIOD The proposal fails to provide a costeffective and commercially feasible energy supply PERIOD

Instead of pouring trillions of American dollars into this vague aspirational proposal a fraction of the money could be much better spent in other environmentallyfriendly ways PERIOD Since the technology required to switch over to  percent renewable energy doesnt yet exist perhaps the government could fund a new federal agency tasked with developing and innovating efficient and environmentallyfriendly energy sources so that we may better tackle climate change PERIOD Just as NASA develops technology for space exploration a new federal agency could invest the money in science and engineering so that the Green New Deal becomes a plausible solution to climate change PERIOD

The Green New Deal is a vague 14page document that lists goals without any way to reach them PERIOD When looking at the future of Earths climate we must examine the capabilities of our current economy and technologies and build a solution based on reality rather than a farfetched politicians dream PERIOD
