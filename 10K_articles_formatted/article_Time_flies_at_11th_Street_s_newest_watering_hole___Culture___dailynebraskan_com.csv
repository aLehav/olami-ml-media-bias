Tic Toc isnt your typical bar PERIOD

Established in November  Tic Toc is the newest addition to the growing number of businesses along eleventh Street PERIOD The bar is owned by Carolyn Nolte Scott Schroeder and SaRena Freet and has a communitybased approach for its patrons PERIOD

Tic Toc is different because its a smaller space with a cozy atmosphere Freet said PERIOD We have simple basic good drinks. the walls and even part of the ceiling are adorned with clocks of all shapes and sizes PERIOD Found at rummage sales Goodwill and other odd places  patrons staff and friends have all contributed a clock to the arrangement PERIOD None of the clocks display the actual time  something the owners are proud of PERIOD

Tic Toc has a different feel Nolte said PERIOD Its hard to explain PERIOD Blue and white clouds emerge on Tic Tocs walls with clocks floating above  its a peaceful dreamlike setting PERIOD I like that of the clocks on our walls none are accurate PERIOD Maybe not knowing the time allows for more time where right now this moment is important. every day the bar offers happy hour prices from  p.m PERIOD with all drinks  off PERIOD In addition to classic and seasonal cocktails a small tap offers beer drinkers their choice in domestic local and craft brews with plans to rotate the selections seasonally PERIOD The bar also features a small stage for local musicians to showcase talents PERIOD Freet said she would like to host other events such as poetry readings as it fits the communitys interests PERIOD

Its a space for people to be able to utilize whatever they think it is worth Freet said PERIOD

The owners attribute much of their excitement about starting the business to joining other establishments on eleventh Street PERIOD

There is a lot of diversity on this block Freet said PERIOD Each establishment offers something different PERIOD There are staples that are already on this street that help establish businesses like Tic Toc PERIOD More bars bring more people and it makes eleventh Street more of a destination. nolte echoed Freets comments with her own praise of the developing block PERIOD

For the last  years I have been part of the neighborhood as a resident and employee she said PERIOD I see Tic Toc as a deeper investment in this great neighborhood PERIOD The eleventh Street community has a lot of potential. while the bars that reside in the Haymarket and along O Street are at the forefront of Lincolns nightlife Tic Toc provides a more intimate alternative for a night out PERIOD Instead of loud music blaring from a DJ one can expect to hear lively conversation while inside the bar PERIOD

My personal hope is that Tic Toc becomes a space for conversation and connection Nolte said PERIOD We rush around so much PERIOD Our smart phones beep stuff to do or check or view PERIOD We have lists of things to do PERIOD We have a lot of demands on our time PERIOD I would like Tic Toc be a place where lists melt away and demands slow down. aside from continuing its service to the eleventh Street neighborhood Tic Toc has one objective in mind for its immediate future Add more clocks Freet said with a laugh PERIOD The more clocks the merrier. artsdailynebraskan.com
