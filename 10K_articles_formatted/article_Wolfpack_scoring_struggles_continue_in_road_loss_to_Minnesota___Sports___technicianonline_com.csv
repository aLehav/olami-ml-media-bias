Junior midfielder Tziarra King shoots the ball against ECU on Thursday Aug PERIOD   at Dail Soccer Field PERIOD Despite playing two overtime halves the Wolfpack tied the Pirates  PERIOD

The Wolfpack suffered a tough loss to the University of Minnesota on Thursday night as it fell in a  shutout to the Golden Gophers PERIOD

Minnesota  scored the lone goal in the match converting a corner kick with a header in the fifty-ninth minute PERIOD The win was the first of the season for the Golden Gophers despite being last years Big  Champions PERIOD

NC State  with its same starting eleven that it has seen for most of the season couldnt seem to get lucky outshooting Minnesota  in the match but not finding the back of the net despite that advantage PERIOD

The Pack seemed to have tied it in the seventy-sixth minute with freshman forward Jameese Joseph placing the ball past the goalkeeper however the play was ruled offside further piling onto the Wolfpacks misfortune PERIOD

NC State has struggled out of the gate this season failing to take advantage of seemingly favorable matchups PERIOD The Pack is  on the road this season and  at home not being able to show favor for either scenario PERIOD Last season the Wolfpack went  at home and  on the road managing to come out positive in both and starting the season  PERIOD

Despite the Packs strong performance against its last opponent Duquesne on September  NC State has struggled in its last few games PERIOD With being shut out twice in its last three games the offense has seemingly dried up PERIOD

Scoring is a surprising issue for a Wolfpack team with a lot of offensive talent PERIOD senior forward Tziarra King is ranked fourth in the NCAA in career goals among active players with  PERIOD However this year King is the jointleading scorer with only two goals in five games but it isnt from a lack of trying PERIOD King had all five of NC States shots in the first half with three being on net PERIOD

NC State will return home to take on Furman Sunday Sept PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD before it starts a fivegame road trip PERIOD The Wolfpack will need to pick up the win at home if it hopes to be able to build momentum into the long trip PERIOD
