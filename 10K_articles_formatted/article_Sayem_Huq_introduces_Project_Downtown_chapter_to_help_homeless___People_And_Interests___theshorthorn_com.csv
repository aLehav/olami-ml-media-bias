Disc jockey for UTA Radio PERIOD Author of a book by high school graduation PERIOD Philanthropist PERIOD Sigma Tau Delta president PERIOD

However you define him English language junior Sayem Huq is a multifaceted person PERIOD

But his biggest love right now is launching a new chapter of an organization for people to volunteer to help the homeless PERIOD

It is called Project Downtown and already has more than  chapters PERIOD However only  are currently active around the country from California to Florida PERIOD Project Downtowns first chapter is located in Miami Fla. where it started in  PERIOD Huq was only a sophomore in high school when it all began PERIOD

Project Downtown Arlington got the ball rolling in early August with its first volunteer session at Mission Arlington PERIOD

Huq said he wanted to have something similar to UTAs Big Event. the Big Event is an annual day of community service where UTA students go out to locations in the Arlington area PERIOD

Instead of having one day out of the semester to have one volunteer I thought it would be cool to do it once or twice every month he said PERIOD

Huq was born in Norway where he lived in the city of Trondheim for the first two years of his life PERIOD His father wanted to move to Canada in search of a job PERIOD He eventually found one in Ottawa but then moved and settled in Boca Raton Fla PERIOD

On Sept PERIOD  Project Downtown Arlington had its first campus volunteer session PERIOD Twentysix out of  members showed up to the event PERIOD Staff from Mission Arlington helped the group PERIOD

We went out to a nearby neighborhood on Park Row and they had a whole bunch of food bread all the essentials beef chicken apple sauce he said PERIOD

Huq said Pizza Hut even donated personal pan pizzas and breadsticks PERIOD Also kits with clothes socks and toothbrushes were given to people in the neighborhood PERIOD

A lot of people came over and we gave them the essentials he said PERIOD We walked it over to their apartments to make sure they didnt carry a heavy load. project Downtown was started in Miami by Huqs relative and friends PERIOD Duff Ullah is Huqs uncle and president of the Fort Lauderdale chapter of Project Downtown PERIOD Other chapters were started by friends of Huq who moved to across the country PERIOD

My chapter is not as organized as Sayems chapter PERIOD He is doing so much more than we ever did PERIOD Weve been around longer Ullah said PERIOD I always tell people that anyone can slip and we can be the ones out there that were helping. when Huq went to Fort Lauderdale he saw what Ullah was doing with his chapter and asked him how to start it off PERIOD Ullah responded to him by telling him to talk to his university and they would help him instead of him doing it by himself PERIOD

Psychology senior Pri Hossein is a friend of Huq and talked to him about wanting to give back to the Arlington community as well PERIOD

Huq said eventually hes going to try and create more chapters in Texas and in the Metroplex PERIOD

I have connections at UTDallas and I was wondering if they would help out in downtown Dallas he said PERIOD Maybe give it a year or two of growing in Arlington see how it works and roll it over to UTD PERIOD Its not for reputation or anything PERIOD Its just one of those things to give people opportunity to do it. he would also like to create chapters in Austin and San Antonio however the main focus at this moment is to get UTA students involved at the Arlington Chapter PERIOD

Ullah said Huq is doing an incredible job with Project Downtown Arlington PERIOD

Its crazy because he has so much on his plate and he still has time to give back to the community he said PERIOD When Sayem wants to do something he is very very determined PERIOD If theres something he wants to do its going to happen and thats what I love about him. there are  Project Downtown chapters that are active out of  across the country
