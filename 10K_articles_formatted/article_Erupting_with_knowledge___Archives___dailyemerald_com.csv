7649,1970-01-01,"university freshman Kristen Faurias passion for geology developed as a sixthgrader visiting Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii PERIOD She began asking questions relating to science and nature and longed for answers PERIOD Today these questions have led her to an internship on the island of Dominica an understudied and potentially active and dangerous volcanic area in the eastern Caribbean PERIOD

Fauria a Eugene native leaves today to study at the University of Arkansas before heading to Dominica in a week with a group of professors and students selected for the highly competitive National Science Foundations Research Experience for Undergraduates program PERIOD

I always ask questions and have lots of interests on why things are the way they are within social science and culture but the most important questions to me are why mountains are big and gravity is the way it is Fauria said PERIOD

Fauria smiles widely from behind her long hair while talking about her passion for nature PERIOD Her friend University freshman Emma Kallaway describes the outdoors as Faurias playground PERIOD

I really learned how to love the outdoors from Kristen this year she always finds so much beauty Kallaway said PERIOD

The pair who go camping hiking and running together took a long walk around Eugene recently and Kallaway said Fauria stopped at one point to explain the layers of a rock although not in a lecturing way but in an excited to know way she said PERIOD

She loves to explore and is very passionate about knowing more Kallaway said PERIOD

While studying geology and physics this year Fauria said she knew she wanted to pursue an internship with REU but she didnt expect to be selected until at least summer of  PERIOD

I thought they sent the email to me on accident PERIOD I was convinced they sent it to the wrong person Fauria said PERIOD

Fauria said what stands out about this program is working in the field as well as in the lab PERIOD Fauria said the majority of the available geology internships only allow students to analyze research already taken PERIOD

On top of being the location for Pirates of the Caribbean its an island that has eight volcanoes and is on a subduction zone Fauria said of the area she will study PERIOD

During the month of researchgathering in Dominica Fauria and other students will go out in small groups with professors and choose to concentrate on either volcanic or tectonic research PERIOD

Its really one of the most underdeveloped islands of the Caribbean PERIOD Nearly  percent is still rainforest Fauria said PERIOD Its so poorly understood PERIOD The volcanoes are really understudied and they could pose a possible danger to the population. fauria said there is no way to predict whether the volcanoes are going to erupt but any research they can gather will help keep the population safer by having a greater understanding about the region PERIOD

According to the Seismic Research Unit at the University of the West Indies there are  live volcanoes in the Eastern Caribbean meaning theyre likely to erupt PERIOD

Additionally two volcanic eruptions in the Eastern Caribbean have made the surrounding areas completely uninhabitable one erupted in  and another in  according to the Web site PERIOD

Fauria said she expects to learn a lot while working in the field and is excited to become a better scientist and researcher PERIOD

On July  Fauria and other students will return to their host schools where they will analyze the data collected and write a paper or presentation on their findings PERIOD Fauria will return from Arkansas at the end of July PERIOD

I think she would be a really good person to work with because shes always rearing to go Kallaway said adding the two go circuit training twice a week at  a.m PERIOD Fauria always has a smile on her face and is excited for the workout she said PERIOD

In preparation for the trip Fauria has been taking her regular geology and science classes in addition to a sitting in on a petrology course and attending the class field trips PERIOD Petrology focuses on the study of rocks and how they form PERIOD Fauria also described herself as being the question kid in the geology department lately PERIOD

Her Petrology GTF Daniele McKay said Faurias constant questioning reveals how eager she is to learn about the science PERIOD

At a certain level its skill and understanding the science and whats going on and studying the minute details but I think what drives that in scientific questioning is passion McKay said PERIOD

Fauria said her passion is what motivates her as well PERIOD

Its really motivating to be pushed to your intellectual and physical extremes and know you will have to do more than you ever had before she said PERIOD
