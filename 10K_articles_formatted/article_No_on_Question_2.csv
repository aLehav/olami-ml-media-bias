Background on Question 

Question  is a response to the Supreme Courts  Citizens United decision PERIOD This ruling equated any money spent on political issues  such as independent ads and donations to PACs  to free speech meaning any attempt to regulate money spent by corporations unions or other groups would be in violation of their First Amendment rights PERIOD Corporations can now fund political campaigns with few limitations PERIOD

A Yes on Question  would authorize the formation of a citizens commission of  people that would investigate political spending in Massachusetts and create a report suggesting a Constitutional amendment to prevent artificial entities from being afforded the same free speech rights as individuals PERIOD This would in essence restrict the ability of corporations unions and other groups to contribute to political campaigns PERIOD

The commission and the report would only be a small first step however PERIOD Any proposal for a

Constitutional amendment needs the support of  states or twothirds of the House and Senate PERIOD

Currently Massachusetts is the only state officially working toward this goal. note While this is not my personal opinion I will share the arguments against Question  in order to allow our readers to make an informed decision. the main argument against Question  is that it threatens the integrity of free speech for individuals as well as corporations PERIOD

Bradley Smith founder of the Institute of Free Speech and former FEC chairman has spoken out against this ballot initiative though he is not from Massachusetts PERIOD In an interview with WBUR news he said We protect corporate rights because that protects the rights of the individual. he claims taking away an organizations right to free speech in politics could threaten other union or corporate rights PERIOD

Then youre saying a labor union has no constitutional right to speak on behalf of its members Smith said PERIOD Youre saying a corporation has no constitutional right to demand a warrant before police search its premises without reason. some say such an amendment could be taken even further allowing the government to censor movies books and other media released by corporations or unions around the time of an election PERIOD

Additionally they claim proposing amendments to the U.S PERIOD constitution could set a dangerous

precedent for silencing political voices in the future PERIOD In his interview with WBUR Smith said the Massachusetts ballot question could have a dangerous ripple effect. paul Craney a spokesman for the conservative group Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance said in a public debate that passing Question  would empower state lawmakers and a bunch of politicians in Boston to come up with ways to restrict your freedom of speech. beyond the attacks on free speech opponents claim it is actually in politicians best interest to silence corporations PERIOD

They claim spending following the Citizens United ruling will make it easier for outside competitors to rise up against incumbents using corporate and union financing that they would not have had before PERIOD With more money available the argument goes new political players who dont necessarily have independent access to funds are able to compete on a larger scale PERIOD

Those opposed to Question  are not overly concerned with corporate spending in politics and see no need to take a stance against it PERIOD In this case any citizens right to free speech  be that the individual or the company treated as the individual  is not worth risking in order to keep money out of politics PERIOD
