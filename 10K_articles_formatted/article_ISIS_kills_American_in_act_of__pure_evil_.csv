The Islamic State militant group called ISIS released a video on Nov PERIOD  showing the beheading
of a dozen Syrian soldiers as well as the beheading of 26yearold American Peter Kassig also known by his Islamic convert name AbdulRahman PERIOD

Kassig was an aid worker in Lebanon and Syria and was captured in October  PERIOD He was also a former U.S PERIOD Army Ranger PERIOD

The video is one of four in a series that has been released since August  PERIOD The prior videos which have been released periodically featured the beheadings of British natives David Haines and Alan Henning as well as Americans James Foley and Steven J PERIOD Sotloff PERIOD

The nearly  minutelong propaganda video shows a history of the Islamic State and ends with Kassigs beheading by a Jihadist man believed to be the executioner in the videos PERIOD The man has been nicknamed Jihadi John. in the videos prior to Kassigs the men were beheaded on camera PERIOD Many who have watched the video are attempting to analyze why they changed the format PERIOD

The most obvious difference is in the beheading itself  the previous videos all showed the beheading on camera Daveed GartensteinRoss a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization said PERIOD I dont think this was the Islamic States choice PERIOD

The likeliest possibility is that something went wrong when they were beheading him. analysts believe that the differences could have been that the extremists did not have as much time outside as they had to film previous videos due to increased aerial surveillance PERIOD Others believe that Kassig would not cooperate and would not allow them to stage the killing as planned PERIOD

President Obama responded to the video calling Kassigs death an act of pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity. httpswww.instagram.comxavier.newswire
