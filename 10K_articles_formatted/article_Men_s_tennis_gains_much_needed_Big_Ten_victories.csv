Whether it was junior Alex Petrones marathon rallies back and forth or redshirt junior Justin Rossi fighting off five deuce points in a set deciding game with pain in his right arm from the moment the first serve was tossed into the air it was evident that the Michigan mens tennis team was going to have to fight for this win PERIOD

Though the score didnt reflect it the Wolverines had to work hard to pull out the win against Nebraska in a marathon match that lasted over four hours Sunday morning at the Varsity Tennis center PERIOD

Michigan  Big Ten  overall played some of its best tennis of the year even though it was without junior Michael Zhu who was dealing with an illness PERIOD Still the Wolverines were able to sweep their Big Ten opponents this weekend defeating the Cornhuskers   and the Hawkeyes     and  respectively PERIOD

We have had a lot of close matches this year and to win two matches in a weekend should be a big boost to our confidence heading into the rest of the Big Ten season said Michigan coach Bruce Berque PERIOD We just played good tennis PERIOD The fact that we have had a few guys sick or hurt in the last three matches caused our team to raise its level of alertness and realize that every guy has to step up and do their best job and they cant depend on anyone else. michigan was able to secure the doubles point in both matches this weekend with the tandem of freshman Kevin Wong and senior Shaun Bernstein leading the way PERIOD The duo won both of its matches which gave them  wins on the season  a team best PERIOD

Not only did the Wolverines have to fight for their victory Sunday but also ride on their teammates and fans for support PERIOD The team usually stands in the observing stairwell cheering on their teammates from above but this time the Michigan players were on the court PERIOD

One of our things is when we have one match remaining in doubles or singles we get down on the court and try to have some extra energy to pull them through Burque said PERIOD

The entire team came down the court to cheer on Rossi and Petrone with one game left to play PERIOD With his teammates cheering him on up  Rossi fired two aces PERIOD

In singles play Michigan won all its matches including four in straight sets PERIOD

Limited by a pulled pectoral muscle Petrone managed to give the Wolverines their first singles point of the match defeating Nebraskas Dusty Boyer   PERIOD With his win Saturday against Iowa Petrone earned his first two career victories at the No PERIOD  singles position  a void left by Evan King PERIOD

Wong followed shortly thereafter with a   victory to win his fourth straight singles match PERIOD Junior Vlad Stefan clinched the singles point with a straightset win PERIOD

Rossi rounded out the blowout victory by defeating Cornhuskers Tom Blackwell PERIOD Rossi played a hardfought marathon match that lasted almost three hours and rallied from behind to win    PERIOD

Brutal just brutal Rossi said PERIOD Blackwell took everything out of me PERIOD He plays amazing defense and it is so hard to put the ball away PERIOD It is frustrating playing someone like that because you feel like you have to hit five or six winners. the two were heated often yelling across the court over shots and calls PERIOD The tensions even continued after that match PERIOD One Nebraska player cursed in his team huddle about the way their team was being treated PERIOD

Tensions aside with the wins over Iowa and the Cornhuskers Michigan has itself back above . in the conference  good for sixth PERIOD
