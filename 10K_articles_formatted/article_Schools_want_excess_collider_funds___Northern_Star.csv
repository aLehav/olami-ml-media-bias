By  Susie SnyderJanuary  

With about  million of state funds remaining from an unsuccessful attempt to build the Superconducting Super Collider in Illinois state universities are hoping to grab a portion of the leftovers to fund additional science and technology projects PERIOD

Ross Hodel associate director for the Illinois Board of Higher Education said the board is not trying to gain the entire amount PERIOD Were just pointing out that the state has this much money available and how much more the state universities need he said PERIOD

The IBHE will ask the Illinois General Assembly for . million to fund science and technology capital improvement and repair and renovation projects for the  academic year he said PERIOD

Hodel said the IBHE hopes to win the Illinois General Assemblys approval by emphasizing the need for more money to expand and improve Illinois science and technology projects PERIOD The board will request about  million of the total for science and technology projects he said PERIOD

If the funds are granted by the General Assembly NIU will receive about  million of the requested . million and will spend about  million of that amount on science and technology Hodel said PERIOD

odel said the IBHE will not know how much of their proposal will be granted until the state budget is completed in March PERIOD

About  million of the science and technology funds will be spent to fund the Faraday II project PERIOD About  will be used to construct a new engineering building PERIOD

The IBHE believes they have a good shot at the money because it is already put aside Hodel said PERIOD We probably wont get  percent of the money we are asking for but we should make major strides he said PERIOD

Sen PERIOD Patrick Welch DPeru said Tuesday that the main hurdle the IBHE will face is every state group will want the money available from the SSC fund PERIOD Welch said however that he believes the money should be spent on education PERIOD

State legislation should not jump headfirst into something they dont know theyre getting into and should carefully study all proposed projects before they allocate any money Welch said PERIOD

Rep PERIOD John Countryman RDeKalb said he applauds the efforts of the IBHE but they have to be realistic about how much money there is available. he said the SSC fund was appropriated for fiscal year  and will be needed to cover any cost overruns from that fiscal year PERIOD

In addition to covering the overruns the SSC fund might be put towards a new state policy of maintaining a  million balance in the state budget Countryman said PERIOD
