Zines or independentlyproduced publications reached a newhigh in public visibility and accessibility in Richmond this week as a result of the tenth annual Zinefest on Oct PERIOD  at Richmond Public Library and the opening of the Richmond Independent Zine Library RIZL at nonprofit art space Gallery5 on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Zinefest grows larger each year said Zinefest coorganizer Brian Baynes PERIOD During his four years organizing the event Baynes said its steadily become more diverse and better attended PERIOD

It falls in place easier each year Baynes said PERIOD We used to struggle to get tablers PERIOD Now we sell out. according to Baynes Zinefest is more of a forum than a marketplace PERIOD While it is about trading ideas it costs money to make zines so it must cost money to acquire them too PERIOD Ideally if zines could be made and traded for free then they should be said Baynes PERIOD

I like that unlike a lot of things a zine doesnt have a golden standard Baynes said PERIOD In movies and music theres this standard of what is and isnt PERIOD Theres no this is the best zine. a zines biggest strength is that as long as youre passionate enough to make one then it can be accessible to everyone Baynes said PERIOD

Richmond has a great small press culture PERIOD It ties in with DIY culture and the arts school here said VCUarts alumni and member of zinester group Clown Kisses Press James McPherson PERIOD

Many arts students want to create something independent of VCU and so many of them produce zines McPherson said PERIOD Fostering a zine community is the best way support creatives and makers McPherson said PERIOD

To think that most of the people here live in my city working hard like I am its inspiring said Richmond artist and tabler Carlton Nivens PERIOD

Nivens said Zinefest gave him a deadline and incentive to finish package and present his art rather than post it online PERIOD

Zines are complete creative freedom said Richmond artist and Zinefest tabler Christina Allen PERIOD

Having so many creatives in one location raises the bar for her as an artist Allen said PERIOD Not as a competition but as a way to build off each other she said PERIOD

Last year I just walked around PERIOD Ive lived in Richmond my whole life and I didnt know Zinefest existed said Richmond artist and tabler Cait Morris PERIOD I was determined to have a table this year. the best part of zines is theyre selfpublished Morris said PERIOD In a zine you dont have to cater to anyones interest but your own PERIOD

Its accessible to both the creator and the person looking at it said Richmond artist and tabler Izzi Atkinson PERIOD Theyre usually simple and handmade and easily communicate to everyone. the RIZL is located on the second floor of Gallery5 and open Wednesday  p.m PERIOD to  p.m. and Thursday Friday and Saturday from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD

As someone who has worked in academic and public libraries while both have zine collections theyre not as open and accessible as this space said Zinefest coorganizer and RIZL librarian Celina Williams PERIOD Other libraries have so many other responsibilities to the public PERIOD This space is all about zines. vCUs Cabell Library does have zines but theyre behind a desk on a shelf in an archive box said Williams PERIOD This makes them hard or even intimidating to engage with PERIOD

For a lot of people zines can help you find a community said Williams PERIOD

Zines are perfect for people that are more introverted Williams said because it is a comfortable way to engage with people and their ideas at your own pace PERIOD Within a zine you can find anything from a P.O PERIOD box to an email address or phone number Williams said PERIOD

If youre a community then its great to put out zines Williams said PERIOD To be completely in control of your own media and grow your community around ideas. zines are organized on the shelf loosely into topics with significant overlap Williams said PERIOD One of the goals of RIZL is to be open and flexible to change and as a result the zines on the display could likely change from week to week Williams said PERIOD

A lot of zines that deal with private subject matter but cover a broad range of subject Williams said PERIOD This way people can engage and explore with whats on the shelf easily. topics on the shelves now include art assemblage comics fanzines genderqueer consent health and advocacy poc feminism poetryprose and politics PERIOD

This is for everyone PERIOD Its a community space PERIOD We exist outside of academia said Gallery5 program director Claude Marin Dustin Fenton PERIOD For a lot of people who dont feel comfortable going to VCUs library because they arent students or are outside of the traditional age and culture they can feel welcome here. according to Fenton RIZL offers a space to read as well as a minigallery that features artwork associated with the zines on display and special collections that rotate on a bimonthly basis PERIOD There is also a printer and workspace for those interested in making their own zines Fenton said PERIOD

This is completely free space mostly run on a volunteer basis Fenton said PERIOD Donations are very welcome. jesse Adcock
