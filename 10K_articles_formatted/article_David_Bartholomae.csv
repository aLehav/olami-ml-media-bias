The Pitt News spoke with Bartholomae about where he came from and his achievements as an English professor PERIOD

The Pitt News Where are you from and how did you find your way to Pitt

David Bartholomae Well Im from Akron Ohio PERIOD I went to do my graduate work at Rutgers University and I was training to be a Victorianist PERIOD I got interested in teaching writing and it was part of a general movement to turn attention to general education and the teaching of writing PERIOD I had a job offer at Boston University to be a Victorianist and job offer here to come and work in the composition program PERIOD I surprised all my friends colleagues and professors by coming here to teach composition instead of going to Boston to be a Victorianist PERIOD

TPN Did you know you wanted to teach English early on or did you just love reading and writing first and then figured out you loved to teach

DB For almost everyone going into this line of work you have no idea what teaching is like PERIOD You devote yourself to a Ph.D PERIOD  thats a long haul PERIOD Now most graduate students are also teaching assistants PERIOD I just about completed my Ph.D PERIOD in  and had never been teaching in a classroom before PERIOD I went to college thinking Id be a football coach PERIOD I played football in college PERIOD My high school coach was an English teacher so I thought Id become a football coach and an English teacher PERIOD I didnt like writing at first though PERIOD I began to like it through the long haul PERIOD . pERIOD I liked art I liked ideas I liked philosophy PERIOD I wanted to be a philosophy major and then an English major PERIOD

TPN Was there a specific reason that you chose Pittsburgh over Boston

DB I actually chose a career path PERIOD I came from an interesting program that was languagebased more than literaturebased PERIOD I was really interested in class and language PERIOD I went to graduate school on a National Defense Act fellowship and I was experiencing language and class firsthand on the firing line PERIOD During that time I was really interested in it and I was amazed at the possibilities of teaching and research PERIOD So the truth is I wasnt coming to Pittsburgh PERIOD I grew up in an industrial city but I wanted to pursue this career path and I loved the people here PERIOD

TPN You won the Pennsylvania Professor of the Year Award PERIOD How did that feel when you found out

DB I was pleased and honored PERIOD Your school nominates you and you send in a dossier and things like that PERIOD So of course I was honored but the professional recognition means more to me PERIOD Theres an award called the Francis Andrew March Award from the Modern Language Association PERIOD That one meant a lot because theyre the people in my profession and theyre recognizing my work that I did for a long time PERIOD I won a Chancellors Distinguished Teaching Award and that meant a lot to me because this is my school these were my colleagues and my students wrote for me PERIOD



TPN So in the end it was really the Ph.D PERIOD program that made you want to teach

DB Well not quite PERIOD I went through the entire program without teaching PERIOD Then at the very end of it I taught for the first time and I loved it PERIOD I knew people who hated it PERIOD Some of the smartest people I was in graduate school with either dropped out or didnt get tenure because they just found it was not a job they could give a lifetime to PERIOD You go to work every day and talk to students do projects and if its not interesting you wont want to stay for the long haul PERIOD",David Bartholomae,University of Pittsburgh
