Dear Mr PERIOD President Esteban and Dean Caltabiano

My name is Thomas Patrick Hughes and I am a graduate of the School of Music class of  PERIOD As an alumni of DePaul University there have been things that Ive taken with me since departing my education my passion to my craft and my strong unwavering belief in upholding the Vincentian values of kindness charity support and a sense of humility although as an artist the last of these can sometimes be a challenge PERIOD Since leaving DePaul and embarking on the next chapter of life Ive had time to reflect on my time at DePaul PERIOD

Ive also had the opportunity to look at the school from the outside and reflect on how it has changed in a mere five years PERIOD It doesnt seem like a huge amount of time on the grand scale of things and yet the school is completely different than when I first arrived PERIOD

The first thing Ive noticed is how DePaul didnt teach me Vincentian values that I didnt already have Ive always tried to show compassion and kindness to others Ive always carried myself humbly before others Ive always supported my colleagues and my community and Ive tried to set an example PERIOD We all fall short of the buck at times and Im no exemption PERIOD Im not perfect but I dont like to make mistakes repeatedly PERIOD

DePaul however did reinforce these values in me PERIOD There were several staff members who went above and beyond the call of duty Phil Verpil my academic advisor Assistant dean Dr PERIOD Kurt Westerberg former voice faculty Jane Bunnell former voice faculty Michael and Michele Sylvester and vocal coach Linda Hirt PERIOD Every single one of these individuals made the hell that was moving to a new city transferring to an incredibly expensive school the struggle of not being able to afford food or always have a roof over my head the struggle to succeed in school  they made it easier PERIOD

There was a time even when the students didnt form cliques where students from different musical backgrounds instruments or even majors would support one another and would befriend one another PERIOD And thats where I noticed the second thing there are fewer students especially within the School of Music who strive to uphold these same values that were instilled in me at a young age PERIOD

The values of St PERIOD Vincent de Paul arent just words written into a universitys mission statement or in the welcome packet PERIOD They shouldnt be simply something that sounds good when spoken PERIOD The values of St PERIOD Vincent de Paul are something that every student and faculty should not merely adhere to rather that should strive to uphold them within every inch of their being PERIOD


In the past five years the school that I came into has lost that sense of community with others PERIOD It has become more about being ahead than helping lift others up PERIOD It has become more about building barriers than breaking them PERIOD

In the past five years the school that I came into has lost that sense of community with others PERIOD It has become more about being ahead than helping lift others up PERIOD It has become more about building barriers than breaking them PERIOD

It has become more about financially draining the student than encouraging not only the best minds but encourage the best characters to strive to do their best in a competitive world have the humility to seek help when it is needed and to provide help and support when they are in a position to do so PERIOD DePaul has become a community from where I sit that is more focused on pushing others down to get to the top rather than picking someone up to finish the race together PERIOD And its not something Ive seen in students alone in faculty Ive witnessed people abusing the small amount of power that they have in order to gain or keep a competitively political edge over others PERIOD

Within a school of fine and performing arts you cannot attract a world class student body and talent if you do not have a world class faculty and youll never keep a world class faculty if they are never taken care of PERIOD In five years Ive watched the entire voice department be replaced PERIOD Some were let go for reasons beyond my understanding to which I will never ask nor assume why PERIOD

However several left because they were not given the job security that so many of their colleagues were being offered PERIOD My own voice professor felt as though they had very little say in events that happened with their own students or opera productions  they felt as though they rarely had a seat at the table and when they did their voice was never appreciated PERIOD Its not just them PERIOD Every voice faculty member that Ive talked to extensively has made the same remark the power dynamics within the School of Music and university as a whole does not care about their adjunct faculty adjunct faculty who do just as much as a fulltime staff without the job security PERIOD

Although this has become the norm within universities it does not have to be so within DePaul University itself PERIOD This university can be the example of what it truly means to be Vincentian treat others with the dignity and respect that we ourselves would want and should demand to value those who uphold these values and reward them for such PERIOD

As for the students I know it is difficult to screen students for character PERIOD Its not something Im saying the university can change PERIOD I am merely pointing out that my time at DePaul didnt get better over time PERIOD It became increasingly worse as the atmosphere changed from that of a closeknit community to that where politics within the staff and poor quality of character within the students were allowed to destroy the name and purpose of St PERIOD Vincent de Paul PERIOD

Although there is much more I could say this letter would run rather long PERIOD So I will leave with this does the world need another graduating student body of artists where their main focus in life isnt about giving

Do we need more individuals in the world driven by greed and selfishness Does the world need more nasty politics From my point of view what the world needs now is artists who create art for the sake of adding to the community PERIOD

The world needs leaders who are willing to help others build communities live and display kindness charity compassion and humility just as St PERIOD Vincent de Paul did PERIOD The world needs more Vincentians  Let DePaul University be the institution that makes that possible PERIOD

Sincerely

Thomas Patrick Hughes
