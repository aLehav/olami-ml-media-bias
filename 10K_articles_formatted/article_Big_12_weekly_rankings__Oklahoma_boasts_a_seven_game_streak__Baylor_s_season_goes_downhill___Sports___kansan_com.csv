 PERIOD Baylor Record   Big 

In late October the Bears were  and ranked the No PERIOD  team in the nation PERIOD Now the team is in the midst of a threegame losing streak and has lost its starting quarterback Seth Russell to a dislocated ankle for the remainder of the season PERIOD Itll be difficult for Baylor to regenerate some of the success it had early in the season PERIOD

 PERIOD Kansas State Record   Big 

KState will be hoping to take advantage of a struggling Baylor team in Waco Texas on Saturday PERIOD The Wildcats are only eighth in the Big  against the pass . yards per game but they should have more success with true freshman quarterback Zach Smith now under center for the Bears PERIOD

Before this weeks game Beaty said Iowa State was the best  team in the nation PERIOD The team mightve proved it was better than its record against Kansas on Saturday PERIOD After trailing  entering the fourth quarter Iowa State rallied to score  points and win  PERIOD The Cyclones also found success running the football  yards two touchdowns which is key to the teams offense PERIOD Most importantly quarterbacks Joel Lanning and Jacob Park appear to finally be an effective tandem under center after alternating games for parts of the season PERIOD

 PERIOD Kansas Record   Big 

Now enduring a ninegame losing streak and 19game conference losing streak Kansas is still looking to play with more consistency PERIOD One positive was the play of freshman quarterback Carter Stanley who threw for  yards and one touchdown in the loss to Iowa State PERIOD He threw a gamedeciding interception but in his limited time on the field this season he has provided more sparks than Montell Cozart and Ryan Willis for what has been a weak Jayhawk offense PERIOD Beaty has already said Stanley will likely be the starter against Texas next Saturday PERIOD
