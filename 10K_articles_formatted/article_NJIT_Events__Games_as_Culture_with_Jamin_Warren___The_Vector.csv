Thanks to the school of Art and Design as well as to the game design professors of NJIT who were gracious enough to tell their students about last Mondays talk in Weston Hall Jamin Warren came to NJIT PERIOD Warren of Kill Screen Daily and the PBS GameShow YouTube channel fame lectured about a topic I thought NJIT was never going to publicly acknowledge video games are art PERIOD Warren went a step further and said Video Games as Art No culture PERIOD

As provided every semester by the college of Art and Design through their lecture series Warren gave a talk about video games PERIOD As you should all know by now games are legally art PERIOD Jamin Warren added the bit about games being not just art but a part of our culture PERIOD Referencing the German sociologist George Simmel Jamin Warren explained that culture is defined from the way we think the way we act and the way we objectify something PERIOD

In terms of video games there is thinking involved in all of the choices you make in games acting through manipulation of a controller and then there is the object or medium that we use to play games the Oculus Rift being an example PERIOD Though this creates another interesting idea the art of play PERIOD

Today video games have become a huge part of our lives and if not video games definitely affect someone that we know PERIOD To say that video games arent a part of culture in the twenty-first century is forgetting that billions of people have cellphones games with gems and exploding pigs are all over the place PERIOD For some people their entire lives revolve around playing games PERIOD Thinking a little more deeply into it this drives home the idea that design is everywhere

Designing a game works the same way as designing pretty much anything else PERIOD Most game developers seem to forget that you dont need to design games based off other games PERIOD One of the biggest takeaways from Jamin Warrens talk is about how should you design a game not for yourself but for others PERIOD How is your game supposed to talk to someone How is someone supposed to think or interact with your game Why would someone play your game They are important ideas that have to be accounted for when we design something PERIOD

Not only should we think about designing for others but about what inspires our designs PERIOD A lot of games dont look to dissect other forms of art besides other video games PERIOD We cant design our games like this anymore PERIOD Games are culture PERIOD

Unfortunately this kind of thinking isnt normal in the game design programs of NJIT PERIOD Yes were ranked twenty-second out of  schools in the country currently the best in the state of New Jersey but there is still a long road ahead PERIOD

Hopefully we can improve game development at NJIT by having more talks with industry professionals like Warren PERIOD Perhaps then we can have more involvement between both the artists and technicians of game development in NJIT PERIOD While there are classes shared by the two fields it feels like a far cry from a full collaboration PERIOD For IT students there still isnt a game design lab PERIOD For DD students there are programming classes that are hard to sign up for PERIOD Video game design is one of the best programs at NJIT and I still feel like we should be fostering our game design program to reach further heights PERIOD

Its as Jamin Warren former culture writer for the Wall Street Journal said games are culture PERIOD
