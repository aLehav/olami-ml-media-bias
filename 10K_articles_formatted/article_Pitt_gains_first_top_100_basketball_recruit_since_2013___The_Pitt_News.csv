This has been a very tough decision but I have found the university and basketball program that I can accomplish all of my goals McGowens wrote on Twitter PERIOD That being said I am verbally committing to continue my basketballacademic career at the University of Pittsburgh under the leadership of Jeff Capel and his staff and come out with the Class of . the addition of this star recruit is the first major accomplishment for new head coach Jeff Capel whose reputation as a topnotch recruiter dates back to his time under Coach Krzyzewski at Duke PERIOD According to 247Sports.com McGowens is the 88thrated recruit in the class of  making him the first top100 player to commit to Pitt since Michael Young in  PERIOD

With the commitment McGowen is set to fill the Panthers most needed position  a ballhandling guard PERIOD With firstyear guards Marcus Carr and Parker Stewart both transferring firstyear Khameron Davis and junior Jared WilsonFrame were set to be Capels only two returning guards PERIOD

Next on the recruiting trail Capel will likely look to address the Panthers lack of height as firstyear Terrell Brown is the only returning player taller than 6foot6 who saw consistent court time last season PERIOD
