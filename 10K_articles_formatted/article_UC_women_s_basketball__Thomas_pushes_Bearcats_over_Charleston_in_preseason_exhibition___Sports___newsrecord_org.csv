UC head coach Michelle ClarkHeard pushed the pace offensively all game having the wing players run down the sidelines and Thomas rimrunning in the middle of the floor PERIOD The guards pushing the ball up the court seniors Sam Rodgers and Antoinette Miller lobbed the ball on the run to Thomas which resulted in layups or a turnover PERIOD UC finished with  turnovers but their playing style continues to be a work in progress PERIOD

We had passes today that just werent what we normally do ClarkHeard said PERIOD But this is our first time playing so we have to take back get notes and clean it up PERIOD We have to figure out a rotation and get continuity. uC was able to make up for the mistakes using a  press to force Charleston into  turnovers PERIOD The press and defensive rotations werent perfect however as Dakota Reeves lurked behind the arc and hit five uncontested threepointers PERIOD

It was just a lack of communication Miller said PERIOD We have to be better at knowing when somebody hits two threepointers on us we have to lock in and stop them PERIOD Just have to work on communicating better. miller had a shooting night of her own knocking down three threepointers and draining a jump shot just inside the arc to give UC its first points outside of the paint PERIOD The paint was an area the Bearcats dominated outscoring Charleston  PERIOD Rodgers was held without a field goal two free throws but did the dirty work coming up with three steals two charges to go along with four rebounds and four assists PERIOD

Rodgers is our floor leader ClarkHeard said PERIOD She talks all the time gets us in defense and does a lot of different things PERIOD We cant focus on if we make shots or not PERIOD We want to be a defensive team and build off of what we can do on that end. reeves led Charleston with  points and was able to do it in front of familiar faces as she graduated from West Clermont High School   miles east of UC PERIOD
