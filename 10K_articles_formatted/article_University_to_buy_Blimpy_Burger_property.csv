Though Krazy Jims Blimpy Burger will have been a fixture on South Division Street for  years come March the restaurant will soon be forced to relocate PERIOD

The University reached a deal with the owner of the property on which Blimpy Burger is located meaning the restaurant will have to find a new location during the summer of  according to Blimpy employee Kevin Gorine PERIOD

Gorine said Rich Magner the current owner of Blimpy Burger told employees that the famous burger joint will move out of the space when their lease is up in August PERIOD

Magner said he knew his lease was coming to an end in August but he hadnt given much thought to renewing before the University made a bid PERIOD Magner confirmed that the restaurant will remain open and operating until August PERIOD

It is what it is Magner said PERIOD If it had been a different person purchasing it it might have been where I could have renegotiated the lease with them or that kind of thing. he said he hopes to relocate to an area close to campus either downtown or on State Street which will take time to figure out PERIOD

Its not a fun thing for anyone when you have an icon in one location for so long he said PERIOD But I need to look at the positive side of it and hope that we can do it in a different spot. magner who has worked at Blimpy for more than  years said his employees usually work for him for several years and he hopes the move wont negatively impact them PERIOD

My employees have kind of invested themselves in this place  its a part of you he said PERIOD But for the most part theyre young and if things go bad theyll land on their feet. the owner said he hopes the generations of loyal customers will take solace in the fact that he plans to reopen Blimpy elsewhere PERIOD He also made a point to emphasize that he is no way angry with the University or his landlord over the move and will make every effort to make a seamless transition PERIOD

I want to keep Krazy Jims legacy going he said PERIOD

Michael Magner the son of current the Blimpy Burger owner said the news of the Universitys purchase came as a shock to him PERIOD He said though his father had the option of bidding to keep the property he couldnt match the amount that the University has reportedly offered PERIOD University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said the University could not comment on the property acquisition until the Universitys Board of Regents approves the purchase PERIOD

The University owns a parking structure on South Division and two houses on South Division and East Jefferson Streets PERIOD These properties are close to Blimpy and may suggest that the University plans to build a new structure in their place AnnArbor.com reported PERIOD It is unclear whether the University has made bids on the other buildings on the street PERIOD

LSA junior Lukose Thampy said he eats at Blimpy regularly and though hes worried about the location change he doesnt foresee that changing his eating habits PERIOD

The buildings really nice Its old it has a nice history a nice location Thampy said of the current location PERIOD Its got a nice flavor down there and I feel if it were to move down to like South Forest that would just be awful. lSA junior David Hunt said the move probably wouldnt affect whether or not he dines at Blimpy in the fall PERIOD

I enjoy the burgers Hunt said PERIOD As long as its not too far away Id still go. daily Staff Photographer Teresa Mathew contributed to this report PERIOD
