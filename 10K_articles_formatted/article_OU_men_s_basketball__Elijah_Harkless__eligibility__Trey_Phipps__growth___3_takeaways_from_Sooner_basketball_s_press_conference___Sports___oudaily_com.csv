Heres  takeaways from the press conference

Elijah Harkless expected to be immediately eligible

The NCAA Division I Council is expected to approve a waiver that will allow current rostered players immediate eligibility on Dec PERIOD  per The Athletic PERIOD

The news means that Harkless can be activated PERIOD The Cal State Northridge transfer has been awaiting confirmation on his eligibility since he announced his arrival April  PERIOD Harkless has a chance to play for OUs game against Oral Roberts barring the vote but will likely be eased into playing again PERIOD

Hell take a bit Kruger said in the press conference regarding how quickly hed be ready to play PERIOD Obviously when youre not prepared for a game its like hes preparing for his first game where weve had four under our belts PERIOD

But hes practiced great works hard PERIOD Very good feel for the game  understands whats going on clearly PERIOD So hell make adjustments as quickly as anyone could. harkless averaged . points per game with . rebounds and . assists as a sophomore in  PERIOD

Trey Phipps growing confidence

Freshman guard Trey Phipps has made the secondmost 3s on the team this season and is shooting an efficient  percent from  PERIOD

Phipps is the lone freshman on a team that starts four seniors and is averaging  minutes per game despite competing with veterans PERIOD He attributed the adjustments hes made from high school to college allowed him to play meaningful minutes off the bench for OU PERIOD

Realistically I didnt know what to expect Phipps said on how many minutes he thought he would get this season PERIOD I just had in my mind that I was gonna have to come in every day and compete PERIOD  I think a big part of me being able to get on the court early is on the defensive end PERIOD

Those adjustments its difficult PERIOD Everybodys bigger faster stronger so being able to figure out where to be on the floor and keep guys in front of you has been very important to me. defensive improvements

The Sooners lost  against Xavier on Dec PERIOD  giving up an Xavier schoolrecord  3pointers on defense PERIOD

We were just really lacking on defense as a whole rather than just one person locked in senior guard Alondes Williams said about the loss to Xavier in Mondays press conference PERIOD We need the whole team to lock in on defense so we can stop people from scoring so much. oU gave up just  points to Florida AM two days later and held them to .7percent shooting PERIOD

We can be very very good Williams said PERIOD I feel like we can go super far this season because our defense got way better than last year. success An email has been sent to  with a link to confirm list signup PERIOD
