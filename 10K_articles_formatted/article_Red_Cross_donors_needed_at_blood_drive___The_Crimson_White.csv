The Red Cross is holding a blood drive at the Ferguson Center through Thursday from noon to  p.m PERIOD

Our goal is to have as many donors as possible because of the extremely low supply of blood in the United States said Leland Manning director of the SGAs philanthropy PERIOD The Red Cross is currently in need of  donors. manning said the SGA hopes for the blood drive to bring the student body together and to realize their potential as a whole PERIOD

In a large university students rarely understand their ability to come together and make a difference Manning said PERIOD

As donors students are required to have a form of identification and answer a few simple questions to make sure their blood can be donated PERIOD

However because of the summer vacation student donors were rarely available PERIOD

Students give us  percent of blood we collect said Donna McClure Red Cross account manager for the Tuscaloosa area PERIOD With students being on summer vacation that put us in urgent serious need of blood PERIOD We are looking to collect  pints this drive. vincent Allen Red Cross team supervisor said it is important for students to understand the value of giving blood PERIOD

Nobody really understands the importance of giving blood until they need it or until a family member needs it he said PERIOD I personally did not know until three people in my family needed it and the hospital told us they did not have a donor PERIOD Thats why I come to work every day knowing what I do is needed. even students who are not able to give blood can help with the blood drive PERIOD

Almost every college student is able to give blood Manning said PERIOD If not they can always help spread the word to make just as much if not more of a difference.",Red Cross donors needed at blood drive â€“ The Crimson White,University of Alabama
