Husky Ambassadors are required to spend a semester as minglers before they can train to be full tour guides PERIOD

Minglers talk to prospective students in the Visitor Center while they wait for their admissions session and tour said Husky Ambassador Sheridan Lasher a secondyear politics philosophy and economics major PERIOD

Throughout that semester and the start of the next we train to be full tour guides PERIOD Once we have passed our certification then we must meet a tour quota by giving tours to prospective and admitted students in addition to attending meetings put on by the leadership council of Husky Ambassadors Lasher said PERIOD

The hourlong tours show prospective students a first year residence hall the student center the recreation center the research areas and the main quads on campus Lasher said PERIOD

Tours run year round and in the busy spring seasons we offer Saturday tours as well said Husky Ambassador communication chair Deirdre Dunham a fourthyear bioengineering major PERIOD

Connor Hamill a thirdyear political science major has led tours as a Husky Ambassador for a year and a half PERIOD

I find it very rewarding to help people in their college journey Hamill said PERIOD I enjoy helping people out and its also a really great way for me to sit back and reflect on just how much Ive actually accomplished during my time here at Northeastern. dunham said that leading tours is something she always knew she would do PERIOD I knew no matter where I went to college I wanted to be a tour guide because I realized what a huge impact a tour guide could have on a student in the college decision process PERIOD I joined Husky Ambassadors my freshman year and Ive gotten continually more involved and passionate about what I do. finn OBrien a high school junior from Hinesburg Vermont participated in an afternoon campus tour on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

Touring colleges is a little intimidating but its fun OBrien said PERIOD The NU tour is really good so far and has covered about everything Id be interested in. highschool junior Lara Crochik came to Boston from Cary North Carolina to tour Northeastern PERIOD

Its a really modern and cool campus Crochik said PERIOD The tour has been really good. while the tours are helpful resources for prospective students and their families some current students find them to be a nuisance PERIOD Thia Fowler a firstyear marine biology major said she understands the necessity of the tours but finds them annoying PERIOD

I have a class in the lecture hall beneath the welcome center and its often a hassle to get through the congregated mass of highschool prospects and parents Fowler said PERIOD

Lasher said that as a tour guide she has heard that students living in Stetson East find it inconvenient that we take the tours through there. other students are not impacted at all by the presence of tour groups  some even enjoy seeing them PERIOD

Its cool seeing people interested in the school you go to firstyear environmental science major Paul Cirillo said PERIOD

Madeline Desnoyers a thirdyear design major finds it nice to know people are interested. margot Kohler a firstyear journalism major said that she and her friends have made a game of spotting the tour groups PERIOD
