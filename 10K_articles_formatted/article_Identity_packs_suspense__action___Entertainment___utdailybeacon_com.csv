He began as the weapon and became the target PERIOD

In The Bourne Identity Jason Bourne Matt Damon is a CIA agent who does not know what he does or who he really is PERIOD Throughout the course of the movie he is taken on a journey through Europe where he learns about himself PERIOD

The movie begins with a fishing boat at sea that finds what the crew presumes is a dead scuba diver PERIOD The man is pulled aboard the boat and taken below deck PERIOD He awakens soon thereafter but does not know who he is and assumes he has amnesia PERIOD

Eventually the man whose name is actually Jason makes his way to Zurich Switzerland to a bank where he finds answers to his past PERIOD Confused about what he has learned he goes to the United States Embassy where after some confrontation he meets up with Marie Kreutz Franka Potente PERIOD

He offers to pay Marie to drive him to Paris PERIOD Upon their arrival to Paris the United States authorities who have now become Jasons enemies are scheming a plan to take him out PERIOD

After a fight with an attacker Jason and Marie lead Paris authorities on one of the most impressive car chases to date PERIOD Once it ends they decide they must stay together to elude those pursuing them PERIOD

The plot moves forward as Jason begins to understand his former life continues to outmaneuver his enemy and becomes closer to Marie PERIOD

This actionmystery thriller keeps the audience on the edge of their seats as Jason and Marie move from place to place assembling the pieces of the puzzle that is Jasons life PERIOD

Damons acting is improving PERIOD The action scenes between he and his assailants are good considering this is one of Damons first fight scene movies PERIOD Damons costar Potente makes a good love interest and sidekick PERIOD

The disappointing aspect of the movie is that Julia Stiles does not have a bigger part PERIOD She plays a type of relay person for CIA headquarters in Paris but could have held down a more important role PERIOD

As a whole Identity is a movie packed with enough action and suspense to keep the audience asking themselves what is going to happen next PERIOD It is one of Damons best performances not to mention the fact that he is playing a part he is not accustomed to PERIOD

Moviegoers who enjoy action mystery and suspense will enjoy the intrigue of Identity PERIOD
