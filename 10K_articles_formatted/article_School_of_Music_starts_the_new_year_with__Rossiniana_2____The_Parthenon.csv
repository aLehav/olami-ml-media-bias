We try to schedule our performances on campus at the beginnings of semesters that way we leave available dates in the semester for students recitals and ensembles Wendell Dobbs one of the two members of Violauta Duo said PERIOD

Dobbs said the Violauta Duo has performed many many times on campus but as of right now has no plans to play on campus again this semester PERIOD

Rossiniana is an expression from the nineteenth century guitarist Mauro Giuliana to honor the worldrenowned opera composer Gioachino Rossini PERIOD Rossinis music was popular across Europe and in the young United States of America during his lifetime PERIOD Other composers began to create new works based on his to honor Rossinis life PERIOD

Two such composer and performers other than Giuliani were flutist JeanLouis Tulou and guitarist Ferdinando Carulli important figures in the musical fabric of Paris in the early nineteenth century Dobbs said PERIOD Acknowledging the importance of Rossinis music they created arrangements for flute and guitar of a halfdozen of Rossinis most famous opera arias. the Violauta Duo will perform three of the arrangements on Thursday in addition to a sonata by the guitarist Mauro Giuliana and another serenade by Carulli PERIOD

Our first Rossiniana performance last September filled our Studio  in Smith Music Hall Dobbs said PERIOD We hope for a similar turnout. the Violauta Duo has been performing for a little over  years PERIOD Members Wendell Dobbs and Jlio Ribeiro Alves began performing together shortly after Alves arrived at Marshall PERIOD Dobbs and Alves are both faculty members for the School of Music PERIOD Part of the reason they formed the duo is that there is a large selection of music composed for flute and guitar PERIOD

This Sunday they will be playing the same program at the Ariel Theater in Gallipolis Ohio at  p.m PERIOD They will then travel to Reston Virginia on Feb PERIOD  to perform at the Flute Society of Washingtons MidAtlantic Flute Fair PERIOD
