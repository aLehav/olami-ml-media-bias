The more you do the more you need to do Associated Students of the University of Utah President Spencer Pearson said PERIOD You have to constantly look back to what population you are serving and how to benefit them. although the chairs in the Union Ballroom were mostly filled with student leaders Pearson said all students should hold ASUU accountable by asking it how it is meeting their needs and how it is building on existing programs PERIOD

With a largely academic focus the  administration said its top accomplishments were the Graduation Guarantee advising plan achieving taxfree status for college textbooks statewide implementing a student fee for an expanded study abroad program and increasing funding for Supplemental Instruction PERIOD

We wanted to do things that have potential to impact every student on campus ASUU Vice President Basim Motiwala said PERIOD Every student comes here for an education. through the Graduation Guarantee a plan that pushes students toward graduation in no more than fiveandahalf years through regular academic advising students map out a course schedule to graduation PERIOD Students sign a contract agreeing to follow the plan which can be revised or updated and by following it they are guaranteed class availability in the courses they need or else the colleges are required to revise the contract provide an alternate course waive the requirement or waive the tuition or fees that students would have spent on the course PERIOD Students will also be encouraged to meet with career counselors to look into job and internship opportunities PERIOD

All colleges have agreed to adopt the plan which will be implemented in the fall PERIOD ASUU will present the plan to the State Board of Regents next week PERIOD

To remind students that the plan was a student initiative it will be called the ASUU Graduation Guarantee and students will be able to give continued input through an implementation committee PERIOD

This plan will be the legacy of this administration said Katie Miller director of the ASUU Academic Affairs Board PERIOD

To lessen the financial burdens of a college education ASUU led a statewide initiative to remove sales tax from college textbooks PERIOD By working with all Utah institutions of higher education the Utah State Tax Commission and state legislators it was able to change the tax code to make textbooks exempt PERIOD As of April  textbooks in the University Campus Store are taxfree which ASUU says will save students an average of  on textbooks every semester and add up to a total of . million in savings for all Utah students annually PERIOD

ASUU legislative bodies approved a  fee increase to subsidize study abroad or international internships and service opportunities which will be matched by  from the U administration to create an endowment for study abroad PERIOD Pearson said ASUU is now looking at ways to allocate funds and work with departments to build programs abroad which he said will make students and the university more competitive PERIOD

By increasing funding for the Supplemental Instruction program ASUU will help the program carry three more courses each year PERIOD Through the program students can participate in organized study groups led by trained undergraduates PERIOD

Senior Class President Nicole Nguyen praised her board for choosing a senior class gift that is implemented before seniors graduate which has not been the pattern in the past PERIOD ASUU contributed  and the Senior Class Council is fundraising  to replace the playground at the ASUU Childcare Center outside the Alfred Emery Building which will be dedicated April  PERIOD
