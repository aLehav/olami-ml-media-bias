8911,2019-11-07,"after a thrilling  season that culminated in an appearance in the NCAA DIII Mens Basketball Championship Swarthmore Mens Basketball gears up for their first official game versus Eastern College this Saturday PERIOD Last season the team reached many milestones PERIOD They broke the Swarthmore Mens Basketball record for the most wins in a season earning  wins and only four losses resulting in their first NCAA Championship appearance in program history PERIOD

The team enters the  season ranked first in the country beating out their NCAA Championship opponent University of WisconsinOshkosh for the top spot PERIOD The Garnet boasts an impressive group of twelve returning players and six new first years PERIOD

The team graduated two seniors including AllAmerican Cam Wiley  who was the teams top point scorer averaging . points a game PERIOD Wiley was also a key playmaker recording an astounding  assists last year the most in program history for a single season PERIOD Despite the loss of Wiley Swarthmore will return four of their five top scorers including captains Conor Harkins  Zac ODell  and Nate Shafer  to fill Wileys role PERIOD Harkins ODell and Shafer all received Centennial Conference honors including ODells Centennial Conference Defensive Player of the Year PERIOD

With the unparalleled success of last year and the return of many key players the team is expected to perform at the highest level PERIOD

Our team will probably have a lot of expectations from everyone but I think we do a great job of just zoning those expectations out and focusing on what we can control every day in practice and in games said Harkins.Last season was great and a huge success but we know that this year will be different and bring on different challenges that we will have to face. coach Landry Kosmalski echoed Harkins confidence in the teams ability to focus and perform PERIOD

Fortunately we have always focused on our own standards rather than on the expectations that other people have for us said Kosmalski PERIOD We hold each other accountable to our standards every day and as long as we stay consistent with that outside expectations shouldnt affect us. a core aspect to the teams success is their dedication to not only the sport but to each other PERIOD There is a strong team culture that is supportive but demands the best of every player on the roster PERIOD

This year like last year we have a really close group of guys who hold each other accountable and I think when you have that sort of bond within a team it makes the entire process much more fun and rewarding said Abass Sallah  PERIOD

George Visconti  one of the returning top five scorers emphasized the players desire to give it their all no matter what form their contribution to the team took PERIOD

I want to execute my role on the team to the best of abilities so I can give my team the best chance to go as far as we possibly can said Visconti PERIOD

The incorporation of six freshmen into the Garnets roster will be essential to their success and the upperclassmen have taken on the responsibility to help the firstyears transition to collegiate basketball PERIOD

It is very hard for the freshmen to get acclimated into our system and it just means that the upperclassmen have to help them out even more at the beginning of the year Harkins PERIOD

Thus far Coach Kosmalski has been impressed with the freshmens progress PERIOD

We have a big class of six firstyear players and they are all learning rapidly and improving daily said Coach Kosmalski PERIOD

Swarthmore Mens Basketball prepares for a long season no doubt filled with lots of great games in Tarble Pavilion including intense conference play against rival Johns Hopkins PERIOD The teams zeal for the upcoming games is apparent and Saturdays game versus Eastern will provide their first test PERIOD

For me the most exciting part about this upcoming season is the chance to get to compete every day with a group of guys that I love said Sallah PERIOD
