Im really excited PERIOD Im trying not to think so much about it said Gaby Betancourt a member of the team and a senior international business major PERIOD Its a big contest and when we get there its going to be hard not to notice all the people. there are numerous age categories at the National Championships PERIOD However FAU surfers are only competing in the collegiate category and they expect to do well PERIOD

If we go out there and only a couple people are happy with how the conditions are then its up in the air said Andrew Fletcher president of the FAU Surf Club PERIOD But if everyone goes out there and does a really great job and is having a good time and the waves are fun for them then we may take first place. however it has not always been fun and games for the FAU Surf Club PERIOD The team had its fair share of difficulty in making it to the National Championships PERIOD

According to Fletcher FAU only funds one trip per semester which forced the club to pay its own way for the season contests in the hopes that it could advance to the Nationals PERIOD

We paid everything out of pocket PERIOD The school didnt help us at all with any funding throughout the semester PERIOD We paid for all the contests entry fees which were about  a person and we paid for gas and food said Fletcher PERIOD However they are being very helpful with the Nationals trip so its paying off for us. the Surf Club also had a long road to travel to make it to Nationals in the competitive sense PERIOD Matched up against teams like UF which have more support from their alumni and outside sponsorships it has been tough for FAU to pull together a team with the drive to succeed especially without support from the home crowd PERIOD

A lot of these schools have full sponsorships said Fletcher PERIOD Like UNCWilmington is fully sponsored by Quiksilver PERIOD They take the team seriously and help organize. at the collegiate level in the NSSA there are two regions the West Coast and the East Coast PERIOD Each region has a regular season that requires teams to attend at least three of the six contests offered by the NSSA PERIOD If the requirement is met and the team places well they are invited to their Regional Championships PERIOD The top teams from the Regional Championships qualify for the National Championships PERIOD Ultimately  teams are invited PERIOD

I think well do well PERIOD I know that none of us have ever been to NSSA National Championships so that will be a first for all of us said Gaby Betancourt PERIOD Some of us dont have that much experience but I think this big contest in California will better all of our surfing and it will be fun. interested in the FAU Surf Club

The FAU Surf Club is open to anyone but a form of tryouts does happen for the competing team PERIOD According to Surf Club President Andrew Fletcher he asks potential team members to attend monthly meetings and to surf with the team so he can see their level of commitment to the sport PERIOD He also said the club is basically a way for people on campus to meet other people who are interested in surfing.For more info join the Florida Atlantic University Surf Club Facebook group PERIOD
