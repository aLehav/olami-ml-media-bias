Then in minute  of the match Ramos was able to capitalize on a foul inside the box for a penalty shot to regain the lead  over Riverside PERIOD

The lead wouldnt last long again as the Highlanders with time running out in the match got the ball past Escalante by a header from Hayden Leslie off of a free kick from Gonzalez to tie the game up at  and send it into overtime PERIOD

Riversides Gonzalez finished the game with two assists while the Titans Escalante finished the game with two saves PERIOD

Then the Titans kept control of the match in overtime as they outshot and overpowered Riverside with a  advantage on shots in overtime  overall and their precision paid off when Blanco scored the game winner in minute  of the match when the Highlanders tried to clear the ball out of danger but it went right to the Titans Mark Vasquez who sent it back in for Blanco who put it past Khosravi to end it PERIOD
