Alexander explained that as a result of an economic shift toward deindustrialization in the 1950s many bluecollar industrial jobs were lost and this resulted in a surplus of jobless black males PERIOD

We could have responded to this collapse with compassion care job training and economic stimulus she said PERIOD We chose a different roadof division punitiveness and despair PERIOD We ended the War on Poverty and declared the War on Drugs. that new policy approach according to Alexander systemically targets black males for incarceration PERIOD

She said she first discovered the nature of the system while working at the ACLU in North Carolina PERIOD She met a man who told Alexander that the police had planted drugs on him PERIOD Unable to defend the man because he had a felony record Alexander said It was then that the light bulb went off and Alexander came to the conclusion that black males face higher rates of higher incarceration as a result of what she sees as deeprooted racist practices PERIOD

Alexander localized the issues that she presented in her talk noting If you count prisoners as people in the Chicago area nearly  percent of African American men have criminal records. she cited that incarceration rates have quintupled in the last  years while crime rates have decreased PERIOD She claimed that this is due to the War on Drugs which has been waged exclusively in communities of color. it is a system that locks poor people into a permanent second class PERIOD This new system is the moral equivalent of Jim Crow she said PERIOD
