Dr PERIOD Robert J PERIOD Sternberg a Yale professor of  years and an expert on intelligence testing spoke on what makes people smart and why last night Kane Hall PERIOD

John Brandford of the School of Education introduced Sternberg as  because of his more than  publications and his editing and authoring of more than  books PERIOD

He focused on how much institutionalized intelligence testing  testing based primarily on reaction time and memorization  really measured intelligence PERIOD His first point was to draw the difference between practical and academic intelligence PERIOD

 Sternberg said PERIOD

The main examples provided for his assessment of the institutionalized method of testing came through cultural studies done in Kenya Tanzania Zambia Taiwan Alaska and other parts of the United States PERIOD

He said a problem surrounding standardized testing in most of these countries was the constant presence of intestinal parasites in  percent of the rural children PERIOD While the initial testing showed rural children doing poorly in comparison to their urban or wealthier counterparts after the application of antiparasitic drugs the treated children improved in many cases to overtake their counterparts in intelligence tests PERIOD These results have led nations to provide antiparasitic medicines for their affected populations PERIOD

 Sternberg said PERIOD

Sternberg added 

In the United States intelligence is generally seen as a combination of problemsolving ability verbal confidence and personal competence according to Sternberg PERIOD While this definition appears broad other countries like Taiwan and Kenya have much broader definitions of intelligence and these definitions differ greatly from the U.S PERIOD definition PERIOD

 Sternberg said PERIOD

What Sternberg devised was a definition of intelligence generally shown in successful people PERIOD The combination of strengths in analytical creative and utilitarian thinking are what he calls his triarchic aspects of intelligence PERIOD

According to Sternberg by catering to the cultural and practical side of a persons knowledge one can learn more effectively than the more traditional approach of learning and testing on memorization PERIOD

He said instituting these principles may take some time in the United States PERIOD According to Sternberg the entrenched system of memorization learning and testing will take time to replace due to a mindset based in the traditional definition of intelligence among institutions PERIOD

With studies conducted in the United States that added creative and practical additions to the SATs  that doubled the ability to predict freshman college grades  he hopes the triarchic approach to testing and teaching is not too far off in the future PERIOD
