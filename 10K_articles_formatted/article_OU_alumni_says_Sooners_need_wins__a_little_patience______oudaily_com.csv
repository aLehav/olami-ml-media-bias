4985,1970-01-01,"oU head football coach John Blake has big shoes to fill.What the Sooner football program needs most right is a few wins and fans with patienceJohn Blake is in his second season with a three and nine coaching record and despite being fore warned for some rough times many Sooner fans are howling for a change PERIOD They are not in the majority yet but are growing in numbers that could be strong enough to make some noise by the end of the year.Welcome to Sooner football of the nineties PERIOD An era where most fans expect performance reminiscent of the 70s when Barry and the boys were running over college football as if they owned the game PERIOD In fact OU did own college football whether the Joe Paternos of the world like it or not.Unfortunately its Switzers spectacular legacy that is causing Blake so many problems PERIOD Gary Gibbs Howard Schnellenberger and now Blake have all worked to fill those huge shoes of arguably the greatest college football coach of all time PERIOD Coming off probation restricted to only  recruits a year and the pressure of feeding the monster that is OU football is a tough chore especially in a new era of college football.Blake understood what he was getting into when he left the World Champion Dallas Cowboys as an assistant coach to take over his beloved Sooners.Blake grew up in Sand Springs with crimson and cream in his blood and a love in his heart for the Sooners PERIOD He left some of that blood on the turf at Owen Field as a starting nose guard and set a goal one day to return to be the head coach at OU.After the Schnellenberger firing Blake was an overwhelming choice of the OU search committee and fans alike to direct the Sooner program PERIOD Blake was the only coach the search committee interviewed and on WWLSRadio the call for Blake was so loud that if any other coach had been hired you would have had a riot in Norman.Schnellenberger had splintered the Sooner family alienating former players coaches and alums PERIOD Granted Schnellenberger was a fine promoter selling out OUs Memorial Stadium three times during his . season of  but he burned so many bridges in the process he had to go.Blake was hired to come in and pick up the pieces PERIOD A master recruiter as an assistant at OU and Tulsa Blake laid out and explained a game plan to the Sooner faithful that would one day regain the Sooner glory PERIOD Anybody close to the situation knew the Sooners had yet to rock bottom but would have to do so first before the new climb to the top could begin.That happened in  when the Sooners flopped to  PERIOD It was a tough transition year for Blake as his Sooners never got consistent quarterback play for his new offense PERIOD His defense was left on the field to long and gave up big plays in the passing game early PERIOD And his special teams were the worst in college football.However Blake never said his job was going to be easy PERIOD He has never said he would win a national championship in his second year PERIOD In fact he never promised he could have a winning record in his second year.Blake has been brutally honest in his evaluation of the Sooners and said it will take five years to rebuild the Sooner program to the point its a conference and national contender again PERIOD He has said from day one and still says it today PERIOD Is anybody listeningSooner fans be patient Despite Blakes early record his team is making progress PERIOD Recruiting went well the first two years and will get better.Sooner players finally have been around the same offensive defensive coordinators for two consecutive years.hello there  you too
