Matching up in its third nonconference contest of the season the AP Top  poll No PERIOD  Marshall Thundering Herd football team   will face off Saturday against the UMass Minutemen  in Joan C PERIOD Edwards Stadium PERIOD

For the second game in a row Marshall will face a team who is playing only its second game of the season PERIOD

In a situation where you do not know much about your opponent the best thing to do is focus on yourself Head Coach Doc Holliday said PERIOD Weve got a standard that we have to play up to. in the Minutemens lone game of the season they were throttled  by Georgia Southern PERIOD Because Georgia Southern ran an option offense the film on UMasss defense is not necessarily applicable to what it will look like against the Herd PERIOD

Thus in order to understand the breadth of the Minutemens schemes the staff has had to watch film of other teams of which current UMass assistant coaches previously coached Holiday said PERIOD

But ultimately Holliday said it comes down to being able to make adjustments early in the game on both sides of the ball PERIOD The experience laden Marshall offensive line will play a key role in making some of those adjustments he said PERIOD

Sticking with the offensive side of the ball Holliday said that the receiving core will have all its guys back in the lineup with the exception of sophomore Broc Thompson PERIOD

Both redshirt senior Artie Henry and redshirt sophomore Corey Gammage stepped up in relief for a banged up wide receiver position combining for  receiving yards and three touchdowns in the last two games PERIOD

The Herd offense has produced a fairly balanced attack so far this season averaging  yards on the ground and  yards through the air PERIOD

On the other hand the Minutemen offense struggled in its lone game against Georgia Southern totaling only  yards of offense PERIOD

Last season UMass was No PERIOD  in the country in points scored and No PERIOD  in total yards PERIOD But as Holiday said the Minuteman totally revamped their roster from a season ago PERIOD

The players are all totally different Holliday said PERIOD And then from a personnel standpoint theyre a lot better than they were a year ago. redshirt senior offensive lineman Alex Mollette said that the Minutemen are a big and physical team that likes to play sound defense PERIOD

Theyve got some bug dudes on that defense Mollette said PERIOD Were going to have to bring what we have to the plate PERIOD But we like to hang our hat on being physical as well. uMass was not a team on Marshalls original schedule PERIOD They were added to the docket on Oct PERIOD  expanding the Herds schedule to nine games PERIOD

Because last weekends matchup with the Florida International Panthers was postponed due to COVID19 complications within FIUs program the total number of games on the Herds schedule decreased back to eight PERIOD

Weve got to control what we can control Holliday said PERIOD Unfortunately the FIU game was canceled PERIOD Fortunately for us were excited that UMass is coming to town and that we have another game. with just two home conference matchups left Marshall has no away contests remaining as the schedule currently stands PERIOD

But that could change with the possible rescheduling of lost away games like Rice East Carolina or FIU PERIOD There are two weekends open for any of those three to be rescheduled the weekends of Dec PERIOD  and Dec PERIOD  PERIOD The conference championship is scheduled for the following weekend on Friday Dec PERIOD  PERIOD

As an independent UMass originally postponed its season but announced on Sep PERIOD  that it would play football in the fall PERIOD Currently the Minutemen have three total games on its  schedule PERIOD The third game is scheduled for Friday Nov PERIOD  against Liberty PERIOD

This Saturdays game is slated to kick off at  p.m PERIOD and will be televised on ESPN PERIOD It will also be broadcast on WMULFM . the student voice of Thundering Herd athletics PERIOD
