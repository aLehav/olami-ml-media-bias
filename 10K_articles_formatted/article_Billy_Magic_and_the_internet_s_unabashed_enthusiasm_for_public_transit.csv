One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

Americans only love the college experience because its the only time in their lives they live in a walkable community reads a viral January  tweet PERIOD Ann Arbor fits the bill hosting most campus buildings and housing within about a onemile radius and offering free transit to students PERIOD Ive always found pleasure in proximity PERIOD

I like to imagine the buildings on campus opened up like Richard Scarry books to allow peeks into what goes on PERIOD Scientists bait lab rats a short walk from where swimmers count down to the Olympics a step away from where a mother delivers a baby a hallway across from where a loved one is lost to an incurable disease PERIOD Elementary schoolers learn addition a block from where frat brothers play daytime pong a worldclass map collection sits steps away from the spot where I once laughed so hard that coffee came out of my nose PERIOD

In a dense area like Ann Arbor the marvelous and the mundane are neighbors and you can catch peeks of them from the windows of the Blue Bus PERIOD What a joy it is to get around PERIOD

Luckily Im not alone in my love for transportation PERIOD Bus sentiment varies but a community of halfserious transit enthusiasts has risen up around an eminently memeable transportation guru named Billy Magic PERIOD

Residing among University of Michigan meme royalty like Reggie Bee and Big Flappo Billy Magic has become an integral figure of freshman orientation in the nine years since the Michigan Transportation Musical was created PERIOD Breaking the fourth wall Billy Magic looks straight into the eyes of the eighteenyearolds packed into lecture halls and preaches a gospel of new urbanism PERIOD

The masses need to know that safe ride offers a variety of free and lowcost options for a ride home Magic says PERIOD

With its slightly censorious cheerfulness and everchanging ratio of irony and sincerity the video has built a cultlike obsession for the campuss decidedly unsexy fleet of blue diesel buses PERIOD How did this happen

Baby you can drive my bus

I tracked down the writer behind the 12minute musical a Brooklynbased director and socialimpact storyteller named Emily Lyon PERIOD When I asked how the character of Billy Magic was born she responded carefully PERIOD

I was staring at a blank page and realized that my script about the magic bus needed a guide Lyon told me over the phone PERIOD And then Billy Magic just came to me. she paused deliberating PERIOD

I cant attribute it to anything except  inspiration from the gods Lyon said PERIOD

The former Music Theatre  Dance student had made informational PSAstyle videos for the University before with a studentrun production company called Filmic but no project had been this big PERIOD Tasked with replacing the previous transportation video Lyon knew she wanted to use humor PERIOD

She felt an obligation to preserve the endearing cringeworthiness of the videos precursor a latenineties production that was memorable for its lack of selfawareness PERIOD Lyon described it as a runofthemill PSA video

But sort of dramatic like D.A.R.E she said PERIOD I loved it. with that in mind she and a team from Filmic let goofy ideas fly PERIOD

We were aware that this was a ridiculous topic and our audience is teenagers who are dubious of content  we decided to play into it Lyon said PERIOD Few people show up to orientation thinking You know what I want to talk about Buses  Except maybe Billy Magic. the videos three days of filming were chockfull of improvisation PERIOD Boundaries were pushed PERIOD

We had a lot of fun with it  a lot recounted Lyon PERIOD

Others agreed including costar Nick Skardarasy PERIOD I called him on the phone to discuss his reflections on the project nearly nine years after he costarred as a kid  The Kid according to the credits  to whom Billy Magic explained campus transportation PERIOD Skardarasy told me that the team had a good time PERIOD

He also hinted that some scenes were cut on account of their suggestive content PERIOD One of those deleted scenes stuck with him for nearly ten years and though he couldnt tell me exactly what it was he disclosed that it implied a sexual relationship between Billy and a bus PERIOD

As a creator Lyon still has a knack for using humor to make dry but important topics palatable PERIOD I asked her what PSAs should be revamped to be funny and her immediate response was all of them. specifically shed like to see more jokes and gags in Terms and Conditions the average Americans digital contracts would take  hours to read PERIOD

One of my favorite quotes is this Laughter is the sound of recognition meaning that an audience that laughs is still with you Lyon explained PERIOD

Meme page fame

Theres a contagiousness to Billy Magics pure and uncomplicated adoration for buses that catapulted the video to meme fame almost immediately PERIOD Skardarasy recalls freshmen pointing at him and approaching him after the videos first showing in fall  nearly eight years later C.J PERIOD Eldred who played Billy was repeatedly asked to sign autographs on the Diag during a recent visit PERIOD Borderline evangelical zeal for the short film continues to this day PERIOD

In the poll the Facebook group UMich Memes for Wolverteens used to determine its official endorsement for  Democratic nominee for president Billy Magic got . of the vote coming in third place only behind Reggie Bee and Bernie Sanders PERIOD He later appeared in a meme captioned AND WITH  OF PRECINCTS REPORTING BILLY MAGIC HAS WON THE  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION Meme page admin Zachary Wernet made the short film its own IMDB page PERIOD A Billy Magic design for wall art in Animal Crossing got over  likes PERIOD Seniors get graduation photos in front of Mbuses in honor of the video and the team behind the video even reunited to speak at the virtual  graduation PERIOD A quirky 12minute informational video has made buses of all things inexplicably cool for almost ten years PERIOD

Over the phone Lucas Renno renowned admin of UMich Memes for Wolverteens recounted to me his first impression of Billy Magic PERIOD

I remember sitting turning to the girl next to me in the auditorium and saying What the hell did I just watch Renno told me PERIOD

In his opinion the Michigan Transportation Musical is great because it tries just hard enough PERIOD

Too many big institutions try too hard Renno said PERIOD They make communications that are obviously intended to be funny or hip with the youths and they fall flat on their face PERIOD Its clear from the beginning that this video was written and directed by students rather than school bureaucrats. planes trains not automobiles

The Michigan Transportation Musical isnt the only corner of the internet where deliberately overthetop enthusiasm for public transportation runs free PERIOD Theres a wildly popular Facebook group called New Urbanist Memes for Transit Oriented Teens NUMTOT for short in which hundreds of thousands of members share their passion for highdensity housing bike lanes parks trains and other urbanist ideals PERIOD

Every day the group is filled with halfserious posts like Nascar is cancelled PERIOD I want to see public buses celebrated and raced Another recent post shows a trolley problem meme with an empty set of tracks captioned There is no trolley PERIOD America killed it in the mid20th century in favor of suburban sprawl and the personal automobile. underneath layers of ironic stan lingo is a genuine passion for sustainable humancentric urban planning PERIOD Its all a meme but no one is joking PERIOD

The group is built on a scaffolding of disappointment  a shared longing for a world in which federal subsidies in the form of highways and suburban housing had not fractured postwar public life into suburbs of sequestered private residences PERIOD The NUMTOT ideology criticizes the glut of motor vehicles infesting modern cities mourning the walkability that could have been PERIOD This truth  that were living in a cartastrophe  is the root of every joke PERIOD Humorous posts about concepts like the North American lawn fetish and regular bouts of shaming NIMBYs are memeified versions of wellsubstantiated social commentaries PERIOD

I became a NUMTOT pressed join on a Facebook group around the time I first watched The Michigan Transportation Musical at orientation PERIOD Coming off of a gap year living in Chicago I had neither a car nor a care in the world PERIOD That year I gained confidence biking in cities I acquired an elegant command of the subway and I grew to hate the way rideshare apps clogged the alreadycongested streets in Manhattan rideshare app drivers spend  of their time idling between customers PERIOD A Facebook community gave me the nudge I needed to spin my private adoration of buses and trains into bona fide advocacy PERIOD

Both NUMTOT and the Michigan Transportation musical build an online cult around the otherwise lame topic of transit PERIOD That enthusiasm may prove essential as President Bidens  trillion infrastructure plan is debated in Congress where lawmakers from suburban and rural districts often prefer money for roads PERIOD Biden a longtime Amtrak rider wants to spend  billion over eight years to help local governments invest in mass transit systems so that driving doesnt have to be the default PERIOD

For a specific demographic of veryonline young people garnering broad political support for mass transit might take on an interesting form PERIOD To make an impact the messaging may involve a precise genre of satire one that conveys that the poster is definitely kidding but totally serious PERIOD
