Entering this season coach Elaine Jones set a goal for the team to improve upon its overall record PERIOD

Its safe to say the Aggies accomplished this goal PERIOD

UC Davis wrapped up its season with  victories an improvement of five wins from last season PERIOD It was also the Aggies best season since  PERIOD Jones attributed the turnaround to the lack of captains on this years squad PERIOD

Collective leadership was the biggest key to our success this year Jones said PERIOD Im very proud of the team and how it played over the course of the year. the Aggies went  at last weekends Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships finishing tied for third in the conference PERIOD Junior Gina Hoffmire finished the season with  goals the team lead PERIOD

Thursday  UC Davis  Oregon 

At last years MPSF Championships the Aggies came in as the fifth seed and upset the fourth seed Denver PERIOD

UC Davis must have had dj vu PERIOD

After falling to Oregon just two weeks prior the Aggies topped the fourth seeded Ducks for the first round upset PERIOD

Im really proud of the teams effort against Oregon Jones said PERIOD We had to come back on multiple occasions and the team showed great mental toughness PERIOD It was amazing. oregon jumped out to a  lead after the opening whistle and went into halftime with a  advantage PERIOD

Both teams traded goals in the second half before the Aggies scored five unanswered to secure the  upset PERIOD

Oregon even played better than it did the first time we played this season Jones said PERIOD We are just the better team. junior attacker Christina Corsa had a career game scoring five goals en route to the victory PERIOD Hoffmire added four scores for her eighth hattrick of the season PERIOD

Friday  No PERIOD  Denver  UC Davis 

The Aggies season had to end eventually PERIOD What better way than to the top seeded team in the tournament PERIOD

After falling into a threegoal deficit the UC Davis crept back to make it a onegoal game with  minutes left in the first period PERIOD The Pioneers however scored five of the next six goals to close out the half with a  lead PERIOD The two teams traded scores in the second half as the Pioneers cruised to the victory PERIOD

We played Denver a lot better this time around Jones said PERIOD We had our chances to take the lead but we just didnt finish our shots when we had the momentum PERIOD It was still a good effort all around. junior goalie Alyssa Cranska had a season best  saves against  Denver shots PERIOD Senior Molly Lapolla led the Aggies with three goals in her UC Davis finale PERIOD

Jones said she expects bigger and better things out of her team next year PERIOD

I really enjoyed coaching this years team and Im pleased with the progress they made Jones said PERIOD I always think theres room to improve however. jASON ALPERT can be reached at sportstheaggie.org PERIOD
