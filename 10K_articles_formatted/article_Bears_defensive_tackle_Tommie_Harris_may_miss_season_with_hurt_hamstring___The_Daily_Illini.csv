Losing Harris could be a major blow to the leagues topranked defense because of his quickness and strength PERIOD The Bears firstround draft pick in  out of Oklahoma the 6foot3 295pound Harris has five sacks this season and   in his short career PERIOD Hes often been doubleteamed this season PERIOD

No one else in the league has a player like Tommie Harris Smith said PERIOD Now I see us being like everyone else PERIOD Everyone else has played without a dominant player like that PERIOD Does it change the dynamics of our team the defensive line Yes for sure. the Bears likely will turn to Ian Scott with Alfonso Boone and Antonio Garay as backups PERIOD Tank Johnson has been the starter alongside Harris PERIOD
