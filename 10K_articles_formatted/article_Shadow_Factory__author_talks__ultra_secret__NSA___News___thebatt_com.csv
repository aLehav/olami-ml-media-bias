James Bamford author of The Shadow Factory began writing about National Security Agency in the 1980s PERIOD

Bamford who spoke Monday night at the Annenberg Presidential Conference Center was this years Common Ground Reading Initiative author and speaker for the College of Liberal Arts PERIOD

Bamford said he and the NSA have a somewhat mutual coexistence PERIOD

I dont write to make the NSA happy Bamford said PERIOD I write what I see PERIOD Its a lovehate relationship PERIOD I sort of love them and they sort of hate me. during the lecture Bamford mentioned his past writings all covering the topic of U.S PERIOD intelligence along with his most recent cover stories including his indepth interview with National Security Agency information leaker Edward Snowden PERIOD Bamford spent three days in Moscow Russia speaking to the former CIA system administrator PERIOD

Tranae Felicien political science freshman said Bamford speaking about his recent interaction with Snowden sparked her curiosity PERIOD

Thats really impressive that he spent three days with him  you get to really see the insight Felicien said PERIOD Weve heard what everyone else says but we havent really heard from Snowden himself. condensing the basics of the NSA into an hour and fifteen minutes Bamford covered topics ranging from the details of satellite microwave and undersea cable communication that the NSA uses to commenting on the general goals of the NSA PERIOD

Is there too much hay to actually find the needles The whole idea is to get all the information that we can and sometimes I think its too much Bamford said PERIOD

When choosing The Shadow Factory as this years Common Ground book Steven Oberhelman interim associate dean for Undergraduate Programs in the College of Liberal Arts said he wanted students to think outside the box PERIOD

We chose a book that we believe is intellectually challenging but is also interesting and of timely importance Oberhelman said PERIOD

The Common Ground began in  and is a freshmen reading and seminar program which gives Liberal Arts freshmen a shared reading experience PERIOD

Sherry Higginbotham administrative coordinator for the Office of the Dean of Liberal Arts said the program was created to welcome freshmen into the liberal arts college with a sense of unity PERIOD

The program is to create a sense of community among freshmen Higginbotham said PERIOD The book is chosen keeping the appeal to the audience in mind and to introduce them to subjects they might not know that much about  to not tell them what to think about it but to inform them. this year the discussion covered a topic that Oberhelman hopes encouraged students to pose thought provoking and even controversial questions about individual privacy and the need for a country to keep itself safe from attack PERIOD

This is a campus where a number of people are conservative and we quite rightly recognize that there are dangers to the country Oberhelman said PERIOD Its a great discussion to be had and not only liberal arts students but students in general can benefit from it. freshman international studies major Rebecca Matlock said she found Bamfords opinion intriguing

I thought it was really interesting when he spoke about the Iraq war and just how his view on what should have happened was so straight forward Matlock said PERIOD

Higginbotham said the Common Ground program is planning a change for next year when a committee of people will select the book providing more input from other departments in the college PERIOD

Author James Bamford discusses his book Monday to a Bush School audience PERIOD
