It is still unknown whether center Greg Monroe will enter the NBA draft or return for his junior season but either way the Hoyas have bolstered their frontcourt depth for next season PERIOD According to The Washington Post the Hoyas received a commitment from 6foot9 power forward Moses Abraham originally from Kano Nigeria PERIOD

Progressive Christian basketball player Moses Abraham a 6foot9 forward in the Class of  orally committed Thursday to play for Georgetown the Post reported PERIOD Abraham arrived in the United States last November and had been recruited by Indiana Maryland Tennessee and UCLA among others PERIOD Abraham made a twoday official visit to Indiana earlier this week after which Joe Boncore Abrahams adviser had what he called a long talk with Georgetown Coach John Thompson III and former Georgetown Coach John Thompson II PERIOD Following that discussion Abraham chose to commit to the Hoyas. abraham a local athlete who plays AAU ball for the DC Assault is a fourstar recruit according to Rivals.com and a threestar recruit according to Scout.com PERIOD He will join three other recruits in the Georgetown Class of   6foot8 227pound power forward Nate Lubick 6foot 157pound point guard Markel Starks and 6foot5 180pound small forward Aaron Bowen PERIOD

While Thompson has not brought in any McDonalds AllAmericans or particularly big names the Hoyas should enjoy more quality depth up and down the roster in  than they did this season which ended in a  loss to No PERIOD  seed Ohio in the first round of the NCAA tournament PERIOD

In the event that Monroe decides to return the Hoyas would have multiple options at every spot on the floor PERIOD Starting point guard Chris Wright could be spelled by Starks or Vee Sanford while shooting guard Jason Clark can also play the one effectively PERIOD Versatility in the backcourt would allow Thompson to use different combinations at the guard positions PERIOD

Austin Freeman would start again at the third guardsmall forward spot and behind him would be Hollis Thompson who showed significant growth from start to finish this season and Bowen PERIOD At power forward the Hoyas would return Julian Vaughn and Jerrelle Benimon in addition to newcomers Lubick and Abraham and Monroe and Henry Sims would be the men in the middle PERIOD

Assuming Monroe will be back in a Georgetown uniform next season is premature and might be wishful thinking but the Hoyas received another upgrade with the addition of Abraham to an already deep recruiting class PERIOD Especially in the rough and tough Big East able bodies are always a good thing to have PERIOD
