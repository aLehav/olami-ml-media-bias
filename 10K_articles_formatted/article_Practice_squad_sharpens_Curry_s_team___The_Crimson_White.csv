7944,2021-03-13,"when coach Kristy Curry arrived at Alabama she knew changes had to be made for the program to be successful PERIOD One critical change she made was the creation of an allmale practice squad PERIOD

They are kind of like the teams big brothers Curry said PERIOD They can make you more competitive and they can make you more physical PERIOD They just give us a completely different look with their quickness and athleticism. the  members of the squad attend practices that fit around their schedules PERIOD Conflicts happen but the womens basketball team usually works with seven guys in a given practice PERIOD

The squad grew when the program sent out feelers to those who played intramural basketball the previous year PERIOD Guys signed up looking to help the womens team and take advantage of the opportunity to play competitive basketball consistently PERIOD

It gives our team more of an opportunity to focus on preparation of who we need to be Curry said PERIOD Those guys are a blessing PERIOD As our program has evolved with our current players it has been amazing to see our practice squad improve and how many guys want to be a part of it. members of the squad are not just there to practice with the team PERIOD They have also managed to build friendships with many of the players PERIOD Practicing with Alabama every day can get competitive but it also forces them to learn about the players they are helping PERIOD Junior member Joe Nissen has used the squad as more than just a way to play basketball PERIOD

I think we have managed to get to know many of the players Nissen said PERIOD Being around them so much has allowed for us to get to know them as people off the court. while on the court the team is trying to get more physical and have a game attitude PERIOD The squad has to will the team to get more and more competitive each day PERIOD Sophomore Meoshonti Knight says the practice players help her get that competitive fire PERIOD

We form relationships with the practice players Knight said PERIOD It kind of gets personal out there sometimes PERIOD They really make us compete PERIOD It is real fun to play against them every day. this week the practice squad has helped the team prepare for its upcoming road trip to Arkansas on Thursday PERIOD Alabama has yet to win a road game this year so preparation is key PERIOD

We got scouting reports of Arkansas and have to play as one of the opponents players Nissen said PERIOD We watch film and have to learn the opponents plays every practice. the team has not only used them as a preparation tool but also to have friends playing a similar sport to connect with PERIOD The team is dedicated to improving while the squad commits time to volunteer for them PERIOD",Practice squad sharpens Curry's team â€“ The Crimson White,University of Alabama
