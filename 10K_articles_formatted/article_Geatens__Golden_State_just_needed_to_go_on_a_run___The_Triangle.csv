9458,1970-01-01,"going into game five of the Western Conference Finals series with the Oklahoma City Thunder many fans thought things looked bleak for the Golden State Warriors  and how could you blame them

Golden State a frontrunner throughout the entirety of the regular National Basketball Association season had simply fallen behind PERIOD OKC led the series  and was coming off of back to back wins plus in game five they had the home court advantage PERIOD In fact OKCs backtoback wins marked the first two backtoback losses that Golden State had all season long PERIOD

The fate of a team that had won  regular season games was suddenly shaky but then Golden State pulled out game five  and that was when I knew the series would be over PERIOD Not with the anticipated OKC upset but with a comeback series for the Warriors PERIOD Its all because basketball is a game thats about momentum PERIOD

A wise coach once told me that basketball is a game of runs  in games tournaments and series PERIOD Teams go on runs PERIOD Individuals go on runs PERIOD Those runs are key to the success of any sports team or program PERIOD

The thing about runs is that eventually they end and the opponent gets a chance to go on a run too its just the nature of the game PERIOD

During the initial part of the Western Conference Finals it was blatantly obvious that the Thunder were on a run PERIOD As stated earlier they dealt the Warriors two losses back to back something that hadnt been done this season PERIOD Their defense jammed up unanimous league MVP Stephen Curry PERIOD Curry who averages . points per game was held to just  in game four PERIOD If OKC couldve kept up their run for one more contest obviously theyd be headed to the NBA finals PERIOD

The Thunder made a strong run but it just ended PERIOD

And then all of a sudden the momentum was back in favor of the Warriors PERIOD

I had this debate with a few people PERIOD They thought Sure Golden State could pull out a game six but grab game seven for the come behind win Unlikely. more than possible in my opinion PERIOD They had the run and while its hard to beat a team in three consecutive games Curry was back on his run too PERIOD Not only was the Golden State team hitting their niche Curry hit his groove again grabbing  points each in games five and six and  in game seven PERIOD

It was only so long before hed go on a run again PERIOD",Geatens: Golden State just needed to go on a run - The Triangle,Drexel University
