Kasey Donnelly as Audrey and Nick Whittaker as Seymour PERIOD

The leaves are turning bright colors a chill is in the air and creepy decorations of ghosts and goblins are showing up on many neighborhood lawns PERIOD To help get us into the Halloween spirit Eastern Michigan University Theatre will produce Little Shop of Horrors opening Thursday PERIOD

In addition to being one of offBroadways longest running musicals Horrorshas become something of a cult classic thanks to a  movie adaptation PERIOD

I dont know anyone who doesnt like this show said Phil Simmons who directs and choreographs the EMU production alongside musical director R PERIOD Mackenzie Lewis PERIOD

With book and lyrics by Howard Ashman and music by Alan Menken Little Shop of Horrorsis the story of Seymour a meek shop clerk who dreams of love fortune and fame PERIOD He has a secret crush on his coworker Audrey who also has dreams of getting away and finding love PERIOD

The musical comedy turns dark when Seymour finds and raises a strange plant which he names Audrey II PERIOD The plant it turns out has a thirst for human blood and manipulates Seymour Audrey and others around it in order to be fed PERIOD

Simmons directed and choreographed the show with musical direction from Lewis six years ago at Ann Arbors Performance Network Theatre and they were excited to team up to put on the current production PERIOD

I remembered the numbers I wanted to do differentlythat I wanted to do a better job with Simmons said PERIOD It was like getting a second chance. one of the key elements of the show and one that makes it more difficult to do is the fact that four puppets play four stages of the role of Audrey II PERIOD It provided a unique challenge for Simmons and the rest of the production team PERIOD

Its a different way to have to think about informing the audience said Simmons PERIOD In a way we have to think of them as additional actors. a puppet expert Seth Shaffer trained the actors who use and interact with the puppets and the shows movement specialist Jennifer Graham helped to refine and hone the movement of the four different puppets said Simmons PERIOD

No doubt the puppetry is a major reason to go see the show but more of the shows best qualities speak for themselves PERIOD

This show has some of my favorite music in all of the musical theatre canonSomewhere Thats Green is one of my favorite tunes ever said Simmons PERIOD
