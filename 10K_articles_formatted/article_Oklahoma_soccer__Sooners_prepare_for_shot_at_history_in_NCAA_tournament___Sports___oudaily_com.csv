Senior midfielder Shiloh Price takes on two Oklahoma State defenders PERIOD University of Oklahoma Womens Soccer take on Oklahoma State University in the Bedlam game winning  on Aug PERIOD  PERIOD

The Sooners have a chance to make history when they play in the NCAA Womens Soccer tournament this Friday in Norman PERIOD

With a recordtying  wins this season the Sooners will have the opportunity to compete in the NCAA tournament for only the fourth time in program history PERIOD Oklahoma found out its destiny Monday afternoon and will now prepare to face a solid SMU team on Friday PERIOD

With a win on Friday the Sooners would be the first team in program history to have  wins in a season and the first to win a game in the tournament PERIOD

The Sooners are an experienced squad that features eight seniors all with tournament appearances PERIOD Seniors like Shiloh Price were excited about the selection but she and her teammates know this was to be expected PERIOD

My initial reaction was excitement but I was prepared for it Price said PERIOD Weve been preparing this whole season and everything that weve done to this point PERIOD We kind of knew we wanted to be playing in November PERIOD I think it was our expectation. in his fifth year as head coach Matt Potter believes his team has been working towards this goal for not just the course of this season but over multiple years PERIOD

Its not just the  or  weeks of a season that go into preparing and thats what you celebrate when your name is called Potter said PERIOD Its the fact of a years work or multiple even years work in our case because weve been trying build to that point of consistently being a postseason team. oklahoma will have a tough challenge in the first round facing the American Athletic Conference runnerup SMU PERIOD The Mustangs have outscored their opponents by a combined score of  and have an impressive record of  PERIOD The Sooners will have to play their best soccer of the year if they want to advance to the second round PERIOD

The Sooners may have a secret weapon heading into the tournament with senior transfer Liz Keester who actually made a Final Four appearance in  with Texas AM PERIOD Keester leads the Sooners in scoring with nine goals including five gamewinners PERIOD She and some of the other seniors have talked to the younger players about what to expect and how to prepare PERIOD

As a senior class I think weve all shared advice about the NCAAs Keester said PERIOD Its a different game every time you step out there PERIOD I think we have all just been trying to share our advice and just really get the point that its a different game it doesnt matter whos out there PERIOD You have to win or youre done. oklahomas last tournament appearance was just two years ago when they fell to Arkansas  in the first round PERIOD In all three of Oklahomas previous appearances in the tournament they have fallen short PERIOD This years team realizes that with a win on Friday they will make program history PERIOD

We are trying to grow and make history for this program every day PERIOD It would just be another steppingstone going in the right direction and it would say a lot about the work weve done since last November when we werent selected senior Shiloh Price said PERIOD

A win could be a turning point for not only the program but also the coaching staff PERIOD

Since Potter has arrived at Oklahoma he has turned the program around with three tenplus win seasons and now two NCAA tournament appearances PERIOD For Potter a victory is something this program has been striving for over his five years as head coach PERIOD

Its another benchmark that the program lives into the traditions and expectations of the department and the university Potter said PERIOD Its obviously something we strive for and if we can live into that on Friday night that would be great. the match against SMU is Friday night at John Crain Field at  p.m PERIOD The game will also be broadcasted on FCSC or Fox Sports Go PERIOD
