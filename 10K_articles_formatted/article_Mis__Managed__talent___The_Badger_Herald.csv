An unlikely couple Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler steer Anger Management into the crossgenerational crossgenre waters of awkwardness previously chartered by Eminem and Elton John in their infamous Grammy duet PERIOD Both actors put forth fine efforts in this entirely performancedriven film but save for a few memorable scenes the oil and vinegar simply dont mix PERIOD

Dave Buznik Sandler Billy Madison is a communitycollege graduate in an Ivy League world PERIOD He is a hard worker and loyal boyfriend but only emerges from his shell of intimidation when alone with his girlfriend Linda Marisa Tomei My Cousin Vinny PERIOD

An utterly absurd yet perversely amusing course of events lead Buznik to wreak havoc aboard an airplane and assault a blind man PERIOD Rather than send Dave to prison a judge deceased Lynne Thigpen Shaft sentences him to intense roundtheclock anger management with the noted and controversial therapist Buddy Rydell Nicholson As Good As It Gets a punishment arguably worse than jail PERIOD

What follows is not so much a movie as a sketch comedy determined to milk the SandlerNicholson pairing for as many onejoke scenes of outrage as possible PERIOD Whether it is their sharing of an undersized bed or their tagteam assault on a monk their activities do little to actually advance any semblance of a plot other than reiterating the painful juxtaposition of the patients sanity to the therapists obvious insanity PERIOD

The jokes however are often uproarious PERIOD From a Seinfeldesque commentary on airplane etiquette in a time of heightened caution and patriotism to an unforgettable moment involving Gershwin music and the Queensboro Bridge the laughs are plentiful PERIOD

Be warned though that such humor frequently comes at an offensive price PERIOD The movie takes cheap shots at combat veterans the physically handicapped the mentally handicapped overweight pets and Buddha himself just to list a few PERIOD

The film also comes up well short of reality PERIOD The movie demands a twist ending and gets one but it is full of holes and omitted explanations PERIOD Additionally a lifelong New Yorker kindly reminded this critic that cars dont travel on Manhattans bridges at Daytona speeds during rush hour PERIOD Anger Management however is oblivious to such elements of reality PERIOD But then again therapists dont normally share beds with their patients well at least not ethically PERIOD

The real heart of the movie though is the acting PERIOD Nicholson turns in such an excellent performance that it is painful to see it go to naught PERIOD The utter insanity that Nicholson portrays with his face alone is reminiscent of his brilliant turn in The Shining. and despite merely reprising his old tired onenote character Sandler should be commended for sharing the screen a new trick for the otherwise narcissistic actor PERIOD Tomei rounds out the lead cast with tremendous charisma and sex appeal that plays off of both male leads well PERIOD

If the trio of stars doesnt strike your fancy the cameos are plentiful PERIOD Before the credits role Woody Harrelson John Turturro Nancy Walls Luis Guzman Rudy Giuliani and Bobby Knight all steal screen time PERIOD

But perhaps the result of this oilandvinegar experiment is somewhat predictable PERIOD It was foolish to think that Elton John could raise the lyrics of Stan to the caliber of Your Song. it is equally foolish to suppose that Jack Nicholson could somehow turn The Wedding Singer into Chinatown. this article was published Apr   at  am and last
