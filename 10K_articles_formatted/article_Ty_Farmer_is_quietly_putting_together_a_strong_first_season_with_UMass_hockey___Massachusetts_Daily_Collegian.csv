Everyone who follows the Massachusetts hockey team or college hockey for that matter knows the name Cale Makar PERIOD The highest draft pick in school history is the undisputed star on the UMass blueline PERIOD Mario Ferraro isnt too far behind Makar in terms of name recognition or talent among Minutemen defensemen PERIOD Marc Del Gaizo has also quickly established himself as an offensivelyoriented rearguard in just his first season slotting in  points in  games PERIOD

Ty Farmer is next PERIOD

Rounding out the top four UMass   Hockey East Association defensemen Farmer hasnt jumped off the stat sheet and might not have quite the same reputation but his impact has been just as valuable PERIOD

I think he distributes the puckhim and Cale Makar are both pretty elite at outletting the puck distributing the puck coach Greg Carvel said PERIOD He sees the game extremely well and hes agile hes mobile. farmer is a prototypical puckmoving defenseman PERIOD His skills come to life in the transition game particularly when hes hitting forwards in the neutral zone with a hard first pass out of the zone PERIOD The cleanliness of that connection can be the difference between a scoring chance or a turnover and Farmer consistently hits his mark PERIOD

He can also defend admirably for a guy with his size   feet  inches  and the OFallon Missouri native feels his game in the Minutemens own zone has seen the most change PERIOD

I think Ive been making a lot smarter plays with the puck and I think my defensive game has improved a lot as well Farmer said PERIOD Boxing guys out being a smaller defenseman its not always easy especially in a league like this PERIOD I think my defensive game has moved up and I think my offensive ability is starting to show a little more. in UMass  overtime loss to Northeastern last Saturday Farmer assisted on John Leonards goal coming from a shot below the goal line PERIOD His skating ability allows him to take chances with rushes up the ice and gives him the freedom to make such plays like his helper on Leonards gametying goal PERIOD

I think hes been very consistent just from day one to now we get about the same thing out of him every night Carvel said PERIOD

Farmer holds a threegame point streak heading into UMass upcoming weekend series with Maine which sees the Black Bears   HEA in eighthplace in Hockey East PERIOD However that spot in the standings wont fool the Minutemen from thinking any less of the competition PERIOD

Its tough PERIOD Every team is good Farmer said PERIOD Every night you have to bring it and theres teams thatll sneak up on you that you dont expect especially where were ranked right now we have a target on our back PERIOD Everyone is coming bringing their best game. while Farmers talents might not be the flashiest they certainly will go a long way in aiding the Minutemen for the rest of the season in league play starting with Maine Friday night PERIOD
