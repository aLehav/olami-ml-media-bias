Redshirt junior guardforward Dominique Claytor takes the basketball down the court against Wichita State University on Saturday PERIOD

Despite tying their seasonhigh for threepointers with seven the East Carolina University   AAC womens basketball team fell just shy of winning their second consecutive game falling  to Wichita State University   AAC on Saturday afternoon PERIOD

ECU finished the game going 22of52 . from the floor 7of18 . from three and 4of10 . from the freethrow line PERIOD Wichita State on the other hand went 16of44 . from the field 4of16 . from beyond the arc and 21of30 . from the charity stripe and it was that advantage from the freethrow line that made the difference in the game PERIOD

Neither team could muster much offense in the first half as the score by halftime was tied at  PERIOD The Shockers were able to go 9of14 from the charity stripe in the second quarter to not allow ECU to pull away PERIOD

The second half was more hectic as the lead changed several times PERIOD There were significant momentum swings PERIOD Neither team could create any real separation in the third quarter PERIOD ECU shot the ball well shooting  from the floor PERIOD Wichita State couldnt make anything from the floor finishing the quarter only having made four field goals but went 6for9 from the freethrow line and managed to keep the game close going into the fourth PERIOD

Wichita State started the fourth with a  run giving the Shockers their largest lead of the game at  with just  remaining PERIOD The Pirates began to get back into the game after Monk made her first field goal of the game which was a threepointer that stopped an  run from the Shockers PERIOD In the next ECU possession Thompson hit a threepointer off an assist from Monk to cut the lead to just one point PERIOD

Wichita State pushed back making it a fourpoint game with just over a minute remaining but Monk hit her second threepointer of the game to get ECU back within one PERIOD The Pirates were able to get a stop and gave themselves a chance to take the lead with under a minute to go PERIOD After a timeout ECU ran Monk off a pair of screens and she found Claytor alone who made a layup giving ECU a  lead with just  seconds remaining PERIOD

However the Pirates couldnt get the stop they needed as Wichita State hit a threepointer to put the Shockers back in front PERIOD ECU had one final chance to tie the game but Monks jumper bounced off the rim and Wichita State walked away victorious PERIOD

Im really disappointed in our lack of executing the game plan against Wichita State today head coach Kim McNeill said PERIOD I thought after our win against Memphis we would come in with a different approach a different mentality PERIOD I thought we had learned how to win and how to hold onto leads PERIOD But well get back after it on Monday PERIOD We cant hold our heads. eCU takes to the court again on Feb PERIOD  to play the University of Houston   AAC in Minges Coliseum in Greenville North Carolina PERIOD
