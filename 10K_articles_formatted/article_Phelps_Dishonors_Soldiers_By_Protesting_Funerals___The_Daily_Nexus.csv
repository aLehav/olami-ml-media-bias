4110,2006-03-08,"william Shakespeare once said Even the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. as I glanced through the headlines of cnn.com I stumbled upon an article titled Dodge City Showdown at Funeral that illustrates this quote disgustingly well PERIOD

Now usually when I read articles containing the phrases Thank God for IEDs  which stands for improvised explosive devices  and Thank God for dead soldiers I would expect to read about Iraqi insurgents or Islamic terrorists celebrating a new record in U.S PERIOD military deaths complete with the obligatory image of torched American flags PERIOD However I never expected slogans so tasteless to come from citizens of my very own country PERIOD Not even the lunatic fringe of ultraleftists could be so opposed to the war in Iraq as to wish death upon our soldiers overseas PERIOD

Meet Fred Phelps pastor of Westboro Baptist Church who claims You cant preach the Bible without preaching the hatred of God. okay asshole PERIOD You certainly cant preach the Bible without preaching the love of Jesus either PERIOD Phelps and his congregation consisting mostly of his own family members have traveled to over  military funerals across the country to dishonor the deaths of fallen soldiers who they claim are fighting for a country that is being destroyed by homosexuality PERIOD

Where do I possibly begin

First I cannot find a link between the war in Iraq and blaming homosexuality for Americas problems PERIOD Last I heard the U.S PERIOD invaded Iraq to topple the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein not to liberate the gay and lesbian Iraqis from his oppression PERIOD Nor can I find a relationship between the military itself and homosexuality PERIOD Our military always draws criticism for its controversial Dont Ask Dont Tell policy towards homosexuals and just last month seven soldiers from the eighty-second Airborne division were in deep shit for posing on a gay porn website with a military theme PERIOD The U.S PERIOD Army sure as hell doesnt put up with it PERIOD

Next what would Jesus do Would Jesus picket military funerals and tell those families that their sons and daughters deserved to die because they fought on behalf of a country that doesnt treat homosexuals as secondclass citizens Now if I were Jesus as one of infinite power I would ask Father to destroy Mr PERIOD Phelps Sodom and Gomorrahstyle not the soldiers of the very country to which I belong PERIOD  However Im not Jesus and Jesus is one too calm and collected to sink to that level PERIOD Which reminds me Jesus said nothing condemning homosexuality no matter which version of the Bible you read PERIOD

Last if anyone hates America and its current stance on homosexuality and its soldiers leave PERIOD America doesnt want Phelps and his congregation and Im sure they can find likeminded individuals in a country like Iran or Libya willing to celebrate the deaths of American soldiers and roast marshmallows over a burning American flag so long as they are willing to call their god Allah in the meantime PERIOD

I urge Christian and Jewish leaders to condemn Fred Phelps and distance themselves from his narrowminded interpretation of the Bible PERIOD I urge reasonable politicians left or right to propose legislation that would restrict demonstrating outside military funerals PERIOD I urge all concerned students to call your local representatives and make yourself heard PERIOD

On a brighter note cheers to the Patriot Guard Riders who showed up  strong last weekend by motorcycle to support the family of Sgt PERIOD Jessie Davila in spite of the Westboro Baptist Churchs presence PERIOD

Fred Phelps if youre reading this you can kiss my ass PERIOD
