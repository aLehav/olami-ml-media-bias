There is a memorable scene in Disneys classic  film Mary Poppinswhen Mary Poppins and Bert jump into the world of sidewalk chalk PERIOD In this partially animated partially liveaction world they sing with farm animals hang out with penguins in tuxedos ride on the backs of turtles and dance with butterflies PERIOD To put it simply FOXs new animated and liveaction comedy Son of Zorn is everything and nothing like this PERIOD In Son of Zorn a bird is more likely to be violently beheaded than sung to a turtle would be stabbed in the back instead of ridden and kids are more likely to end up cut in half than cheerfully enjoying ice cream or flying a kite PERIOD

Jason Sudeikis voices a cartoon barbarian named Zorn who must leave his job of brutally and gorily defending his home village of Zephyriato to enter the real world and attempt to reconnect with his nowteenage son PERIOD After Zorn takes a flight from Zephyriato to Orange County he tries to greet his son Alan Johnny Pemberton as he is getting off the bus PERIOD Alan however quickly becomes embarrassed by his dads loincloth shouting and swinging a sword and never gets off the bus PERIOD That night Zorns exwife Edie Cheryl Hines convinces him that if he wants any chance at a meaningful relationship with his son he cant just stop by for a weekend every few yearshe has to move back for good PERIOD Zorn decides to give it a shot and commits to his new endeavor by getting an apartment and a job PERIOD

Once you look past the visual absurdity of the 80s cartoon character juxtaposed onto the modern world the show actually becomes surprisingly conventional PERIOD The plot boils down to a dad who missed his son growing up and is now trying his best to reconnect in a world in which he could not be more out of place PERIOD The most successful jokes are not the violent cartoon deaths but rather Zorn struggling to fit in in aplace he neither belongs nor understands PERIOD The laughs come at seeing him stuck in the middle seat of an airplane where his fellow passengers are largely indifferent to his status as a legendary warrior or having him crammed in a cubicle reduced to selling industrial soap dispensers PERIOD The premiere episode ends on its best bit when Zorn learns the idea of being considerate and gets his son his own a ride to schoolits not a new car but a giant cartoon hawk PERIOD When Edie puts her foot down on the idea Zorn casually starts slashing the hawk to death PERIOD

One easily apparent flaw in the show is the difficulty of acting with a cartoon character that is going to be added in postproduction PERIOD This skilled cast at times is reduced to awkward blandness without having a live body to work across from PERIOD You can almost feel the empty space between Zorn and the other characters PERIOD Despite this issue however the cast is able to achieve a lot PERIOD Two minor characters Zorns boss Linda and Edies new fianc Craig Tim Meadows are both able to create comedic moments by acting small and allowing the literally largerthanlife Zorn to have the punchlines PERIOD

A major theme of the show revolves around what it means to be a man in todays society PERIOD We meet three different male characters each with a different definition of what being a man means PERIOD Zorn is the classic alpha malea meatheaded swordwielding tablebreaking misogynistic generallyoutofplaceinmodernsociety man PERIOD On the opposite side of the spectrum we have Craig a Crocwearing online psychology teacher who is prone to referring to himself as emasculated PERIOD Somewhere in between the two we have Alan who is still trying to figure out where he fits on the spectrum PERIOD He is a modern teenager a vegetarian who cares about the environment and is appalled at his dads blatant sexism PERIOD It will be intriguing to see how Alan develops with these two drastically different role models PERIOD

Despite the use of conventional tropes Son of Zorn is still a bizarre show especially for a major network like FOX PERIOD FOX has a history of greenlighting unique shows but it still needs to earn ratings to stay on air PERIOD The first episode was highly uneven but ended on a strong note that should have been intriguing enough to keep audiences tuned in next week PERIOD The true measure of this shows success will be if it is to keep a large enough audience to support a show on FOX PERIOD
