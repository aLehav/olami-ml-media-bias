Seniors Dani Eggleston and Luke Plummer started the indoor track and field season with marks that hit the provisional mark for the NCAA Nationals meet on March  PERIOD

That doesnt guarantee national competition PERIOD If they dont hit the automatic its up to the top  in the provisionals head coach Kevin Adkisson said PERIOD

Eggleston is competing in long distance events such as the 3k and 5k runs while Plummer is focusing on the triple jump PERIOD

Theyre both veteran AllAmericans so it isnt very unusual for them to hit provisionals so early PERIOD Once they hit it their goal is to get to nationals Adkisson said PERIOD Its about shooting for the next goal PERIOD For Dani and Luke it would be to shoot for the automatic entry. by setting provisional markings in the first meet of the season Eggleston and Plummer started on the list of national qualifiers PERIOD For most athletes it takes a while to get back into the best performancelevel coming into the season PERIOD

Its nice to hit provisionals but its nowhere near where Id like to be Plummer said PERIOD Id like to be at  meters by the end of the season I hit . last year so itd be manageable PERIOD Its a little more stressful coming back this year knowing that the potential is there and that I just need to reach that again. the pressure for an athlete to meet and surpass the scores they made the year before can be motivating but its up to the individual to set their personal goals and know their limitations PERIOD

I think automatic qualifying time is a bit unrealistic but I want to hit the top 20s to get to nationals Eggleston said PERIOD I just kind of go out there and run PERIOD I think people overthink it too much and I try not to let competition get me too anxious. at the University of Washington Invitational this past weekend Plummer managed to get close to his goal with a distance of . meters in triple jump and Eggleston claimed her third school record PERIOD

Her first two are in the  meter run and the  meter steeplechase but her latest achievement was running the  meter run in . beating the previous record by roughly six seconds previously held by Alicen Maier with a time of . pERIOD

Im looking to hit AllAmerican again Eggleston said PERIOD Its hard to get to that point and if I get eighth in nationals Id be happy but Id like to get higher. in addition to her performance in the  meter run Eggleston is looking forward to competitions in the  PERIOD

Theres not many 5ks for indoors so I have to wait for University of Washington invites and conferences Eggleston said PERIOD Ill be running the 3k and the mile while I wait since it helps with speed work PERIOD Id like to make it to nationals in the 5k and hopefully be able to earn AllAmerican again. by the students for the students of Central Washington University
