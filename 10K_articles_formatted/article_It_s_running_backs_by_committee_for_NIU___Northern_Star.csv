By  Frank GogolaAugust  

While thenredshirt junior quarterback Jordan Lynch shouldered the majority of the running load last season the NIU Huskies will go with a runningbackbycommittee system this season that could wreak havoc PERIOD

The running back committee will feature redshirt junior Cameron Stingily sophomore Keith Harris Jr. redshirt junior Giorgio Bowers and redshirt junior James Spencer PERIOD

The other major component of the committee is senior Akeem Daniels who rushed for  yards and nine touchdowns and recorded  receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns last season but is still dealing with an injury PERIOD

Hes Akeem Daniels not healthy said head coach Rod Carey in a news conference PERIOD Hes got a little toe thing thats keeping him from going yet PERIOD Hes going to be back with us its just a matter of when. with the 5foot7 184pound Daniels still sidelined with an injury Stingily and Harris are listed as the No PERIOD  and No PERIOD  running backs respectively on the twodeep depth chart and will take on the majority of the carries against the Iowa Hawkeyes this weekend PERIOD Stingily had exactly one rush for five yards last season and Harris had  carries for  yards and four touchdowns PERIOD

Cam Stingily obviously is the bigger of the two guys said running backs coach Kelton Copeland PERIOD He brings something to the table that NIU hasnt had at running back for a while with his size and his power PERIOD Hes a weapon to be reckoned with for sure PERIOD

The secrets out on Keith Harris Jr. PERIOD He played last year and he actually scored in last years game against Iowa so everybody knows what kind of talent he had as a true freshman. stingily standing at 6foot1 weighing in at  pounds is out to prove that he can be an impact player on the Huskies offense this season after not playing much last season PERIOD Coupled with the 5foot8 181pound Harris the duo has the makings of a firstrate backfield PERIOD

Theyre a great combination with Cam Stingily being the bigger stronger back and then Keith Harris Jr. coming in and being more of a slashertype running back Copeland said PERIOD So with those two we feel like we have a serious onetwo punch in the backfield. rounding out the committee are Bowers and Spencer who will take on more reps with the team PERIOD At 5foot8  pounds Bowers carried the ball  times for  yards last season while Spencer at 5foot8  pounds took two handoffs for  total yards PERIOD

Were a very highoctane hightempo offense so were gonna use more than just Keith Harris Jr. and Cam Stingily Copeland said PERIOD Giorgio Bowers got experience last year and well look for him to contribute even more this year PERIOD Then theres a young man by the name James Spencer PERIOD Well look for him to contribute as well PERIOD So it will definitely be a running back by committee outlook. advertisement
