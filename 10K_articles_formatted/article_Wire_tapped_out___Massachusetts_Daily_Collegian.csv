Dear editor

Re A solid surveillance solution Dan Nicastro EdOp Mar PERIOD   PERIOD

Dan Nicastros column about wiretapping is so far from the mark of actual fact that its surprising his fear mongering doesnt raise the ire of his fellow students PERIOD But then thats what you get for reading press releases from the American Civil Liberties Union and citing them without you know doing due diligence to check them out PERIOD

Nicastro would have the email that Achmed in Damascus sent to Abdul in Baghdad that  coincidentally  gets routed through Hoboken NJ have the same Fourth Amendment protections as American citizens PERIOD

In case Nicastro hasnt noticed theres a war on PERIOD Intelligence is a part of that war By his standards a listening station in Hawaii in WWII could not have listened to Japanese transmissions because the radio waves went over U.S PERIOD territory PERIOD

As to the telecoms The courts have consistently ruled that your phone records are not your property they are the companys PERIOD They arent listening to you and Aunt Matilda theyre looking for patterns PERIOD And the lack of immunity to their helping our government find and stop terrorist attacks is a great big wet kiss to the Trial Lawyers  the Democrats biggest contributors PERIOD

After  the left excoriated President Bush for not connecting the dots PERIOD Now the Left wants to keep anyone from even seeing them  until of course the next attack when the left will  like clockwork  ask how we didnt see it coming PERIOD
