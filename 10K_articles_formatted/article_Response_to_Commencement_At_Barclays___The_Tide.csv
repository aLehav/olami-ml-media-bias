Dear President Steinberg

In addition to my own personal vendetta I have been asked to represent the Social Work club and the Social Work Department to express our concerns and disappointment regarding this years commencement PERIOD As you said yourself in the memorandum sent out November  commencement is about linking each institution to its own roots and all to a tradition that dates back many centuries. in the case of Post we have our own roots and traditions which include a ceremony on our campus for the past  years PERIOD Last year was detrimental to students because of the name change but at least the class of  was able to hold onto C.W PERIOD Posts tradition graduating in the white tent on the Great Lawn with their entire graduating class PERIOD As an orientation leader I was able to witness the community that had formed and seeing the entire class together as one really gave me something to look forward to for my own graduation PERIOD I am now saddened to find this tradition and unity of C.W PERIOD Post has been broken PERIOD

This ceremony at the Barclays Center is not an adequate form to celebrate our academic achievements PERIOD The maximum of two guests is a perceived potential problem as many students have expressed already PERIOD
To have guests travel to Brooklyn to a large venue and then exclude family members from entering is unsuitable PERIOD Not to mention the discrepancies between academic calendars forcing Post to wait for Brooklyn tograduate PERIOD However what is most infuriating for Post students is the new three ticket limit for the ceremonies on our own campus PERIOD

Due to the amount of money this school has spent on a frivolous name change the wonderful tent we look forward to seeing every year will be absent PERIOD With the tent on the Great Lawn guests were unlimited and everyone could witness the students graduate PERIOD Now with the two separate days for recognitions and awards at Post tickets are limited to three per student where in years past this was not the case PERIOD Families are going to be distraught and a time of happiness will be turned into pressured decision making for the students on who can watch them graduate and who is not worthy enough to earn the golden ticket PERIOD In addition the separate days will destroy this campuss unity PERIOD Not everyone will be seen in their cap and gown on the same day PERIOD Families and friends will not be together for this special event we have all looked forward to for the past four years PERIOD

I would also like to acknowledge your quotes in The Pioneer dated December  PERIOD Apparently our opinions about our own graduation is not important enough because if theres a deep sense of anger oh well PERIOD You are passing this problem onto your successor which I find to be widely inappropriate and unprofessional PERIOD For you to end your career at this school in this manner only shows your eagerness to leave and an absent compassion towards this school and the students PERIOD We may be one university under our new logo but this is one campus with one student body who hold one opinion on our one and only college
graduation PERIOD I sincerely hope you consider my opinion and the opinions of others I am representing as well PERIOD I look forward to your response and I hope we can come to terms where your wishes as well as the students wishes are met PERIOD

Sincerely

Audrey Thompson
