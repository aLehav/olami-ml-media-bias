2414,2023-10-26,"officially established in June  Global Campus was aimed at expanding the Universitys accessibility to nontraditional students by providing online distance learning classes PERIOD But slow curriculum development unsatisfactory enrollment numbers questions about the programs educational quality and a multimillion dollar budget deficit have caused administrators teachers and trustees to consider if the venture is still worth pursuing PERIOD

The faculty seems to be unhappy said University Trustee Niranjan Shah PERIOD We dont know right now if this is a good use of the Universitys money. the administration has spent more than  million on Global Campus and University officials expect that number to rise to  million by the end of June PERIOD Global Campus CEO Chester Gardner projects the program to break even financially in May  when enrollment is predicted to reach about  students PERIOD

For its current March through April term Global Campus has  students enrolled in two bachelors degree programs and three masters degree programs PERIOD These numbers indicate a progression far slower than Gardners  estimates in which he predicted Global Campus to have enrolled  students by  PERIOD

University President B PERIOD Joseph White  an ardent and continuing supporter of Global Campus  acknowledged that the program has not performed up to standards PERIOD



In order to achieve its financial and educational goals Global Campus requested  and the Board of Trustees granted  the right to seek accreditation separate from the Universitys existing campuses in November  PERIOD

Currently Global Campus operates under a partnership with the University of Illinois campuses in Chicago Springfield and UrbanaChampaign PERIOD While partnership specifics vary between the three campuses the common agreement is that each campuss administration will oversee Global Campus classes and degree programs in exchange for granting diplomas via the online program PERIOD

Because the campus unit controls the degree they control the program they control the content they control who is hired to teach in the program said Nicholas Burbules chairman of the Senate Faculty Committee and professor of educational policy studies PERIOD

In addressing Global Campus shortcomings White appointed Burbules to head a faculty panel that will present the president and Board of Trustees with a proposal to remedy the programs problems on May  PERIOD

I think a lot of people are looking for a third way neither keeping Global Campus as it is nor shutting it down Burbules said PERIOD

Burbules believes that the program can maintain its partnership with the university and achieve its goal of becoming a more effective costefficient system PERIOD

In addition to administrative concerns about the programs financial viability campus students have expressed displeasure over Global Campus students receiving University of Illinois diplomas for online coursework PERIOD Members of the university student senate have stated that students fear that Global Campus degrees are easier to obtain and therefore lessen the universitys prestige Burbules said PERIOD

University officials however reject the idea that online classes are less valuable than those taught facetoface and agree that Global Campus and online learning in general affords students a learning experience that is in many ways superior to a traditional classroom setting PERIOD","Global Campus' future uncertain due to high costs, debated quality - The Daily Illini",University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
