Easterns ROTC at the Ranger Challenge PERIOD

By Brandon Cline Contributing WriterNovember  

The EWU Reserve Officers Training Corps ROTC traveled to Boise Idaho over the weekend to participate in the annual Ranger Challenge against other schools located in the Pacific Northwest PERIOD

The EWU ROTC team finished fourth amongst ten teams with Boise State University winning the competition PERIOD Gonzaga University finished second and the University of Nevada Reno finished third just one point ahead of EWU PERIOD

Cadet and junior Brian Trabun who is the captain of the ROTCs Ranger Challenge team said he felt pretty good about the teams performance this year PERIOD Overall this is the best weve done at least in my time at Eastern PERIOD We took fourth overall and lost out on third place by one point out of ten teams PERIOD We worked together well as a team. we set Tuesdays  Thursdays aside for extra PT and then often train for the event on Saturdays as a team said Trabun PERIOD He also added that the conditions in Boise over the weekend were pretty brutal as temperatures hovered in the teens along with seven inches of snow PERIOD

Programs from all over the country compete regionally in the Ranger Challenge PERIOD The ultimate goal is a trip to West Point to participate in the Sandhurst Military Skills Competition against service academy teams from throughout the United States and across the world including Canada the United Kingdom and Australia PERIOD

Lt PERIOD Col PERIOD Jason Pape department chair of EWUs Military Science program says the Ranger Challenge is the Army ROTCs varsity sport PERIOD Just like normal intercollegiate sports Army ROTC programs are broken down by geography and traditionally compete against the same schools said Pape PERIOD Just like the Big Sky conference we have our brigade with over  schools and the brigade breaks down into smaller conferences with about  or  schools in each group. eastern is part of the eighth Brigade comprised of schools located along the West Coast according to the Joint Base LewisMcChord website the brigades tenant PERIOD

Each ROTC program is part of a brigade and multiple conferences make up each brigade which are determined geographically said Pape PERIOD According to the Joint Base LewisMcChord website EWU is part of the eighth Brigade which is comprised of over  schools along the West Coast PERIOD Schools such as Central Washington University the University of Washington Gonzaga University and Washington State University compete in the same conference as EWU PERIOD

Each school sends nine cadets to participate in the Ranger Challenge along with one alternate in case of an injury PERIOD During the twoday event cadets participate in both mental and physical challenges including physical fitness tests an obstacle course land navigation courses in woods both during the day and at night evaluating a casualty and a  kilometer road march with  pound rucksacks according to the EWU ROTC website PERIOD

Even though there are many individual events the Ranger Challenge puts a large emphasis on teamwork PERIOD The scores on individual events are averaged out amongst the team to give a cumulative score so one cadet wont be able to carry a team by him or herself PERIOD

On the physical fitness test this year they all run it together and everybody has to keep their hands on a piece of rope PERIOD They basically have to stay together and one weak link could hold the entire team back said Pape who competed in three Ranger Challenges when he was in ROTC PERIOD

Starting this year the Ranger Challenge requires each program to have at least one cadet from each class standing which provides a challenge for the incoming freshman team member said Pape PERIOD

Usually when somebody comes into ROTC their first year theyre just trying to figure things out and its a very steep learning curve said Pape PERIOD In their sophomore year they feel like theyre ready to compete so the hard part is finding one brand new student who just showed up this fall thats ready to go out there and be a part of this team. the regional location where the Ranger Challenge is held rotates every year in the Pacific Northwest PERIOD Last year it was held at the Joint Base LewisMcChord near Tacoma Washington and three years ago it was held at Camp Seven Mile in Spokane PERIOD
