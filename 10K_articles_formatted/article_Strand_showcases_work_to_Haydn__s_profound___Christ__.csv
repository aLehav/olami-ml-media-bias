The Seven Last Words of Christ is often considered to be Haydns darkest and most profound work PERIOD Any ensemble that tackles the piece has their work cut out for it  consisting of long solemn movements it requires a great deal of patience on the part of the musician and the audience PERIOD But with the Brentano String Quartet and Pulitzer Prizewinning poet laureate Mark Strand at the helm the Seven Last Words of Christ has the potential to be one of the most uplifting concerts of the year PERIOD This Sunday the audience will be treated to an ambitious fusion of music and poetry PERIOD

Challenging our views of Christ and his last hours on the cross Strand adopted the Gospel of Thomas as a basis for his poems PERIOD This original poetry read between the movements of Haydns piece has been a twoyear laborintensive project for Strand PERIOD Differing from the Canonical versions of Christs last words that appear in the New Testament the Gospel of Thomas focuses on Christ as a wise man rather than a divinity PERIOD They are very poetic they have subjectivity said Strand PERIOD You get a sense of Jesus as a poet or a gifted preacher. for Strand composing poems to the Seven Last Words of Christ was both a new and rewarding experience PERIOD Though his works have often been set to music this was his first commission in which he interpreted a previously written orchestral piece PERIOD In doing research with the Gospels and other early Christian texts Strand worked hard to avoid clichs in his poetry PERIOD You cant tell the story againyou have to do something else otherwise you may as well stick with the original he said PERIOD The piece has a biblical air about it but at the same time its a contemporary poem. undertaking such a project was also challenging to the Brentano String Quartet who in a relatively short time has risen to the pinnacle of success PERIOD Currently the QuartetinResidence at Princeton and NYU the members of Brentano pride themselves on their interest in contemporary music PERIOD Always seeking to adopt new musical ideas Brentano commissioned Strand to write poetry to Haydns piece PERIOD With seven slow movements its difficult to concentrate and listen to without some intervening speaking said Brentano violinist Mark Steinberg PERIOD We wanted something that would be interesting and not completely religious. haydns Seven Last Words actually originated as an orchestral work and has taken several forms Whether performed by solo piano chorus or string quartet the piece represented a significant departure for the composer PERIOD The backandforth musical conversations characteristic of Haydns other string quartets are noticeably absent from Seven Last Words. the texture is really very simple  mostly melody and accompaniment said Steinberg PERIOD The surface of the music is not at all complicated but the expression of the music is very profound and deep. after many months of preparation Brentano and Strand are eager to introduce this original show to Ann Arbor PERIOD Both are confident in the ability of the music and poetry to play off each other  and they should be PERIOD With these artists as Haydns interpreters the audience can definitely look forward to an otherworldly performance PERIOD I think its going to shed a new light on the piece said Steinberg PERIOD Its going to give people a wonderful twoart experience. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
