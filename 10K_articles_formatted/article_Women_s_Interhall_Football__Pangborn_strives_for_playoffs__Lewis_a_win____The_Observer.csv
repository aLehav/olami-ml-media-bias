Griffin Dassatti Andy Renner and Kevin Henry  Friday October  

Riding a fourgame unbeaten streak and looking for continued outstanding performance from underclassmen Pangborn hopes to clinch a playoff spot as it takes on Lewis Sunday at  p.m PERIOD on Riehle Field PERIOD

After an openinggame loss to Welsh Family the Phoxes have bounced back tying Badin and then beating Lyons and Pasquerilla West in consecutive games PERIOD The team added to its unbeaten streak Thursday by tying BreenPhillips  PERIOD

Though they expressed some disappointment after giving up an 18point lead late in the game the Phoxes are all but guaranteed a playoff spot now PERIOD

Lewis comes into the game at  its first win coming in last weekends  victory over BreenPhillips PERIOD However the Chicks game against Badin was postponed earlier in the season so if they can get a win Sunday the playoffs may be a possibility PERIOD

This year Lewis has been led by sophomore quarterback Catherine Guarnieri who threw a gamewinning touchdown against the Babes PERIOD

Pangborns stellar group of underclassmen led by sophomore receiver and captain Meghan Bescher will also carry the brunt of the load PERIOD

Pasquerilla West vs PERIOD Lyons

Sundays matchup between Lyons and Pasquerilla West features two teams fighting for their lives PERIOD Both are on the cusp of the playoffs and a loss could mean somebody is going home PERIOD

Pasquerilla West continued its momentum from last season and defeated BreenPhillips and Lewis in its first two games PERIOD However it has since been slowed by backtoback losses to Welsh Family and Pangborn PERIOD

The defending champions are led on offense by freshman quarterback Grace Orians who has has accounted for all of the Weasels touchdowns this year both through the air and on the ground PERIOD

Pasquerilla Wests superb defense has also created offense recording numerous interceptions as well as a safety PERIOD

Lyons is in a similar situation as the Weasels after also losing to Welsh Family and Pangborn PERIOD Sophomore quarterback Claire Connell and freshman receiver Neva Lundy lead the Lions on offense PERIOD

That offense is complemented by staunch defense PERIOD Senior captain Judith Kaczmarek and senior safety Joanna Collins will look to force turnovers out of the Weasels and hopefully convert interceptions into touchdowns PERIOD

Lyons senior captain Katie Mackin could not be reached for comment Thursday PERIOD

This contest is crucial for both teams playoff aspirations and should be well fought PERIOD Pasquerilla West and Lyons face off Sunday at  p.m PERIOD on Riehle Field PERIOD

Welsh Family vs PERIOD Badin

Welsh Family will go up against Badin this Sunday at  p.m PERIOD at Riehle Field in a contest with playoffseeding implications on the line for one team and a possible playoff berth for another PERIOD

Undefeated Welsh Family could be playing for the No PERIOD  seed in the Gold League playoffs  which it currently has  while Badin could be playing for its playoff life PERIOD

Welsh Family senior captain Kelly Bushelle feels very confident about Sundays game and the playoffs PERIOD

Weve been doing the same things in practice that we have done all year and are well prepared to play Bushelle said PERIOD Weve worked on all aspects of the team not anything in particular. bushelle also mentioned her junior quarterback Jenni Gargula who has led the offense and the team to five wins this year PERIOD

Badins junior captain Katie Rose Hackney said there is still hope for her team to make the playoffs PERIOD

We know that everything has to go our way the next two games but we are going to play hard anyway and go out with confidence Hackney said PERIOD Thats all we can do. hackney said the Bullfrogs hope to be the first to take down almighty Welsh Family PERIOD To do that they knew they had to work hard in practice this week to finish plays in the end zone and capitalize on chances to score PERIOD

A Badin victory Sunday over undefeated Welsh Family would be quite the upset PERIOD
