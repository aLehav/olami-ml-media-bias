Possible Delta8 overdose at Lightsey Bridge

Its midFebruary PERIOD The bright fast food signs the inviting hum of the vending machine and the delectably greasy aroma emanating from the Canteen are giving you second thoughts about your New Years resolution to eat healthier PERIOD Or maybe youve already thrown in the towel this year PERIOD

Why is avoiding junk food so difficult

It might be larger than an issue of willpower neuroscientists at Aalto University in Finland believe you can actually be addicted to junk food PERIOD

A recent study showed that the brains of obese people had far fewer opioid receptors than did the brains of normalweight people PERIOD opioid receptors are on neurons brain cells and are responsible for that intense rush of pleasure you feel when you have sex shoot up heroin or bite into a hamburger PERIOD All of these gratifications activate the same neurophysiological circuits PERIOD

The study published in the Journal of Neuroscience concluded that in terms of addiction junk food can be just as dangerous as hard drugs PERIOD

Unfortunately the human brain is wired to register a high level of reward when we ingest food with high fat or sugar content because of those elements extreme scarcity in the natural world PERIOD Junk food is particularly treacherous because the caloriedense ingredients our palates crave are now available in limitless quantities  from the vending machine in your apartment building to the drivethrus on every corner PERIOD

We overdose on burgers ice cream and Coke because we havent yet adapted to the fast food industrys scientific quest to make us eat more of their products PERIOD

Modern food technology and the ubiquity of addictive foods have essentially hijacked our pleasure circuits PERIOD Fast food and soda corporations employ scientists to manipulate ingredients into unnaturally tasty colorful longlasting products PERIOD In this way this  billionperyear industry exploits our evolutionary hardwiring for a staggering profit PERIOD But at what cost

In a pattern consistent with the scientific literature on substance addiction the threshold of gustatory pleasure depends on the persons exposure to addictive foods PERIOD

Just like drugs and alcohol junk food can wear out the pleasure circuitry in the brain requiring more and more to reach the same level of reward PERIOD This vicious cycle is responsible for junk food addiction and its ugly consequences the epidemic proportions obesity heart disease and Type  diabetes have reached in the United States and other Westernized countries PERIOD

But you have the power to change your eating habits PERIOD

They are just that  habits PERIOD Habits can be broken if you place your longterm health above the ferocity with which you want to inhale that pile of cheese fries or Doritos or whatever your vice is PERIOD Once you understand the biology behind your cravings its easier to hold yourself accountable for what you put in your mouth PERIOD In fact the Eat Well With Clemson Home campaign is giving  free Paw Points to students for participating in a few Eat Well events at the dining halls PERIOD For more information visit any Clemson dining location for a flyer PERIOD
