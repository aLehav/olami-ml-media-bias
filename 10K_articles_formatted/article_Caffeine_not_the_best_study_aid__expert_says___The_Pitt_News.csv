Though it might be convenient to buy a large coffee or an energy drink to perk up experts say Though it might be convenient to buy a large coffee or an energy drink to perk up experts say caffeine might not be the best way to stay going during this hectic finalsfilled time of year PERIOD

According to one dietitian Nadiya Timperman the most effective way to stay alert for the day is to adopt a surprisingly simple concept just eat an apple PERIOD She was quick to add that its not so much the apple thats magical but more the simple act of eating breakfast that can help students push though the endofsemester rush PERIOD

Timperman is a registered dietitian and nutrition educator in Ohio PERIOD She related eating breakfast to starting a fire PERIOD

Timperman said eating healthy foods like an apple or other fruits or vegetables is like building a fire with good firewood The fire will burn strongly and give off light and heat  in other words energy PERIOD

Eating a healthy breakfast will make the fire burn steadily for a long time she said whereas drinking coffee or eating a donut or a muffin for breakfast is like building a fire with newspaper PERIOD It will burn bright and fast giving your body a burst of energy that doesnt last PERIOD

Members of Pitts student body reported a wide variety of practices to stay awake and alert while studying but few reported relying on fruit for these purposes PERIOD

Pitt junior Gabriel Cutler admitted to skipping breakfast and opting for a cup of coffee daily and although he does make a point of eating a good amount of fruit he does not do so to keep alert PERIOD

Senior Matt Timko said that he steers clear of coffee but relies on energy drinks like Red Bull and 5Hour Energy to stay awake when he needs to cram PERIOD Timko admitted that these drinks can be tough on the body even in moderation PERIOD

Freshman Amanda Amen takes a healthier approach to staying awake PERIOD Amen said that she refrains from drinking coffee and energy drinks both because she wants to avoid the crash that goes along with them and because she doesnt want to rely on a substance PERIOD Instead she eats a good amount of fruit and takes vitamins to help her stay awake during crunch time PERIOD

Speaking of tempting treats like donuts muffins and lattes Timperman said that she is baffled by people who rely on sweet foods to start their day PERIOD

What confuses Timperman is that these same people walk up to the counter and order a 20ounce mocha frappuccino with whipped cream and caramel and think that theyre making a smarter choice than just ordering the donut that they were drooling over. timperman said theres hardly any difference in calories between the donut we dont eat on principle and those specialty drinks we order every day. she continued asking why not just get the donut and be happy

Timperman did however stress the fact that she does not completely condemn coffee as the root of all evil PERIOD She admitted to needing her morning cup of coffee just like everybody else. she also took the time to explain how coffee can be both good and bad for the body PERIOD

Coffee is a diuretic meaning that it shuts off a hormone in your body  aptly named the antidiuretic hormone  which helps cells retain water PERIOD Drinking coffee causes the body to get rid of water which can lead to dehydration headaches and muscle pain PERIOD

Timperman said the entire process is actually very similar to drinking alcohol another popular diuretic which works biologically in the same way PERIOD

While caffeine is a drug it is a benign drug and people regard it as such Timperman said PERIOD Its the lesser of two evils. she added that studies have shown that low doses of caffeine daily can ultimately lower risks of diabetes kidney stones and even Alzheimers disease PERIOD
