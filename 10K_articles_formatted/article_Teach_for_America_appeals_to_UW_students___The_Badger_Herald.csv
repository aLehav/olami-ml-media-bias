Laura Nally Midwest recruitment director for Teach for America will be giving an informational meeting concerning the application process selection criteria and placement information for interested students Tuesday Nov PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD in the Multicultural Center PERIOD

At the meeting UW alumni of the program will also share their experiences teaching in urban areas PERIOD Students from all majors and all years are encouraged to come and get information about what the program has to offer PERIOD

This is one of the only opportunities to change lives right away and to inspire children to go to college PERIOD You can be a part of a larger movement without getting off track said David Washington campaign coordinator for Teach for America and a junior at UW PERIOD

Because members of the corps only are committed to two years of service the program gives graduates a unique opportunity to make a difference without sacrificing career opportunities or changing majors PERIOD

Im an engineer PERIOD I cant teach engineering to sixth graders but I can teach math or physics to high schoolers Washington said PERIOD

Zach Duffy an alumnus of UW with a creative writing degree was one of the  Madison applicants to be matriculated into the program last year PERIOD During his first month teaching in the South Side of Chicago hes had to deal with behavioral disturbances learning disabilities and  sixth graders half of whom are failing at least one subject PERIOD

The hardest part is that you cant see the difference youre making immediately PERIOD Some days I feel like I have no control over my class  but realizing the potential I have to make a difference makes my day Duffy said PERIOD

Without resources to support students schools in innercity areas are struggling to give students the education they will need in todays competitive job market PERIOD If students dont have health care nutrition and support at home their needs further burden schools PERIOD

Kids from these communities can be three or four grade levels behind by age nine  that means that a student may only have a kindergartenlevel education when he or she is in third grade PERIOD As a result years later members of lowincome communities are seven times less likely to graduate from college PERIOD

Although their work is difficult according to www.teachforamerica.org  percent of the corps members remain in education PERIOD The aim of the program is not only to have an immediate impact in the classrooms of urban America but also to create a community of socially conscious individuals who will continue working to increase the quality of education throughout their lives PERIOD

The biggest goal is to make an immediate impact through the schools by making corps teachers two years effective and then getting them excited about instituting social change from the field of their major Nally said PERIOD

After last years recruitment meeting there were  applicants PERIOD Applicants for the program this year must be graduating in the spring semester maintain a . gPA and display humility and goal setting throughout their college career PERIOD

So much comes down to the fact that were looking for leaders leaders who will come into the classroom and make a difference Nally said PERIOD
