The Loyola Ramblers beat the Northern Iowa Panthers  in the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament quarterfinals on March  PERIOD

Now that we have had time to reflect on the  college basketball season I wanted to start by looking at the Missouri Valley Conference PERIOD

You can point to Sister Jean Porter Moser the Kansas City brothers Ben Richardson and Clayton Custer or the lack of a top team but LoyolaChicago and the MVC took the world by storm during March Madness PERIOD

A question surrounded the conference the entire  season  especially early on PERIOD After the departure of Wichita State last season one question remained Could the Valley still keep its reputation as one of the best midmajor conferences in the country

In the Valleys preseason rankings Missouri State was the favorite to fill the void in the NCAA tournament with senior star Alize Johnson and four returning starters PERIOD However when the Bears tanked midseason the conference which was already up for grabs was confidently snagged by LoyolaChicago PERIOD

Though this wasnt the Creighton or Wichita State teams of the past PERIOD There was still so much uncertainty in terms of how good the Ramblers truly were PERIOD In fact if Loyola fell in Arch Madness they likely wouldnt have even made the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

The conference ended the year as one of three with all of its teams ranked above  in RPI along with the Big  and SEC PERIOD

Every Monday during the college basketball season the MVC held a conference call with each head coach in the conference and the amount of times the coaches said no game in the Missouri Valley Conference is easy was uncountable PERIOD

So tough that LoyolaChicago was still questioned in the middle of January PERIOD

Why

The Custer and Richardsonless Ramblers through five days at the start of the Missouri Valley season started with two losses in their first three conference games PERIOD

Fast forward a couple more weeks when the two starting guards returned from injury and the Ramblers were beginning to turn the heads of many in the conference PERIOD

But were they legit

They proved to be but there was really no way to tell until Jan PERIOD  through Jan PERIOD  when the Ramblers won five straight games by a combined  points PERIOD

After a 23point beat down of Northern Iowa the Ramblers laid an egg at Bradley and lost PERIOD

The conferences best team wasnt in the AP Top  for the first time in recent memory PERIOD So the clouding question about the MVCs reputation from the beginning of the season was legit PERIOD

After the loss the Ramblers were the first conference leader to not be in the Top  since Missouri State led the conference in the  season when the Valley received one bid PERIOD In  the Bears finished the season as the highest RPI ranking that didnt make the NCAA tournament since the ranking was established PERIOD

Loyola wouldnt lose another game until its season ending loss to Michigan in the Final Four on March  PERIOD The week before the seasons end was the first time the Ramblers were ranked in the Top  PERIOD

The Missouri Valley had to prove itself to the nation PERIOD It took a run to the Final Four to reassure everyone the Valley once again  this time more telling  is for real PERIOD

Conference RPI rankings showed the Valley as one of the eight best conferences in the nation the entire  season PERIOD

The toughest part about judging a midmajors legitimacy is not truly knowing how good teams are PERIOD

The setup of college basketball only allows small midmajors to play Power Five conference teams at the beginning of the year PERIOD And when a team is being judged on legitimacy the first question you ask is Who have they beat

Loyola beat No PERIOD  Florida earlier in the season on Dec PERIOD  so there is that the Ramblers already proved themselves PERIOD

But again that added to the answer that the Valleys best are good enough to compete at the highest level PERIOD

The Valleys best have consistently proven themselves in postseason play as well PERIOD

No Valley team has lost a firstround game in the NCAA Tournament since  with the league going a whopping  through the stretch PERIOD

Since  the Valley has the best record of any conference in the NCAA NIT CIT and CBI tournaments combined PERIOD

Since  the Valley has had  teams seeded lower than ninth including Loyolas  seed this season PERIOD Those teams have combined for seven Sweet  and two Final Four appearances PERIOD

To add to the craze both Final Four appearances came in the past five years PERIOD The percent of the Valleys Final Four appearances to the amount of bids theyve received is superior to every conference in the nation PERIOD

I dont mean to portray the Valley as top in the nation rather the underrated power it has been PERIOD

Many in the Springfield community tend to underestimate it too PERIOD Missouri State students included PERIOD

It is time to start boasting Valley basketball as a larger part in the community PERIOD

Its been a winning recipe in the conference in its successful time PERIOD

Loyola head coach Porter Moser pointed to the help Chicago gave Loyola after the buzz was created PERIOD Wichita State sold out arenas after a rebuild with head coach Gregg Marshall PERIOD When a community surrounds energy is created and teams get better PERIOD

Missouri State head coach Dana Ford pointed to this in his experience coaching for Marshall at Wichita State and making it a principle of the future PERIOD

Our entire university we have to change or mindset when it comes to mens basketball PERIOD When the word championship is brought up weve got to be about that PERIOD That has to be our expectation PERIOD ...When I was hired at Wichita State as a graduate assistant we were on the bottom PERIOD When I went back as an assistant coach they had changed it around and brought it all the way back up to the top. so where should you look from here

The next step is seeing who takes The Valley crown in  PERIOD Does Loyola regin the new kings of the Missouri Valley Conference or is there room for someone with the mindset of Fords

The nation will be watching searching for a product that proves the conference belongs PERIOD
