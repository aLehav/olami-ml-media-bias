Coming to Penn State as highly touted freshmen recruits Merritt Krawczyk Amy Modglin and Paige Whitmire knew that a lot would be expected of them to perform to the best of their abilities PERIOD

But dont expect any of them to crack under the pressure of having high expectations to live up to PERIOD

 Krawczyk said PERIOD 

Through the first two meets of the Penn State womens swimming teams young season these three blue chip recruits have swum like veterans especially in the first meet against St PERIOD Bonaventure PERIOD

Krawczyk finished almost six seconds ahead of second place in the  breaststroke Modglin cruised to an easy victory in the  backstroke and Whitmire clocked in the best time of the event in the  freestyle PERIOD

But these finishes werent just results of racing what some would consider an earlyseason  team PERIOD

This past weekends meet against talented West Virginia out of the Big East and backtoback Patriot League champion Colgate proved that the freshman could hang with the best PERIOD

Modglin was a double winner in individual meets turning in top times in the  IM and the  backstroke PERIOD Whitmire contributed to two firstplace finishes for the home team in both the  medley and  freestyle relay events PERIOD And Krawczyk finished with the Lions secondbest time in the  breaststroke and also contributed to one of the firstplace relay efforts PERIOD

 Whitmire said PERIOD

So far these three have done just that PERIOD

But the transition from the easily dominated high school swimming scene to the challenging and extremely talented world of collegiate swimming hasnt been as easy as it might appear for the decorated freshmen PERIOD

 Modglin said PERIOD 

With grueling practices every day and big meets every week racing for a highly competitive Division I team the three are quickly realizing that the level of competition at the college level is far more advanced than high school PERIOD

 Krawcyzk said PERIOD

As difficult as it has been for the trio theyre beginning to find ways to overcome the hardships brought on by the major changes PERIOD

Having such a strong support system from the rest of the team has proved to be the most effective for them all PERIOD

 Modglin said PERIOD 

While still a bit confused and overwhelmed theyre all equally focused on achieving big things this season and getting there the right way PERIOD

 Modglin said PERIOD 

But dont expect their aspirations to stop there PERIOD

 Whitmire added PERIOD
