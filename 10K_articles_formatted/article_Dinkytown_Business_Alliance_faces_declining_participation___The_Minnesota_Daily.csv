5022,2023-11-04,"new and longtime Dinkytown business owners have mixed feelings about the business organization PERIOD

by  Arianna ValenzuelaZazuetaPublished  October  

The Dinkytown Business Alliance is struggling to bring new businesses into the fold PERIOD

The Alliance and its predecessor the Dinkytown Business Association have existed for the last  years PERIOD The Alliances mission is to strengthen the business climate of the Dinkytown commercial area but it has seen declining interest from local businesses with some disagreeing with the way its run PERIOD

Its a challenge to keep our community business members engaged said DBA President Randy Gast PERIOD Its an ongoing challenge because everybody is so busy. the alliance continues to struggle with remaining relevant Gast said PERIOD Plus decreased membership leads to less funding for the organization he said PERIOD

You dont collect dues you dont have enough money to do things Gast said but added DBA also receives funding from grants PERIOD

Community engagement and collaboration between businesses are strengthened when DBA has more members he said PERIOD

Greg Pillsbury owner of Burrito Loco was a former president and member of the DBA for nearly  years PERIOD He is no longer a member due to other obligations PERIOD

DBA is a reliable resource for information he said particularly for new business owners that have issues or questions PERIOD

Theres a lot of benefits to joining Pillsbury said PERIOD Its really helpful to stay informed. but other Dinkytown business owners say theyve steered away from DBA due to its organizational model PERIOD

Left Click Lounge owner Ryan Christianson is a new member of the community who said he has no interest in joining DBA PERIOD

Theres no incentive in paying to join the alliance he said adding that he would only join if all businesses are equally ranked. it should be a club where  if you do pay it should be very affordable Christianson said PERIOD From a business owners point of view theres not much incentive to group with your competitors. pete Jacobson owner of Lands End Pasty Company said DBA doesnt promote all businesses equally PERIOD

DBA has done a fair job of promoting the area to students and protecting the interests of businesses Jacobson said PERIOD However I dont feel that smaller businesses are represented as well as they could be in the DBA. gast said DBA strives to adequately represent all businesses in the neighborhood PERIOD

Any inconsistencies in representation are unintentional he said but added DBA could do a better job of reaching out to new businesses PERIOD

The unfortunate reality is that if youre a single small operator in Dinkytown and you look around it looks like the big names are the ones who are doing stuff Gast said PERIOD

Lee Sayt owner of The Cove said he would like to join the alliance to network with other businesses and brainstorm how to boost Dinkytowns reputation PERIOD

But Sayt said there has been a lack of communication on how to join the alliance PERIOD

I dont even know how to get involved with DBA he said PERIOD

Gast suggested business owners who want to join the alliance should contact him through the DBA website PERIOD

Sometimes we dont get to everybody Gast said PERIOD If people want to join or want to talk about it call me PERIOD Contact me through the website. correction A previous version of this article misstated the age of the Dinkytown Business Alliance PERIOD Both it and its predecessor the Dinkytown Business Association have operated in the neighborhood for  years PERIOD
