The mens soccer team has experienced reaching the pinnacle when they were ranked No PERIOD  in the country and worked its way to the national championship game in  and falling short as they did last season being eliminated in the first round of the NCAA Championships in Dallas Texas by the University of New Mexico PERIOD

The team ended its  season with a  record PERIOD

We have an experienced club with good additions head coach Karl Kremser said when speaking about his teams outlook PERIOD

The winner of the conference now gets an automatic bid into the tournament PERIOD We expect to win the conference the coach confidently stated PERIOD

Kremser knows talent when he sees it PERIOD The coach has been in his profession for over  years and is now in his twenty-third season with the Golden Panthers PERIOD Additionally Kremser boasts a  record PERIOD

While FIU was a Division II program Kremser led his teams to four national championship game appearances winning two PERIOD

We expect a lot from guys like Matias Asorey Roy Rosenberg Ezequiel Romero and Hendrix Emanuel PERIOD We also have a transfer coming in Mark Stevenson who we tried to recruit earlier and now we have him. asorey played in all nineteen matches last season starting eighteen PERIOD  He finished with a teamleading eight goals and nineteen points PERIOD

Rosenberg had  saves as the squads goalkeeper in  PERIOD

Romero was second on the team with four goals PERIOD

Emanuel played in nine games in a reserve role PERIOD

The road to a conference title and a bid into the NCAA tourney wont be easy PERIOD

The team will hit the road to  face Fullerton and UCLA in California and travel for contests against William and Marys and St PERIOD Johns University in New York PERIOD

Those matchups are all in the first two weeks of the season Kremser said PERIOD UCLA is ranked in the top  every year PERIOD Playing them will be a true test. kremser remains confident even with the early challenges lying ahead.Were looking forward to a good year. your email address will not be published PERIOD
