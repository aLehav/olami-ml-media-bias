Fiddlehead a new soup and salad store is slated to open on West College Avenue around the Thanksgiving holiday  but its opening will affect more than just downtown State Colleges dining options PERIOD

Our focus is fresh and local ingredients so well be sourcing local farmers and trying to get as much product as we can from them Fiddlehead manager Caleb Selders Class of  said PERIOD This is the first and only soup and salad caf of its kind. fiddlehead is expected to open late November at  W PERIOD College Ave. replacing Chocolate Madness which closed in late July Selders said PERIOD The store will be east of Herwigs Austrian Bistro  W PERIOD College Ave. and west of Spectacles F.Y PERIOD Eye  W PERIOD College Ave PERIOD

The singlefloor  squarefoot store is the brainchild of Irvings coowners Marya Schoenholtz her husband David Schoenholtz and his twin brother Jack Schoenholtz PERIOD The owners assure potential customers that Fiddlehead will be completely different than the downtown lunch scene they have run together for more than  years PERIOD

Everything will be made from scratch truly from scratch  scratch Selders said PERIOD Just not the gelato. fiddlehead will feature five daily soups made from fresh stock PERIOD Customers will also be able to choose from six salads on the menu or create their own PERIOD And the restaurant will feature four Pennsylvaniamade gelato flavors Selders said PERIOD

Our plan is that if you order soup today we made it today in our own kitchen he said adding that the restaurant will be open for lunch and dinner PERIOD

Felix Weigel sophomorepolitical science said he enjoys eating soup and salad for lunch and was getting frustrated with the little variety that businesses in town offer PERIOD

All I can eat is HUB soup and its always the same he said PERIOD The best option in this town is Olive Garden and thats far PERIOD So Fiddleheads close proximity to campus is a plus. what will stay similar to Irvings  E PERIOD College Ave. is the structure of the stores interior which will be made mostly from renewable resources like bamboo pressed sorghum halls and other plants Selders said PERIOD

Another key difference will be that the utensils and plateware will be recycled material PERIOD

We wont have plastic or paper items that havent been recycled and everything that consumers get will be compostable Selders said PERIOD We should attract a wide variety of people both students and professionals with the way people are during lunchtime downtown. the Borough of State College does not have a composting program but only a pilot program that is due to expire soon that goes to certain neighborhoods to compost materials and see how it benefits the area Selders said PERIOD He added that he and the three coowners of Fiddlehead are hoping their composting efforts in the new eatery will have a positive influence on the Borough to make equal attempts in this green movement PERIOD

Were pushing them to make the composting program a more permanent program Selders said PERIOD

Kallie Hartman freshmancommunication sciences and disorders is a frequent Irvings patron and said she is excited to see what the store will do with another business PERIOD

Not a whole lot of places will be gutsy and go completely compostable she said PERIOD

Unlike Irvings Fiddlehead plans to reach customers through social media via its website Twitter and Facebook PERIOD The restaurant also plans to use scanable QR codes to list daily specials and the five featured soups he said PERIOD

Were trying to be as cutting edge as we can be Selders said PERIOD

Installation of new counters countertops and flooring at the Fiddlehead location began just a couple of weeks ago PERIOD The store will also start accepting job applications in a couple of weeks Selders said PERIOD

Im excited for the opening he added PERIOD
