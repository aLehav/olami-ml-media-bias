Madison City Council signed off on the new Gordon Commons and adopted a resolution declaring Madison a Fair Trade city at their meeting Tuesday night PERIOD

The City Councils approval of the new Gordon Commons was the final step toward making the project official PERIOD

The project represents a significant development of a new dining facility for Southeast area residents Ald PERIOD Bryon Eagon District  said PERIOD Long term it comes with a new open space in the campus core downtown that is greatly needed. the new facility will be built on the current empty space next to Gordon Commons PERIOD A larger open space will then be developed where the current building is PERIOD

Another change to the dining hall includes removing the connecting bridge to the Witte dormitory Eagon said PERIOD The entrance to Witte will be steered more toward Johnson Street to promote pedestrian traffic there instead of across Lake Street PERIOD

The project is a positive development Eagon said PERIOD Its a new state of the art facility with needed improvements and more open space. the City Council also passed a resolution that designated Madison a Fair Trade city recognizing the efforts of Wisconsin Student Public Interest Research Groups Fair Trade Committee PERIOD

Madison has now become the sixteenth Fair Trade City in the country PERIOD WISPIRGs Fair Trade Committee has been working with city members for over two years to make the resolution a reality UW sophomore and committee member Erica Symonds said PERIOD

The passage of the resolution pinpoints Madison as a leader in Fair Trade business Symonds said PERIOD

The resolution encourages city businesses to purchase Fair Trade products like coffee tea and sugar PERIOD Ald PERIOD Mike Verveer District  said the eventual goal is to move from encouraging city businesses to requiring Fair Trade product purchase by law PERIOD

Although the resolution also encourages private businesses to purchase Fair Trade products Verveer said the focus is to make city establishments like the Monona Terrace and the Overture Center Fair Trade businesses PERIOD

In a letter to the council the WISPIRG Committee said the use of Fair Trade products aids poor farmers in developing countries by providing a marketplace for their goods in Madison PERIOD

Verveer said the resolution follows the sweatshopfree trend UW has been working toward PERIOD He added the resolution complements Chancellor Biddy Martins Friday announcement ending the universitys relationship with Nike PERIOD

The Fair Trade organization only associates with sweatshop free work places PERIOD According to the letter the organization is a viable option for businesses that does not exploit people or the environment PERIOD

Verveer said the concept is nothing new to the city as over  local businesses currently sell Fair Trade products PERIOD The resolution the WISPIRG Committee lobbied for is a step toward transforming Madison into more of a Fair Trade city PERIOD

There may be some monetary impact on city agencies as they consider Fair Trade products but the overall impact is likely small the resolution said PERIOD

Becoming a Fair Trade business helps provide a fair living wage for producers and healthy labor conditions Symonds said PERIOD
