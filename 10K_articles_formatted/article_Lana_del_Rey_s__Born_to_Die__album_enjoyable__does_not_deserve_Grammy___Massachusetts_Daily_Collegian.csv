Somewhere amidst the roar of controversy that followed her cringeinducing Saturday Night Live performance Lana del Rey managed to release her first album PERIOD Born to Die a record that plays like a soundtrack to Instagram is the current target of hateful hipsters tomatothrowing PERIOD In fact the online frenzy of revulsion is so potent its surprising torchwielding mobs of Pitchfork bloggers havent mowed her down by now PERIOD

That said if one just looks at the album and not the persona of the artist singing it Born to Die is not terrible PERIOD Not by a longshot PERIOD Most of the songs are downright enjoyable and even the ones that dont merit praise arent completely painful to listen to PERIOD

The album begins with the title track Born to Die. this is the kind of song that would play during a reconciliation scene on a teen soap opera PERIOD Del Reys voice lends a certain melodrama that is well matched to the apocalyptic lyrics PERIOD Evoking imminent death set to a sweeping orchestra this song sets a beautifully ominous tone for the rest of the album PERIOD

Off to the Races an Alice in Wonderlandesque track that features del Rey in a more docile role is equally engaging PERIOD In Races del Rey channeling a Lolita of sorts describes her dysfunctional relationship with an older man PERIOD Despite the peppy even squeaky voice del Rey uses Races is just as foreboding as its predecessor PERIOD

Keeping up with the increasingly dark album is Blue Jeans. this song isnt nearly as beguiling as Born or Races but it keeps up the haunting vibe PERIOD Del Reys voice perhaps inhibited by her Angelina Jolielike lips sounds muffled and overly synthetic on this track  a contrived sound that comes off as gimmicky PERIOD

Video Games a beautifully executed tale of a notquiteright relationship is by far the most notable song on the album PERIOD Backed by harps and a full string section Video Games is the first song that doesnt sound like an accompaniment to a night of drinking cheap wine and crying in the shower PERIOD Del Reys disaffected lamentation clashes provocatively with the almost daisiesandsunshine orchestration resulting in a mesmeric almost ethereal power PERIOD This unsurprisingly is the standout track of the album PERIOD

Unfortunately the following song is an utterly forgettable tune entitled Diet Mountain Dew that cuts the selfdeprecating fascination as quickly as it started PERIOD There isnt anything wrong with the song nor is there anything remarkable about it PERIOD Additionally the lyrics yet again weave a tale of a dysfunctional relationship PERIOD One song about an awful relationship or even emotional abuse can garner critical acclaim for tackling a heavy subject PERIOD An entire album of them just invites eyerolling PERIOD

At this point the huskyvoiced vintage guise becomes grating PERIOD The grainy music videos the quirky sound clips and the melancholy tone that permeates the entire album gets extremely tired after just a few songs PERIOD Del Reys shtick seems to be entirely composed of sulking Polaroids and liquid eyeliner which is fine but a whole album where the manufactured image is so transparent is almost insulting PERIOD

The rest of the album blends together in a blur of murmurs and melodramatic orchestral backgrounds PERIOD It is fine for an artist to have a distinctive sound but when every song on one album sounds almost exactly the same both in sound and content one has to doubt the creativity of the artist PERIOD

One last standout however is Summertime Sadness. yes del Rey even manages to turn the quintessential blissful dog days into a period of mourning PERIOD For what Given the past material maybe a romantic relationship with a much older man gone wrong PERIOD Nevertheless the song is pretty and whimsically gloomy PERIOD

Born to Die does not deserve a Grammy but it does not deserve a raging mob of pitchforkwielding haters either PERIOD What Lana del Rey does deserve apparently is a prescription for Valium and some sunshine PERIOD Her sound is decent and occasionally catchy but the lyrics and tone need to diversify to be taken more seriously PERIOD
