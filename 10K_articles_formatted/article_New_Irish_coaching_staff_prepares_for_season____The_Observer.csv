Zach Klonsinski  Tuesday January  

Irish head coach Brian Kelly officially introduced the plethora of new faces coming to the Irish coaching staff for the  seasonMonday PERIOD

We made quite a few changes Kelly said PERIOD Its important to certainly look at where you are where you were and for me I know Im going to always be reminded about last year and I clearly understand that PERIOD

Having said that there always are going to be changes when you look hard and look at yourself and look at where your program needs to be and we fell short of all those goals. after Kelly fired Brian VanGorder midseason finding a new defensive coordinator was at the top of the todo list with Kelly stating he was specifically looking for someone who could force turnovers PERIOD

Kelly found his answer in Wake Forest defensive coordinator Mike Elko PERIOD

Mike Elko one of only two defensive coordinators in the nation  to have a unit in the top  in total defense in the last five years at Wake and Bowling Green Kelly said PERIOD There were three teams that took the ball away as many times 20plus times It was Clemson Alabama and Wake Forest. the biggest thing that were going to try to do is were going to try to put our kids in positions to be successful at what they do Elko said of his scheme PERIOD   Its an adjustable scheme that we constantly evaluate what positions are we putting our kids in what are we going to ask them to be able to do this week and can they do it. greg Hudson took over the position on an interim basis last season and was given an interview Kelly said PERIOD Ultimately the head coach decided to go in another direction but he said he is still looking intopotentially finding a place for Hudson on the staff PERIOD

Elko brings Clark Lea as his linebackers coach the position Lea held under Elko at Wake Forest PERIOD

Hes a great coach and I think he can coach this scheme really well Elko said of Lea PERIOD With our ability and our need to get this thing going quickly hell do a great job helping with that. kelly said Mike Elston Notre Dames linebackers coach last season will move to the defensive line and also retain his position as recruiting coordinator PERIOD

After former offensive coordinator Mike Sanford left to take the head coaching job at Western Kentucky in the offseason Kelly said his priority in the new hire was finding a playcaller. he said the name that kept hanging around was Memphis offensive coordinator Chip Long PERIOD

As I looked around the country I was able to compile a very short list of guys that called plays through my eyes PERIOD In other words the way I like our offense to look Kelly said PERIOD And the guy that kept coming to the top of the list was Chip Long. he didnt rely heavily on a passing game when he was forced to make up ground late in games PERIOD Utilized two tight ends which was going to be a mode that we have to move towards with the great depth that we have at that position. kelly fired former special teams coach Scott Booker in the days after the loss to USC but he said he was able to hit a home run by hiring former Irish assistant Brian Polian who agreed to part ways withNevada at the end of last season PERIOD

Its different in every facet Polian said of returning to special teams coordinator after spending the last four seasons as head coach atNevada PERIOD Its just something that I have to get adjusted to and its no concern PERIOD It will just take a little bit of time  I want to coach football and Im looking forward to doing that again. a familiar face returns with the Irish quarterbacks who Sanford also coached in former quarterback Tom Rees PERIOD

Or is it Tommy

Some of you may know him as Tom Rees Kelly said PERIOD You can call him whatever you like PERIOD I think he would answer to either Tom or Tommy PERIOD But what I like to call him is our quarterbacks coach. technically Kelly said Rees is only a graduate assistant but Kelly said he expects Rees to be in full control of the quarterback room PERIOD

He is fully empowered to coach them Kelly said PERIOD He will have the room PERIOD He will coach those quarterbacks on a daytoday basis. rees joked the campus looks a little different than it did when he graduated three years ago but said he was excited about getting the chance to coach a firstyear quarterback after DeShone Kizer declared for the NFL and Malik Zaire announced his intention to transfer PERIOD

You start with a fresh slate and a group of kids that are really eager to learn and eager to play Rees said of the quarterbacks PERIOD So theyre all ears right now. kelly also introduced DelVaughn Alexander as Notre Dames new receivers coach adding he liked Alexanders organizational skills and experience from Arizona State Wisconsin Oregon State and UNLV PERIOD

Weve got a veteran wide receiver coach wellestablished in his profession and in his interview was extremely detailed and organized in laying out what his role will be in developing our fairly young wide receiving core Kelly said PERIOD

Additionally Kelly named Matt Balis as Notre Dames new strength and conditioning coach after Paul Longo had to step down for health reasons adding Balis comes recommended from former Irish defensive coordinator Bob Diaco PERIOD Balis was on Diacos staff at UConn last season PERIOD

Dave Ballou strength and conditioning Jeff Quinn senior offensive analyst Jeff Burris defensive analyst and Bryce Tracy offensive analyst rounded out the hires Kelly announced Monday PERIOD
