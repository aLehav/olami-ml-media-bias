Colleen Buckley  competed in her final Patriot League Womens Cross Country Championships on Oct PERIOD  where she won the 6k race in a field of  runners PERIOD The highlydecorated senior earned her thirdstraight First Team AllPatriot League honor after her first place finish PERIOD

Buckley and the rest of the competitors raced in grueling conditions making it a hardfought race between the field ofrunners PERIOD

Buckley said For me personally I think the weather actually made the race more funit was a true cross country race where people were racing with heart not racing the clock. not many people find cross country racing to be their first choice of a sport PERIOD However Buckley derives her motivation to train and compete in these meets from a pursuit of improvement PERIOD Having placed fourth in the championships her sophomore season and third her junior year Colleen came into the current season ready to take first place PERIOD

Winning the individual race was my goal coming in to the season but there are some really talented girls in the Patriot League so I knew it wouldnt be a walk in the park Buckley said PERIOD

As the season approaches an end Buckley and the rest of the teamhavefaced several challenges PERIOD Reflecting upon her career as a Bison Buckley has alotof wisdom to offer to theunderclassmen PERIOD

I think the best piece of advice I can give our underclassmen is to try and completely let go of that pressure as odd as that might sound PERIOD Overthinking running takes away the fun of it to a degree Buckley said PERIOD Going into league meets recognizing the significance is important but enjoying the moment and letting the run come to you instead of trying to force it is what makes for the best races. looking forward to the remainder of the season Buckley hopes to take home another first place finish in the upcoming MidAtlantic Regional race hosted by Penn State on Nov PERIOD  PERIOD
