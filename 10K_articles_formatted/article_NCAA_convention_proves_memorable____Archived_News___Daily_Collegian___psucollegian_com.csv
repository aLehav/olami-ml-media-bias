NCAA convention proves memorable

Almost everyone concerned believes that something monumental happened at last weeks special NCAA  in New Orleans PERIOD

 Penn State President Bryce Jordan said recently PERIOD 

Penn State Head Football Coach Joe Paterno said 

University of Texas Athletic Director Deloss Dodds said 

The 44member National Collegiate Athletic Association Presidents Commission passed   propositions designed to cleanse athletic programs of the corruption that has gone unchecked over recent years PERIOD

The commission formed just a year ago called the special convention only the fifth in NCAA history to pass the propositions with a show of force that proves it means business to even the greatest of skeptics PERIOD

Passed at the convention were rules that require annual audits of school athletic budgets annual reporting of academic data penalties that would follow a coach and be held against him even if he moved to another institution and a rule that could cause an athlete to forfeit his eligibility if he knowingly violated an NCAA rule PERIOD

Those however are relatively minor compared to Proposition No PERIOD   

The ruling which passed by an overwhelming vote of  makes it possible for the NCAA to suspend an athletic program for up to two years if it commits the schools second major violation in a fiveyear period PERIOD The program guilty of the second violation would be the only one suspended PERIOD The measure is retroactive to Sept PERIOD   and the second violation would have to occur after Sept PERIOD first of this year PERIOD

Until a reinterpretation of the rule was passed it was worded in a manner that a school curently under investigation could be found guilty of its second violation and the program would be suspended PERIOD Paterno feels that the reinterpretation is the fairest way the rule could be written PERIOD

 Paterno said PERIOD I think thats a fairer way to do it PERIOD Were not taking away the one thats been done  were not wiping the slate clean PERIOD Were not giving them amnesty for the one probation theyve had PERIOD If they do something again theyll have two violations under the fiveyear period PERIOD

Paterno is not worried that his program could be abolished because another team at Penn State had committed a violation within the previous five years PERIOD

 he said PERIOD 

The commission however did not address two issues  a proposal to end freshamn eligibility and one that would change the minimum academic requirements for an athlete to be accepted into college PERIOD The proposal has already been passed but many want to lower the standards PERIOD

Many schools are against the two proposals citing the costs of awarding scholarships and then making the athletes ineligible for a year is an aspect many schools are against PERIOD Others say that requiring a minimum score of  on the Scholastic Aptitude Test is discrimatory against Blacks PERIOD

 Jordan said PERIOD 

Jordan also said that he is in favor of making Proposition  the academic admittance standards as stringent as possible PERIOD He said he is in complete agreement with Paterno on the issue PERIOD

Paterno said that making freshman ineligible would give the athlete a better chance to get adjusted to a college environment PERIOD He admits however that it will take a lot of convincing before the resolution is passed PERIOD

There is talk about ammending Proposition  to make it easier for students to gain admittance to the universities PERIOD Paterno said he would listen to reasonable proposals but does not want to see the guidelines watered down PERIOD

 Paterno said PERIOD If you cant get a kid to get  on his college boards working with him for three and four years on reading and writing skills I dont know whether there is much hope for a kid being able to do well in college. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
