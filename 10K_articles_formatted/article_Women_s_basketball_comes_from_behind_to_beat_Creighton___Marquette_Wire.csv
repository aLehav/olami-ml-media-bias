3190,2023-11-04,"with seconds winding down inside the Al McGuire Center Creighton senior guard Tatum Rembao was searching for a teammate to make the inbound pass while down  PERIOD

Sophomore guard Morgan Maly received Rembaos pass at the top of the key and set herself in hopes of tying the game with a long 3pointer PERIOD But then entered Marquette sophomore forward Liza Karlen PERIOD

Karlen blocked Malys shot securing the Golden Eagles  come from behind victory over the Blue Jays on Play4Kay Day PERIOD

Couldnt be more thrilled about the performance this afternoon beating a really really good Creighton team Marquette head coach Megan Duffy said PERIOD The moral of the story is our defense kept us in the game we made some great plays down the stretch to execute PERIOD

Overall just really thrilled to get this home win on alumni day and as we celebrate the the Black Fives Foundation as well PERIOD A great one for our program. with the win Marquette extends its winning streak to a seasonhigh six games PERIOD

The Golden Eagles hopped out to an early  lead in the opening frame but the Blue Jays responded with a  run to head into the second leading  PERIOD

Creighton got a lot of easy shots that they normally make so to be only down by that honestly was a good thing Duffy said PERIOD Its just when theyve got five players on the floor who can score in different ways it puts a lot of pressure on your defense PERIOD And I think sometimes that then takes your offense a little slower and a little harder to make shots. marquette would get within two at the  mark of the second quarter when Karlen hit a jumper to end a close to three minute scoreless drought PERIOD

Senior forward Chloe Marotta then hit a midrange jumper to tie the game at  PERIOD

Creighton would narrowly outscore Marquette  to end the half to take a  lead into the locker room PERIOD

Despite Marquette going 5for12 from the field in the second quarter along Karlen finished the half making three of her last four shots to lead the team with eight firsthalf points PERIOD

Liza had a great bounce back game from Friday night Duffy said PERIOD Liza has found a really good chemistry to find those short jumper that in a lot of ways feels like layups. the third quarter was a tightly contested frame amongst both teams PERIOD Toward the midway point of the quarter Marotta fed a pass to Karlen for the layup to bring Marquette within one point  PERIOD

Creighton would then control during the final  of the frame PERIOD Both Karlen and Marotta combined to score seven of Marquettes  points in the third alone helping keep the deficit to six heading into the final stanza PERIOD

When theyre face guarding Karissa McLaughlin or double teaming Lauren Van Kleunen Ive got to step up right there Marotta said PERIOD I got to take advantage of what theyre giving me on offense and then also finding my teammate in any way I can. after being held scoreless through the first  minutes junior guard Jordan King got on the board at the  mark of the fourth quarter PERIOD Kings jumper served to be a momentum shifting basket as it forced Creighton to call a timeout after the Golden Eagles trimmed the deficit to  PERIOD

Coming out of the timeout Marquette continued its momentum building the run to  PERIOD Graduate student forward Lauren Van Kleunen put in the second chance opportunity on her missed layup to tie the game at  with  left to go PERIOD

With time winding down in the game Karlen worked the post on her way to hitting a contested jumper to bring Marquette back within one  PERIOD

Then Marquette took its first lead since the first quarter at the  mark of the fourth when King hit a jumper forcing Creighton to call another timeout PERIOD

As the trend has been during the Duffy Era Marquette was able to etch out a victory behind its defensive efforts as the Golden Eagles held the Blue Jays scoreless over the final  PERIOD

Marquette now holds a  record at home this season and is  alltime under Duffy at the Al McGuire Center PERIOD

Karlen put together a stellar performance on the afternoon PERIOD The St PERIOD Paul Minnesota native finished with a teamhigh  points seven rebounds three assists two steals and two blocks PERIOD

Sophomore guard Danyel Middleton missed her second straight game with a nonCOVID related illness PERIOD Duffy said Middleton is daytoday PERIOD

Hurts us a little bit with our bench as shes been playing great Duffy said PERIOD As quickly as we can get to get her back and healed up shell be back out there. it is the tenth time this season that Marquette has held its opponent to under  points PERIOD

With the win the Golden Eagles move into second place of the BIG EAST with a  record PERIOD Marquette will host first place UConn next Sunday at the Al McGuire Center PERIOD

We talk a lot about February focus Marotta said PERIOD Thats been our main goal these last couple weeks talking about how focused you have to be in February every single day day by day PERIOD We knew that today we got to take care of Creighton PERIOD On Friday we had to take care of Providence. marquette   BIG EAST will now travel to Villanova Friday in hopes of splitting the regularseason series PERIOD The game is set for a  p.m PERIOD CST tipoff on FloSports PERIOD
