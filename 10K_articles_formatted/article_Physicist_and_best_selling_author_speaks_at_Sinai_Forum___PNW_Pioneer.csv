Lawrence Krauss theoretical physicist speaks to audience members at the Sinai Forum on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Lawrence Krauss theoretical physicist and founder of Arizona State Universitys Origins Project spoke about the nature of reality and science at the Sinai Forum at the Westville campus on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Krauss is the bestselling author of The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe from Nothing. he explained because many scientific discoveries prove the same thing the world is actually more simple than complex PERIOD

Kraus said that experimental physicist Michael Faraday and later theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell proved electricity and magnetism were the same in the nineteenth century PERIOD Faraday also showed magnetism could create electricity.The two phenomena were already known to be connected because electricity could change the magnetic reactions of a compass PERIOD However Faraday showed magnetism could create electricity PERIOD

That made the modern world possible Krauss said citing the use of magnets in waterfalls to create electricity PERIOD

Later Maxwell created equations showing that all observations of electricity and magnetism can be explained by an electromagnetic field PERIOD However his work led to the discovery of another unification because he found the speed of electromagnetic waves was the speed of light PERIOD

Light which allows us to learn about the world around us is just an electromagnetic wave Krauss said summarizing Maxwells discovery PERIOD

In the twentieth century Albert Einstein unified Maxwells discovery with the apparently contradictory Law of Inertia developed by Galileo Galilei in the seventeenth century PERIOD

The only way they could be true at the same time is if distance and time are relative Krauss said describing the new concept of spacetime PERIOD This world we see this threedimensional world is really a fourdimensional world. this case rebuts a common misunderstanding of science he said PERIOD Whereas some people think scientists are always throwing out old theories and science is therefore pointless to learn scientists finds new ways to align old observations with new ones PERIOD

What satisfies the test of experiment is true PERIOD Its not about your ideology Krauss said PERIOD

Krauss described the unification of light photons mass measurement and the theory of quantum mechanics with superconductivity PERIOD This leads to a possible problem with electromagnetism and normal atoms but the discovery of the Higgs field may be the answer PERIOD

Maybe we live in a superconductor and that would solve this problem he said PERIOD The particles in our bodies are massless on some level. he said the discovery of Higgs particles in the Large Hadron Collider on July   was a date of cosmic significance PERIOD The quest to explain reality now moves in a new direction PERIOD

Sure this Higgs field is there but why is it there Krauss asked PERIOD Every time we make a new discovery it brings new questions. aaron Warren associate professor of physics said he loved Krauss emphasis on the need to continue to ask questions PERIOD Warren said the Higgs field is a major area of research right now and scientists have several exciting ideas PERIOD

Rick Urschel CEO of Urschel Laboratories and a forum sponsor suggested the forum invite Krauss and introduced him at the event PERIOD

You can talk about photons all night long and not even scratch the surface of it but if people stop asking why then were lost Urschel said PERIOD
