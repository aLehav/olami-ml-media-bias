Heres how to get started she explains

 Communicate with a consultant Tarqueno said before an event she sends a hostess packet in the mail containing a catalog order forms for women who might not be able to attend the party invitations and a personal letter detailing what the hostess is to expect from the party PERIOD

I try to reach out to the hostess as often as I can with little tips on what it takes to have a good party

Tarqueno said PERIOD

2Ignore the awkwardness

You just get girls there and I provide all the fun Tarqueno said PERIOD

Tarqueno said she makes sure the party environment is comfortable for women who may not know each other PERIOD She uses games and icebreakers to create a fun atmosphere PERIOD

I expected the party to be really awkward especially because I didnt know everyone who was there said Alexia Tillman a College of DuPage student who has attended a sex toy party PERIOD It ended up being not awkward at all PERIOD I think we all had a really fun time and warmed up to each other really quickly. 3Educate yourself

Tillman said she was impressed with how much she learned about sexual health at the party PERIOD

Tarqueno said learning is part of the party experience PERIOD

My job is to educate women Tarqueno said PERIOD Im there to help them understand that sex is not a crazy topic PERIOD There are things women want to talk to their doctors about but are afraid or uncomfortable discussing and I make it comfortable for them to talk about those things. test the products

Tillman said her favorite part of the party was being able to test the majority of the products Tarqueno brought in her many suitcases PERIOD

I was surprised at how many of the products we were able to test PERIOD Obviously the majority of them were beauty products Tillman said PERIOD I actually cared more about testing the beauty products because like a vibrator is a vibrator PERIOD You know what to do with that already. buy stuff

Tillman said she did not expect to purchase anything at the party but she ended up buying more than a few sprays gels and lotions out of the Pure Romance beauty lines PERIOD
