2861,2006-04-10,"student Governments revolution has moved swiftly over the last  days PERIOD For those who missed it lets recap what has happened so far PERIOD Student Government held its first meeting March  PERIOD Nearly  students turned out to the Rathskellar to witness the historic creation of a government of by and for the students PERIOD Contributing to a renewed interest in campus government Student Government offered any candidate for or member of ASM the chance to declare their solidarity with the students PERIOD Only six ASM hopefuls and representatives signed this contract with the students PERIOD This was final proof that ASM does not care about reform and that Student Government is needed PERIOD

So how should the system change We propose three planks accountability and transparency checks and balances and a reformed segregatedfee policy PERIOD

Accountability can be created by simple common sense measures budgets of student organizations for example will be easily accessible online for anyone to search PERIOD Student Government will also require that every budget is detailed down to line items  everything must be clear PERIOD It will institute an audit system that will go through every student budget every year PERIOD This audit group will guarantee that segregated fees are used properly PERIOD

There must also be transparency PERIOD Student Government will guarantee that each individual representatives votes are listed online PERIOD Only when we know how each representative votes will we be able to truly hold him or her accountable for his or her actions PERIOD Sunshine is the best disinfectant and students must be able to find out exactly where their money is being spent and how their representatives are voting PERIOD

In addition Student Government will institute a clear system of checks and balances PERIOD Every committee chair will be an elected representative PERIOD Student Government will also redefine and streamline the currently murky appeals process PERIOD We propose a clear chain of appeals that has a clear ending PERIOD

And then theres the issue of segregated fees PERIOD To be frank it is the most divisive plank within the committee PERIOD It is not our opinion that student groups should disappear PERIOD Indeed one of UWMadisons greatest assets is the unparalleled number of nonacademic opportunities it offers its undergraduates grad students and staff members alike PERIOD

What we do agree on is the need for an inflationadjusted cap on the portion of segregated fees students have control over PERIOD That our tuition rises by a large percentage every year without fail is an indisputable travesty we should not be in the business of increasing that percentage ourselves PERIOD Weve also spent countless hours debating the merits and downfalls of optin and optout systems whereby students have a more direct say in where their fees go PERIOD

Now that weve brought something to the table its your turn PERIOD While these are our convictions they are only that  our convictions  and do not necessarily reflect what will be written in to a constitution that effectively represents the interests of the student body PERIOD At its core Student Governments mission is to collect massive input coming into the constitutionwriting process PERIOD We want to hear from you PERIOD Attend the upcoming listening sessions PERIOD Drop us an email PERIOD Post a message on our Facebook group PERIOD Comment on our website  www.uwsg.org PERIOD

Be on the lookout for announcements regarding our listening sessions within the week PERIOD
