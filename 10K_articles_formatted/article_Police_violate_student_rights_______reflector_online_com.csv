Generally clear skies PERIOD Low 42F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Recently three Mississippi State University students were charged by MSU Police with disorderly conduct and telephone harassment and were arrested in connection to a threat that led to the evacuation of Allen Hall PERIOD Several articles in The Commercial Dispatch reported this situation and I am outraged at the great injustice committed against these MSU students PERIOD Several MSU students have urged The Reflector to investigate this issue and I agree that MSU deserves to know what is going on PERIOD After contacting one of the students involved in the case to receive permission to investigate this matter I became angry PERIOD Clearly our campus police department has violated the rights of MSU students and we as students are basically at the police departments disposal PERIOD

Qieta Worlds a junior majoring in math education maintains that she was wronged in this case PERIOD Worlds holds that on the morning she made the fateful phone call she received a warning that something bad would happen at  p.m PERIOD in Allen Hall PERIOD Worlds called MSU officials to warn them of what she heard PERIOD

Worlds did the right thing PERIOD What if there had been a bomb in Allen Hall Hundreds of lives could have been lost PERIOD How would Worlds have lived with herself had she not called someone and there had been an actual threat

Worlds holds she was found guilty by MSUs student judicial board PERIOD My concerns in the case deal with the way the students were handled PERIOD It is obvious that these students are being used as an example by our university PERIOD

Based on a statement issued by Meridith Geuder associate director of University Relations Worlds is charged with making the phone call that led to the evacuation while two other students are accused of aiding Worlds in her attempt to disrupt a business by telling students not to go into the building PERIOD It should be obvious to anyone that these students thought there was a need for concern PERIOD Why should they be punished for doing what they thought was right

I understand how important it is for our university to take an assertive stance against false allegations and threats especially in light of recent terrorist attacks but what I do not understand is how our university can punish a student who was trying to do the right thing PERIOD

Worlds indicated that MSU police detective Virginia Rich verbally assaulted her and forced her into making false incriminating statements PERIOD Worlds claims that Rich used excessive profanity and bullied her into a corner PERIOD Regardless of circumstances there is no reason for an officer of the law to verbally assault a student PERIOD

When questioned about Richs conduct MSU Police Chief Thomas Johnson in The Commercial Dispatch stated that if the students feel their rights have been violated they should file a complaint PERIOD What will be done on behalf of these students in the meantime If a student was abused bullied or disrespected by our police what good will a complaint do I dont want a complaint PERIOD I want action taken by our university against that officer PERIOD

I contacted Rich and she said the allegations made against her were absolutely false PERIOD Rich said she approaches each situation as it dictates but that she did not resort to profanity PERIOD

Being that Worlds was tried by the judicial board which consists of a diverse makeup of MSU students Dean Mike White reported that justice had been served PERIOD Deliberation in the case lasted over an hour and Worlds was given every opportunity to present her side of the story PERIOD

If Worlds is correct the MSU Police Department should not be allowed to run amok abusing the rights of students PERIOD Just because we are students at this great university does not mean our rights should not be considered and upheld PERIOD

Johnson in the Oct PERIOD  issue of The Commercial Dispatch taking an official stance said the students could have gone to a resident assistant or to Residence Life PERIOD Thats garbage PERIOD The students thought Allen Hall was going to explode PERIOD What would Sherman the Super RA have done Magically diffused the bomb with his Xray vision

After contacting MSU Police Chief Thomas Johnson Johnson reported that he was not aware of any complaints having been filed against any officers in this particular case PERIOD

If Worlds is correct the message these actions are sending to students is that we should all mind our own business and make no concern over the actions of others PERIOD The message students should get from this is that we need to look out for each other and watch our backs if we have intimidating police officers protecting us PERIOD
