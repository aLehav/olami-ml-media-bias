April   by Nadav Senensieb Leave a Comment

The Georgetown baseball team swept a home doubleheader against the University of Maryland Eastern Shore on April  and now looks ahead to a trip to Big East foe St PERIOD Johns on Friday PERIOD The Hoyas   Big East beat the Hawks  by scores of  and  respectively PERIOD

The Hoyas lost nine of their last  games going into the doubleheader PERIOD Head Coach Pete Wilk admitted it was nice to finally start adding wins to their record again PERIOD

The wins were much needed PERIOD Weve been playing much better as a whole anyway and now its nice to have some wins to show that Wilk said PERIOD

Georgetowns pitching staff led the way against UMES anchored by freshman starters Chris Giordano and Nick Leonard PERIOD Both turned in five innings of solid work allowing three runs or fewer and giving the bullpen a muchneeded rest PERIOD

To me the big story on Tuesday was both starts Wilk said PERIOD Were running on fumes right now as a pitching staff and for Chris and Nick to go out and put up  of the  innings was huge because our guys in that bullpen have pitched a lot PERIOD So for them to put up what they did guys like sophomore pitcher Tim Davis and junior pitcher Matt Hollenbeck only got a tuneup rather than have to put a lot of innings in which we didnt want them to have to do with the game coming up on Friday. as with most of the season the Hoya offense was again jumpstarted by senior first baseman Steve Anderson and sophomore catcher Nick Collins who was recently named to the weekly Big East Honor Roll for his performance against Seton Hall last weekend PERIOD Anderson contributed four base hits and four RBIs against UMES while Collins added three hits and three RBIs of his own PERIOD

Those guys are having fantastic years and I think you have to put junior shortstop Ryan Busch in that group too Wilk said PERIOD Those three are just having monster years for us PERIOD Im scared to think where we would be without them PERIOD And Busch is having a good year defensively too PERIOD He made some unbelievable plays yesterday PERIOD I really dont know where wed be without them. the entire Georgetown lineup contributed at the plate compiling  hits in the two games PERIOD Busch senior leftfielder Patrick Camporini freshman right fielder Joseph Bialkowski and junior third baseman Eric Webber had three base hits apiece as the Hoya offense came through for Wilk PERIOD

It was nice to see Webber get three hits and start to come around offensively PERIOD I thought we did a great job offensively yesterday PERIOD We had timely hitting and every time I looked up there seemed to be a guy on second base Wilk said PERIOD
One of the biggest stories of the last few weeks has been Camporini who with his performance against UMES has now reached base safely in  consecutive games PERIOD Camporini has not been one of the more heralded players this season as Busch Collins and Anderson are all having productive campaigns but he is quietly putting together a very good season PERIOD

I read about the streak and it kind of shocked me because he was hitting around . when we were in Florida and hes come back to Earth recently Wilk said PERIOD I didnt realize it until I heard it the other day PERIOD Even though hes gone through a bit of a lag swinging the bat hes still working his way on base PERIOD Its awesome to see PERIOD Hes a great kid. georgetown now has to prepare for St PERIOD Johns   Big East this weekend in the hopes of improving on its lastplace Big East record PERIOD Sophomore pitcher Matt Smith will start Fridays game for the Hoyas as he looks to add to his fantastic season in which injuries to other players forced him to assume the role of staff ace PERIOD He has an ERA of . on the season and his  record does not do justice to how well he has pitched PERIOD

He pitched a hell of a game at Creighton on Apr PERIOD  where we got beat on a twoout blooper Wilk said PERIOD That was only one start ago and the last start against Seton Hall he pitched well enough for us to win PERIOD But every time Matt goes out and throws theres little room for error because hes going out against the other teams ace PERIOD We have to get him some run support. freshman pitcher David Ellingson will start Saturdays game while Sundays series finale starter has yet to be announced PERIOD Wilk hopes that this threegame stretch against the Red Storm in Queens N.Y. will see the Hoyas recent winning play continue PERIOD

I just want us to keep playing good baseball Wilk said PERIOD I keep going back to the Xavier weekend April  where we gave two games up and thats had an enormously negative impact on where we are in the conference PERIOD We got one win at Seton Hall on April  and if we can get a couple at St PERIOD Johns that would be huge. your email address will not be published PERIOD Required fields are marked
