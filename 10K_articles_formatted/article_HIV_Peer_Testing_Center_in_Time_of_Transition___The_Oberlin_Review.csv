Oberlins HIV Peer Testing has been unable to offer private free HIV tests for the past semester due to statelevel changes in health funding and newlyupdated standard practices around HIV testing PERIOD They anticipate that they will not be able to continue these services until spring  PERIOD

The state level changes affect the groups ability to utilize the Ohio Department of Healths resources to confirm positive test results PERIOD Oberlin HIVPT has historically only been able to perform oral HIV tests which are slightly less accurate than blood tests PERIOD Oral tests can produce false positives or inconclusive results meaning a consequent blood test must be used to confirm results PERIOD

Previously in the case of a positive result we would reach out to the Disease Intervention Specialist for Lorain County said HIVPT CoCoordinator and College junior Sadie Munter PERIOD But now that policies have shifted that is no longer going to be a possibility PERIOD They are moving towards encouraging those who do testing to have their own capabilities to have confirmatory testing and connect people to care. before the change the state allocated one DIS per county PERIOD Now there will only be one DIS per every five counties PERIOD

All of our tests are considered preliminary positives because of type of test we use said HIVPT Co Coordinator and College senior Joey FlegelMishlove PERIOD If we ever get a test that comes up reactive we have to do another confirmatory test PERIOD And because we havent been allowed to use blood tests as students and a confirmatory test has to be a blood test weve had to bring in someone else to do that confirmatory test. under new policies HIV testing programs are expected to perform their own confirmatory tests PERIOD Oberlin peer testers have spent the last semester trying to determine a path forward for the organization PERIOD

We realized that we are not comfortable continuing testing until we can find a way to get students connected to a confirmatory blood test in the same day as their initial test should the initial test be reactive FlegelMishlove wrote in an email to the Review PERIOD We are working with several groups  to establish the relationships and resources we need to make this a reality PERIOD In the meantime we cannot continue testing knowing that we are not providing Oberlin students the best care possible. one option is to have students administer a fingerprick test PERIOD However this presents several difficulties including receiving approval from the College additional training and ensuring peer testers comfort with blood PERIOD

Additionally HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva but switching to a blood test could expose peer testers to a slight risk of transmission PERIOD

Best practice guidelines have also changed to encourage groups like Oberlin HIVPT to deliver results within the same appointment PERIOD Previously after a student would come to the peer testers to receive an oral HIV test they then had to schedule a second appointment to pick up their results PERIOD

Oberlins HIV Peer Testing Center does not receive funding from the Ohio Department of Health and are not required to follow this guideline however they still view it as an important goal of the organization PERIOD

There is a chance that somebody could have a reactive test and not come back for their result appointment FlegelMishlove said PERIOD We would have this information about them that we would need to get to them but we would have no way of  getting it to them because most of our tests are anonymous. college firstyear Zo Martin del Campo also views this as an important change for the testers because when she got tested she received inconclusive results PERIOD She got a call from the school telling her she would need to be retested by the DIS PERIOD

Receiving results immediately definitely would have been nice at least for my experience Martin del Campo said PERIOD It was scary just because I didnt know what was going to happen. currently the group is discussing a partnership with Student Health Services to arrange confirmatory testing PERIOD However FlegelMishlove explains that this too presents challenges PERIOD

Student Health would need to get trained to do rapid tests but the main problem with Student Health is that they dont feel like they have the capacity to take that on FlegelMishlove said PERIOD It would require them to be on call whenever we are open  and they have a pretty small staff and they often have people in appointments with them. other options include sending students to Mercy Allen Hospital but FlegelMishlove is hesitant about this PERIOD

We know so many students have had really bad experiences at Mercy Allen Hospital FlegelMishlove said PERIOD We are not particularly excited about that idea PERIOD  We also like that all of our tests are free and we want to keep that a part of our mission and we arent sure what it would cost if we directed students to the hospital. though the inhouse HIV testing will be discontinued until a solution can be found the group has plans to provide resources in alternative ways PERIOD Last Thursday members of the Lorain County Health Department came to campus to administer tests PERIOD Over the next few semesters HIVPT hopes to bring in more outside testers PERIOD The group also hopes to focus on educational efforts including bringing in speakers and hosting events on drugs that can lower the chance of contracting HIV either before or after exposure to the virus such as PrEP and PEP PERIOD
