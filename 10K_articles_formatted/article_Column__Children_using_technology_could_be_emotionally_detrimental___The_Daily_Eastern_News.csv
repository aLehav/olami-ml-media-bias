Today it is normal for a  year old to have a smart phone a tablet a laptop and an iPod PERIOD



I remember the day I handed my 2yearold nephew an old flip phone for him to play with PERIOD

He immediately swiped his finger across the screen and was confused when the phone didnt respond PERIOD

I am not sure what was more terrifying the fact that he had no idea how to use a regular phone or the fact that he knew how to unlock a smart phone PERIOD

Either way that instance made me question quite a few things PERIOD What will our generation of children be like when technology is so easily accessible

I fear that future generations who are consumed by technology will lack confidence and will be emotionally compromised PERIOD

Will our children grow up associating happiness with what they put on their profile online Will they have any idea how to feel emotions when they are glued to a screen most of their life

I understand that many of us watched TV as children but it worries me to see how children are brought up today PERIOD

Everywhere they go there is a screen PERIOD There are televisions at home in the car at school at gas stations and pretty much anywhere else you can think of PERIOD They are given tablets and cell phones to play with instead of something that can help them learn PERIOD

Call me weird but I did this crazy thing as a kid called looking out the window during car rides PERIOD I preferred climbing trees and playing in dirt rather than watching a movie or playing my lovely Playstation  PERIOD

Children can learn something by being outside and interacting with other humans and I doubt they learn anything about life when they worry about how many likes their status got on Facebook PERIOD

When we were young at least we got in a few years of being technologyfree PERIOD We played with toys and played outside and just had fun with other kids our age PERIOD

Whats happening now is a crisis PERIOD

Children have to be entertained at all times and can barely leave their parents side without having a fit PERIOD Instead of teaching them a lesson parents will turn on some kind of screen to distract them PERIOD What are they learning from this

Even though technology is a beautiful thing especially for us college students I think we need to think twice when children become a factor in our lives PERIOD

Turn off the TV and tell your child to go outside and learn something PERIOD Teach them that profiles and websites do not equate to happiness and success human interaction and real experiences do PERIOD
