As a chapter we would like to extend our sincere appreciation for your outstanding response to our Annual Golden Key Pine Street Inn Clothing Drive Your response was so generous that we have made clothing drops to Pine Street once a week Though our clothing drive has formally ended as a chapter we would like to encourage you to continue to donate clothes and food to the Pine Street Inn Shelter at  Harrison Ave the loading dock on Paul Sullivan Way which accepts donations year round PERIOD

As a society Golden Key has resolved to focus our community efforts in the struggle to end homelessness PERIOD Though we are recognized for our strong academic performance Golden Key places a higher value on the mission of improving the lives of those in our own communities PERIOD This year we have already had an impact on our community through our participation in UMass Bostons Orientation the tremendous September eleventh Memorial of Hope Ceremony our Annual Lupus Walk on the Charles our TrickorCan food drive assisting the ARMS Center in feeding four families for Thanksgiving and now our Pine Street Inn Clothing Drive PERIOD

Throughout the remainder of this academic year you will see our chapter engaging in activities that will help to combat homelessness we welcome any suggestions you may have for activities and encourage the entire campus to join in our efforts PERIOD

Thank you again for your generous support

Sincerely

The UMass Boston Chapter of Golden Key International Honour Society
