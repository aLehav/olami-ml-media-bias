2780,2003-01-17,"when Yoda announced the commencement of a clone war few in the movie audience took him seriously PERIOD But last month when a British biotech company announced it had sponsored the first successful birth of a cloned human being moviegoers had to reconsider their skepticism PERIOD A cloned human population seemed to be at least one small step closer to becoming reality PERIOD

However when scientists began to examine the extraordinary claims of Brigitte Boisselier and her company Clonaid it soon became apparent that the supposed birth probably had more to do with fiction than with fact PERIOD Clonaid refused to present solid evidence of its feat and rumors began to surface that the company was backed by a religious cult the Raelians whose goals include creating human clones in an effort to achieve immortality PERIOD

Alta Charo a University of Wisconsin medical ethicist confirmed the unlikelihood of the companys declarations and talked about recently attending a forum with Boisselier PERIOD

She made claims that she was doing biological tests on embryos Charo said PERIOD The problem was that those tests cant be done on embryos PERIOD Clonaid has no technical qualifications. the Raelians  the group that funds Clonaid  was founded in  by a French journalist known today as Rael PERIOD Rael says he came into contact with Elohim an alien who claims he created the human race by cloning people from his own genetic makeup PERIOD

According to Raels recollection Elohim contacted him to request an embassy be built for the Raelians upon his return to the earth with his prophets Jesus Muhammad Moses and Buddha PERIOD

Peter Sobol a UW honorary fellow in the history of science department would not classify the Raelians as members of a valid religion but rather as a cult group PERIOD Like other cult groups Rael takes aim at those most vulnerable to new and farfetched beliefs and takes advantage of them Sobol said PERIOD

Its this category of people that starts a scam and then starts to believe it themselves PERIOD Rael is in that group PERIOD They never had a huge following and mostly they seem to reap personal benefits said Sobol who compared Rael to other cult groups that have existed in the United States and are famous for bizarre beliefs and sometimes coming to violent ends PERIOD

Rael joins a line of people who have claimed to have been contacted by space people Sobol said PERIOD He also pointed out the groups known engagement in exploitative sexual acts with women PERIOD

Charo further questioned Clonaids credentials in conducting scientific research PERIOD

They have no technical qualifications she said PERIOD Their lab was not reflective of proper scientists. while Clonaids and the Raelians inability to produce tangible evidence of a cloned human have caused them to lose face in the worlds scientific community they have achieved at least one goal of their endeavor increasing international discussion on both the technology and ethics behind cloning PERIOD This has sparked heated debate between those who argue for the potential scientific breakthroughs and those who perceive the act of cloning living beings as crossing an ethical line and violating religious values PERIOD Or quite simply playing God PERIOD

Sciences say



The process of cloning begins when a surrogate egg cell is prepared by first removing that cells nucleus PERIOD A genetically enhanced nucleus from a desired clone cell  containing the entirety of the clones critical DNA  is then inserted into the egg cell PERIOD After some electric stimulation the hybrid egg cellnucleus begins to divide and if the process succeeds the clone can continue to develop into a human fetus PERIOD

While Clonaid declined to provide any evidence of the existence of their cloned fetus for fear of losing possession of what they claim is a cloned child other scientists have already proven their ability to clone living organisms PERIOD

In February  scientists at the Roslin Institution in Scotland were able to clone a sheep named Dolly PERIOD The process was hardly smooth PERIOD More than  surrogate mothers attempted to host the cloned embryo before Dolly was actually born PERIOD

The Roslin Institutions low success rate was atypical for the industry in attempts to clone animals only  percent to  percent actually survived until adulthood PERIOD Since Dollys birth scientists have cloned everything from mice to cattle PERIOD

While scientists have been hardpressed to perfect fullhuman cloning a technique called therapeutic cloning is already welldeveloped PERIOD Therapeutic cloning follows the same initial procedure as reproductive cloning but rather than forming an embryo various body cells are created PERIOD By either taking cells from a specific body site or by adding chemicals scientists can produce essentially any type of cell PERIOD

Banning cry



Since the discovery of cloning governmental organizations worldwide have attempted to impose regulations on what scientists can and cannot do PERIOD In March of  less than a year after Dollys birth former President Bill Clinton banned the use of federal funding for humancloning projects in America PERIOD

More recently the United Nations Educational Science and Cultural Organization called for a worldwide ban on human cloning PERIOD Additionally the Food and Drug Administration has publicly insisted on strict enforcement of scientific experimentation on cloning PERIOD

The U.S PERIOD Congress is currently considering a cloning ban proposed by Rep PERIOD Bart Stupak DMich. and Rep PERIOD Dave Weldon RFla. which is essentially a reintroduction of a ban passed by the House of Representatives in  but never considered by the Senate PERIOD The bill retains its ban on all importation of cloned human embryos but no longer bans the importation of treatments discovered outside the United States that use humancloning techniques PERIOD

However if strict legislation passes the effects could be detrimental to the science and medical fields Charo warns PERIOD

Its the most effective way people have ever thought of to treat genetic disease said Charo who opposes the banning of cloning research due to its potential scientific and medical benefits PERIOD

UW oncology professor Waclaw Syzbalski who has conducted genetictherapy research shares Charos sentiments and opposes the crackdown on cloning citing its potential for repairing damaged or dysfunctional human body parts PERIOD

You can make tissue replacements  and actually replace existent cells with new ones Charo said PERIOD

Gene therapy



As cloning research further develops and becomes more useful in the world of science and medicine another type of cell manipulation is at its heels gene therapy PERIOD Discovered in the mid70s this cloninglike process involves inserting copies of genes into cells holding dysfunctional genes PERIOD The idea is to correct the medical problem at a very basic level DNA PERIOD

Gene therapy is to replace a faulty gene a small segment of DNA with a new gene. szybalski said PERIOD

Gene therapy falls into two distinct categories PERIOD The first somatic cell therapy alters an individuals genome but does not pass that change on to future generations PERIOD Germline therapy however enhances sperm and egg cells with the purpose of passing the change on to the next generation PERIOD

By adding this technology to cloning capabilities you could not only make an identical person but identical plus an improvement Szybalski said PERIOD

If this were to take place eugenics would become a possibility PERIOD Eugenics is defined as the study of hereditary improvement of the human race by controlled selective breeding. although this statement does cover the general purpose of the process it can be misleading PERIOD The term improvement at this point in science refers to fixing faulty genes and possibly curing fatal diseases not engineering humans with specific attributes PERIOD However this latter option is a fear many people have as this practice continues to advance in its capabilities PERIOD

Szybalski cautions society against assuming the worst PERIOD

Its all theoretical because it was never done in humans but practical because it was done in animals he said PERIOD

Even so todays genetherapy technologies are far from accomplishing such a task PERIOD

In principal its good but scientists need another  to  years to make it better. szybalski said PERIOD

Stem cells

While the science of reproductive cloning has received its share of attention the past few months stemcell research which has helped to further develop genetherapy techniques has been an ongoing debate pitting scientists against ethicists in the same way as the conflict surrounding cloning PERIOD

In  UW researchers led by Dr PERIOD James Thomson were able to completely isolate stem cells the precursor cells that hold the potential for developing into various types of cells PERIOD By  the scientists for the first time ever were able to create embryonic stem cells PERIOD Since then UW has set up a foundation to study them PERIOD

Creating replacement cells for mutated or damaged tissue has been a primary goal of medical experts researching stemcell technology PERIOD

Andrew Cohn spokesperson for WiCell Research Institution Inc. a group dedicated to the advancement of stemcell technology sees the medical prospects of developing stem cells as too beneficial to pass up PERIOD

Were still very early but we are working on creating heart cells nerve cells and pancreatic cells. cohn said PERIOD

Yet despite scientific claims to the potential benefits to human health further stemcell research might lead to many critics have raised red flags concerned about just what genetic toying might enable people to do in the future if it falls into the wrong hands PERIOD

Social and ethical problems



While there is still no hard evidence that scientists have ever created a fully cloned human mixed results from past attempts at human duplication have left some scientists lukewarm toward the idea of continuing research PERIOD In animals the success rate has remained low and the detrimental effects that afflict some of these clones scare off some researchers from trying to salvage research in progress PERIOD

Im against human cloning now for the simple reason that there are too many birth defects Szybalski said PERIOD

Other issues such as cloned individuals places in society and their own selfview come into question PERIOD If introduced into todays environment what is the clones role  a great medical experiment a scientific wonder or a man surpassing God and religion

Furthermore skeptics say if human cloning is achieved what would prevent people from engineering their children to have certain physical and biological attributes

Apart from all the curiosity surrounding clones purpose critics wonder if on the most basic level cloning is even ethical PERIOD

At this point research and experimentation are still being done so that scientists and society can understand the full effects of such technology PERIOD For now at least it seems like an Attack of the Clones is still lightyears away PERIOD
