One hundred and thirtythree years of editorial freedom

An old friend hides his stash in the top drawer of his bedroom dresser PERIOD Its a plastic bag bloated between balled socks and spare change PERIOD Ive never seen anything like it PERIOD

What he asks juggling the bag between his hands PERIOD

I shrug and shake my head with a smile PERIOD Nothing I say Its just weird I guess. he peels the bag open dumps its contents out onto the dresser PERIOD Ive got about four years worth right here PERIOD And I remember every single one  who I went with when we went PERIOD

Oh cmon PERIOD Youre telling me that you dont collect ticket stubs

 Huh PERIOD I guess not PERIOD

You could call me a collector Ive got binders of Pokmon cards stacks of Britney Spears albums and a short list of famous and fictional husbands PERIOD But movie ticket stubs You watch endure or snooze through a film  then its over PERIOD Whats the point of saving scraps of trash for sentimental value Thats not a collection its a symptom of hoarding  or so I thought PERIOD

Id never heard a film spoken about in the way that music lovers fawn over the classics or in the way that selfproclaimed book nerds leak enthusiasm and simultaneous dread every time a chapter reaches its end PERIOD Film has never fit itself into my nostalgic conversations  not in the way that I lay back in the passenger seat of my best friends car and marvel at the way a song sucks us back into certain moments with certain people in certain places PERIOD

We dont discuss films like familiar scents from childhood not like how a waft of lemon Pledge is my bandcamp cabin or how a spritz of Victorias Secret Love Spell is middleschool locker rooms PERIOD Id never thought film captured what songs could latch onto not like how All Time Lows Remembering Sunday is postgraduation bonfires ringed by boys with guitars and Skinny Love is morningstoafternoons buried in bedsheets PERIOD

So as fond as I am of the Olsen twins Passport to Paris it just doesnt take me back  in fact it doesnt take me anywhere and certainly not to Paris PERIOD A trip to the theater was just that a trip to the theater PERIOD Nothing more nothing less unless I conceded and sprung for another pack of Sour Patch Kids PERIOD Then it cost a little more PERIOD

As the pile of ticket stubs spilled across the dresser I channeled my inner Patron of the Arts PERIOD Plot twist She is unsurprisingly clich PERIOD Film just doesnt  speak to me I thought PERIOD Or maybe we were simply speaking two different languages PERIOD Had I grown deaf I wanted my deep emotional resonance and I wanted it now

It turns out that I just wasnt looking  or listening  hard enough PERIOD

Film fooled me PERIOD It presented itself as an isolated experience with no more residual significance than the buzz of background noise while music on the other ear offered the definitive soundtrack to my teenage years and rites of passage PERIOD I thought film was nothing special and certainly nothing to document and collect in my drawers PERIOD But after some digging through my DVD collection and my memory my socks and the lacy like I realized that  oh how the words pain me  I was wrong PERIOD

To this day I refuse to watch The Year Without a Santa Claus since the night when as the Heat Miser spit fire my 8yearold self spewed lessexciting substances all over the livingroom couch PERIOD Cringe PERIOD

The Temptations will forever remind or haunt to be more accurate me of my middleschool band room where at least once a month Mrs PERIOD Scott would pull the window blinds tight and tsk at every saxophone player whod made his music stand a headrest PERIOD

And Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is branded onto my psyche as that bittersweet movie that stimulates both my tear ducts and my gag reflex for very different reasons than Claus PERIOD These arent just movies anymore PERIOD Theyre a part of my identity PERIOD

Im still a collector Boxes of Seventeen Magazine have lined my familys garage shelves since  theyll be useful one day PERIOD And now faded ticket stubs dot the bulletin board above my desk pinned and jammed and stuck by magnets PERIOD Call me a hoarder of memories but hey maybe some things are worth saving PERIOD
