This is a developing story PERIOD The Breeze will continue to report on this story as it unfolds PERIOD

Two dozen Jewish faculty faculty emeriti and staff from JMU intend to boycott a Holocaustcentered lecture event planned for Jan PERIOD  the group said in a letter addressed to President Jonathan Alger in which they say the planning of the program disrespected and disparaged Jewish individuals dismissed Jewish participation and failed to reflect the inclusive values that JMU purports to foster. the letter included in full below was created to share the faculty members concerns perspectives feelings of isolation and to ask for action in response to their alienation according to the letter PERIOD Several sources sent the letter to The Breeze PERIOD

One Jewish member of the planning committee and two other Jewish people who were involved but not officially on the committee resigned following concerns about the planning process saying Jewish voices at JMU and in the community were casually diminished according to the letter PERIOD This was confirmed by several people familiar with the matter PERIOD

The event An Evening Conversation on the History and Legacy of the Holocaust is to be held Jan PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD in the Festival Ballroom PERIOD According to a copy of the event program sent to The Breeze the event is sponsored by JMUs Office of the Provost the Office for Inclusive Strategies and Equity Initiatives the Gandhi Center for Global Nonviolence and the Madison Center for Civic Engagement and the evening will feature two speakers Alan Berger from Florida Atlantic University and Phyllis Leffler a professor emerita from University of Virginia PERIOD Therell also be a musical performance featuring JMU Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Heather Coltman on piano PERIOD

Following the publication of this article Taimi Castle the director of the Gandhi Center emailed a written statement to The Breeze expressing the Gandhi Centers support for the boycott PERIOD Castle said the Gandhi Center representative left the planning committee in October and has not been involved with the planning of the event PERIOD At that time Castle said their understanding was that concerns about the lack of Jewish representation in the planning was being addressed by other offices PERIOD

She added that the Gandhi Center contributed  to the event but wouldve pulled its financial support had it been made aware of the ongoing concerns PERIOD

The letter also takes issue with the tone and language of the event PERIOD A local rabbi who wasnt involved with the writing of the letter Jeffrey KurtzLendner said the program for the event felt insensitive because it felt more like a celebration than a commemoration PERIOD If JMU had made adequate preparations the letter reads the university would have marked the somberness of the occasion. the letter also alleges that JMU ignored members of the community who pushed for more consultation and reliance on experts uninvited those who sought change and didnt acknowledge concerns raised by Jewish faculty behind closed doors for years. had JMU been willing to recognize that inclusive strategies conceived in isolation cannot be universally applied the letter states JMU would have understood the difference between being difficult and being informed judicious and willing to stand up to make JMU the best University it can be. sic

The Breeze reached out to MaryHope Vass executive director of communications and JMU spokesperson for comment on this story PERIOD Malika CarterHoyt vice president of diversity equity and inclusion and the universitys chief diversity officer responded to the letter in a written statement PERIOD

The statement on behalf of JMU acknowledges the concerns expressed in the letter PERIOD CarterHoyt said neither she nor the Presidents Office were notified of these concerns before the receipt of the letter PERIOD She said shes reached out to a spokesperson for the group of faculty and staff to schedule a meeting and learn more about the situation PERIOD CarterHoyts full response is available on The Breezes website PERIOD

While there is disagreement it is important to note that a committee was formed through the recommendations of college deans as this was an academic event hosted by Academic Affairs CarterHoyt said PERIOD Committee members were selected based on substantive expertise and commitment to the creation of an event that properly marks the occasion no one was included or excluded explicitly based on a particular protected characteristic. malika CarterHoyt VP of diversity equity and inclusion and chief diversity officer responded to the faculty letter about the Jan PERIOD  Holocaust event with a written statement provided to The Breeze PERIOD Heres the statement in full PERIOD

Following publication of this article The Breeze reached out to all four offices listed as sponsors of the event for a followup story PERIOD Vass responded saying  Vass told The Breeze to direct questions and followups to her PERIOD

Maura Hametz the history department head at JMU said shes part of the group that wrote the letter PERIOD She served on the planning committee for last years inaugural Holocaust Remembrance event and remembers her time on the committee as a wonderful experience working with other faculty members to choose last years speaker PERIOD

A year later shes boycotting the event PERIOD

This year Ive had several people say to me Oh Im gonna go to the thing on Thursday PERIOD See you there and my answer of course is Thank you you know Im not attending Hametz said PERIOD

The letter states these issues concerning the Jewish community are especially pertinent concerning rising antisemitism and cites a Dec PERIOD  statementfrom Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares noting that antisemitism is rising on college and university campuses across the country including a rise in AntiIsrael incidents on college campuses PERIOD

Some members of the Jewish community in Harrisonburg also took issue with the event PERIOD

In a Jan PERIOD  email shared with The Breezeto members of the Beth El congregation in Harrisonburg congregation leaders wrote of the event that normally wed help spread the word PERIOD However in this instance we CANNOT in good faith promote the event. kurtzLendner a leader of the Beth El congregation said the Jewish community continues to feel repercussions from the Holocaust and the program for the event felt insensitive because it felt more like a celebration than a commemoration PERIOD While KurtzLendner said he doesnt know the thought process behind the event members of the Beth El congregation feel slighted PERIOD

Many of us are children of survivors or grandchildren of survivors grandchildren of people who did not survive and we grew up with the reality of that trauma in our households so this is not a historical event for us KurtzLendner said PERIOD We kind of live this. moving forward KurtzLendner said hed like to see JMU put on events that could be a model for others. youd want it to be reflective and represent inclusivity KurtzLendner said PERIOD It feels like its opportunistic rather than inclusive. one of the Jewish faculty members who volunteered for the planning committee after outreach from university leadership requested to speak anonymously because they were worried about repercussions for speaking out PERIOD The faculty member who said they later resigned from the planning committee said with the limited timeframe they felt decisions were made pretty rapidly there was limited time for discussion and there was a lack of expertise concerning the Holocaust PERIOD

The faculty member said after they resigned they were contacted individually about their concerns rather than being treated as a member of a community PERIOD

When were already feeling isolated on campus  it takes a lot of courage for us to speak out they said PERIOD I didnt want to meet as an individual because its not about me its not about assuaging my personal concerns  were part of a community. the faculty member was one of the three Jewish committee members to resign according to several people who spoke to The Breeze PERIOD I thought I was filling out a gap or adding representation not being it they said PERIOD

Hametz did say shes encouraged by peoples response to the letter PERIOD After hearing about the situation JMU community members have reached out to express concern and apologize Hametz said even when they havent been involved in it PERIOD

Its profoundly disappointing that the way that this has come about but its also hopeful to me that so many people are coming together and saying No we have to do better in the future Hametz said PERIOD It tells me that theres a core at JMU of people who really who are getting it and who want  to not have something like this happen again PERIOD And so in a weird way it makes me a little hopeful. shirin Zia Faqiri contributed to this report PERIOD

CORRECTION Jan PERIOD   p.m PERIOD  A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the three Jewish members of the planning committee resigned PERIOD The article has been updated to reflect that one official member of the planning committee resigned alongside two other Jewish faculty members who were involved but not actually on the committee PERIOD
