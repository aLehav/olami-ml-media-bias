A few clouds PERIOD Low 41F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Franklin Delano Roosevelt once described Dec PERIOD  as a day that will live in infamy PERIOD

In Ohio its the day that another element of personal freedom breathed its dying breath PERIOD

The Smoke Free Ohio Act now Chapter  of the Ohio Revised Code became law on Dec PERIOD   marking the last day that business owners had the choice whether or not to permit smoking in their businesses PERIOD However because of the inability of the state government to enforce the law some businesses are still allowing smoking without fear of repercussions PERIOD

The law has literally left thousands of smokers in Cincinnati out in the cold PERIOD Where there were once businesses that provided smoking lounges for their tobaccoaddicted employees there are now smokers standing on medians outside of their places of employment shivering as they get their fix PERIOD In Cincinnati bars there are now plenty of open seats once filled by smoking regulars PERIOD In places like Havana Martini a downtown cigar bar people can still buy their cigars along with their cosmopolitans  they just cant enjoy them together anymore PERIOD

Smoking and drinking have always gone together like peanut butter and jelly PERIOD

Proponents of the law claim that the law is a good thing for Ohio and they point to other states like California Massachusetts and Delaware as paragons of health virtue PERIOD They claim that the economic impact of the law hasnt been an issue PERIOD

But Los Angeles doesnt have a Newport right across the bridge PERIOD

Cincinnati has been on the losing end of an economic battle with the cities of Northern Kentucky for years now and the addition of the smoking ban is not going to attract business from across the bridge PERIOD Its sending it over to the other side PERIOD

Despite that there are those that believe the health benefits are important at any cost PERIOD Diane Bellbrook is a believer PERIOD Bellbrook is a cancer survivor who blames her work in restaurants and exposure to secondhand smoke for her illness PERIOD You can find her story at httpwww.smokefreeohio.org the official Web site of the SmokeFreeOhio movement PERIOD

The employees who work in these places dont have a say Bellbrooks writes on the site PERIOD Nobody has protected them PERIOD Its a moral obligation to protect the lives of those who are working in environments where there is secondhand smoke PERIOD

While Bellbrook is a sympathetic character what shes missing is the fact that the employees absolutely have a say PERIOD Last I checked slavery is illegal in these United States and by God people have a right to choose where they work PERIOD

In times past it may have been true to say that employees of businesses that were exposed to secondhand smoke were not protected from the dangers PERIOD Nobody told them it was dangerous PERIOD Nobody told them it was a threat to their health PERIOD

Today though its hard to turn on a television without seeing a commercial from organizations like Truth.com that describe and decry the dangers of secondhand smoke PERIOD If there are still people out there who dont know about secondhand smoke there are still people residing underneath large boulders PERIOD

The fact is the law is yet another example of the government legislating an issue that should be a choice PERIOD The choice whether to support a business that looks out for the health of its customers and employees PERIOD The choice to work in a place where there might be hazards PERIOD The choice to market a business to one clientele over another PERIOD

But Ohioans voted to choke the life out of choice PERIOD And now Cincinnati can look forward to seeing even more of its business go up in smoke PERIOD
