Career Services is bogged down with appointments earlier than usual this year PERIOD Even as snow continues to fall on Tappan Square Oberlin students are trying to secure their summer plans which in many cases means an unpaid internship PERIOD Recently however that goto answer for What are you doing after May has started to be contested in courtrooms and commentary pages across the country PERIOD

At the beginning of February an Ohio State University alumna who served as an intern for over a year at Harpers Bazaar filed a lawsuit accusing the Hearst Corporation of exploiting her fulltime work doing various administrative tasks for the fashion magazine PERIOD Last year two interns who had worked on the production of Fox Searchlights Black Swan one of whom had recently graduated from Wesleyan University began organizing a classaction lawsuit against the company they say violated the Department of Labors guidelines for employers offering unpaid internships PERIOD

The DOL issued the guidelines in April  clarifying the distinction between educational internships versus trainee or entrylevel employment which must be compensated under minimumwage and overtime laws PERIOD According to the agency a genuine internship experience is for the benefit of the intern and the company offering the opportunity derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern. arts and media companies have become especially dependent on the model to keep costs low benefiting from the widespread perception that menial thankless moneylosing work is just something newcomers have to suck up if they want to break into a desirable career PERIOD

Oberlin Colleges policy on internships sends mixed messages PERIOD Career Services stipulates that students can only receive one credit for internships in which students work a minimum of  hours PERIOD We would point out that interning involves significantly more time and energy than students spend on an ExCos or athletics class PERIOD While internships done over Winter Term count as projects students are required to pay a  fee to have summer experience approved for credit by the College and must also have their supervisors submit two performance evaluations PERIOD While it makes sense that Oberlin wants to know students work has legitimate educational value the policy still puts students at the whim of a system telling them they ought to go out of their way to do real work for no money paying out of personal or parental pocket to make it count for something PERIOD

Youth unemployment in the U.S PERIOD hovers around  percent a number that draws a mix of reactions PERIOD One is outrage that companies are getting away with reclassifying as interns the people doing work that a decade or two ago would have earned them entrylevel pay PERIOD Another is to shrug and say With my chances at getting a paying job that bad I might as well get used to the idea of moving back in with my parents and try to at least gain a little experience. will college students collectively decide to stop grinning and bearing what aNew York Timesblogger recently called the 21stcentury equivalent of underpaid child labor in early 1900s coal mines Will lawsuit results make unpaid internships a thing of the past Either way in a time when a bachelors degree is now basically a prerequisite to be considered for most kinds of work and graduate school is quickly losing the edge it gives its attendees in the job market the situation points to young adults spending longer and longer learning how to be good job candidates instead of good employees PERIOD Unless employers and the people formerly known as employees can forge a more sustainable and accessible path toward paid professional labor we might as well give up on this notion of meritocracy and admit that the ability to spend the opening years of our adult lives with no paycheck is a necessary ingredient for success PERIOD
