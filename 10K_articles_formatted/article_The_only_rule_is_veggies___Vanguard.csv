Another good website is allrecipes.com great for when you have random ingredients and no idea what to make PERIOD Their search engine allows you to plug in the food you have exclude the food you dont and get hundreds of different recipes PERIOD I recommend reading the reviews PERIOD The recipes as written often need work reviewers who have tried the recipes provide feedback on which you can base your own meal PERIOD
