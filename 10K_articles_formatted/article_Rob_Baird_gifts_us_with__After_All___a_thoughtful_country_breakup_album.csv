Country has a distinct sensibility one capable of evoking specific landscapes and brands of sorrow joy and attraction PERIOD In After All Rob Baird directs this sensibility toward the emotional journey of a breakup PERIOD He follows the classic trajectory of other breakup albums of this ilk tracing the stages from denial to despair to anger and betrayal to eventual resolve and acceptance PERIOD Its a familiar path so its saying something for Baird that After All still sounds completely fresh original and genuinely heartfelt PERIOD

A notable component of the albums effectiveness is Bairds skill as a lyricist which is evident from the very beginning of the album PERIOD On the opening title track Baird sings about the feeling that a relationship isnt going to work out PERIOD He illustrates a sense of directionlessness and waning hope with lines about All these long nights all these street lights  Bleeding into the fog. this surehanded poeticism keeps up throughout the album from contemplative songs like I Tried Everywhere I go its pouring rain  Shouldnt have to hold on to try to stay sane to despairing tracks like Burning Blue Like the desert rain  Sunday silence  And the choices Ive made and the eventual resolution of Best That I Was Silver lake skies  Make no reason why PERIOD

After All brims with unbridled emotion from the guitarriddled electric streetlamp alertness of Losing Hands and Aint Going Back to You to the hurt mingled with resignation in Devil Woman Blues. each song feels like its own pocket of a story totaling a whole that looks like a dreamfueled road trip around America PERIOD The effect of the songs is that of driving past familiar scenery and feeling like something about your relationship with it is shifting before your eyes PERIOD This changing vision is the crux of After All exemplified in songs like Give Me Back My Love which lands somewhere between a plea from the former lover and a desperate longing for a sense of love in general PERIOD When Baird sings Gonna pick me up some silver lining  Gonna turn these nickels into dimes and later Give me back my love one cant help but relate to the notion of love itself as ones own happiness and contentedness whatever this might demand from another person PERIOD

A large part of what makes After All a skillful album is the way in which Baird uses raw emotion as a starting point rather than imagery or classic lyrical traditions PERIOD Country music  which when measured by its masters is truly a vast collection of variety creativity and heart  is so often superficially pigeonholed as a genre defined by dusty roads dimly lit bars and pickup trucks PERIOD Specific images and phrases in other words that are all too easy to toss into a song under the thinly veiled guise of thoughtful songwriting PERIOD

But there is very little of this affectation in After All as Baird sets himself apart from some of these pitfalls using a masterful command of poetic devices as he himself defines them PERIOD He still orients his stories  because again that is what each of the songs on After All is a unified emotional little story within itself  around traveling open roads and wandering empty streets PERIOD One gets the sense that this journey for which he has invited us along is only one of many hell take each of which has its own kind of wisdom to impart PERIOD Amid these familiar landscapes Baird writes from his experiences first unconcerned with figures outside of the unique relationship he is personally navigating wandering those empty streets as only he can PERIOD
