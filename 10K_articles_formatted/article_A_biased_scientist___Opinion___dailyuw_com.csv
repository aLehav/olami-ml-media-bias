Science is supposed to be objective PERIOD This is how it works and the right discoveries are made PERIOD If science were subjective we would still believe that the Earth was flat and at the center of the universe PERIOD

Researchers embrace this idea PERIOD In the scientific community manipulating data and falsifying findings is a heinous act PERIOD Those who commit such crimes are practically excommunicated by their colleagues PERIOD The purpose of science is to find the truth not the desired result PERIOD

Beyond the scientific community this impartialness has not always been appreciated PERIOD Take a look at the commercials you see on TV PERIOD How often have you heard something to supposedly be supported by scientific findings There is a plethora of herbal remedies diet pills and emotional boosters that fall into this category PERIOD Although these products may not be lying it is unlikely they are telling the whole truth PERIOD If a diet pill could be found that would cure obesity dont you think that every doctor in the United States would be prescribing it Obviously there is more to the pills than meets the eye PERIOD

Fortunately for Americans our leaders have adopted this impartial perspective PERIOD The U.S PERIOD government pays billions of dollars in support of scientific research PERIOD The leaders in Congress and the White House have consistently viewed science as a useful tool for advancing society PERIOD Unbiased scientific evidence is crucial for policymaking decisions PERIOD Or least this is the idea PERIOD

To be honest science isnt the end all say all piece of evidence used in most decisions PERIOD And this can be a good thing PERIOD With peoples livelihood at stake sometimes the best scientific recommendations need to be compromised PERIOD However blatant ignorance of scientific reports and the latest finding can be detrimental PERIOD

For the most part over the past century the presidents of the United States have accepted science when making decisions PERIOD There have been points where the scientific community grumbled but no open conflict has arisen PERIOD In this election year things have decidedly changed PERIOD

President Bush has lost the support of a large portion of the scientific community PERIOD His policies have blatantly disregarded several key scientific findings over the past four years PERIOD Fortysix Nobel Laureates have adamantly thrown their support behind Sen PERIOD John Kerry in an act of protest PERIOD

This loss of support is wellfounded PERIOD Bush has failed to take any action to counteract global warming PERIOD Bush envisions a society where the nation uses hydrogen as a new source of clean fuel PERIOD This is a great longterm goal but it does not address the issue in the here and now PERIOD With growing evidence that the longer we wait the worse the climatic problem will become action is needed PERIOD Furthermore his decision to put a moratorium on federal funding for new stem cell research has stifled a promising new field PERIOD Researchers are leaving the U.S PERIOD for other nations where scientific progress is being embraced PERIOD

Tomorrow the nation will decide what action to take in its future PERIOD As a scientist I encourage you to support Kerry PERIOD We as both a nation and as a species cannot wait another four years for change to occur PERIOD
