The recent reporting on the preparations for the  Census has revealed  like almost every aspect of the Trump administration  a terrifying though unsurprising devotion to upholding structural racism PERIOD The reinstatement of the question about citizenship included in the U.S PERIOD Census Bureaus released final questions does not even attempt to hide antiimmigrant intentions PERIOD

Providing extensive identifying information and an indication of citizenship status to a blatantly xenophobic federal government is dangerous for some members of immigrant communities PERIOD Out of a justified fear of deportation or detention many will not fill out the census and the national immigrant population will be underreported by the survey depriving people of resources and aid PERIOD

The defense offered by Department of Commerce officials is that the question will protect minority voters PERIOD This is a baseless claim given that this question was last included in the census  years before the Voting Rights Act existed PERIOD This intimidation tactic is meant to reduce immigrant responses and erase the existence of millions of people in this country PERIOD

However the citizenship question is only one of many red flags in the lead up to a disastrous census PERIOD Institutional incompetence and a drive to perpetuate white supremacy plagued the preparations for the national count before this particularly nefarious incident PERIOD When the quality of life political power and quantifiable existence of communities is on the line the U.S PERIOD Census Bureaus continuous malpractice is something to be aware of and incredibly concerned about PERIOD

Problems begin with the fact that the Bureau remains underfunded which jeopardizes an exhaustive count being possible PERIOD If the hundreds of thousands of census workers who need to get household responses cannot be hired accuracy is in peril off the bat PERIOD Though Congress recently increased the Bureaus funding last month it is hardly enough to fix the understaffing problems which can only be solved through massive continuous budget increases PERIOD

An accurate count is also made less likely by Census Bureaus stalling on the rollout of the first digitized census PERIOD Though meant to increase responses online counting will severely limit accurate statistics on rural and impoverished communities PERIOD If communities cannot easily access an online questionnaire and if the Bureau already cannot employ enough workers to manually count rural communities the areas will be misrepresented and remain underserved PERIOD

The federal governments monumental cybersecurity failures will also turn many away from responding PERIOD Fearing both external hacks and the misuse of data by the federal government itself the public has had little assurance when it comes to the Trump administration handling personal information and little is being done to rebuild this trust before the census PERIOD

The nightmare of conducting the census has been previewed in the documented mismanagement of the Bureaus only trial run in Providence County Rhode Island PERIOD With a nearly nonexistent advertising budget county residents experienced mass confusion and didnt know the test was coming PERIOD Even before the citizenship question was added residents of cities with large immigrant populations such as Central Falls had already expressed reservations about completing a government questionnaire PERIOD

The racial classifications on the  Census have also been designed to provide incomplete and misleading U.S PERIOD demographics PERIOD For years there had been mounting public and internal pressure to reform the surveys racial categories to include Middle Eastern or North African MENA mixed race and Hispanic which is currently an ethnicity within racial categories options PERIOD Adding these designations would more accurately account for present and rapidly growing U.S PERIOD demographics better capturing the nations true diversity and embolden advocacy efforts for these targeted groups PERIOD

The Department of Commerce announced in January that there will not be a MENA category on the  Census PERIOD The administrations travel bans targeting Middle Eastern and North African countries make the malicious intent obvious the erasure of millions of MENA Americans a growing segment of the U.S PERIOD population whose specific interests must be addressed PERIOD It denies those targeted and surveilled by the national security apparatus the basic right to selfidentify perpetuating their status as foreigners who dont belong PERIOD To have no MENA category is to signal that these Americans do not matter that they should only be counted in monitoring security threats PERIOD

Omitting a MENA category from the census is also a method of reinforcing white supremacy PERIOD The Bureaus research showed that including additional racial categories drastically decreased the number of whiteidentifying respondents on the census which has been artificially inflated for decades PERIOD Refusing to add the category helps keep America statistically more white and minimizes the presence and perceived political importance of people of color PERIOD

The census has incredible implications for the entire population that make these issues terrifying PERIOD Census results are most notably used to draw local state and congressional legislative districts as well as determine the number of seats each state gets in the House of Representatives PERIOD

Equally important though is that census results are used to allocate federal spending for education healthcare and transportation PERIOD At least  billion are allocated annually based on census data and this includes money for Medicaid Medicare Section  housing Title I Educational Grants and other crucial programs PERIOD

State power is reinforced and repositioned through the census results PERIOD Resources are distributed and representation is given based on these statistics PERIOD The results additionally signal to the nations lawmakers who matters and who does not when it comes to major policy decisions PERIOD

Those counted by the census are recognized as present in this country PERIOD

Attempts can be made to mitigate the damage of the  Census PERIOD Encouraging representatives to support continued federal budget increases is a start to improving turnout though this doesnt address the antiimmigrant question of the racial categorizations themselves PERIOD Removing the citizenship question is currently being fought for in a recent lawsuit filed by  states seven cities and the U.S PERIOD Conference of Mayors along the grounds that it violates the Constitution and the Bureaus mandate to count the entire U.S PERIOD population PERIOD

Although launched by a strong bipartisan coalition there is still the possibility that the suit will fail in court though given that the Census Bureau isnt technically blocking people from being counted but rather disincentivizing and intimidating them so that they decide not to PERIOD The standing of the suit will come down to the interpretation of malicious intent by a federal court PERIOD

Under the Trump administration the census will attempt to ensure the existing power structure PERIOD The data will undercount poor urban immigrant and minority populations perpetuating the institutional disenfranchisement of already underserved communities PERIOD

Instead the  Census will overrepresent affluent suburban areas with smaller immigrant populations PERIOD It will subsequently concentrate economic and political resources into majority white Republican districts which will be capable of winning elections for years to come in spite of the countrys rapidly changing demographics PERIOD
