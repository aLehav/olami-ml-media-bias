UNL students and other eligible borrowers have begun applying for President Joe Bidens student loan forgiveness program but the plan could be in trouble after being temporarily blocked by a federal appeals court on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

Six states including Nebraska filed a lawsuit against the program that said erasing student loan debt could harm loan companies that manage federal loans themselves PERIOD The initial suit was dismissed in court but the states filed an appeal and requested the program be put on a temporary hold while the case is under review PERIOD

While no loan forgiveness can be given at this time the application remains open PERIOD

The decision could be especially important for University of NebraskaLincoln students whose typical loan debt is just over the offered forgiveness of  according to UNL Director of Scholarships and Financial Aid Justin Chase Brown PERIOD If the decision is not blocked an average UNL students final bill could be knocked down to the cost of a year of tuition at a Nebraska community college he said PERIOD

Despite the setback White House Press Secretary Karine JeanPierre encouraged eligible borrowers to join the almost  million Americans who have already applied PERIOD

The application process offered through the Office of Federal Student Aid requires only basic information like an applicants name phone number and social security number PERIOD The whole process could be completed in five minutes offering up to  in debt forgiveness PERIOD

It is also important to note that the order does not reverse the trial courts dismissal of the case or suggest that the case has merit JeanPierre said in her statement PERIOD It merely prevents debt from being discharged until the court makes a decision. with the status of Bidens program in limbo Brown pointed to another federal aid program Public Service Loan Forgiveness PERIOD The program offers loan forgiveness to former borrowers in exchange for working jobs such as teachers firefighters firstresponders nurses military members nonprofits and other public service professions PERIOD

The US Department of Education announced Tuesday that the PSLF program would see revisions to allow more Americans to take advantage of its perks including expanding qualifications and giving more flexibility with payments PERIOD

Despite the looming uncertainty over the status of repayment Brown encouraged students to take advantage of the opportunities loans provide PERIOD

I would want students to make their own decisions and not necessarily be scared of loans said Brown PERIOD Loans are an opportunity PERIOD Theyre an opportunity to basically borrow against your own success. newsdailynebraskan.com
