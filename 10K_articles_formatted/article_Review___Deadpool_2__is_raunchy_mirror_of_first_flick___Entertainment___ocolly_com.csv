 a comedic superhero movie stars Ryan Reynolds PERIOD

Deadpool Ryan Reynolds is back and more sarcastic than ever PERIOD Deadpool  which David Leitch directed delivers the familiar raunchy comedy the first movie offers PERIOD

When things take a turn for the worse Wade sets out as Deadpool to find and kill his adversaries PERIOD Wade quickly learns that the more people he goes through to get to his target the more people he encounters that he needs to protect PERIOD

Along his journey Wade finds his way back to the XMansion because Colossus voice of Stefan Kapicic drags him there PERIOD There his friends encourage him to continue the work the XMen started and he is given a mission PERIOD

Writers break the fourth wall to explain holes in the plot or provide additional comedy PERIOD They even use it at times to make fun of themselves PERIOD

Fan favorites who reappear in the sequel include Blind Al Leslie Uggams and taxi driver Dopinder Karan Soni PERIOD

Blind Al adds to the comedy with her constant acceptance of Deadpool and the antics she cant see PERIOD

Dopinders heroworship of Deadpool also adds a comical note when he serves as Deadpools getaway driver PERIOD Dopinder has no herolike abilities but wishes to become exactly like Deadpool PERIOD

Deadpool  borrows themes from multiple movies with the child destined to become evil and the Terminatortype time hopper PERIOD

The graphics switch between realistic and silly PERIOD There are times when Deadpool dies and his death is overly graphic and other times when he dies and his death is barely notable PERIOD Either way both are usually comical and the use of multiple graphics keeps it interesting PERIOD

The audience should stick around for the credits PERIOD They offer hilarious cartoon depictions of the cast and address Reynolds role as Green Lantern and Deadpool in the XMen Origins Wolverine PERIOD
