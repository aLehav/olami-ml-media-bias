Initiative  penned by David Goldstein would require antitax crusader Tim Eyman be labeled a  Tomorrow this piece of satirical significance will be debated in a Seattle courtroom PERIOD

While definitely an absurd piece of legislation Goldsteins initiative has some merit as a lighthearted jab at the initiative process PERIOD By crafting I831 Goldstein not only made a mockery out of Eyman but of the initiative process itself PERIOD

The initiative process is unnecessary and ineffective PERIOD While it provides an opportunity for a higher level of public involvement in government those who draft and sign the initiatives are not familiar with the complexities and legalities of the lawmaking process PERIOD This takes money directly out of taxpayers pockets when these same initiatives are defended in court by the state attorneys office PERIOD

More effective and direct ways for involvement in government exist other than the initiative process PERIOD Washington states initiative process should be abolished PERIOD If citizens want to be more active in this states government an action far more powerful and effective than the initiative process exists  its called voting PERIOD
