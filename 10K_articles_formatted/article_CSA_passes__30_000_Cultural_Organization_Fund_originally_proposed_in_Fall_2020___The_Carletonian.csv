9035,2023-11-04,"this past summer in the wake of George Floyds murder a Carleton alumnus anonymously posted on the dearpwi Dear Predominantly White Institutions Instagram page about how the Carleton Student Association CSA continually underfunded Black Indigenous and People of Color BIPOC student organizations and multicultural events PERIOD

Specifically the post cited how the CSA did not fund a trip led by the Office of International and Intercultural Life OIIL to visit Civil Rights monuments while in the same meeting they did approve funding for a leadership trip planned by the majority white mens ultimate frisbee team PERIOD

This post led members of the CSA Budget Committee to propose creating a  Cultural Fund Group to support communitybuilding and events for studentled cultural organizations PERIOD

We want to ensure that we are providing the necessary funds for cultural organizations to build community said CSA President Andrew Farias  PERIOD

CSA VicePresident and Budget Committee Chair Brittany Dominguez  led the project which initially proposed to reallocate funds from Spring Concert which usually costs around  to the Cultural Organization Fund PERIOD While OIIL does provide funds for cultural organizations Dominquez explained that the CSA Cultural Organization Fund would work to supplement funds provided by OIIL and expand available funding PERIOD

CSA could have implemented this new fund without input from the student body however Dominguez explained that she really wanted to hear student voices and opinions about the matter. therefore in the fall of  the proposal to create a new Cultural Organization Fund using money from Spring Concert was put to a student body vote PERIOD

The proposal posited bringing a headliner to Spring Concert only every fourth year and featuring only local bands in the remaining yearswith the savings used to create the Cultural Organization Fund PERIOD

Only  of students participated in the vote and the proposal ultimately failed to meet the twothirds majority necessary to pass obtaining a close  approval PERIOD

Just because the initial motion failed didnt mean we wanted to abandon the notion as a whole said Farias PERIOD Therefore Dominquez and others worked to reimagine how a Cultural Organization Fund could be adopted into the CSAs Budget PERIOD

At the start of the new financial cycle in June Dominguez and other members of the Budget Committee were able to put together a savings plan to create the Cultural Organization Fund with  and reserve money to add to the fund in coming years PERIOD Dominguez explained that the money allocated was mainly incurred from savings that went back to CSA due to decreases in spending both this year and last year during the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD

For example savings were incurred from the cancellation of Spring Concert last year and from a lower rate of spending on CSA activities PERIOD Dominquez estimated that in total CSA has saved around  PERIOD These savings not only allow for the creation of the Cultural Organization Fund but also make it possible for CSA to lower the activities fee donate more money for causes such as the Carleton Cupboard and Winter Wardrobe and make up for lost funds due to the elimination of laundry fees in  PERIOD

Dominquez said that each year CSA can spend up to  of the fund and every year during Spring Allocations the Budget Committee will add enough money to the fund to bring it back up to at least  PERIOD

The Cultural Organization Fund will open up possibilities to provide new types of funding to cultural organizations that Budget Committee previously did not offer PERIOD For example the Budget Committee does not fund personal items such as Tshirts and only funds food for events that are open to the entire campus PERIOD

Farias said the Cultural Organization Fund will make an exception for cultural organizations in order to help them find healing build solidarity and build community. this term organizations such as LASO Latin American Student Organization and MOSAIC Mosaic of South Asian Interests at Carleton have already used the fund for care pancakes and to finance Tshirts for organization members who could not afford them PERIOD

In order to make sure the Cultural Organization Fund had a degree of permanence the CSA proposed including the fund within their Constitution PERIOD Farias explained that including financial stipulations in the Constitution has never been done before however Farias and CSA felt it was necessary in order to make sure that future funding to cultural organizations would not get cut during periods of financial strain PERIOD

In order to add the Cultural Organization Fund to the Constitution a referendum was included in the CSA Election poll sent out on February  PERIOD The referendum read Do you support the addition of a CSA Bylaw that stipulates that the CSA Budget Committee must allocate money to ensure the Cultural Organization Fund is filled up to at least  each year

With around  of the student population participating in the vote the referendum passed with  of voters in favor well above the needed twothirds majority PERIOD

Im pretty happy that it ended up passing said Dominquez who has worked on this project for several months now PERIOD Farias is also glad to see the fund accepted by the student body PERIOD Im excited that the CSA Cultural Organization Fund is really coming to fruition he said PERIOD

He added Its incredibly important that we support a Cultural Organization Fund when they need it the most. correction Feb PERIOD    this article has been updated from the version that appeared in our Feb PERIOD  print edition to include more specifics on the original proposal to reallocate Spring Concert funds PERIOD
