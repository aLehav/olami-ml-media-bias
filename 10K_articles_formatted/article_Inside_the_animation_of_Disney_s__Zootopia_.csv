Zootopia is a movie about an animal metropolis where animals ranging from predator to prey live together and thrive PERIOD The main character Judy Hopps is the first rabbit to join the metropolis police force but is assigned to parking duty PERIOD Eager to make more of an impact in the force Hopps jumps at the opportunity to crack a case even if it means partnering up with Nick Wilde a sly fox PERIOD

Kira Lehtomaki the animation supervisor for the film has been working with Walt Disney Animation Studios since  and has worked on films such as Bolt Tangled WreckIt Ralph as well as Oscar winners Paperman and Frozen. this is the first movie Lehtomaki has been an animation supervisor on since joining Disney PERIOD In this roleLehtomaki was able to animate a little bit but her main tasks were getting Judy Hopps ready for other animators to animate and making sure that Hopps performance was consistent throughout the movie PERIOD

Zootopia had a team of  animators and most of them worked on Hopps PERIOD

I have to make sure that it doesnt look like its  disjointed performances on this character Lehtomaki said PERIOD She has to feel consistent and that shes the same character in every scene. lehtomaki originally began her career as an animator working on previous Disney movies PERIOD As ananimator for a movie you are assigned a scene and a direction from your supervisor and you work with any supervisors in charge of the characters in the scene PERIOD

Now that Lehtomaki has moved up the ladder as an animation supervisor she was able to start work on the movie about a year before the rest of the animating team did.She workedwith a character designer a computer model creator a groom and a creator for the skeleton of the character PERIOD

A groom is in charge of the fur on the character and the creation of the skeleton allows the animators to move the puppet around inside the computer PERIOD

All those people create the character team and they work together for almost a year to get characters Judy Hopps in this case ready for animation PERIOD

Once the animators rolled in Lehtomaki had to make sure her ideas were consistent with the directors PERIOD

Lehtomaki provided acting examples for the directors to give them insight into the different personality traits of Judy Hopps so that the character Lehtomaki had worked to create would manifest accurately PERIOD Shewanted to make the directors feel like Judy Hopps was a living breathing character that wasnt worked onby  different people and to make it seem like Judy Hopps was a cohesive entity PERIOD

To achieve this cohesiveness researchershad to study various types of animals in person to capture certain traits PERIOD Ateam of  people went on a trip to Africa to study animals PERIOD Even though Lehtomaki wasnt a part of that team she was still able to tag along on other research trips including to local animal shelters PERIOD

Lehtomaki primarily studied rabbits and enjoyed picking out the qualities of the rabbits that could be incorporated into an anthropomorphic version PERIOD

Theyre not hopping around on all fours Lehtomaki said PERIOD We have to have them walking and talking. ear and nose movements and posture were vital to Judy Hopps because they gave her less of a human posture and more of an animal one PERIOD

The animation team wanted to make Zootopia different from other talking animal movies by depicting a world in whichanimals had evolved to walk on two feet and to emphasize that theyre not just humans in animal costumes PERIOD

Lehtomaki said that the story of Zootopia came about when the research team discovered that only ten percent of animals are predators in the wild and the rest are prey PERIOD

Predators may feel underrepresented in their worldview Lehtomaki said PERIOD Prey animals like Hopps might have a hard time standing out from the crowd. lehtomaki said that Hopps character resonated with her on a personal level PERIOD Judy Hopps had big dreams and everyone constantly told her that she wasnt going to make it as a cop because shes just a dumb bunny but she persevered and held onto her big dreams PERIOD

In the end she sees the world in both Nicks eyes and her own eyes Lehtomaki said PERIOD And shes still able to hold onto her dreams and be resilient. zootopia opened in theaters everywhere March  PERIOD
