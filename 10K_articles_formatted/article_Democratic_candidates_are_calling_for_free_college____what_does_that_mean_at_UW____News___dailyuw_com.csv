. trillion dollars PERIOD

To most a trillion is a number that is difficult to comprehend as anything other than simply a lot. as students or faculty at the UW we are all probably familiar with this figure by now PERIOD . trillion represents the national student loan debt and its the highest it has ever been PERIOD

This debt crisis has catapulted the conversation about free college into living rooms and coffee shops around the country PERIOD In  UW President Ana Mari Cauce defended the price of higher education and highlighted the UWs financial aid programs PERIOD

Talk about free college it already exists Cauce said PERIOD

President Cauce made this statement in reference to a program called the Husky Promise started in  PERIOD The program guarantees full coverage of tuition for qualifying students PERIOD If federal and state grants dont cover the full cost of tuition the Husky Promise pulls together institutional grants and scholarships to bridge the gap PERIOD Because these are not loans none of them need to be paid back PERIOD The Husky Promise covers around  students at all three campuses PERIOD

However this program only covers tuition costs and only applies to Washington state residents PERIOD For the  school year tuition costs were  in state PERIOD The total costs including tuition fees and living expenses was  according to the National Center for Educational Statistics for an instate student living on campus at the UW PERIOD For out of state this was  PERIOD

Despite the Husky Promise students still have enormous costs to cover after tuition PERIOD

A recent study by LendEDU shows that the average student debt per borrower at the UW in  was  up . from  PERIOD This is slightly below the average debt per student borrower in Washington state as a whole factoring in fifteen other major universities which stood at  PERIOD

Washington sits well below the highest mark set by Pennsylvania with an average of  up . since  and just slightly above Utah which achieved the lowest average at  up . since  PERIOD

However  is nothing to scoff at and the prodigious percentage increases in all three states are undeniably terrifying PERIOD How are people at UW ending up with this debt

Currently nearly  of UW undergraduates rely on financial aid PERIOD The university provides about  million worth each year  million of which is scholarships and grant funds PERIOD

Of firstyear students in   received financial aid PERIOD Of those  received grants or scholarships totaling  on average receiving  PERIOD Twentysix percent of that group received loan aid PERIOD Almost all were federal loans totaling  and averaging  per borrower PERIOD

With  of students still needing to take out loans free college may be further than some think at the UW and certainly nationwide PERIOD Since June  the national student debt has more than doubled from  billion to where it now stands at nearly . trillion PERIOD As a result candidates for the  democratic nomination are pushing the idea of free college to the forefront of their platforms PERIOD

The proposals are varied with Sen PERIOD Bernie Sanders urging for a complete wipeout of all student debt and tuitionfree college going forward while Sen PERIOD Elizabeth Warren proposes an incomebased debt relief program PERIOD

Former Vice President Joe Biden has yet to outline a specific plan but has in the past expressed his belief that we need to commit to  years of free public education for all our children. sen PERIOD Cory Booker has shown support by cosponsoring the Debt Free College Act and has proposed a program of government bonds given to newborns that could help lowincome families pay for their childrens college education PERIOD

Mayor Pete Buttigieg has proposed plans to make public college free for lowand middleincome families through both state and federal partnerships and an expansion of the Pell Grant PERIOD

As the  school year kicks off students are cleaning out their wallets at the bookstore at dining halls and everywhere in between PERIOD Those feeling the growing weight of nationwide student debt await an effective solution PERIOD
