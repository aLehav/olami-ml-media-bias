Peter Castillo is not your average deejay spinning to repeatable tracks and closing himself into top twenty countdowns PERIOD Acquiring his name from the abbreviation Digital Linear Tape DLT with a play on words with elite and delete DJ DeeLeeT is the program director at the Universitys radio station Radiate FM PERIOD

His vast knowledge of music and thirst for new genres allow him to play a diverse mix of music classified as acid glitch and neoelectro to goth rock PERIOD

Majoring in English he did not know the possibilities that would find him at the radio station until two years ago PERIOD He calls Radiate FM his outlet for expression brought by his self education and musical upbringing. when Castillo started out as a deejay he had two to three shows PERIOD But now as program director he has added four new shows having a show for every day of the week PERIOD The reason behind this was to promote music he felt was not currently  or ever  represented on the radio PERIOD

These shows are to fill in what I consider to be a void not only in programming but in radio within the general Florida market  The goal behind these shows is to expand peoples perception of what music can sound like and be classified as DJ Deeleet said PERIOD

Music played on these shows range from dub and trip hop lounge music punk dance rock to drum and bass genres PERIOD

He inherited one show from previous General Manager Brennan Forsyth which is called Hump Day PERIOD This show solely focuses on less recognizable eighties music to a very varied sound from song to song PERIOD

Most of the calls received during the show are about what is being played PERIOD There are a lot of split reactions from listeners either interested or confused about the variety of music PERIOD

One of his memorable calls was from a man who called saying the song playing only added to the gloominess of the situation he was in but as soon as he found out the background story of the song he grew to appreciate it PERIOD

The way one genre spawns into another and is associated with a past one and so forth is what continues to amaze me about music  I think all music borrows from each other to the point that it is incestuous Castillo said PERIOD

When asked how he prepares for his shows Peter said he uses a lot of sound bites to liven up the transition from song to song that he spends hours on end researching PERIOD

The shows Sonic Bedlam and Amnesia are premixed hours before Saturday and Sunday nights shows Dreameater and The International Beat are pure playlist songs shows while Tuesdays  bpm show is mixed live by Castillo PERIOD

Handling these shows has created lack of sleep and an addiction to energy drinks for Castillo but to him the results are far worth the sacrifice PERIOD The reason behind all this ambition is to constantly try to secure this stations reputation as one of the best college radio stations in the country. peter believes modern day radio DJs rely more on their broadcasting personalities while  Castillo likes his employees and himself to have an open mind to the different music styles out there and showcase them to the Miami audience PERIOD

DJ DeeLeeT emphasizes the importance of having DJs with a vast knowledge of music so that they wont sound like everyone else as opposed to having onair personality PERIOD

We are representing a product to the better portion of South Florida and worldwide on the Internet he said PERIOD

As program director Castillo has to supervise what is being broadcasted  air promos PSAs station tags show names DJ names issuing rotation and specialty shows PERIOD

He is second in command at WRGP PERIOD  Castillo hopes to work for Indie . in Los Angeles while attending UCLA School of Law in the future PERIOD
