Eyewitnesses have reported that Storke Tower the proud phallic symbol of UC Santa Barbara has  devastatingly  gone flaccid PERIOD The 175foottall tower which was first erected in front of the University Center in  nice may be a little tired experiencing a bout of performance anxiety or might just not be in the mood right now PERIOD Speculations about what may have caused the once rockhard monolith to go limp have already begun to circulate amongst the student body PERIOD

The little guy is going on  years old its not uncommon for things like this to happen at that age empathized one onlooker PERIOD

Some wellmeaning students have dedicated themselves to helping the tower get back up to its old skywardstretching self PERIOD Efforts have included the likes of sensual dances virgin sacrifices and even a matchmaking attempt between Storke and the foxy little air traffic control tower of the nearby Santa Barbara airport PERIOD Sadly these efforts have yet to arouse the landmark and the rigidity of the tower has continued to steadily decline PERIOD

The Nexus reached out to experts in the engineering department for comment on the structural integrity of the rapidly deflating campanile but were met with blank expressions as they had never seen anything of this sort and didnt know enough about romancing to produce a solution PERIOD They did however mention that without the Towers phallic stature radiating sexual vibes across campus like radio waves UCSBs hotness ranking was dropping by the second PERIOD

Some students however have embraced the Towers new flaccid state citing beliefs that the Tower shouldnt be held to a higher standard than anyone else PERIOD Supporters have even gathered under the tower to protect its right to relax for once calling for more realistic expectations of our architecture PERIOD Sporting signs claiming soft is the new sexy these individuals urge us to accept and love our campus phallus unconditionally PERIOD

Hell I spend most of the day flaccid PERIOD Its only fair to give Storke Tower a break every once in a while offered one protester beneath the sagging spire PERIOD

God knows Id be hard pressed to keep a stiffy day in and day out outside even in the pouring rain offered another student completely unprompted PERIOD

As of now an order has been placed for a massive Viagra to help rectify Storkes posture but until it arrives its up to the students of the hottest UC campus to arouse our most Freudian landmark PERIOD
