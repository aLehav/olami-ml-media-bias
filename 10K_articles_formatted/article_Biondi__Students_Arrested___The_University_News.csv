Along with  SLU students faculty and staff Biondi crossed the line to protest the School of the Americas PERIOD

The death of these Jesuit martyrs and of countless disenfranchised children men and women compelled me to attend Biondi stated PERIOD

My involvement was a very personal spiritual experience that should not be used as a sound clip on radio or television. all protesters who crossed the line risked being arrested and faced a severalthousanddollar fine and jail time PERIOD

However most protesters including Biondi who crossed the line were bused away to be fingerprinted and arrested PERIOD They were formally served with a banandbar letter PERIOD The letter states that the protester cannot legally set foot on the base for the next five years PERIOD

Later in the day the protesters were released by being dropped off at one of two local parks several miles from Fort Benning PERIOD

Sherry Leveille  traveled  hours from Redwing Minn. to the protest PERIOD Leveille crossed the line in  when she was served a banandbar letter PERIOD

It was hard not to cross this year she said PERIOD Everyone that I came with this year crossed the line except for me. protesters who were not arrested had the option to simply walk out of the base PERIOD

During his speech to thousands of protesters on Sunday Biondi said he was proud to represent the other  presidents of Jesuit universities PERIOD Im also proud of the SLU contingency he said PERIOD
