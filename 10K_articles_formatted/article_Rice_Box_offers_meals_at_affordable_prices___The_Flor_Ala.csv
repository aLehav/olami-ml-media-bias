Members of The FlorAla staff ordered four meals at Rice Box Asian Cuisine for under . it is no wonder the restaurant won over  percent of the votes for best offcampus restaurant PERIOD

Chicago Caf placed second with almost  percent and Ricatonis Italian Grills came in third with  percent of the votes PERIOD Because of this victory incoming staff and I ventured to Rice Box Asian Cuisine March  with one goal in mind Finding cheap food PERIOD

Associate Life Editor Monday Sanderson Graphic Designer Michael Meigs Junior Graphic Designer Jackie Willis and I arrived at Rice Box around  p.m PERIOD We had previously decided to order the cheapest meals we thought we would enjoy to see how little a group of four could spend on quality food at the restaurant PERIOD We had all eaten at Rice Box before but finding ways to make it more cost efficient made it an adventure PERIOD

After a 10minute wait a waitress sat our party at a corner booth PERIOD After perusing the menu we discovered the cheapest option would be ordering from the kids menu PERIOD

Jackie and I ordered honey sesame chicken and Michael and Monday ordered sweet and sour chicken PERIOD Everyone ordered rice as the accompanying starch varying between fried and white rice PERIOD All meals without tax were . and Monday added two eggrolls for  cents to her meal PERIOD

The eggroll appetizer arrived first and the four of us managed to split it PERIOD From the two bites I had I found the eggrolls fresh crunchy and flaky PERIOD That combined with sips of my free water temporarily staved off my hunger PERIOD

Ordering from the kids menu proved to be a smart decision PERIOD When my meal arrived my first impression was there was plenty of honey sesame chicken broccoli and fried rice to fill me up PERIOD

The chicken drenched in almost toosweet sauce still maintained its crunchiness PERIOD When the food arrived it was still steaming PERIOD Although I would have liked more egg in the rice It was filling and had a sufficiently fried flavor PERIOD

I also wished for cooked broccoli as well instead of having cold sprouts on the plate PERIOD

With Mondays sweet and sour chicken she said although the carrots were a little dry overall her kids meal left her full with plenty to go. michael said he preferred more than bell peppers and carrots as the vegetables in his dish but he found it delicious nonetheless PERIOD

Jackie said although she would have had food to take home if she had the regular menu version of her meal she found the kids size perfect. as the meal ended we received our bills PERIOD Jackies and my combined total was . michaels total was . and Mondays total was . pERIOD Four people dining for less than  should be another reason to visit this best offcampus restaurant. to see the rest of the results for the Students Choice section check out theApril  issueof The FlorAla PERIOD
