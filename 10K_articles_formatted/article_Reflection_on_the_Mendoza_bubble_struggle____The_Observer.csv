Letter to the Editor  Thursday April  

In my four years at Notre Dame Ive collected a lot of secrets PERIOD I know the best time of day to sneak food out of the dining hall PERIOD I know which offices have the best candy dishes  Theology thank me later PERIOD I can even tell you the best bench locations categorized by mood time of day squirrel visibility etc PERIOD But my biggest ND secret turned out to be common knowledge The soap dispensers in Mendoza dont work PERIOD They havent in ages PERIOD

For the last several semesters I have stuck my hands under the dispensers waved them around gave up and settled for rinsing and drying my hands at least two or three times per week PERIOD And instead of saying something I let it go every single time PERIOD I thought maybe it was a me problem like perhaps I was using the soap dispensers incorrectly PERIOD

I believed this wholeheartedly until the day I cracked the case of the Mendoza Bubble Struggle wide open PERIOD It was a morning like any other I sat through two classes and was finishing a third when I got up to take a little break and roam the halls PERIOD On the way back from my walk I stopped in the bathroom and saw something I hadnt seen in a long time  the soap dispenser was dispensing soap PERIOD And not only that it was dispensing soap all on its own PERIOD

The ridiculous sight of the sink overflowing with foam lit a fire in me PERIOD I decided to day was the day I get to the bottom of this soap business PERIOD I went to tell the lady at the desk of the Mendoza Library that the soap machine was running haywire and she told me she was aware of the problem PERIOD I mentioned that they have never worked before and she explained to me that someone came to fix them months ago but it didnt work out for some reason and today they were finally getting fixed PERIOD

I spent the rest of the day stewing in the foolishness of this seemingly trivial situation PERIOD Perhaps I was just procrastinating but perhaps I was on to something PERIOD This event certainty wasnt my first time feeling alone on this campus I am a firstgeneration black student from a lowsocioeconomic background who struggles with Bipolar disorder PERIOD But just like with the Bubble Struggle there were people around me who were working through the same thing in silence PERIOD

It wasnt just me who couldnt get the soap dispensers to work it was everyone PERIOD My friends PERIOD My classmates PERIOD My professors PERIOD And no one said anything all this time because no one wants to be the person to admit that they didnt just wash their hands PERIOD

It is hard to start a conversation if the subject makes us uncomfortable but silence is seldom productive PERIOD A solvable problem turned into months perhaps years of inactive soap dispensers in Mendoza PERIOD So next time you feel that you and you alone are faced with a particular problem mention it to someone PERIOD Just say it out loud and see what happens PERIOD

I think youll find that you not alone way more than you think PERIOD
