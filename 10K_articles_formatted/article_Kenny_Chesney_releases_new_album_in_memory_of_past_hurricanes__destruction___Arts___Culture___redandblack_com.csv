Kenny Chesney released his  album Songs for the Saints on July  PERIOD

With his recent Trip Around The Sun World Tour country singer Kenny Chesney was just in Atlanta in May playing guitar and performing at the MercedesBenz Stadium with Thomas Rhett and Old Dominion PERIOD Though his tour is due to wind down in August in Massachusetts Chesney decided to release his  album Songs for the Saints on July  PERIOD



The album is one of Chesneys strongest yet a comfortable blend of his signature country ballads with newfound emotion addressing the destruction left by Hurricane Irma and St PERIOD John this past year something which he was deeply affected by PERIOD The album was inspired in part by the destruction Chesney witnessed upon returning to his parttime home on St PERIOD John PERIOD According to Rolling Stone the album is his first with the Blue ChairWarner Bros PERIOD Nashville record label PERIOD

It is an album about the refugees we all have how temporary life is and the way we navigate to better places dig in and face the destruction Chesney said in a release PERIOD And as such Songs for the Saints stands up well against Chesneys other wellreceived albums PERIOD

The title song Song for the Saints kicks off the album with a gentle guitar melody and Chesneys signature vocals PERIOD Released on June  the single introduced the concept and theme behind Chesneys project the destruction and chaos left behind by the past hurricane season specifically in the Virgin Islands PERIOD

Chesney recalled Ive spent the majority of my adult life walking those beaches and hanging out in those bars and writing songs according to Billboard PERIOD The songs chorus ties the idea of rebirth and rebuilding together with the lines We say we can when they say we cant and With blood sweat and tears and a new coat of paint. get Along is the feelgood track of the album PERIOD With a soft beat and a bouncing melody the song begs the question Cant we all get along The song was released in April  and it harnesses the power of getting along and loving each other through everything from a changing political climate to environmental struggles PERIOD For this reason it presents itself as arguably the strongest single of Songs for the Saints sonically and conceptually PERIOD

Chesney explores the idea of ditching his fame fortune and popularity for a pirates life in his single Pirate Song. on his personal Instagram account Chesney wrote Its a long song to everything the islands have always been freedom time slowing down being calm and at sea. and indeed it seems to be PERIOD

The motifs of leaving the stresses and worries behind and just sailing away is a popular theme while the line about St PERIOD Christopher on a silver chain is familiar to anyone with Catholic roots PERIOD As St PERIOD Christopher is the patron saint of travel hes a perfect fit and the line sticks out though the track as a whole can be relatable to anyone PERIOD As he mentioned in his post Anyone whos got a job a schedule a list of responsibilities and people to answer to understands that yearning to be free. one of the most beautiful tracks on Songs for the Saints is actually a cover of the  Lord Huron hit Ends of the Earth. its fitting for Chesneys album too as the idea of going to the ends of the Earth fits the albums themes of rebirth rebuilding and heading out into the unknown. songs for the Saints wraps up with a collaboration with singersongwriter Mindy Smith with Better Boat feat PERIOD Mindy Smith. the track though softer and more serious highlights an important concept the idea of letting go and riding the waves you cant control. chesney declares that although the seas are rough hes learning how to build a better boat. chesney is no stranger to the country genre PERIOD After all Songs for the Saints is his seventeenth studio album and as stripped is it is showcases the both his talent and heartbreak over his destroyed second home the Virgin Islands PERIOD In an Instagram post Chesney explained SONGSFORTHESAINTS isnt about the destruction and devastation as much as it is the beauty of life in the islands and the way its people create a life thats their own. if you like adventure and physical activity.. PERIOD
