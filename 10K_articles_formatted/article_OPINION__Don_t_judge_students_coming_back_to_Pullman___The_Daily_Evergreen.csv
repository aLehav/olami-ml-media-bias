LAUREN PETTIT

Students who stayed in Pullman are not still there to have the standard college experience PERIOD They stayed because of money and jobs PERIOD

DANIELLE DENNEHYApril  

Across the board it is just a Coug thing to consider Pullman home PERIOD We post pictures throughout every break reminiscing on the times we miss on the Palouse PERIOD Always finding our way back home has never been as difficult as it is right now PERIOD While the university remained open it advised students to only return if necessary PERIOD

Most of our peers have remained at their permanent addresses in family homes isolating around the country PERIOD For some however the need to come back to Pullman was extremely real for many different reasons PERIOD Having the luxury of a permanent address that is both home and a positive place is something that a lot of people take for granted PERIOD

Oncampus employees faced the interesting dilemma of whether they would still be employed in Pullman PERIOD For some this is their only source of income and they depend on it for funding their tuition or any of their finances PERIOD Their jobs were not guaranteed even if they did come back but for many it was their best chance at maintaining an income in the current economic downturn PERIOD

Alexandra MacCord was working two jobs before spring break needing both to finance her academic and Greek careers PERIOD Her original plan for the weeks following our time off was to work around  hours a week between both CallaCoug and Southside Cafe PERIOD Coming back to campus was almost a nondecision as she had limited options otherwise PERIOD

School and life just go hand in hand when youre on campus in a way that home could never do MacCord said PERIOD The focus I need to remain academically driven is something that the campus just helps as well as staying at home being quite difficult and stressful. she is one of many students who consider Pullman to be their real home PERIOD Though she is only a freshman the things she is feeling about needing to be here resonate across the classes PERIOD For me that is also why I came back PERIOD The need to be in Pullman seems almost apparent to me when I think about taking six online classes basically all on my own PERIOD

I had to come back for my internship but I really appreciate being here PERIOD Being able to at least take grad photos walk around campus and really take in my last few weeks at the place Ive loved getting to call home for the past four years said Paige Thompson a kinesiology and sports science major PERIOD

For seniors the rapid end to one of the most important times in their lives has left a lot of them feeling crushed PERIOD Thompson is one of the lucky ones who had to be here and because of that she has gotten to enjoy some of the little things a lot of students are missing PERIOD For many of us who are back in Pullman right now it was not as much of a choice as you might think it was PERIOD

Whether it was a job or a lease holding them to the Palouse the ones of who are here will openly tell you its not the same PERIOD Being here is an interesting perspective to have on social distancing PERIOD There are handfuls of friends clustered around the town all separately together and shockingly enough many are obeying their parents instructions and avoiding large gatherings PERIOD

I think that if all of us could still be here we would but if we all were here it would be nearly impossible to do the things we all must do PERIOD None of this is a personal attack on our college careers  though for some it may feel that way  and it is important to recognize the good we are all doing for our community by staying apart PERIOD Cougs help Cougs and in order to help each other we need to stay home PERIOD But if its any consolation Pullman misses all of you as much as you miss it PERIOD
