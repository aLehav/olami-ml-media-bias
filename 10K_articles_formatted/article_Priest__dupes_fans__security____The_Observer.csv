Marcela Berrios  Thursday September  

A man posing as a priest fooled football fans and security personnel Sept PERIOD  when he and his twoman camera crew marched into Notre Dame Stadium  and onto the field  without credentials as an unauthorized prank during the Georgia Tech season opener PERIOD

Assistant Vice President for News and Information Dennis Brown said Wednesday the man dressed in a black outfit and a white clerical collar joined the marching band during its pregame concert at Bond Hall and led the procession to the stadiums entrance PERIOD There the man and his two assistants eluded security personnel walking down the tunnel until they were on the field PERIOD

Once there Brown said the man continued his impersonation and started conducting interviews on the sidelines until the players rushed onto the field PERIOD He greeted them with words of encouragement PERIOD

It looked like he was a Catholic priest and part of a legitimate NBC crew videotaping the band Brown said PERIOD The security personnel at the north entrance made an honest mistake making this assumption and they didnt check for credentials. brown said the individuals crew used a camera with NBC logos on it PERIOD

Thats why the stadium security staff wasnt as diligent as they would normally be in terms of checking credentials Brown said PERIOD

The third man in the crew was holding a boom microphone he said PERIOD On Sept PERIOD  a University official received an email from the pranksters which was forwarded to Browns office PERIOD

He said the impersonator explained the prank to the University and asked for Notre Dames permission to submit the video to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. brown denied the mans request PERIOD

The video was however available to users on YouTube until Tuesday when it was pulled off PERIOD Brown said his office was not responsible for the videos YouTube deletion PERIOD

He also refused to release the pranksters name or say if the man was affiliated with the University PERIOD

Weve decided not to release the persons name because it would embarrass that person and expose that person to ridicule Brown said PERIOD

A Tonight Show spokeswoman told The South Bend Tribune the man was not working on NBCs behalf and that the Leno program does not accept unsolicited material PERIOD

On Sept PERIOD  The Observer received a fax explaining the prank and announcing its possible transmission during The Tonight Show. the fax said the man wore a priests garb and marched with the band blessing spectators and cheering for the Irish along the way PERIOD The man then made his way into the stadium to pose with the teams signature Play like a champion today sign and greet the players as they rushed onto the field according to the fax PERIOD

Brown said field credentials or pregame field passes are required to have access to these places PERIOD The three men did not have either type of clearance PERIOD

However Brown said the ushers failure to check their credentials was an isolated incident and should not prompt questions about the stadiums security procedures PERIOD

We have security procedures in place PERIOD They just werent followed in this particular instance. brown said PERIOD The bottom line is that this was a benign incident that serves as a valuable wakeup call for the stadiums security personnel PERIOD Other than that no changes need to be made. share This Story
