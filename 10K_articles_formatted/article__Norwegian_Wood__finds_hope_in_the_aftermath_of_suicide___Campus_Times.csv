Winter has arrived here in Rochester covering our campus in a blanket of snow and ice PERIOD

Looking up at the dreary gray sky and trekking through the snow and freezing temperatures to get to class may make many students feel even more stressed than they already are at the end of the semester PERIOD Some might find solace retreating into the comfort of a sensitive book PERIOD

If that sounds like you I have the perfect read for this winter Haruki Murakamis Norwegian Wood. haruki Murakami wrote Norwegian Wood in  though the story itself takes place in the 1960s PERIOD The novel became immensely popular among Japanese youth and it is now one of Murakamis most wellknown works PERIOD

The story is told through the sensitive yet detached lens of Toru Watanabe a college student in Tokyo PERIOD He and one of his childhood friends navigate their lives after enduring the tragedy of another of their close friends suicide years prior PERIOD

Norwegian Wood is dramatically reviewed by Politics and Prose Bookstore as a young mans hopeless and heroic first love. although this is certainly a significant overarching element the novel is so much more than that PERIOD The Guardians review of Norwegian Wood comments on how the novels landscape of winter serves as a metaphor for the theme of death it so eloquently portrays PERIOD However winter not only symbolizes the natural inevitability of death it also displays the quiescence of living things PERIOD

Norwegian Woods habitual return to winter as the story delves deeper into its characters complicated psyches portrays something thats arguably worse than life naturally reaching its final stage stagnation PERIOD

Two of the storys main characters Toru and Naoko are irrevocably tied to each other by their shared trauma PERIOD They are in many ways both wandering through an endless winter of grief and loss PERIOD Unable to process their friends suicide the two characters are pulled almost by a sinister force towards a similar fate of depression and isolation PERIOD Haruki Murakami does an excellent job of depicting how two people and society as a whole is weighed down and connected by unprocessed grief PERIOD

Norwegian Wood does provide a ray of hope however PERIOD Although many readers are bewildered by its ambiguous ending overall the novel provides a deep and empathetic insight to those suffering from depression or suiciderelated grief PERIOD",‘Norwegian Wood’ finds hope in the aftermath of suicide - Campus Times,University of Rochester
