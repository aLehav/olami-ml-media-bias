The Delta Trail is close to the main entrance to Sands Beach which now serves  percent of beachgoers PERIOD In January a cypress tree fell across the Delta Trail reducing trail use PERIOD Most Isla Vista residents access Sands Beach by bike or on foot along the bluffs and the main entrance is the most direct route to the beach PERIOD

A ropeandpost fence will delineate a 1300foot long area to direct people around the roost on the wet sand PERIOD This will protect  percent of the roost area PERIOD The majority of the beach is still available for recreational use PERIOD Many seabirds have congregated in the trial protected area  including endangered least terns and snowy plovers PERIOD The rate of disturbance of plovers has been reduced PERIOD
