This weeks open topic from SGA asks students how do you feel about Fall Break Would you want the break to come back or should the schedule remain as is

Are you kidding me

Asking us if we want to have a relaxing two days after midterms is essentially asking Do you want fries with that

Of course we do and we deserve it PERIOD Sure if you bothered to do the math that means that youre paying  for two days off assuming youre paying instate tuition. worth it to me

We promise to chill responsibly PERIOD Well most of us PERIOD

I think it would be better for us to have those couple of days off to catch up on some school work said Willow Kentzel  of Pittsburgh PERIOD

We dont actually read the medical journals but we understand how stress is a big killer PERIOD After the mindnumbing anxietyproducing hell of midterms we need to relax PERIOD Maybe even make it back for a homecooked meal PERIOD Ramen isnt brain food PERIOD

These two wonderful days the second Monday and Tuesday of October let students regroup PERIOD You could travel you could visit home and you could even breathe for a second PERIOD

Since were paying more tuition this time give us less PERIOD Two days less PERIOD

Do you miss Fall break as much as we do If you want to chime in on the topic visit Hatfields at 730pm on Wednesday for the SGA question of the week PERIOD
