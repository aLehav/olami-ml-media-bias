Mental illnesses may not be at the forefront of parents and students minds when they go off to college but young adulthood is a critical period for mental health PERIOD College is a major transition time in life where students can experience high amounts of stress shocking college culture such as drinking and drug use and a lot of social and academic pressure PERIOD

According to the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors survey of counseling center directors  percent of college counseling center directors said the number of students with significant psychological problems is a growing concern on campus PERIOD The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that  percent of mental illnesses are onset by age  and . million adults experienced a mental illness in  PERIOD

The experiences students and parents have when dealing with mental illnesses are different for everyone and vary from campus to campus but it is important to gain knowledge about what to expect and what to look out for PERIOD

More and more people are attending college but due to the many emotional financial and personal stresses psychological distress has increased and todays students lack the coping skills to succeed independently PERIOD We are not talking enough about mental health said Darcy Gruttadaro the director of advocacy and public policy at the National Alliance on Mental Illness to Time PERIOD Unfortunately its still a taboo topic. the Center for Collegiate Mental Health located at Penn State University found that anxiety depression and academic stress are the main issues driving young people to utilize oncampus health services PERIOD

In recent years college campuses have been increasing awareness around mental health because of a series of highprofile suicides and tragedies all of which have centered around mental health crises PERIOD

One of the most notable cases was the massacre at Virginia Tech University where a gunman shot and killed  students and faculty before committing suicide PERIOD It was later revealed that as a student he sought oncampus mental health services but was not treated effectively PERIOD

In response to the increased awareness on campus the number of students seeking help for mental health issues is rising PERIOD One possible reason for this is the change in American culture PERIOD

People are becoming more comfortable talking about mental health issues and bringing their problems to trained experts PERIOD Social media has also played an important role with individuals sharing their stories inspiring others to take control of their life and seek help PERIOD

FIU offers a program called Counseling and Psychological Services which provides mental health services to students to facilitate and enhance their personal learning emotional wellbeing and academic skills development PERIOD Wendy Ordonez Coordinator of Outreach  Educational Media shared that CAPS offers many resources to determine whether ones stressanxiety levels are within normal ranges PERIOD The program also offers workshops to help students determine their causes of stress and how to reduce it PERIOD

In addition CAPS has been using a treatment known as Therapist Assisted Online TAO since spring  which is a  week Online treatment program that uses cognitive behavioral therapy modules that includes videos and informational presentations to help treat anxiety PERIOD

Each module teaches clients about what causes depression and anxiety how to identify common symptoms and personal triggers and what strategies and techniques people can use to overcome their problems PERIOD In addition clients can face time with a counselor get access to interactive videos and reading and self reflection assignments PERIOD According to CAPS over  percent of students are satisfied and over  percent would recommend TAO to a friend PERIOD 
Panthers deserve to live a full rich life free of as much stress and pressure as possible so taking a stance standing by each other and seeking help when needed is essential to living such a life PERIOD
