7668,1970-01-01,"americans laugh at themselves sometimes because they have set aside a special day on which to be thankful for all the good things that have come their way during the year PERIOD Thanksgiving is more likely to recall to their minds a picture of a table loaded with tasty dishes and of a quiet day spent with close friends and relatives PERIOD

Even if the meaning of Thanksgiving is somewhat obscured by these more present realities the holiday has an atmosphere that adds something to American life PERIOD There is some of the peacefulness and good will of the Christmas season without the frantic rush of gift shopping PERIOD There is a recollection of the historical past of the nation a memory of common people building a new life in a wilderness PERIOD It isnt a day for pride in military might or celebration of a victory PERIOD

Within its atmosphere we are drawn more closely to family and friends PERIOD Home seems more important and we center our attentions on its activities instead of looking for outside excitement PERIOD

This year Thanksgiving will be more heartfelt than it has since the beginning of the war PERIOD Some of the tension of the war years has been released and Americans will give thanks with more faith PERIOD

For us as students Thanksgiving this year means a vacation from classes and a reunion with the family and friends at home PERIOD In the years when traveling was frowned upon we learned to appreciate the privilege of spending this particular holiday at home PERIOD

We may laugh at ourselves for setting aside such a day but we have come to realize that it means more to us than surface impressions may indicate PERIOD
