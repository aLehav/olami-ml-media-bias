Representation in mainstream media is crucial for developing and nurturing cultural identity PERIOD For a long time pop music was restricted to how many times a song could be requested on the radio by listeners PERIOD However with the invention of platforms like Spotify and SoundCloud it is now possible to find niche music that applies to ones own individual identity PERIOD

The past few weeks had big news for queer musicians PERIOD Aint Together a sneak peek at King Princess upcoming album Cheap Queen was released on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Girl in Red a Norwegian bedroom pop artist released her album chapter  on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

Sam Smith just publicly announced on Sept PERIOD  that they use theythem pronouns PERIOD

Lil Nas X came out as gay this summer after the success of his song Old Town Road. mikaela Straus better known as King Princess has a strong following at Mount Holyoke PERIOD Her confident and playful personality is easily found in her music PERIOD With heady singles like Pussy is God and  her songs are equally as entrancing as anything from a more mainstream pop artist PERIOD Her unapologetic identity and its distinguished presence in her songs bring a new mode of gay representation into pop culture PERIOD

Rather than the focus of her music being her sexuality its more about nuanced relationships between her and other women PERIOD In her new song Aint Together Straus explores a disagreement over labels and the status of a relationship questioning whether or not it will change the way it feels to be together PERIOD

Girl in Red is also gaining confidence and strength in her music PERIOD Rather than the desperate pleadings of i want to be your girlfriend her new singles speak more about interpersonal relationships and looking back on mistakes PERIOD She sings about setting boundaries and needing time alone as well as feeling in over her head in a relationship that was a bad idea. music by and for queer people is beautifully unique in that it speaks specifically to LGBTQ experiences PERIOD However that same beauty limits its mainstream success PERIOD Whether that is caused by the subject matter of the music or the identity of the artists is unclear PERIOD However what we do know is that King Princess is not on the Billboard Top  PERIOD Asking for songs like Pssy is God to become a radio hit might not be a reasonable request but knowing that there are queer artists on the charts is exciting in itself PERIOD

Songs by queer artists arent necessarily representative because they have queer content but because of the identity of the artists PERIOD For instance Sam Smiths single Stay With Me doesnt hinge on their genderqueer identity or sexuality as do some of their other songs like HIM PERIOD Its just a pop song like anything from a straight cisgender artist PERIOD Lil Nas X rose to the top of the Billboard charts before coming out PERIOD His success was never contingent on his sexuality PERIOD

So the question is does being labeled as a queer artist delay a musicians career as opposed to starting with no labels Alternatively do we need to identify with music to enjoy it Hearing music from explicitly queer musicians creates a nuanced and specific feeling for the listener the feeling of being understood and having your life celebrated and sung about like anyone elses PERIOD However it is equally exciting to hear queer pop stars on the radio even when the content of their songs isnt explicitly referencing queer experiences PERIOD
