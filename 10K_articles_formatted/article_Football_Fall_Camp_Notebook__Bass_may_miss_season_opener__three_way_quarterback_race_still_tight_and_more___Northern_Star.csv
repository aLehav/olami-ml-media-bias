By  Frank GogolaAugust  

With footballs season opener just more than one week away the Huskies may very well be down a leader on defense early on as they continue their search for the offenses new leader PERIOD

Jamaal Bass may not play in season opener

Jamaal Bass redshirt senior outside linebacker could miss the season opener against the Presbyterian Blue Hose on Aug PERIOD  head coach Rod Carey said after Tuesdays practice PERIOD

Bass a  AllMAC First Team selection and the Huskies leading returning tackler missed all of spring camp while recovering from offseason surgery and has been restricted practicewise in fall camp PERIOD

Hes been really really limited in fall camp practice Carey said PERIOD I dont know that hell be ready for the first game PERIOD I honestly dont know that hell be ready for the first game PERIOD Hes progressing I can tell you that PERIOD Hes looking better every day but I dont think hes close enough to be playing the first game yet. quarterback battle lingers on

While the quarterback race has been in full tilt since spring camp Carey said no one has separated themselves yet to win the starting job PERIOD

Redshirt junior Matt McIntosh and redshirt sophomores Drew Hare and Anthony Maddie continue to duke it out on the field and Carey said all three played really well in Thursdays scrimmage and all have continued to elevate their game PERIOD

Carey has said since spring camp he wont run a twoQB system PERIOD With Football Championship Subdivision Presbyterian coming to DeKalb Aug PERIOD  theres always the opportunity for the coaching staff to play two or all three quarterbacks against the Blue Hose to better gauge who would make the best starting QB in  however Carey said he hasnt thought about going that route yet PERIOD

I havent gotten that far because were in a battle right now Carey said PERIOD Well do however the battle dictates. injuries

Carey said he didnt have any updates on tailback Cameron Stingilys injury following Tuesdays practice PERIOD He still expects Stingily to miss the first four games PERIOD

Carey didnt have any new player injuries to pass along saying the team looks good PERIOD
