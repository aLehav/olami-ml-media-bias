Pitt has recently released an ambitious 12year construction plan detailing projects to Pitt has recently released an ambitious 12year construction plan detailing projects to modernize various buildings across campus add a new building behind Salk Hall and improve athletic facilities PERIOD The plan is likely to cost more than  billion PERIOD

The largest and most expensive new construction at  million is the addition to be built behind Salk Hall which will have research laboratories for the pharmacy and health science schools PERIOD Construction in the athletic department is slated to cost . million and will include renovations to Trees Hall and the Fitzgerald Field House a new track and field facility and new baseball and softball fields PERIOD Other projects are intended to modernize many buildings throughout Oakland including Benedum Hall which will undergo a  million renovation PERIOD

Vice provost for academic planning and resources management Robert Pack told the Pittsburgh PostGazette that the plan will ensure that we remain one of the most successful and competitive universities in the country. all of this sounds promising PERIOD What Pitt student would not like to see his or her school grow and prosper as a competitive national institution Improvements will be extremely beneficial around campus where numerous buildings seem as though they are still trapped in  PERIOD

But Pitt seems to be missing the bigger picture PERIOD While a  billion modernization and new construction plan will greatly help Pitt progress it does not address the other problems that are holding our university back PERIOD

For one thing while universities across the nation are making their buildings more environmentally friendly Pitt does not seem to be taking the environment into account in its plans PERIOD Energy efficiency was not specified in the Universitys construction projects PERIOD We hope that this was just an accidental omission PERIOD If not we encourage Pitt to make sure all the additions and renovations will be environmentally friendly PERIOD

Furthermore part of being a progressive university is the ability to attract lowincome students PERIOD A portion of that  billion could be put to better use in improving Pitts financial aid policy and creating more needbased scholarships for students who cannot afford tuition making our university accessible to more students PERIOD

Of course not all of the blame can be placed on Pitt PERIOD Much of this money comes from alumni who seem to be more concerned with seeing their names on newly constructed buildings as opposed to helping Pitt students with their tuition PERIOD But there is also money coming straight from the Universitys Educational and General budget that could be more efficiently used PERIOD

We would like to see Pitt compete on a national level but these improvements should be extended to other areas as well PERIOD This is a good start but theres a lot more to modernization than sleek new buildings PERIOD
