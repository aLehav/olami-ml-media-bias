Every year the Utes are in the same unfortunate spot as other winter schools in that practically their entire preseason training schedule has to take place indoors PERIOD In the three weeks prior to their season opener against the Broncos last Friday the Utes practiced in the Spence Eccles Field House which helps them get all the requisite practice in when the weather gets in the waywhich in Salt Lake City in February it usually does PERIOD

Its an adjustment for the eyes and the body Kinneberg said PERIOD His Utes were able to get one day of outdoor practice in before taking on Santa Clara for a threegame set the result of which was Ute losses but the change clearly had an impact PERIOD
Kinneberg said he expected some of that going into his teams opening series but admitted I still thought wed execute a little better than we did. in three games the team managed just seven runs despite  hits PERIOD
Shimada who went 1for11 in the series said he and his teammates clearly adjusted over the course of the weekend PERIOD It was better on Sunday the sophomore said PERIOD We were seeing the ball a lot better and wed sorta gotten used to it. they certainly werent seeing the ball last Friday as they were shutout  PERIOD But as Shimada said they settled down as the weekend wore on dropping each of the final two games of the series by one run PERIOD Once they were used to the sunshine rather than the dimmeddown lighting and static atmosphere of the practice field it was basically back to normal PERIOD
Of course once the team returned home it was back indoorsfor the most part at least PERIOD Returning to Salt Lake City for an uncharacteristically warm February week the Utes got a chance to spend a few hours practicing outdoors at the nearby McCarthy Field where the football team usually practices PERIOD Now the Utes will be back on the road and back in the sun this weekendand they expect their eyes to adjust a little quicker now that they have three games under their collective belt PERIOD
