As anyone who has visited the W.E.B PERIOD DuBois library during finals week can tell you the life of a college student is not always easy PERIOD After countless papers and exams another semester in Amherst was coming to an end and I found myself returning home more than ready for some rest and relaxation PERIOD But after spending the last few months speaking to advisors and filling out form after form I suddenly found myself on a plane headed to Oviedo Spain with no idea of what awaited me on the other side PERIOD

Roughly twelve hours after taking off from Bostons Logan International Airport I stumbled out of the cabin and into a new and much greener world than the one I had left PERIOD No Im not talking about the snow PERIOD Oviedo is the capital city of the Principality of Asturias a stunningly beautiful region of mountains cliffs and rivers and one of the most soughtafter hiking destinations in all of Western Europe PERIOD The landscape is full of picturesque images of towering green cliffs softly rolling hills and scenes of morning fog punctured by a dazzling Spanish sun PERIOD After spending some time in Asturias shooting the film Vicky Cristina Barcelona famed actor and director Woody Allen could only describe it as like a fairytale saying Its as if it doesnt belong to this world as if it could not possibly exist according to telegraph.co.uk PERIOD As I rode the bus which took me closer and closer to my final destination I could only stare helplessly out the window as this new and wondrous world passed me by PERIOD

Despite being surrounded by such a natural paradise one of the nicest things about living in Spain is the openness and kindness of the Spaniards themselves PERIOD A wellknown Spanish and Mediterranean custom is the famous dos besos or the practice of greeting one another with a kiss on each cheek PERIOD Though I was aware of this custom when I first arrived my unfamiliarity with it has made for some rather amusing though enlightening cultural missteps PERIOD After hurriedly and uncomfortably performing this ritual with one of my host mothers friends she jokingly chastised me in broken English saying simply Here we kiss PERIOD Since then Ive learnt to open myself up more to new cultural experiences PERIOD While abroad its wise to remember the old saying When in Rome do as the Romans do. there is a definite rhythm to Spanish life which contrasts sharply with the frenetic rush we often find ourselves in at home PERIOD The pace of living is one organized on a human level where each person is encouraged to savor all of the joys and delights that each day has to offer PERIOD One of the strongest examples of this is found during the typical Spanish midday meal PERIOD Every afternoon the city comes to a screeching halt as doors are locked windows closed and shutters pulled PERIOD What could possibly be the cause of such a mysterious ritual Nothing less than the famous Spanish siesta of course PERIOD However the siesta is not merely a midday nap PERIOD It is a time for people to pause and think to go home and visit their loved ones and to enjoy a sincere social experience PERIOD I have come to love this custom dearly PERIOD Each day I return home to a delicious meal a wonderfully kind host family and a conversation which stirs me back to life after a long day in class PERIOD Though meals in Spain often last for two hours or more there is good reason for this it is impossible to savor the small pleasures of life when you find yourself running past them at breakneck speed PERIOD As we sit talk and laugh I am reminded that sometimes its best to pause take a breath and marvel at la bella vida before it passes us by PERIOD As the saying goes Viva la vida PERIOD
