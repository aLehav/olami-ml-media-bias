The college blackout culture has long been an issue in dire need of attention PERIOD It is common for college students to drink in excess causing problems such as addiction and hospitalization PERIOD Some universities across the country have attempted to take a stand against this issue of binge drinking by implementing a ban on hard alcohol PERIOD

The University of NebraskaLincoln is the next one in line PERIOD UNLs Interfraternity Council has approved a hard alcohol ban effective Aug PERIOD   PERIOD Any beverages containing above  alcohol will no longer be allowed in fraternities or at offcampus fraternity events PERIOD This ban is intended to decrease the amount of alcoholrelated incidents occurring at these events PERIOD

This ban will be in effect once the  school year starts PERIOD Although guidelines are not set in stone yet fraternities caught with hard alcohol will be required to attend an alcohol education course PERIOD Any further offenses will result in fines PERIOD

While banning hard alcohol like vodka and tequila in favor of beer or malt liquor may seem like a productive idea it will likely not be feasible or effective PERIOD Despite the Interfraternity Councils admirable motives in implementing a hard alcohol ban there is no way of ensuring students will actually follow it PERIOD Stating there will be a ban is not enough to stop students from consuming copious amounts of hard alcohol PERIOD

The banning of hard alcohol at fraternity events is UNLs way of standing with other bigname universities like Harvard or Dartmouth PERIOD Because this ban is a fairly new thing for universities across the United States there is insufficient data to show that a ban is effective at all PERIOD

A survey of Dartmouth students found  of the student body consumed hard alcohol after the ban was put into place PERIOD Universities who have a ban still deal with students drinking in excess resulting in the same alcoholrelated problems as universities that do not have a ban PERIOD On the other hand a report by Harvards College Alcohol Study shows that colleges that enforce a ban have a  decrease in heavy drinkers and an increase in students choosing to abstain from alcohol PERIOD

What could be the case here is that some schools such as Harvard actually enforce this ban PERIOD They provide rehabilitation programs and addiction counseling to students who are caught violating this ban PERIOD Other universities such as Dartmouth do not enforce their ban on hard alcohol stating students punishment is left up to the law PERIOD

Further guidelines should come with the ban such as how the university will keep track of what its students are providing at parties and what the punishments will mean for their educational career PERIOD Schools should also provide students with assistance if they are struggling with alcoholism or peer pressure to conform to the binge drinking culture PERIOD

Many universities such as Stanford and the University of Virginia put bans in place as a way of curbing the occurrence of traumatic events like sexual assault and gang rape which are often associated with excessive consumption of alcohol PERIOD

While this action is intended for good it does not address what lies at the core of sexual assault and rape PERIOD This sort of response makes alcohol seem like the reason people are being sexually assaulted rather than lack of education on consent PERIOD To put so much of the blame on alcohol is an ignorant assumption to make PERIOD It solves a symptom of the problem rather than the actual problem itself PERIOD Though UNLs motives are unclear if this is the reason behind its decision to implement the ban it is misguided and not the right way to deal with this issue PERIOD

Alcohol though a factor is not the reason that rates of sexual assault on campus always seem to be so high PERIOD By instilling a ban in response to those cases of sexual assault it is placing the blame on a substance rather than on ones actions PERIOD If universities want to protect students from such things an alcohol ban is not the right answer PERIOD

While a ban does address the issue of binge drinking on college campuses it is difficult to enforce and should have further guidelines as to how it will be enacted PERIOD Though the university says it is serious about addressing the issues of drinking and underage drinking a blanket ban will not be powerful enough to stop students from getting wasted on the weekends PERIOD

If UNL wants to see success with the ban the university needs to create strict guidelines and a concrete plan for students to follow if they violate the ban PERIOD It is idealistic to think that simply stating a ban exists will lower the amount of students who choose to drink PERIOD The fact that the university wants to take some sort of action is optimistic but it is extremely debatable as to whether this ban will make a difference at all PERIOD
