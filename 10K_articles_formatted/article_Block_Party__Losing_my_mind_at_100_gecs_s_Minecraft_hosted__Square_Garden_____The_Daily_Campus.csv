Jumping up and down at a concert is a commitment PERIOD You need to make sure you check your pockets every once in a while to make sure that your phonewalletdrugsetc PERIOD havent fallen victim to gravity or anyone with loose hands PERIOD You want to make sure that youre jumping in line with the rest of your sweaty concertgoers PERIOD And if youre like me and not the most in shape you want to make sure not to expend all your energy throughout the night PERIOD On Friday I had none of those concerns since all I had to do to go wild was hit the spacebar of my laptop PERIOD

Thats because I wasnt really at a concert PERIOD I was but not quite PERIOD I attended  gecss Square Garden concert and fundraiser a multiartist event hosted completely on Minecraft PERIOD Featuring a whos who of cuttingedge hyperpop artists including Kero Kero Bonito and Charli XCX the concert lasted about four hours front to back and raked in thousands of attendees. i was fortunate enough to be one of them logging on around  p.m PERIOD Unlike some real life concerts Ive been fortunate enough to attend I didnt have to pay for parking split a Lyft or even sprint after a subway PERIOD The commute was two floors up from my kitchen to my office PERIOD The event itself was free with a  VIP access tier for anyone who wanted a special ingame tag and private Discord to hang with the artists PERIOD And of course you would need to have Minecraft which I bought almost a decade prior to the event for around  PERIOD

Minecraft has been one of the most influential multiplayer games for quite some time now and its not surprising to see thousands of players on a server at once PERIOD Unfortunately Minecraft isnt built for virtual concerts  its a game about breaking blocks with tools and killing skeletons PERIOD There is no platform uniquely created for hosting virtual concerts although considering these unique times it may be in development as I type this PERIOD  gecss server had trouble hosting the 5000ish who tried to be there in person instead of watching on Twitch or YouTube PERIOD I was one of them trying futilely to lag my way towards the open pit the server designers had made for the event PERIOD Within my  minutes of earnest attempts to persevere through the server and my laptops shortcomings of this strange situation I had presented them with I was booted from the server several times due to latency issues PERIOD By that point I didnt want to miss any of the marquee artists and I turned on the Twitch stream PERIOD

The concert ran for eight hours and while it was difficult to get in those who did attend enjoyed great music and the virtual company of others PERIOD It has also inspired other organizations to begin throwing their own concerts PERIOD Photo via Twitter IAmBlindProphet PERIOD

The stage itself was fairly unassuming considering the global fanbase of Charli PERIOD If it existed in real life it may have seated two to three hundred magnitudes short of the arenas that she would sell out in an ordinary spring PERIOD That was by design as the clubstyle setup gave all of us watching from all parts of the globe a density that we havent had in quite some time PERIOD Ill never know the stories of the thousands of others in the chat and on the dance floor other than the safe assumption that they were viewing from their homes PERIOD I dont know how many of them have a family member struggling with COVID19 right now and just wanted one night of virtual ecstacy to take their mind off their grim reality PERIOD Statistically dozens were living that story or something similar to it PERIOD Between the usual Twitch spam youd catch in any major stream it peaked at around  viewers during  gecss set people were giving their gratitude to the electronic music duo for pulling this event out of thin air and improving their minimized lives PERIOD

Life feels like were stuck in this one monstrous news story that we cant escape PERIOD On Friday night myself and thousands of others did through an impossible fever dream that called itself a concert PERIOD It was a bright light in these dark times and for the first time in my life I was able to jump around without tuckering myself out PERIOD
