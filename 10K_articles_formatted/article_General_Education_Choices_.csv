Every student at Rhode Island College is required to take courses that satisfy general education requirements necessary for graduation PERIOD RICs general education program is designed to supplement the courses students take for their majors with courses that meet  learning outcomes that highlight critical skills for students PERIOD Although RIC seems to be very clear with what they expect of students why is it that so many students find themselves in situations where one or more of the general education requirements hold them back from graduating on time

The general education program requires students to take  courses that are all worth four credits each PERIOD The  courses are broken down into three core courses as well as seven that fall under the category of  distribution offerings PERIOD The three core courses wont come as a surprise to students as we have all become familiar with taking First Year Seminar First Year Writing and a Connections course PERIOD These courses are required for all programs and although students have the choice of the topic of FYS and Connections they must be satisfied by all students without exception PERIOD The Seven distribution courses refer to the selection of courses that can be taken to satisfy requirements from within various disciplines PERIOD These disciplines are also likely familiar to you and include Visual and Performing Arts History Literature Mathematics Natural Science Social and Behavioral Science Advanced Quantitative Scientific Reasoning and Second Language PERIOD The distribution courses give students more choices for the department in which the course lies as well as the topic PERIOD However how much of a choice do we really have

Looking at the general education program at The University of Rhode Island there is one significant difference in how students fulfill their requirements PERIOD Similar to RIC URIs general education program requires about  credits worth of courses that correspond with a set of learning outcomes PERIOD However URI bases their program on the outcomes rather than the core and distribution courses PERIOD In other words students are given the set of outcomes they are required to meet and can choose their courses accordingly PERIOD This gives students more choices to find general education courses that interest them or even relate to their major PERIOD Im not saying the outcome based system would be the right fit for RIC students but I do know it is now being brought into question PERIOD

My personal experience with the general education program at RIC has allowed me to connect with many faculty members and students I never would have met within my major courses PERIOD I think being required to take a wide variety of courses spread across the disciplines has its benefits by enriching students with different types of thinking in different settings PERIOD However in a society that is increasingly moving towards choice based learning models the debate between course based general education vs PERIOD outcome based learning comes into play more than ever PERIOD

As the student representative for the colleges Committee on General Education I hope to investigate further what my peers think about general education at RIC and let them give their personal opinions on the program PERIOD I also hope to use their feedback to speak on behalf of them and be a voice for them PERIOD Stay tuned for more
