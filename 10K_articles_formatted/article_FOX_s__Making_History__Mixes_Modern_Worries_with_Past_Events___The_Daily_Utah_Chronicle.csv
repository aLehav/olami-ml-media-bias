394,2023-10-23,"making History FOXs new primetime television series premieres this Sunday with ablend of slapstick comedy with a perioddriven plot to create a unique package PERIOD

The tale kicks off with Dan a university facilities manager played by Adam Pally recruiting the help of Chris a history professor Yassir Lester in the hopes of setting history back on track PERIOD It turns out that Dan has been carelessly traveling back in time in order to date a colonial woman Leighton Meesterwho just so happens to be Paul Reveres daughter PERIOD As a result ofDansactions in dating her Reveres midnight ride never happens resulting intheAmerican Revolution never taking place PERIOD In this mess it now becomes up to these two wisecracking coworkers and Reveres daughter to fix time PERIOD

Creator writer and executive producer Julius Sharpe has acquired notoriety for his work on the Emmy awardwinning animated show Family Guy. seth Cohen who is also the executive producer for Making History heads another FOX original series critically acclaimed Last Man on Earth. its also worth noting that the pilot was directed by Jared Hess responsible for the cult classic Napoleon Dynamite. the show boasts a fairly established cast the most wellknown name most likely being Meester known for her lead role in Gossip Girl. her character is certainly the most interesting of all and she repeatedly expresses concerns over the treatment of women in her time period bringing up themes of inequality in the process PERIOD

The showslead Pally has previously starred in a slew of indie comedies and appeared in several hit tv shows including The Mindy Project and Happy Endings. pally tends to receive the majority of the quippy punchlines throughout the show and quite a few are successful at generating chuckles out of viewers PERIOD

Lester is a standup veteran who prefersto perform primarily in Los Angeles PERIOD Lesters character tends to play the straight guy role in the series since hes accompanied by a jokester janitor and a woman from the 1700s PERIOD Hes usually at his funniest when criticizing poor choices made by the protagonist PERIOD

This story begins in colonial times and plays quite a bit with that PERIOD Clever jokes about time period are bound to arise again and again and the majority come off quite well PERIOD An interesting aspect of the series I was not expecting was its satirical treatment of modernday issues PERIOD By far my favorite moment in the second episode happened when history professor Chris must incite the men of Lexington to take arms and revolt against the British PERIOD Hisprepared speech falls entirely flat and Chris needs to come up with an alternate plan in order to sufficiently arouse the interest of these men PERIOD Thankfully he remembers something that never fails to get Americans really going PERIOD He claims that the British are threatening to attack their soon to be second amendment rights to bear arms PERIOD Without giving away too much conversation over gun laws ownership and registration arise and its not only funny but delightfully intelligent PERIOD

Making History like many other sitcoms is very mannered and overthetop which works to its disadvantage at times PERIOD A lot is thrown at the wall but even so a good deal of it sticks PERIOD If youre a fan of shows like Brooklyn NineNine and Community I definitely recommend tuning in this Sunday March  at  p.m PERIOD central time on FOX PERIOD
