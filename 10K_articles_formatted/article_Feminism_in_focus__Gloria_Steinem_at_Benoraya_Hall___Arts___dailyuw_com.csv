Editors note Its usually improper to call someone by their first name in an article like this but as Gloria said women dont really relate to their last name. on Sunday night I had the honor of attending Benaroya Hall to listen to Gloria Steinem in conversation with Cheryl Strayed PERIOD I walked into the venue expecting what I saw which was hoards of women of all ages and races buzzing about feminism PERIOD I honestly had never experienced such a gratifying and heartening environment PERIOD I could tell the fire which had been burning in the 60s and 70s was still burning but had just matured a little PERIOD For example the entire crowd cheered when Gloria said Women get more radical with age because they knew it was true and so did I PERIOD

Gloria and Cheryl walked out onto the stage of Benaroya Hall to a standing ovation PERIOD Gloria shaking the long strands of gray hair out of her face raised her hands to the audience so visibly grateful for the moment we were all about to share PERIOD

This is the Gloria Steinem who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in  supporting the Equal Rights Amendment who protested against South African apartheid who received the Presidential Medal of Honor in  and who will always be the face of the second wave of feminism PERIOD Yet it was not a night exclusively about her but a night about celebrating women a night to grow and to learn together and a night to reinvigorate the activist and the feminist in all of us PERIOD

Gloria was in Seattle for a book tour put on by Hedgebrook the writers retreat Glorias new book My Life on the Road explores all the traveling shes done in her  years PERIOD The first half of the event consisted of Cheryl asking Gloria questions and the second half was open for questions to the audience PERIOD

Cheryl opened the discussion by telling one of Glorias stories from the book PERIOD In  a young Gloria attended the March on Washington where she met an African American women named Mrs PERIOD Greene who pointed out to her that there was only one woman on that stage PERIOD Gloria credits this as one of the big clicks in her worldview where she noticed how few women were given the space they deserve PERIOD

Cheryl finished this story turning to Gloria and said I didnt have to have that moment because we had you. so many women over the course of the night shared this same sentiment PERIOD But Gloria continued to turn the conversation on its head instead using the moment to thank Mrs PERIOD Greene and to point out that African American women have always been at the forefront of social justice but are hardly recognized PERIOD This recognition of privilege was a theme throughout the night as Gloria spoke fondly of women like the late Cherokee Nation Chief Wilma Mankiller activist Florence Kennedy and fellow Ms PERIOD Magazine cofounder Dorothy Pitman Hughes all who made a difference in her feminist life and in their own social activism PERIOD

Just as the book centers on travel the night was focused on talking about Glorias own forays into transience like when she moved to India in her 20s to escape a fiancee she didnt want to marry PERIOD There she met a group of Gandhians who were involved in the caste riots of the time and experienced talking circles for the first time PERIOD

Her life so rooted in activism seemed to happen the way it did because she was running away from the life she was supposed to have  a husband children a picket fence  that were required for a woman in the 50s PERIOD The audience laughed when she said the choice in who you married was the last choice you had but it was a reality for Gloria and she had a large part in making it so that reality didnt persist PERIOD

The conversation shifted to Glorias decision to dedicate this book to Dr PERIOD John Sharpe the London physician who illegally performed an abortion on Gloria when she was  years old PERIOD Cheryl asked Gloria her thoughts on the current state of reproductive freedom to which Gloria responded that she had grossly overestimated the degree of democracy in this country PERIOD She thinks now what she thought then the politicization of womens bodies is a means to control them and it only reinforces racism and sexism PERIOD

Glorias main piece of advice in the book is to always ask the turtle. when she was in college she explained she took a geology course because it seemed like the easiest science class PERIOD During one of the field trips for the course she wandered off and found a large snapping turtle stuck in some mud near an asphalt road PERIOD Worried the turtle would crawl up onto the asphalt only to be run over Gloria picked it up and carried it over to the river watching it swim away PERIOD Her geology professor found her at that point and proceeded to tell her the turtle had probably spent months crawling into the mud in order to lay her eggs PERIOD So she said always ask the turtle. when the conversation was opened up to audience questions many women who stepped forward only wanted to thank Gloria for the effect she had on their lives PERIOD Among the nonquestions asked were Ideally Hillary needs a running mate  and an announcement by Amelia Bonow the original shoutyourabortion activist about taking prochoice activism off the defense. one woman a Whidbey Island gardener came up to the microphone to thank Gloria for coming to her garden anonymously and for being a wonderful friend PERIOD

You broke my isolation she said and thanked Gloria for respecting her though she didnt speak the best English PERIOD

The questions that were posed were sincere and inspirational PERIOD Two 15yearold girls asked What advice would you have for teenage girls to which Gloria replied Listen to yourselves PERIOD We all have a voice inside of us  trust that voice. a prostitution survivor asked How do you really make a difference as a turtle and Gloria responded with You have the credibility. her answers were empowering and beautiful exactly what I expected from such a welldefined and longstanding activist PERIOD

I could go on forever telling you what she said but most of all I believe she would want me to leave you with this Feel free to laugh PERIOD A young activist asked a question I often ask myself How do you keep from being disheartened In the world of activism being informed about all the terrible things going on in the world makes it so some days weigh heavy on you PERIOD Advice like this from someone in her 80s someone who stood for so much that I believe in was moving beyond words PERIOD

Feel free to laugh she said PERIOD Laughter is the only free emotion. you can be compelled into anger you can be compelled into love even but laughter is yours and only yours PERIOD My hope was reinstilled PERIOD After years of fighting against injustice in the world Glorias laugh is still bright and warm reminding us all that our lives are our own and peace may be possible in the end PERIOD
