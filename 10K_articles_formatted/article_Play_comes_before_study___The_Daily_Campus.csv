Last Friday April  it was impossible not to notice the array of colors balloons and tents outside Dallas Hall as students children and even Peruna flooded the quad for Mane Event PERIOD Since most of them were there just for the free food and a break from class most of them probably have no idea about the real meaning behind the event PERIOD

Mane Event was originally called Perunas Birthday and was a fairlike celebration of SMUs mascot at the end of the year Staci Talamonti Student Foundations campus events chair said PERIOD

Its been an SMU tradition since the eighties at the latest PERIOD Mane Event has had many names over the years including Block Party but the idea has remained the same an SMU tradition created by the students for students she said PERIOD

Students had a variety of different foods to pick from including Paciugos Slushies Cotton Candy Boba Tea Balls Hamburgers QuesadYas Strombolis and Texas Caribbean Turkey Legs PERIOD

All of the food was gone by  students got to play on the water slides and dunk tanks both a first got their fortunes read and had caricatures made  it seemed like everyone was able to really enjoy themselves Cathleen Good vicepresident of Programming for Student Foundation said PERIOD

A lot of planning went into such an elaborate event PERIOD

SF is a group organization  we wouldnt be able to put on any of our events without the help of our board and general members Good said PERIOD Mane Event is one of our  programming events  so the entire organization is willing to come together to make the events better every year. as chair of the event Talamonti had a sixperson committee specifically for planning Mane Event PERIOD

The efforts began in January and culminated in Mane Event last Friday she said PERIOD As chair I ran every Campus Events committee meeting on Thursdays after Student Foundations general member meetingWe all worked together very extensively on very small details such as the Paciugos gelato flavors to the big picture theme idea Aloha SMU which we thought was very appropriate after the Mustangs win in Hawaii

By the end of the afternoon many students enjoyed all the efforts put on by Student Foundation PERIOD

Mane Event was a great way to relax after a long week of classes sophomore Elizabeth Banta said PERIOD There were tons of awesome activities for everyone and lots of good foodTalamonti agrees that Mane Event was successful this year PERIOD
