Radar speed signs are tools that Florida Gulf Coast University has been utilizing for the last  years PERIOD The objective of the device is to bring awareness to the driver of the speed that they are going and what speed they should be going PERIOD So how has their presence affected faculty and students
FGCU senior Tyler Evans who has been attending the university for the last four years believes that the radar speed signs have definitely made the campus roadways safer PERIOD
A lot of the time I feel like people zone out when theyre driving especially when youre heading to class or home said Evans PERIOD You just have a million things going on in your head so usually you arent thinking about how fast youre going but if you speed past those signs they start flashing and its a wakeup call to slow down and it keeps you from getting pulled over. however Officer Myles Kittleson who has worked at the FGCU Police Department for the last five years and also pushed for the grant that funded the newest radar speed sign two years ago doesnt feel the devices have directly impacted the distribution of speeding tickets PERIOD
I only say that because theres no real way to track it because it radar speed sign doesnt actually count how many times anyone goes above or below the speed limitmore or less its just a signaling device to let you know said Kittleson PERIOD Its kind of just a prevention thing for drivers. radar speed signs work using the antenna and radar that are hooked up facing the roadway PERIOD When the vehicle begins to move towards the sign it uses the radar transmitter as well as algorithm to determine the speed PERIOD
According to Kittleson the speed sign is tested for its accuracy every month and also moved to different locations throughout campus monthly PERIOD
As stated in records from the UPD  traffic tickets have been given from  to Feb PERIOD   PERIOD Tickets for violation of traffic laws and violation of traffic control devices are included in this calculation PERIOD One hundred and fourteen of the  tickets are strictly speeding tickets PERIOD
Officers have the discretion to write a lesser ticket because of how state statute is put out you can write a speeding ticket which has a higher point value and a higher fine value said Kittleson or you can write what we call a violation of traffic laws or violation of a traffic control device so writing those tickets are a lesser fine and less pointsin turn they are trying to cut the person a break. the radar speed sign can be found in the median on FGCU Lake Parkway West although its location changes frequently PERIOD
