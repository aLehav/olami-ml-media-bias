Its a far cry from mowing lawns and babysitting for cash in the summer PERIOD In todays ultracompetitive summer internship market one company is offering students guaranteed placement  for a price PERIOD

Internships are an investment just as your fouryear education is an investment PERIOD The more experience you have the better able you are to set yourself apart from everyone else he said PERIOD Students realize and value the opportunities that internships provide. normington said that the company is more than just a placement agency PERIOD

The heart of our company  PERIOD is to inspire equip and challenge individuals to follow their dreams he said PERIOD We really believe the eight weeks is an impactful program for youths and provides applicable work experience. besides its not free or cheap to live eight weeks in Manhattan Normington said PERIOD

Normington said that  Georgetown students have participated in the University of Dreams so far PERIOD

eredith Gadoury MSB  one of the  said that her experience with University of Dreams in Barcelona was a good one PERIOD

I would definitely recommend it to other students especially if they dont want to go abroad for a semester and only want to intern for a short period of time she said PERIOD As far as a longterm serious internship during junior or senior year I would not really recommend it but as a sophomore or freshman year experience I would definitely recommend it as long as you are ready to study abroad PERIOD  PERIOD There were great training sessions fantastic weekends and a really nice community of people there. the organization provides financial aid services for students who cannot afford the full tuition according to its Web site PERIOD

The economic downturn has led to an increase in student interest in forprofit internship matching companies PERIOD According to the Wall Street Journal interest in these organizations has risen between  and  percent in the last year PERIOD

Other internship advising and placement companies such as Brill Street and Company and Fast Track Internships have also experienced growth in popularity PERIOD Brill Street which places students in paid positions and takes a cut of their paychecks receives almost  applications per week PERIOD

Normington said that the University of Dreams was experiencing a similar increase in applications PERIOD

Weve been running our program for nine years and this year is by far the highest enrollment numbers weve ever had Normington said PERIOD In this economy opportunities are hard to come by and we are a company that offers access to those opportunities. according to Normington the University of Dreams most commonly places students in finance and public relations internships PERIOD Positions in marketing event planning and the fashion industry are also very popular PERIOD

Whether students should pay for the experience at all particularly if they are placed in an unpaid position has become a question for college advisers nationwide PERIOD

ike Schaub executive director of the Career Education Center said students seeking internships have a wealth of support available on campus PERIOD

We have not endorsed anything like the University of Dreams Schaub said PERIOD We place internship opportunities on Hoya Career Connection so students can do a search for internships PERIOD We are also a member of the IRA Internship Network Consortium with eight other universities. others suggested that finding internships should not involve a third party arguing that students should be able to find unpaid positions without help PERIOD

The type of students corporate America wants are the students who can find their own internships Claudia Tattanelli chief executive officer of Universum USA told The Wall Street Journal PERIOD

Schaub agreed that internships are a valuable activity for Georgetown students to pursue if they can find the opportunity PERIOD

Whether in a good or in a bad economy work experience is very important to have under your belt Schaub said PERIOD
