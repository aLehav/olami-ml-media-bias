7218,2023-10-31,"the Muhlenberg womens field hockey team faced more than just pregame anxiety PERIOD On Saturday Oct PERIOD  the players faced Washington College at the home of the Mules PERIOD Unfortunately in Washingtons pursuit to get to Allentown Pa. they encountered enormous traffic PERIOD As a result the  p.m PERIOD game was delayed until  p.m PERIOD

Midfielder Devon Eastlack  commented on the game delay PERIOD The five hour delay definitely was a big factor affecting the team PERIOD One main focus was to keep everyones mind in the right mode and staying focused even in the uncertainty of whether the game was still going to happen that day PERIOD I think we did a great job of staying focused and keeping everyone accountable for doing so during the waiting period PERIOD I dont think the game delay affected the team in a negative way and we were all very happy with the outcome. the team persevered through the time delay and leaned on their family and friends for support PERIOD Mikayla DeMichele  commented We made sure to fuel up at the dining hall and I personally spent time with my family before heading to the locker room around  p.m. PERIOD The team definitely stayed focused and locked in for the game. in turn their energy and mindset going into the game was unwavering PERIOD

In the end the delay and cold weather did not affect the Mules in the slightest PERIOD Muhlenberg beat Washington College  adding a win to their record PERIOD Two of the goals were scored by Abba Diglio  and the last goal was scored by Zabelle Aslanian  in the fourth quarter PERIOD Eastlack gave praise to Diglio in stating She definitely stood out PERIOD Diglio had two of our goals and was the spark we needed. in addition Eastlack recognized other players hard work Diglio and Erin Disandro  are the leading point scorers in the conference Another recognizable player is Maddie Schwartz  PERIOD Shes really stepped up to become our starting goalie and has been improving with every game and practice recording two shutouts in the last three games. these individuals along with the teams combined effort pushed the girls to finish strong till the last whistle PERIOD

In the last few games of regular season play the team is focused on their conference performance PERIOD DeMichele said We are currently focusing on finishing out our last two conference games strong and leaving everything on the field PERIOD With that we are doing the best we can to make it into the playoffs but it all really depends on how the other teams perform as well PERIOD It honestly comes down to the very last day of conference play and the very last game PERIOD It is anyones game on any given day We have to be mentally and physically strong and channel our teamwork in order to find success

She continues about the teams energy for the rest of the season We are absolutely excited and ready to finish out the regular season with two more wins PERIOD I think we are more than capable and prepared to show everyone what exactly Berg Hockey is I have never seen more hard work discipline and dedication from a team It is very evident that the future of this team is bright and their spirit is positive in moving into the end of their regular season play PERIOD

Ultimately the Muhlenberg field hockey team translates all of their hard work from practice into game play PERIOD This game mentally and physically tested the players on Saturday and they successfully passed to win one of their last home games this season PERIOD
