Pitts club sports teams have set some high goals this season The roller hockey team wants to Pitts club sports teams have set some high goals this season The roller hockey team wants to go to nationals for the second consecutive year and the Division II mens ice hockey team is focused on winning its league PERIOD

Since returning to campus the teams leaders have focused on holding tryouts and finalizing their rosters looking to put together the right combination of returning players and newcomers to make the goals achievable PERIOD

Club sports teams compete with teams from other universities but their athletes arent on athletic scholarships and the teams arent governed by the NCAA PERIOD

While play has begun for some clubs  mens rugby competed in a tournament over Labor Day weekend  others are still preparing for the start of their seasons PERIOD

The Pitt News checked in with some of the teams on campus to see where club sports at Pitt stand early in the school year PERIOD

Ice Hockey

Dennis Wilson captain of the Division II mens ice hockey team said that his team will accept nothing less than winning the league this year after losing to Dayton in overtime of the TriState Collegiate Hockey League championship game last March PERIOD

Pitt only lost a few players to graduation and returns several seniors who have played together for three years PERIOD The team added nine new players through tryouts and two have experience playing collegiate club hockey PERIOD

Wilson said that a leaguefinals rematch with Dayton is likely as the opponent didnt lose many players to graduation either PERIOD

Roller Hockey

Despite his teams retaining just five players from last years squad  which made it to nationals  Ralph DeStefano sophomore and president of the roller hockey team said he feels confident that Pitt roller hockey can make a return trip this year PERIOD

The secondsemester return of two veteran players from study abroad will strengthen the teams chances PERIOD The season runs from October to the beginning of April PERIOD

Tryouts which concluded over the weekend brought players capable of contributing from the start and thats imperative given the small turnover the team experienced DeStefano said PERIOD

The squads goal is to make it back to Division II nationals where it finished in the top eight last year PERIOD

To accomplish this goal the team must win its league the Eastern Collegiate Roller Hockey Association or do well enough during the regular season to receive an atlarge bid  the route Pitt took last year PERIOD

Slippery Rock which finished second to Pitt in the Keystone Conference and also received an atlarge bid to nationals will likely challenge the Panthers in the division PERIOD

SUNY Binghamton might provide the biggest challenge for the Panthers at regionals which consists of the top eight teams from the Eastern Collegiate Roller Hockey Association PERIOD Pitt beat the Bearcats during the regular season last year but Binghamton eventually defeated the Panthers to win the region PERIOD

Pitt moved down to Division II two years ago PERIOD DeStefano said that division placement for teams is performancebased and if the Panthers do well in Division II again this year they could get bumped up to Division I PERIOD

Mens Rugby

The rugby team began its season by placing third in the Pound for Pound Collegiate Rugby Tournament over Labor Day weekend PERIOD

The team began Allegheny Rugby Union play on Sept PERIOD  with a  victory over Slippery Rock PERIOD

Benjamin Paul one of the squads veterans said he thinks the team has a very good chance of winning the league a feat that would assure the Panthers a spot in the Sweet  in the Midwest playoffs PERIOD

Paul said West Virginia which is leaving for Division I next year would compete with Pitt for the Allegheny Rugby Union Championship PERIOD

Womens Rugby

The womens rugby team continues its winning ways despite losing many players this season PERIOD

After going undefeated in the league a year ago the Pitt womens rugby team is  in its fall campaign PERIOD The Panthers dominated their opposition winning the past two games by a combined score of  PERIOD

The clubs goal in the spring is to repeat as Allegheny Rugby Union champions and go to regionals PERIOD

To win the league Pitt must first win its division and then the Allegheny Rugby Union playoffs PERIOD

League rivals Slippery Rock and Indiana University of Pennsylvania will pose a challenge to the Panthers repeat bid PERIOD

The team has lots of girls that have never played before secretary Kirsten Andrews said PERIOD

She added that the best way to learn the game and gain experience is by playing in games which the new players will be able to do by playing with the squads Bside PERIOD

Womens Ultimate

After graduating only four players from last years squad and starting the fall season off well the Pitt womens Ultimate team Danger has nationals in its sights PERIOD

In order to qualify for nationals Danger must first win sectionals a competition that consists of other Pennsylvania schools and then Ohio Valley Regionals PERIOD

Although the Ohio Valley didnt get any automatic bids last spring one team from the region could potentially secure an automatic bid PERIOD

Danger failed to qualify for nationals last year losing to Penn State  in the regional quarterfinals PERIOD The team is confident that the rebuilding phase is over and that they will find success this year team captain Bailey Moorhead said PERIOD

Although the fall season doesnt count for anything officially the tournaments are still important as players vie for spots in the rotation for the spring season PERIOD

Moorhead said that fringe players get ample playing time in these tournaments which allows captains to do thorough evaluations before they put the rotation together for the spring season PERIOD

The extra time provided by the fall season also helps the team members gain experience playing with one another PERIOD Coupled with practices at the Cost Sports Center between seasons the fall season eliminates the need for an adjustment period once games start back up in the spring Moorhead said PERIOD She said that it takes a semester to get the offense clicking PERIOD

The team has a viable shot at qualifying for nationals the captain said and two transfers with prior collegiate Ultimate experience will begin to contribute right away PERIOD

Ohio State last years regional champion and Penn State the other regional finalist will again provide challenges for the Danger. pERIOD

Mens Lacrosse

The mens lacrosse team made it to its conference championship last year losing to Michigan State in the semifinals  PERIOD This year Pitt hopes to get to the championship again PERIOD

But the road will be a bit different as the Central Collegiate Lacrosse Association now consists of a sixteam conference instead of two fourteam divisions PERIOD Michigan is now an NCAA Division I Program and Ball State left the association PERIOD

The Pitt team lost just three players to graduation and team president Brian Faber said the new players on the squad  a mix of transfers and freshmen  have the ability to contribute right away PERIOD

With Michigan out of the equation the team most likely to challenge the Panthers for the conference championship is Michigan State PERIOD

Faber said the teams goal is to qualify for the Mens Collegiate Lacrosse Association National Championship PERIOD

Winning the conference automatically qualifies the team but theres also the possibility of an atlarge bid PERIOD To prepare for the spring season the team faces a fivegame fall slate in addition to a tournament at West Virginia in October PERIOD
