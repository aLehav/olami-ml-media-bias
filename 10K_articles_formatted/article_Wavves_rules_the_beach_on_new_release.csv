Wavves frontman Nathan Williams is not sorry for partying  that much is clear PERIOD

King of the Beach  Green Label Sound



Williams has certainly had his share of press over the past year leading up to his bands sophomore release King of the Beach PERIOD The San Diegobred pizzaloving weed demonskate punk blew up the blogosphere with his own homegrown version of lofi noisepop experimentation often referred to as shitgaze on his first deliberately unpolished Wavves EP followed by his second album Wavvves PERIOD Then in rapid succession critical acclaim from media outlets such as Pitchfork followed by the infamous Primavera festival meltdown in which Williams took a reported drug cocktail of ecstasy and Valium before jeering the crowd and then if that werent enough prompting former Wavves drummer Ryan Ulsh to pour a beer on Williamss head before calling it quits for good  all of which led up to an inevitable Internet backlash PERIOD

After finding solace in the arms of Bethany Cosentino of Best Coast and smoking a bowl or fiftyhundred Williams managed to quickly regroup from the disaster finding new bandmates and signing with Mountain Dews Green Label Sound for King of the Beach a jaunty snotty overture to weed surf and sun PERIOD

King is definitely not Wavvves version threepointoh or Wavvvves as some had surmised it would be called PERIOD While Williamss first albums relied heavily on experimentation and haze King has a distinctive mostly fuzzfree sound that veers the Wavves project in a new direction PERIOD This time around Williamss voice is actually discernible and uncannily reminiscent of Blink 182s Tom DeLonge amidst the synth clutter PERIOD Hes distinctively less morose too PERIOD

If Wavvves represented Williams at his most despondent and withdrawn then King shows his sunnier extroverted side PERIOD Instead of lamenting the goth scene and his lack of future prospects like in previous records  Got no car got no money Williams takes on a more blatantly sarcastic tone even during his favorite oftmentioned topic of selfreproach PERIOD

On Green Eyes essentially a love ballad  in the style of Wavves anyway Williams claims that all of his friends hate his guts PERIOD Hes obviously kidding as the sentiment is accompanied by an extremely uptemp guitar riff and drum beats PERIOD Introspection is definitely not a key trait of Williams who seems to have a predilection for taking it easy via copious  references Garfield memorabilia et al PERIOD

This is not to say that everything about Wavves has changed PERIOD Williams impishness remains inherent throughout the record PERIOD The lead track PostAcid features his signature snide snarls PERIOD Hes just having fun with you though PERIOD No worries PERIOD Worrying is not something in Williamss vernacular anyhow PERIOD

Williams laissezfaire attitude has served him well  musically at least PERIOD And while his personal life has definitely had its ups and downs often documented in the lyrics of his songs they sure make for one hell of a summer album PERIOD
