WASHINGTON AP  The White House officials and the FBI clashed in a rare public quarrel Monday after President Clinton complained he should have been alerted about the agencys suspicions that the Chinese government might be trying to influence U.S PERIOD elections PERIOD
The president should know Clinton asserted PERIOD
However the FBI said it placed no restriction whatsoever about information going up the chain of command when it told two officials at the White House National Security Council staff last June that China might make illegal contributions to congressional campaigns PERIOD
But the White House officials insisted that the two officials clearly recall being urged not to disseminate the information outside the briefing room. therefore the White House considers the FBIs statement to be in error presidential spokesman Mike McCurry said leaving the FBI and the White House at an awkward impasse at days end PERIOD
The supposedly secret China briefing was the latest development in a series of White House embarrassments on the campaign fundraising front PERIOD Even though the allegations were of Chinese contributions aimed at congressional races Clinton and senior aides suggested they might have been more careful about accepting foreign donations from Asian sources had they known about the alleged Chinese scheme PERIOD
The president said that it would have provoked  a red flag on my part. the alleged withholding of information from Clinton seemed even stranger in the wake of revelations that the FBI gave classified briefings  to members of the NSC staff last year and to a member of Congress five years earlier  warning that China was trying to influence members of Congress with campaign contributions PERIOD
Before the FBI issued its statement Clinton complained that he should have been told about the agencys suspicions PERIOD It didnt happen PERIOD It should have happened PERIOD It was a mistake. however the FBI statement released Monday evening said
The FBI placed no restriction whatsoever on the dissemination up the chainofcommand at the NSC on any information provided to the NSC senior staff by the FBI during the June   briefing. it said senior officials of the bureaus national security division briefed two senior staff members of the NSC about the possible covert activities of a foreign government in the United States. one of the people receiving the briefing was an FBI agent detailed to the NSC PERIOD
Government sources identified the FBI detailee as Edward J PERIOD Appel and the other NSC staffer as Rand Beers PERIOD
Responding to the FBIs statement McCurry said the two NSC officials have been questioned by the White House legal counsel PERIOD
They are adamant in recalling specifically that they were urged not to disseminate the information outside the briefing room he said PERIOD
On Capitol Hill Rep PERIOD Nancy Pelosi DCalif. said FBI agents approached her in San Francisco in late  and early  with a caution that China is going to attempt to get funds into campaigns in the United States. pelosi said she heard nothing more about the issue until last June when the FBI again came to her with similar warnings PERIOD Democratic Sens PERIOD Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York said they also received FBI briefings last year PERIOD
McCurry asserted that the FBI instructed the national security officials to keep the information to themselves secret even from their White House bosses and the president himself PERIOD Im told thats not routine the White House spokesman said PERIOD
