Supreme Court Associate Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington D.C. on Wednesday Sept PERIOD   PERIOD Christy BoweGlobe PhotosZuma PressTNS

By  David G PERIOD Savage Jennifer Haberkorn  and Sarah D PERIOD Wire September  

WASHINGTON  Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Wednesday defended his broad view of gun rights and restrictions on abortion for young immigrant women but refused to say whether a president can be ordered to answer questions in a criminal investigation PERIOD

Facing senators during a second day of his confirmation hearing President Donald Trumps Supreme Court nominee proved adept at giving lengthy answers to questions without revealing his views on matters of controversy PERIOD

Youre learning to filibuster Sen PERIOD Dianne Feinstein DCalif. told him when he steered around her question on whether the president is shielded from being investigated or questioned while in office PERIOD

In law review articles in  and  Kavanaugh said the president should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office and should not be subject to investigations or questioning PERIOD The Constitution seems to dictate that Congress not a special prosecutor should investigate a president for lawbreaking he wrote PERIOD

But when pressed repeatedly by Democrats on Wednesday Kavanaugh contended that he has never taken a position on whether indicting or investigating a president for criminal wrongdoing is constitutional PERIOD

The issue has taken on new significance because Trump is caught up in special counsel Robert S PERIOD Mueller IIIs investigation of Russian interference in the  election and could be called to answer questions from a grand jury PERIOD

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E PERIOD Grassley RIowa joining other Republicans in trying to help the nominee articulate his views asked Kavanaugh whether you have any trouble ruling against a president who appointed you. youre correct PERIOD No one is above the law in our constitutional system Kavanaugh said who answered senators questions beginning at  a.m PERIOD until well into the evening PERIOD The executive branch is subject to the law subject to the court system. but when Feinstein asked Can a sitting a president be required to respond to a subpoena Kavanaugh would not answer PERIOD Thats a hypothetical question he said PERIOD I cant give you an answer to a hypothetical question. he did however endorse as correct the Supreme Courts  ruling in United States vs PERIOD Nixon which required President Richard Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes PERIOD It was one of the greatest moments in American judicial history he said PERIOD

But he refused to give a similar endorsement for the  ruling in Roe vs PERIOD Wade which established a womans right to abortion PERIOD Feinstein tried to get him to say whether the ruling was correct and Kavanaugh said only that it was entitled to respect as a precedent PERIOD

Most legal experts predict that Kavanaugh if confirmed will provide the fifth conservative vote on the court to restrict abortion rights or overturn Roe PERIOD During his campaign Trump promised to appoint only judges who would vote to overturn the abortion ruling PERIOD

But Kavanaugh seemed eager to raise some doubts PERIOD I understand the significance on the issue he said Wednesday PERIOD I dont live in a bubble PERIOD I live in the real world. kavanaugh noted several times that the  decision had been repeatedly affirmed and that a  ruling in Planned Parenthood vs PERIOD Casey which affirmed much of Roe in effect created a precedent on precedent. and he made an analogy to the late Chief Justice William H PERIOD Rehnquists decision not to overturn the socalled Miranda rights disclosure requirement for criminal suspects PERIOD Rehnquist had long opposed the Miranda ruling but then decided it was too late to overturn it PERIOD Its also true however that Rehnquist found ways to narrow the rulings impact PERIOD

Kavanaughs remarks about Roe may have been largely directed at two female Republican senators who support abortion rights and whose votes will be key to Kavanaughs confirmation PERIOD Sens PERIOD Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have not announced how they will vote PERIOD

But Kavanaugh gave no assurances about how he might vote and nothing he said would prevent him from voting to restrict abortion rights on the court PERIOD Many Supreme Court nominees speak about the importance of respecting precedents and then once on the court vote to overturn them PERIOD

Feinstein for now seem unsatisfied PERIOD We cant accept vague promises from Brett Kavanaugh when womens reproductive freedom is at stake she said on Twitter PERIOD

Last fall Kavanaugh was involved in a dispute over whether a migrant teenager in Texas could be released from immigration custody to obtain an abortion PERIOD A federal judge cleared the way but Kavanaugh wrote a  decision siding with Trump administration lawyers and blocking the abortion for up to  more days PERIOD The full appeals court intervened and overturned his ruling PERIOD In dissent he faulted his more liberal colleagues as wrongly creating a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S PERIOD government detention to obtain abortion on demand. he defended that ruling Wednesday stressing that the girl was  and not yet an adult PERIOD If she had been an adult she would have had a right to obtain an abortion immediately he told Sen PERIOD Richard J PERIOD Durbin RIll PERIOD

Durbin rejected the distinction noting that the teenager had appeared before a state judge in Texas who decided she was sufficiently mature to make the decision on her own PERIOD

On guns Kavanaugh stuck fast to his support of a broad Second Amendment right to possess a semiautomatic rifle with a large magazine of ammunition PERIOD

He dissented alone in  when the U.S PERIOD Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld a D.C PERIOD ordinance that prohibited semiautomatic assault weapons. three years before the Supreme Court in District of Columbia vs PERIOD Heller struck down a law prohibiting possession of a handgun at home and established a Second Amendment individual right for gun ownership PERIOD

Feinstein asked why Kavanaugh believed semiautomatic weapons could not be banned when appellate judges across the country had upheld such restrictions PERIOD

I had to follow precedent Kavanaugh replied PERIOD He said former Justice Antonin Scalia said the Second Amendment did not protect weapons that are dangerous and unusual and semiautomatic rifles are not unusual he said PERIOD They are widely possessed by millions of gun owners he said PERIOD

Kavanaugh did not back off even when Feinstein spoke about the wave of mass shootings at schools using assault weapons PERIOD

On the question of presidential power Kavanaugh said that no one is above the law as one would expect any nominee to say PERIOD

But he declined to answer questions about whether Trump could pardon himself or pardon someone in exchange for an agreement not to testify against him saying those were hypothetical questions that he couldnt answer without potentially prejudging issues that might come before the courts PERIOD

Sen PERIOD Patrick J PERIOD Leahy DVt. confronted the nominee with what he said was evidence that a Republican staff member during George W PERIOD Bushs administration had supplied Kavanaugh  who was then helping to confirm judges  with information that had been stolen from Democratic files PERIOD Leahy said the information detailed what the senator planned to ask nominees during confirmation hearings PERIOD

Leahy whose emails were stolen quizzed Kavanaugh on whether he knowingly used the stolen documents noting that Kavanaugh was included in an email chain discussing the information PERIOD Kavanaugh said he did not recall PERIOD I dont really have a specific recollection of any of this he told lawmakers PERIOD Kavanaugh seemed unprepared for the questions and somewhat flustered PERIOD

Leahy said later Wednesday that Grassley agreed to release documents related to the stolen materials which are now confined only to lawmakers on the committee PERIOD

Grassleys office didnt make the same pledge PERIOD Spokesman Taylor Foy said Grassley would do his best to accommodate this lastminute request adding that waiving the classification would require input from the White House and former President Bush PERIOD
