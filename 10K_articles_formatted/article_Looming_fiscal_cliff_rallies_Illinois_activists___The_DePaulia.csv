As the federal government inches closer to the fiscal cliff  the potential end of many tax breaks and cuts for businesses Dec PERIOD   many Illinois organizations are trying to make their voices heard amidst the negotiations PERIOD

As part of the Make Wall Street Pay Illinois initiative the IllinoisIndiana Regional Organizing Network IIRON spoke out against Durbins role in the federal governments attempts to negotiate a deal before it reaches the fiscal cliff next month PERIOD

According to Elizabeth Scrafford a DePaul student and IIRON participant the Democratic whip has stated that he is willing to cut funding for programs like Medicare and Social Security to achieve a balanced budget PERIOD Scrafford believes this method is a threat to the countrys wellbeing PERIOD

The sort of budget hes pushing toward is not for the people said Scrafford PERIOD If the cuts go through then the cuts will cost lives. to respond to this policy Make Wall Street Pay Illinois and its sister organizations built a makeshift shantytown in Federal Plaza where Durbins Chicago office is located PERIOD Demonstrators spread tents around the plaza and a group entered the federal building to build one in its lobby PERIOD That group was immediately arrested according to Scrafford PERIOD

Scrafford said they succeeded in spreading the word that day PERIOD Several people witnessed what they were doing and they received some media attention PERIOD

There are a lot of people in Chicago and across the U.S PERIOD that will suffer greatly if the social safety net is cut so the senator has a lot of support to get behind a peoples budget she said PERIOD

Previous to Thursdays action they hosted a soup and bread line at Federal Plaza to dramatize the reality of the budget cuts. scrafford and others believe that if programs like Social Security are cut then the country could fall into a recession PERIOD

Its good for a few people but not for everyone she said PERIOD

Ultimately Scrafford wants to see Durbin produce a fair deal and reign in support from the rest of the party PERIOD She said the fiscal deadline pushes people to demand a solution as soon as possible but this mindset fails to consider the human element of the governments actions PERIOD

After Thursday however one of their primary goals has been achieved PERIOD The last few months have been a long ongoing conversation Scrafford said but now they have Durbins attention PERIOD

Now we just need him to do his job and use his power to push forward a peoples budget. the Student News Site of DePaul University",Looming fiscal cliff rallies Illinois activists - The DePaulia,DePaul University
