Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Joelle McGinnisJanuary  

By this time of the year even the most wellintended of resolutions made for the new year have become just thatwell intended PERIOD

Now come on you can admit it PERIOD It does seem to be the perfect time to put the past behind and break forth into the New Year with a fresh start doesnt it

A little time off to enjoy the holiday season and everyone is rested and ready jump back into the same old patterns that life has designed for us with newfound determination and outlook PERIOD

But around about the third week into the month the time becomes right for New Years Resolutions to become passe PERIOD Think about it PERIOD

The week before the Big Day the only question to start off any meaningless conversation with is  Have you made your New Years resolutions yet After this suggestions are exchanged between the resolutionmakerstobe with the best of intentions and then later with resolve the promises are proclaimed for all to hear PERIOD

Declarations of committments claiming that This is going to be The year that the resolution will be kept are expounded as the first week of the New Year begins PERIOD

And overall the majority of resolution makers are fairly dedicated to sticking to their words PERIOD The few slips here and there are easily remedied with a gentle reminder from fellow resolution makers PERIOD

Then comes the moment in time when the true resolution makers are separated from the seasonal or trendy types PERIOD The second week of the month is truly the makeit or breakit week PERIOD

It is the week during which it becomes easier and easier to say  Well just this one time wont do any harm next time will be different

So by the time week three rolls around most resolutions are a thing of the past dismissed as ridiculous and forgotten PERIOD

But making a resolution and sticking to it is not that bad of an idea when you sit back and think about it PERIOD Especially for those around the university who are looking to break away from past problems and come up with solutions PERIOD

Maybe something as simple as a new years resolution made by some of NIUs administrators could at the very least do some good PERIOD What could it hurt

ow about a resolution as simple as getting out of the office in Lowden Hall at least once a week for oh say an hour or so and checking out what does go on around campus PERIOD What better way could be found to keep in touch with the goingson

Spending hour after hour sitting in meetings and listening to reports on the state of NIU is not the way to keep a finger on the pulse of the university PERIOD

Stories are told of Leslie A PERIOD Holmes a former NIU president who made a habit of such a practice PERIOD The university could expect the unexpected with this president PERIOD

Holmes was known to drop in on a class lecture or two just to see what was going on in the universitys classrooms PERIOD

Or he might take a walk through one of the numerous offices on campus and stop to chat with workers to see how their jobs were going PERIOD

And once during a stroll through what is now known as the Holmes Student Center he began a conversation with a student who as most students probably would be was unaware of whom he was speaking with PERIOD In the end introductions were exchanged and an invitation to dinner was offered to the student and a friend of his choice PERIOD

Now granted for anyone on the NIU campus to receive an invitation to dine at President John LaTourettes house for dinner or to drive around the block in Provost Kendall Bakers red porsche is a bit out of the ordinary but administrators might learn a new thing or two by getting out and mingling PERIOD

A conversation struck up while trotting around the track with Jon Dalton vice president of student affairs or even while sipping sodas in the Pow Wow with the president might offer a new look at some things PERIOD

In fact the views seen could turn out to be very different from that of an office window PERIOD
