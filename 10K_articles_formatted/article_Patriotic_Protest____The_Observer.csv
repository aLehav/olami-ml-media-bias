Letter to the Editor  Monday March  

As a senior leader in Army ROTC who faces the likely prospect of being sent to Iraq in the next year or two I found the discussion about last weeks protest interesting PERIOD I would like to offer my two cents and thank those who started and continued what I found to be a thoughtful and welltimed protest PERIOD

What are you supporting by supporting the war The Army does not declare war Congress does PERIOD A soldier takes no part in deciding whether or not to go to war a soldier goes to war when he or she is told to by the government PERIOD

Since we are fortunate enough to be governed by a democracy the people are essentially the ones who decide to go to war and our support of the war means supporting the cause and the deployment of troops to realize that cause PERIOD If you do not support the war you are simply opposing a government decision and the best way to support the troops in that case is to discourage the government from sending troops into harms way in a thoughtful manner of course PERIOD

A soldiers mission is to support and defend the people of the United States and its Constitution to support a soldier is to support this mission not necessarily a particular war PERIOD Patriotism does not mean blindly following the dictates of the present administration it means encouraging the course of action which is best for our nation and the whole world PERIOD

The recent protest by provoking thought and discussion about that best course of action was an act of patriotism PERIOD
