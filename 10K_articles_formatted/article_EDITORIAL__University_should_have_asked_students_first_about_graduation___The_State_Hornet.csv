State HornetNovember  

Well Sac State youve done it again PERIOD

Once again our campus is going through a major change and students are the ones who are suffering the consequences without ever having a say in the matter PERIOD

The recent announcement that winter commencement ceremonies will cease after this Decembers wasnt a decision that was made overnight PERIOD This is something thats been in the works for a while now PERIOD

RELATED Citing money concerns Sac State pulls plug on winter commencements

It was determined that only one commencement per year is needed because of how expensive it has been and they would continue to be held in the new location Sacramentos prized piglet known as the Golden  Center PERIOD

The other possible solution to this problem was to increase the cost of commencement fees for students PERIOD It is unendingly infuriating how many nickels and dimes students are asked to fork over nevermind our overpriced caps and gowns PERIOD

Perhaps it is to be expected that Sac State students like most others countrywide be asked to pay for our own collective celebration along with everything else we pay for PERIOD Another loan could probably take care of it after all PERIOD

But barring a comprehensive reform to higher education in America fingers and toes crossed students will be given the bill over and over again PERIOD So what could have been done better this time

Sac State had a golden opportunity to allow students to chime in on an issue that really matters to them and they didnt take advantage of it PERIOD So instead of issuing a schoolwide vote or at the very least informing us and asking for feedback some of us will have no choice but to miss out on graduation PERIOD

RELATED Ceasing winter commencements a loselose for students

There was a similar situation as well as a chance to avoid this altogether when Destination  was initially proposed PERIOD Back in  when the idea of a community event center was first conceived students were allowed to vote on whether or not they approved of a fee increase that would be associated with building the new structure as well as other campus improvements PERIOD

Fastforward to  all that came of that vote is The WELL a health and fitness center that delivers on only half of the vague promises that were made by the Destination  initiative PERIOD

So with no oncampus option for the likely  or so eligible graduates for the next academic year students should be prepared for a squeeze on tickets longer ceremonies and unhappy families PERIOD

The University should prepare for disappointed students who will leave with a degree in the fall and never celebrate with their class only further emphasizing the overwhelming feeling that were at the academic equivalent of a Costco PERIOD Except it takes four or more years to get through the checkout line and there was never a free sample PERIOD

So next time ask students what they think before making such a big leap PERIOD Get some feedback and take the backlash on the chin before you make the decision PERIOD Actually apologize for the inconvenience and disappointment and recognize that without the students there would be no Sac State PERIOD

Moreover admit its a money problem PERIOD What President Robert Nelsens letter failed to address is that the one thing most people Sac State students in particular can understand and empathize with is not having enough money to do what you want PERIOD

Your donation will support the student journalists of Sacramento State University PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
