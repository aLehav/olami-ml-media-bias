Utes have the players and stats to back up top10 ranking

By Brock Jensen

For the last few weeks Utah has been ranked among the top  teams in college basketball yet the question is still being asked whether or not the Utes really deserve their current place in the polls PERIOD

Sure Utah has been down in the last few years but under head coach Larry Krystkowiak the Utes have not just rebounded from multiple forgettable seasons but are also close to returning to a form not seen since the glory days of Andre Miller and Rick Majerus PERIOD Simply enough the Utes are indeed deserving of their ranking PERIOD

The Runnin Utes are entering the second half of their schedule with a record of  overall and  in conference play PERIOD Their only losses have been to thenNo PERIOD  San Diego State in San Diego and thenNo PERIOD  Kansas in Kansas City PERIOD Those arent the worst losses in the world to have on the Utes rsum PERIOD

The rest of Utahs body of work speaks for itself PERIOD It features blowouts winning streaks and most notably an overtime win over thenNo PERIOD  Wichita State PERIOD

Even without that victory the Utes top10 ranking would be justified and thats because of how Utah has played defense this season PERIOD The Utes defense ranks eighth in the NCAA in points allowed per game with opposing teams averaging just . points PERIOD And the defense has only gotten better since entering conference play PERIOD

In Utahs first three Pac12 games they held USC UCLA and Colorado to   and  points respectively  quite a statement to the rest of the conference PERIOD

The UCLA game is a perfect example of what this team can do defensively PERIOD Utah held UCLA to 29percent shooting and their lowest point total since   just a little bit impressive PERIOD

The Utes are also dominating the glass outrebounding all but two opponents this season PERIOD A team that plays defense and rebounds is a team that is built to go deep into March PERIOD So Ute fans start dreaming of a Final Four PERIOD Its really not that crazy PERIOD

But the Utes arent just playing well on the defensive end PERIOD

Since the return of Jordan Loveridge from a minor inseason knee surgery Utahs offense has started firing on all cylinders PERIOD

Utah has been shooting the ball a tick above 50percent on the season  good enough for eighth in the nation PERIOD The Utes are getting high percentage shots and knocking them down PERIOD

Utah is wellbalanced and with Loveridge Brandon Taylor and Brekkott Chapman hitting from the outside theyve opened up driving lanes and space down low for the Utes big men to go to work PERIOD Having some quality bigs who are able to finish down low doesnt hurt either PERIOD

Oh and I havent even mentioned Utahs best and most important player Delon Wright PERIOD

Wright has been the key to everything the Utes are doing this season PERIOD Hes averaging just under  points . assists . rebounds and . steals so far and has cemented himself as one of the nations best players PERIOD If Wright continues to play like this and theres is no reason to think he wont the Utes can start thinking about a Pac12 Championship and beyond PERIOD

Though the Utes may not have been tested as much as some of the other top  teams the wins and the statistics are there to back up their ranking PERIOD They have an elite player an elite defense and a balanced squad PERIOD A special season is in the works PERIOD

Runnin Utes ranking is thanksto an easy schedule

By Kim Brenneisen

Im just going to come out and say it  the Utes are no top10 team PERIOD In fact they are on the edge of being kicked out of their spot depending on how they play this week against the Arizona schools PERIOD

Yes Utah is currently ranked eighth in the AP Poll and coaches also have them in the same spot in the USA Today Coaches Poll but its schedule really hasnt been all that hard PERIOD Against the few tough opponents they have faced  San Diego State Kansas and Wichita State  the Utes have struggled with their only win coming against the Shockers PERIOD

And lets face it Wichita State is not having as great of a season as it did a year ago not to mention the Shockers are playing in a weak conference where they are hardly challenged PERIOD Instead they face inferior opponents and it appears as though the Utes are one of only a few ranked teams they will face all season long PERIOD

All of this diminishes the Utes socalled great win into simply another victory PERIOD Wichita State has a reputable college basketball program but this year is clearly not its best PERIOD

With the big game against the Arizona Wildcats coming up this weekend I predict that Utah will lose at least one of their two games against Arizona this season PERIOD The Wildcats are currently undefeated at home and hardly ever take a loss in front of their home crowd PERIOD It will be no different this coming Saturday when the Utes are in town PERIOD

In addition to the Wildcats having homecourt advantage they have defeated all of their ranked opponents PERIOD If for some reason Utah pulls out the win on the road Arizona will surely take the next game away from them in the Huntsman Center PERIOD

The Utes have won  games pretty easily but with only one notable win against currently 13thranked Wichita State they have not yet faced off against any noteworthy talent PERIOD

They did have a decent road win against the team down south. but really BYU The Cougars play in the weaker West Coast Conference save Gonzaga and have dropped games against Purdue and Pepperdine  hardly the rsum of a top team PERIOD

And all the teams the Utes have beaten except Wichita State and Carroll College have at least five losses halfway through the season so no real accomplishments there PERIOD

They still have half of their season left to play all conference play until the postseason PERIOD The Pac12 isnt very strong in mens basketball this season PERIOD The only two ranked teams in the conference are the Utes and the Wildcats while a majority of the other teams have been struggling up to this point PERIOD

Aside from looking at the Utes alone it is important to recognize that there are other teams who are better than them PERIOD There is no arguing against the two undefeated teams Kentucky and Virginia PERIOD After those teams claim the top spots there should be no arguing against the teams with only one loss such as Duke Gonzaga and Villanova PERIOD Those five teams are all better than Utah PERIOD

Throw in other twoloss teams like Louisville Wisconsin Arizona Notre Dame and Kansas who has beaten Utah yet is ranked behind the Utes and there are  teams better than the Utes PERIOD The reason I place these twoloss teams ahead of Utah is that all of them besides Arizona play in stronger conferences PERIOD

The Utes by all means deserve to be ranked but despite having a much better season than in years past they do not belong in the top  PERIOD When its all said and done they will be ranked appropriately on the outside looking in at the  best teams in America PERIOD
