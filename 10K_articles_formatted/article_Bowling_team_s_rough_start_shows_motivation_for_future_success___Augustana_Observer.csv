The Womens bowling team began their first season ever during late October with only six teammembers PERIOD The bowlers competed in their fifth tournament of the season this past weekend at the Warhawk Open in Addison IL ranking twenty-fourth out of  teams PERIOD Despite the loss several members had personal bests at thetournament PERIOD Freshman Taylor Kies placed in fortieth out of  competitors PERIOD Freshman Alex Buffington and Sophomore Kasia Mucha were not far behind placing in forty-fifth and forty-eighth respectively PERIOD
The team has only had five competitions in total all of which landed them in low ranks amongst other teams PERIOD Even with the losses in previous competitions A positive attitude is a keyto making the season fun and successful Mucha said PERIOD
From the previous tournaments weve had to keep our spirits up and push through to the end which is something I and probably the rest of the team have found to be the key to our success PERIOD Bowling for  hours straight is exhausting and to get up and do it again the next morning isnt always easy so as long as we are keeping a positive attitude Ive noticed we tend to do pretty well Mucha said PERIOD
Being a new team on campus without previous experiences to follow has its challenges but benefits as well PERIOD Firstyearbowler Ariel GonsowskiPadron also has a positive outlook about being a new team on campus and hopes for future improvements PERIOD
The most exciting thing about being the first bowling team on campus is that we can set our own records PERIOD We all love to joke around whenever we say We just bowled the highest series in Augustana history after we have bowled high PERIOD Its pretty cool being a new team because no one has any expectations for us PERIOD We dont have any weight on our shoulders when we walk into a tournamentPadron said PERIOD
The team has a large gap between their next tournament which is the Eagle Baker Challenge on January . padron and Mucha stated their hopes for the rest of the season PERIOD
My goalis mainly just to improve my average PERIOD Another important goal I have for myself is to become a better teammate PERIOD If others see how close of a team we are theyll be more interested in joining usPadron said PERIOD
Mucha agreed with Padron PERIOD
Looking forward Im hoping we just keep beating our records and making more headlines we have to show people we are the real deal now dont we Being a new team is nice because we are setting the foundation for future seasons and personally I believe we are setting a solid one and having fun doing it Mucha said PERIOD
