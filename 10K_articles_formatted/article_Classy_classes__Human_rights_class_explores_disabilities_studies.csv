5296,2017-11-15,"when J.S.D PERIOD candidate Doron Dorfman J.S.M PERIOD  arrived at Stanford five years ago he was shocked to find that not a single person at the university identified as a disabilities scholar PERIOD This fall Dorfman introduced a new course called HUMRTS  Introduction to Disability Studies and Disability Rights to fill the gap PERIOD

Stanford needs academic engagement with disability studies Dorfman said PERIOD I really want to show that disability studies is an academic field. originally from Israel Dorfman has been doing work on the intersection between disability studies and law for over a decade.He practiced law in Israel for five years before coming to the U.S PERIOD

The course combines the humanities social science and legal spheres PERIOD Throughout the quarter studentsstudydisability history in the U.S. the eugenics movement psychological processes of creating disability identity media representation of disability and international law relating to disability PERIOD

Thecontent of the course includesa wide range of disabilities such as mental physical and sensory disabilities as well as chronic illnesses PERIOD Dorfman explained that the distinction between impairment and disability is similar to the distinction between sex and gender in gender studies PERIOD

Impairment is the physical biological pathological part of the disability and the disability is the social construction part its how people perceive you because of your impairment said Dorfman PERIOD Because we look at disability as a cultural issue as a social issue and as a political issue we can look at different impairments and talk about all of them in a coherent way. brickelle Bro  one of  students enrolled in the class echoed this belief PERIOD Bro herself has both legs amputated below the knee PERIOD

I think its important for everyone to take this class because you understand first of all how allencompassing disability is secondly its important to make a world where disability is acceptable because theres literally no downside said Bro PERIOD I think its important to change the attitude around disability so we can hopefully get to that point where disability is acceptable. earlier in the quarter Dorfman assigned a reading in which a disability scholar used the word crip. the derogatory term short for cripple has recently been reclaimed by members of the disability community PERIOD

I got some pushback from the students who didnt love the use of the term and were not used to it Dorfman said PERIOD I was surprised that there was some reluctance to acknowledge it. dorfman discovered many students had never been exposed to the term explaining their initial discomfort PERIOD Through this experience Dorfman said he learned not to take advantage of the reclamation of derogatory words PERIOD

I think that doing disability studies as a nondisabled person is a humbling process because you really need to think very closely about what you say and how you say it and who you represent and how you represent them Dorfman said PERIOD

Dorfman believes that it is important to bring the voices of disabled communities into the course PERIOD Last week the class went on a field trip to the Ed Roberts Campus in Berkeley PERIOD Ed Roberts was a quadriplegic student at UC Berkeley and a pioneer in the Independent Living Movement in the 1960s PERIOD Dorfmans students had the opportunity to speak with activists living with disabilities PERIOD

We heard from a lot of notable people in the field which was awesome because it was people whose papers we had read Ariel Yu  said PERIOD

Disability studies is really a window to learn about society and culture Dorfman said PERIOD Looking at the world through a disability prism teaches us about topics like what makes someone human what qualities are valued in certain cultures how to define productivity who gets to be a parent or a lawyer or an athlete  Disability studies is everybody studies. contact Olivia Mitchel at omitchel at stanford.edu PERIOD
