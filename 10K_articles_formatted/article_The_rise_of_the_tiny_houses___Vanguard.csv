Articles about them show up in my Facebook feed pretty regularly PERIOD There have been news segments on them and at this point tiny houses are probably  percent of the content on Pinterest PERIOD People like tiny houses because theyre touted as sustainable as being a solution to the housing crisis in big cities and theres definitely an element of getting back to our roots about it PERIOD But as much as people love the idea I cant get behind the movement PERIOD

I grew up in Albany a smaller town in Oregon and Ive always been used to having space PERIOD It was an older house that my parents bought and refurbished after they got married with two bedrooms and a big yard PERIOD Maybe its my own bias but when I read stories about people with children buying a tiny house I feel bad for the kids PERIOD Having my own room as a kid was great PERIOD I had my own personal space and I had a place to keep all of my things PERIOD

But beyond reasons of privacy and personal space I think tiny houses are kind of a pipe dream PERIOD Theyre like the American Dream of owning a house and land as seen through an Instagram filter PERIOD Attached to this dream is the idea of building your house on a small plot of land but of course this plot of land will still be within driving or biking distance of cities PERIOD

They dont help with affordability either PERIOD Forbes estimates the average cost of a tiny house to be  per square foot but according to the last census the average cost of a regular house is  per square foot PERIOD This doesnt include land either PERIOD

I cant help but notice that a lot of the people who have these dreams are millennials PERIOD The entire tiny house movement seems to be a way for millennials to feel content with having way less than our parents and grandparents did PERIOD Living in a tiny house with a plot of land feels like trying to do mental gymnastics PERIOD Its one thing to want the tiny house but most people still want the space that a plot of land comeswith PERIOD

Economists have been projecting for a long time that were going to be the first generation with less wealth than our parents PERIOD Ive always wanted to end up with a house large enough for a family and with enough space that I can take care of my parents when theyre older PERIOD Sustainability is one thing but there are so many ways to be sustainable without massively downsizing PERIOD I dont really like the idea of convincing people to be content with less or with living small in this context PERIOD

It feels like convincing people they need to be happy being poorer and living with less than every generation before them PERIOD f the content on Pinterest PERIOD People like tiny houses because theyre touted as sustainable as being a solution to the housing crisis in big cities and theres definitely an element of getting back to our roots about it PERIOD But as much as people love the idea I cant get behind the movement PERIOD
