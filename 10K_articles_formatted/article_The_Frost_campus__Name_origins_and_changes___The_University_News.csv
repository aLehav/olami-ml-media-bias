3641,2018-10-10,"while registering for classes in Banner talking to an old professor or looking at an old map one may encounter references to the Frost Campus PERIOD The name is symbolic for something that the university would like to move on from and that is why it is less and less referred to as the Frost Campus and now often as the North Campus. the origin of the Frost Campus name is intertwined with the stories of the American Civil War PERIOD In  the area that currently makes up the engineering school and Busch Student Center was called Lindells Grove PERIOD

At the time the wooded area was home to Camp Jackson a civil war camp named after the newly elected prosecession governor PERIOD General Daniel M PERIOD Frost was a strong proponent of Governor Jackson PERIOD Frost lead the Missouri Minutemen a secessionist paramilitary organization PERIOD

Frost operated overtly as the Missouri Volunteer Militia despite Missouris neutrality policy PERIOD Frost also secretly conspired with Governor Jackson to plan an attack on the Federal Arsenal in downtown St PERIOD Louis PERIOD Two Minutemen sought out artillery which Confederate President Davis agreed to supply PERIOD Union Captain Nathaniel Lyon intercepted the plans and planned an arrest PERIOD

On May   the Missouri Volunteer Militia was arrested for receiving a secret shipment of weaponry artillery and ammunitions from the Confederate government PERIOD

The militia was not resistant however and local citizens rioted at the news PERIOD A total of  died as a result PERIOD Another  were wounded PERIOD

The riot sparked the beginning of a conflict that would eventually expel Governor Jackson PERIOD After the Camp Jackson incident Frost was paroled and joined the Confederates in the South as a major general and then as an inspector general PERIOD He abruptly left the Confederates and joined his family in Canada who had been forced out of St PERIOD Louis for their Confederate sympathies PERIOD

After the war Frost eventually moved back to St PERIOD Louis PERIOD He wrote a significant amount about his time in the war contradictorily suggesting that he had never plotted against the Union but also that he had never abandoned the Confederate army PERIOD

In  after the war the university purchased Lindells Grove PERIOD In  Harriet Frost Fordyce daughter of Gen PERIOD Frost donated one million dollars to the university allowing the university to purchase  acres of land east of Grand Boulevard PERIOD Per her request the campus was named in honor of her father PERIOD The area that once was home to Camp Jackson was ironically included in the new Frost Campus PERIOD

Although it has not been officially expressed the administration quietly changed the name of the Frost Campus in recent years PERIOD A professor in the sociology department removed all references to the Frost Campus in his guides and rubrics but the name came up in conversation nonetheless PERIOD Banner still refers to the main campus as Frost Campus in all of its catalog PERIOD

It is important to remember that behind every name is a story PERIOD It just so happened that the name of Saint Louis Universitys main campus came from a stanch Confederate PERIOD Thus the Frost campus is now known as the North campus PERIOD

Fine SLU should give the Frost family back their blood money PERIOD  This is not about special snowflakes being upset PERIOD  This is about our country finally rejecting the dangerous and morally appalling Lost Cause propaganda PERIOD

Least we forget the Confederacy seceded from the Union because they wanted to keep owning slaves PERIOD  Why do we as a nation still have such a hard time accepting this fact  The Confederacy was not some heoric and just band of good ol boys PERIOD  Read Alexander Stephens Cornerstone Speech from  PERIOD  Stephens the VP of the Confederacy expressly stated that the cornerstone of the Confederacy was the truth that the negro is not equal to the white man. the leaders of the Confederacy in their own words repeatedly and explicitly explained that the war was about their desire to maintain slavery PERIOD

Like Germany prohibited the swastika after the Holocaust some past events were so terrible that some restrictions upon freedom of expression should be enacted PERIOD  It is not whitewashing history or rewriting it PERIOD  It is a cultural acknowledgement of a major social wrong that we as a people want to repudiate in the hopes that it wont happen again PERIOD

If you want to put up a sign that explains the old campus name fine PERIOD  I for one definitely do not want to lose the history of the attrocity of slavery and the Civil War PERIOD  It is a critical lesson that we need to remember PERIOD  But SLU should not continue to celebrate and honor a traitor who left the Union to support the ownership and torture of humans by naming their campus after him PERIOD   We should not forget Frost but we dont have to glorify him PERIOD  There is a critical difference between REMEMBERING and HONORING PERIOD

Ultimately names change all the time PERIOD  Its our insidious and systemic racism that makes something so obviously right removing the Frost name the subject of a rancorous and vitriolic debate PERIOD

Has the university returned the million dollars to the Frost family plus interest This is what happened when Vanderbilt University wanted to remove the name of a campus building named Confederate Memorial Hall. a lawsuit was filed and Vanderbilt paid the United Daughters of the Confederacy . million which was the compounded value of the amount the UDC donated to the university when the building was constructed in the early 1900s PERIOD

History done spare and empty PERIOD  Imagine your local National Guard unit which meets every year is suddenly surrounded by the one hundred and first Airborne and compelled to surrender at gunpoint PERIOD  Imagine the Airbornes orders are all shouted in German PERIOD  Imagine the Airborne firing in volleys into the unruly crowd killing women and children  one baby dead in its mothers arms PERIOD Imagine William Tecumseh Sherman lying in a ditch protecting his sons body with his cloak from Airborne volleys PERIOD  Imagine the Airborne commander Nathaniel Lyon at a peace conference weeks later saying he would see you you and you pointing around the room and every man woman and child in Missouri dead and buried. now let your campus Taliban amend names and events and let your tales promote the comfy current political orthodoxy PERIOD",The Frost campus: Name origins and changes â€“ The University News,St. Louis University
