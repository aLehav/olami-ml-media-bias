Iwas incredibly excited to get accepted to Augsburg when I was a senior in high school PERIOD I felt like I had made it PERIOD I had finally achieved the goal Id had since I was five PERIOD My mother and family were all ecstatic as I was the first one in my family to go to college PERIOD I had visions of drinking coffee with my laptop open at coffee shops and fun weekends with friends PERIOD

While these visions did come true and my first month of Augsburg was amazing I failed to envision what it would be like to walk an unknown path with little support PERIOD I was comfortable with the academic setting but I had the strange idea that I had to be perfect to make it in this environment any imperfection would end my college career and send me back to where I started PERIOD When I got a low score on a paper I began to have feelings of selfdoubt Did I belong here Did I get in by mistake A low score on one assignment may not have been devastating to most people but to me it meant that I was not perfect PERIOD Clearly I was overreacting but I faced the enormous pressure of being the first in my family to go to college PERIOD

After gaining my composure three days later I decided to go back to my therapist PERIOD It was another two months until I could get back in with her but when I did and explained my situation she introduced me to imposter syndrome PERIOD Imposter syndrome is defined by the Harvard Business Review as Feelings of inadequacy that persist despite evidence of success which was exactly what I had been feeling PERIOD

It is important for all of us especially firstgeneration college students to not weigh ourselves down with unnecessary pressure PERIOD The fact that I am a firstgeneration student should have been enough evidence for me to realize that I was succeeding PERIOD However I was not looking at the big picture I was merely staring down the road that I was just trying to keep barreling along PERIOD If there is one word of advice I have for other first generation college students dealing with these kinds of emotions it is to breathe take a step back and recognize how far you have come PERIOD Remember if you can get yourself here you can do it PERIOD
