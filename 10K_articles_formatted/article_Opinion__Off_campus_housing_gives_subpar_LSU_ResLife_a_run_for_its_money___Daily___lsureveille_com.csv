KirbySmith Hall is being renovated and will reopen temporarily to alleviate the high demand for oncampus housing PERIOD The building will have new paint lights and furniture PERIOD

College is supposed to be one of the best times of your life PERIOD You can finally get out of your parents home and do your own thing PERIOD So one of the main questions is where to live PERIOD

Living in a dorm your first year is supposed to be part of the college experience PERIOD Students seem to buy that PERIOD

Res Halls are much more than just a place to live on campus said elementary education junior and resident assistant Daisha Washington PERIOD They offer a sense of unity and much more onhand resources especially for first year students than offcampus does. aside from being a freshman on campus housing is convenient for people who dont have a car or are just plain lazy PERIOD But for the amount of money on campus housing costs compared to the condition of some dorms and apartments why would anyone want to live on campus Its not worth it PERIOD

My freshman year I paid  per semester to live in a dump called McVoy Hall PERIOD My moms middle aged coworker lived in the same hall when she was at LSU and McVoy looked like it hadnt been renovated since then PERIOD It didnt have a front desk and the lobby housed a hideous big back TV for our entertainment PERIOD At least Dirty Herg had a flat screen and a Wii in their lobby PERIOD The bathrooms looked like something out of a horror movie with around  girls sharing nine shower stalls and even less toilets PERIOD

My sophomore year I moved to East Campus Apartments PERIOD Wow this is nice I thought when I first moved in PERIOD

Yeah right PERIOD The bedroom was the size of a closet the stove burners were leaning sideways the furniture looked like it came from the 1950s and even though I was in an apartment I still had a twinsized bed PERIOD

Junior year you would think I learned my lesson PERIOD Nope PERIOD I am paying  per semester to live in a threebedroom twobathroom apartment which LSU kindly failed to mention was wheelchair accessible PERIOD My living room is a third of the size it was at ECA I have no cabinets in my bathroom hardly any cabinet space in the kitchen and cabinets so low I cant fit any appliances under them PERIOD I also have an ant problem PERIOD Sure my room is twice as big but I still have that twinsized bed PERIOD

If you count from August to May my rent is equivalent to  a month PERIOD I can go to the Woodlands and get a room in a threebedroom apartment with a fullsized bed spacious living area swimming pool newer appliances and other nice amenities for  a month PERIOD Granted not all utilities are included but with Baton Rouges biggest swimming pool in your backyard who cares

Political science and philosophy junior Toni Coaston who lives in University Edge said the big difference for her parents was cost PERIOD

I spend less for  months here than for the two semesters on campus Coaston said PERIOD But for me the bigger difference is the amount of living space PERIOD My room is twice as big and the kitchen has newer appliances. so is trading a few hundred dollars for the ultimate college experience really worth it I am totally in agreement that living on campus your freshman year adds to your college experience PERIOD But with the current condition and high prices of some of LSUs on campus housing choices I would be careful where I choose to live PERIOD Many off campus housing options offer a more enjoyable living experience for more convenient prices PERIOD
