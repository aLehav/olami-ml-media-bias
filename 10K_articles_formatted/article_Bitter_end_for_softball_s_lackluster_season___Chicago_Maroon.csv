2204,2022-03-16,"despite some of its best overall performances of the season softball was bedeviled by the details of the game in its final weekend of play PERIOD

Although the Maroons  outhit their competition  Saturday and Sunday the team dropped three of its four games losing twice at 23rdranked UWOshkosh  to start out the weekend before splitting their twinbill with Lawrence  to finish off the year PERIOD

The losses are a bitter pill for a Chicago squad that has gone through growing pains this season but went  since returning from Arizona PERIOD The Maroons kept most of the weekends contests close in the early going only to give up big innings and lots of runs late PERIOD

Losing in that fashion is even more disappointing because of how well the team played in almost every aspect of the game PERIOD

Offensively we had great at bats we had great focus at the plate and we put the pressure on on offense and our pitching was good again on both days head coach Ruth Kmak said PERIOD

That allaround strength was never more apparent this season than in Saturdays first matchup against Oshkosh PERIOD The game was tied at one through three and a half innings and the Titans had two outs and two on in the bottom of the fourth PERIOD Secondyear pitcher Lauren White  . eRA had a full count against secondyear center fielder Amie Heinzelman and served up what appeared to be strike three PERIOD

Lauren threw strike three which the batter actually swung at but apparently neither umpire saw her swing at it Kmak said PERIOD So it would have been the third out of the inning and the inning would have been over. capitalizing on the bad situation the Titans managed to put up four runs before White could force firstyear second baseman Aerial Spang into grounding out PERIOD The Titans followed up their twoout assault in the fourth with a decisive tworun sixth inning after which they held a  advantage PERIOD Two RBI off a double from firstyear pinch hitter Hannah Lighty in the top of the seventh helped the Maroons narrow the gap to  but Oshkoshs relief pitching held up in the end and secured the win PERIOD

It was a game where we actually outplayed them we outhit them we had probably the best pitching performance all year but they had a couple calls go the other way and we didnt win the game Kmak said PERIOD

The final tally in the days second game wasnt as close but the contest started out just as competitively as the matinee PERIOD Secondyear pitcher Kathleen Duffy  . who pitched four and a third innings in a losing effort kept the Titans off the board until the third when fourthyear catcher Dani Olsen went yard for the games first run PERIOD

Olsens solo shot was an indicator of things to come PERIOD In the fourth Duffy loaded the bases and gave up two runs before Chicago got a single Titan out PERIOD A fielding error let in another run before Chicago could string together the final two putouts PERIOD The inning concluded with three Oshkosh runners stranded and the home team up  PERIOD

After the Maroons left fourthyear catcher Vanessa Pineros and firstyear center fielder Caitlin Romano in scoring position in the top of the fifth the Titans returned to the plate with the same fourrun lead PERIOD Oshkosh wasted no time loading the bases bringing up homerunhitting Olsen with three on and one out PERIOD

Olsen didnt disappoint PERIOD The fouryear letterwinner jacked a grand slam that put the Titans up  bringing the mercy rule into effect and ending the game early PERIOD

Kathleen Duffy was not herself Kmak said of her pitcher PERIOD She has a bicep injury so she didnt throw as well as she has the past few weeks. the Maroons parlayed the talent they showed Saturday into results early Sunday PERIOD After Lawrence walked thirdyear shortstop Jen Jacobson and Pineros singled Duffy homered to center to put Chicago up  in the first PERIOD

In the third Chicago loaded the bases on a string of walks setting up fourthyear infielder Cassie Weiranga to drive in Lighty on a single PERIOD A wild pitch brought home firstyear left fielder Jennifer Simile later in the the inning giving Chicago a  edge PERIOD The Maroons picked up another run in the fourth and although Lawrence got five runs in the sixth and the seventh the Vikings wound up short losing  PERIOD

Giving up runs in the final innings would end up biting Chicago in the nightcap PERIOD RBI from White and Jacobson helped Chicago put four runs on the board during the fifth and sixth and the team led  going into the final inning PERIOD

But in the bottom of the seventh with two runners on fourthyear shortstop Carrie Van Groll smashed a threerun homer tying the game and forcing an extra frame PERIOD Chicago went scoreless in the top of the eighth and in the bottom of the inning Van Groll once more came to the plate with two on and once more took Duffy deep with a threerun longball locking up the Vikings win PERIOD

Dropping three out of four to conclude the season is never fun but the games gave the Maroons much to be hopeful about as they prepare for next spring PERIOD

We didnt have bad at bats at all PERIOD The results werent always the best but the bats were quality at bats all the way through Kmak said PERIOD On defense we were young our outfield was very young this year PERIOD Basically besides first and second base everybody else was in new defensive positions PERIOD Its an ongoing and developing project. your donation will support the student journalists of University of Chicago PERIOD Your contributions go towards our annual website hosting costs and equipment costs PERIOD
