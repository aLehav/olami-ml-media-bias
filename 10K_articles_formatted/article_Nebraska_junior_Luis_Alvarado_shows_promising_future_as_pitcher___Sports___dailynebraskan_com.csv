Its not easy being a twoway player and Luis Alvarado wasnt sure if hed ever be ready PERIOD

And why after hitting . with considerable playing time in his first two collegiate seasons would he even think about trying to develop into both a position player and a pitcher when his path to success seemed exclusively as a hitter

Not even Alvarado can answer that question completely PERIOD

I dont know PERIOD I just felt like it was the right time Alvarado said PERIOD I felt like it was the right time to help the team PERIOD But I dont know why  I have no idea. regardless Alvarados quietly become an asset for coach Darin Erstads bullpen with two scoreless innings and a save in two relief appearances to go along with a . batting average and a teamhigh of three doubles through the first couple weeks PERIOD

For Alvarado its all about comfort PERIOD

Right now inbetween innings its a bit different because Ive got to stay warm and make sure I dont get too tired PERIOD Its a different feeling but I got used to it quick. erstad along with pitching coach Ted Silva must be thrilled Alvarado finally decided to turn the corner and utilize some of his talent PERIOD

Coach Silva has wanted him to pitch for two years now Erstad chuckled PERIOD We wanted him in the outfield but it came to a point where we wanted to give it a try. the process of getting a player ready both mentally and physically to pitch may seem difficult but Alvarado and the coaching staff used summer league and fall ball to prepare the junior from Puerto Rico to pitch in the spring PERIOD

He threw one time this summer Erstad said PERIOD But in the fall it was just about getting the pitching signs the set times the positioning etc PERIOD down PERIOD Those are things that you probably dont think about but hes got to work on all of those things PERIOD And hes done a real nice job with that. alvarado a former 33rdround pick of the Boston Red Sox in the  MLB Draft made his debut on the mound in NUs  loss to No PERIOD  Oregon State Feb PERIOD  when he knocked a double and threw a scoreless inning of relief PERIOD He then shut the door on Nebraskas  win over Utah earning his first career save after working around a leadoff single PERIOD

Alvarado was also a starting pitcher with the Puerto Rico Baseball Academy in high school PERIOD And even though he was a relief option for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League last summer hed never had an opportunity to close out a game PERIOD

It was my first time coming into the last inning. alvarado said PERIOD I felt good I executed my pitches I felt comfortable and my breathing was really good PERIOD I feel comfortable on the mound. and its all about a simplistic approach PERIOD

For me I just try to keep it simple Alvarado said PERIOD You just have to get an out PERIOD You have to face a hitter throw strikes and thats it PERIOD Once you start getting runners maybe its a little different PERIOD But it all feels the same. alvarado also has the benefit of two full collegiate years under his belt regardless of how he spent them PERIOD Erstad also believes age can be as important as anything at this level PERIOD

Being a little bit older and more mature hes able to slow it down Erstad said PERIOD Hes just done a real nice job of grasping all of it PERIOD And to go out there after playing every single inning and pitching once on the first day and then closing that last game that just shows hes in good physical shape as well. sportsdailynebraskan.com
