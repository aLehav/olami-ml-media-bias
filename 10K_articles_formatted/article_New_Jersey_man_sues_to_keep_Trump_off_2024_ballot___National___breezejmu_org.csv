The Center Square A New Jersey man has filed a lawsuit to keep Republican President Donald Trump off the states ballot in next years presidential election PERIOD

In a lawsuit filed in New Jersey Superior Court John Bellocchio alleges that a rarely used clause of the fourteenth Amendment of the U.S PERIOD Constitution prevents the former president from being elected to a second term over his involvement in the Jan PERIOD   attack on the Capitol PERIOD He asks the court to bar Trump from the primary and general election ballots PERIOD

 the 105page complaint reads PERIOD

Bellocchio a former history teacher and unaffiliated voter told local media outlets that the lawsuit is  but adhering to the tenets of the U.S PERIOD Constitution PERIOD

 Bellocchio told The New Jersey Monitor PERIOD 

The fourteenth Amendment approved by Congress in  to help ensure civil rights for freed slaves also bars from office anyone who once took an oath to uphold the Constitution but then engaged in insurrection or rebellion against it PERIOD It was intended to keep former Confederates from serving in the states or federal government following the Civil War PERIOD

In the lawsuit Bellocchio said the public record shows the Jan PERIOD  insurrectionists  forced the Congress to go into recess  .. PERIOD and occupied the United States Capitol  

The New Jersey lawsuit is the latest in a series of fourteenth amendment ballot challenges targeting Trump the frontrunner in a crowded field of GOP candidates facing four criminal trials including one over his alleged role in the Capitol attack PERIOD

Individuals and groups have filed similar lawsuits in more than  states with legal experts predicting that the issue will ultimately land before the U.S PERIOD Supreme Court PERIOD

Liberal groups have been pushing for more than a year for state secretaries to commit to honoring the clause by keeping Trump off the ballot PERIOD So far none have done so though election officials in some blue states like Maine and Connecticut have been conducting reviews to determine if the fourteenth Amendments provisions apply to Trump PERIOD

Legal scholars say the fourteenth Amendment has seldom been used in such legal challenges and they differ on whether it would bar Trump from next years ballot PERIOD

To be sure Trump has denied wrongdoing in the Jan PERIOD  riots and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges related to efforts to overturn the  presidential election PERIOD

His campaign has blasted the fourteenth Amendment challenges as  and pledged to fight them in court PERIOD

Other Republicans have also pushed back hard against the lawsuits arguing that it should ultimately be the voters who decide who appears on the presidential ballot next year PERIOD
