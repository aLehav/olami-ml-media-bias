Record companies have always had one main concern keeping their profits up PERIOD The music industry is terrified right now because they see their sales steadily decreasing and they have chosen the most brightly painted target to point their blame  online file sharing PERIOD

On our campus Residential Networking Coordinator Ryan Esposto who monitors the campus residential Internet system carries an iron stick PERIOD Hes the administrator in charge of stopping the residents who dare to trade copyrighted files on the Internet PERIOD He told The Orion last month he tries to stay out of students hard drives claiming he only follows the laws as they stand PERIOD Its not about looking into Internet use Esposto said PERIOD Instead he believes his duty to be protecting students from themselves. to that end he sends warnings and fines to students who are caught with copyrighted material on their hard drives PERIOD On the other end of campus Dr PERIOD Paul Friedlander director of music industry program has a decidedly different point of view PERIOD

Free music is here to stay says Friedlander PERIOD There are  million people file sharing PERIOD Are they really intent on litigating against all these people No. the record companys strategy has shifted from issuing subpoenas to issuing warnings that tell users to basically delete their files  or else said Yahoo News last month PERIOD But they shouldnt have to PERIOD File sharing shouldnt even be illegal PERIOD It isnt even hurting the music moguls PERIOD Industry experts like Dr PERIOD Friedlander say there is no causal relationship between file sharing and the reduction in CD sales PERIOD

According to Salon.com a University of Texas study had difficulty finding solid proof that file sharing was hurting CD sales PERIOD File sharing actually promotes consumption PERIOD A common claim supporting file sharing is that free music such as radio is actually a huge promoter of music sales PERIOD In truth no one buys music they havent heard before exposure is the key to sales PERIOD Internet file sharing is free promotion so companies have no right to complain PERIOD

The music industry has also turned its focus from developing good artists in favor of onehit wonders PERIOD The future of the artist is not a priority PERIOD The industry is only concerned with selling one album at a time PERIOD

Often times because of the poor contracts given to these briefly famous artists they float across the spotlight and have exited the scene before they have made any substantial money in the business PERIOD If major labels embraced file sharing it could give free exposure to new artists who would then sell millions of followup releases once the band is established PERIOD

This line of thinking is completely lost on record companies PERIOD They refuse to use the developing Internet marketplace to their advantage PERIOD People forget that in the business of music consumers are the largest interest group PERIOD Yet they are without a congressional lobby PERIOD The Digital Millennium Copyright Act which makes it a crime to circumvent antipiracy software was passed because the government sought its expert advice from recording industry professionals who had their own interests at heart rather than those who buy their product PERIOD

In light of that should students feel morally wrong about taking song files from other users on the Web Not according to Friedlander PERIOD

He said there is a morality issue here but it isnt centered on student downloads PERIOD He said the issue is the point to which the record companies take advantage of the artist  giving them a pittance and reaping windfall profits. we need to keep this in mind as we go into battle with these scoundrels PERIOD As students and as citizens this is a fight from which we should not back down PERIOD On the contrary we should take an offensive stance Download like crazy PERIOD

We should also boycott music purchases until its cheaper for us and artists can get a bigger cut PERIOD In the meantime the record companies need to bend a little bit PERIOD Their inflexibility could hurt them in the end because file sharing isnt going anywhere PERIOD

Theyre trying to hold back those trends as long as possible while they rearrange the deckchairs on the titanic to maintain as much control as they can said Friedlander PERIOD

We need to remember that just because something is against the law doesnt mean that youre in the wrong PERIOD Do what you love enjoy music and pirate what you want PERIOD
