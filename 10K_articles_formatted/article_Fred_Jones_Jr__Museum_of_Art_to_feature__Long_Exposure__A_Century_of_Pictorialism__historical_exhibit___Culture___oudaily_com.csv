follows the journey of pictorialism from its roots in the late 1800s to its modern form and explores the ways it influences art today according to a press release PERIOD

The idea of pictorialism began in Europe in the late nineteenth century PERIOD It encouraged the use of painterly technique and started the push for photography to be considered fine art according to the release PERIOD

Fred Jones Interim Director Byron Price said the exhibit will explore the rich history of the pictorialism movement PERIOD Before the idea of pictorialism was introduced photography focused on capturing images exactly as they were with little room for creativity PERIOD

Price said Impressionism was a popular art style at the time and utilized light brushstrokes and thin lines to convey movement and whimsy PERIOD Pictorialists began to experiment with lighting and altering the negatives of developing photographs to appeal to the impressionist trends PERIOD

The purpose of the pictorialist agenda was to support the belief that photography could take on the same techniques of paintings and that it could evoke emotion Price said PERIOD

With the sudden change in photography technique photographers began to advocate for a seat at the fine arts table PERIOD Price said the movement began to fade in the early 1900s but was revived with the boom of the American film industry in the 1950s PERIOD

When promoting films Price said movie theaters would place movie posters outside PERIOD The posters would often be photographs of the characters in the film and incorporate elements of pictorialism to add life and expression to the photos PERIOD

Outside the theater people could look at the way the stars were posed and the way that they looked and they could see almost immediately what kind of character that person would be playing Price said PERIOD

Price said the Long Exposure exhibit will follow the story of the pictorialism movement and photographys journey from a technical skill to the expressive art form used in popular media today PERIOD

 will be on display from Feb PERIOD  to June  at the Fred Jones Jr PERIOD Museum of Art PERIOD
