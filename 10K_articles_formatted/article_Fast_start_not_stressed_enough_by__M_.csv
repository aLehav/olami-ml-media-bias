What a difference three days make PERIOD

After coming out flat and falling behind to Michigan State last Tuesday night the Wolverines looked to start quickly against Bowling Green on Friday night PERIOD All week the Michigan hockey team stressed that a good start could cure many of the teams woes and propel it to victory PERIOD And Friday the Wolverines were able to implement their game plan to perfection coming away with a  win PERIOD

Just one minute into the game sophomore Chad Kolarik came streaking down the right wing and made a nifty stepthrough maneuver to evade two Falcon defenders PERIOD He shot wide of the net but the rebound deflected off freshman Mark Mitera to the waiting stick of senior captain Andrew Ebbett PERIOD

Ebbett took the puck and beat Bowling Green goalie Jimmy Spratt for the first of six Michigan goals PERIOD

But for the Wolverines the firstperiod scoring was not done PERIOD Three minutes later Michigan was on the power play when freshman Travis Turnbull retrieved a loose puck along the boards PERIOD He then whirled around and fired a pass toward the middle of the ice where forward Andrew Cogliano was streaking at the net PERIOD Cogliano collected the pass and fired a shot by Spratt for his first of two goals PERIOD

The early twogoal lead turned out to be insurmountable for the Falcons and acted as a catalyst for the Wolverines sixgoal outburst PERIOD

We were pumped up to play tonight Ebbett said PERIOD We werent happy with the way we came out on Tuesday and we got all the pieces together in the first five minutes PERIOD We took it to them for once. unfortunately for the Wolverines the good start on Friday night did not translate to early success on Saturday night PERIOD An early Bowling Green goal doomed Michigan PERIOD At the fourminute mark of the first period Falcon captain Don Morrison got loose on an oddman rush and fed junior James Unger who backhanded a shot past Michigan goalie Noah Ruden PERIOD

Bowling Green got that first goal and it got the crowd going and they got some confidence said Michigan coach Red Berenson PERIOD
And thats the way the cookie crumbled Michigan defenseman Tim Cook will never forget Friday nights game but whether he remembers the moment he scored his first career goal is still in question PERIOD

I didnt know what was going on Cook said PERIOD I think I blacked

out in the celebration PERIOD It was a good time. two minutes into the second period Bowling Green was on the power play when Cogliano gathered a loose puck at center ice PERIOD The freshman raced down the right wing before passing to forward Tim Miller PERIOD Miller then gave it back to Cogliano who slid the puck back to the streaking Cook PERIOD The junior chipped it past the sprawling Spratt for the Wolverines third goal of the night PERIOD

I didnt really see him Cogliano said PERIOD It was really weird PERIOD He has a pizza flipper as a blade and I just saw that blade and stick behind me so I just dropped the puck PERIOD I told him it was an honor to be a part of his first goal PERIOD

Kolarik was not even on the ice when the play was happening but after seeing the goal he hopped off the bench and retrieved the puck for his teammate PERIOD

Montville sighting There were some unfamiliar characters donning the maize and blue on Friday night PERIOD Sophomore defenseman Jon Montville and senior Morgan Ward made their first appearances at Yost Ice Arena this season PERIOD

Montville and Ward were called to duty because freshman Jason Bailey was out with a rib injury and senior Brandon Kaleniecki was still sidelined with a lingering groin injury PERIOD Freshman defenseman Jack Johnson was serving a onegame suspension because of his disqualification from  last Tuesdays Michigan State game PERIOD With those three unable to play it opened up an opportunity for the seldomused walkons PERIOD

I liked the way Montville and Ward played Berenson said PERIOD They didnt look out of place out there. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
