Jazz Festival to feature top high school musicians

The University of NebraskaLincoln Jazz Festival would go on without Tito Puente but it wouldnt be nearly as good PERIOD

The same can be said for the world of jazz PERIOD

For more than  years Latin jazz percussionist Puente has been pounding the skins for adoring audiences and Saturday night he will do the same at the Lied Center for Performing Arts PERIOD

Along with his Latin Jazz Ensemble Puente performs a fiery form of jazz that has been dubbed   although Puente dislikes the term  around the world PERIOD

Puente has more than  recording credits and his original compositions are as revered in jazz circles as his energetic performances PERIOD

Puente and his Latin Jazz Ensemble will take the Lied Center stage at  p.m PERIOD Tickets for the performance are   and  halfprice for students PERIOD

David Sharp director of UNLs jazz program will give two preperformance talks in the Lied Centers Steinhart Room PERIOD The talks will take place  minutes and  minutes prior to curtain PERIOD
