Cal Poly San Luis Obispos News Source

The Sexual Assault Recovery and Prevention SARP Center of San Luis Obispo County was awarded a  grant from the San Luis Obispo County Community Foundation June  PERIOD

Amber Kennedy fund development coordinator for the SARP Center said that the grant will support the prevention education department specifically with youth in San Luis Obispo PERIOD

The SARP Center provides several services to the community PERIOD

The first is the education department which sends out male and female educators to do general awareness presentations in the community that define sexual assault discuss myths and provide prevention information and resources PERIOD The department also offers selfdefense training for women and presentations on healthy relationships and social pressures for men PERIOD

The second service is crisis management PERIOD

Our 24hour crisis services can benefit Cal Poly students Kennedy said PERIOD Any student that is a victim of sexual assault has been a victim or is the significant other of a victim can call the crisis line at any time for support accompaniment and advocacy. the SARP Center also plays a role on the Cal Poly campus PERIOD

We have a close working relationship with Cal Polys Sexual AssaultFree Environment Resource SAFER program Kennedy said PERIOD We act as a support to the program which relates more to prevention. one Cal Poly faculty member has been closely involved with the SARP center ever since July  PERIOD Kinesiology professor Camille OBryant is currently secretary of the board of directors and she also serves on the executive committee that collaborates with the executive director to evaluate specific goals and objectives of the SARP Center PERIOD

OBryant joined the board of directors because she felt that the programs and services offered by the SARP Center were important to the county and specifically for Cal Poly students PERIOD

Sometimes I think that students would rather talk to someone offcampus about their experience with sexual assault or rape so it is good that there is somewhere like the SARP Center where they can go for those types of services she said PERIOD

Her passion for the SARP Centers goals stemmed from her realization that rape and sexual assault are topics that very few people feel comfortable addressing for a variety of reasons PERIOD

Maybe as survivors it is still too difficult to advocate for change OBryant said PERIOD I think there are still too many myths and misconceptions about rape and sexual assault that disempower women and men to be agents of change or advocates for programs that can educate young people about how they can and should understand that there are people who are willing interested in and able to help them if they are survivors. the SARP Center also provides volunteer opportunities for students who have an interest in nonprofit work and puts on events in which the students can participate PERIOD Walk a Mile in Her Shoes is an annual event that takes place in April which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month PERIOD The awareness and fundraising campaign invites men to walk one mile wearing womens shoes in order to promote conversations about sexual assault and violence PERIOD
