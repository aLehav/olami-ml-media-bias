Its been  days since the Michigan field hockey team has played a competitive match PERIOD But dont think that the Wolverines are feeling rusty PERIOD

We have had some time off but we are definitely back on track and ready to get things started with the Big Ten and defend our championship from last year Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz said PERIOD Emotionally we are doing pretty well too. michigan hosts Massachusetts and Indiana Friday and Sunday respectively PERIOD

The Wolverines ranked fourth nationally in the last National Field Hockey Coaches Association poll were scheduled to play two games last weekend in Connecticut against Boston College and Connecticut PERIOD

Both matches were cancelled due to last weeks terrorist attacks PERIOD

So after a few days off and a few days of what junior forward Molly Powers called pretty intensive practices the Wolverines are more than ready to get back into the competitive atmosphere PERIOD

Its been a while since we have competed against anyone but ourselves Powers said PERIOD Our hearts werent in it last week PERIOD But now we are really looking forward to getting back into action. instead of playing their eight scheduled games before this weekends matches the Wolverines  now only have Fridays game against Massachusetts  to prepare for the beginning of Big Ten play PERIOD

Michigan has not played Massachusetts an NCAA quarterfinalist last year since  PERIOD That year the Minutemen knocked off the Wolverines  PERIOD

Its exciting to play a team that we havent met before and see their different style of play Powers said I think that could help us out. fortunately for Michigan Sundays Big Ten opener just happens to be against an Indiana team that went  last year  including an  loss to Michigan  and has already gotten off to a rocky  start PERIOD

We dont take any team lightly sophomore forward April Fronzoni said PERIOD But we have high expectations of ourselves and were very excited to get going with Big Ten play. although the game is between Michigan and Indiana its safe to say that the people of Oak Park and Lake Bluff Ill PERIOD will be keeping a close eye on the action PERIOD

Thats because five players scheduled to play in the game are from the same Oak Park River Forest High School  Michigans Powers Jessie Veith and Erin Kopelow and the Hoosiers Lindsey Nealis and Margaret Dunne PERIOD

Michigans Molly Maloney along with three Hoosiers attended Lake Forest High School in Lake Bluff PERIOD

The two of them are both freshmen and I think of them as friends from home who I used to play soccer with also Powers said with a smile in reference to the her former teammates from Oak Park PERIOD

I will say its going to be neat for me to show them what the Big Ten is like Powers said PERIOD But hey Im not going to talk any trash. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
