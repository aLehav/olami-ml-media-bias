5418,2021-01-27,"with the adddrop deadline just around the corner many Stanford students are stressed about which classes to keep taking and which to give up on for the next seven weeks PERIOD Some students confidently load themselves with a schedule that will probably knock them out harder than Floyd Mayweather Jr PERIOD on copious amounts of anabolic steroids PERIOD Others prefer to take it easy valuing good sleep a social life and overall sanity PERIOD Strug Ling  has taken an interesting approach towards deciding on his schedule for the remainder of winter quarter enrolling in  oneunit wonders PERIOD

For those who only bother to take fiveunit STEM classes and deem all other courses useless oneunit wonders are introductory classes intended to expose students to a certain field PERIOD They are often taught in the form of seminars faculty panels or private lessons and they typically meet once a week PERIOD The majority of them are graded on a passfail basis however its pretty difficult to not receive credit unless you find it extremely challenging to look at a screen for an hour and type one sentence in the zoom chat if participation is even required PERIOD Many Stanford students opt to add at least one or two of these lowstress classes to their schedule as a way to find their undiscovered interests PERIOD

However Ling has taken things a couple steps further by filling his entire schedule with oneunit wonders PERIOD Ling felt that it was the right decision to make after a taxing fall quarter of completing CS 106C MATH  and the highly exclusive PHYSICS  series PERIOD Although he had originally planned on taking THINK PWR and CS 106D during winter quarter Ling had a lastminute change of heart upon realizing that he forgot to do every assignment over the first two weeks PERIOD After a oneday test run of his new and revamped course load Ling stated

Its pretty great PERIOD I get to meet so many different people in each of my classes and tell them that Im taking  units when in reality I spend most of my time playing Candy Crush and watching paint dry PERIOD No one ever really asks how many units Im taking but I know how much they care about my seemingly heavy course load

With some time left to switch classes Ling is encouraging many of his friends to do the same PERIOD
