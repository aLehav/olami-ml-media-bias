Yang

He was a warmhearted person who cared deeply for those close to him and was always ready to lend a helping hand PERIOD But the only person the likeable 26yearold graduate student from China couldnt help apparently was himself PERIOD

Last Tuesday friends were shocked to learn that Mingxuan Alex Yang a graduate business student had committed suicide on the Interstate in a particularly public way PERIOD It was one day before the start of the spring semester PERIOD

When we first heard the news we thought it was a joke PERIOD It was hard to believe said a close friend of Yang a Chinese student who asked to remain anonymous PERIOD We didnt believe it until we heard it from the police. on Thursday ESU President Michael Shonrock said in a prepared statement that the university was deeply saddened by Yangs death PERIOD

Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends Shonrock said PERIOD

Yang had rented a Chrysler  from a local rental car agency last Tuesday and about  p.m. called the Emporia Police Department on his cell phone to report an accident on Interstate  PERIOD Moments later he shot himself in the head wrecking the car beneath the Prairie Street overpass according to Emporia Chief of Police Gary Smith PERIOD

He planned it ahead Smith said PERIOD We know it was him because he had a script in the car that was basically what he had read off of to police. smith declined to identify the type or caliber of firearm Yang used or say where he obtained it PERIOD That aspect of Yangs death is still under investigation Smith said PERIOD

Yang was from Dalian Liaoning Province according to ESU Media Relations PERIOD He had graduated from Dalian University of Technology before beginning studies at the University of North Texas in Denton PERIOD Yang transferred to ESU in the Spring  semester and was working toward his masters of business administration PERIOD

Friends said they never saw any indication in Yangs behavior that he was planning to commit suicide PERIOD Instead they described him as a happy person even an optimist PERIOD

He always looked so joyful and always had a smile on his face that never went away said another close friend another Chinese student who also asked to remain anonymous PERIOD

Friends said Yang was the kind of person who preferred to take care of others but seldom asked for help for himself PERIOD He even taught many fellow international students how to drive PERIOD

Jack Daniels was his drink of choice and he enjoyed seafood especially lobster and homemade ribs but he hated anything spicy PERIOD

Friends remembered him as Christian who loved films particularly the Harry Potter series PERIOD

He loved going to movies and may have seen two or three movies at a time a friend said PERIOD

One friend compared him to Peter Pan because despite being a big brother figure to many of his friends he was a kid at heart PERIOD

Still those close to him are trying to make sense of his sudden death PERIOD

Unbearable psychological pain is the common element of suicide said Jaqueline Schmidt director of Student Wellness PERIOD People consider killing themselves when they lose hope of finding another way to stop the pain. schmidt encourages anyone who suspects a loved one could be considering suicide to speak up and voice their concerns PERIOD

Whether or not you know how to fix the problem genuine concern can provide a human connection at a critical moment Schmidt said PERIOD The two factors that contribute most to preventing suicide are that a concerned person is available and intervenes and the individual shows a willingness to talk about it openly and frankly. friends say they regret not having known about Yangs internal struggle but that they are comforted because his memory lives on PERIOD

We dont think of him as dead  hes still with us. kenzie Templeton
