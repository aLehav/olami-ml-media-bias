For a club team with no school funding recruiting or coach the womens squash team has evolved to establish a name for itself following a strong season PERIOD

The team founded in  by former University students Kirk Bonner  and Morgan Beeson 12gained notable momentum through the work of Sarah Antonacci  PERIOD Through generous donations from parents and alumni the team has grown to competing in the college circuit PERIOD

Unlike other sports collegiate squash is not a member of the NCAA PERIOD Rather it is run by the College Squash Association which mixes Division I Division III and club teams together in rankings PERIOD This leads to the Bison facing schools with extensive program infrastructure including season rivals Boston College Georgetown Vassar and Haverford PERIOD

As a club team with no coach no school funding and no recruitment we are at a major disadvantage when playing against wellestablished varsity teams PERIOD However we found great success this season and managed to play competitive matches and see wins against varsity programs with fullyrecruited players and coaching staffs cocaptain Cleo Greenwood  said PERIOD

Following the programs best regular season in history with just two losses the team earned a spot to compete at the Womens College Squash National Championships last weekend at Princeton University PERIOD Their bracket consisted of all varsity team and Northeasterns club team that had school funding and a coach PERIOD After beating Northeastern  the team solidified their status as the best club team in the nation and No PERIOD  overall PERIOD

We have a very young team and firstyears make up nearly half of our roster PERIOD Since our program is completely selfrun it is up to the players to show up to practice work on their skills and commit to advancing them PERIOD I have been blown away by the progress that every player has made this season and their willingness to work to be the best club team in the nation Greenwood said PERIOD

Now that the team has established itself as an unstoppable club team the possibilities with school funding andor coaches seem limitless PERIOD

I hope that this seasons success will motivate the school to view us as worthy of becoming a varsity program in the coming years PERIOD In order to compete at the highest level possible I am hoping to become a varsity program in the coming years so that we can utilize a coaching staff and be able to recruit players PERIOD In the meantime I am looking forward to continued success against varsity teams and remaining the countrys best club team Greenwood said PERIOD
