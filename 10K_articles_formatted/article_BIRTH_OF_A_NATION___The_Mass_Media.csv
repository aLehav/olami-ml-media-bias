No make no mistake about it PERIOD The world will be informed of just what shape its balance of power will be and just what kind of freedom it will be permitted to enjoy PERIOD

We will defend our allies and our interests. who are Americas allies Well until just recently among Americas allies were the powers of a united NATO trust PERIOD In only a matter of months the tide has turned PERIOD A longstanding unity that for generations served as a bulwark for Liberty and Freedom lies torn and tattered PERIOD After all what do the bared talons of The Eagle require of an Old Europe Out of our way Your interests are no longer ours

We will show purpose without arrogance. the world can hardly mistake a purpose of some kind behind the promised war of Shock and Awe. but just what can this purpose be Liberty and Freedom we are told PERIOD And how can there be any arrogance when Liberty and Freedom are at stake No You are either with us or youre against us

Who might soon even dare mention the word arrogance

We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. how prescient were the men who crafted these prophetic words

Who would doubt The Eagles strength Only a madman from Baghdad We are resolved against his aggression and bad faith As to any aggression on our part It is justified for our security As to bad faith Everyone knows that this madman from Baghdad has been linked  no  is responsible for the September eleventh attacks PERIOD The evidence has been laid bare for all the world to see PERIOD

In the days immediately following the September eleventh attacks U.S PERIOD Secretary of State Colin Powell promised the world a white paper that would leave no doubt as to who the perpetrators of the attacks were PERIOD It is now March thirteenth  PERIOD The world is still waiting for the revealing white paper. should it ever arrive it will certainly be interesting to see how much white remains on the paper after blackouts have been imposed PERIOD 

And to all nations we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth. the Birth of a Nation. perhaps that will be the standing motto that history will attach to this first administration of the twenty-first century PERIOD Can any nation Dare any nation question the speaking voice or the values that are being given birth by America today

America at its best is compassionate. tell that to a world that once looked to America as a beacon for Freedom and Liberty PERIOD Tell that to a world that looks in vain for an American resolve based on diplomacy and respecting international law PERIOD

Tell the Iraqi mothers and children who will soon become collateral damage to The Mother of All Bombs about America at its best  about Americas compassion PERIOD
