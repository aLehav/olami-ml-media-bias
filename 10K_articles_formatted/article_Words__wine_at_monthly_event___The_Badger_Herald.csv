While walking down West Johnson Street on a Thursday evening youd expect to find a couple early revelers some buses and maybe a few pregame parties PERIOD But every month something special takes place there and people are starting to pay attention PERIOD

An innocuous loft resides on the corner of Bassett and Johnson that hosts one of Madisons most upandcoming social event The Book Swap PERIOD

The venue  aptly dubbed The Attic  provides a different sort of party on the third Thursday of every month PERIOD Instead of the routine bangers so common on campus The Book Swap offers an interesting new way to interact with people PERIOD

I wanted to start another kind of theme party Book Swap founder Nisha Pai said PERIOD You come with a book any kind any number and trade yours for someone elses. pai started Madisons Book Swap this year after going to a similar party in Paris PERIOD Madison has a lot of classy events Pai said PERIOD But there wasnt anything that was oriented toward younger people. the original book clubs took place at exclusive venues that rarely let in people who couldnt afford a Hugo Boss suit PERIOD

The Madison version keeps its classy roots members are encouraged to dress up but maintains a homey grassroots atmosphere that welcomes any guests PERIOD

I want people to expect to meet new people and get a good book out of it Pai said PERIOD

Some people come and they just want to party which is OK PERIOD But there are also a lot of interesting conversations that start when people bring up their books and try to tell others why they should read it. book Swaps occur in The Attic the appropriate title Pai has given to the top level of her college apartment PERIOD

The space is big enough to fit maybe four sedans side to side PERIOD The tight space merely adds to the feeling of community that permeates the events PERIOD Adding further to the ambiance at swaps are Christmas lights disco balls and a live jazz band PERIOD

We usually get around  or  people up there Pai said PERIOD

Many of the conversations start with people seeing books they like and trying to make the case that their book is worth the other PERIOD

Someone who brings say an old copy of Cosmo will have to practice expert seduction to get that copy of American Psycho he has always wanted PERIOD It is all about trust and seduction PERIOD

Guests at The Book Swap have brought works ranging from thick tomes on etiquette to popup books to standard literary classics PERIOD

Someone traded me Lolita at one Pai said and an Icelandic book called The Pets. people often bring wine to share at the events in order to help loosen the inhibitions that often prevent quality intellectual discourse PERIOD Often there will be a couple boxes of wine at The Attic in addition to an array of bottles donated by guests for the attendants imbibing pleasure PERIOD

The hardest donation for Book Swap to get was free entertainment PERIOD

I knew I needed a live band for The Book Swap to truly be classy Pai said but everyone wanted lots of money. it was hard getting a live band to come at first PERIOD I posted fliers asking for a three or fourpiece jazz band but I never got any response PERIOD I wanted them to play just for the experience Pai said of her struggle PERIOD

I ended up posting in Reddits Madison board pleading for someone to help out PERIOD In a week or two I got an email from a local band called Studio B Pai said PERIOD

Studio B turned out to be a smashing success and is now the resident band at The Attics events PERIOD

The Book Swap has gone from a foreign enterprise to Madisons newest cultural hot spot PERIOD Its future holds plenty more parties where guests can trade books and drink wine in the classy locale they have all been waiting for PERIOD

The next installment of The Attics Book Swap series is next Thursday Feb PERIOD  from  to  p.m PERIOD at  N PERIOD Basset Street PERIOD Hosts encourage guests to dress nicely and bring a book to trade PERIOD Studio B performs at The Dragon Fly Lounge March
