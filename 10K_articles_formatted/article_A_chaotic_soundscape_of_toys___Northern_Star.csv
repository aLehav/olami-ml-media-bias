Hail to the band that only comes to the U.S PERIOD once every decade PERIOD

OK theyre here more often than that but there was a twoyear gap between the last time Radiohead came to the Midwest and last Saturdays show at Wisconsins Alpine Valley PERIOD

Radiohead opened the show the same way it opened several shows on its latest U.S PERIOD tour with the opening tracks off its latest album Hail to the Thief. however  or Sit Down Stand Up didnt really prove Radioheads live performance at Saturdays show PERIOD Instead Radiohead proved themselves with two new heavily electronic tracks Backdrifts and The Gloaming. backdrifts began with a deep bass drum played by drummer Phil Selway and bass melody by Colin Greenwood PERIOD At first the audience seemed confused as to which song the band was playing but once the melody kicked in it was clear that Backdrifts was a live force with which to be contended PERIOD It ended with a short electronic jam Johnny Greenwood provided the chaotic soundscape with all sorts of interesting toys Radiohead has acquired over the years PERIOD

Later in the show The Gloaming proved that while Radiohead began as an average rock band they have become masters at electronics and synthesizers PERIOD As usual frontman Thom Yorkes vocals acted like an instrument all night especially in You and Whose Army from Amnesiac the evenings first encore PERIOD This song happened to be one of the more entertaining of the night though there wasnt a moment during the show that Yorke or Greenwood werent entertaining as Yorke seated at a piano with a camera in his face made goofy faces at the audience and encouraged them to participate as he sang the lyrics PERIOD

Come on if you think You can take us on You and whose army You and your cronies. then the band joined in for the triumphant conclusion of the song We ride tonight PERIOD Ghost Horses. you and Whose Army was the only Amnesiac track played that night PERIOD The band dabbled a little bit into Kid A with songs like The National Anthem and a fantastic version of Idioteque. from the Grammy Awardwinning album OK Computer the band played radio hits like Paranoid Android and Karma Police. the only preOK Computer songs played were Just and Fake Plastic Trees. the final song of the night was Everything in its Right Place and it couldnt have made a better ending for the show PERIOD One by one beginning with Yorke the band members left the stage PERIOD Once all the band members departed an electronic loop played over and over with the faint sounds of Yorkes voice still lingering PERIOD The word Forever flashed in big letters on the stage PERIOD Then it disappeared and the sounds ended the show was over PERIOD

Come back soon Radiohead  two years is just too long to wait PERIOD
