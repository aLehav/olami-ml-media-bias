With the beginning of the fall  semester just days away Moorpark College faculty and staff prepare not only their coursework but safety and emergency preparedness as well PERIOD

On Friday morning Lieutenant Greg Beckley led a presentation for staff and faculty stressing the important role that every member of the campus community plays in campus safety PERIOD

If you see something strange on campus please make the campus police aware said Beckley PERIOD

Recounting an incident when someone drove their car onto Raider Walk before entering a building and making loud threatening statements for several hours before leaving Beckley stated that no one alerted campus police during that incident PERIOD

Silvia Barajas Vice President of Business Services chimed in to reiterate the importance of see something say something. sometimes we see a car on Raider Walk and we think Oh thats okay said Barajas PERIOD  It really isnt okay PERIOD If there are things that dont look right sound right those are things we need to get used to reporting. campus police can also be made aware of nonemergency situations by using a free app called TipNow PERIOD  The app allows users to anonymously report all kinds of situations including bullying theft depression or stalking PERIOD  This app is not to be used for emergency situations as reports may not be relayed to officers immediately according to Beckley PERIOD

Beckley also spoke about the colleges Behavior Intervention Team PERIOD Made up of several staff and faculty members the teams goal is to address and assess any potentially troubling behavior concerning a member of the campus community and to provide assistance or disciplinary actions depending on the situation according to Beckley PERIOD

Weve had B.I.T.s where a student comes in showing signs of abuse said Beckley PERIOD  We were able to schedule counseling for that student and discovered an offcampus dating relationship that had become abusive. some members of the audience expressed concern that reporting a B.I.T PERIOD might reflect poorly on a students records PERIOD  Beckley stressed that B.I.T PERIOD reports do not remain on a students record and will not by themselves negatively impact a student PERIOD

The B.I.T PERIOD process is designed tobring to bear certain resources to help a student said Beckley PERIOD  It is not designed to be a punitive action PERIOD If it makes you uncomfortable then its BIT worthy. moorpark has five fulltime officers on campus and  cameras PERIOD This allows campus police to be aware of much of what is happening on campus but there are still blind spots and the campus police need everyones help to keep the campus safe PERIOD

If ever a student or faculty needs to report a situation they can contact the Moorpark College Police Station at   PERIOD
