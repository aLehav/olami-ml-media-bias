Reality television usually isnt reality at all but more of a scripted reality PERIOD Some shows are good while others are bad PERIOD Some can be fairly entertaining others I cant stand PERIOD Yes reality shows are supposed to be there to entertain us but at what cost

Essentially reality shows have become a nonreality PERIOD They are supposed to be representations of real life but what is presented is something that is so ridiculous and extreme that it becomes a show which seems so unreal in its representations PERIOD There are shows such as Extreme Couponing Sister Wives Breaking Amish and who can forget the gem that isToddlers  Tiaras. whether its about a polygamist teenagers leaving the Amish community housewives trying to save a few dollars or little girls with a lot of cakedon makeup all of these shows exploit certain kinds of lifestyles PERIOD I assume not many viewers can relate to cougars or toddler beauty queens and maybe those are the aspects that make it entertaining PERIOD But its a cheap form of entertainment if you ask me PERIOD What these reality shows do is suck you in with the absurd PERIOD They make you watch one episode and then you feel compelled to watch another until you have watched a whole season PERIOD

Another problem with reality television is there is nothing wholesome or value based about it PERIOD The shows are usually variations of the same thing a dysfunctional family drama drama drama or winning money  usually  million PERIOD What does this reflect about what we place importance on in our society today Why has becoming famous and winning money become what people aspire to

This thrill of fame and money is seen with the plethora of talent seeking shows that seem to be on every major television station PERIOD American Idol The X Factor and The Voice are essentially the same show with different celebrity judges PERIOD These Networks keep adding more of these talent shows which are entertaining for a season but then they lose their sheen when the winner is announced and the process repeats PERIOD

Now Im not saying there arent entertaining shows because there are a few PERIOD What I am saying is that the content of some of the shows needs to be changed and not be so exploitative PERIOD

We are in a digital age and younger generations are watching more television and are probably more influenced by television than anything else PERIOD If younger generations are watching extreme illusory shows then their actions will be affected accordingly PERIOD If its on television then it can be wrongly justified as being correct behavior and thats where we run into a problem PERIOD There is nothing that is acceptable about justifying obscene social behaviors on reality shows PERIOD

Behavioral attitudes are usually about mimicking something that you see and believe is acceptable PERIOD So if shows out there are trashy then some younger people are going to think that the behavior in reality shows is the proper way to act PERIOD Reality shows could have a major influence in a bad way for those who are still distinguishing between right and wrong PERIOD Take Jersey Shore for example PERIOD This show is targeted toward younger people so it has influence over a wide audience that is still in a sense maturing PERIOD And no good comes from watching a bunch of ignorant people get into fights and get wasted all the time PERIOD My prayers were answered when this season was announced to be the last PERIOD

Shows such as Jersey Shore arent something that should be put on television PERIOD Snooki is considered a celebrity because of the show and everyone knows that celebrities become role models PERIOD Should younger people be looking to the Jersey Shore cast or any reality show cast as role models Think about that for a minute PERIOD Are these the role models that we want Do we want reality stars to become role models

What I hate most about reality television is that its cheap entertainment PERIOD There are no prolific or thoughtprovoking storylines and they usually consist of people who have weird quirks who like to yell at each other PERIOD

However there are a select few shows that deviate from the standard of reality television and I dont really have a problem with those shows PERIOD One show that I enjoy that would be considered a reality show is MythBusters. its an educational and entertaining show PERIOD There is nothing exploitative about it and the two main hosts are likeable intelligent people PERIOD I also find The Amazing Race to be a fairly decent reality show PERIOD Its entertaining and despite the fact that there is prize money it helps the contestants in building teamwork and relying on others PERIOD Its a show where participants learn a lot about themselves and see other parts of the world that may not be as desirable PERIOD It opens up not only the participants eyes but also the viewers eyes to issues that are present around the world particularly in Africa and India PERIOD

In regards to watching television I find myself relating more with scripted shows than I do to reality shows PERIOD In a way thats a little messed up PERIOD If its reality then isnt that supposed to be more real or at least give the illusion of being relatable I can honestly say that I related and learned more from Boy Meets World than I have any reality show PERIOD And thats saying something if the nonreality is more relatable than the reality PERIOD Reality television is what is wrong with America today PERIOD We place too much importance on television and its definitely something that needs to be changed PERIOD
