On May  the Oakland Raiders in partnership with the San Diego Chargers agreed to purchase nearly  acres of land in Carson PERIOD The Raiders and the Chargers are trying to acquire new stadiums in their current homes but they are pursuing the Carson proposal if a deal does not present itself PERIOD

The announcement came just two days before the NFL owners meetings held at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in San Francisco last week PERIOD All three of the teams seeking potential relocation to Southern California including the St PERIOD Louis Rams gave updates on their current stadium situations at the owners meetings on Wednesday PERIOD The land deal is contingent upon the two teams purchasing the land together in order to build a joint stadium for the two California franchises in Carson PERIOD

The Raiders were the only team out of the three that still had not produced a financial blueprint for a new stadium in its current city which led NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to say that the city needs to create a proposal about how they are going to keep the Raiders in Oakland at a press conference in San Francisco last Wednesday PERIOD

Raiders owner Mark Davis is confident that the team can stay in Oakland if a stadium can be built PERIOD
If we can get something done in Oakland were staying in Oakland Davis said at a press conference with the media last Wednesday PERIOD

According to Davis the team and the league are willing to contribute  million which would leave another  million to be covered by the city and Alameda County PERIOD This is something that voters are unlikely to approve considering that taxpayers in Oakland and Alameda County are still responsible for over  million that went to renovations to Oakland Coliseum when the Raiders returned to the Bay Area from Los Angeles in  PERIOD

In a press conference last week new Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said the city intends to keep all of the cities sports teams. however Mayor Schaaf also said that the city couldnt afford to help fund a new stadium PERIOD

Fans protested at the steps of the hotel in San Francisco where the meetings were held last Wednesday in order to bring some attention to the issue PERIOD

I have been a season ticket holder for over  years even before they moved John Garcia said PERIOD I do my part financially to help the team and so does everybody I know PERIOD This sucks and if they move the backlash will be huge. city officials are hopeful that an investor will come forward in order to help fund a stadium and keep the team in Oakland PERIOD However the NFL and Goodell are looking to put some pressure on the city to get a stadium proposal done PERIOD

The NFL originally set January  as the final month for teams to apply for relocation in the upcoming season PERIOD However on Wednesday Goodell said that he was considering moving that date up to later this year since there are multiple teams interested in relocating to the same area in California PERIOD

Oakland and Alameda County hired San Diego businessman Floyd Kephart to produce financing for a new Oakland stadium as well as additional money to redevelop the surrounding East Oakland area PERIOD According to city officials Kephart said he is on track to meet the June  deadline set by the league which requires a preliminary financing plan and information about all of the investors that are involved PERIOD

The city county and league are hopeful that the Raiders will stay in Oakland but the team will continue to pursue its stadium options in Carson now that a conditional parcel acquisition agreement has been reached PERIOD
