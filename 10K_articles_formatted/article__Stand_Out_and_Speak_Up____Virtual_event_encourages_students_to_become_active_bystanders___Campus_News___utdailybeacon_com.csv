UT students walking to class while following the universitys Covid19 policies on Thursday August   PERIOD

On Tuesday Jan PERIOD  there was a virtual event entitled Stand Out and Speak Up sponsored by the Jones Center for Leadership and Service PERIOD

This event sought to educate UT students and staff on how to become an active bystander PERIOD For those unfamiliar with the term an active bystander is someone who takes the initiative to defuse difficult conflicts that they stumble upon either in their own communities or elsewhere PERIOD

The event was conducted by host Cierra Burnett and presenter Bilqis AmatusSalaam as a part of the CMJ Student Leadership series PERIOD

At the beginning of the presentation AmatusSalaam discussed barriers to and solutions for intervening. she touched on the fact that oftentimes it is taught that great leaders do the right thing when no one else is watching PERIOD AmatusSalaam turned this clich on its head by stating that it can be harder to do the right thing when othersarewatching. this insight rang true as audience members learned about social influence fear of judgement and the concept of diffusion of responsibility  a phenomenon which occurs when ones sense of duty fades because they expect others to act first PERIOD

Although turnout for the event was not substantial likely due to its virtual nature the small audience allowed for a greater amount of intimacy and interactivity PERIOD One attendee reflected on experiences of moving beyond their comfort zone PERIOD

Revelations such as this can reshape how people feel about virtual events PERIOD They are not always ideal but sometimes one will encounter a snippet of digital humanity PERIOD Such a treasure is especially valuable during these challenging times PERIOD

When asked why Burnett and AmatusSalaam thought it was important to hold the event the host and presenter responded with goals of engagement and hope for students futures PERIOD

There arent as many opportunities in leadership development for students to engage in those kinds of development things  unless it is with a student leadership position where theyre being required to apply and interview AmatusSalaam said PERIOD

She then went on to explain how this information is .. PERIOD opening up the door for people who dont have titles or leadership positions to gain some development in this area. burnett then explained that bystander intervention is usually only discussed .. PERIOD as it relates to alcohol risk reduction and sexual harassmentmisconduct prevention. which is all super critical but I think there are situations that happen when an active bystander is necessary outside of those circumstances Burnett said PERIOD

If anyone missed this presentation and would like to catch the next one there are many more coming up PERIOD

Clay Jones a former CEO of a fortune  company will be giving five lessons on leadership on Feb PERIOD  and there will also be another about effectively communicating across difference on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD The latter event will act as a . version of Stand Out and Speak Up
