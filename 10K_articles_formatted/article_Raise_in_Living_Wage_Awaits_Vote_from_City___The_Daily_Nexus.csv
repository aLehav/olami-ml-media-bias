4121,2006-02-15,"the Santa Barbara City Council will soon decide whether to approve a new living wage ordinance that could raise the minimum wage for local companies contracting with the city by more than six dollars thanks to a decision by the councils finance committee yesterday PERIOD

The city council has been working on the living wage ordinance for the past year in response to pressure from advocate groups representing many of the employees of companies that do business with the city PERIOD Yesterday the SB City Council Finance Committee decided to pass a finalized draft of the ordinance to the council for approval at its March  meeting PERIOD Lisa Pompatarin a consultant and former staffer at the Santa Barbara for a Living Wage SB4LW organization said the proposed ordinance calls for certain companies to pay regular employees  an hour PERIOD

Robert Peirson finance director for the city of Santa Barbara said the ordinance would only directly affect employees working on projects for the city PERIOD

The draft was completed in September Peirson said PERIOD The ordinance is fairly limited in its scope  it will only apply to service contractors doing work with the city. the wage increase will help people who tend to get paid less than the cost of living in the county Pompatarin said PERIOD She said the employees of companies contracting with the city of Santa Barbara help the city to function and are often paid with money the city raises through taxes PERIOD

Were reaching for people that use our tax dollars but arent direct employees of the city Pompatarin said PERIOD These are the people that clean our streets and our linen. peirson said the council decided to draft a living wage ordinance last March and passed the issue to the City Council Ordinance Committee which then began drafting a proposal for the ordinance PERIOD He said he does not know how the proposed ordinance will impact Santa Barbara if it is approved PERIOD

Its hard for us to estimate that impact will be because the city has never done anything like this before Peirson said PERIOD We really dont know until it is put into effect. pompatarin said Santa Barbara for a Living Wage  a coalition of local labor religious and community organizations that is pushing for a living wage  hopes the ordinance will pass because the organizations leaders think it will positively impact many local citizens PERIOD

Were hoping to affect a couple thousand people Pompatarin said PERIOD It would be a really big jump psychologically for people that get paid . an hour. peirson said the final draft of the ordinance takes the demands of local groups including SB4LW into account PERIOD He said he believes the groups would like to see the city council expand the ordinance to include employers not working for the city but he said he thinks the proposed ordinance is a good start for the city PERIOD

The ordinance basically includes everything they wanted Peirson said PERIOD They were in here today asking for the breadth of the ordinance to be expanded but this is definitely a first step. pompatarin said Self Sufficiency Standard a group that conducts research on the cost of living in all California counties determined that city employees in Santa Barbara should be paid a minimum of . per hour PERIOD She said the ordinance committee altered the city councils original proposal from  per hour for employees with health benefits and . per hour for employees without benefits to a standard living wage of  per hour PERIOD

Pompatarin said she believes that the ordinance committees final draft of the proposed living wage ordinance is based on the committees assumption that renting a studio apartment in Santa Barbara costs less than it actually does PERIOD

Its based on research that shows you can rent a studio for  and we all know you cant do that in Santa Barbara  you might get a halfbedroom Pompatarin said PERIOD So thinking about that our proposed wage is probably a low average. if the living wage ordinance passes Santa Barbara will become one of the  cities in California that have a living wage law Pompatarin said PERIOD She said there is currently no way to tell how much the typical employee of a business contracting with the city is paid because every company pays its workers different amounts PERIOD

Its hard to tell what employees are paid now because all contracts are different Pompatarin said PERIOD Some pay their employees really close to what were proposing and some arent. pompatarin said she thinks the city council is more likely to approve this proposal than past plans for a living wage ordinance but she said she is worried the council might further reduce the minimum wage before passing the ordinance PERIOD She said she thinks the council should pass the ordinance because it will help the local residents who need it the most PERIOD

Its not like the whole city needs a raise Pompatarin said PERIOD Its looking more favorably that it will be passed than ever before. print
