Oklahoma State golfers Viktor Hovland and Matthew Wolff pose for a photo during the first Cowboy Choice Awards at GallagherIba Arena in Stillwater on Monday April  PERIOD

No golfer dressed alike but there was a connection many shared PERIOD

Whether wearing bright green shirts adorned with a Nike swoosh like Matthew Wolff or a whitespeckled navyblue Puma shirt like Bryson DeChambeau many golfers wore a small silver pin PERIOD

The pin an outline of a child with its hand clasped together in reverence is the logo of Saint Jude Childrens Hospital PERIOD It was unanimously worn by golfers at the FedEx St PERIOD Jude Invitational Golfers at TPC Southwind in Memphis on Sunday PERIOD

Like their fellow top golfers OSU Cowboys Viktor Hovland and Matthew Wolff played in the tournament PERIOD

The two exCowboys shooting up the professional golfing ranks joined the starstudded field PERIOD While the purse was a healthy . million  with . million alone awarded to winner and former Oklahoma Sooner Abraham Ancer who won a playoff at  PERIOD The money wasnt the only reason big names riddles the field PERIOD

As a partner with the tournament St PERIOD Jude Childrens Hospital is on the receiving end of many charitable dollars raised by the event PERIOD

The Memphisbased hospital does not charge patients for care and the FedEx Saint Jude invitational sees most of its invitations to golf biggest names answered because it is a little bit different PERIOD

Hovland and Wolff joined the biggest names in their sport including Brooks Koepka Jordan Spieth Dustin Johnson Hideki Matsuyama Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy PERIOD

I think the PGA Tour does a great job in all the communities that they visit of raising charitable dollars and doing a really good job with that but I think more so than anywhere else here in Memphis and Saint Jude McIlroy said PERIOD

Whether generated through the stand selling  popsicles and pledging all proceeds to St PERIOD Judes or the custom pizzathemed golf shoes designed by a patient that returningchampion Justin Thomas wore to raise awareness the generous hospital is generously helped by the tournament PERIOD

It makes me feel very fortunate that Im able to do what I do but also very fortunate that I can come to a community like Memphis or go all over this country and know that by turning up and playing golf that youre doing good some good for the community that youre in McIlroy said PERIOD

For Wolff his finishing score of 7under was probably disappointing PERIOD He shot 6under par on the first day of the tournament before slowing down PERIOD For Hovland ranked No PERIOD  in the world golf rankings his final score of  good for a piece of thirty-sixth place was also a disappointment PERIOD

Harris English led for much of the tournament and peaked at  before seeing his score crumble after making a pair of double bogeys PERIOD

When his putt to birdie the final hole and join the playoff ran out of speed and put an end to his day the disappointment he felt was buoyed by the sight he saw PERIOD Patients of Saint Judes including a girl who battled leukemia stood watching in the shade of the white metal grandstand PERIOD

I saw the 17yearold girl on  PERIOD It kind of makes you think about theres stuff bigger than golf English said PERIOD Were still trying to compete out here PERIOD Youre still feeling it PERIOD I wanted to make the putt on  to get into the playoff and have a chance to win the tournament but seeing the Saint Jude kids off  it hits a little different. according to Rory McIlroy after all the score matters a little less in Memphis PERIOD

You feel the difference it makes when you see the kids and you can talk to the kids and you just think about what theyve went through McIlroy said PERIOD It sort of makes a bogey or birdie on the last not really mean anything. sports.edocolly.com
