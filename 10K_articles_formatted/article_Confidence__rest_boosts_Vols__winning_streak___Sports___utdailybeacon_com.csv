That means taking Sundays off lessening the amount of contact the team sees in practice and giving players like Golden who spend more time on the floor the rehab they need to compete in the next game PERIOD Martin said they also watch a lot of film to get a feel for upcoming teams PERIOD

 Martin said PERIOD Now you go fiveforfive 10for15 and  from the three point line PERIOD It is the same guys PERIOD It is just a level of confidence believing in themselves and more importantly not giving up and I give them a lot of credit for because you have those tough game those roller coaster type games where you are up and down win one lose two win three PERIOD It is just so emotionally taxing on the body and the mind PERIOD It just takes a toll on you PERIOD Give these guys a lot of credit for standing and fighting.Im not gonna say its a must win but its definitely something that will build the resumeBeating a topfive team in the nation is always gonna be a great win for you but I still think with whatever happens were still gonna have a shot. log In
