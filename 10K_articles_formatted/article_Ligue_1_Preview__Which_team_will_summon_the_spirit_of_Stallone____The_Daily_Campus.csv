6978,2023-11-03,"rocky one PERIOD Apollo Creed is forced to select a local contender after his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injury PERIOD Who is that opponent you ask None other than Rocky Balboa PERIOD A fight that was booked as an exhibition match exceeded all expectations when it went to an unprecedented  rounds with each competitor giving it their all and refusing to concede PERIOD Although Balboa would unsurprisingly lose by virtue of a split decision they made a pact just before the final bell that there would be no rematch PERIOD

ParisSaint Germain is Creedthe heavyweight boxing world champion who competes at the highest level of professional boxing PERIOD This competition however is only found outside of France with the Parisian club more fearful of teams in the UEFA Champions League than teams in their own league PERIOD The local competitors are as follows LOSC Lille Olympique Lyonnais AS Monaco MontpellierHraultSC and Olympique de Marseille PERIOD

In that order those teams currently make up positions two through six in the table with Paris SaintGermain sitting two points clear at the top PERIOD Lille Lyonnaisand Monaco are similar to Balboa in the sense that they have experience.Rocky fought primarily in small gyms and  by all accounts  was considered an amateur boxer PERIOD In effect although he would be unmatched by quite a large margin he at least could cling onto the basics of fighting PERIOD These three teams are in a similar position although Lille last won the league in  they finished runners up in  and fourth in  PERIOD Most significantly they have only lost one match in all competitions this seasonand currently sit atop theirEuropa League group with11points having qualified to the Round of  with one game still to play PERIOD

SimilarlyMonaco have also had success both domestically and abroad PERIOD The club has won eight league titles in their history with the most recent one coming in  PERIOD Not to mention the fact that they nearly became the second French team to ever win the Champions League in  when they faced FC Porto in the final falling  PERIOD Finally the 2010s saw them make a quarterfinal and semifinal respectively after a nineyear absence from Europes elite competition PERIOD

By the same token Lyonnais have won the league title an impressive seven times and just recently made it to the Champions League semifinals something they had not done since  PERIOD

So whatsmy point Well its that PSG may not be fearful of these select three but the Qataribacked club knows they have a grasp on what it takes to compete at the highest level PERIOD However in order to keep the French champions on edge they must put their foot on the gas and be relentless when it comes to getting results PERIOD Why Well the month of December is right before thewinterbreak PERIOD Ifany of these teams want to keep pushing for the impossible they have to go intothebreak with momentumin order to have confidence going into an even more important stretch of the season the last five months PERIOD

However lets stay in the present PERIOD Lille are set to take on Monaco at the Stade PierreMauroyon Dec PERIOD  at 7a.m.LesDogues currently sit second in the table with  points while LesMongasques sit in fourth with the same point tally of  PERIOD

Lille go into the contest with momentum having just come off a massive comeback win against Sparta Prague in the Europa League on Thursday Dec PERIOD  PERIOD Although the contest seemed all but lost for the French side when Prague scored in the seventy-first minute Turkish forwardBurakYilmaz came in and did what hesdone all season turn the game on its head PERIOD He scored three minutes after coming in to tie it at one a piecebefore making it two four minutes after giving Lille the victory and clinching their spot in the Round of  PERIOD As previously mentioned Yilmazs form should come to no ones surprise as he is the clubs top domesticscorer with six goals in  games PERIOD Despite his solid efforts he is not the only dangerous player on the squad PERIOD Winger Jonathan Bamba leads the team in assists domestically tallying five in  matches played PERIOD

In Europe promising attacking midfielder YusufYazicileads the club with goals scoring six in the four matches hes played PERIOD In addition Jonathan David leads his team in assists with two in his last four games PERIOD

To say head coach ChristopheGaltierssquad is playing above what is expected of them would be an understatement PERIOD The teams ability to counter at will is only strengthened by their pacey wingers threatening anydefensein the league PERIOD Be that as it may NikoKovawont be too fussed about all this especially with the way his team is performing PERIOD

Monaco have not lost a game since the end of Octobertheir most recent victories include a stunning  comeback win over the Parisian giants and a  pummeling ofNmesOlympique PERIOD Although their recent form is quite convincing they need to begin showing consistency against big teams PERIOD Although they did defeat PSG they have been dominated by other top contenders such as a  loss to Lyonnais in October PERIOD If the squad can prove to be consistent on Sunday then they will continue to pose a legitimate threat to the league leaders PERIOD

Olympique Lyonnais travel to the Stade Municipal SaintSymphoriento face FC Metz on Sunday Dec PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD It would be a surprise to see LesGones travel back to Lyon without all three points considering their recent form PERIOD They last lost in September  yes September  and last dropped points on Nov PERIOD  to a difficult Lille side PERIOD From thenon all their matches have been victories PERIOD

Their position in the table must be accredited to Dutch superstar Memphis Depay PERIOD Not only is the forward the clubs topscorer in the league having put it in the back of the net five times in the  games he has played but he also leads Lyonnais with four assists PERIOD A key point to remember is that Garcias men are not in European competition this season primarily due to last seasons campaign ending early due to the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD Consequently they wont have the fatigue other clubs will face which will allow them to continuously compete at a high level PERIOD

As previously mentioned the likes of Depay midfielderHoussemAouar and forward KarlTokoEkambiwill simply be too much to handle for a Metz side that sits twelfth in the tableandthatis coming off a tough loss at home to StadeBrestois29 PERIOD

Now lets go over the two teams that are not even considered amateurs PERIOD In no way shape or form do they embody the shape of Rockybecause they simply do not have the experience to know what will be expected of them if they attempt to stay on pace with PSG PERIOD These two teams areMontpellier and Marseille PERIOD

The difference between this Marseille team and the three previous teams is not in the amount of title they have won PERIOD After all they have been crowned champions of the league a massive  times have been the Coupe de France  times and something Marseille fans never let Paris fans forget are the only French team to have ever won a Champions league defeating AC Milan in the  final PERIOD

All of this success is great but does recent history show this same amount of prestige Well the answer is a resounding no PERIOD This week Marseille finally broke their dismal record of  consecutive losses in the Champions league defeating Greek side Olympiacos F.C PERIOD  PERIOD Before that they had failed to score a goal or get a point in any of their previous  Champions League matches PERIOD As a result they were eliminated with two group stage games in hand PERIOD Although they were runnersup in the league last yearandwere Ligue  champions in  they simply do not have the X factor that teams like Lille Lyonnaisand Monacohave PERIOD

These three teams have been able to perform in Europe and have shown up in the league as well PERIOD The majority of Marseilles points have come from unconvincing lethargic draws which also makes me heavily question the fight in this club PERIOD For that reason I do not list them as an amateur but as an upandcoming PERIOD

Marseille kicks off Round  when they travel to the Stade DesCostieresand take onNmesOlympique on Friday Dec PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD The front three which is made up of winger Dimitri Payet winger FlorianThauvinand forward Daro Benedettocan be deadlykeywordscan be.They have proven to be wildly inconsistent which is why I cannot truly tout Andr VillasBoas attacking as being deadly PERIOD Still they have shown up in the past two games with all three scoring in their Round  victory over FC Nantesand Payet scoring twice in the teams victory over Olympiacos PERIOD If they can once again perform at this level on Friday it should be a convincing victory for LesOlympiens. finally Montpellier PERIOD This is a team that has won the league title only once in  and were last in the Champions league in  PERIOD As a result it should comeasnoonessurprise that one questions the legitimacy of their title challenge PERIOD Still they have had impressive results this season defeating Lyonnais in September and splitting the points with Monaco away from home in October PERIOD Moreover they have won all of their November fixtures in convincing fashion moreorless PERIOD

Nonetheless the club needs to show more if they wish to be taken seriously PERIOD Although that may sound harsh it is the truth PERIOD The team is set to face their toughest challenge yet when they welcome ParisSaint Germain to theStadedelaMossonon Saturday Dec PERIOD  at  p.m PERIOD Although MichelDerZakariansmen should not be judged incredibly harshly over how they perform against Francesrichest club  especially on the fact that they go into the contest with wind in their sails having just beat Manchester United away from home in the Champions League PERIOD Itcan give us a good grasp of the squads level based not only on how they perform but how they deal with the pressure PERIOD
