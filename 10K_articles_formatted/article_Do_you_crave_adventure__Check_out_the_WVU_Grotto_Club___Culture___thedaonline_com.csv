For the last  years the WVU Grotto Club has operated as a group of committed and passionate cavers PERIOD

We benefit from a long line of cavers in the community that have stuck around that love the state and its topography said Thomas Spotloe a junior geology major and the clubs social media coordinator PERIOD

Open to all majors the Grotto Club is a place where those that have an interest in caving and outside adventures can thrive PERIOD The club is also open to all skill levels PERIOD

At the beginning of each semester the club embarks on a weekend trip visiting a wellknown cave usually in West Virginia PERIOD This semesters trip had record participation numbers with over  students interested in learning about caving PERIOD

As the COVID19 pandemic affected the clubs abilities to go on trips and meet in person the trips during the last two years were conducted individually PERIOD However with the possibility of meeting in person this year the club is back and better than ever PERIOD

I think we handled COVID in a very remarkable way and I thought and we came out stronger in the way of our culture and stronger in the way of our membership than we could have expected to Spotloe said PERIOD

The club holds weekly meetings every Wednesday at  p.m PERIOD in Brooks Hall and hosts wall climbing sessions at WVUs Campus Recreation Center PERIOD

We have multiple trips going out every weekend which is new for us Spotloe said PERIOD

As club leaders are eager to educate members on professional aspects of caving and what life can be after the Grotto Club these weekly trips give students flexibility in their commitments to caving as they are not mandatory PERIOD

Big trips also happen every semester PERIOD Currently the club is gearing up to travel to Kentucky where members will be able to navigate the cave system and spend a week camping PERIOD

During spring break the club plans to visit the epicenter of caving in the United States located in the states Tennessee Alabama and Georgia PERIOD

Spotloe described the experience Having the opportunity to see and survey never before seen parts of the earth that are right here under your feet PERIOD And that is just something that no other club on campus can really claim. with only  in annual dues the Grotto Club is a great way for students to pursue their passions of adventure PERIOD

Those interested in the Grotto Club can find more information on Instagram wvustudentgrotto or keep an eye out for the staple orange caving sticker located on members cars water bottles or computers PERIOD
