Content Warning This editorial contains discussion of the death penalty and execution PERIOD

Two years after the April  Boston Marathon bombing Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has reached the sentencing phase of his trial but most of Massachusetts opposes the death penalty for him PERIOD Convicted on all  counts brought against him of which  carry a possible death sentence Tsarnaev faces either the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole PERIOD If the case were up to the state of Massachusetts Tsarnaev would not receive a death sentence PERIOD The death penalty is illegal in the state and only about a third of its residents approve of the death penalty for egregious crimes PERIOD Less than  percent of the state population believes that Tsarnaev should be executed and only  percent of Bostonians are in favor of his execution PERIOD

Even several victims of the bombing  including the parents of the 8yearold who was killed a couple who both lost limbs in the bombing and the sister of the slain MIT police officer  have spoken out against the death penalty for the bomber PERIOD

Rather the public prefers he receive a life sentence in a maximum security prison  a surprising and impressive fact given that Tsarnaev is responsible for an act of terror that killed four and injured  people PERIOD Unfortunately for Tsarnaevs fate the opinions of Massachusetts residents and even the states laws are irrelevant PERIOD The case is a federal matter and jurors in a federal court will determine his sentence PERIOD

Even if Tsarnaev is sentenced to death its likely that he might never be executed PERIOD Since the 1960s the federal government has only executed three people despite multiple death penalty sentences PERIOD A nationwide shortage of execution drugs combined with likely years of appeals in Tsarnaevs defense might result in Tsarnaev dying a natural death in prison before his execution date PERIOD

The controversy surrounding Tsarnaevs sentencing is emblematic of a larger debate on the death penalty and execution methods in the U.S PERIOD  especially surrounding the highly controversial method of lethal injection PERIOD On Wednesday the Supreme Court heard a case brought by three inmates against the state of Oklahoma about the use of the sedative midazolam in lethal injection PERIOD According to the argument brought by the inmates the sedative does not achieve the level of unconsciousness necessary for surgery and therefore violates the Eighth Amendment PERIOD

The Supreme Courts nine justices seemed to split along ideological lines on the constitutionality of the drug on Wednesday highlighting the deeper moral questions central to the death penalty debate PERIOD Wednesdays courtroom debate which was supposed to narrowly revolve only around the constitutionality of midazolam erupted into a debate over the death penalty so heated that Chief Justice John Roberts had to reprimand the justices for their rudeness toward the attorneys PERIOD The death penalty brought out the worst in the Supreme Court justices highlighting how visceral an issue it is even for those who are supposed to be the countrys most objective decision makers PERIOD

Among the debates in the Supreme Court was the availability of alternative execution methods PERIOD Lethal injection is the most botched execution method yet it is still the execution method of choice in the U.S PERIOD Between  and  . percent of lethal injections resulted in complications compared to gas chambers at . percent PERIOD In contrast among the  firing squad executions during that time there were no complications PERIOD But lethal injection is easier for us to stomach PERIOD It feels removed and humane in a way that other methods do not PERIOD There is something about directly killing another human being that makes even the staunchest death penalty supporters uncomfortable PERIOD

The controversy over which execution method is the most humane is not the heart of the death penalty debate and as nine impassioned justices demonstrated it is a thin veil over deeper moral questions PERIOD While six in ten Americans still approve of the death penalty  a statistic that has remained constant since   the number of people who favor the death penalty over life in prison with no possibility of parole has decreased PERIOD This change might stem from a growing realization that the determination of guilt and innocence in the justice system is far from perfect PERIOD With the emergence of breakthrough scientific technologies such as DNA testing many prisoners have been exonerated PERIOD It is nearly impossible to be completely certain that a suspect is guilty PERIOD Any amount of reasonable doubt is a valid reason to declare a stay of execution especially since there are so many inmates executed who are exonerated later in light of DNA evidence PERIOD Life in prison with no possibility of parole is a bleak punishment and some in that situation might even favor death but even the faintest hope of appeal makes it at least more reversible than the death penalty PERIOD

The common thread throughout the growing disapproval of the death penalty is uncertainty  uncertainty in how we execute individuals and more importantly why we do it in the first place PERIOD The recent controversy on the Supreme Court and the small number of Bostonians who support Tsarnaevs execution both suggest that Americans may finally be acknowledging the inherent inhumanity of the death penalty PERIOD
