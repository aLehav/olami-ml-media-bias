We write in response to the front page story Documents Detail Reported Violations by Greeks in the November  DA PERIOD The article which is punctuated throughout with factual errors and misrepresentations illustrates all too well why Phi Sigma Kappa and four other fraternities have elected to leave the Universitys loving embrace and form an Independent Interfraternity Council IIFC PERIOD

After first posting our interest in publishing editorials from the Greek life community mont

Regarding errors The WVU Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life OFSL underthe management of Matthew Richardson deliberately misled The Reaching the Summit Committee RTS and now through the DA its readers by presenting a laundry list of bulletstyle accusations as Violations and indicating that they occurred during the  academic year PERIOD

While the report does use a simple key to indicate that many if not most of the incidents were reported to be either the actions of an individual or without any responsible party at all this report fails to make it clear that most were determined to be false accusations or the action of one sole individual that was not representative of the fraternity not responsible PERIOD The report also did the RTS Committee members a disservice by failing to note that many of the charges dated back four years PERIOD

Mr PERIOD Serre should not feel too bad about his foray into Fake News PERIOD The rest of the story is a testimonial as to why the time had come for an Independent IFC PERIOD

The accusations in all their voluminous lack of detail was created and manipulated by Matthew Richardson and presented to the Reaching The Summit Committee as a Bill of Particulars demanding justice against evil organizations run amuck PERIOD The Committee can almost be forgiven for rushing to judgement without anything even remotely resembling due process for these student organizations and their members PERIOD

The Committee egged on by the ironicallynamed Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life declined to differentiate among legitimate violations baseless accusations and halftruths it embraced a theory of presumption of guilt in instances in which nobody was found responsible and it bought into the Universitys conjoined theories of guilt by association and the suggestion of some magical power by Greek organizations over the actions of individuals regardless of whether at a fraternity event downtown or in their dorm rooms PERIOD

Phi Sigma Kappa and the other now proudly independent fraternities oppose the Universitys efforts to conjure crimes where there are none and to assign blame to the innocent PERIOD This should not the be the role of an institution of higher education PERIOD The decline of the role of the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life from enhancing the experience of WVU students to that of a Keystone Kopsversion of the Thought Police is tragic PERIOD

Mr PERIOD Serres article plays perhaps unwittingly into the WVU Administrations destructive and narrow antiGreek mindset PERIOD There is a more important story to be told about student rights to freely associate without harassment PERIOD We along with the other fraternities of the Independent IFC look forward to the Athenaeums coverage of that story PERIOD
