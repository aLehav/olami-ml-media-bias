8735,2020-03-17,"spring term will be taught remotely to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus

Portland State will hold all courses either remotely or not at all starting spring term joining the communitywide effort to curb the COVID19 outbreak PERIOD



The decision was first announced in an email from PSU Interim President Stephen Percy one amid a neardaily slew of updates by the university to ensure students are informed PERIOD



Campus offices will remain open but PSU is urging campus events and gatherings to be held remotely whenever possible PERIOD The plans for teaching classes remotely will then be reevaluated in midApril with future guidance from health officials PERIOD



The threat of COVID19 is presenting daunting challenges for all of us Percy stated PERIOD We are committed to making decisions that promote the success and wellbeing of our campus community and growing concerns across Oregon. in another email update sent to university students and staff Percy released a video message listing PSUs priorities in responding to the outbreak protecting the health and wellbeing of PSUs community maintaining instruction so that students academic progress isnt disrupted and being a responsible community partner in helping to stop COVID19 PERIOD



Previously PSU planned to follow interim recommendations released by the Oregon Health Association on March  which urged schools not to close campuses where there were no confirmed cases of the virus and to consider all alternatives before closing a school college or university in the event that a COVID19 case is detected among students or staff. however as of March  The World Health Organization has officially named COVID19 a pandemic PERIOD



Since then Oregon Governor Kate Brown has banned any public gathering in the state of over  people and the next day ordered the closure of all public schools until March  PERIOD



PSU UO University of Oregon and OSU Oregon State University all decided this week to offer all classes remotely stated Chris Broderick the associate vice president for university communications PERIOD After state and local health officials and Gov PERIOD Brown made clear that the threat of the coronavirus spreading has grown and avoiding close inperson interactions reduces the risk of students and faculty contracting the virus. uO and OSU also decided to offer all spring courses remotely on Wednesday taking similar preventative measures as PSU PERIOD These include suspending all nonessential university travel canceling events of over  attendees and requiring that all winter term finals be taken remotely as well PERIOD



Among the departments preparing for and implementing changes in response to COVID19 is the Center for Student Health and Counseling SHAC the closest health clinic for many students especially those living in oncampus housing PERIOD



Theres a lot of anxiety said Mark Bajorek the director and a physician at SHAC Theres a lot of people with good intentions wanting to make sure they protect friends and families that are vulnerable PERIOD There are students that have medical concerns and want to make sure that they stay healthy and can complete their studies. as part of their response SHAC implemented a new screening process for everyone entering their office as soon as someone walks through the clinics doors they are greeted by a clinician ready with a thermometer and questions about their symptoms PERIOD



We started screening people for temperatures and then talking to them about their exposure factors and if they had a cough and a fever Bajorek explained PERIOD And if they did have a fever were routing them to a different entrance so we dont spread any virus through the clinic. other departments such as Campus Rec have opted to close entirely until further notice PERIOD



While there are still many unknowns surrounding the novel coronavirus what is known is how easily COVID19 spreads from person to person PERIOD In these cases where there is little known of the virus itself and a vaccine is not available before it becomes an outbreak the only and most effective way of slowing the spread of the disease is to prevent people from getting it in the first place according to the Center for Disease Control CDC PERIOD



I think thats the most important part of this virus is that its easily transmissibleevery virus has the capacity to cause damage said Carlos Crespo the vice provost and professor with OHSUPSU School of Public Health PERIOD This specific virus is very dangerous for a community because it spreads easily between community members. the CDC strongly recommends social distancing as an important step to limiting the spread of COVID19 where individuals stay at least six feet apart from one another and events of over  people are either canceled or postponed PERIOD



At the end of the day what we want is humans not to be in close contact with each other Crespo said PERIOD



However for many students there are as many unknowns regarding COVID19 and the schools response PERIOD In particular are the anxieties felt by student workers who are concerned that fewer hours working for the university may dramatically impact their ability to pay for their tuition PERIOD



Im kind of a little anxious explained Phay Kyaw a PSU student and student worker PERIOD I mean if the school is closed Im like will we be open If were not open I wont be able to work PERIOD If I wont be able to work yeah I can survive this term but if this continues on I might run out of money in my bank account to use to pay for my tuition. what I get from income from the school most of that money goes to my rent said Nayeli Naranjo who works for PSUs Game Room and Portland State Professional Sound PERIOD And then my other job off campus is that I work for venuesall Portland venues are shut down for the next  days PERIOD So yeah I dont really have any work for the next month. im fortunate enough that I dont have to pay for tuition because I have Four Years FreeBut I am worrying about paying for rent because I dont know if I will have enough money for that. other students are simply worried how remote learning will affect their class experience PERIOD



Im kind of bummed that we dont have class for like two weeks in the spring term because I dont get to see my friends and its going to be hard to have to do everything online said Ivy Clark a PSU student PERIOD Her friend William Britton agreed PERIOD



There is a lack of facetoface interaction and theres just kind of a feeling of isolation Britton said PERIOD Were encouraged to be socially distant when it comes to staying home PERIOD So it has its benefits but also its a little bit frightening because everythings shutting down. students who are relatively young will generally have an easier time fighting milder symptoms of the disease compared to higher risk groups such as the elderly according to Bajorek PERIOD For students who are immunosuppressedat a higher risk of experiencing worse symptoms if they are exposed to the viruswaiting for the school to hold classes remotely couldnt come quickly enough PERIOD



I have to be very proactive with my healthcare said Nicholas Lahusen a PSU student who is immunosuppressed due to medication PERIOD The outbreak has made me have to be quarantined at home an extra week and its made me have to communicate with my professors online which is not what I signed up for when I wanted to take my classes but if thats what I got to do thats what I got to do. unless people who are immunosuppressed are giving you the information theres no way that you would know PERIOD And once you do know its pretty much just a matter of being a little bit more proactive with your hand sanitizer coughing in your sleeve not spitting on people when you talk. as a global pandemic no one person will be able to stop the spread of COVID19 however there are still steps that every person can take that together can slow the novel coronavirus down PERIOD



The first step for individuals to combat COVID19 is to keep your hands clean and wash them often according to the CDC PERIOD Use hand sanitizer where sinks arent available and avoid touching your face PERIOD



Social distancing remains an important tool to reduce exposing healthy individuals to the virus whether it is first prompted by an organization cancelling events or a university hosting its courses remotely PERIOD This is especially important to remember once finals end and spring break begins when many students have planned to be especially social PERIOD



Really this will be the time to be thinking maybe I wont visit my grandparents over spring break or I should be thoughtful about exposing other people in my life that are  and older Bajorek said PERIOD Hang in there PERIOD Wash your handscover your cough PERIOD Think about try to work on social distancing. its hard to be socially distant because as animals were very social PERIOD And we depend on social interaction PERIOD And we need social support we need to build community Crespo said PERIOD



So while it may be impossible for an individual to stop COVID19 in their community a community that comes together to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus is exactly what doctors around the world have ordered PERIOD

I wish I knew who to contact regarding which classes will be cancelled PERIOD I feel PSU has not had effective communication regarding the classes being cancelled or done remotely PERIOD But to be fair it might be hard to reach  busy people PERIOD Right now Im relying on google for info on class information PERIOD Thanks Vanguard PERIOD Many students would be lost without local news reports PERIOD
