Distrust of the media has grown exponentially over the past couple of years many people refer to the media as being biased or spreading information that is inaccurate and unverified PERIOD This distrust has been extremely exacerbated by President Donald Trump PERIOD At the Conservative Political Action Conference in  Trump said A few days ago I called the fake news media the enemy of the people and they are PERIOD They are the enemy of the people. fake news has been a term circulated throughout the time that Trump has taken office PERIOD Prior to that I certainly do not recall people using that term and if they did it was not nearly as frequently used as it is today PERIOD Heck even when The Carroll News painted the Pacelli Lion last semester our masterpiece was defaced with the words fake news. the term has tainted the way people view media and the role of journalists in America PERIOD

Although I cannot say that I disagree with Trump on all fronts I do feel that the way he speaks especially towards members of the media is disrespectful PERIOD One of the biggest controversies as of late was with CNNs Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta PERIOD While Acosta was asking questions at a press conference Trump responded that he wanted to move on from Acosta to the next journalist because he was done answering Acostas questions PERIOD During this time a female intern tried to take the microphone to give to another journalist and was swatted away by Acosta PERIOD He tried to continue his questioning of the president and Trump responded with Thats enough put down the mic PERIOD CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them PERIOD You are a rude terrible person and you shouldnt be working for CNN. following this Acostas hard pass into the White House was revoked PERIOD Acosta tweeted Ive just been denied entrance to the WH PERIOD Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit. the next day Acosta sent out another tweet Dont believe the lies coming from the WH PERIOD Believe in our freedoms PERIOD Thank you all for your support PERIOD We wont back down. i will not say that I agree with Acosta continuously speaking over the president after he had said he wanted to move forward PERIOD Yet from the perspective of a journalist I completely feel the frustration of not being able to get important questions answered and being treated in a rude way for doing your job PERIOD

This one example on a national scale displays how difficult it is for journalists to do their jobs and the backlash they have to face while reporting PERIOD However these types of situations arise all too often for journalists at all levels PERIOD

As an intern at cleveland.com I observe my coworkers preparing stories talking to sources and getting information PERIOD One story that I knew was going to be incredible was written by Seth Richardson a wellrespected political reporter PERIOD His story focused on discord within the Ohio Democratic Party and how this strife could possibly lead to change in leadership of the party PERIOD When the story was posted Richardson immediately received negative comments about his reporting PERIOD

A tweet by Lessa Brown stated Speaking as a former flack Ive seen few if any hit pieces like this allowed to get through editing w so many unnamed sources who are cowardly manipulative divisive meanspirited and attempting to escape responsibility PERIOD Youve been used. although Richardson had used various unnamed sources in the story both he and his editor knew that these sources were very reputable and credible making them both comfortable to publish the story without revealing the identities of those being quoted PERIOD

Another example of a reporter who faces hardships in the industry is Julie Hullett a recent JCU grad former Managing Editor and a good friend of mine PERIOD She began her journey as a professional journalist a few months ago and shared her thoughts with me The learning curve has definitely been steep PERIOD I came out of college thinking that I was very experienced and knew how to be a journalist but the real world is different and I am learning something new every day PERIOD Whether its working my way through complicated legislation or fighting for my right to listen to a public meeting being a young journalist is difficult but exciting. although the media has taken on a negative connotation over the years I will stand by my fellow journalists and continue to be proud of the hard work and dedication we bring to our publications PERIOD Am I willing to say that there arent any news organizations spreading falsehoods and tricking the public No PERIOD What I am saying is that there are plenty more news organizations and journalists who work extremely hard to expose the truth and help get information out into the world PERIOD

As a student journalist I look forward to the days where I will be out in the world reporting on real issues facing America PERIOD
