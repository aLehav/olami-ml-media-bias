A Swifties analysis of  Taylors Version

The English language is a precious entity PERIOD The proper use of the language is praised although the abuse of it has become the norm in American society PERIOD

Technology has brought along textspeak which can be described as lazy English PERIOD But is textspeak really abuse or is it merely one of the many American dialects Our country is so diverse and although we mostly speak the same language our language is just as colorful as our culture PERIOD

Regionalisms words associated with different regions are a perfect example of how English neednt be homogeneous to be correct PERIOD One example of this is that people in more northern regions call carbonated drinks pop. some areas call it tonic. of course thats all just silly because Texans know that its called soda. we may call a friend dude while other regions may call a friend bro no matter the gender PERIOD We say awesome just as frequently as people from Boston say boss or wicked and we all mean the same thing PERIOD If you lived further west you wouldnt be horrified to hear that your grandparents were wearing thongs because you would know that they would be wearing flipflops. regionalisms put unique flavor into the mix of American English PERIOD They are something to be proud of they represent your roots PERIOD

Sometimes regionalisms fill in holes in proper English PERIOD For example without the use of a regionalism can you think of the plural form of the secondperson pronoun In other words the proper plural form of you

According to writer Mignon Fogarty better known as Grammar Girl fourteenth century English didnt have this problem PERIOD As a secondperson subject the singular form was thou while the plural form was ye. as the object of a sentence the singular form was thee while the plural form was you. in the English of today its all you. subject object singular plural you PERIOD That gets confusing PERIOD If youre talking to a group of people and you refer to them as you the pronoun would most likely be followed by all for clarification PERIOD Its sad that over time the English language dropped ye which seems to be an important pronoun PERIOD

Thats where regionalisms come in PERIOD

Southerners say yall. its not grammatically incorrect especially if said in this region PERIOD Variants of this word include youse you guys yuuns ye yins and you lot. again silly Yankees why ignore the most logical thing Yall is the contraction of you and all. english loves contractions PERIOD Formal English should embrace yall as the newest replacement of our lost pronoun PERIOD Anyway formal documents and speeches can do well with a little bit of Southern charm yall PERIOD
