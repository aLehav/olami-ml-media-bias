Playing its second consecutive road game against a nationally ranked opponent the No PERIOD  Stony Brook womens lacrosse team had a chance to earn backtoback statement wins in its pursuit of an atlarge bid to the NCAA Tournament PERIOD

The trip to Evanston Illinois proved daunting as the Seawolves fell  to the No PERIOD  Northwestern Wildcats on Thursday March  in a game where they never led PERIOD

Stony Brook  has played three highlyranked opponents to start its season losing by one goal to No PERIOD  Syracuse and withstanding a late rally to squeak past No PERIOD  Florida by one PERIOD However the contest against Northwestern  was not nearly as competitive as the Wildcats raced out to an early lead and never looked back PERIOD

The Wildcats ball movement was something to admire on Thursday as  of their  goals were assisted and three of the remaining four came on free position shots PERIOD Led by attacker Erin Coykendalls nine points off four goals and five assists Northwestern held a sevengoal advantage with nine minutes left in the game and quelled any momentum for a secondhalf Stony Brook comeback PERIOD



Northwestern did so with attacker Lauren Gilbert tied for the sixthmost goals in the country not finding the scoreboard although she did record four assists PERIOD

Stony Brook was held scoreless for the first  minutes of the game until midfielder Siobhan Rafferty cut the deficit to  on a manup opportunity PERIOD Before the end of the first quarter midfielder Ellie Maseras rapidfire behindtheback goal made it  and she added a free position goal to make it a onescore game early in the second PERIOD

Then Northwestern pulled away pouring on five in a row to go up  PERIOD Starting goalkeeper Charlie Campbell was yanked from the game after halftime having recorded just two saves for a . save percentage despite entering with a . rate on the season PERIOD Kameron Halsall who started  straight games at goalie for Stony Brook in the two seasons prior took over in the cage for the second half allowing seven goals against three saves PERIOD

Masera assisted midfielder Rayna Sabella for the opening score of the second half cutting Stony Brooks deficit to four goals PERIOD Northwestern immediately dealt a devastating blow to the Seawolves spirits by racking up three straight goals in three minutes including a pair in  seconds to open up its largest lead of the night PERIOD

The Seawolves scored four of the games last five goals to make the final score look more competitive but the outcome appeared long predestined with the clock running against them PERIOD There was not enough time to crawl back from the gap that Northwestern dug them into PERIOD In the first three quarters the Wildcats dominated draw controls  against the Seawolves a key factor in their victory PERIOD

Masera led the way for Stony Brook with five goals and Sabella also had a hat trick PERIOD

The Seawolves face their thirdstraight ranked opponent on Sunday when No PERIOD  Johns Hopkins comes to Kenneth P PERIOD LaValle Stadium at  p.m PERIOD
