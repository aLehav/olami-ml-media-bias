So lemme tell you this PERIOD Jolly Ranchers are a great candy PERIOD There is not one flavor that tastes bad they are all delicious especially the green apple flavor PERIOD But that is kind of where I ran into some problems PERIOD

When I was in about third grade I remember that we would get prizes for finishing books in a week from the library PERIOD Once a week our class would go and we would check out books PERIOD Typical stuff PERIOD

If you finished the book you read in that week you would get to pick a prize PERIOD I always had a sweet tooth and chose the candy that Ms PERIOD Finger had that day PERIOD That was her name PERIOD She took some heat for it PERIOD

So on this particular day I chose to pick out what was my favorite candy at the time the green apple Jolly Rancher PERIOD

Now me being a kid and not really thinking too much about consequences I decided to bite down on the Jolly Rancher PERIOD That is where my day went up in flames PERIOD

The delicious Jolly Rancher got stuck to my tooth and it would not get unstuck PERIOD I got a little freaked out because we were not allowed to eat our candy in class PERIOD

At this point I am freaking out a little bit because I did not want to get in trouble PERIOD I could not go to class with this Jolly Rancher stuck to my tooth or else I would get a step. that was what my school called getting in trouble PERIOD If you got so many it would add up to a detention PERIOD Thinking back what I did this day was definitely not worth it PERIOD I should have just taken the step PERIOD

So before my class had to go back to our classroom I went to the bathroom to try to get this Jolly Rancher off my tooth PERIOD I thought maybe I could just pull it off my tooth PERIOD I mean this thing was really stuck to my tooth PERIOD

So I pulled really hard to get the Jolly Rancher off my tooth and then I heard a little crackle I thought I was close PERIOD So I kept pulling and pulling and then it came off PERIOD The big problem was that I pulled out my tooth with it PERIOD This tooth was not loose and I was bleeding like I never could have imagined PERIOD

At this point my time is running out PERIOD I had to get back and now my mouth was filled with blood and I was holding what was recently a rooted tooth in my hand PERIOD So then I had to deal with the blood gushing out of my mouth and also make it to class PERIOD

Well to sum it up I was late getting back to class and had to explain why I was bleeding the way I was PERIOD It was one of the worst days of third grade PERIOD

So my lesson to you is to not eat candy in class when you are not supposed to and to also not pull on a Jolly Rancher that is stuck to your tooth PERIOD At this point you do not have an incoming adult tooth to fall back on PERIOD If you lose that you are screwed PERIOD
