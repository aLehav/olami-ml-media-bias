6033,2023-11-04,"a free and responsible press serving the UMass community since 

After one of the first practices of the season the Massachusetts womens basketball team headed into the locker room to get changed when a simple threeword message on the white board turned everyones heads PERIOD

We will win. those three words were written across the board just as boldly and confidently as head coach Tory Verdi took on his new position in the UMass basketball program PERIOD

There is a newfound excitement and anticipation for the upcoming  season PERIOD Most of it stems from the amount of positive attention Verdi has attracted PERIOD But the question still remains What is there left to do with a team which has struggled season after season

The road to Amherst

The Minutewomen have had just seven winning seasons in the last  years and only one since a winning surge that occurred under Joannie OBrien who led the Minutewomen to five consecutive winning seasons from  PERIOD

OBriens era would mark the last consistent success the program has seen PERIOD Since then the University has employed four different athletic directors and as of April  three different coaches PERIOD

Expectations will be on the rise PERIOD Accountability will be apparent and a winning attitude will be instilled Verdi said in his introductory press conference at the John F PERIOD Kennedy Champions Center on April  PERIOD

Verdi arrived at UMass after spending four seasons at Eastern Michigan where he accumulated a record of  PERIOD Much like the Minutewomen EMU was a program in the making and Verdi produced substantial improvement in the team that showed in their record shattering  season PERIOD

After going  in his first season with the Eagles Verdi turned the program around and led the Eagles to two womens National Invitation Tournament appearances and the MidAmerican Conference championship game in  PERIOD

The New Britain Connecticut native prioritized a hightempo offense to which the team responded by scoring  points the thirdmost in a single season in school history PERIOD The Eagles also dished out  assists that year ranking seventh overall in program history PERIOD

Verdi leaves the Eagles program having rewritten the record book with  different alltime top performances The most points in a season  field goals made  rebounds  and threepointers made  PERIOD

Before EMU Verdi spent the   and  seasons on staff with the WNBAs Connecticut Sun reaching the postseason each year PERIOD In addition he spent the  collegiate season with Columbia University as their top assistant and eventual interim head coach PERIOD

Where we are right now its a little bit of a rebuilding project Verdi said Im excited about the challenges that lie ahead and Im really excited about the players that we have in the program right now and where were going. it wasnt long ago though that former coach Sharon Dawley seemed just as promising as Verdi sharing his impressive reputation and track record of being a program rebuilder. both also had made trips to the postseason in the previous two seasons before being hired by UMass PERIOD

But Dawley never won more than  games in a single season throughout her six years with the Minutewomen finishing her career at UMass with a  record PERIOD

This team averaged  points per game and only won  games last year Verdi said in an interview after the teams first exhibition game of the season PERIOD But that was last year were talking about this year. working with what hes got

Verdi knows change isnt going to happen instantaneously and instead is only focusing on what lies ahead PERIOD

Repeatedly Verdi acknowledged how hard his players work in practice day after day giving him  percent effort every single time PERIOD

I just told them I said anything is possible we just have to stick together and believe in one another Verdi said PERIOD If we do that we can move mountains together. the first fulltime male coach in UMass womens basketball history views his transition to UMass as a rather smooth one apart from the fact that hes coming from a full team at EMU to a team with only six healthy bodies with the season starting Friday PERIOD

Players expressed their concern about the lack of healthy bodies because of the toll it has taken on them physically PERIOD The Minutewomen now are facing the struggle during practice of not having enough players to execute drills in their entirety PERIOD

Regardless of how many players he has Verdis appreciation for them and the hard work theyve showed him has not faltered PERIOD His outlook has proven to be infectious with his players looking at the season in front of them optimistically and only hoping to do their absolute best PERIOD

I think he already has made a difference junior guard Leah McDerment said PERIOD Its a completely different culture here now. the prominent differences that Verdi has instilled in the program is also apparent to McDerments cocaptain junior Maggie Mulligan as well as sophomore returner Jessica George PERIOD

Were growing George said PERIOD Every practice we get better. mulligan explained Verdis coaching style as much stricter than what shes used to but believes it is exactly what UMass needed PERIOD The 6foot2 forward commended the way hes been able to pull their six healthy players together PERIOD

Faith in ourselves Mulligan said in response to what she believes the team needs the most at this point in time PERIOD As long as we believe in ourselves I think were going to go far. verdi admitted that hes approached this team differently than he has with others but the kind of team he hopes to put together has not changed PERIOD

Were going to put a team out on the floor whos going to be really prepared theyre going to know their opponents theyre going to know personnel theyre going to know what the other team does offensively and defensively Verdi said PERIOD

He added Were going to go out there and try and win every single game. the New Britain Sports Hall of Famer thinks the most important thing his team needs is leadership PERIOD Taking into account the fact that theyre playing a lot of young players at the moment starting two freshmen and a sophomore who received little playing time last year the team needs a leader PERIOD

The second thing his team needs Toughness PERIOD

When you face adversity youve got to come together and lots of times when teams face adversity they implode Verdi said PERIOD Our players understand that we expect them to come together and be tough. all in all Verdi hopes to change the expectations of this program PERIOD

The reason why I took this job is to catapult this program into the top  in the country Verdi said with  years of experience supporting his statement PERIOD

Were going to do that PERIOD Its a process but thats our ultimate goal. mollie Walker can be reached at emailprotected and followed on Twitter at MWalker2019 PERIOD
