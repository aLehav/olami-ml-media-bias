By Samantha Boyle Managing Editor for Reporting October  

No criminal charges have been filed against any individuals in connection with incidents that happened outside of Rogue Barber Shop during a protest over the summer PERIOD

Champaign County States Attorney Julia Rietz informed the city on Oct PERIOD  that the pickup truck driver who drove through a small protest on July  will not face any criminal charges PERIOD In addition after four police reports were submitted regarding vandalism and threats to the barber shop and its owner the States Attorney Office did not file charges against any individuals for the alleged vandalism or threats PERIOD

Rogue Barber Shop located on  E PERIOD Washington St. then closed on Aug PERIOD  after only being open for nine months PERIOD

According to a Champaign press release the States Attorneys Office declined to file charges against the truck driver for several reasons The driver was driving slowly away from the scene one protestor put his bike in the way of the truck and other protestors put themselves in front of the truck pounding on it or converging on it instead of moving away from it PERIOD

I am declining to file state criminal charges with regards to any of the situations Rietz said to Champaign Police on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD Champaign City Legal is welcome to consider ordinance violations as may be appropriate. during the July protests Rogue Barber Shop had been the subject of criticism and the site of Black Lives Matter protests after a Facebook post made by the business in July stated it was now going to be a private membership not unisex and would require members to fill out an application the NewsGazette reported PERIOD Many have criticized the post as being discriminatory and the post has since been deleted PERIOD

Police conducted several interviews examined thirdparty videos and analyzed additional evidence to then turn over to the Champaign County States Attorneys Office on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD
