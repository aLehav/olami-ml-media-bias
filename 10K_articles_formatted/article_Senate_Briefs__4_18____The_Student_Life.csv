We were unable to put the Senate Briefs in the last weeks printed version PERIOD Please visit our website if you would like to read them tsl.pomona.edu PERIOD



Same Ol Story

Continuing the tradition of his predecessor next years ASPC President Nate Brown  showed up late to his first Senate meeting after being elected PERIOD His namesake Environmental Affairs Commissioner Nate Wilairat  reported to the Senate on the Facebook group petitioning to turn the hammer throw field into part of the Organic Farm PERIOD Wilairat wanted to clarify a few things before people start getting outraged and explained that the point of the petition is to show that there are students who are interested in considering alterative uses for the space not to advocate that we kick out athletics without finding them a suitable alternative or replacement field PERIOD Just as Wilairat was finishing up South Campus Representative Ian Gallogly  rolled up outside the meeting on his longboard and slipped on the wet concrete PERIOD The Senate erupted in laughter as Gallogly entered leaving current ASPC President Stephanie Almeida  displeased and banging her gavel in anger PERIOD Senior Class President Meredith Willis  aptly added Youre watching your empire crumble Stephanie. joseph Long  OCL

For the third time this semester Long exited the Senate meeting to a round of applause and a rare smile from Associate Dean of Students Neil Gerard PERIOD What garnered that acclaim was Longs presentation of a new room reviews website which despite not being public yet people have started using Long told Senate PERIOD The Room Review site discussed on and off for two years now offers students the ability to browse housing options search for rooms based on certain specifications particular dorms room size etc and review rooms PERIOD The site even has maps and specs of both new dormsSontag and Building Bwhich OCL has not put up on the Pomona College website yet PERIOD Several Senators were concerned that incoming firstyears might complain about their rooms before getting to campus and create a big scene but Long assured them that he could easily cut out incoming firstyears until they got to campus PERIOD Others worried that the maps may not accurately reflect the most uptodate friendship suite locations or substancefree rooms PERIOD At least this website even exists and lets all realize that Long can easily add a disclaimer on the leadin page saying that it is not official College content PERIOD



Im Looking at YOU Frank Langan

Next Willis discussed a few ideas for the Senior Class Project PERIOD Her first idea was to do a SeniorsHelpingSeniors Day with a few senior citizen homes in the village since you know were all getting old as she put it PERIOD The Senior Class Committee is also considering hosting a Senior Class event to write letters to middle schoolers to encourage them to go to college or in Williss words to keep on keeping on. lastly Willis reported that the Senior Class Gift has received donations from around  percent of the class which is higher than this time last year PERIOD She quickly added So if you havent given Frank Langan you should probably give. this year alumni giving is at its lowest level in a while so its really important that people give a dollar Frank Langan. every dollar up to  that seniors put toward the gift will be matched by Dean Feldblums office so make sure you give at least a dollar Frank Langan PERIOD



The Best Elections Commissioner Ever

Lastly ASPC Elections Commissioner Aerienne Russell  visited the Senate to talk about how the election process could be improved in the future PERIOD First she noted that there was some confusion about candidates names on the ballot PERIOD Some candidates go by something other than their legal names so if someone wants to be called Starfish  she said they need to let the elections commissioner know in advance PERIOD After a few other brief discussions the Senate moved onto a conversation about whether or not ASPCfunded organizations are allowed to send out emails endorsing candidates and explicitly telling members of a group who to vote for PERIOD This of course refers to the email sent by a member of Empowered Latinos in Action ELA and passed along to several different ASPCfunded groups on campus PERIOD After a heated debate a subcommittee was formed to draft language on the matter PERIOD Lets hope this one doesnt get dissolved like all the other Senate subcommittees so that this isnt an issue in the future PERIOD
