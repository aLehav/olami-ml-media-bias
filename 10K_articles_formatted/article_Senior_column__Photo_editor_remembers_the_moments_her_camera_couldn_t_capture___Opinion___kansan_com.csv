Photo editor Missy Minear has been on the Kansan photo staff for four years PERIOD Ahead of her graduation she writes a farewell column about her time at the Kansan PERIOD

This senior column has been in the back of my mind for months PERIOD Ive been dreading the task of actually writing something for the Kansan but more so Ive been dreading saying goodbye to what has been my life for four years PERIOD

I started photography in high school PERIOD I wasnt good enough to play on the varsity basketball team so I shot their games instead PERIOD At the time I thought those photos were great PERIOD Looking back theyre terrible and I hope nobody ever sees them again PERIOD But as a senior in high school heading to the University of Kansas in August shooting Kansas basketball was the dream PERIOD

Fast forward four years and Im sitting on the baseline at the Final Four in San Antonio PERIOD Im among photographers shooting for Sports Illustrated and Getty Images PERIOD The best of the best PERIOD

The dream came true PERIOD

I was at a Final Four PERIOD

The game didnt go the way we had hoped but the experience was everything I had dreamed of PERIOD

Ive shot countless basketball games football games baseball games and so on PERIOD Some games stand out PERIOD Like Frank Mason III hitting a shot in the final seconds to defeat Duke at Madison Square Garden in New York City in  PERIOD Many of the games blend together PERIOD But I dont take any of them for granted PERIOD

I have the Kansan to thank for so much PERIOD It has given me so many opportunities I wouldnt have had without it PERIOD Ive had the opportunity to travel to new places meet amazing photographers and do what I love PERIOD

Many of the memories I have of the Kansan are on the sidelines with a camera in my hand but even more of them will be from the countless hours spent in the newsroom with the incredible people that Ive had the opportunity to work with PERIOD I work with my best friends PERIOD

Ill never forget annoying everyone in the newsroom by hanging a small hoop in the corner and throwing whatever I can find at it special thanks to those that would play with me PERIOD Ill never forget our tedious planning of our next trip to the Cielitos patio PERIOD Ill never forget dragging the reporters to a childrens museum in Wichita during the first weekend of the NCAA tournament this year PERIOD

Ill never forget the friendships Ive made PERIOD I wouldnt be where I am without the friendship and constant support Ive received from all of them PERIOD

After graduation Im heading to Bloomington Indiana to be a photo intern at Indiana Athletics PERIOD And I owe it all to the Kansan and the amazing people PERIOD

But before I move on from KU I had to remember my time with the Kansan in the best way I know how a gallery of some of my favorite shots PERIOD
