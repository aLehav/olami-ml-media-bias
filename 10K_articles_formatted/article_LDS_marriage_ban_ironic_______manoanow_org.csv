MCT Campus  Brandon Ross of Auburn holds an American flag aloft
during a gay rights rally protesting the passage of Californias
Proposition  on Saturday Nov PERIOD   in Sacramento Calif PERIOD

Californias Proposition  passed in last Novembers election
was the Rights latest attack on freedom and equality asserting
the legal definition of marriage as between one man and one
woman PERIOD

Whats particular ironic is that the leaders of the Utahbased
Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints issued a formal request
to be read in congregations to  Church members responded with a massive campaign that
included donating a large portion of raised funds and going door to
door to support the amendment PERIOD

In the past the LDS church has asserted their reluctance to
formally enter into political debates PERIOD One of the requirements for
active membership is a profession of faith that these same leaders
speak directly on behalf of God PERIOD Such power can be easily abused PERIOD
When a church begins actively calling for a public policy change
that affects the lives of millions it invites criticism of its
motives history and its ability to persuade its adherents PERIOD

With the inconsistencies in their behavior and the sharp irony
they sometimes produce humans never fail to astonish PERIOD And as
founder of Mormonism Joseph Smith once said  No matter
what people cant leave other people alone PERIOD

The United States was founded by people who wanted equality for
all white men and religious freedom for themselves PERIOD We havent yet
learned that you cant have freedom without sharing it PERIOD These same
Christians immediately resorted to persecution and attempted
extermination of Latterday Saints atrocities that although
staggering are largely overlooked in our history PERIOD

For its belief that the government could not enforce a
definition of marriage as one man and one woman among other
liberties the LDS church was driven from the country to what is
now Utah but was then part of Mexico PERIOD Even then the U.S PERIOD
government sent armies to prevent them from practicing polygamy
even seizing all their assets and disincorporating the church for a
time PERIOD

However the LDS church cant take on the role of an oppressed
minority that merely wishes to practice its beliefs in peace if
they go on to oppress others once the roles are reversed PERIOD From
strict control over its membership to culturally damaging and
oppressive missionary efforts in the Pacific Islands and throughout
the world to the modern culture wars they have shown a pattern of
forcing their values and opinions on people PERIOD They no longer need
the oppressed role anymore as the church has become one of the
largest stakeholders in the U.S PERIOD

The practice most found objectionable under Brigham Youngs
leadership and which was decried against by every other
denomination of Mormonism was not so much polygamy but the
practice of  or polyandry PERIOD Under this system the
highest leaders of the church could  marry women who
were already legally married to living men PERIOD This spiritual marriage
then gave said leaders sexual rights to other mens wives PERIOD Failure
to comply resulted in persecution and excommunication while
cooperation ensured blessings PERIOD Not even King David enjoyed such
power PERIOD

Is it not ironic that the descendants of this legacy are now
championing rightwing conservative values on marriage Whats even
more ironic is that using the law to limit freedom is in itself in
opposition to LDS doctrine PERIOD

According to Mormon mythology a war was fought in heaven over
the topic of freedom PERIOD Lucifer proclaimed that if chosen to be the
Messiah he would govern the people according to strict rules so
that not one soul would be able to sin and go to hell PERIOD Total peace
would reign on earth PERIOD Jesus plan on the other hand ensured that
war crime poverty greed corruption and wickedness would reign
on earth but that more importantly people would be free to choose
between good and evil PERIOD Though many would be lost the ones who
remained faithful in spite of these circumstances would have proven
themselves worthy of exalted glory PERIOD

That is a great basis for a doctrine of separation of church and
state but unfortunately Latterday Saints policies do not reflect
their beliefs PERIOD By giving in to paranoid views that Gods ordained
system of marriage and family is under attack they and other
Christians have shown a tremendous lack of faith in God doubting
Josephs revelation that 

Far from revealing the timeless truths of God the doctrines of
the LDS church have been blown to and fro by every wind of social
change always reflecting the views of its leadership from Joseph
Smiths liberal and communist views to Brigham Youngs prophesy of
the downfall of America to the more modern leaders embrace of
capitalism patriotism and conservative values PERIOD It is time that
people stop placing blind faith in human beings and instead utilize
their own powers of reason and seek to embrace love and human
goodness PERIOD

Or as Joseph Smith wrote
