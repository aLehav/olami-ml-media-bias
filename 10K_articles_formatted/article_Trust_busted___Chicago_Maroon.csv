Im a fucking steamroller and Ill roll over you and anybody else.Gov PERIOD Eliot Spitzer January 

Winner of the biggest electoral landslide in state history Eliot Spitzer came to Albany with the reputation for reform rightly earned after serving as one of the most successful Attorney Generals in recent times PERIOD His star was among the brightest in the Democratic Party behind maybe only Barack Obama whom my friends and I envisioned as a dream ticket as early as four years ago.His first year in office was tumultuous at best disastrous at worst PERIOD He picked a public feud with the Republican Senate President see above quote employed bullying tactics to demean his critics and alienated much of his once overwhelming support PERIOD With three years left in the governors mansion however there was still time to make things right PERIOD That is until today when it all came tumbling down.In a story that will leave Spitzerfoe the New York Post salivating for weeks my headline suggestion Trustbusted the Governor has been implicated in a prostitution ring and will resign PERIOD Rarely in American politics has a rise and fall been so pronounced PERIOD
