The first thing you are taught as a journalist is that ethics matter PERIOD Not only do they matter but they always come first PERIOD It separates the news from the tabloids PERIOD It is the reason people trust us believe in us and act on what we say PERIOD

Unfortunately according to Ron Smith author of Ethics in Journalism The reputation of journalists is continually being questioned PERIOD Nearly every public opinion poll shows that people have lost respect for journalists and lost faith in the news media. this statement is not something that future journalists want to hear so why is it according to Smith the status quo

Have we as journalists lost the sense of ethics that those in our place generations before cherished so much Are ethics so far out the door that even those not in the public eye will eventually see their lives become public information Everyones lives have become the worlds business and it has become a luxury to be unGoogleable

With the race to be the first to break the news journalistsattimes have started to lower their standards for sources information or accuracy PERIOD After all it isnt news if it isnt new and if it isnt news then you dont make money right But at what point did we start to put money over ethics

Early last week an anonymous hacker broke into both former President George Bushs and President George W PERIOD Bushs email accounts and sent personal addresses emails numbers pictures and information to The Smoking Gun a news website that posts legal documents arrest records and police mug shots on a daily basis PERIOD Most of their information is obtained from the Freedom of Information Act FOIA and is published on their site to bring light to situations that might miss the mainstream media PERIOD

After receiving the information the website made the decision to publish some of the photos and emails that came from the hacker PERIOD One must ask was that necessary and was it even ethical for The Smoking Gun Was it important for the people in our country to know that President George W PERIOD Bush has picked up painting as a new hobby

The answer to all of those is no PERIOD

When thinking of leaks and hacked information some people might question the publication of the Pentagon Papers by newspapers PERIOD These papers discussed the political and military involvement in Vietnam between the 1940s and 1960s PERIOD The papers showed that the U.S PERIOD had expanded its war with bombings and coastal raids on purpose none of which was previously reported by the media PERIOD The papers also showed that the administrations that were in office misled the people PERIOD

However there is a difference between publishing the Pentagon Papers and the emails from George W PERIOD Bush PERIOD The Pentagon Papers affected the good of the American people and our government while the Bush emails were barely even newsworthy for the smallest news networks PERIOD

Paintings by Bush do not affect our foreign policy our budget or our nation PERIOD

Sure the fact that two presidents had their emails hacked is important news PERIOD What isnt news are the paintings the emails and the information the website published PERIOD It isnt just The Smoking Gun at fault hereother papers linked back to the artwork and emails that were originally put online some even published them themselves PERIOD Paintings pictures and quotes werent necessary to inform the audience of what happened PERIOD They are necessary for attention though PERIOD It gave the news industry clicks to their pages and it boosted the number of readers that read the article therefore boosting the revenue to their company PERIOD

So we come back to the main point here morals versus money PERIOD

Have journalists lost the desire to break news for the moral purpose of informing the people Are they just obsessed with their byline and the money

At one point in time journalism was about letting the people know what was happening PERIOD Journalists worked to make sure they informed the public about events happening all over the world PERIOD They saw it as their duty their obligation and their job PERIOD

As an aspiring journalist I believe that a large number of journalists still fall into this category PERIOD There are people out there who still report news for this reason but its getting tougher and tougher as more tabloids become news headlines PERIOD

The methods of journalism are constantly evolving but the basic rules and ethics have always and must always remain the same PERIOD

Live tweeting has become the new way of breaking news so the next day the headlines on The New York Times are no longer new news therefore less people are likely to pick it up PERIOD

It is getting harder for journalists to break news papers to publish and people to trust the media PERIOD

I know it may be hard for the public to believe but it is pretty obvious that people who sign on to be a journalist dont do it for the moneythey do it because they love to write they love deadlines or they want to inform the people of what they dont already know PERIOD

I know it might be hard but dont lose faith in us just yet PERIOD",Evolving society questions ethics of journalistic methods â€“ The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
