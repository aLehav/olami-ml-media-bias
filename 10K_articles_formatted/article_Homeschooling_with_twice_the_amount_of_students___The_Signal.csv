8816,2023-11-05,"elementary school shutdowns in Atlanta will require parents to assist their kids with the new online learning systems PERIOD

Georgia State alumna Leah Longoria is a high school English teacher and a mother of three PERIOD Because of this shes essentially handling two education jobs at once PERIOD The balance between the two brings challenges leading Longoria to become overwhelmed PERIOD

It is becoming a lot to handle Longoria said PERIOD I was not expecting the virus quarantine to last this long. longoria teaches at Mount Pisgah Christian School which announced its campus closure on March  PERIOD All three of her children attend the elementary and preschool as well PERIOD The two elementary schoolers need separate computers or tablets for classes PERIOD

We quickly had to gather all of our electronics and figure out the demands of each class she said PERIOD The teachers are accommodating to technical issues but the time management for each class is a challenge. during the first few days of quarantine Longoria set a schedule for each kid starting first thing in the morning to bedtime PERIOD The schedule maintains the same routine as if the kids were still at school PERIOD

It is important that we keep a schedule because everyone has a specific routine during normal times she said PERIOD

The main issues for Longoria are caused by her high school students and their focus during online class periods PERIOD With the new technology and systems Longoria said her 16yearold students are finding new ways to defy school rules PERIOD

Many students simply stopped attending the Zoom sessions PERIOD Longoria has seen up to three absences since the campus closure PERIOD Students arent just missing class theyre also missing deadlines for assignments daily PERIOD

I understand technical difficulties she said PERIOD The missed turnin times do not make sense because the times were the same as before in regular classes. longoria said she has become more lenient on enforcement for regular infractions PERIOD The climate of the constant COVID19 updates is overwhelming for students and teachers PERIOD Students who are close to her expressed the need for guidance in an unprecedented time PERIOD

I want them to feel relaxed as possible while we get through this weird time she said PERIOD Many school events that are important to teens in a way saddens them and many are missing some of their last high school memories. longoria hopes that schools will allow students of all ages to see each other once the school doors are opened once again PERIOD
