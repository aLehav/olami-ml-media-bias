CCMs Metamorphoses combines works of the Roman poet Ovid into one and sets them on a watery stage PERIOD It runs February fifty-ninth in the Patricia Corbett Theater PERIOD The News RecordLauren Kremer

Roman poet Ovids Metamorphoses contains more than  classic tales and the Mary Zimmerman play by the same name might have one or two PERIOD

Though these stories have stood the test of time they dont exactly make for a riveting theatrical production PERIOD

The CollegeConservatory of Music mounted this ambitious performance and even went as far as to create the 3000gallon pool needed for the show PERIOD

Guest director D PERIOD Lynn Meyers took full advantage of the technical staff at CCM PERIOD Lighting director Wes Richter and set designer Dana Hall are the true heroes of these tales PERIOD Their brilliance is most captivating element of Metamorphoses. king Midas John Odom wished that everything he touched would turn to gold PERIOD So when he walked around the stage each step was illuminated in gold by the lights PERIOD

The blocking had to be challenging considering the landscape or lack there of but Meyers did a fantastic job PERIOD

The story of Alcyone Bailie Breux and Ceyx Christian Carey is particularly well put together PERIOD Alycone has a premonition that her husband is going to die at sea during his next journey PERIOD Shes right and at the end she turns into a bird  or something PERIOD But the story isnt the interesting part PERIOD The shipwreck itself is visually stunning PERIOD Poseidon Trey Wright drags Ceyxs body through the pool seemingly into a watery grave while an ensemble of actors create tidal waves PERIOD Ceyxs body returns possessed by a god so his wife can know hes dead and Richter turns his body green making him look like a ghost from an old episode of Scooby Doo. there isnt an intermission in the 80minute performance and its probably for the best PERIOD The lack of a cohesive story line makes it hard to stay immersed PERIOD The actors do the best they can but there really isnt time for them to add to their characters due to the plays design PERIOD There are instances of humor  basically whenever Joe Markesbury is on stage  but the audience is never ready for humor so they forget to laugh or the jokes just arent that funny PERIOD

These old tales are timeless and have survived all these years just on a page so its hard to see a reason for there to even be this muchtalkedabout pool PERIOD One thing the pool does do for the performance is give the audience something to look at when they zone out PERIOD

Metamorphoses is obviously not supposed to be a runofthemill theater experience PERIOD Its an experimental production and like most experimental art once the idea is understood there really isnt a need to see more PERIOD
