A Voice for the Students

By Abbey Frederick 

Herald Staff

Three times every year the Hobart and William Smith Board of Trustees assembles to discuss issues on campus meet with faculty clubs and sports teams and make crucial decisions about the future of the Colleges PERIOD The Board includes alumnae and alumni from the class of  to the class of  and from a wide range of professions PERIOD It also includes two especially important members the Student Trustees one from Hobart and one from William Smith PERIOD Tyler Fuller  and Brianna Moore  serve as intermediaries between the Trustees and the student body aiming to connect the administration with the opinions and interests of HWS students PERIOD

Though the Student Trustees speak on behalf of the student populous many HWS students may not fully understand the role PERIOD Tyler Fuller the Hobart senior Student Trustee asserts that it is important to him that students know he represents them and that the Trustees are eager to understand how HWS students feel PERIOD

Tyler a Biochemistry and Spanish double major is in a unique position to facilitate compromise PERIOD He recognizes that as with the governance of any large institution opinions and goals for the future of the colleges range widely PERIOD Its important to Tyler to cultivate a collaborative attitude PERIOD It isnt always easy to bridge the gap since the opinions of students often arent popular with Board members. he emphasizes that despite these conflicts the attitude is always respectful and discussion is almost always constructive PERIOD The Trustees are usually very receptive because they care about the colleges very much Tyler says adding They have all donated a lot of time talent and treasure to this school. student Trustees are elected during their sophomore year PERIOD They serve as Junior Trustees during their junior year and become voting members as seniors PERIOD As they gain experience with the processes of the Board they also gain more responsibility PERIOD As seniors they run the elections of new Student Trustees and play a large role in the planning of graduation and commencement ceremonies PERIOD

One of their most notable responsibilities in planning commencement is the organization of a vote for the seating arrangement at graduation the senior class votes to decide whether William Smith and Hobart students will sit separately or mixed together PERIOD

This may seem like a simple decision but it is representative of a longterm debate about the coordinate system which exemplifies how challenging it can be to bridge the gap between students and the Board PERIOD The question as to whether the coordinate system should be perpetuated or the Colleges should be combined has been contested for decades PERIOD Tyler says that there are very few coordinate colleges in existence today and the system forces some people to align with a gender dichotomy that doesnt represent them PERIOD

Tyler emphasizes the importance of recognizing the rich history of the Colleges while making efforts to contemporize the coordinate system in order to make it inclusive of all students PERIOD

Trustee members make longterm intuitional decisions regarding issues which are often as complex as that of the coordinate system PERIOD Tyler notes that because the student body itself is often so divided on many issues it can be difficult to speak on behalf of everyone PERIOD We attend student government meetings where many students go to express their frustrations PERIOD We also meet with various clubs throughout the semester to ask them for their feedback and opinions. then Tyler and Brianna compile a report which they hope conveys an accurate picture of the biggest most relevant issues students are talking about PERIOD According to Tyler they try to focus on largescale issues like protests or frustrations expressed by a majority of students though he didnt specify what kinds of frustrations theyve chosen to report in the past PERIOD They present their reports at the triannual Board meetings PERIOD

In the recent past the Student Trustees played a large role in advising the Board on President Vincents transition particularly regarding how students would respond to various events. tyler says this transition has gone very smoothly PERIOD

The student body has been relatively quiet recently he later added PERIOD

At the Board meetings Brianna and Tyler also sit on committees like the Student Affairs committee and the Buildings and Grounds committee PERIOD These committees then reconvene for discussions among the entire Board PERIOD The most recent Trustee Weekend took place Friday February ninth through Sunday the eleventh  PERIOD

The current Junior Trustees are Caitlin Lasher  and Gavin Gross  and the next elections for sophomore Student Trustees will be held Friday March second PERIOD The candidates are Gavin Flood  Joshua Andrews  Grant Emerson  Bartholomew Lahiff  Edens Fleurizard  Tanner Arnold  and Gabriel Pietrorazio  for Hobart Gianna Gonzalez  Amelia McGowan  and Celidad Colon  for William Smith PERIOD Students from all classes can vote and are strongly encouraged to do so PERIOD
