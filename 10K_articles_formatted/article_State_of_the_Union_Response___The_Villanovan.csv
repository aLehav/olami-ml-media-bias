Last week President Joseph Biden gave his second State of the Union Address of his presidency which was full of a few highs as well as significant low points PERIOD

Despite his party outperforming expectations in the midterm election cycle Biden has now lost his unified control of government PERIOD As such the annual speech was an opportunity for him to explain his vision for the next two years to millions of viewers PERIOD Notably however the low moments overshadowed the positive ones PERIOD

The main theme of Bidens speech seemed to be the same one that pushed him over the finish line in  unity PERIOD In reality it is a compelling pitch in a country that has continually grown in political polarization PERIOD This message helped him in  by making swing voters more comfortable with Biden personally than his opponent PERIOD In an attempt to tap into this same energy he frontloaded his speech with both bipartisan rhetoric and achievements PERIOD

He began his speech by congratulating Kevin McCarthy on becoming Speaker of the House saying that he doesnt want to ruin his reputation but looks forward to finding common ground PERIOD He then began to name some pieces of legislation such as touting the effects of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and the PACT Act which grants benefits to veterans who have been exposed to toxic substances during their service PERIOD

These points were very effective as they served to give off a sense of optimism to those who do not follow politics much suggesting that political tension in the country may be on the decline PERIOD

However despite a decent start to the speech where Biden emphasized coming together his call for unity is one that has lost much of its impact due to the actions taken in the first half of his term PERIOD One such area is his COVID19 policies where he has faced criticism from even a few members of his party PERIOD He stated that COVID had shut down our businesses closed our schools and robbed us of so much which was certainly true in  PERIOD

However once Operation Warp Speed produced safe and effective vaccines this was no longer a necessity but was largely rather due to his policies and rhetoric PERIOD His urging to push unnecessary COVID precautions once the vaccines were widely available in the spring of  created fear and even made it seem like the vaccine was not worth taking PERIOD

In addition his attempted vaccine mandate under the auspices of OSHA divided Americans even further as he blamed about a quarter of the country for not being able to go back to normal PERIOD While his mandate for the private sector was struck down by the Supreme Court tens of thousands of Americans lost their jobs due to their choice to not to get the vaccine at a time when many businesses were lifting their vaccine mandates PERIOD

Another area where Biden placed focus was the economy and how he had created  million new jobs PERIOD This claim is questionable as many of those jobs were ones that existed before the pandemic with his policies arguably hindering further growth PERIOD He also barely touched on inflation and how it continues to be a recordhigh rate despite a significant decrease from last year PERIOD

Biden then turned to the border which has been one of the weakest aspects of his administration PERIOD While he claims to endorse securing the border and supporting the members of the border patrol the past two years have seen no meaningful effort to negotiate border policy or even visit the border until very recently PERIOD

Instead the Biden administrations lack of sound border policy has led to many border cities resources to be stretched thin PERIOD Even notable Democrats like Governor Jared Polis of Colorado and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have called on the Biden Administration to develop its border response PERIOD

Lastly the President spoke about China and readiness to retaliate against hostile actions if needed PERIOD These remarks while necessary seemed hollow after waiting nearly a week to shoot down a Chinese spy balloon as it hovered near nuclear sites across the country PERIOD This decision undercut Bidens strength against the Chinese government while President Xi Jinping seems to be becoming more aggressive concerning Taiwan and more generally PERIOD

I would be remiss if I did not mention the moments when actions from members of the GOP sparked audible outrage PERIOD I agree that in an ideal world this would be inappropriate behavior and disrespectful to the President PERIOD

However during President Trumps State of the Union Addresses members of the Democratic Party were seen leaving the speech early and thenSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ripped the presidents speech PERIOD Those moments did not cause nearly as much outrage from mainstream media outlets PERIOD GOP Congress members interruptions at Bidens State of the Union Address did not seem like a big deal in comparison PERIOD

Overall President Biden gave a speech that had some points worthy of praise but many more that should be scrutinized PERIOD Heading into the next few years of divided government it will be interesting to see if Biden adopts the Clintonian third way approach attempting to reconcile the right and the left or whether he doubles down on the agenda of his first two years PERIOD
