Dear Editor

Hey  What happened to the time between Halloween and Thanksgiving  You know the whole month of November  For some reason every where I go all I see is December Christmas decorations presentsetc PERIOD  Did I happen to fall asleep and some how miss November  Seriously when did Christmas decide that December wasnt a big enough month  There is even a radio station that is playing nothing but Christmas music between now and that usurping day. last time I checked most people liked Thanksgiving PERIOD  I wonder what happened to it PERIOD  Maybe its just in hiding or something PERIOD  If you happen to see it or November for that matter make sure you let me know PERIOD  Until then I guess I will revel in PseudoChristmas and get me some PseudoEgg Nog milk by any other name PERIOD
