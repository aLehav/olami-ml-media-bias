Speculation still surrounds last Saturdays car accident involving five Michigan mens basketball players and one recruit PERIOD
Michigan coach Steve Fisher tried to answer some of the questions about the incident in a statement released Wednesday afternoon PERIOD
The Gophers play the Wolverines on Saturday in Ann Arbor Mich PERIOD
The players and the recruit were reportedly returning to campus from a party in Detroit when their automobile went off the road and rolled over PERIOD No one was seriously injured but freshman Robert Traylor broke his arm and is out for the remainder of the season PERIOD
The accident occurred around  a.m. and involved Traylor Louis Bullock Ron Oliver Willie Mitchell and Maurice Taylor PERIOD Mateen Cleaves a recruit from Flint Mich. was also in the car PERIOD
Taylor was driving the car at the time of the crash PERIOD
Players may have violated an NCAA rule by bringing Cleaves to the party PERIOD The rule states recruits may not be taken outside a 30mile radius from campus while they are on an official school visit PERIOD
It appears a violation has happened but we wont do anything until we get the actual mileage  were clocking that right now Craig Keilitz Michigans athletic compliance coordinator said Monday PERIOD
In Wednesdays statement Fisher said his players were aware of the 30mile radius stipulation but they believed they were within the radius when they went to Detroit PERIOD
Its more than  miles said Gophers assistant coach Milt Barnes who is from the Detroit area PERIOD Last I measured it was  miles. fisher said the incident will be reported to the NCAA as if the violation did occur and he will wait for its assessment and judgment PERIOD
If the players did break the rule Cleaves may be ruled ineligible PERIOD
According to police reports alcohol or drugs were not a factor in the accident PERIOD Fisher said the statements of players law enforcement officials and hospital emergency room personnel all show alcohol and drugs were not a factor prior to or during the accident PERIOD
Taylor reportedly fell asleep while driving a  Ford Explorer Limited Edition PERIOD The vehicle is priced at more than  and is reportedly leased by his grandmother Ellen Lloyd PERIOD
On the question of who owns the vehicle driven by Maurice Taylor we must note that as a matter of department policy we annually register vehicles driven by studentathletes Fisher said PERIOD The vehicle driven by Maurice Taylor was reported accordingly. fisher seems to have reprimanded his players for their poor judgment by being out at that hour of the morning but made no mention of possible suspension PERIOD
I have taken actions that will include placing the studentathletes involved on probation and have established significant restrictions that will last at least until the end of the school year Fisher said PERIOD
He did not elaborate on those restrictions PERIOD Except for Traylor the other four Michigan players involved in the incident were expected to play in Thursday nights game at Penn State PERIOD
The Wolverines havent shown any signs of letting down their play despite the loss of Traylor PERIOD They defeated Indiana on Saturday before falling to No PERIOD  Penn State  on Thursday PERIOD
They showed that they arent going to miss Robert Traylor that much Barnes said PERIOD They made the adjustment they had to make and came out and did the job against Indiana PERIOD
Theyve got six or seven high school AllAmericans PERIOD They still have good quality talent on that team. minnesota is riding a fourgame Big Ten winning streak which is the longest in Coach Clem Haskins  seasons PERIOD The Gophers believe they need to win three of their remaining five games to make a strong bid for the NCAA tournament PERIOD
Minnesota hasnt won at Michigan since   the year of its last Big Ten championship  and is coming off a sloppy win against Ohio State on Wednesday night PERIOD
Players believe they need to come out with more emotion if they expect to earn their first victory at Crisler Arena in  years PERIOD
Weve got to win a couple on the road said Gophers freshman Courtney James PERIOD Michigan will be a good chance for us PERIOD One of their best players is out for the season PERIOD So we have to come out play hard and try to get their big men in foul trouble. this story contains information from The Associated Press PERIOD
