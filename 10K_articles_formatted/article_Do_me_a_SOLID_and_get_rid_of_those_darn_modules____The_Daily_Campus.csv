Anyone who runsa club at the University of Connecticut is probably unsurprised that UConn is among the  worst colleges for free speechaccording to the Foundation of Individual Rights in Education PERIOD In relation to clubs their attitude towards first amendment rights is horrendous.Their approach to free associationand allowing meetings on campusis byzantinebloatedand should be abolished.If UConn truly trusts its students to make their own decisions then why does it insist upon making us go through hours of modules of little to no value

The University of Connecticut should radically change its approach to clubs on campus and give students significantly more discretion about running organizations PERIOD AllStudent Organization Leaders Intentional Development SOLIDtrainings should be optionalandmembership requirementsorconstitution submissions should not be grounds for a club to be frozen PERIOD Without significantly curtailing SOLID students willwasteincreasing amounts of time filling out paperworkandUConnwillcontinue to struggle to create leaders PERIOD

After talking toleaders ofother organizations I have grownconvinced the University of Connecticutprefers studentstonot get involved than risk potential liability PERIOD It is an opensecret that the trainings in place are completely useless and everyone including SOLID employees know and joke aboutthe idiocy.Even worseSOLIDsadvice isactivelycounterproductive.My friend from improv told methat SOLIDs approach to harassment is to distract the harasser with aYouTubevideo while one whisks the victim away to asafe location.That advice sounds like it came out of a bad improv skit.If these kernels of wisdom are what one learns at appointments only offered several times a week and often during class times then the systemis afailure PERIOD

Others have approached me to tell me that getting sanctioned on campus is oftentimes not worthwhile.The emcee of improvtold meSpice club is an unsanctioned offthebook club that SOLID never bothered to respond to.Katie president of AI clubtold meMy club just opened a Peoples Bank account instead of dealing with the SABO account because of the red tape.Turning Points presidentstatedthat RSOs prefer to raise their own funds than deal with funding requests because of the frustrating red tape. i find it extremely frustrating that as studentswe are expected to put the effort of a fulltime job into our studiesthenrather than making getting involved easy we are forced into trainings at inconvenient timesgetfrozen for months at a time and are told that we can only fill out forms onlineforpaperworkthattakesweeks to process PERIOD

Furthermore as anRegistered Student Organization RSOleader myself Ive learned firsthandhow bad SOLID is PERIOD My personal disdain of SOLID started when I helped form the Young Americans for Liberty chapter on campus. under the regulations of UConn groups are not allowed to meet in classroomstable hold any events advertise or recruit until they are recognized PERIOD However one needs at least eight students to be involved in order to create the club effectively creating a Catch22 PERIOD Furthermore since SOLID takes weeks to respond to people combines virtual forms and paperwork andmisleadstudents about funding deadlines the system needs to be burnt to the ground PERIOD

While one may be tempted to think that SOLID is only problematic because of an ineffective missive or failed communication they would be wrong PERIOD The truth is that bureaucracy begets bureaucracy and the incentive structure of theheapsof bureaucrats is notthe same asours.Bureaucrats gain power prestige and wealth as they increase their responsibilities and add to their staff so they actively look for ways to make themselves essential by documenting nonsense asking for titles that mean nothingand wasting everyones time PERIOD
