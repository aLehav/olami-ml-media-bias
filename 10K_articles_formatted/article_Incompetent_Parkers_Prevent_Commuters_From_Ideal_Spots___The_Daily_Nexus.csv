I am sure everyone has had this feeling You are driving home late from the library or your girlfriends or boyfriends place PERIOD You are looking to fall comfortably onto your bed and knock out PERIOD Theres just one problem when you get to your home a neverending stockade of cars all around it PERIOD They are on every nook and cranny of every sidewalk PERIOD I dont wonder why so many people are here in this town but why are so many people unable to park

My biggest peeve about parking in I.V PERIOD is those people who park their Jetta in a spot fit for a truck and trailer PERIOD Do they not realize that they can make room for another person to park there These people have no sense of consideration PERIOD Why are those people being selfish when they are prone to the same predicament that all I.V PERIOD residents are in I personally try to use every space efficiently because I want someone to be able to find a spot as easily as I did PERIOD Some people have 6foot gaps between their car and others just for the sake of being safe from hits. add up the big spaces between cars and you would find enough space for another two spots Damn So next time you park your car make sure you leave room for someone else because odds are I left you a spot first
