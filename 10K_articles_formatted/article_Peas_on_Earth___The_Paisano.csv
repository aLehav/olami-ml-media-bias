A Swifties analysis of  Taylors Version

Raised awareness of human contribution to the downfall of our environment has made some individuals ask themselves What can I do to make a change One of the most popular ecofriendly trends has been transitioning to a vegan or vegetarian diet and lifestyle to reduce ones carbon footprint PERIOD

Animal agriculture is one of the top culprits for emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere PERIOD Shown in documentaries such as What the Health Forks over Knives and Cowspiracy the climate conditions have become significantly worse over the years as most people are raised to regularly consume meat and dairy with almost every meal specifically in the United States PERIOD

The mass consumption of meat and dairy products has led to mass production PERIOD As these products have a short shelflife a high level of waste occurs PERIOD Due to a large demand for meat and dairy production companies have little regard for how they treat the animals and therefore little regard for the products they are selling to the consumer PERIOD

The overcrowding in these facilities where the livestock are raised is producing a greater concentrated amount of methane that goes into the atmosphere PERIOD The carbon dioxide emissions produced from the farm machinery are also a large contributors PERIOD

None of this is going to stop climate change but its in line with the truth which is that we need to fundamentally change how our economy works and how we live if we want to avoid climate catastrophe. justice Lovin

According to the Huffington Post and the U.S PERIOD Environmental Protection Agency  percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are produced by agricultural practices PERIOD The reduction of mass production and consumption encouraged by capitalism could lead to a global decrease in food waste and carbon footprints of consumers PERIOD

According to the Huffington Post vegan and vegetarian carbon footprints are half the size of meat eaters PERIOD

The carbon and methane emissions caused by animal agriculture are not the only concerning factor but also the excessive use of water that goes into producing meat and dairy products PERIOD Also according to the Huffington Post it takes  gallons of water to produce one pound of chicken  gallons per pound of pork and  gallons per pound of beef PERIOD As compared to the average amount of water used per pound to produce most fruits and vegetables ranges between  to  gallons per pound PERIOD Of course water is essential to grow or raise any type of food but the growing animal agricultural production levels are wasting our most essential natural resource PERIOD

The vegan or vegetarian lifestyle does not have to be something that takes away from the joys of life but rather add a reassurance that you as an individual are actively participating in making a change PERIOD Justice Lovin senior english major said Going vegan is a great way to lessen your impact on the environment without having to make a really difficult lifestyle change PERIOD Its on the same level as not owning a car and for some its equally impossible but for most if not all can afford to cut out dairy or even just eat meat less regularly. there is a common misconception that vegans and vegetarians are not consuming the proper nutrients the body needs to thrive PERIOD This is untrue as with any diet it is an active choice for what you consume PERIOD There are vegan and vegetarian options for almost every traditional food item which is an opportunity to try new things and possibly substitute some of your favorites for a more ecofriendly alternative PERIOD

There are more options than just following either a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle PERIOD A rising trend is meatless Monday which entails that one does not consume meat products all day PERIOD Once a week simple right These small changes to ones diet can make a much larger impact than assumed PERIOD There is hope for the planet and there is hope for humanity to make more ethical and ecoconscious choices PERIOD
