Each year since  The Office of Disability Services has presented the O.S.A PERIOD Humanitarian Award in honor of the late Fr PERIOD Bill Atkinson the first quadriplegic to be ordained through the Augustinian order PERIOD The award is presented to an individual or organization who exemplifies the spirit of service and the love for community that Fr PERIOD Bill Atkinson embodied during his lifetime PERIOD This year the  Fr PERIOD Bill Atkinson O.S.A PERIOD Humanitarian Award was presented to Eric LeGrand PERIOD

LeGrand is a former defensive tackle for Rutgers University who on Oct PERIOD   suffered a collision that fractured his C3 and C4 vertebras and left him paralyzed from the neck down PERIOD The doctors told his mother Karen LeGrand that her son was given a  percent chance of ever regaining full neurological control PERIOD

Translation According to doctors Eric LeGrand is never supposed to walk again PERIOD These odds are not stopping him PERIOD

In the Villanova Room on Thursday Feb PERIOD  Eric LeGrand told his story to a standing room only crowd that was peppered with bright red Novability Tshirts provided by Villanova Disability Services PERIOD LeGrand was interviewed on stage by Keith Jones Villanova alumnus and nightly host of NBC Philadelphia news at  PERIOD There were several questionanswer components to the interview but regardless of the questions the answers were all very similar PERIOD

With every response LeGrand found a way to work his humor hope and gratitude into the conversation PERIOD LeGrand says that he has nothing to complain about as he speaks of all of the people who have been with him from the start PERIOD He also acknowledges that with his increasing fame LeGrand was featured on the December  cover of Sports Illustrated he has the whole world supporting him as well PERIOD And for that he is grateful PERIOD

The oneword campaign that blew up after LeGrands injury is one that embodies Erics entire journey Believe PERIOD This one word with a twofold meaning the el in the middle of the word conveniently makes up Eric LeGrands initials summarizes LeGrands entire outlook on life both before and after his accident PERIOD LeGrand believes in healing support and perhaps most importantly in hope PERIOD His last words to his mother before entering his first surgery after the injury were prophetic Ill be back. though still in a wheelchair these are words that Eric LeGrand continues to say with confidence PERIOD

In the Villanova Room LeGrand acknowledged his role as spokesperson for those with physical disabilities but he also made it a point to say that his disability is not his defining quality PERIOD In fact despite the initial predictions of the doctors LeGrands physical disability is only a temporary quality PERIOD When asked what remained within him after the injury LeGrand said that everything remained within him PERIOD The accident changed nothing about who LeGrand was and is as a person PERIOD He still enjoys life hanging with friends and family telling jokes and making people smile PERIOD For LeGrand a sense of humor has a healing quality as is evidenced by LeGrands Twitter account in which he has coined the hashtag SpinalCordProblems PERIOD

Though LeGrands attitude is overwhelmingly positive it is also realistic PERIOD Although he has every intention of walking again LeGrand acknowledges that the current state of his body comes with a unique set of responsibilities that he takes very seriously PERIOD LeGrand vocalized several times throughout the evening his belief in the fact that he is part of Gods larger plan PERIOD Part of that plan LeGrand says is being the face of disability. that is at least for the time being PERIOD

When asked what his biggest success in life was LeGrand replied that his biggest success has not happened yet PERIOD LeGrand says that he is still doing big things. leGrand is constantly looking ahead as he holds to the words he told his mother on that first day of surgery Ill be back. whether LeGrand realizes it or not he is already back PERIOD And it is because of this that when LeGrand does finally walk away from his wheelchair the entire world will be cheering from the stands PERIOD
