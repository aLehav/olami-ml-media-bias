Glover said Menas openness and understanding is what makes him the best candidate PERIOD

As a leader Mena fosters an environment in which the individuals on his team are able to showcase their talents in order to get the most accomplished for the whole she said PERIOD I think that sort of sums up his vision for our town PERIOD He has such appreciation and recognition for the people of this area and understands what a rich and diverse talent pool is available for our town to draw from when looking for solutions to problems. the sense of community within Boone is something Mena thinks needs to be recognized PERIOD
