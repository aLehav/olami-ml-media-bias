In an interview with The Daily Irfan reflected on his experience on the Diversity Affairs Committee this past semester and said he looks forward to continuing that work in connecting with student organizations as LSA SG president PERIOD

In the past term I think weve definitely done a better job reaching out to different studentorganizations Irfan said PERIOD But I must continue that effort PERIOD Weve established the liaison positions but I must continue formulating those ties and relationships. irfan also discussed the ways he and Wajahat plan to increase student involvement in LSA SG PERIOD

Many student organizations dont know that they can apply for funding to LSA SG they dont know that LSA SG has committees that are working on sometimes very similar things to CSG but different things as well Irfan said PERIOD I really hope that our external relations committee starts that process of reaching out to different organizations and establishing meetings with them to really gauge their input gauge what they want LSA SG to pursue PERIOD And I think as a result of that we might be able to tap on higher voter turnout as well as more student engagement in government. irfan described the support and camaraderie he felt during the campaign process and while awaiting the results PERIOD

The sense of community I felt throughout this whole process support that I received from so many different communities and organizations on campus  that made me feel like I was a part of a bigger community Irfan said PERIOD

Below are the preliminary results for the  LSA representatives

Irfan and Wajahat agreed that it is important to ensure transparency and efficiency and emphasized the importance of increasing representation in student government PERIOD Wajahat said she hopes to make sure every voice is heard and all students are being represented by LSA SG PERIOD

The one main goal that we have is just bringing in more representation within LSA Student Government Wajahat said PERIOD Making sure that every voice is heard making sure that minority voices are heard especially because were both people of Color  just making the environment a little bit more open and accepting of different experiences and different voices. daily Staff Reporter Samantha Rich can be reached sammrichumich.edu PERIOD

Correction A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Bilal Irfan helped create the LGBTQ liaison position in January PERIOD Irfan was not involved in the creation of this liaison and was instead referring to the goal of connecting with student organizations through liaison positions PERIOD
