We often talk about hot streaks when referencing athletes in professional sports but when it comes to Steven Spielberg in the 1990s to the early 2000s we also have to talk about his streak of excellent films PERIOD



From  until  Spielberg was unrivaled in his art directing high grossing films that continually received acclaim from critics and audiences alike PERIOD This separated Spielberg from his contemporaries as it seemed he just couldnt make a bad movie PERIOD



It all started with the  classic and todays film being discussed Jurassic Park. immediately the film has an energy that lets you know something special is coming PERIOD



And its a special feeling that has hooked me in every time Ive watched the movie since I first saw it with my dinosaur figures in hand so many years ago PERIOD



The characters immediately have an electricity and chemistry that makes watching every scene with the main and supporting cast a delight and the film does an excellent job of normalizing pretty radical science fiction themes PERIOD



Jurassic Park gives the audience a quick rundown of how scientists extracted dinosaur DNA from mosquitos and then proceeded to clone the dinosaurs from the DNA PERIOD



By presenting impossible reallife science in the film in a manner that seems wellreasoned and researched we are able to go along with it and feel like their science is real and believable PERIOD



All of which helps us buy into the spectacle and the main draw  dinosaurs PERIOD



The appearance of dinosaurs and the reactions of the main characters to them is everything and more you can ask for from an adventure film PERIOD



Even now when I watch Jurassic Park after having seen it so many times before it resonates with me PERIOD



The appreciation and reactions of awe to the living dinosaurs and their incredible might contributes to this feeling because it makes it feel like Im there reacting with the main cast of characters when we see the dinosaurs PERIOD



When a triceratops is sick and laying on the ground we the audience and the characters emote the same feeling of sadness and wanting resolution as though it were any ordinary animal we see today PERIOD



Which again lends itself to making the dinosaurs feel more grounded and real thereby endearing the dinosaurs to us and rationalizes and reasoning with the science fiction and outlandish story PERIOD



Its an ability that Steven Spielberg has shown throughout his career as a filmmaker PERIOD



He can take enormous topics and ideas that would seem unfathomably difficult for any audience to watch and be able to relate with and bring them down to a rudimentary level we can all love and appreciate because the perspective of his filming is from that of our own PERIOD



That combination along with the subject matter is what makes Jurassic Park one of my favorite movies to watch PERIOD



Every time I feel like a little kid again sitting down to watch the dinosaurs and feel absolutely enthralled in the direction acting and story from the excellent novelist Michael Crichton PERIOD



Even though the technology used to make the dinosaurs lifelike in the film is nearly  years old it still looks and feels state of the art PERIOD



In my mind it goes without saying that Jurassic Park is far and away the best dinosaur film there ever has been and ever will be PERIOD



And every time I watch Jurassic Park I feel like that little kid again looking up and at the big dinosaurs while I play with my toys PERIOD Its pretty rare to find films that capture your imagination and heart like Jurassic Park does PERIOD
