In a room where every seat was filled attendees at Throwaway Youth Stories of Springfields Homeless Teens were exposed to a previously invisible perspective on homelessness teenagers PERIOD The event held on Friday Sept PERIOD  used music and dramatic readings to highlight the growing population of homeless teenagers in the Springfield area PERIOD

Roseann Bentley Greene County Commissioner gave the opening remarks PERIOD

This is a message that is hard to take but we need to hear Bentley said PERIOD

The event began with performances by students in the MSU Opera Workshop directed by Ann Marie Daehn PERIOD Graduate vocal performance student Sierra Saylor senior vocal performance major Shannon Dey and graduate vocal performance student Michael Payne performed selections from the  opera La Boheme. the opera tells the story of a group of young Parisians who intend to enjoy life even though they live in poverty PERIOD They also suffer from the effects of tuberculosis PERIOD

In addition sophomore musical theatre major Joe Guccione performed Your Eyes from the  musical RENT which was inspired by La Boheme. written by Jonathan Larson RENT tells the story of young artists struggling to survive in New York City during the AIDS crisis PERIOD

Immediately following the musical performances junior acting major and Giving Voice actress Molly Grotha stood up in the middle of the audience PERIOD The actress launched into a story about an abusive stepfather and her mothers sexual abuse PERIOD Gradually she was joined by six other Giving Voice actors who appeared among the audience senior creative writing major Robert Colyer senior acting major Dejuan Boyd senior speech and theatre education major Kendrick Hooks sophomore acting major Mason Kirkland senior acting major Tyler Coleman and sophomore acting major Matt Huebner PERIOD

The actors all read similar narratives of homelessness and neglect appearing to have formed a support group for each other PERIOD All of the pieces were excerpts from Nancy Fairbanks novel Throwaway Youth Stories of Springfields Homeless Teens. the thing about being homeless is you create little homeless families so that youre not completely alone Huebner in character said PERIOD Trying not to be alone is one of the hardest things because if youre trying to do everything completely by yourself its really hard on all of you. the actors fought the stigma that homeless teenagers choose their situations PERIOD

This isnt a choice this is just something that happens Colyer in character said PERIOD

As the actors went back to their seats among the audience they said in unison After all were just children. fairbank an alumna of Central High School in Springfield and a current student at University of Texas at Dallas began this project during her junior year of high school PERIOD She became aware of the issue after learning about Rare Breed a basic assistance center for homeless runaway and atrisk youth PERIOD She said she was impressed with the services that the Rare Breed offers PERIOD

Springfield and the Rare Breed have one of the most comprehensive successful programs of anywhere that Ive seen Fairbank said PERIOD I think that Springfield should be very proud of its community. however Fairbank also said that theres a long way to go. according to Fairbank there are over . million homeless youth every year around the country PERIOD The goal of her book is to spread awareness about this in hopes that more people will go out and help youth in these situations PERIOD

The youth blend in PERIOD Youth homelessness is called The Invisible Problem because its not as visible as adult homelessness Fairbank said PERIOD

Dr PERIOD James Baumlin organizer of the event and distinguished professor of English praised the work that is being done by students to raise awareness of this issue PERIOD

I find myself here with multiple generations in this room and I would invite you all to look around and see the present and future of our community Baumlin said PERIOD We have a good future. your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers",“Throwaway Youth” exposes invisible problem | News | the-standard.org,Missouri State University
