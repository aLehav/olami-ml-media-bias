Eastern administrators held a QA via Facebook Thursday night to explain what the next academic year will look like PERIOD

Provost Jay Gatrell Vice President for Student Affairs Anne Flaherty Executive Director of the Office of Inclusion and Academic Engagement Mona Davenport and Associate Vice President for Enrollment Management Josh Norman took part in the livestream to answer questions for both incoming and current students PERIOD

The four administrators began with answering frequently asked questions and then took questions from viewers PERIOD

The administrators answered one question from the chat before signing off of the livestream



Students will have the option of having a roommate in the residence halls in the Fall  semester but they will also have the ability to have a single room through grants PERIOD

There is not currently an active form on the Eastern website to apply for the grant however Norman said he excepts the form to go live within the next week PERIOD

Doubles rooms have been standard for students at Eastern for several years but over the last academic year roommates became less common due to COVID19 restrictions PERIOD

While we think double room occupancy is a really great choice for our incoming students because it brings an opportunity to have a builtin roommate and friend we know that some students may be interested in having a single option and because of the availability of our high education emergency relief funds students who would feel more comfortable having a single room can apply for a grant for a single but again we are preparing for the semester with all options Flaherty said PERIOD

Flaherty expressed that dining options will be open for students as well PERIOD



Students are expected to be able to know for certain what mode their courses will be offered in by the time they register PERIOD

Gatrell emphasized that the university cannot be sure that delivery modes will stay the same as the pandemic continues due to the uncertainty of it PERIOD

More facetoface courses are expected to be available as restrictions are lifted PERIOD

We are committed to having a facetoface experience with  to  percent of our courses having a facetoface element or component traditional facetoface lectures laboratories studios they really are what were looking forward to in Fall  Gatrell said PERIOD Fall  is going to look a lot different than the current academic year and I think thats a positive but we are going to make sure we follow all of the guidelines. davenport and Flaherty shared opportunities available to students beyond the classroom including tutoring and student organizations and encouraged students to get involved PERIOD

They shared the benefits of the new program Freshman Connection that connects freshmen with upperclassmen for mentoring PERIOD

According to the Freshman Connection website students receive valuable support from other students that span all aspects of life on campus PERIOD Theyll get firsthand knowledge about how to manage classes and studying making friends and joining groups and managing finances while in college. a video of the QA session will be available on Easterns Facebook page PERIOD
