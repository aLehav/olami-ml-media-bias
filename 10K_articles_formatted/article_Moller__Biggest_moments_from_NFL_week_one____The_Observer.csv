Nate Moller  Wednesday September  

There were plenty of surprises and statement wins made in the first week of the NFL season PERIOD Although there is still a lot of football left to play lets take a look at some of the most notable happenings from the opening weekend of the NFL PERIOD

The last two seasons have been full of disappointment for the Vikings especially considering they have plenty of talent on its roster with Justin Jefferson Dalvin Cook Kirk Cousins and Adam Thielen PERIOD After firing their head coach and general manager the Vikings looked like a completely different team in the start of the Kevin OConnell era PERIOD The Vikings offense was fueled by Jefferson who put up  yards and caught two touchdowns PERIOD Aside from Jefferson Cousins did a fantastic job of remaining poised in the pocket PERIOD Running backs Dalvin Cook and Alexander Mattison proved to be a deadly  punch in the backfield with both backs averaging . yards per carry PERIOD

The best news of the day though came on the defensive side of the football which was the Vikings demise last season PERIOD The Vikings front seven proved to be the difference with Danielle Hunter and ZaDarius Smith getting constant pressure on Aaron Rodgers PERIOD If the defense can continue to play well the Vikings should have a chance to push for a division title and playoff spot PERIOD

The Bengals did just about everything wrong on Sunday as Joe Burrow threw a stunning four interceptions in a  loss to the Steelers PERIOD Despite the interceptions the Bengals were set up to lose the game on the leg of kicker Evan McPherson two times PERIOD After missing a PAT to secure the win McPherson missed his second chance to win the game as well shanking a  yard field goal in overtime PERIOD The fact that the Bengals were still in this game despite the turnovers is encouraging but the lack of execution by the reigning AFC champs is concerning to say the least PERIOD

I dont think anyone gave the Bears much of a chance against the 49ers on Sunday but the Bears made a statement scoring  straight points to win  PERIOD Justin Fields looked much improved for the Bears and despite the rainy conditions he threw for  yards and two touchdowns and ran for  yards PERIOD Its hard to fathom the Bears finding much offensive success this season with the talent they have at receiver but the Bears defense showed up on Sunday PERIOD They might have to win a lot of close lowscoring games over the rest of the season if they want to make the playoffs PERIOD

One of the most stunning score lines came from Nashville on Sunday with the Titans losing to the Giants  PERIOD Ryan Tannehill was definitely missing A.J PERIOD Brown as he struggled to get into a rhythm with his receiving corps PERIOD Derrick Henry finished the game with  yards averaging just . yards per carry and PERIOD just last season he failed to change the game PERIOD In fact Henrys longest run on the day was just  yards PERIOD Like the Bengals the Titans failed to execute late as well giving up a Giants touchdown and twopoint conversion with just over a minute remaining as well as missing a game winning 47yard field goal PERIOD

Many expected the Colts to have a really good team this year with Matt Ryan under center PERIOD Ryan was anything but perfect for the Colts on Sunday though as he finished  out of  for  yards with one touchdown and one interception PERIOD The good news for the Colts is that Jonathan Taylor looked fantastic rushing for  yards and a touchdown PERIOD Michael Pittman Jr. who finished with  receiving yards and a touchdown also looks primed for a breakout season PERIOD Despite these breakout performances the Colts failed to make a field goal in overtime and they tied with a much less talented Texans team PERIOD The talent is there for the Colts but a seasonopening tie against the Texans is not ideal PERIOD

The Bucs beat the Cowboys by  but it could have easily been by  PERIOD The Cowboys struggled mightily to move the ball with any authority throughout the game PERIOD To make matters worse for Dallas Dak Prescott is now expected to miss six to eight weeks to receive surgery on his thumb PERIOD The Cowboys will likely need to trade for a quarterback if they are going to save their season as they have an important stretch of games against the Bengals Giants Commanders Rams and Eagles in the next five weeks PERIOD

The Bucs on the other hand looked like a Super Bowl contender on Sunday night PERIOD Despite settling for four field goals they managed to move the ball all night and the defense looked fantastic PERIOD Tom Brady still looked like Tom Brady and Julio Jones looks like a great offseason addition so far PERIOD After week one the Bucs appear to be the favorite to win the NFC PERIOD

The Bills dominated the Rams handily on Thursday night winning by a score of  PERIOD Josh Allen looked sensational with  yards passing  yards on the ground and four total touchdowns PERIOD Allen looks to have a lethal  punch in receivers Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis and this looks like a team that can finally win a Super Bowl PERIOD The defending champion Rams will look to shake off a disappointing week one loss against the Falcons in week two PERIOD

The stunning departure of Tyreek Hill this offseason raised some questions about how the Chiefs offense would perform PERIOD And they didnt miss a beat on Sunday putting up  points against the Cardinals for an easy victory PERIOD Patrick Mahomes was sensational completing  out of  passes for  yards and five touchdowns PERIOD Even without Hill Mahomes still has plenty of options to throw to PERIOD Travis Kelce is of course Mahomes top choice but Juju SmithSchuster and Marquez ValdesScantling should prove to be great options for Mahomes as well PERIOD After week one it looks like the Chiefs and Bills might be set for a showdown in the AFC Championship PERIOD

The Broncos had a fourth down and five from the Seahawks 46yard line and rather than putting the ball in Russell Wilsons hands they opted to kick a 64yard field goal PERIOD Brandon McManus sent the field goal wide left and the Seahawks held on to win PERIOD Considering Russell Wilsons pedigree its an interesting play call to say the least and there will be plenty of questions raised among the Broncos coaching staff going forward PERIOD Nevertheless its a great win for the Geno Smithled Seahawks who will look to prove the doubters wrong PERIOD
