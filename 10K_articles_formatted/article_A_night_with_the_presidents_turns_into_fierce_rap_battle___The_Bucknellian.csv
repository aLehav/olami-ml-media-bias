A Night with the Presidents featuring University President and President of Bucknell Student Government BSG took an unexpected turn on Nov PERIOD  in the Weis Center for the Performing Arts PERIOD The discussion started smoothly with wellwritten introductions from both presidents but soon descended into chaos when the lights dimmed and a DJ who had been hiding in the corner of the Weis Center started playing hardcore rap beats PERIOD

I thought it was a joke Emma Nem  said PERIOD But then the strobe lights came out and they started rapping about the positive changes BSG had enacted PERIOD It was honestly terrifying. according to wellplaced sources within the administration both presidents thought it best to start a dialogue through an Epic Rap Battlethus appealing to youth culture and making their message all the more powerful PERIOD

Tonights not a lecture its a conversation the BSG president rapped PERIOD No more worries bout communication. the raps covered a variety of topics includingthe establishment ofan emergency training program for the facultythe formulation ofa response to the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA policy and the completion of the WE DO fundraising campaign PERIOD However no one could hear the discussion after a particularly aggressive bass drop PERIOD

If I had to describe the music I would say it was a mix of Kendrick Eminem and the Little Einsteins all rolled up into one really uncomfortable package John Elton  said PERIOD I appreciated the transparency and all but I think I have tinnitus now. the lyrics turned controversial once the University president began addressing elements of the semester that have received criticism from the student body including the rising costs of private education and claims of increasingly stringent regulations against Greek life on campus PERIOD However the audience seemed to approve of his soulful inflections when it was his turn to take the spotlight PERIOD

Were concerned with burnin bank accountsbut the learnin burden is our mission the University President rapped with fiery dulcet tones PERIOD Were educationally efficaciousbut its an expensive proposition. the University President went on to defend his beliefs regarding Greek life and his disappointment with its unique association with the University social scene PERIOD

Frats have been ruining themselvessince  weve kicked off only two the University President rapped PERIOD Plus we drowned the swim teams emailsand the Bison Chips are through. on the whole student feedback to the event has been positive PERIOD While the lyrics and general tone of the rap battle were criticized by students most could not deny the sincerity of their verses PERIOD

They asked us all who won and whos next once it was all over Elton said PERIOD Personally I think the school won tonight. the presidents first album To Pimp a Bison will be distributed in the ELC next week along with a complimentary scoop of We Dough icecream provided by Ben  Jerrys PERIOD
