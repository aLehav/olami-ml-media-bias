The Utes are opening up Pac12 play Friday night against the USC Trojans at home and theyre looking to get their fourth win of the season PERIOD

Utah went  during its nonconference schedule with wins against SUU BYU and San Jose State PERIOD USC on the other hand is  and it opened up conference play last weekend with a loss against Stanford PERIOD

Troy Williams feels like the three opponents leading up to this Pac12 game did a good enough job of preparing them but he is working to clean up his game because of the caliber of players USCs defense will present PERIOD

In Utahs past two games Williams has thrown an interception in the endzone PERIOD But for the most part head coach Kyle Whittingham thinks this years starting quarterbacks passing game is better than what they have received in recent years  Williams has thrown for an average of  yards per game PERIOD However the success of the passing game is not all due to Williams play PERIOD

Wide receiver Tim Patrick has been a main focal point of this years offense and he has been on the receiving end of  passes for a total of  yards PERIOD

Hes got the whole package Whittingham said PERIOD Hes got size PERIOD Patrick is a good route runner PERIOD He works really hard in practice and its no surprise to us that hes performing the way he is PERIOD Hes definitely our gotoguy at this point in the season. williams who grew up in Southern California knows about  of the guys on the USC team so he will be facing a few familiar faces the he lined up against in high school PERIOD And Williams knows that the Trojans record is not an accurate representation of what that team is capable of PERIOD

I dont pay attention to their record at all Williams said PERIOD They have a lot of talent over there both sides of the ball PERIOD They have played two great teams so we have to be conscious of the type of caliber of team they are and respect it. when the Utes travelled to Los Angeles in  they had a  record but the Trojans were quick to halt any momentum the Utes had going for them and the Trojans came out on top with a  win PERIOD Whether or not this had an impact on the rest of the season for the Utes they are not considering Friday nights matchup a revenge game PERIOD

Both Williams and Whittingham have their eyes set on something bigger and thats winning the Pac12 South this season and outright too PERIOD

We want to try and challenge for that Pac12 South title and this is the first step in that regard Whittingham said PERIOD Nonconference games dont have any bearing on that so this is step one and a challenge for our team to try and chase that championship. fridays game is a blackout and kickoff is set for  p.m PERIOD
