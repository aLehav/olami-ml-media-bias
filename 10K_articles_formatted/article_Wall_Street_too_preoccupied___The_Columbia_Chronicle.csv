The Occupy Wall Street protests organized in most major cities across the country are noble on the surface advocating for economic fairness PERIOD In the process though multiple other groups latched onto the initial movements popularity using it to further their own causes PERIOD

Call it creative marketing if nothing else PERIOD

But the protests themselves are misguided unorganized and at this point immensely ineffective unless you consider mass arrests on a New York bridge a victory PERIOD The most good to come from the protests was an unexpected miniconcert by Jeff Mangum the brilliant frontman of Neutral Milk Hotel PERIOD

The aforementioned groups that have been leeching off the originals recognition are convoluting the point PERIOD When Occupy Wall Street was in its infancy its mission was concise and clear The present economic conditions have ushered in a quality of life not befitting twenty-first century America PERIOD

That alone is true and can be blamed for several of the other pressing issues facing the United States today PERIOD

Since then issues such as rising college tuition costs and a pisspoor job market have been thrown in the fray PERIOD Now those are just and righteous causes that most sane people can support or at least understand PERIOD Unfortunately for the protesters and organizers their audience isnt always sane righteous or just PERIOD As more and more causes get included the more and more diluted the protests become PERIOD

One question that very few have raised revolves around timing PERIOD Why did the organizers wait until now to do this Why not sooner Was this done to align with election season

Protesters whove been interviewed by the media talk of being unemployed for two to three years and theyre just now taking action PERIOD The action theyre taking is correct too PERIOD I find myself wholeheartedly agreeing with most if not all of Occupy Wall Streets causes PERIOD But the question still remains What took them so long

The protestersthe havenots and their audienceWall Street executives the havesare of completely different mindsets PERIOD

A member of the Occupy Chicago portion of the movement posted a photo on the groups Facebook page last week that showed the true colors of the people whom the group wants to reach PERIOD Since the movement took shape their unofficial slogan is I am the  percent. but the haves countered that in Chicago with their own smarmy entitled and derogatory sign in an office building window that read We are the  percent. as overdue and justified as the Occupy Wall Street organizers and protesters maybe their message of equality seems to be falling on deaf ears PERIOD
