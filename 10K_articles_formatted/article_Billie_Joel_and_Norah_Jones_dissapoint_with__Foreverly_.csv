Billie Joe Armstrong and Norah Jones team up in what is the most unlikely duo album of the year PERIOD

Foreverly is a reinterpretation of the Everly Brothers album Songs Our Daddy Taught Us. while it is evident that there was some excitement from Armstrong and Jones in making this album it still comes across as boring and uninspired PERIOD

The main complaint against the album is the way that the voices are mixed PERIOD Armstrongs voice tends to overshadow Jones PERIOD While his voice is great for Green Days punk material it seems a little off in Americana songs PERIOD

Jones has better technique and sound overall and it would be interesting to hear how the songs sound with her voice at the forefront PERIOD There are no original songs on this album and for the most part theyre relatively straightforward arrangements PERIOD

Theres nothing that stands out with any particular track and the songs tend to blend in together PERIOD That being said the sounds are incredibly soothing and could make for some nice relaxing background music PERIOD

But its not something that one would just sit and listen to directly PERIOD

Its nice to see these two artists branching into unfamiliar territory especially Armstrong PERIOD Hes more talented than most people give him credit for hes usually stuck in the confines of the pop punk genre PERIOD Although it is nice to see him branch out its just not the right direction for him PERIOD Foreverly isnt a bad album but its also not good PERIOD Its average PERIOD In fact it may be the most average album of the year PERIOD
