Renowned author J.K PERIOD Rowling recently published her new bookThe Ink Black Heart which features characters and plotlines many have pointed out as being disturbingly similar to Rowlings own experiences being canceled on the internet over the past few years PERIOD

Whether you read the books as a young child saw the movies in theaters or got annoyed at people on the playground shouting gibberish at one another everyone and their mother has heard of Harry Potter in some way shape or form PERIOD One of the highest grossing media franchises in the world the Wizarding World and its creator J PERIOD K PERIOD Rowling have impacted the lives of millions of people across the globe PERIOD However more people today tend to know Rowling for a different reason that being her increasingly controversial opinions over the past few years PERIOD Discussion of Rowlings problematic viewpoints has been rampant ever since early  but lately they have resurged quite a bit in the wake of her newest book release The Ink Black Heart. released Aug PERIOD  The Ink Black Heart is the sixth book in Rowlings Cormoran Strike series of crime fiction novels published under the pen name Robert Galbraith. the series revolves around detective Cormoran Strike and his partner Robin Ellacott as they work together solving various crimerelated mysteries PERIOD In this newest story Strike and Ellacott find themselves tasked with investigating the murder of Edie Ledwell creator of a popular YouTube cartoon called The Ink Black Heart PERIOD In one of the opening chapters Ledwell bursts into the detective agency asking Ellacott to track down the identity of a problematic fan who has turned the fanbase of The Ink Black Heart against her and has harassed her online via inciting the hatred of internet social justice warriors against her for alleged racist ableist and transphobic remarks and ideas present in and around the YouTube cartoon PERIOD Soon after leaving the detective agency an unknown assailant stabs Ledwell to death in a nearby cemetery seemingly as a result of internet trolls and social justice warriors targeting her for her problematic viewpoints PERIOD Sound familiar It should PERIOD

On June   Rowling published a series of tweets containing several transphobic viewpoints which along with a lengthy forum post from Rowling herself attempting to defend her stance on the transgender community began digging a hole the author would be unable to climb out of PERIOD Soon after these tweets Harry Potter series actors David Radcliffe Emma Watson and Rupert Grint all released statements condemning Rowlings remarks about the transgender community PERIOD Since then Rowlings reputation has been completely upended going from someone who once lit up the worlds of children to someone who has spread viewpoints that have harmed the lives of many of those same children who grew up with her stories PERIOD

From just that small summary of both scenarios it is clear there are several similarities between J.K PERIOD Rowling and Edie Ledwell PERIOD First both are creators of a hugely popular series and second both have been turned against by their respective fanbases after making insensitive comments regarding certain minority groups PERIOD But anyone could see the similarities between the two just by reading a summary of The Ink Black Heart. after reading over  pages of the novel the similarities between Ledwell and Rowling become even more evident as the story progresses PERIOD Yet whats even more troubling is the content of the novel itself seems to paint Ledwell  who for all intents and purposes may as well be a Rowling selfinsert character  as a tragic figure with people on the internet defending social justice and holding her accountable painted as unethical haters trying to orchestrate an unfounded hate campaign against her PERIOD

For one there are multiple instances in the novel where characters acknowledge the problematic elements present in Ledwells cartoon yet they also assert the idea that she shouldnt be blamed for it PERIOD On page  when describing a part of the cartoon that involves a worm that is specifically described using the term hermaphrodite the character Tim Ashcroft says Edie had had a difficult childhood PERIOD You couldnt blame her for being  not ignorant but  seemingly using her difficult childhood as an excuse for the problematic aspects of the work she created PERIOD At another point in the novel around page  the character Zoe Haigh says  people were orrible to er online  I never thought there were nuthin wrong with it  I read what people were sayin  I wish I adnt who from the perspective of Rowling as a writer could be meant to endear the reader to both Haigh and Ledwell aka Rowlings surrogate character PERIOD

Haigh as a character is also interesting as she seems to almost be a Ledwell apologist PERIOD She still chooses to support the cartoon and indirectly Ledwell herself despite her death despite the many problematic elements PERIOD While characters like Haigh who stick by Ledwell are portrayed in a more positive and sympathetic light those who stand against her and stick up for social justice are given the exact opposite treatment PERIOD

On the opposite end of the spectrum from characters like Haigh one of the more prominent elements present in the novel is a blog titled The Pen of Justice which focuses on problematic aspects of media and calls them out for the world to see PERIOD About a quarter of the way through the novel Rowling showcases a section from one of the posts on The Pen of Justice blog titled Why The Ink Black Heart Is Seriously Ableist and Why That Should Trouble You. some of the points made in the post are very telling of the kind of YouTube show The Ink Black Heart is saying From Hartys regular palpitations to bones dropping randomly off the WyrdyGrobs skeletons were invited to laugh at the strangeness of imperfect bodies PERIOD Sick minds fare no better Paperwhites depression and anorexia and Dreks arguably manicdepressive episodes are likewise mocked. the Pen of Justices points about the cartoons problematic elements are specific and scathing and from the perspective of a creator these points should be extremely important to the creators of a show like this especially when the primary audience of the show is people who have physical or mental disabilities and struggles PERIOD

While in a vacuum this article from The Pen of Justice makes a lot of good points the way the rest of the story treats it removes any and all credibility it could have PERIOD In particular the writer of The Pen of Justice is one of the primary suspects for Ledwells murder throughout most of the novels length and though they are eventually proven innocent on the charge of murder they are also shown to be a digital pedophile removing any shred of credibility they could have had PERIOD With Rowling clearly portraying fans in a positive light and critics in a negative one it is clear that to a certain extent Rowling has learned nothing from her experiences on the internet over the past few years PERIOD

But how does Rowling herself feel about the parallels that have been drawn between her and her newest novel In an interview with Graham Norton Rowling claimed that I should make it really clear after some of the things that have happened the last year that this is not depicting  the first draft of the book was finished at the point where certain things happened essentially claiming any and all similarities between the scenario of the novel and her own life are completely coincidental PERIOD Its funny that she attributes these similarities to coincidence as that seems to be a fallback that Rowling uses frequently as she did when confronted with the history of her pen name Robert Galbraith. many have pointed out that the pen name bears a striking resemblance to the name Robert Galbraith Heath who was a twentieth century psychiatrist who among other things created the abhorrent process we now know as gay conversion therapy PERIOD

Given Rowlings previous controversies with the LGBTQ community it is definitely suspicious her pen name has such an onthenose resemblance to someone with similar viewpoints which is why it is odd that Rowling once again defaulted to the coincidence defense again with her spokesperson saying in an interview with Newsweek that J.K PERIOD Rowling wasnt aware of Robert Galbraith Heath when choosing the pseudonym for her crime novels once again citing the similarity as a coincidence PERIOD Rowling is no stranger to problematic elements in her work as is clear with characters like Cho Chang and the depiction of the goblins in Harry Potter which Rowling has been conveniently silent about over the years despite being called out on it numerous times PERIOD

Even putting aside the many problematic aspects of The Ink Black Heart the story itself just isnt that good PERIOD The main characters are extremely unlikable the portrayal of internet discourse is laughably onenote and the resolution to the murder mystery is quite frankly one of the worst endings Ive ever seen in any piece of media PERIOD Needless to say dont waste your time or money on The Ink Black Heart. the bottom line is J.K PERIOD Rowling needs to stop relying on coincidences and ignorance in order to make a quick cash grab start acknowledging the reality of her own situation and the world around her and realize that not everything is as black and white as The Ink Black Heart would lead one to believe PERIOD

This is a very biased article PERIOD While i do agree with some aspects of critique PERIOD The fact that the book is not good is simply wrong PERIOD If you are doing a book review please stick to the book and focus on the originality of the storyline no matter where it is inspired from or how true it is PERIOD If you read the book in vaccum PERIOD it is brilliant and probably her best work since HP

This article is quite unfair PERIOD Rowlings characters are usually a combination of traits some traits are sympathetic some decidedly are not PERIOD In the case of the Ink Black Heart cartoon we dont ever get to see the cartoon within the larger story in order to have much of an idea what the content was like PERIOD What we do know is that members of the fandom were investigated specifically because their online presence was critical of the author PERIOD We can also infer that the criticisms they made were irrational and chosen not because they were valid but to manipulate others in the fictional fandom mostly comprised of young impressionable and often imbalanced  people to achieve a self serving agenda PERIOD The people being investigated in the story are all internet trolls and one of them is a murderer PERIOD A reasonable person could easily infer from the novel that the content of The Ink Black Heart had nothing to do with trans issues ableism or any of the other numerous criticisms made up by the trolls but was just as were told  a dark stoner fantasy beautifully illustrated about a graveyard in which a disembodied black heart tries to become better than his body was in life and find love after death PERIOD The premise of the cartoon is darkly funny and from it a reasonable person can infer as Ive said that the trolls in the novel are making up motivations that dont exist PERIOD The irony is that the same thing keeps happening in opinion pieces about the novel itself PERIOD Its kind of surreal PERIOD

I couldnt disagree more PERIOD I thought the book was fantastic and Ive been an avid fan of the series since the first book came out PERIOD There is a lot to unpack in this article but I think it important to remember that we often see what we want to see in any piece of artwritingmedia PERIOD Many of the issues posited in the book are not given clear resolutions or answers  Rowling leaves a lot of gray area and doesnt tell readers how to explicitly feel PERIOD Regardless as a piece of crime thriller literature I found The Ink Black Heart hugely entertaining and I would have been happy had it been even longer",OPINION: J.K. Rowling’s newest book is anything but magical – The Appalachian,Appalachian State University
