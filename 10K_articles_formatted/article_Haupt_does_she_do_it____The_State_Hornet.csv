Senior middle hitter Lindsay Haupt always dreamt of playing collegiate volleyball but not for a team as distinguished as Sacramento State PERIOD

When I was in sixth grade I decided I wanted to play college volleyball PERIOD It was kind of a dream ever since I was a little kid Haupt said PERIOD

Although her volleyball career sprouted from a small Division V high school Haupt proved she had the determination to become an allstar athlete PERIOD

I was kind of a raw player when I first came here yet I was really athletic and I had a great attitude  but that was it she said PERIOD

Haupt started her career as a Hornet lacking the mental part of the game PERIOD

I didnt know how to play volleyball really you know at least mentally PERIOD I hadnt been coached in that area before she said PERIOD

Through the teaching of coach Debby Colberg Haupt was shaped into the player she is today PERIOD Colberg told Haupt as a freshman to just listen and soak up as much information as possible PERIOD

When I came in as a freshman my mentality was just to take everything in as much as possible and when Debby talked to me she said she just wanted me to be a sponge and soak everything in and thats exactly what I did Haupt said PERIOD I credit that ability back to a few players Natalie Melcher and Stephanie Gamst who were seniors at the time but took me under their wing and helped me push forward. colberg maintains it was the positive attitude that Haupt possesses that allowed her to quickly develop new skills and become a more wellrounded player PERIOD

Her attitude has always been the same and I think she soaks up all the coaching we can give her Colberg said PERIOD I think she has always come in with her work ethic and her energy even to practices and its probably one of the best Ive ever had out of a player. colberg considers Haupts positive attitude a foundation for her leadership both on and off the court PERIOD

I think that kind of attitude rubs off on her teammates particularly the younger players and it helps tremendously PERIOD That is what we really call leadership PERIOD She is a great role model for everybody Colberg said PERIOD

Haupts teammates also believe it is her good spirit and dedication to the team that allows her to be a positive role model for everyone else PERIOD

Freshman libero Chelsea Goodsell said she wasnt intimidated by any of the seniors PERIOD Haupt made Goodsell feel welcomed PERIOD

As a senior she kind of just made sure that we felt accepted and she wanted us to adjust to college life Goodsell said PERIOD

Goodsell also said Haupt is spending her time teaching younger players and giving them pointers especially in the middle hitter position PERIOD

Especially with Maddison Thivierge like in practices Lindsay would tell her what to do and she also takes all four of us freshmen under her wing PERIOD She really does a good job with that Goodsell said PERIOD

All of Haupts hard work and willingness to learn paid off in a big way PERIOD In  during her freshman year she was named Big Sky Outstanding Freshman PERIOD A year later she was named Big Sky Conference MVP PERIOD

Although the award is based on her individual stats and game performance Haupt credits every award shes won back to her teammates PERIOD

There is no way that any of us could ever get any of these individual awards without a great team PERIOD Volleyball requires so much talk and teamwork that you have to play together to be good as an individual Haupt said PERIOD

Over the next two years Haupt continued to be a dominating force for the Hornets PERIOD In the  season she was named Big Sky Player of the Week twice and so far this season she has already been honored three times PERIOD

Haupt has played in all  games this season and is second in kills with  thus far with a . hitting percentage PERIOD

With the big numbers Haupt has posted there is no question as to why the Hornets are currently  overall and  in the Big Sky Conference PERIOD

The current Hornet squad has the makings of being one of the best teams Colberg has coached PERIOD

Haupt believes it is the hard work and perfection Colberg demands from the girls both in practice and in matches that puts the team at the level its playing at PERIOD

Debby has always pushed us to be the team that we are this year and she has been teaching us especially us seniors the mentality that she wants out on the court the type of play that she wants us to play with and the type of skill that she wants to see out on the court she said PERIOD

One of Haupts favorite parts of volleyball is the bond the team has with each other and the girls ability to come together and play as a team PERIOD

This team this year gets along better than any team I have ever been on PERIOD Our attitudes and how we treat each other really transfers onto the court she said PERIOD It is definitely our good attitudes and our mentality that makes this team my favorite team ever. alicia de la Garza can be reached at emailprotected
