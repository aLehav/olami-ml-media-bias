7654,1970-01-01,"there was a time when things werent so clear for Magdalena Sandoval PERIOD

As a senior out of Los Alamos high school in Los Alamos N.M. the talented cross country runner wasnt planning on attending Oregon PERIOD In fact Sandoval wasnt even going to be near the West Coast PERIOD

She chose Rice University a small private school in Houston Texas PERIOD

I discovered it was the wrong place for me Sandoval said PERIOD I really have no regrets about attending Rice PERIOD It helped me find what was important to me PERIOD I chalk it up to experience. sandoval was recruited out of high school by former crosscountry coach Tom Heinonen and shortly after discovering she didnt prefer Rice anymore Sandoval made the call to Eugene PERIOD

Im absolutely  percent sure Oregon is the right place for me Sandoval said PERIOD I love it here I really do love it. it seems the toughest adjustment for Sandoval has been the weather PERIOD

Im leery of the rain but Im able to handle it she said PERIOD

There doesnt seem to be much the senior cant handle PERIOD After all Sandoval has led Oregon in its past two races PERIOD Sandoval finished second at the Sundodger Invitational and the Willamette Invitational PERIOD

Her passions reach much farther than running PERIOD The oldest of six children the senior loves to cook and has a strong interest in photography PERIOD A double major in geology and photography she finds time to make pumpkin cheesecake pizza dough vegetable pizzas with my own pizza sauce and veggies three inches thick. sandoval hasnt had much success in other sports though PERIOD

I dont have any handeye coordination Sandoval said PERIOD So soccer and basketball were out. that left swimming and cross country but it didnt start out that way PERIOD

In seventh grade I moved from discus and high jump to the mile in track Sandoval said PERIOD From there I went to cross country. it turned out to be the right move PERIOD

I knew I wanted to run in college Sandoval said PERIOD I like to compete. it was geology that kept Sandoval away from her teammates and new coach Marnie Mason during the recent summer months PERIOD

I interned at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Sandoval said PERIOD I did geological mapping with a trio of scientists PERIOD

We mapped the Valles Cardera a national preserve recently acquired by the government PERIOD We created a official new geographical area which was last mapped in the 60s PERIOD We mapped Rhyolitic Domes PERIOD It was my ideal job it applied to my major it was fascinating and it was an incredible learning experience. it now seems as though Sandoval has her life mapped out PERIOD

Although Sandoval was away from her team she had many early mornings to herself to train for the season while her teammates were in Eugene for part or all of the summer PERIOD

I was getting up early before the sun and going out for a run through the woods and forest Sandoval said PERIOD It was cool and quiet PERIOD I got to watch the sky lighten up it was a time to think when all my senses are enhanced PERIOD Then I would come back from the run ready to fuel the day. as with any sport certain days are more fun than others PERIOD It isnt uncommon for a oncerecreational activity in high school to feel like a job for many involved in collegiate competition but not for Sandoval PERIOD

Its a huge honor to run Division I Sandoval said PERIOD Its a testimony to talent work and attitude toward performing PERIOD The fun part is competing and pushing yourself to absolute limits PERIOD Its different than running recreationally than with a goal in mind PERIOD

Teammate and close friend Laura Harmon gets to see three sides of Sandoval The teammate the student and the friend PERIOD

She is so funny and very intelligent Harmon said PERIOD She knows when to be serious and when to have fun PERIOD Because of that she is running really well PERIOD A lot of people take life outside of running too seriously PERIOD She is always laughing PERIOD

She doesnt care what anyone thinks she does what seems fun PERIOD Everyone loves her. and sure enough she loves Oregon PERIOD
