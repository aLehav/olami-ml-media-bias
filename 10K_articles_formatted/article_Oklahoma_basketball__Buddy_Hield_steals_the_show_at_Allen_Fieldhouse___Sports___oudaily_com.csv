LAWRENCE Kansas  Monday nights threeover time contest between No PERIOD  Kansas and No PERIOD  Oklahoma belonged to Buddy Hield PERIOD Until it didnt PERIOD

Oklahoma fell  in triple over time at Allen Fieldhouse Hields offbalance three pointer at the buzzer confirming the loss PERIOD Hield didnt have any more left to give PERIOD

I wish I had one more three left an exhausted Hield said after the defeat PERIOD We had enough chances to win the game PERIOD We just fell short. it was Hields  points that paced the OU effort PERIOD But it did more than that PERIOD It mesmerized a Kansas crowd that has seen more than its fair share of notable performances PERIOD

Kansas coach Bill Self said it was as good as any performance hes seen by an opposing player PERIOD

Buddy made hard shots We actually defended him pretty well in the second half Self said PERIOD He made some ridiculously tough shots which are bad shots for anybody else but good shots for him. the Kansas faithful noticed too PERIOD The crowd stuck around as Buddy Hield gave an oncourt interview PERIOD As he was walking away what was left of the soldout crowd at The Phog gave Hield an ovation PERIOD

He deserved it Kansas guard Perry Ellis said PERIOD Those fans know when they see great players. hields  points match an alltime high by an opposing player in Lawrence tying a mark set by Kansas State player Mike Wroblewski in  PERIOD

Self was able to recall just one other player who received a standing ovation on Kansas home court Kevin Durant PERIOD

We held Durant to  in the first half and then he sprained his ankle and he came back in and they gave him an ovation while the game was still going on Self said PERIOD They knew they were witnessing something special PERIOD

That was a special performance by Buddy tonight PERIOD He got  points on  shots PERIOD Its not like he did it on  shots PERIOD That was pretty special. kansas guard Frank Mason shadowed Hield for most of the night making it as difficult as possible for the reigning Big  Player of the Year to score PERIOD

Hes a great player Mason said PERIOD Hard shots are good shots for him. self had praise for the way Mason defended Hield after the game PERIOD

He could have gotten  points if Frank Mason wasnt guarding him Self said PERIOD

Hields effort was flanked by a career night from Sooners guard Jordan Woodard PERIOD The junior had  points  including six made threepointers  and seven dimes PERIOD

Woodard was particularly effective in clutch moments PERIOD He hit a pair of threes at the end of the first half to give OU a lead after trailing by as many as  PERIOD

We got ourselves in a bit of a hole Oklahoma coach Lon Kruger said PERIOD Then we had a few better possessions and made some shots and it was a quick turnaround PERIOD I thought we handled possessions better offensively and kept them from getting out in transition which got us in the game there in the first half. kruger is referring to an  run for the Sooners that stretched the final  of the first half PERIOD Hield and Woodard combined for all  points PERIOD

Hield is now one of four Sooners to top the 45point plateau joining Waymon Tisdale  who accomplished the feat in three separate seasons  Brent Price and Stacey King PERIOD

It was one of the best no question Kruger said PERIOD He just kept grinding in the face of a very good KU team PERIOD

I applaud Buddy for being persistent and staying after it and battling like he did. success An email has been sent to  with a link to confirm list signup PERIOD
