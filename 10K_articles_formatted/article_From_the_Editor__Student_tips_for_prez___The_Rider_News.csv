9343,2016-04-05,"as James Sutphin Chamberlin and William Cogswell Whitney gazed upon the opening of the Trenton Business College in  no storm clouds loomed PERIOD Now for President Gregory DellOmo the university is facing a much different atmosphere PERIOD

The word deficit has spurted from the lips of almost every student staff and faculty member since the middle of the fall semester PERIOD Proposed program and faculty cuts shook the Rider community to pieces and left many looking for a sigh of relief PERIOD Still months after a deal was negotiated some community members in disappointment plan not to attend one of the most important ceremonies in a university presidents life the inauguration PERIOD

On April  DellOmo will officially embark on his journey as Riders seventh president and describe his vision for what he believes should be the priorities in the coming years PERIOD As students we would like to offer some points on what we envision could benefit our community and make the university thrive in future years PERIOD

Preparing for Careers

Obviously Rider needs to offer programs that attract students and prepare them for their futures PERIOD This means getting more programs in the works that are in line with what the job market is looking for right now PERIOD

In his town hall in February DellOmo listed new programs in Sport Management Healthcare Management Allied Health Studies Organizational Psychology Health Sciences Homeland Security Technical Theater and Sports Media which are underway or expected to be launched in  PERIOD He also mentioned proposed programs in Healthcare Policy Creative Arts Therapy and Healthcare Communication PERIOD All these programs are a great start PERIOD But to become an even more robust university we need to consider adding such realms as engineering computer science and nursing PERIOD Programs like those are in the  most popular college majors according to The Princeton Review PERIOD They could bring many students to the university PERIOD

An increase in enrollment through new program offerings could reduce that very deficit that put us on such a rocky path last fall PERIOD A catalog sprinkled with new interesting undergraduate and graduate opportunities could increase student diversity attracting to Rider engaged students open to different disciplines PERIOD

Enhancing Campus Facilities

To a prospective student the campus faade is highly important PERIOD You want to feel you belong at a university not only through the people you meet but also because of the sights you see PERIOD This is where facilities renovation is key to bringing in more students PERIOD In the summer it is planned that Sweigart Auditiorium the Science building and Moore Library will undergo refurbishment PERIOD The Campus Mall and Bart Luedeke Center Bookstore will also get spruceups PERIOD Three residential houses will receive boiler replacements PERIOD Gee Hall will start a yearlong renovation PERIOD

Most of the dorms need updating especially to fix the tendency to overheat yearround PERIOD We also need cosmetic work to hide chips in the paint and replace outlets that dont work in our academic buildings hallways PERIOD

As prospective students walk by on tours and see some of our subpar dorms they might grimace PERIOD In that case what they dont see beyond our cracks are the fantastic faculty and courses we have to offer PERIOD They dont see the amazing experiences they will have PERIOD Lets fix the facilities issues and move past them PERIOD

Fostering a Communitybased Culture

The university should pride itself on giving back to the community and sharing its deeprooted connections with Lawrenceville Princeton and Trenton PERIOD A top priority for the president should be to strengthen relations PERIOD Riders economic vitality as well as our social and cultural attributes are already benefits but theyre almost invisible to people off campus PERIOD

The university should find more ways to mutually benefit from partnering with state and local agencies in different projects PERIOD We should also encourage alumni involved within their own communities to help spread the word about Rider and what an impact it has made on their lives PERIOD
Uplifting Morale

Vice presidents deans and other administrators should come out of their offices every day and see what is happening on the campuses PERIOD It would reinvigorate attitudes and lighten spirits PERIOD If the people who run this university would cast their smiling faces in every corner of Rider the institution would have a better atmosphere PERIOD

As the president stands before the community and pronounces his vision for the university he should keep some key aspects in mind PERIOD The financial shortfall that the university has seen and the reactions that the cutback announcements the president evoked need to be mended before he can proceed PERIOD Meanwhile the community needs to be reminded that the university can still implement unique projects such as the new hedges in front of Moore Library PERIOD To us despite our kidding around on page  that beautification effort represents fresh growth as well as photo ops for all PERIOD Can you dig it

Inaugurating only the seventh president in  years marks a momentous occasion one that should be celebrated with Rider pride PERIOD
