5911,2023-07-11,"immunization is recommended by the World Health Organization the Center for Disease Control the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a whole bunch of other experts PERIOD Scientifically speaking the myths about vaccines have been debunked they do not cause autism infants can indeed handle them natural immunity is not better and herd immunity is a thing PERIOD In credible scientific circles there is no debate PERIOD



Unfortunately thats not true for the rest of the public conscious PERIOD In Texas one of  states with vaccine exemptions avoiding immunization is pretty easy to do and more and more parents are opting their kids out PERIOD



Sherry Bell is the senior program coordinator of University Health Services Consumer Education and Outreach PERIOD Bell and her team at UHS cant provide opinions about policy or political movements PERIOD However she did say parents and students are able to opt out through a statemandated form PERIOD



While students are strongly encouraged to consult with a physician about the need for immunizations before requesting an exemption Texas law provides a method for students  to obtain an exemption from vaccine requirements for reasons of conscience including religious beliefs Bell said in an email PERIOD



Since  theres been a 19fold increase in the number of children entering Texas schools unvaccinated PERIOD And surprise theres also been a rise in outbreaks of contagious diseases PERIOD



But if the science is so clear why do entities like the Texas Republican Party whose  Party Platform supports exemptions persist in ignoring it Why is the Bexar county district attorney still making Youtube videos for antivaxxing It has something to do with psychology PERIOD



According to Dr PERIOD Art Markman and Dr PERIOD Bob Duke from NPRs radio show Two Guys on Your Head when personal beliefs and science are in conflict people often chose to resolve the dilemma by rejecting science PERIOD Markman and Duke explain this theory using climate change as the example but its also applicable to the antivaxxer movement PERIOD



When science says one thing but an individual doesnt want it to be true it creates cognitive dissonance PERIOD Because if it turns out the science is right the individual is a jerk PERIOD But if you can convince yourself that the science which you might not fully understand is wrong youre no longer a jerk in your own head at least PERIOD



This method of satisfying your cognitive dissonance is actually a pretty horrible idea because it means more and more people can deny science which will work against us in the long term PERIOD

One father writes on his blog The Peoples Chemist After all if vaccines truly worked then why would vaccinated kids be at risk from my unvaccinated children



This is simply misunderstanding the science behind immunizations PERIOD Vaccines are not  effective every time because thats scientifically impossible in medicine PERIOD Luckily scientific sources are pretty clear about this PERIOD Many vaccines are about  effective but as long most people are vaccinated it protects those who received an ineffective vaccination PERIOD



What it comes down to is this by not vaccinating your child you put other children at risk too and thats just a jerk move PERIOD So next time you have some cognitive dissonance to resolve please err on the side of science PERIOD
