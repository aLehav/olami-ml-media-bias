The Roadrunner Cat Coalition RRCC is a volunteerbased facultystaff organization focused on maintaining and caring for the felines populating the UTSA campus PERIOD The organization was founded in  after current Treasurer Karen Williams spotted a cat on campus PERIOD

I saw a cat down below the Business building patio and it looked like it was injured and so thats probably the first time I realized there are cats that live here Williams said PERIOD We started feeding the cats and then we started asking around and finding out that there are other cats around campus and there were at that time a couple of other individuals who had been feeding the cats in different places. as time went on they began to create their own organization dedicated to the cats PERIOD

We just got more organized and then we formed the Cat Coalition PERIOD Just like the student organizations have to register every year PERIOD We have to register every year Williams said PERIOD Were basically faculty and staff and we started getting more organized feeding them and then organized a massive trapping effort so that we could get them neutered and get their rabies shots. from there the group decided the next step would be to spay and neuter the cats PERIOD According to Williams when the organization first began caring for the cats there were between  and  around campus so getting the cats fixed helped stabilize the population PERIOD Currently there are  cats that are cared for by the coalition PERIOD

The organization has a schedule that indicates when each member is set to feed the cats at their respective locations PERIOD In addition the feeder for the day sends an email to the coalition letting them know the cats have been fed and also updating about any new cats injuries or if a cat has gone missing PERIOD

We feed them every day even when there is bad weather PERIOD Last year when we had that really bad cold freeze and it was like frozen for days somebody got out here every day but there was only one day that somebody wasnt able to get out PERIOD We are pretty dedicated to taking care of them Williams said PERIOD

The coalition does not receive any money from the university and operates solely on a volunteerbased system PERIOD The organization does have an Amazon wishlist on their Facebook page where folks can donate PERIOD Alternatively individuals can donate directly to the cats veterinary bills should they become ill injured or need to be neutered or spayed PERIOD

Although the coalition is certain about how many cats are currently on campus they are less certain about how they end up there in the first place PERIOD Some cats were born on campus they speculate that some come from across UTSA Blvd PERIOD from apartments and the nearby subdivision while some are dumped on campus PERIOD Others come from students who live on campus PERIOD

I think they are getting more lax about students having pets in their rooms but before students werent allowed to have them but they would get them anyway and then one of the cats I have is from campus and were like  sure she was from a dorm Williams said PERIOD

Williams recalled an incident that occurred a few years ago PERIOD The coalition received a call from university facilities because there was a cat wandering the halls of Chisholm PERIOD There were not any cats registered for that floor so they are fairly certain the cat belonged to a student PERIOD

The particularly friendly cats are fostered by a member of the organization and then placed for adoption PERIOD If a cat is ready to be adopted an email will be sent to the coalitions mailing list or posted on their Facebook page PERIOD

Usually its word of mouth or right from the email list of supporters on campus PERIOD And then we all have our own connections too because a lot of the other people rescue in their own neighborhoods Williams said PERIOD

Williams addressed the emotional toll this takes on those in the organization PERIOD

Weve invested a lot of emotional energy PERIOD When you rescue these little kittens and take care of them you want them to be safe and not have to go out back to the outside Williams said PERIOD So were pretty particular. williams who has seven cats herself explained her favorite part about working with the coalition PERIOD

Its the cats and everybody will say that PERIOD Sometimes thats the best part of your day especially when youre having a bad day PERIOD You know youre helping them especially the ones you know and the ones that have been here you build a relationship with Williams said PERIOD Ive taken care of some of these cats on campus like the ones that were born here longer than some of the ones that are my own pets PERIOD You develop a relationship with them even though theyre feral cats and most of them you cant pet PERIOD I feel good about being able to help them but mostly its just seeing those cats and theyre the ones that come running and the ones that will let you pet them and its great. williams also mentioned her favorite part was meeting catlovers from all over campus PERIOD

We have the Associate Dean of Honors College multiple faculty members people who are directors of programs we have people all over in all colleges the staff the facilities people the maintenance people the grounds people the Police Department people PERIOD Some of these are people I would have never spoken to Williams said PERIOD So meeting all the really great people oncampus in all these different areas you know who have helped with the cats and who will call us PERIOD The people in parking and transportation that give you the tickets they know my car PERIOD Theyre not gonna give me a ticket PERIOD They know Im there to feed the cats. for those who would like to get involved in the coalition the easiest way to do so is through donating and volunteering to feed PERIOD Individuals can also join the mailing list and receive the coalitions newsletters and Christmas cards PERIOD To join the list email emailprotected PERIOD

Bella is a firstyear political science major PERIOD She has a passion for learning helping and connecting with others and thinks writing is one of the best.. PERIOD
