After earning Big  Offensive Player of the Year for the second consecutive season earlier this fall Nebraska sophomore Morgan Marlborough was named a secondteam AllAmerican by the National Soccer Coaches of America Association on Monday PERIOD

By being named to the second team Marlborough is the Cornhusker soccer programs seventeenth AllAmerican in the  years since the programs inception PERIOD

Marlborough led the Big  in goals assists and points this year en route to the top Big  honor but NU coach John Walker believes the difference this season was her willingness to improve PERIOD

 Walker said PERIOD



The AllAmerica honor comes just after Marlborough and fellow sophomore Jordan Jackson were named to the NSCAA AllCentral Region team with Marlborough earning firstteam honors while Jackson was named to the third team PERIOD

Even though shes just a sophomore Marlborough already ranks in the top  in school history in both goals and points PERIOD

Marlborough also finished in the top  nationally in points per game second goals per game fourth and assists per game seventh PERIOD

 Walker said PERIOD
