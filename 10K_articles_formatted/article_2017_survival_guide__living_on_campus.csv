9492,2017-08-08,"i have to share a bathroomgross PERIOD Whats the best way to deal with the communal bathroom situation
The dreaded shared bathroom PERIOD Sure you had to share a bathroom with your little brother back at home but sharing one with a stranger Now thats a whole different ballgame you say PERIOD The best way to keep your bathroom clean and conflictfree is to create a bathroom cleaning schedule with your roommatessuitemates at the beginning of the semester alternating the weeks that you and your roomie are each responsible for cleaning the bathroom PERIOD Also make sure to keep the bathroom clutter free so those who share it with you arent tripping over the sweaty gym clothes you discarded on the floor right in front of the shower PERIOD If someone is slacking on their bathroom cleaning duties dont be passive aggressive PERIOD Instead explain your frustrations to your roommate in a polite but direct manner PERIOD If the bad bathroom etiquette continues your RA is always there to help mediate conflicts PERIOD

I cant find parking anywhere Any advice for a frustrated driver
Ask any Towson student with a car and theyll probably tell you that parking at Towson iswell not great PERIOD Depending on the time of day it can be pretty difficult to find an empty parking space on campus PERIOD But fear not hope is not all lost The best way to snag a spot is to avoid peak parking hours PERIOD The parking garages begin filling up by midmorning anddont start substantially emptying out until mid to lateafternoon PERIOD During that busy period give yourself at least  minutes before your class begins to hunt for a parking space PERIOD As TU administrators are likely to tell you theres also plenty of space at the SECU lots PERIOD While those lots are a little out of the way there is a shuttle that will pick you up and drop you off at the main part of campus PERIOD

Im a commuter student but Im worried that I wont be as involved on campus as some of my friends who live here PERIOD Do you have any advice for commuters in my situation
Its easy for commuter students to fall into the routine of merely coming to campus for classes and leaving as soon as their last class lets out but wheres the fun in that Get involved with clubs and other groups on campus where you can find people with similar interests as you PERIOD If you dont have time to consistently dedicate to a student organization try to attend some events on campus occasionally to meet fellow students and TU community members have some fun and maybe even learn a thing or two PERIOD Also quadruple check that you have everything you need for the day before leaving the house in the morning PERIOD Sure that means textbooks and the usual classroom materials but it also means checking the weather in the morning to figure out whether you need a sweater or an umbrella packing some snacks and a refillable water bottle for the day ahead if you dont want to spend money on campus food and phonelaptop chargers for when youre running out of juice and the free charging station in the University Union is all full PERIOD Resident students might look at you funny for toting around your Hermione Grangeresque bottomless bag but hey preparation is the key to success right

Im pretty much broke right now but I really need some money to go out with my friends PERIOD Where do I find or apply for a job
The easiest way to find and apply for a job is to go to the Career Centers online job database which is called Handshake PERIOD You can find all kinds of jobs and internships available based on your search filters and your employment needs including workstudy programs PERIOD Handshake can be found on the Towson University website if you type Handshake into the search bar PERIOD From there youll find helpful pages of student FAQs guidelines when it comes to submitting applications and the Handshake database itself Ifa job you want isnt listed on Handshake dont sweat it  employers on campus arent mandated to post job listings there PERIOD You can go in person and inquire about position openings to places like the Cook Library the Writing Center and organizations such as The Towerlight Additionally once you get more involved other positions can open up  being a member of the the Honors College gives you the opportunity to be a Student Director and studying abroad gives you the option to become a Study Abroad Peer Advisor PERIOD There are plenty of opportunities for jobs on campus if youre looking

Honestly all this meals and points talk has me pretty confused PERIOD How does my meal plan work
Meal plans are super confusing when you first look at them but trust me it gets easier PERIOD If youre a commuter you can sign up for a block meal plan PERIOD Block meal plans allow you to have a set amount of meals for a semester and its up to you to pace yourself through them PERIOD Otherwise you get the choice of    or unlimitedmeal plans where you get   or  meals a week and you can pace yourself in smaller increments or an unlimited number of meals and just go crazy PERIOD A meal on campus will cover whatever you get at any dining hall for as long as you stay there and at most places like Au Bon Pain and Newell Den theyre the equivalent of . pERIOD Those meal plans reset every week on Friday at  a.m PERIOD These plans also come with what we call dining points which is basically cash you put into your account and are super helpful when your meals total comes to something like . if you use a meal to cover the six dollars your points will cover the  cents left over PERIOD To check your meal plan and points head over to the Towson University website type OneCard account into the search bar click on Ticket Office OneCard  Business Office and scroll all the way to the bottom where a hyperlink OneCard will redirect you to the proper website PERIOD

There are so many food options on campus that its hard to decide where to eat PERIOD Which places do you recommend
Oh boy this is a great question PERIOD Here at The Towerlight we love our food and it was hard to come to a definitive answer PERIOD Really it all depends on your tastes.The Unions Susquehanna Food Court has plenty of options ranging from a personal pizza station to sushi to ChickFilA PERIOD Paws also located in the Union has some great fries and there are sometimes some cool events happening there in the evenings.Au Bon Pain or ABP offers fresh sandwiches salads and soup along with a coffee bar PERIOD In our completely subjective opinion ABP has the best lemonade and chai lattes on campus.Out in West Village youll find Einstein Bros PERIOD Bagels Panda Express and Jamba Juice all of which are pretty good but at peak hours the lines are usually pretty long.However one spot stands out to us year after year and thats Patuxent Bistro otherwise known as PTux.The lines get pretty long since its only open for a limited time each day but the food makes up for that PERIOD At PTux you can enjoy a pasta station a sandwich station a salad bar a burrito station and a Chinese food station but make sure you get there early so youre not standing in line for your entire lunch break.And if youre looking to watch the next big football game in the company of fellow students and a huge plate of crab dip and for our  and over crowd maybe a beer or two look no further than Bill Batemans located on the side of the  York Rd PERIOD building.What can we say Towson has plenty of options for plenty of tastes PERIOD Make it your mission to try them all before the semester ends PERIOD

Ive heard so many roommate horror stories and Im scared I wont get along with mine PERIOD How can I keep the peace with my roommate
We get it PERIOD Living with a roommate can be tough but its important to remember that its a twoway street PERIOD Make your best effort to be a good roommate and things may fall into place PERIOD Take some time to understand each others needs PERIOD You may like watching T.V PERIOD until  a.m. but your roommate may like going to bed at  p.m PERIOD Make compromises and outline boundaries PERIOD Youll be living with this person for nine months so make sure you get to know them and most importantly make sure you respect each other PERIOD The most important thing about having a roommate is recognizing that there will most likely be some issues throughout the year PERIOD Hopefully they wont be major problems but understand that its hard to get through an entire year in the same room as someone else without some kind of problem PERIOD It is crucial that you and your roommate dont avoid addressing these problems because itll only lead to greater conflict down the line PERIOD Be patient be respectful but be upfront PERIOD On your end make sure that you maintain healthy habits while youre living in the dorm PERIOD Take your trash out dont let your laundry pile up shower and wash your sheets PERIOD Itll make the whole experience more pleasant PERIOD If your problems with your roommate escalate to a level where you feel they cant be solved talk to your RA PERIOD Theyll help you work it out and you can always switch rooms in the spring PERIOD

Im freaking out because I lost my OneCard What do I do
Hey there Its okay You can head to the ticket booth in the Union and theyll replace your card for you PERIOD Keep in mind that theyll charge you  to replace the cards the first two times you lose it...the price gets much higher after that so try to keep track of your card.The OneCard is your key to Towson University and you need it just about every day PERIOD Youll use your card to get into your residence hall to buy meals and snacks to check out materials from Cook to visit Burdick gym and athletic events to ride the shuttles and to print on the WEPA kiosks.Sounds like a lot huh Wed suggest taking your card off the lanyard that youve been given and finding another place to store it PERIOD One great idea is to buy one of the phone pockets that you can stick to your phone case PERIOD As long as you dont forget your phone you wont forget your OneCard PERIOD

Im really afraid of gaining the dreaded Freshman . how can I make sure I stay healthy while Im at school
This is definitely a valid concern PERIOD Coming to college brings some serious schedule changes and its important to make an effort to keep your physical and mental health in check PERIOD In terms of your physical health Towson has plenty of food and fitness options to help you stay healthy.You can find healthy meal options at basically any of the dining halls and cafeterias and sometimes you can substitute less healthy ingredients for better ones PERIOD For example at Kappa Sushi in Susq you can ask for brown rice instead of white rice and at a lot of dining halls you can substitute for things like wholewheat pasta or eggwhites.Towson also has oncampus dieticians who can give you a hand in figuring out the best food for you.Burdick Hall is a great place to work up a sweat when youre looking to burn some calories PERIOD Granted the building is still under construction but youll find multiple gyms a pool fitness classes and other workout resources.The buildings expansion is slated to be completed in December  and when its done therell be even more facilities to use.Towsons Health Center at Ward and West is a great resource to use for anything from the common cold to a serious medical emergency PERIOD In addition to treating illness and injury the Health Center offers services like STDtesting contraceptive counseling and immunizations.However on top of your physical health your mental health is equally important PERIOD The Counseling Center is located on the second floor of Ward and West and theyre here to help.You can make an appointment by calling  or by stopping by the front desk PERIOD They offer both individual services and initial visits as well as several group counseling sessions.The Counseling Center can help students in crisis during regular business hours Monday through Friday from  a.m PERIOD to  p.m PERIOD However outside those hours they recommend calling  if someones health or safety is at risk.College is a stressful time and its hard to stay on top of the various aspects of your health PERIOD However Towsons resources can help you keep it all in check PERIOD

I hate to admit it but I really really miss home PERIOD My roommate is driving me up the wall and I miss my dognot to mention the stress of the everyday hustle and bustle of college PERIOD Please help
We hear ya and believe it or not were in the same boat with you PERIOD As cliche as it sounds to say everyone gets homesick PERIOD For  years of our lives we have had a pretty constant and stable routine and to have it thrown off all of the sudden can be a major shock to yourpsyche PERIOD This is a difficult question to answer because one size doesnt necessarily fit all PERIOD For those of you living in dorms or in nonpet friendly apartments there is a Just Puppies on York Road if you miss your dogjust saying PERIOD Our best advice is to not deny that you are homesick PERIOD Suppressing our feelings is one of the worst things that we can do as human beings PERIOD Talk to your parents friends or other loved ones if you are struggling and just remember you are stronger than you even can fathom PERIOD
