Q Some studentsclub leaders are unsatisfied with SGA regarding event hosting and funding PERIOD What will SGA do to help these clubs that dont feel heard or feel like they are not getting the timely responsefunding they need for events

A In addition to providing opportunities for clubs to voice their concerns  like the open meeting we held on March third  I would propose further solutions for the future PERIOD At the beginning of each semester the Director of Finance Chair of Allocations and the Leisure Student Organizations Senator would host a meeting with either the President of each club or a representative to give a presentation on the funding process PERIOD

This would create more transparency to how SGA funding works as well as foster an initial connection between SGA and student clubs PERIOD I believe it would be beneficial to include a Frequently Asked Questions page to the SGA website in order to provide more streamlined specific and detailed information to the student body PERIOD I believe this would get rid of any mysteries of the funding process and foster greater trust between the student body and SGA PERIOD

Q What initiatives are you planning to increase diversity equity and inclusion DEI efforts on campus

A The DEI Committee for SGA which I currently sit on has been working on an initiative for the past year to create an inventory of current and planned DEI efforts across campus PERIOD This would keep the university accountable for both strengthening and adding DEI on campus PERIOD If elected for this position I would prioritize continuing both this project and SGAs relationship with the Office of DEI PERIOD As for a new initiative that I am interested in pursuing I want to increase support for the LGBTQ community on campus PERIOD My ideas are in the very early stages of development but with the help of the Office of DEI I believe that we can create a more welcoming and academically supportive environment for this community PERIOD

Q What is one thing that you would want to change about Chapman and how SGA is running currently How would you go about this

A One thing that I want to change about how SGA is running currently is the communication and presence of SGA in relation to the student body PERIOD I feel that there is a large disconnect and students are not aware of how SGA has and is supporting the Chapman community PERIOD One way that I would go about changing this is by making current and past initiatives more known to the student body PERIOD While they are provided on the SGA website I think it would be beneficial to provide monthly updates to the student body about what initiatives are being worked on so everyone can stay informed PERIOD

Another addition that I think would be beneficial would be to have a form on the SGA website that students could fill out PERIOD This would allow for student voices to be better heard in terms of what kind of initiatives or changes they want to see on campus PERIOD

Q Since the topic of mental health is so prevalent across campus what mental health initiatives would you want to put into place if you are elected to your position

A A mental health initiative that I would want to put into place is providing free journals for students that are geared toward mental health PERIOD I would find journals that either have writing prompts in them or will be supplemented with writing prompts to help students begin their journaling and have guided thoughts PERIOD Journaling is found to be effective in coping with mental stressorssymptoms and improving mood PERIOD

Another initiative that I would be interested in looking more into and pursuing if it does not already exist would be to create a mental health module for professors so they can be more knowledgeable about the mental health crisis that college students are facing PERIOD This would foster greater empathy and understanding between students and faculty and hopefully improve communication for when a students mental health impacts their academic performance PERIOD

Q What is the one overarching goal you hope to accomplish if elected into your position

A One overarching goal that I hope to accomplish if elected is that of enhancing sustainability at Chapman PERIOD While the university has made efforts to improve its sustainability efforts I believe there is still more to be done PERIOD Being located in a state that is a growing leader in sustainability I believe that we have not only the opportunity but the responsibility to follow suit and establish sustainability as one of Chapmans core values PERIOD Currently sitting on the Sustainability Committee which works closely with the Office of Sustainability I have the resources and knowledge to know what needs to be done and if elected I would work to strengthen these current departments and further the work they have been doing PERIOD

Q Some studentsclub leaders are unsatisfied with SGA regarding event hosting and funding PERIOD What will SGA do to help these clubs that dont feel heard or feel like they are not getting the timely responsefunding they need for events

A SGA finance is an area within our operations that has immense potential but needs some extra hands on deck to ensure it functions as it should for the optimal support of student organizations PERIOD One of the first and easiest things we can do is work with our team of allocationsfinancestudent organization senators to start an open dialogue with any and all club representatives who wish to take part and loop them into a deep evaluation of our allocations operating documents to see where necessary changes should be made that all are in agreement on PERIOD

From there I believe the structuring of the funding application itself can be altered to reduce redundancy and ensure that all information SGA may need to make an informed funding decision is accounted for to reduce waiting time postsubmitting application where we must chase after documents ask clarifying questions and do things that extend the time for a group to hear back from us PERIOD There is often a disconnect between senators sitting on the Allocations Committee and senators who are not in terms of knowledge of our financial procedures to which I feel everyone should go through the same thorough training and be as knowledgeable as the next about our funding policies as to mitigate the spread of misinformation  and allow additional senators to step into Allocations meetings if necessary to improve efficiency PERIOD

In addition we can definitely communicate where our role ends and where Financial Services nonSGA begins as there is some misunderstanding as to what we are and are not in charge of that leads to misguided frustrations at times PERIOD But more than anything there needs to be a better line of consistent communication between SGA and individual student organizations about the state of their funding requests rationales for why things are done a certain way and a space for concerns to be brought up and addressed immediately PERIOD

Q What initiatives are the candidates most interested in funding andor creating in order to improve a positive campus atmosphere

A Something I have worked on for the past few semesters that I hope to really expand is addressing the lack of physical accessibility around campus as well as how we communicate the accessibility features of different spaces to students PERIOD Many buildings on and off of main campus Crean Hall Smith Hall Hashinger Science Center etc. lack robust accessibility features and some even have unnecessary barriers to entrances that make the space inaccessible to many PERIOD

Working with Campus Planning to address these concerns in upcoming campus renovations is a top priority in addition to revamping our current practices for making sure the features of every building are known from more transparent mapping to better visibility of accessible parking spaces to clarified building details during the room reservation process PERIOD

Another pillar that is of importance to me is reviving a previous SGAs climate action plan which has been idle for some time and working with the Office of Sustainability to continue finding ways to reduce our environmental impact PERIOD Lastly I am eager to explore ways to improve the academic experience for undergraduates as this is the number one thing we are all at Chapman for PERIOD From finding solutions for growing class sizes to implementing toolsmaterials to support the academic advising process and transition to college for firstyear students there is much to be done to ensure that our experience in the classroom is just as good as our experiences outside of it PERIOD

Q What initiatives are you planning to increase diversity equity and inclusion DEI efforts on campus

A I want to preface by saying that I hold firmly that DEI initiatives across campus should not be regarded as a completely exclusive category of work but rather something that is integrated into everything we do as an SGA constantly ensuring that our actions are in the best interests of expanding the presence of DEI on campus PERIOD Firstly with the current search underway for a director of LGBTQIA achievement within the Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion SGA has a very exciting opportunity to support the hired individuals transition to campus and establish a connection from day one to see what their needs and visions are for the Chapman community and where we can step in and be of service to help carry out these goals PERIOD

Something that has been ongoing that I really hope to continue flourishing is ensuring Sodexos policies equitably support all students providing exemptions for offcampus food for ethniccultural based meals and events expanding food access to accommodate individuals during times of religious fasts etc. pERIOD There are a plethora of areas of growth to look into and a lot of that can stem from better internal addressing of DEIrelated matters within SGA whether that be examining whether our election policies and procedures are inclusive of as many students as possible or better training senators on how to view their own roles through a lens of equity and inclusion PERIOD

From there we must also look at how stafffaculty play into this equation and advocate for more comprehensive and consistent DEI and safe space training across campus so as to not put the responsibility of the entire state of DEI in the hands of the Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion but rather invest the entire campus in its advancement PERIOD

Q What is one thing that you would want to change about Chapman and how SGA is running currently How would you go about this

A I see one of SGAs biggest challenges in terms of internal operations to be adequate training of new senators and supporting the transition between senators leaving office and those stepping in PERIOD We historically have had a few summer meetings to overview SGA as a whole and what our role is as general student advocates and representatives however positionspecific training has been overlooked PERIOD Id like to implement mandated transition meetings between outgoing and incoming senators as well as more senatorspecific workshops regarding topics such as helpful campus contacts for specific senate seats tips and tricks to starting a successful initiative and anything else that would help acclimate students to their new jobs PERIOD

I also feel there has been an assumption in years past that the senator training process is the job of the Vice President however I feel strongly that it is an allhandsondeck mission and requires the full investment of the Executive Council PERIOD I hope to start weekly executive council office hours in which senators have an additional space to chat with anyone on exec about projects they may be working on brainstorm ideas and get guidance and assistance from any of our members PERIOD

This way we are also able to advise students when an idea they have is something that is already being worked on or has been exhausted in the past as to streamline efficiency and save timeefforts being put into projects that may not make it off the ground PERIOD Bridging this disconnect between senate and exec will greatly uplift our capacity to carry out meaningful work for the student body and starts with a more intentional investment in the way we support senators stepping into their roles PERIOD

Q Since the topic of mental health is so prevalent across campus what mental health initiatives would you want to put into place if you are elected to your position

A Something I am excited to explore is advocating for the expansion of our current Student Psychological Counseling Services SPCS to adopt a telemental health supplement PERIOD Our SPCS staff can be spread thin at times making it difficult for students to access the necessary support especially during peak times that may bring about additional challenges holidays finals etc. pERIOD There are a number of telemental health services available at this time so whether it be an advocacy initiative or a financial investment on SGAs end I think bringing comprehensive telemental health to Chapman will not only serve more students but also allow for students to be connected with a more diverse profile of mental health professionals better equipped to support individuals of varying identities PERIOD

On a smaller scale while SGA is not an organization focused on event planning in which there are a number of ways Chapman can organize spaces to better our mental wellbeing I hope to take a look at current university policies practices regarding where mental health meets academics and work to ensure that our procedures are in the best interests of the mental wellness of students PERIOD

Q What is the one overarching goal you hope to accomplish if elected into your position

A Though more ideological in nature and less tangible than some of the other pillars of my campaign I have a strong desire to drastically increase transparency and accountability within SGA both externally and internally PERIOD So much of the time the student body only learns of SGAs endeavors when they are very widescale projects or through word of mouth leaving the smaller initiatives and accomplishments unseen and causing confusion as to why we have the roles and budget we do and what we are doing with it PERIOD

We can and should do a better job communicating our active lines of work and advocacy to keep the student body in the know and reassure that we are not throwing our elected positions to waste PERIOD This also comes with financial transparency and finding creative ways to inform the student body of the funds that are available to them where they go and why they go to certain places PERIOD Within SGA itself there is often a lack of communication regarding who is working on what allowing senators to fall into states of complacency and not serve their constituency to the degree they should PERIOD

All SGA members senatorial executive etc. should be held to higher standards of sharing their progress actively seeking new ways to serve and being held accountable when they are not upholding the commitment they made to their constituency PERIOD I hope to create a Student Government Association that is honest and proactive that the Chapman community feels connected to and proud of and that gets back to our roots of uplifting and enhancing the undergraduate experience to the best of our abilities PERIOD
