3730,2019-12-18,"with the hiring of new head coach Jeff Hafleynew both to Boston College football and to being a head coachthe accelerated recruiting schedule could have spelled disaster for BC football PERIOD Being in the middle of a major transition could ward off potential recruits or cause them to hold off on signing PERIOD Even so on Wednesday morning the first day of the official signing period BC football and teams across the country looked on as nine players signed their national letters of intent to play for the Eagles next year PERIOD

A mix of one fourstar and eight threestar recruits earned BC a recruiting class ranking of No PERIOD  in the nation and No PERIOD  in the ACC per 247Sports both of which are drops from this time last year PERIOD The lower number of recruits from last years early signing daywhich turned out  signeesis likely due in part to the coaching change though there is still the possibility of more recruits signing later in the year PERIOD

The incoming class of  features a balanced group of five offensive and four defensive players including two cornerbacks a pair of tight ends one wide receiver one running back one offensive tackle an inside linebacker and a defensive tackle PERIOD

The highest ranked recruit for BC so far this year is Ozzy Trapilo a fourstar offensive tackle from Norwell Mass PERIOD BC has been in his blood for years now so it comes as no surprise that he chose the Eagles though he also entertained offers from the likes of Connecticut Duke Dartmouth and Georgia Tech PERIOD Trapilo attended Boston College High School and has been going to Eagles games since he was a child so many anticipated his signing well before he had officially committed PERIOD

This PERIOD Is PERIOD Awesome.WeAreBC httpst.coXAExIRw0Ik

From the opposite side of the ball comes threestar defensive tackle Cameron Horsley PERIOD Horsley hails from Cinnaminson High School in Riverton N.J. where he was known for his ability to shed blocks and hunt down the ball PERIOD Horsley described his unofficial visit to BC as amazing though he also had offers from Buffalo UConn Kent State and Central Michigan PERIOD

Next up for the class of  is inside linebacker Korey Smith PERIOD The Woodberry Forest Va PERIOD native attended boarding school at the Peddie School in Hightstown N.J PERIOD He committed to BC all the way back on March  stating in a tweet that he wanted to find an institution that will allow him to grow as a man and help him excel in the classroom as well as groom him to be the best linebacker in the country. even though he committed under Addazio it appears that the new head coach Jeff Hafleys philosophy of competing in everything will hold true for Smith as he heads to the Heights next season.The Eagles lost a major offensive player in AJ Dillon who recently declared for the NFL draft but this class could add some more life to the movement of the ball after his departure PERIOD The class of  includes four offensive skill players in tight ends Charlie Gordiner and Hans Lillis wide receiver Taji Johnson and running back Andre Hines Jr PERIOD Gordiner another New Jersey recruit is the No PERIOD  tight end in the nation for his class while Lillis hailing from Pennsylvania sits at the No PERIOD  spot PERIOD Hines Jr PERIOD comes from Staten Island N.Y. and boasts the No PERIOD  ranking for his position PERIOD Johnson attended camps and unofficial visits at conference rival Florida State but eventually decided on BC PERIOD

The last two signers on Wednesday morning were two cornerbacks Jason Scott from Olney Md PERIOD and Denzel Blackwell from Houston Texas PERIOD Scott comes from Our Lady of Good Counsel High School where he was named first team allconference his junior and senior years PERIOD His team also took home the conference championship this season PERIOD Blackwell comes from Strake Jesuit High School where his senior season highlights included  tackles four interceptions two forced fumbles and four defensive touchdowns PERIOD

With any luck the balanced nature of the early signing class will predict the offensive and defensive balance that Hafley should hope to incorporate into the Eagles play next season PERIOD Though the early signing period yielded fewer recruits than previous years for BC the quality of prospects hasnt changed PERIOD Theres still a lot of time to fill out the class of  and a win against Cincinnati in the Birmingham Bowl could be the difference maker for high school players still on the edge PERIOD
