Ween will never be taken seriously PERIOD Most people find them silly
and immediately laugh off their music as a novelty for fans of the
strange and drugusing experimentalists PERIOD But lost in most circles
is just how musically talented pseudo brothers Gene and Dean Ween
really are PERIOD In their sendups of every musical genre known to man
while they positively take a campy attitude Ween also commonly
master the style hinting that Ween could put out an entire CD of
that kind as they did for countrywestern with 1996s  Golden
Country Greats PERIOD

The bubbly Britinspired Hey There Fancy Pants and progrock
manipulatedvoice cut Tried and True showcase the various ranges
of fun Ween have to offer yet in avoidance of their common concept
album recording Ween have assembled a record of metal explosions
jamband epics and bizarre pop creations that never mesh PERIOD Such a
direction could be excusable if the tracks consistently equaled the
bizarre bliss of past albums but Quebec finds Ween on a high
you cant quite brag about to your friends PERIOD
