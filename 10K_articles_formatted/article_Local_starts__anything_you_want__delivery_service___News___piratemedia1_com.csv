Generally clear PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



The former managers of Alfredos NY Pizza have teamed up again for a new delivery service in Greenville PERIOD

Former general manager Daniel Barrett and his partner Colby Thomas former assistant manager opened up their delivery service Lazy Pirate last week PERIOD

According to Barrett the Lazy Pirate business model is designed after a simple idea If you want something theyll deliver it PERIOD

Barrett said his delivery drivers will pick up anything with the exception of restricted drugs alcohol and tobacco PERIOD

We dont say no until the government or Greenville says no said Barrett PERIOD They wanted us to limit it to just restaurants but theres nothing in the world that says you cant order groceries from Harris Teeter and I cant come deliver them for you. this policy has led Barrett and Thomas to deliver a range of items and even providing transportation service for one customer PERIOD

Barrett said the idea for the company came to him while he was still working at Alfredos PERIOD He wanted coffee one night but could not convince any local coffee stores to deliver to him PERIOD

I decided then I was going to open a place that would deliver coffee but then I thought why should we limit ourselves to coffee said Barrett PERIOD These kids in the dorm they need everyday stuff too. barrett said he believes Greenville needs a delivery service such as his because of the amount of college students who do not have cars or do not wish to drive on weekends PERIOD

He said he thinks there is a lack of companies that will deliver to drunken college students especially since Alfredos closure on July  PERIOD

According to Barrett the delivery charge of  percent of the total order cost plus . per mile delivery fee makes his service affordable PERIOD

Barrett said his company is still small but since their beginning on July  it has made a small amount of deliveries that encourages him to pursue expanding the business PERIOD

Part of his plan to expand involves finishing the creation of the mobile application and website as well as marketing more around East Carolina University PERIOD
