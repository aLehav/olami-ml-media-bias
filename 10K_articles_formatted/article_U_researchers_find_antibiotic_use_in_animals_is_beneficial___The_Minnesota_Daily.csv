Using antibiotics in chickens bred for consumption could be beneficial for people who eat them a team of researchers found PERIOD

The team led by Dr PERIOD Randall Singer of the Universitys College of Veterinary Medicine created a mathematical model that examines the use of antibiotics in food production and found that people who consumed animals given antibiotics would be sick less often PERIOD

Singer said antibiotics have been used for decades to promote growth prevent disease or treat diseases already present PERIOD

Its such a logical relationship Singer said PERIOD Healthier animals means people are eating food with less bacteria. singers model also acknowledges that introducing antibiotics to animals bred for human consumption increases the bacterias resistance to antibiotics but he said that risk is outweighed by the benefits of antibiotic use PERIOD

The Food and Drug Administration and the Joint Expert Technical Advisory Committee on Antibiotic Resistance have also conducted studies that prove this PERIOD

But some people said antibiotic use is not at the base of the issue PERIOD

The reason these studies need to take place in the first place is because the animals are so overcrowded and are in such close proximity with no access to fresh air that theyre not solving the real problem said Jason Ketola of Compassionate Action for Animals PERIOD

Singer said he realizes that any way animals can be made healthier will improve the health of those who eat them and antibiotics are only one of those ways PERIOD

The main point to take away from this is that increases in animal illness leads to increased contamination of meat and an increase in human illness from meat consumption Singer said PERIOD

He said many previous studies focused on antibiotic resistance but this was a more holistic approach that examined the risks and benefits simultaneously PERIOD

Singer presented his findings to the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy on Nov PERIOD  in Washington PERIOD

He said he plans to validate his model by applying it to a field study possibly in a study on swine PERIOD

Singer is designing a field study that can be done on animals PERIOD He is seeking grants to fund his research PERIOD
