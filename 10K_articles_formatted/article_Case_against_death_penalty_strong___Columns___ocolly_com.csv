The death penalty is still a legal form of punishment in most of the United States PERIOD Seventeen states plus Washington D.C PERIOD have banned it but executions are still carried out in the other  PERIOD Since  Oklahoma has led the nation in most executions per capita and comes in behind only Texas and Virginia in total executions PERIOD

I dont think that the death penalty euphemistically called capital punishment is an effective tool of criminal justice because it is demonstrably ineffective as a deterrent financially unfeasible racially biased and perhaps most importantly it results in the executions of innocent people PERIOD

The United States is very much alone in its use of the death penalty PERIOD  of all global executions occur in  nations China Iran Saudi Arabia and the United States PERIOD But despite our proud use of executions as a form of justice the homicide rate in the United States is at least five times higher than in any Western European country all countries without the death penalty PERIOD This shows that the death penalty does not deter criminals from committing capital crimes PERIOD

Its no mystery why the rest of the civilized world has left the death penalty behind PERIOD Besides being ineffective at deterring crime it is also expensive PERIOD For example California has spent around  billion dollars since  on cases seeking the death penalty resulting in only  executions PERIOD Each execution therefore cost the state about  million dollars PERIOD And according to the California Commission for the Fair Administration of Justice the system would be much cheaper without the death penalty largely because of all the money spent on the appeals of a death sentence PERIOD

The death penalty is applied very disproportionately along racial lines PERIOD According to an article by former President Jimmy Carter homicide victims are six times more likely to be black than white PERIOD Yet  of death penalty cases involve white victims PERIOD This means that a killer is much more likely to get the death penalty for killing a white person than a black person PERIOD

The fact is that there is still racism in America whether we want to admit it and there are also certain social stigmas against some people due to racial stereotypes PERIOD These factors contribute to unequal distribution of the death penalty among races and that is not fair PERIOD

Most readers will agree that killing innocent people is a bad thing PERIOD On occasion the death penalty does precisely this kills innocent people PERIOD The system kills innocent people and this reason alone is enough to abolish the system PERIOD Why do we still use a system that is not effective as a deterrent financially unviable racially charged has been abandoned by the rest of the modern world and puts innocent people to death Justice is not the same thing as vengeance and the United States needs to get with the times and abolish the death penalty PERIOD
