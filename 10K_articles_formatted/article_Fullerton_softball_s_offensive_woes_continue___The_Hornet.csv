Fullerton College softball extended their losing streak to three games with a  loss at the hands of Antelope Valley College yesterday at home PERIOD

It was the second time in three games that the Hornets have been shut out PERIOD The other game was a  loss PERIOD The team has been outscored  in their last three games PERIOD

Haley Shulman pitched an incredible game for us today said Antelope Valley head coach Cindy Vargas  PERIOD We have been trying to get her to cut down on her walks and she did that today and got ahead of batters PERIOD She only walked two and that is her season low. their pitcher did an excellent job hitting her spots and not giving us a chance to get on base Mendoza added PERIOD We are not a team that is really going to overwhelm anybody with power so if we arent getting girls on we are in trouble. the Marauders jumped out to an early lead on the Hornets but it did not have much to do with the Hornets pitching PERIOD

We had a few early errors that killed us said Hornet head coach Marian Mendoza PERIOD Before we knew it we looked up at the scoreboard and we were down  before we allowed an earned run. they did not help their cause on the base paths either PERIOD They were only down  in the bottom of the fifth and they got their first two batter on base PERIOD

However after the second single Alyssa Felipe got caught in a run down between second and third base PERIOD The next two batters then got out and the little bit of momentum that they had gained was gone PERIOD

FC is already into conference play and they have gotten off to an  start PERIOD

In order to win games you need to pitch hit and play defense Mendoza said PERIOD We have not been doing any of those for the last few weeks PERIOD We will not be able to win if we dont do those. even though they have already lost to three conference opponents the Hornets keep optimism going forward PERIOD

We have lost a few games but we get to see those teams again Mendoza said PERIOD We get to see all of those teams three times and from what I have seen we are capable of beating all of them. the Hornets   will take on Saddleback today at  p.m PERIOD Saddleback is  and  in Orange Empire Conference play PERIOD A win for the Hornets would do a lot for their confidence and get them going in the right direction in the conference PERIOD

That game is crucial for us Mendoza said PERIOD We need to start doing things the right way and putting wins on the board PERIOD It is big for us to start doing so now before we get in a deep hole. your donation will support the student journalists of Fullerton College PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
