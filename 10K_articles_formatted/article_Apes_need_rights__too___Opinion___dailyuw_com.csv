Updated November     pm



As humans we share more than  percent of our DNA with our closest biological relative the chimpanzee though some scientists estimate the difference to be more like . percent than  percent PERIOD And while there is clearly a vast difference in that fraction of DNA separating a human from a chimp the similarities between the species are clear PERIOD

Chimpanzees can communicate with each other make tools display emotions and have shown the capacity to understand the passage of time PERIOD They also have their own culture which varies from tribe to tribe and helps delineate individuals PERIOD

And yet while there is still a gulf that separates us from them there is no doubt that these complex creatures our closest living relatives on the evolutionary tree deserve respect and protection PERIOD The question is how much A landmark case in Vienna Austria will help to answer that question PERIOD

Animal rights activists in Vienna are seeking to declare a 26yearold male chimp named Hiasl a person thus extending to him certain rights we would call 

There are good reasons for this due to Hiasls situation PERIOD As a baby Hiasl and another chimp Rosi were caught in Sierra Leone in  to be used in pharmaceutical experiments PERIOD Customs officials intercepted both chimpanzees and turned them over to an animal sanctuary PERIOD

The problem is this sanctuary has just gone bankrupt and people are worried about Haisl and Rosis futures PERIOD Food and vet bills cost about  a month and though donors are willing to support the chimps under Austrian law only a person can receive donations PERIOD

Establishing Hiasls legal status as a person would allow the chimpanzee to  money and have a guardian responsible for appropriating it PERIOD

Without these protections the concern is that Hiasl could be sold to someone outside Austria exempting him from the countrys strict animal cruelty laws PERIOD

 Eberhart Theier the lawyer representing the Association Against Animal Factories in court told The Associated Press PERIOD 

The activists in this case have arranged for worldrenowned primatologist Jane Goodall to speak as an expert witness for the case PERIOD Goodall lends an air of credibility to the case that is hard to discount PERIOD

The idea of rights for chimpanzees is not unheard of PERIOD Seattles own Great Ape Project aims to secure for all the great apes much the same rights as in the Hiasl case PERIOD Project members go about it differently though trying to establish apes as equal to humans not actual humans PERIOD

The problem is chimpanzees are not people PERIOD But when did we start thinking that anything not human deserves to be treated with disregard

Intrinsic to Eberharts argument is the idea that only humans deserve the right to live freely or else he wouldnt be trying to classify apes as humans PERIOD

And if the notion of classifying a chimpanzee as a person is wrong the fact that this court case is even happening points to a larger problem within Western society  we believe that we are the only things worth assigning rights to and anything else had better watch out PERIOD

Just look to the state of the planet PERIOD Endangered species of both plants and animals are toppling at unprecedented rates because of our greedy sense of entitlement PERIOD Not only have we made the earth uninhabitable to other species weve allowed global warming to get so out of hand that our way of life may eventually bring about our own extinction PERIOD

One of my bioanthropology textbooks even claims that within  years all species of great apes will be extinct if current trends continue PERIOD Hows that for shameful How tragic would it be if we destroyed our closest living relatives who happen to be the smartest animals on the planet

What Hiasls protectors need to be focusing on is a return to animal rights PERIOD Hiasl and Rosis welfare is not a human rights issue though it is an ethical one and trying to make it so is the wrong way to go about this case PERIOD Instead the activists should be focusing on primate rights PERIOD

Primates deserve the things the Association Against Animal Factories is asking for  the right to live to eat and to die without being exposed to torture or pain PERIOD

The Great Ape Project has it right apes are not people but they certainly deserve to be treated with dignity PERIOD Just because a percentage point of DNA has made humans more powerful than others in the animal kingdom does not give our species dominion over any other PERIOD
