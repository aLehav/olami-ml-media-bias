It was a rough week overall for NFLSU and you have to look past the box score to see that PERIOD This has been a tumultuous year for injuries across the league and former players from LSU are privy to that PERIOD Notable names out this past weekend included Kristian FultonCB TEN and Ethan PocicC SEA but the biggest injury sustained was to Andrew WhitworthLT LAR PERIOD

Whitworth in his 15thyear in the league tore his MCL and damaged his PCL in his left knee during the first half of the RamsSeahawks game Sunday afternoon PERIOD The injury is likely to keep Whitworth sidelined for  weeks if rehab progresses positively as the ACL was not damaged during the play PERIOD There is optimism around this as Whitworth could return to the team for a playoff push in January PERIOD

As it stands now the Rams are in a threeway record tie with the Cardinals and Seahawks second in the NFC West and sixth in NFC playoff seeding PERIOD Greg Bishop for Sports Illustrated has been checking in with Whitworth every Monday this season and will continue the coverage during his recovery PERIOD The piece published this week goes into details of Whitworths thoughts about the injury and moving ahead with rehab and potentially his career PERIOD

SI Daily Cover On Monday mornings throughout this season Andrew Whitworth checked in with GregBishopSI to share stories and talk training philosophy and longevity.After a gruesome injury suffered Sunday he looked at his football future one more time httpst.coCA0cpw71eV pic.twitter.comOl5DYSqkuk

Patrick PetersonCB AZ

Petersons box score stands as two tackles Tot two passes defended PD and one interception INT PERIOD Looking past this though Peterson had two potential interceptions that were dropped that could have put the game away early for the Cardinals PERIOD Peterson and the rest of the Cardinals secondary had a tough task trying to limit Stefon Diggs Cole Beasley and John Brown giving up  receiving yards to Josh Allens topthree receiving threats PERIOD During the final drive for the Bills Diggs beat Peterson on a corner route with  seconds left in the game PERIOD This late score given up by Peterson would have sealed the game for the Bills had the Arizona offense not scored  seconds later on a  yardHail Mary caught by DeAndre Hopkins PERIOD

TreDavious WhiteCB BUF

Speaking about that Hail Mary White and two additional Bills Defenders were on the receiving end of that Mossing by Hopkins PERIOD The Jordan logo was on full display as Hopkins went up for the ball PERIOD Expect to see that in a commercial soon PERIOD

Jordan brand value from DeAndre Hopkins glove so far  on TV online news and social is  according to ApexMarketing PERIOD pic.twitter.comzYR1mSXcmY

Outside of the one receiving touchdown White and the Bills secondary gave up all game they were able to keep the Arizona receivers quiet outside of Hopkins who had seven catches for  yards and the one score PERIOD The Arizona rushing attack did the damage racking up  yards on the ground and collectively  total yards of offensive keeping Arizonas Kyler Murray in MVP consideration PERIOD Look forward to Thursday Night Football this week as Arizona heads to Seattle PERIOD A onegame lead in the most contested division is on the line and Seattles defense needs to turn things around if they want to have a shot at the playoffs PERIOD

Jamal AdamsS SEA

Adams missed four games earlier this season after suffering a groin strain during week three PERIOD Since returning to the field he has been everywhere for the Seahawks PERIOD Adams racked up another two sacks seven Tot and a forced fumble against the Rams PERIOD Adams however did sustain a shoulder injury during the first drive and was seen heading through the tunnel with medical staff to be looked at PERIOD He returned shortly thereafter but the shoulder did seem to bother him throughout the rest of the game PERIOD Adams is likely to play Thursday and expect to see him all over the field as the Seahawks enjoy blitzing PERIOD Adams who currently has . sacks this season will likely match and exceed his career season high of . if the frequency he is sent on blitzes continues PERIOD

Joe BurrowQB CIN

The Steelers rank firstin sacks secondin turnovers and sixthin yards allowed this season heading into Pittsburgh was not an easy task PERIOD Burrow was hit nine times and sacked four times during the game Sunday as the Steelers showed why they are still undefeated this season PERIOD Burrows lone touchdown was to Tee Higgins early in the secondquarter but the offense was only able to put up  points against a stout Steelers defense PERIOD The Bengals travel to Washington this weekend and although their record does not show it  Washington is fifthin sacks and firstin passing yards allowed and will be another tough matchup for the Bengals PERIOD

Justin JeffersonWR MIN

Eight catches for  yards need I say more PERIOD The most productive member of the NFLSU was on full display Monday Night as the Vikings pulled out a victory against the Bears PERIOD Jefferson was putting defenders on skates the entire night PERIOD

Jeffersons biggest catch of the night put his speed on full display as he was able to take a 17yard pass by Kirk Cousins another 37yards down the field through multiple Bears DBs and flip field position all in the blink of an eye PERIOD

JUSTIN JEFFERSONNo DBs are safe.. PERIOD pic.twitter.comNKVm67DeRn

Griddies hit this game zero PERIOD Hopefully there will be an opportunity Sunday afternoon as the Vikings take on the Cowboys a defense who has given up the most points so far this season PERIOD

Week  will showcase some big division rivalries this upcoming weekend such as AZSEA ATLNO and KCLV but will also include some important playoff implication games like TENBAL GBIND and LARTB PERIOD Hopefully NFLSU can bounce back from this week and dont forget to set your fantasy lineups PERIOD
