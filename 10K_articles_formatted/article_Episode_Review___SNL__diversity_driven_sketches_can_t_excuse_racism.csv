In its cold open the seven hundred and fiftieth episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Kerry Washington holds a mirror up to itself PERIOD Ever since this years casting decisions came out and people realized all the new hires looked remarkably homogenous read all white mostly male the decadeslong debate over SNL s diversity problems reignited PERIOD In an undoubtedly political move the show called in Washington the first black woman to host since Gabourey Sidibe in  PERIOD

SNLKerry Washington and EminemNBC

In the opening sketch Washington appears as First Lady Michelle and the cold open quickly turns into a sardonic internal analysis of the shows race problem as Washington has to hurry out to change into an Oprah wig and costume since no one else on the show can do so PERIOD

SNL being upfront about its problems is undeniably clever but it doesnt ease my reservations with the episode overall and it certainly doesnt solve anything PERIOD Im not at all convinced its a promise to make actual change happen next time casting season comes around PERIOD Throughout the episode Washington plays stereotype after stereotype including a hood girl in a Nasim Pedraddriven sketch PERIOD The episodes best moments include a spoton MTV dating show parody and a truly wacky digital short involving icecream and an ambulance PERIOD Washington as to be expected from one of TVs most talented actors does outstanding work even when the sketches box her in and seem completely unsure of what to do with a black woman PERIOD

There was no real way for SNL to win last weekend PERIOD Thats because the shows history of racism and sexism runs deep and until SNL makes a concentrated effort to be more inclusive in its cast and writers room episodes like this just arent going to sit right with me  even when Kerry herself was nailing the comedy at every turn PERIOD
