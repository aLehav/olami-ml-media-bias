As No PERIOD  Notre Dame prepares to take on Big East rival No PERIOD  Syracuse on Saturday in Arlotta Stadium I cant help but think that this is exactly the direction in which the game of lacrosse should be heading PERIOD Tickets have already sold out for the  p.m PERIOD start time and students must go to the ticket office two days in advance to secure a seat in the stadium PERIOD Two of the countrys premier programs will square off in front of a national television audience on ESPNU PERIOD

As No PERIOD  Notre Dame prepares to take on Big East rival No PERIOD  Syracuse on Saturday in Arlotta Stadium I cant help but think that this is exactly the direction in which the game of lacrosse should be heading PERIOD Tickets have already sold out for the  p.m PERIOD start time and students must go to the ticket office two days in advance to secure a seat in the stadium PERIOD Two of the countrys premier programs will square off in front of a national television audience on ESPNU PERIOD

This is exactly how lacrosse should be PERIOD It should be played in front of soldout stadiums broadcast nationally and be the highlight of a spring weekend in sports PERIOD But across the country that is not necessarily the case PERIOD

As a Baltimore native I grew up surrounded by lacrosse PERIOD The league in which my high school played was consistently one of the best in the country and I had the luxury of being able to watch great college lacrosse on TV every Saturday PERIOD

While I knew the game was primarily an East Coast phenomenon with pockets of presence in places like Colorado Ohio and California I never realized the lack of awareness for the game until I came to Notre Dame PERIOD Some people had never seen it played and still others had never even heard of it PERIOD

But I am happy to see how quickly the game is spreading PERIOD I am always hearing from friends that their high schools just started programs that students have decided to start playing interhall lacrosse even though they have no experience and that people are coming to the games because they are interested in learning about the sport PERIOD

It has fastpaced hardhitting precision and brute force style PERIOD It should appeal to anyone who likes hockey football or basketball PERIOD

Saturday evening will be a perfect opportunity to watch two of the nations best go head to head PERIOD The Irish   Big East stand atop the Big East standings and have a chance to finish the conference schedule undefeated PERIOD Their only loss came to a solid Penn State team in overtime back in February PERIOD

Syracuse   on the other hand has had a relatively rough season PERIOD I say relatively because many programs would love to be ranked playing on ESPN and in the running for an NCAA tournament bid PERIOD But as it is the Orange have  NCAA national championships four preNCAA national championships and  Final Four appearances in their history PERIOD They simply are not accustomed to entering their final regular season game with six losses and as a severe underdog PERIOD

The Native Americans invented lacrosse as a ritualistic war game with teams of up to  men on fields up to three kilometers long PERIOD While the Irish and the Orange will be limited to the 110yard by 60yard parameters and  members on the field we can still expect an absolute battle in Arlotta on Saturday PERIOD

And that is just the way it should be PERIOD
