I dont know when YOLO stopped being cool or what has currently replaced it PERIOD I know that today I use words phrases and abbreviations like on fleek dank memes and SJW without hesitation PERIOD

Sometime in the midst of Thanksgiving break my parents said that they were baffled by the string of words and phrases that I had so seamlessly dropped into conversation PERIOD

I think there are two options for what confused my parents the most PERIOD The first is that it was more the words and phrases themselves that caught them by surprise PERIOD The second is that Ive incorporated them so easily into my language  probably as a result of living on this campus PERIOD

The words that millennials have blended into our everyday vernacular are not words our parents or grandparents are even remotely familiar with PERIOD Our language represents our political leanings and our political leanings define and divide us PERIOD The socially progressive movement has made the words intersectionality oppression and privilege commonplace in discussions of social issues PERIOD

In  Fred Astaire brought to light different regional pronunciations with the catchy song Lets Call the Whole Thing Off. the songs chorus joked about differences in pronunciations You say potaytoe I say potahtoe  You say tomaytoe I say tomahtoe. the song would not be nearly as catchy if someone sang you say Altright I say White Supremacist. these words all have meaning and value but the need for the rest of society to follow the guidelines of what is PC has gotten out of hand PERIOD My parents are not the only ones confused by the words I have come to see as routine PERIOD Before dialogue can even begin we have to define every word we intend to use arguing ensues and the intended conversation never takes place PERIOD

The words trigger warning microaggression and safe space surface continually in statements put out to student bodies from various administrations PERIOD Progress will not be made if we insist on solely analyzing the world around us through the lens of our own word choices PERIOD

People with opposing viewpoints should still be able to have sophisticated and productive dialogue on topics of importance PERIOD Today it seems like people are speaking entirely different languages PERIOD

Instead of actually addressing the serious issues in our country and the world we are spending our time deliberating over our words so they dont offend anyone or rationalizing our vocabulary and how it plays into our narrative PERIOD

You can be as woke as you want but if you dismiss those who arent on board with your perspective you are not an educated progressive thinker PERIOD Youre only adding to the verbal divide thats pushing us all farther apart PERIOD

In a world where every typed character counts and every hashtag is instrumental in conveying your message it is important that the words we choose to use are words that will resonate with and educate those around us PERIOD
