One could almost sense that  periods of hockey wasnt enough to finish up the series between the No. and No PERIOD  teams in the country PERIOD And anyone who had that sense is right PERIOD With score knotted at  well head to overtime to sort this one out PERIOD  Minnesota came out in the second half ready to go PERIOD Just  seconds in Jocelyne Lamoureux fired a shot over the right should of Vetter to tie this thing up at  PERIOD  Well Minnesota definitely owned the second period as far as shots on goal and offensive pressure but it was Wisconsin that came away with the goal PERIOD With under two minutes remaining the Badgers Kyla Sanders found the net for Wisconsin to tie up the game PERIOD and then a minute later Hilary Knight went top shelf to give the Badgers the lead PERIOD The Gophers had themselves a little defensives breakdown as Wisconsin was able to put a lot of pressure on Grogan PERIOD After  complete its Wisconsin up  PERIOD  Minnesota again looks like a faster and better team than Wisconsin much like yesterday PERIOD The Gophers again got on the board first and early in the first half as Anne Schleper found the back of the net at  while Minnesota was on a 5on3 advantage PERIOD Special teams have been a plus for the Gophers as well as they killed an important 2skater advantage in the final  minutes of the first half keeping the Badgers scoreless PERIOD  Minnesota after  period of play PERIOD 

Well Im playing utility today and editing as well as rockin the womens hockey beat so blog posts will be limited but Ill keep things as up to the minute as possible PERIOD

Today is likely the most important game of the season as it essentially decides a conference champions PERIOD Granted both teams have four games remaining on their schedules however theGophers and Badgers are a combined  agains the those teams PERIOD

Well see how Wisconsin goaltender Jessie Vetter can come back today after giving up  goals yesterday and Itll be interesting to see who coachBrad James puts in the net for the Gophers today.Ill let you know when its announced PERIOD
