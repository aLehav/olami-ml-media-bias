EAST LANSING  Now
usually I dont do this but uh  give em a lil preview of the
remix PERIOD

No forget the preview PERIOD This is the remix  the remix to
Braylition. braylon Edwards I called you out PERIOD After the Indiana game in
which you stood on the sidelines for the first quarter and a half
I questioned your work ethic PERIOD I said you had created the image of a
superstar but werent giving the effort to back up that image PERIOD I
even compared you to R PERIOD Kelly PERIOD

I dont regret what I did PERIOD When I heard you told other media
members the Monday after the Minnesota game that I had
misrepresented you I didnt flinch PERIOD You the coaches and even your
father Stan gave me the impression you were struggling with the
responsibilities bestowed upon the bearer of the No PERIOD  jersey PERIOD My
column was valid PERIOD

But this is the remix PERIOD

Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce  off
my hands PERIOD

Before you had even gone to bed Friday night The Michigan Daily
had already won the first game of the weekend doubleheader 
over The State News thats  touchdowns to six touchdowns PERIOD

I played tight end for most of the night PERIOD Before the game I
wore the No PERIOD  jersey PERIOD I wanted the pressure too PERIOD For the past
three weeks building up to the State News game I had been hyping
myself as having the best hands on the team PERIOD Just put it on my
hands Ill catch it PERIOD

Until it counts PERIOD

I ran a pristine outandup  a pattern I think you should run
more often  and left my guy in the dust PERIOD Quarterback Matt Venegoni
put it over my right shoulder in the endzone PERIOD I watched it all the
way in PERIOD

Drop PERIOD

Two series later the same thing happened PERIOD Same route same
great touch on the throw PERIOD

Drop PERIOD

My team needed me to catch those balls and for some reason I
cant explain why I couldnt make the big play PERIOD Obviously Im a
sports writer for a reason PERIOD Im not you PERIOD

But I can feel you PERIOD

Dropping passes is something you really cant explain PERIOD It does
just happen PERIOD And when it does it eats and nags at you afterward PERIOD
Just ask my teammates about the personal pity party I was holding
on the sidelines PERIOD Being No PERIOD  isnt easy but the past five weeks
youve made it look that way PERIOD

The way you do the things you do remind me of my Lexus
coup PERIOD

Actually Braylon Id say youre running more like a Ferrari
Testarossa PERIOD Youve scored seven touchdowns in five games six of
those scores coming in three games against thentop10 opponents
Iowa Purdue and Michigan State PERIOD Enough said PERIOD

Youre second in the nation in touchdown receptions with 
tied with Oklahoma States Rashaun Woods and five behind
Pittsburghs Larry Fitzgerald PERIOD Woods and Fitzgerald dont have to
share the rock with guys like Jason Avant and Steve Breaston on a
regular basis which makes it a lot easier for them to inflate
their stats PERIOD

But regardless of your talented fellow receivers John Navarre
looks for you when the team needs six PERIOD Youre the key to your
teams ignition in the air PERIOD

You must be a football coach the way you got me playin the
field PERIOD

You didnt exactly toot toot or beep beep but whatever
you did to fix things up with Lloyd Carr and the other coaches it
must have worked PERIOD Youre playing the number of snaps you should
have been playing all along and look what its done for the
team PERIOD

Chris Perry is leading the nation in rushing Navarre has been
steady as always but without your acrobatic highwire acts in the
endzone I dont think you guys would have won the last four
games PERIOD

When I heard that I missed your outpouring at the press
conference after the Minnesota game where you claimed you were a
good guy and that you would return for your senior season I was
shocked PERIOD Its rare that a player in this program steps up and takes
a stand with the media PERIOD You guys arent allowed to PERIOD Did you ask
Carr to let you stand up for yourself or did he ask you Either
way I respect that PERIOD

Prophecy is on the door PERIOD

What does the future hold for you Big things if the remix of
your season and football career continues PERIOD You could be a top10
pick in the  NFL Draft with your combination of raw speed ups
and soft hands PERIOD

Whats the prophecy for your teammates Your current group could
become the first since  to make the Rose Bowl if you guys can
find a way to stay focused for three more weeks PERIOD But you already
know that PERIOD Youve been playing like its the only thing on your
mind PERIOD

Heres another thing Im sure you already know If you dont
perform like the Ferrari you can be you guys probably wont be
booking tickets to Pasadena PERIOD

Dont worry though PERIOD I know you can handle the pressure now PERIOD

J PERIOD Brady McCollough and R PERIOD Kelly did not collaborate on this
column PERIOD McCollough can be reached at
