By  Stephanie GandseyAugust  

People arrested for underage drinking in DeKalb County may have to pay  to attend counseling through the Ben Gordon Center in DeKalb PERIOD

Those charged with underage consumption now may be required to have an assessment at the Ben Gordon Center  Health Services Drive and then attend counseling PERIOD

DeKalb County States Attorney Ron Matekaitis announced the new counseling program which targets underage people who abuse alcohol PERIOD

The focus isnt on whether theyre of legal drinking age its about how they will treat alcohol Matekaitis said PERIOD

The counseling will be done in groups and each person will be required to attend three to five sessions PERIOD

Michael Flora president and CEO at the Ben Gordon Center said the program is designed not only to be a deterrent but also an opportunity to be safe in the future PERIOD

Were really trying to get at individuals who are unmotivated to change Flora said PERIOD Were trying to deter future risktaking behavior. when a person is charged with underage consumption of alcohol he or she will be assessed at the center to see which level of therapy is needed PERIOD

If someone is at low risk he or she will need  hours of therapy PERIOD A person at moderate risk needs  hours if at significant risk  hours is needed and at high risk  hours is needed PERIOD

The amount of risk is determined by how many times they have abused alcohol PERIOD

Repeat offenders will have to go through counseling again PERIOD

Our hope is that individuals caught again will go into another level of care Flora said PERIOD

Licensed therapists will run the counseling which will use motivational principles PERIOD

We want to reinforce the notion that substance abuse is not the norm Flora said PERIOD

Matekaitis sees the program having longterm incentives for participants PERIOD

Instead of being fined and sent on their way theyll get more out of this process Matekaitis said PERIOD

Laws on the NIU campus are different than city ordinances PERIOD

Lt PERIOD and Operations Commander Matthew Kiederlen of University Police said students who are found consuming alcohol while underage wont automatically be arrested and therefore will not be required to attend the counseling PERIOD

Its a matter of discretion on the part of the officer Kiederlen said PERIOD They see if the person is a firsttime offender or if this is a regular occurrence. also a Web site has replaced SUDDS Students Understanding Drinking Drugs and Self so students will be able to get suggestions and goals on how to control their problems PERIOD

Our main focus is the prevention of the problem Kiederlen said PERIOD
