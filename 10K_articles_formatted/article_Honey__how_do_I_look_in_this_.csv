Doilookfatinthisitis is common for women but equally terrible is mens affliction Dontyouthinkmypeniscouldbelargeritis. its inevitable that if you are sexually active with a male you will be confronted with one of the following statements regarding his genitalia I wish my penis were larger PERIOD I wish my penis had more girth PERIOD My balls are too small PERIOD My balls arent even PERIOD If we have kids how do you feel about circumcision

As far as balls go here are some interesting facts from the book Supersex by Tracy Cox One testicle hangs lower than the other to stop them from getting squashed as a man walks PERIOD Few are symmetrical and in  percent of males its the left thats lower and larger PERIOD

This brings to mind that song   PERIOD  PERIOD  PERIOD hang low Do they wobble to and fro Can you tie them in a knot Can you tie them in a bow  PERIOD  PERIOD . the Journal of Research in Personality studied the penises of Asian Caucasian and black men and came up with the following results Asian men are smallest averaging . inches erect followed by Caucasians with  inches and black men at . inches PERIOD

However chances are hell continue to compare himself to some . inch porn star like Ron Jeremy or Chad Hunt and feel inadequate PERIOD

If you Google penis enlargement youll get results  of  PERIOD Is this all about the guys or do the ladies also care about penis size

Lets look at the popular television drama Sex and the City. aimed at women and arguably one of the most popular television series of our time Sex and the City had a lot of gueststarring penises PERIOD

The character Samantha Jones dumps one man because his penis is too small and then dumps another man because his penis is too large PERIOD Viewers see a dissatisfied Samantha asking Is it in yet or yelling Ouch during intercourse with these men PERIOD

Ladies and gents we might say we dont care about penis size in our men PERIOD We might spout the familiar phrase Its not the size that matters but what you can do with it PERIOD But when it comes down to it dont we laugh and agree with Samantha when she dumps a man because sex with him and his penis just isnt the right fit

Going back to the familiar Doilookfatinthisitis and even Doesmybuttlookbiginthisitis its become socially acceptable normal even for women to talk about their bodyimage problems or fish for compliments with them as some might say PERIOD

I hate to admit to my own guilt in this matter but Ive probably spent hours in the last few years talking with my best girlfriend about how much we hate our boobs PERIOD

Womens bodyimage problems arent limited to fat cells anymore because men arent the only ones with selfconsciousness about their genitalia PERIOD

It recently came to my attention that some plastic surgeons including the ones on NipTuck are altering womens genitalia through an invasive surgery to fit a social standard PERIOD Apparently there is a right and wrong way to look down under for ladies as well as gents PERIOD

This phenomenon of worrying about the sightliness of our nether regions is completely ludicrous PERIOD Is there anything less attractive than someone saying Honey do my labia look feminine enough Or Wouldnt it be nice if my dick were an inch longer More importantly whats a partner supposed to say in response to questions like that without getting into trouble

One of the greatest gifts we can give ourselves and our partners besides multiple orgasms is to stop being so judgmental and instead feel confident and secure about our bodies without worrying about how we compare to societys standards of whats hot and whats not PERIOD
