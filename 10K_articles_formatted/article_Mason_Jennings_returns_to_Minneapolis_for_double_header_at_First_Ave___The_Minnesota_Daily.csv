Mason Jennings simple and raw song structures add a folky downhome charm to his style PERIOD

by  Joe KellenPublished  December  

Anyone who cites Ryan Gosling as inspiration for an album is bound to raise eyebrows but for Mason Jennings it makes sense PERIOD

His newest record Always Been came out Nov PERIOD  and its influences range from that blond heartthrob of the silver screen to Patti Smith to Bach PERIOD

I just watch for things to light up and then I gravitate towards them PERIOD I know that whatever goes into my heart and mind will come back out as music Jennings said PERIOD Its sort of like musical biodiesel. jennings wrote the entirety of the album alone at his cabin studio PERIOD When he felt ready to record in Minneapolis he emerged with a plethora of material PERIOD

On his  record Blood of Man he relied on two single microphones and GarageBand PERIOD For Always Been Jennings decided to switch it up recording at the Terrarium in Minneapolis and collaborating with producer Bo Ramsey whos worked with the likes of The Pines and Greg Brown PERIOD

I think it really benefited the album PERIOD Maybe the biggest benefit was that I could focus more on singing and the vocal performances he said PERIOD Sonically its very rich. jennings rustic folk rock embraces a touch of Americana on this latest effort PERIOD With appearances by artists like Iris DeMent and Neil Youngs drummer Chad Cromwell Always Been shifts the focus away from the SwissArmy knife approach and replaces it with something similar but more diverse like a collection of handmade silverware PERIOD

As usual Jennings plays raconteur with his lyrics PERIOD Tunes like Number of the Sun take on a somber tone lamenting the loss of someone who the singer only wants to hold close again. the albums title comes from the lyrics of the second track Patti and Robert detailing the relationship between the punk rock goddess and photographer Robert Mapplethorpe  their song has always been. the record is balanced with hoedowninducing rousers like Witness and tunes like the earnestly quiet ukulelesoaked closer Just Try. while Jennings said he digs the recording process his favorite part of making music is playing live PERIOD

I love the transcendent aspects of music PERIOD When a live show is really unifying a room sometimes from stage I can feel the whole thing kinda lift and expand he said PERIOD Thats really a great joyful connecting feeling. jennings said his passion for the art form runs so deep that he sometimes worries about not doing the material justice PERIOD

Anxieties aside the singersongwriter hopes to communicate the joy he feels while he plays PERIOD He said that Minneapolis the city where he got his start as a musician is one of the best places to accomplish this PERIOD

I love how supportive audiences are to original music he said PERIOD It is a fantastic community for artists. as for the future Jennings is keeping quiet PERIOD He prefers to focus on the present and pursue other interests while keeping the tour rolling PERIOD

When asked how he would describe himself as a musician Jennings resisted labels PERIOD

I guess I think of myself as an artist PERIOD I do visual art too and I love sports PERIOD Some sort of athleteartiststorytellermusician guy he said PERIOD

We can get down with that hybrid Mason PERIOD
