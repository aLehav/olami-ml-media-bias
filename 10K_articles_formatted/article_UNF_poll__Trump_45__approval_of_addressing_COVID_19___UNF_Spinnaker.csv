A UNF Public Opinion Research Lab poll has found  of respondents were concerned with personally contracting COVID19 PERIOD

The poll was released Monday April  and also polled respondents on approval ratings for President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis handling of response to the COVID19 pandemic PERIOD

President Donald Trump polled with  strong or somewhat strong approval  disapproved according to the poll PERIOD Among Republicans his approval is higher sitting at  PERIOD With Democrats only  approved of the Presidents response to the pandemic PERIOD

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis came away with  approval and  disapproval PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Anthony Fauci the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID and advisor to six different presidents over the years polled the highest approval numbers for addressing the pandemic  PERIOD

On the local level Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry came away with a  approval and  disapproval PERIOD

Among Republicans approval numbers DeSantis  and Trump  are doing very well despite the national criticism about their response PERIOD However no elected officials are receiving the levels of approval that Dr PERIOD Fauci has garnered Michael Binder Director of the Public Opinion Research Lab commented in a press release on the findings about the disparity between Faucis approval and the Republicans approval rating PERIOD

When asked if they were more concerned with the public health impact or the economic impact respondents indicated that they were more concerned with public health  than with the economic impact  of COVID19 PERIOD

On more political questions respondents were asked on the likelihood they would vote for Joe Biden if he was selected as the Democratic candidate PERIOD

Of the respondents  indicated they would vote for Biden  indicated they would vote for Trump PERIOD The sample pool consisted of  individuals PERIOD

I would exercise caution when looking at these numbers Binder warned PERIOD First these are registered voters  not likely voters second the campaign season has screeched to a grinding halt and people are rightly less focused on politics. for more information or news tips or if you see an error in this story or have any compliments or concerns contactemailprotected PERIOD
