Economists from the Cal State Fullerton College of Business and Economics predicted a sunny economic forecast for the rest of the year and well into  on Thursday at their Midyear Economic Forecast presentation in Irvine PERIOD

Anil Puri Ph.D. dean of the College of Business and Economics said their predictions were probably the most optimistic in recent years despite rampant uncertainty stemming from the fiscal policy in Washington D.C PERIOD

The socalled fiscal cliff decision made in the midnight hours of Jan PERIOD  as well as the sequester or acrosstheboard cuts to government spending and an averted government shutdown in the past few months has shieded investors away from placing their faith and money into the U.S PERIOD economy PERIOD

Regardless Puri said the private sector has been holding up reasonably well with U.S PERIOD real gross domestic product up . percent clocking a 14quarter full recovery from the recession four years ago PERIOD U.S PERIOD real GDP rose . percent since the second fiscal quarter of  PERIOD

However when compared to the prerecession peak in fourth fiscal quarter of  real GDP has only risen a meager . percent a paltry gain for such long period of five years according to the forecast PERIOD

We expect U.S PERIOD real GDP to continue to expand during this year boosted primarily by steady consumption robust motor vehicle sales continued business investments and rampedup construction spending particularly in the residential sector the report said PERIOD

Puri said that  started with trepidation but they believe the rest of the year will be better PERIOD

In October  before the presidential election the college held the second of their biannual economic forecast event and last Thursday Puri said everything they predicted has come to pass. overall the state of the economy is much better today than what we had in October said Puri PERIOD If anything this is probably the most optimistic forecast in the last four years than weve done PERIOD The last four to five years have been terrible for national economy and the Orange County economy as well. according to their studies unemployment will improve to . percent in  and . percent in  PERIOD

During the recession the economy lost about  million jobs and gained back about . million PERIOD According to Puri the labor market is healing slowly even though longterm unemployment is still high PERIOD

For the second part of the presentation Puri invited Mira Farka Ph.D. the codirector of the Institute for Economic and Environmental Studies and associate professor of economics at CSUF to speak more indepth about the job market and labor outlook for  and  PERIOD

Farka quoted baseball legend Yogi Berra to characterize the economy We have deep depth meaning that the U.S PERIOD economy is on a moderate climb it isnt as bullish as most economists would prefer but it is on an uptick she said PERIOD

Clearly were going toward a move in policy in cutting deficits and sort of trying to rein in and pull down our debt said Farka PERIOD

She said while U.S PERIOD real GDP has risen from a negative it is not at an inspiring level PERIOD

The national unemployment rate receded from a  percent high in October  to . percent in March  while Orange Countys rate of unemployment dropped from a high of . percent in January  to its current level of . percent in February  PERIOD

One of the main reasons for this is the dramatic collapse of the housing sector in the County which surpassed the overall slump in the nation PERIOD If that is correct we should expect the County to show a sharper recovery and faster decline in unemployment rates now that the housing market has begun to recover rather strongly in Orange County as well as nationally the report stated PERIOD

Fullerton Mayor Bruce Whitaker attended the event and said he appreciated the optimism in the shortterm PERIOD

But anyone whos looking  or  or  years out there are some problems and potholes in the roadlargely with entitlements he said PERIOD

The mayor encouraged students who are looking for jobs to stay in the area because jobs although are competitive are available in Orange County and Fullerton specifically PERIOD

So if youre already here I think Id be reluctant to tell people to try to chase their fortunes elsewhere unless there are some international possibilities he said PERIOD
