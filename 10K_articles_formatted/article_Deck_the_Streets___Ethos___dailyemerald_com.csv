Tucked away in the singlecar garage of an inconspicuous duplex in Eugene Oregon business partners and brothers Brian and Kurtis Hester effortlessly weave around each other gathering tools and staging their work area with grinders sanding pads and saw horses PERIOD The faint sound of jazz floats them through the routine as Kurtis sands and contours a blank Canadian maple skate deck before Brian applies a carbon copy stencil to the freshly prepped wood PERIOD Shortly after stenciling the sweet smell of burnt wood lightly threads its way across the room PERIOD Almost  minutes later the process culminates as Brian puts the finishing touches on the face of a threeeyed hobo the official company logo of Vagabond Skateboards PERIOD

At Vagabond the Hesters draw on the same innovative spirit that inspired many of the worlds first skateboards which were custommade by nailing discarded roller skate wheels to a twobyfour PERIOD However instead of haphazardly marrying two unlikely components together like their predecessors the brothers use oneofakind techniques like custom contouring and pyrography or wood burning to parlay used skateboards into recycled functional works of art PERIOD

Were trying to bring something new to the Eugene skateboard scene a creative outlet for ourselves and for people who want custommade boards says Brian who at  has been skateboarding for over half his life PERIOD A  alumni Brian graduated from the University of Oregon UO with a bachelors degree in digital arts a major he says laid the foundation for drafting designs of his companys unique product PERIOD

The brothers recycled creations have included titles such as Death Banana a bright yellow skateboard redesigned in the shape of a banana with glaring eyes bared teeth and a pointy flared tongue and Tuna Fish a fishshaped deck with a blue and gold scalelike pattern and anatomically correct fins PERIOD The outlines of each of the scales as well as the fins of the Tuna Fish were woodburned by hand giving it a rich mottled coloration and deep texture PERIOD In fact every board the duo produces has a custom woodburned element whether its the Vagabond logo or a handetched tree PERIOD

Wood burning sets our boards apart from other companies because its a technique that cant be mass produced Kurtis points out PERIOD At age  Kurtis is currently studying history at the UO and like his brother has been skateboarding for much of his life PERIOD

But aside from the gratification of exercising their creative talents recycling skateboards has a deeper meaning for the Hesters preservation PERIOD The North American sugar maple known for its durability and highimpact resistant characteristics is highly sought after by skateboard creators worldwide PERIOD Many other manufacturers including in the furniture home construction and maple syrup industries prize the tree for the same qualities PERIOD The brothers take pride in knowing that recycling skateboards relieves pressure from this valued species and that their concept could someday play a role in conserving the tree PERIOD

We have stacks of skateboards and our friends have stacks of skateboards so were taking advantage of a resource thats already available Kurtis says PERIOD

To date Vagabond has designed over  custom skate decks out of old skateboards donated by friends as well as new blank decks and longboards which are purchased online PERIOD The new decks are sold to skaters interested in doing tricks because the new wood is considered crisp meaning it responds better to impact PERIOD Recycled skateboards the duos first passion can also be used for tricks but are primarily intended to be used as cruisers for transportation PERIOD

Weve never made the same thing twice Kurtis says PERIOD Sometimes we use the same design but we always use different colors or put it on a differentsized board. an average recycled deck can take as many as eight to ten hours to rework but greater attention to detail means longer hours PERIOD As each new design develops used boards go through a stripping process before theyre reshaped sanded and smoothed over PERIOD After a board is prepped one of the brothers will lay out the new design prior to wood burning taping and painting it with a premium quality spray paint PERIOD

There are very few other brands that make skateboards like Vagabond says Portland skateboarder Garrett Weber PERIOD When buying a skateboard Weber who owns four Vagabond skateboards says he looks for characteristics like the quality of wood and shapetwo details he knows the Hesters pay close attention to PERIOD

Most recently Weber has been riding a skateboard called the Vagabomb which is named after the slang term skateboarders use for skating down or bombing hills PERIOD With a rounded nose and a tail cut into two triangular fins the design mimics the iconic outline of a nuclear bomb PERIOD It is also set up with 60millimeter urethane wheels for cruising PERIOD

Reflecting fondly on their companys startVagabond began in a detached threebyfive utility closet over twoandahalf years agothe Hester brothers contemplate their future PERIOD

Back then we had to run a 20foot extension cord just to get power to the building Brian says with a laugh PERIOD

In the years since the company has expanded adding a table saw and a chop saw to their repertoire of tools PERIOD They have also created a Vagabond website and sold numerous skateboards at skate parks around Eugene PERIOD

We would really like to see Vagabond grow into a fullblown skate shop someday Kurtis says PERIOD

But regardless of what the future holds the brothers plan to continue producing their custommade Oregongrown skateboards PERIOD As Kurtis says Recycling skateboards is good for the environment its good for the skate scene and its good for us PERIOD Its a win win win. ethos is a multicultural magazine that elevates the voices of underrepresented people by telling their stories PERIOD
