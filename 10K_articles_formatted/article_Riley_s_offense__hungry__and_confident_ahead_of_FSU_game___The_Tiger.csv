9300,2023-11-04,"as the Clemson Tigers gear up for a showdown against No PERIOD  Florida State offensive coordinator Garrett Riley spoke to the media on the confidence that has developed over Clemsons past two wins PERIOD

After a disappointing season opener resulted in a  loss to Duke many questioned the offensive abilities of the Tigers PERIOD Riley however sees things differently after watching his unit perform well against Florida Atlantic and Charleston Southern PERIOD

Felt like we got a feel of our team in terms of going through some adversity and getting behind the eight ball on some things and what we found out is that we have a team and guys that dont flinch Riley said on Monday PERIOD

The biggest obstacle for the offense in the opener was finishing drives PERIOD Ultimately Duke had  total yards whereas the Tigers had  yards PERIOD In the second half Clemson had five consecutive drives end with a blocked field goal two fumbles within the sevenyard line an interception and a turnover on downs PERIOD Meanwhile Duke scored three touchdowns in the second half PERIOD

The Tigers were disappointed after giving the ball away three times against Duke PERIOD But following their dominant win over the Owls last weekend the locker room attitude has shifted PERIOD

A ton of confidence PERIOD A ton of confidence in our guys in what were doing and their ability to produce and create plays Riley said PERIOD I really feel like they are going to be in a great position moving forward and I think they are a hungry and confident group PERIOD I really do. last weeks game against FAU was the first that Clemsons offense didnt turn the ball over to the opposing team PERIOD Riley understands the concept of learning from your mistakes and sees these mishaps as building blocks for future success PERIOD

Weve had a couple of critical errors in that Duke game that obviously sets you back but these guys confidence isnt broken at all he said PERIOD You just gotta learn from those critical mistakes thats the whole deal. as the team continues to improve Clemson will look to continue its sevenyear win streak against the Seminoles on Saturday and Riley is more than enthusiastic about the challenge PERIOD
