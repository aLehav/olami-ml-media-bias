Senior midfielder Brittany Stanko makes a move around a South Carolina defender PERIOD The Wolfpack lost the exhibition game  to  USC on Augsut fourteenth in Dail Soccer Stadium PERIOD

Fresh off a valuable if disappointing twogame trip to San Diego for the Torero Classic the NC State womens soccer team faces Elon in the home opener tonight PERIOD

The Wolfpack  narrowly dropped both its West Coast contests  and  in overtime to San Diego  and No PERIOD  Pepperdine  respectively last weekend PERIOD

Tonights  p.m PERIOD clash is the thirteenth between the two nonconference foes PERIOD So far NC State has maintained an undefeated  record against the Phoenix  with the teams last meeting back in  PERIOD The Pack won that match handily  but tonights match will be the first under head coach Tim Santoro PERIOD

While in San Diego Santoro got a good look at a team seeking to escape from the bottom of the ACC ladder PERIOD Climbing those rungs will take time especially as the Pack is a startlingly young squad this season PERIOD

Three of the Wolfpacks top five minutes leaders so far are freshmen and freshman goalkeeper Sydney Wootten put on one of the best performances of any Pack player making seven saves across  scoreless minutes Sunday against Pepperdine PERIOD

Will Santoro continue his faith in his young shotstopper If not he could opt for the greater experience offered by redshirt junior Mackenzie Stelljes PERIOD

Notably all of the Wolfpacks six new freshmen debuted during the weekend with many of them like center back Ella Bonner midfielder Taylor Porter and forward Maxine Blackwood starting from the opening whistle PERIOD

Another positive for the Pack is the return of redshirt sophomore midfielder Jackie Stengel who missed last season due to an ACL injury PERIOD

Stengel scored just minutes after coming onto the field last Friday against San Diego and her pedigree skill and tenacity as an attacking midfielder should boost States chances of getting out of the depths of the ACC and into conference relevancy PERIOD

But before ACC play can even be considered State has to take care of business against nonconference foes and get its first win on the board PERIOD To do that the team has to demonstrate that it has learned the principles Santoro and the coaching staff have drilled relentlessly over the offseason sharp ball movement crisp and coordinated attacking patterns and organized disciplined defending when the opponent has the ball PERIOD

The Packs opponents the Phoenix should test the teams progress but should not pose a huge threat PERIOD Elon returns seven starters from last seasons group that went  and the team was picked to finish eighth out of the  teams that make up the Colonial Athletic Association PERIOD

However that hardly means the Pack should come in with its guard down as Elon is fresh off an overtime victory against Davidson PERIOD It isnt a stretch to say the Phoenix will come in confident and looking to get a first victory against NC State PERIOD

To limit Elon NC State must keep a close eye on sophomore forward Grace Bennett PERIOD Bennett was an AllACC Freshmen Team member last season and led the Phoenix in goals PERIOD

The Wolfpack is after its three hundred and twenty-second victory in program history and its first win this season PERIOD
