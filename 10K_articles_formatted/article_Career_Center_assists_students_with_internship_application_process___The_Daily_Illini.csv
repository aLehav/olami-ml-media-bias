Its that time of year again

The time when students begin to drift off in anticipation of upcoming breaks the time when students start to cram for finals and the time when students frantically apply for lastminute internship possibilities for the upcoming summer PERIOD

It may seem early to start planning for the summer  after all it is more than six months away  but the best internships go quickly and students know if they wait too long they will not get the internship they want PERIOD

This process can be intimidating but luckily the Career Center  S PERIOD Wright St. can help by offering guidance to students who need it PERIOD

Sejin Oh senior in LAS and employee of the Career Center said the free resources available at the Career Center were useful and got her started on the path to getting the internship she wanted PERIOD



Oh had two internships one on campus and one in South Korea where she worked for a company called Credit Swiss PERIOD She worked as an analyst completing various tasks and assignments to help her summertime associates PERIOD

It opened up so many opportunities that I had never thought about before Oh said PERIOD I dont have any formal academic background in finance but after this internship I feel like I can go into that field PERIOD It was really an amazing learning experience. damian Lay assistant director of marketing and communications and event coordinator at the Career Center said internships allow students to see what their intended profession really entails and it does not always work out for the best PERIOD

An internship is a great way for students to see what their futures could look like Lay said PERIOD We see many success stories where students absolutely enjoyed their internship experience but there are also many students who come back realizing that their dream job is not at all what they had expected. lay said either of these outcomes can be seen as learning experiences because now the student knows ahead of time what they are getting into and can make changes to assure they get the job of their dreams PERIOD

For that reason Lay and Oh agree it is never too early to get started in the process PERIOD

I was a freshman when I started to develop my resume Oh said PERIOD Now I critique other peoples resumes run workshops and more. mike Buehlman graduate student and career consultant said the Web site for the Career Center www.careercenter.uiuc.edu provides a lot of information including a time line to help students PERIOD

We have a time line on our Web site that helps students prioritize Buehlman said PERIOD Its never too late to start but its never too early PERIOD Thats why at the Career Center we say the sooner you start the better. lay said the Web site also offers a link to an online job listing called IConnect www.iconnectuiuc.com PERIOD

On the Web site youll see a list of companies that recruit on campus Lay said PERIOD They will post their internship openings online and you can apply directly through uploading your resume. buehlman said the IConnect system specifically targets students whose college does not have a career office of their own yet it extends beyond LAS opportunities PERIOD

Opportunities are pretty much across the board Buehlman said PERIOD Any opportunity you can think of PERIOD And most employers assume that you dont have any previous experience. both Buehlman and Lay agree the most important part of a resume is that students have shown the initiative to get involved on campus PERIOD

Companies are going to want to see that you have applied yourself beyond just going to class and getting a good GPA Buehlman said PERIOD Any internship is going to be looking for that especially PERIOD If you have experience on campus it is just as good as having a pervious job or internship. lay said it does not matter whether students have parttime work experience or volunteering experience only that students have some experience outside the classroom PERIOD

Oh did not even have experience in the field she was interning in yet she still feels it helped her more than anything else she has ever done PERIOD

I feel like I learned twice as much and twice as fast than during my entire four years the University Oh said PERIOD It was really an amazing experience because I was able to network with many people who I wouldnt even be in contact with if I didnt have that internship. oh said another resource she values at the Career Center is the mock interview program because without it her actual interview would have been more intimidating PERIOD She said the mock interview allowed her to correct mistakes she was unaware she was making PERIOD

Buehlman said the mock interview program consists of a pretend interview which is then taped and critiqued allowing students to get feedback on their interview style PERIOD It is an hour long the first halfhour is the interview and the second  minutes is the critique PERIOD

Lay requires students to treat the mock interview as a real interview because it is the only way to gain actual experience PERIOD

Many students go into an interview room and that will be the first time they ever get interviewed Lay said PERIOD It is always helpful when you have some experience and you know what to expect PERIOD The mock interview is very successful at giving students a glimpse of what they can expect when they walk into that interview room. lay also said that after this mock interview students can get the DVD of their interview to take home with them to review further PERIOD

Oh said if she could go back and do things differently she would have more internships because the more experience students have the better off they will be PERIOD

Oh plans on returning to Korea after graduating a semester early to look for a job PERIOD

I have been in the United States for about seven years Oh said PERIOD Im really looking forward to going back to Korea and getting a job there.",Career Center assists students with internship application process - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
