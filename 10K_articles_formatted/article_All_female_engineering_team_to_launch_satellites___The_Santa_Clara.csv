1818,2000-01-19,"the launch of three satellites created by an allfemale engineering team at Santa Clara University was postponed two minutes before liftoff last Friday due to the launch devices low battery power PERIOD The satellites are tentatively scheduled to head in to space next Thursday PERIOD 
The satellites were completed last year after nearly  hours of work by a team of six Santa Clara engineering students PERIOD
Had the launch been a success it would have been the first of the century PERIOD
Composed of only female students the group has received even more attention since the engineering field is dominated by males PERIOD
 Amy Slaughterbeck said PERIOD 
Fellow Artemis engineer Theresa Kuhlman explained the impact their work has had PERIOD
 Kuhlman said PERIOD 
The project has had a positive impact on Kuhlmans life as well PERIOD
 Kuhlman said PERIOD 
Launched aboard a large rocket the satellites will be released into outer space this Saturday assuming all goes according to plan PERIOD The launching will take place at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc Cal PERIOD
Once released the satellites will orbit nearly  miles above the earths surface PERIOD To put that figure in perspective the distance between Santa Clara and Eugene Ore PERIOD is roughly  miles PERIOD The Santa Clara satellites will ride into space on Stanfords larger satellite and will also be accompanied by satellites from Arizona State University Weber State University and the U.S PERIOD Air Force Academy PERIOD
Slaughterbeck described the smaller satellite as approximately the size of a wallet with the other two satellites twice that size PERIOD
The larger Santa Clara satellites will collect storm information PERIOD One will send out a signal in Morse code indicating the projects Web site PERIOD
 Slaughterbeck said PERIOD Citing difficulties in obtaining and working with some of the materials used during the project Slaughterbeck added that 
The student engineers responsible for the creation of the satellites are Maureen Breiling Dina Hadi Corina Hu Theresa Kuhlman Amy Slaughterbeck and Adelia Valdez PERIOD They were directed by Christopher Kitts codirector of the Santa Clara Remote Extreme Environment Mechanisms Laboratory SCREEM a division of the universitys engineering department PERIOD
The group named their development project  for the Greek goddess of hunting and the moon PERIOD
