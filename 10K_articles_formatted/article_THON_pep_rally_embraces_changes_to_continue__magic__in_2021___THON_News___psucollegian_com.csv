The Nittany Lion engages with the crowd during the THON  Pep Rally Saturday Feb PERIOD   at the Bryce Jordan Center PERIOD

The annual THON pep rally will be held at  p.m PERIOD Saturday in partnership with the Penn State Alumni Association but the events typical White Out will look a bit different PERIOD

The THON pep rally typically consists of performances from many Penn State varsity athletic teams but the teams cant make appearances in the BJC this year due to attendance restrictions PERIOD

According to the Alumni Association CEO Paul Clifford the partnership between the organization and THON pep rally began three years ago when a former THON alumni relations chair pitched an idea to bring magic to the event PERIOD

She had the vision of bringing the magic of a Beaver Stadium White Out to the Bryce Jordan Center during THON and we were all about that Clifford said PERIOD We thought it was a great way to advance the Alumni Associations brand through kind of the marquee sponsorship of that but also to help a great cause and be a part of what is often one of the signature moments of THON. the logistics of a virtual White Out were no small task for event organizers Clifford said but the association and pep rally team worked to distribute white shirts out to dancers and THON captains to make the event look as normal as possible PERIOD

With so many planning changes for this years event pep rally coordinators Patrick Bradley and Rachel Hansen said theyre appreciative of the connection theyve been able to utilize with the alumni association PERIOD

Obviously its not a typical year Bradley juniormechanical engineering said PERIOD Pep rally really changed its vision and we kept communicating that with the Alumni Association throughout the way and they were super supportive with every change we made. hansen seniorbiochemistry and molecular biology said the pep rally especially changed since athletic teams couldnt perform in the BJC PERIOD She added that some teams have recorded shout outs or performances but theres a new aspect thats very exciting. something thats different this year and was really cool to see is that some of the teams had the opportunity to do their videos from where they practice Hansen said PERIOD

For example the mens and womens swimming and diving teams appearances during the pep rally will stream right from the pool according to Hansen PERIOD

Aside from being unable to participate inperson athletic teams had another unique restriction because more teams than usual are playing out their seasons during the spring according to Bradley PERIOD

A lot of these teams really impressed us and were just so proud of what theyve done Bradley said PERIOD We really had to work around a lot of Covid guidelines but in the end its going to be something really special. bradley also said some of the changes are something that will be implemented in future THON weekends even with the return of inperson events PERIOD This can allow teams to have a role in the pep rally even if they cant make it PERIOD

Hansen said the message behind THON hasnt changed even in a year marred with adversity and the Alumni Associations involvement shows that PERIOD

I think it shows how much of a community Penn State is in the fact that the Alumni Association wants to be a part of an event thats so uncertain and so new Hansen said PERIOD They really put their trust in us and are showing how much they value THON. additionally Clifford said he wants the Alumni Associations involvement to show THON doesnt end when one graduates PERIOD

Its such a big part of the Penn State experience that it doesnt end when people leave the institution  and it cant end Clifford said PERIOD THON and the fight against childhood cancer cant end until cancer is defeated. clifford said hes excited for the outcome of the work leading up to the pep rally PERIOD

I have no doubt that its going to be both different and yet moving and one of the more memorable experiences of the virtual  THON. mORE THON COVERAGE
