Nebraska first baseman Scott Schreiber was not affected by the two hour and three minute rain delay in Nebraskas  victory against Loyola Marymount on Saturday PERIOD

Both teams were in an offensive lull until the sixth inning until Schreiber gave the Huskers the lead PERIOD

With centerfielder Ryan Boldt on first base and one out third baseman Jake Placzek hit a double to advance Boldt to third base putting two runners in scoring position for designated hitter Ben Miller PERIOD

Miller was 2for3 at the time of his at bat and LMU starting pitcher Cory Abbott elected to intentionally walk him creating a force at any base PERIOD

Schreiber was hitless at time of his at bat and Abbott was playing to the statistical advantages of the situation PERIOD

Going into the at bat he said he was trying to stick to his approach of letting the ball travel so he could hit it to the opposite field PERIOD

Schreiber fought of a jammed pitch to hit a blooper of single over LMU second baseman Phil Caulfield scoring Boldt and Placzek PERIOD

NU starting pitcher Matt Waldron cruised through six innings and did not run into trouble until the top of the seventh PERIOD

Loyola Marymount designated hitter Niko Decolati who went 4for4 led off the inning for the Lions with a single to left field PERIOD Right fielder Sean Watkins proceeded to hit a single creating runners at first and second PERIOD

Waldron then got third baseman Ted Boeke to roll into a double play PERIOD

When you pitch down in the zone you got a good chance to let the defense do its thing Nebraska coach Darin Erstad said PERIOD It creates opportunities to roll things up and those are situations you need to execute and take advantage of PERIOD

Waldron was relieved by pitcher Jeff Chesnut after the double play PERIOD Chestnut struck out infielder Seaver Whalen to help the Huskers go unscathed PERIOD LMU has seven left seven runners on base PERIOD

Waldron was given an ovation when he came of the field as he pitched . innings allowing six hits one walk and no runs PERIOD

It definitely helps but I cant get too comfortable Waldron said about his performance against LMU PERIOD I got to do that every week and if I get too comfortable then I take some things lightly and theres no room for it at this level. schreiber kept the offensive line moving with a twoout double in the bottom of the eighth inning PERIOD

That at bat at the end was a fantastic at bat to grind out the double and keep that inning alive Erstad said PERIOD

NU right fielder Jake Meyers followed Schreibers at bat with an RBI triple to expand Nebraskas lead

Nebraska pitcher Chad Luensmann came in relief of Chestnut in the top of the ninth inning to earn his first save of the year PERIOD Luensmann retired catcher Cassidy Brown and first baseman Jamey Smart routinely before running into some trouble PERIOD

Decolati hit a first pitch single up the middle to give the Lions some life PERIOD Right fielder Sean Watkins followed by a sharply hit ball to NU shortstop Steven Reveles that was ruled a hit PERIOD

With runners on first and second Luensmann got third baseman Ted Boeke to hit into a fielders choice to end the game PERIOD

Waldron earned his second win of the season and Luensmann was credited with the save PERIOD

First pitch for NUs game on Sunday is at  p.m. and will attempt to earn the fourgame sweep PERIOD
