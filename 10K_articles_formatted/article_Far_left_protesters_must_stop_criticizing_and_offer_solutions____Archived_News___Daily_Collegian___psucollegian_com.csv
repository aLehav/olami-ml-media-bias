Im sick of watching Hollywood stars gather around ignorant people on their antiwar crusade with pointless banter PERIOD I suppose what some people would call Alist stars  such as Sean Penn Susan Sarandon Tim Robbins and Jane Fonda  did  Im not one of those people PERIOD What they did a couple of weeks ago is not even worthy of being called protest PERIOD

Simply put the entire gathering was nothing more than an emotionfilled antiBush joke PERIOD Their protest didnt even attract any real stars and by real stars I mean elected political officials PERIOD If this gathering was supposed to represent the general feeling of all Americans why didnt elected politicians grace the event with their presence Not all of the elected officials opposed to the war in Iraq could have been busy  so where were they

This actually has a quite simple answer PERIOD The elected officials know that antiwar gatherings such as this have no political clout PERIOD The  walked around in bomb costumes with signs reading such ridiculous statements as  Im sure some of you share that sentiment PERIOD As far as I am concerned the farleft extremists who participated in this event have absolutely no care for truth PERIOD

Jane Fonda a much criticized antiwar lunatic stated during this event that the United States caused the deaths of three million Vietnamese and Cambodians following our exit from the Vietnam War PERIOD Thats right after the United States left Vietnam we caused those deaths  after we left I dare wonder why no elected officials would appear at this cesspool of ignorance PERIOD

When asked questions pertaining to Iraq Tim Robbins a terrific actor told an OReilly Factor producer that he should  The response was a typical farleft liberal response with absolutely no intent on actually answering an intellectual question PERIOD One would assume those attending an antiwar gathering would at least have the knowledge to answer questions pertaining to the war PERIOD Unfortunately simple logic does not apply to those on the farleft PERIOD

Do these people honestly want the United States to fail in Iraq I think they do PERIOD It is truly unimaginable to me that Americans would actually want America to fail PERIOD The Constitution protects their right to spew hatred for America as does it protect my right to call them on their absurdities PERIOD

Like most Americans I certainly recognize the fact the war in Iraq has become an absolute mess PERIOD The problem will not be solved with pointless rhetoric PERIOD I wish I could say Congress was doing something to help the situation but they arent PERIOD Instead of offering intelligent wellthought out plans for helping to fix the war in Iraq our elected officials have instead decided to engage in passing  Honestly what does that mean The phrase  says it all PERIOD Wouldnt it be more constructive to offer alternatives to President Bushs plan than trying to send him a message of disagreement If you ask me President Bush is perfectly aware his plans for Iraq are meeting opposition he doesnt need a nonbinding resolution to tell him PERIOD

Speaking of the  plan how is it that we in our infinite political wisdom know the plan wont work Military leaders have been advising the addition of more troops for quite some time PERIOD Just last week James Baker cochair of the Iraq Study Group suggested the possibility of giving Bushs plan a  The Democrats praised the report for its offering PERIOD Now a major contributor to that report is suggesting allowing the plan to work PERIOD However because of blatantly partisan politics and antiBush sentiment these statements have fallen on deaf ears PERIOD

Its now time for our newlyelected Congress to stop sitting on their hands except for the occasional time they take to twiddle their thumbs and propose ways in which to make the terrible situation in Iraq better PERIOD Most of us are aware that the war in Iraq is a mistake PERIOD It no longer needs to be said but it does need to be fixed PERIOD In November the American people apparently 

Pointless protests and  resolutions do not stop the escalating violence in Iraq PERIOD I believe in this country and our ability to solve problems we have caused PERIOD We must stabilize Iraq as failure is simply not an option PERIOD To quote Rob Reiners  film The American President  Its time to get serious PERIOD
