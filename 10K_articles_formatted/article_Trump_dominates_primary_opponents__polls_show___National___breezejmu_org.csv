The Center Square  Former President Donald Trump holds a sizable lead over an array of Republican primary challengers PERIOD

A New York TimesSiena College poll released Monday shows that Trump has held on to his lead with  support from Republicans PERIOD In a distant second place is Florida Gov PERIOD Ron DeSantis who has  support followed by several candidates around  PERIOD

According to the new poll former Vice President Mike Pence Sen PERIOD Tim Scott RS.C. and former ambassador and South Carolina Gov PERIOD Nikki Haley all have  support PERIOD

Former New Jersey Gov PERIOD Chris Christie and author and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy both have  support PERIOD Polls have varied significantly in how well lowerpolling candidates are faring PERIOD Recent polls have showed either Ramaswamy or Pence polling higher PERIOD

Regardless one trend is clear across polls A major lead for Trump PERIOD

That poll comes after a CBS news poll released over the weekend shows  of Americans disapprove of the job President Joe Biden is doing as president PERIOD

Trump had a lead over DeSantis last year but saw his numbers shoot up after federal agents raided his MaraLago estate for classified documents kicking off a string of legal problems for the former president PERIOD

Trumps poll numbers though have seemingly been propelled by the targeting which the former president calls a coordinated corrupt attempt to keep him from winning the White House PERIOD

Hillary Clinton deleted  Emails many of them Classified after getting a Subpoena from Congress Trump posted Sunday on TruthSocial his social media site of choice PERIOD Nothing happened to her  stupid James Comey then head of the FBI stated that no reasonable prosecutor would prosecute this PERIOD Then why is Deranged Jack Smith prosecuting me when I did nothing wrong as per the PRA The answer is Election Interference  They are using the Department of Injustice in an attempt to Rig  Steal the Presidential Election on  PERIOD This is Prosecutorial Misconduct
