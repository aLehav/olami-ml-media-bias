Aidan Thomas  Monday November  

The Irish wide receiving corps continues to be plagued by the injury bug as fifthyear receiver Avery Davis suffered a torn ACL on Saturday ending his season head coach Brian Kelly told the media on Saturday PERIOD The Irish have already lost senior receiver Joe Wilkins to injury as well as fellow senior Lawrence Keys to the transfer portal this season PERIOD

Avery Davis cemented himself as the clear WR  in this offense with  receiving yards and four touchdowns on  receptions PERIOD Only senior receiver Kevin Austin and sophomore tight end Michael Mayer had more receiving yards through nine games PERIOD With Davis out the void must be filled by senior Braden Lenzy and freshman Lorenzo Styles stepping up in increased roles PERIOD The duo has  and  yards respectively PERIOD After that the depth becomes a serious question mark PERIOD Freshman wide receiver Deion Colzie has three receptions and backup senior tight end George Takacs has notched one PERIOD They are the only other nonrunning backs to have recorded catches on the season PERIOD Likely running backs Kyren Williams Chris Tyree and Logan Diggs will see increased roles in the passing game to supplement the lost production PERIOD

Avery Davis is eligible for a sixth year with Notre Dame and Kelly noted the veteran receiver is more than welcome back with the Fighting Irish PERIOD Davis will likely make that decision in the offseason PERIOD Meanwhile Notre Dame sits at  and continues their pursuit for a major bowl game  or an outside shot at a College Football Playoff berth  without one of their top offensive weapons PERIOD
