Colby Colleges weekly studentrun editorially independent newspaper

On Monday Oct PERIOD  the second segment of a three part series of studentled discussions on the History of AntiBlackness at Colby College took place in Ostrove Auditorium in Diamond PERIOD The event was also streamed on Facebook Live by the Colby Mutual Aid Fund PERIOD

The series centers around instances of antiBlackness on campus institutional failures in responding to these racist incidents and student resistance against antiBlackness PERIOD The discussion on Oct PERIOD  specifically dealt with the Akon Day incident that occured in the fall of  PERIOD

The event sponsored by the Department of Womens Gender and Sexuality Studies was led by Terri Nwanma  Faith NkansahSiriboe  and Micaela Duran  PERIOD Both NkansahSiriboe and Duran work in Special Collections at Colby from which most of the information for the series was compiled PERIOD

The three students shared that the History of AntiBlackness at Colby College series received substantial pushback from the College PERIOD However that did not deter the  students who registered to attend the Akon Day discussion PERIOD

They viewed the purpose of the series as a reckoning of the history of antiBlackness at Colby examining the way the administration has responded to incidents of antiBlackness and reflecting on how Colbys campus has failed and continues to fail to adequately support marginalized students PERIOD

Nwanma added that they felt a responsibility to document the stories of people not having a good time on campus and people who are affected by racism all around the world. the Oct PERIOD  presentation began by describing the buildup to the Akon Day incident PERIOD That fall Four Winds the Colleges indigeneous students club created a poster detailing advice on how to avoid offensive Halloween costumes PERIOD

Their poster included Four signs your Halloween costume is disrespectful which included wearing accessories that resemble another cultures sacred artifacts or any offensive symbols PERIOD However controversy arose after an SGA email that reiterated Four Winds overall message did so with much milder language PERIOD

The Akon Day incident itself occurred on Nov PERIOD   PERIOD The event had been an annual tradition and the  event marked the seventh anniversary of it PERIOD

The party was thrown by the mens lacrosse team and was predominantly attended by white students PERIOD Partygoers dressed in orange jumpsuits and wore fake teardrop tattoos using rapper Akons Konvicted album as inspiration PERIOD Female students braided their hair to mimic cornrows and wore hoop earrings PERIOD

These costumes were racist students appropriated Black culture through their hair and accessories and correlated Blackness with criminality by dressing in jumpsuits imitating prison garb PERIOD When these white students were told to change by their peers they refused PERIOD

After the event there was little to no disciplinary action or sanctions applied to the organizers and participants of the Akon Day party PERIOD This led to student outrage and an eventual sitin in Cotter Union on Nov PERIOD   PERIOD Hundreds of students and staff dressed in black and sat in silence for an hour PERIOD A group of Black students dressed in orange jumpsuits to mimic the students at the party PERIOD

To accompany their own telling the story of Akon Day the three presenters screened an interview done with an attendee of the sitin Adji Astou Seck  PERIOD

The turnout was amazing Astou Seck recounted PERIOD Seeing my professors there and seeing people I didnt think cared showed to me that as a whole our community still stands together. the aftermath of the event also led Duran and other students to start a new group called Students  Change which among many other asyet unrealized demands called for President David Greene to host a town hall for students to address the incident PERIOD This was frustrating for many students as President Greene never agreed to lead the town hall PERIOD

Duran also outlined in the presentation a list of demands the group had for the College that she has yet to see be fulfilled by the College even now two years later PERIOD

Some of the demands included not only making Civil Discourse accessible to students but the archives of past years posts as well PERIOD Students also called on Colby to make a one to five year plan to improve counseling services for students of color hire more staff for the Pugh Center and to create a five to ten year plan to create a department dedicated to addressing bias on campus PERIOD

The students also called for the college to relook at their threshold for bias in the student handbook and the role of the Bias Incidence Prevention and Response BIPR team PERIOD

NkansahSiriboe shared that she believed it was important to keep the story of Akon Day alive PERIOD

As students filter out through Colby some stories get erased PERIOD On the same note when incidents are not addressed outright it gets erased NkansahSiriboe explained PERIOD For students of color at Colby they should know that their feelings are validated and they are unfortunately not new. the presenters took many questions from the audience PERIOD

The first installment of the series took place on Oct PERIOD  and featured the story of Mayra Diaz a Puerto Rican Black student at Colby who was falsely accused by a white student for threatening her life PERIOD The last part of the series took place on Nov PERIOD  and was focused on an incident of police brutality that happened at the College in the Students Organized for Black and Latnix Unity SOBLU meeting room in  PERIOD

The incident took place on April   PERIOD Following a Rave to the Grave Party in Page Commons an intoxicated student wandered into the SOBLU room in the Pugh Center where he fell asleep PERIOD A security officer passing by came to check on the student with two students who identified the sleeping student PERIOD A third student by the name of Ramirez also came into the room questioning what the security officer was doing there PERIOD

At this point tensions between the student body and Security had been high PERIOD Ramirez was then slammed onto the ground and put in a butterfly hold PERIOD The situation escalated and Waterville Fairfield Winslow and Oakland Police Departments were called along with Maine State Troopers and personnel from the Kennebec Valley Sheriffs office PERIOD

Another POC student Roundtree also had a confrontation with law enforcement in the same Pugh Center incident PERIOD In what could clearly be categorized as excessive force Roundtree was maced three times while handcuffed PERIOD

Law enforcement also stopped another student Talarico by Johnson Pond for unclear reasons PERIOD After a scuffle the three all students of color were arrested and taken to the police station in Augusta for criminal trespassing and assault PERIOD Ramirez Roundtree and Talarico received no medical attention for the injuries they sustained from law enforcement PERIOD

One of the critical pieces of evidence from that night was video footage taken on a cellphone showing Ramirez pinned on the ground in his own blood PERIOD The footage was widely circulated among the Colby community and which prompted outrage PERIOD A protest was held on April  which was attended by over  students which was nearly half of Colbys student

population at the time PERIOD

As with the aftermath of the Akon Day party that would occur nine years later many of the demands by the students which included the suspension of the security officers involved a public apology and financial support for the affected students were never realized PERIOD

The series shed light on the failures of the administration when it comes to supporting BIPOC students at Colby and how justice still has not been served for affected students PERIOD

Students looking to better understand these events can check out the special collections archives for the documents and sources used in the presentations PERIOD
