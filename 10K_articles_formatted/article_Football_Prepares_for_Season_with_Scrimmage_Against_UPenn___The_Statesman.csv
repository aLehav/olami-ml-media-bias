Remember Me



The Stony Brook football team looked sharp in all areas of their game during a scrimmage against the University of Pennsylvania on Saturday afternoon at LaValle Stadium PERIOD The day featured controlled situational drills in the first half followed by a second half of 11on11 live football PERIOD

Overall today I think we stayed healthy coach Chuck Priore said PERIOD No major injuries and we had some good performances by some kids. the Seawolves outscored the Quakers  in the second half PERIOD The Stony Brook offense was able to connect on two long plays that both resulted in touchdowns PERIOD

The first of those plays was a 45yard touchdown run by running back Jamie Williams PERIOD The sophomore found an opening on the left side of the field and was able to take it all the way for the score PERIOD The run capped off a Seawolves drive which started all the way back at their own four yard line PERIOD

Later on in the half Seawolves senior quarterback Lyle Negron was able to find junior Will Tye for a 54yard connection which resulted in a touchdown to put the Seawolves up  PERIOD Negron was strong throughout the scrimmage and finished the day  of  throwing for  yards PERIOD

Our quarterback was able to throw the ball Priore said PERIOD I think he had a great day PERIOD Hes a good thrower and I think thats somebody that we need to do. the defense also played well for Stony Brook PERIOD They finished with five sacks in the contest including three by senior Dimetrius Bernard PERIOD

Coach Priore was pleased with the pressure his defensive line was able to get on the Penn quarterbacks PERIOD We rushed the passer well with our front line and we tackled well he said PERIOD

The first half of the day had both teams playing out various ingame scenarios  PERIOD This included 7on7s short yardage situations goal line drills kicking and returning drills and two minute drills PERIOD

During one of the Seawolves possessions during the two minute drill there was a pair of busted calls forcing the offense to take two consecutive timeouts PERIOD But Priore said having this happen in a scrimmage allows it to be a learning experience PERIOD

Things like that when they happen in a game you lose a game Priore said PERIOD But when they happen in a scrimmage you can coach it up and fix it. saturdays scrimmage also had some special meaning for coach Priore because he got the chance to coach against his brother PERIOD Ray Priore serves as the defensive coordinator for Penn the school from which Chuck Priore was an offensive coordinator and strength coach at from  to  PERIOD

We were on the same staff so we went against each other all the time during spring ball head coach Priore said PERIOD Theyre well coached PERIOD It was good and it was fun. now Stony Brook will continue to prepare for the start of their regular season schedule PERIOD The Seawolves will be on the road for their first three games beginning with a matchup against Rhode Island next Saturday at  p.m PERIOD

When asked if his team will be prepared for next Saturday coach Priore answered We have no choice. joe Galotti is a journalism student at Stony Brook University in his senior year PERIOD He started writing for The Statesman back in the Fall of  and is now beginning his first year as the papers Sports Editor PERIOD After graduation he hopes to one day be a beat writer in charge of covering a professional sports team PERIOD
