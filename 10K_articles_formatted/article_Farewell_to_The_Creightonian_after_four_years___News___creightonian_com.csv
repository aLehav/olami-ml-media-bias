A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 39F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD

Updated November     pm



This is the last story that I will ever write for The Creightonian a reality that has not quite sunk in yet even as I type these words PERIOD

I owe so much to this little student newspaper and to all of the people that Ive worked with to produce it every week PERIOD I forged many friendships in the newsroom I made many memories while covering my beats and many opportunities presented themselves as a result of my work for the paper PERIOD Now after four years and  issues it is time for me to say goodbye PERIOD

When I arrived on campus as a wideeyed freshman I wondered if I would ever find my place at Creighton and in the world as a whole PERIOD I did not come in with a big group of close friends PERIOD Greek life was not my cup of tea or maybe it was since I dont drink tea PERIOD I took a stroll down the mall during the activities fair but none of the clubs or organizations jumped out to me PERIOD I signed up for a handful of listserves because my adviser didnt give me any other choice but I had no intention of joining any of them PERIOD

The Creightonian was among my chosen clubs and it did pique my interest but venturing outside my comfort zone was not something freshmanme was prepared to do PERIOD Seniorme struggles with that as well PERIOD

At some point during the second semester of my senior year of high school I decided to study journalism with a focus on sports but I set foot on campus with no journalistic experience whatsoever PERIOD As a complete novice joining a newspaper right away was an intimidating prospect for me and I decided to pass on the first Creightonian meeting PERIOD However when the first issue came out I picked up a copy and read it from front to back PERIOD I noticed some mistakes in the copy something I have a knack for ask my grade schools secretary and I realized there was a role for me that I would be comfortable with  copy editing PERIOD I spoke with Kris Boyle my adviser who also happened to serve as adviser of The Creightonian and showed up the next week to help with the second issue PERIOD A few weeks later I wrote my first story PERIOD

Over the past four years Ive done pretty much every job possible for the newspaper short of taking over as editor in chief though I did consider checking that off the list as well PERIOD I covered the volleyball and mens basketball beats as a reporter PERIOD I spent three semesters as assistant sports editor and one as sports editor PERIOD I copy edited stories all four years and spent three semesters as head copy editor PERIOD I helped with layout I made graphics I wrote stories for the front page and I even took a couple of photos PERIOD

I worked with six editors in chief two faculty advisers three sports editors and three head copy editors in addition to all the other editors assistants and writers that make up The Creightonian staff PERIOD Ive met some incredible people from a sports editor and columnist with a unique voice to a dedicated writer who survived three seasons in charge to an outspoken copy editor who always says what is on her mind and so many more PERIOD I am lucky to call all of them my friends PERIOD

I shared many late nights in the newsroom with those people battling server issues and page layout limitations to put out a product that we could be proud of PERIOD I chose to stick around until the end of almost every production night even when I didnt have to because of the comedy and camaraderie that filled the room every week PERIOD I just wanted to be there PERIOD

The people are what truly kept me coming back every semester but writing for The Creightonian provided some pretty awesome perks as well PERIOD

I was handed the mens basketball beat from day one a dream come true for me as a Bluejay fan born and raised in Omaha PERIOD I never imagined before coming to campus that I would ever make the 18hour drive to Philadelphia or take a flight to San Antonio to cover NCAA Tournament games but I did so thanks to the Creighton Department of Journalism Media and Computing and The Creightonian PERIOD I chronicled the programs transition from the Missouri Valley to the Big East and was on press row to witness history as Doug McDermott eclipsed  career points PERIOD Ive made connections and received opportunities as a result of my work for the paper including freelance work for Hail Varsity Magazine and radio spots for  the Zone PERIOD

I learned as much or more about being a journalist while working for The Creightonian as I did in the classroom and I certainly wouldnt be where I am today if I had never worked up the courage to show up to that second meeting PERIOD I strongly encourage every journalism major who comes through Creighton to spend at least one semester working for The Creightonian PERIOD No matter where your interest may lie whether it be newswriting opinion sports graphics cartoons photography or design there is a role on The Creightonian for you PERIOD Joining the paper was without a doubt the best decision I made during my time in college PERIOD Oh and did I mention theres sometimes pizza on production nights

Finally I want to thank anyone who has ever read one of my stories PERIOD My writing has come a long way from that first story and I tried my best to be informative insightful and entertaining with everything I wrote PERIOD

I could easily ramble on for several hundred more words brevity has never been a strength of mine as evidenced by everything Ive ever written for this newspaper but Ill spare you and cut this off here PERIOD

Its been a blast Creighton PERIOD Thanks for everything PERIOD
