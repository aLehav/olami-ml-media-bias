Both sides can learn from each other

DANIEL MUNKSGAARD

MUNKSGAARD is a sophomore English and philosophy major and a Daily Nebraskan columnist PERIOD

Back around the beginning of my freshman year I ran into a friendly acquaintance I knew from high school PERIOD Glad to see a face I knew after being swarmed by  I didnt know I asked how she was doing and where she was living PERIOD

She gave me an odd look then said 

Now the fact that she was in a sorority didnt surprise me PERIOD But what did surprise me was how quickly she assumed Id think less of her for it PERIOD

Ill admit that I dont have a great track record as far as respecting the greek system goes PERIOD Ive put in my share of jokes at the expense of drunken greeks and my own experience with a few of the fraternities on campus has been shall we say less than positive PERIOD Im referring specifically to the fraternity members who beat the living daylights out of me a little more than two years ago because I  But that was an isolated incident and most of my criticisms of greeks centered around the fact that they just seemed odd to me PERIOD Innocent enough PERIOD

On the other hand I was living in the honors dorm at the time PERIOD Whos easier to look down on hoards of young women clapping and singing in unison for bizarre induction rituals or dozens of computer geeks screaming at each other while playing video games that are hooked up to speakers so large the floor literally shakes

Weve all got social habits that can easily be looked down upon by others PERIOD

In the end I figured greeks and geeks only have a oneletter difference so where was the tension coming from

The tension it turns out is coming from on one side a rather vocal segment of the student population that has had a bone to pick with the greek system for a long time PERIOD And on the other we have a greek system loyal to its ideals and willing to defend itself PERIOD

Some of the grievances are philosophical but a lot of them have turned personal PERIOD Its easy for the folks in the pseudo intellectual crowd a group I fully confess to being part of to target the greeks as an example of mindless conformity PERIOD And they do raise several legitimate issues ranging from such minor but annoying matters as the incredibly tacky sight of house after house covered in toilet paper to the much more serious issues involving the homophobic sexist and even rapeencouraging attitudes displayed by certain and I emphasize certain fraternities PERIOD

But instead of approaching these problems by working together with and respecting the members of our fraternity and sorority groups most critics have degenerated to inflammatory namecalling and even crying for an end to the greek system PERIOD

This last part in particular is selfdefeating PERIOD First of all every one of the problems attributed to greek houses specifically binge drinking and sexual assault occur all over campus PERIOD If were going to eliminate problems by cutting off the organization factor we may as well shut the university down PERIOD

Second fraternities and sororities are far too active in the university to shut them down  not without raising some serious issues PERIOD

And before someone suggests that booting them out of the student government would be a good thing let me say that I understand the frustration expressed by people who notice that the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska representatives are almost entirely greek despite the fact that greeks are a minority on campus PERIOD

But guess what folks Thats because they vote PERIOD If the nongreek majority of the student body doesnt take part in the elections its their own fault PERIOD The voter turnout at ASUN elections the last few years is nothing short of pathetic PERIOD I dont like it anymore than you do but if the greeks are the only ones who care enough to take part then theyve earned the right to run the student government PERIOD

Again Ive never had a particular fondness for fraternities PERIOD I really doubt theres one I would fit in to and that kind of thing just doesnt appeal to me PERIOD

But thats me PERIOD

Just because I have no reason to go for that doesnt mean someone else shouldnt PERIOD I can really understand why people would want to have a place where they can be immediately surrounded by friendly faces and a definite social structure as opposed to striking out into a faceless and largely unsympathetic student body PERIOD Religious organizations know this which is why you cant swing a dead cat without hitting some salvation preacher during the first week of classes PERIOD

And its that unsympathetic student body that probably has the most to answer for PERIOD I know its hard to expect unity with such a large number of students but I know of universities even larger than ours that have better attitudes PERIOD

Before we start attacking the one group on campus that seems to have some sense of unity lets try and offer up a viable alternative PERIOD They may have their flaws but we could probably stand to learn something from them PERIOD
