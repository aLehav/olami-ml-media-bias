4112,2014-11-25,"on November   a young woman named Brittany Maynard died in the comfort of her home surrounded by loved ones PERIOD Earlier that year Maynard learned that she had an aggressive form of brain cancer that left her with only six months to live PERIOD

The cancer never got a chance to claim Brittanys life PERIOD Maynard induced her own death taking a prescription she received from a doctor which allowed her to pass away on her own terms PERIOD

Maynards desire to avoid the degenerative effects of her disease and die peacefully reignited Americas debate on physicianassisted suicide PERIOD Her story captivated the nation finding its way into major news broadcasts and forcing Americans to confront an uncomfortable topic PERIOD

Physicianassisted suicide or aid in dying is currently legal in only Oregon Washington and Vermont PERIOD Court decisions in New Mexico and Montana have also set precedents that allow for the practice PERIOD Outside of these five states terminally ill individuals do not have the option to safely end their own life PERIOD

Resistance to death with dignity laws often stems from the United States controversial history with the practice PERIOD The right to die movement first gained national attention in the 90s when Dr PERIOD Jacob Jack Kevorkian became known in the media as Doctor Death. between  and  Kevorkian assisted in the deaths of over  consenting patients PERIOD The doctor lost his medical license in  and eventually served time in prison for his illegal possession and administration of lethal injections PERIOD

Physicians and psychiatrists criticize Jack Kevorkian as reckless and unprofessional PERIOD Many of the doctors clients were not physically suffering or psychologically sound PERIOD Kevorkian often moved quickly administering injections after a brief consultation on the day he met a client PERIOD

Kevorkians irresponsible actions served as a detriment to the movement he supported PERIOD The negative media attention impacted public perception causing widespread rejection of the practice PERIOD A generation of adults now equates the right to die movement with Kevorkians dangerous methods PERIOD

The actual state of death with dignity laws starkly contrasts this perception PERIOD The Oregon law that allowed Brittany Maynards peaceful passing offers a clear example PERIOD

Oregon.gov makes the states Death with Dignity Act accessible in its entirety PERIOD The law sets out a stringent set of guidelines for patients hoping to access the service PERIOD

First the patient must receive a diagnosis that leaves them with six or less months to live PERIOD After reviewing other options the physician who administers the diagnosis must agree that the patient is a suitable candidate PERIOD If the doctor has any doubt that the person suffers from mental illness the law requires them to refer the individual to a counselor for psychiatric analysis PERIOD

If they pass through these stages the patient must then seek out a second physician to repeat the process PERIOD If the second doctor agrees with the previous diagnosis and assessment the patient becomes eligible for the prescription PERIOD They must wait  days and apply for the prescription again before they can actually receive it PERIOD

The Oregon law takes great lengths to avoid incorrect diagnoses rushed decisions or aid in dying for those who arent suffering physically PERIOD The act has carefully allowed more than  suffering patients to decide their terms of death while directing inappropriate candidates to psychiatric care PERIOD

Stringent guidelines can assure that death with dignity laws do not resemble the reckless practice of Jack Kevorkian PERIOD This may put some dissenters at ease but other opponents cite religious or moral reasons to reject physicianassisted suicide PERIOD

The Catholic Church condemned the practice almost immediately after Brittany Maynards death PERIOD In a statement to the Italian news agency ANSA the Vaticans top ethicist called assisted suicide an absurdity. the Vaticans official position states that suicide violates divine law and interferes with the work of God PERIOD Many religions take similar positions stating that humans do not have a role in determining their terms of existence PERIOD

Despite these protests recent ideological trends suggest that Americans no longer support religious intervention in social policy PERIOD A Gallup poll published in May indicates that the number of Americans who consider themselves socially conservative trends downward over the last ten years PERIOD

Gallup reports that gay marriage which also faces opposition by religions now receives support from  of Americans PERIOD More significantly  of  to  yearolds support the practice PERIOD

As this younger generation raises their own children social attitudes will likely continue their shift away from religious conservatism PERIOD In an interview with PBS Newshour Dr PERIOD Arthur Caplan suggests that this secular attitude will influence future debate over aid in dying PERIOD

Caplan who serves as head of medical ethics at NYU says we may see the same folks who got tied up in trying to broaden marriage laws and trying to see homosexuality gain wider acceptance move to say this is a choice I want too. religious Americans have every right to reject physicianassisted suicide on a personal level PERIOD But young citizens are less and less likely to think that religious beliefs should influence public policy PERIOD A suffering patient who makes the personal decision to seek aid in dying should not be denied relief by another persons antiquated belief system PERIOD

With moral and procedural concerns addressed widespread legalization of physicianassisted suicide appears logically sound PERIOD In publicizing her story Brittany Maynard hoped to start this difficult national process PERIOD

Shortly before her death Maynard published a letter with CNN PERIOD I hope for the sake of my fellow American citizens  that this option is available to you she wrote PERIOD If you ever find yourself walking a mile in my shoes I hope that you would at least be given the same choice and that no one tries to take it from you. maynard leaves the public with a call to action and the start of an uncomfortable conversation PERIOD We all have a duty to continue the dialogue PERIOD

Matthew Meyer encourages you to research the story of Maynard and others like her PERIOD
