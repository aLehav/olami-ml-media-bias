After an entire year of being hampered by nagging injuries the Gophers womens cross country team is finally healthy  just in time for their biggest meet of the season PERIOD
On Saturday the Gophers will run at the District IV Cross Country Championships in Champaign Ill. in what could be their last competition of the year unless they place high enough to go to the NCAAs PERIOD
Weve got to be no less than fourth to have an outside chance of going to nationals Coach Gary Wilson said PERIOD We havent all ran on all cylinders at the same time this season PERIOD If we can all hit on the same day we can do that. the Gophers were upset after taking fifth as a team at the Big Ten Championships two weeks ago PERIOD Minnesota was aiming for a fourthplace finish but was once again troubled by physical ailments PERIOD
Sophomore Anna Gullingsrud the Big Ten Cross Country Athlete of the Month in September suffered from bronchitis during the race and finished a disappointing twenty-eighth overall and third on the team PERIOD Gullingsrud has been Minnesotas top runner all season PERIOD
It was really disappointing because I know what I can do Gullingsrud said PERIOD I just happened to be sick that day PERIOD Ill just have to get it done on Saturday PERIOD Were all pretty up about this thing. one runner who starred for the Gophers at Big Tens was junior Kari Thompson PERIOD She led the team with a fourteenth overall finish in  minutes  seconds on the 5000meter course which got her secondteam AllBig Ten honors PERIOD Freshman Minna Haronoja took twenty-first overall and second on the team for Minnesota PERIOD
The Gophers will run their top seven harriers this weekend in Illinois down from the nine they ran at Big Tens PERIOD Besides Gullingsrud Thompson and Haronoja sophomores Amy Hoel and Julie Golla junior Andrea Lentz and senior Karen Kleindl will also compete this weekend PERIOD
Even though the Gophers suffered through a tough race two weeks ago Wilson said they have kept their composure and are ready for regionals PERIOD
Minnesota will go to Champaign seeded eighth out of over  schools PERIOD There will be more than  runners crowding the golf course making it imperative that the Gophers start strong if they have aspirations of going to the NCAA Cross Country Championships on Nov PERIOD  in Tucson Ariz PERIOD
The top two teams in each of the eight regions automatically advance to nationals as do the top three runners who are not on one of the top two teams PERIOD After that the NCAA gives atlarge bids to the final six teams in the nation rounding out the  team field PERIOD
It will take Minnesotas best performance of the season for the team to make it to nationals but that is a possibility given the teams talent and potential PERIOD
Nobody is going south mentally Wilson said PERIOD We have to regroup and go back after it at regionals PERIOD Were not out of it by any means PERIOD We just have to take care of business. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
