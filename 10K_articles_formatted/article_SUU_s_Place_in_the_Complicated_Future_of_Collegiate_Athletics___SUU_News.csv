Student Media  Southern Utah University

For the first time in  years Eric Houle has some spring free time PERIOD As track and field coach at Southern Utah University for three and a half decades March until May has always been chockfull of workouts travel and meets PERIOD

Not this year PERIOD You already know why PERIOD

Houle is taking his Coronavirus enforced free time on walks with his family and has enjoyed the time to be around his loved ones PERIOD Still he fears that once things go back to normal it wont quite feel normal PERIOD

An athlete after this all over will never be the same again Houle told SUU News PERIOD They lose development through the season and pushing themselves to reach new personal records but its better to stay alive than to set a new record. coaches across the country are making similar realizations PERIOD SUUs staff has kept the disruption in perspective PERIOD Almost no one wants play or practice to resume but the future hangs over each team like a dark storm cloud PERIOD

Collegiate athletics are cyclical in nature PERIOD Competitors are only allotted four seasons of athletic eligibility which means the best programs are the ones who are constantly looking ahead PERIOD Recruiting is an essential part of a coachs duty and one bad recruiting class can severely hamper the program years down the line PERIOD

Houle knows the ins and outs of recruiting athletes to SUU better than anyone because of his experience PERIOD Hes mastered the art of phone calls and emails to attract high school athletes but will miss a critical part of his recruiting strategy because of Covid19 PERIOD

Official visits are one time invitations for a recruit and their parents to personally walk on campus and get to know their coaches PERIOD The NCAA suspended all recruiting until at least April  but if the Coronavirus continues to shut down the country it will keep recruits from visiting their schools in person PERIOD

Now youre trying to convince someone to choose a place without ever being able to see it Houle said PERIOD Its tough. for SUU mens basketball coach Todd Simon only a few scholarships open up for new recruits to fill each season PERIOD Each recruit is invaluable and mens basketball programs at every level of the NCAA may not have the same access to prospects as they usually have PERIOD

Youre going to see a lot of poor fits during this recruiting cycle Simon said PERIOD In general terms when you cant look a recruit in the eye see them in person see their body language or see how they fit into the culture of the team you dont as good a read on the person and the fit. recruiting hasnt been the primary resource for acquiring talent during Simons time at SUU PERIOD The TBirds have benefited from studentathletes at other DivisionI institutions electing to transfer from their first school and play for SUU like Dwayne Morgan Cameron Oluyitan and a slew of others have since Simon arrived PERIOD

The only penalty for transferring is that mens basketball players must sit out the season after they transfer PERIOD Many have suggested that a onetime waiver should exist so that studentathletes can transfer without sitting out a season PERIOD Other sports like volleyball have already adopted the rule and if the rule were to be instituted players could seemingly at will PERIOD

Mix that together with the mounds of bad fits from this Coronavirusaddled recruiting cycle and college basketball will be looking chaotic over the next few years PERIOD

The exception has not passed yet but Simon theorized that its only a matter of time until its in practice PERIOD

Roster construction has already been further complicated by the growth of graduate transfers PERIOD Studentathletes who finish their Bachelors Degrees can transfer without penalty to universities who offer a masters program their initial school doesnt house PERIOD

According to NCAA.org the amount of graduate transfers had doubled by  only five years after the waiver was initially instated in  PERIOD In  . percent of all players were graduate transfers the greatest portion of grad transfers of any DivisionI sport PERIOD Studentathletes who complete their schooling at midmajor universities are making the jump to bigger schools all over the country PERIOD

I think college basketball as we know it is going to look very different a year from now Simon concluded PERIOD

While Houle Simon and the rest of SUUs coaches continue to do their due diligence by assessing recruits through film study and phone calls developing studentathletes who are already on campus presents another unique challenge PERIOD

Teams are not allowed to meet or practice at this time and while strength and conditioning coach Marcus Romero continues to send the studentathletes training recommendations the TBirds with eligibility left are missing out on a crucial time where they could get into the gym to work on their skills PERIOD

This challenge is especially difficult for SUU gymnastics coach Scott Bauman PERIOD The tail end of the spring is a time that Bauman sets apart for his squad to work on new skills and techniques PERIOD

His team lost its chance to compete at the conference championship but also the time where last seasons underclassmen would learn what they needed to contribute next season PERIOD

Theyre going to have three months off and these athletes have never had three months off in their entire lives Bauman said PERIOD They just dont take that much time off because it takes too long to come back. after spending  hours a week in the gym just getting back up to speed will prove difficult PERIOD Trying to incorporate new skills into their routines is a different beast altogether PERIOD

Perhaps the only solace for coaches during this time of uncertainty is the fact that every other coach in the country is dealing with these same challenges PERIOD No one knows what the fall is going to look like PERIOD No one knows if football season will be played or how its absence will affect revenue streams for athletic departments across the country PERIOD

Bauman focuses on what he and his studentathletes can learn from this disruption PERIOD

Not everything in life goes the way you plan it Bauman said PERIOD There are lessons to be learned from this and I tried to explain to my team that sometimes these things happen and theres nothing you can do PERIOD You have to make the most of it and make the best of it. with so much uncertainty ahead there is no choice but to press on PERIOD
