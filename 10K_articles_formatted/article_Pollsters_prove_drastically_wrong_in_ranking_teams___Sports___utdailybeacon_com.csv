Last week a Beacon colleague of mine and former Sports Editor Jim

Masilak wrote a commentary concerning the inequity of the preseason

polls PERIOD

Being a product of a liberal education I have decided to apply the

scientific method I learned in my natural sciences classes to this theory

and see if I could duplicate his findings PERIOD

Before I begin allow me to thank the faculty of the geology department who

had the vision and determination to make the scientific method a real part

of my life PERIOD Luckily for my experimentation I will not employ a mineral kit

or topographical maps but my couch television and remote control PERIOD

Last week Jim dissected the travesty that was Texas preseason ranking of

No PERIOD  PERIOD After their disastrous defeat at the hands of NC State in Austin

it became obvious that they were not a top25 team and that the pollsters

had failed again PERIOD Keep this example in mind as I move forward in my

experimentation PERIOD

Jim also examined the Arizona Wildcats preseason No PERIOD  ranking PERIOD The

Wildcats traveled to Penn State to battle the No PERIOD  Nittany Lions PERIOD Football

logic dictated that this would be a close game but once again the polls

were tragically wrong as Arizona learned at the hands of the Nittany

Lions PERIOD

Arizona dropped to No PERIOD  and became the focus of my study this weekend PERIOD As

any good scientist will attest only by using the same set of data can my

testing of Jims hypothesis hope to be valid PERIOD

This week the Wildcats traveled to Fort Worth Texas to play the TCU

Horned Frogs PERIOD Two years ago TCU went  but are now in the midst of

rebuilding PERIOD They proved to the Wildcats that the construction is moving

along ahead of schedule PERIOD

The Horned Frogs came out hot and took a  lead into halftime PERIOD The

Wildcats did explode for  points in the third but once again fell behind

after TCU hit two field goals PERIOD In the end Arizona had to score a touchdown

with less than three minutes remaining in the game to edge out the slim

victory PERIOD

Despite the win it appeared to me that Jims theory was correct and that

the preseason polls have about as much right being published as Kevin

ONeills Tennessee memoirs PERIOD

I was happy with my finding but just like my mineral identification quiz

I sought perfection and carried on with the exhausting work PERIOD

My next example came in the Colorado StateColorado matchup PERIOD The CU

Buffaloes entered the game ranked No PERIOD  but were massacred by the CSU

Rams  PERIOD The game was never even close since the Buffaloes scored all

their points in the fourth quarter PERIOD

Once again the inequity stared me right in the face and dared me to

flinch PERIOD

Despite all this evidence the worst anecdote came in the form of the new

ESPNUSA Today rankings PERIOD After Texas beat a weak Stanford  and

NC State shut out South Carolina  the Longhorns are actually ranked

ahead of the Wolfpack PERIOD And people in Tennessee complain about respect PERIOD

To me this is a total lack of elementary school logic by the pollsters and

the worst example yet of inequity PERIOD

But what does all this experimentation and analysis mean to you the

Tennessee football fan Dont worry about what the polls say now As I have

proven and Jim before me the polls are about as accurate as Dan

Dierdorfs commentary and just like Dierdorf should not be taken

seriously PERIOD

As the Vols proved last season the team that goes undefeated will be

crowned the national champs PERIOD There is only one poll that really matters and

it doesnt come out until January PERIOD
