A year ago Alicia Neal had only one Facebook account now she has two which she regulates constantly through her email PERIOD



Neal the director of bands at Eastern created her second Facebook page a year ago during her position as assistant director of bands and assistant

director of athletic bands at the University of Minnesota after repeated attempts by her students to add her as a friend PERIOD

She would tell her students at the beginning of each semester that she does not friend students and then decided it would be beneficial to have a profile that was open to everyone PERIOD

One I keep open I dont block it from anyone Neal said PERIOD

This is the only form of social media Neal will add current past or future students to PERIOD

She even uses this profile as a recruiting tool for potential students who want to talk about Easterns music program she said PERIOD

The increasing swing to online communication makes Facebook a good way for potential students to meet professors or  in Neals case  the director of a band they may want to join PERIOD

Neal who keeps track of what students post on her page said she does not want things posted that could reflect badly on her nor does she want to post things that would be questionable which is why she separated the two into different pages PERIOD

I know students will sometimes post things that Ill hear that are questionable and Ill talk to the students Neal said PERIOD

Some things that are considered questionable would be discussions about colleagues inappropriate topics like sex or drugs and provocative statements PERIOD

She said she has never had a problem with students posting questionable items on her page PERIOD

Her professional Facebook page is linked to her email and she said she checks everything that is posted PERIOD

She said students tend to post questionable material when they think their peers will be the only ones who see it PERIOD

But with the increasing use of social media professionals and students have to take more precautions because employers look at social media sites to see what potential employees have done PERIOD

Kali an Eastern student said she started regulating her social sites as soon as she made them PERIOD

Ive never put anything like I dont use curse words ever since Ive gotten it Kali said PERIOD

When a picture gets posted or she is tagged in a photo where she can potentially look bad she untags herself and asks the person to remove the picture PERIOD

For example Kali was tagged in a photo put up by her roommate showing Kali with alcohol in the background and she said she asked to be removed from Facebook PERIOD

She didnt realize you could see the background because it was at a friends house so she took that picture down Kali said PERIOD

Kali said people should moderate what is put up or said on a Facebook profile PERIOD

With the knowledge that employers and family members look at social sites Kali said she tries to keep her social media pages as clean as possible PERIOD

My mom is on there and she doesnt want to see me doing anything bad Kali said PERIOD I think it just looks trashy if you have a bunch of incriminating photos. horror stories of people being fired or passed over for jobs are something that Kali thinks about when she looks at her pages PERIOD

She said she knows employers look at her social sites and if what they can see if incriminating she will not get the job she wants PERIOD

While laws sometimes stop employers from requiring social media passwords no laws that stop employers from checking social media sites she saidand she does not want any issues to arise PERIOD

Ive heard stories of a bridesmaid at a wedding she had a wine glass in her hand and she got fired because of that Kali said PERIOD You are representing your company. linda Moore the director of Career Services said Facebook is not the way students should be communicating with employers PERIOD

It is like the wild wild west on Facebook Moore said PERIOD

If students want to communicate with employers they should be on sites like LinkedIn and other platforms that are made for that type of communication she said PERIOD

Because employers do some types of filtering through Facebook Moore said students should regulate what they post but should also just simply make sure their privacy settings are set so only friends can view the page PERIOD

Students also have to be careful of what they post PERIOD

Neal said this is why she has two Facebook accounts for the two sides of her life and regulates the content of her pages PERIOD

All it takes is for someone to copy share like or tag a photo for it to be visible by more than personal friends PERIOD

Once you put something on the Internet it is always out there and people can find it Neal said PERIOD
