Oklahoma State University Ag Research is sharing research information and seeds related to the B5 cotton gene with other research facilities so a blightresistant cotton variety can be created PERIOD

Oklahoma State University Ag Research looks for answers to find a cotton variety resistant to bacterial blight PERIOD

In the 1950s the B5 cotton gene for bacterial blight resistance was discovered in Egypt PERIOD Fast forward to the 1970s Lloyd Brinkerhoff former OSU professor of plant pathology began to study the effects of placing the gene into the blightsusceptible upland cotton variety Acala  PERIOD

Former OSU Regents professor in the OSU Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Margaret Essenberg advanced Brinkerhoffs research PERIOD One of Essenbergs students Kenneth McNally currently a scientist in genomics at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines worked to isolate and characterize the gene PERIOD Another member of Essenbergs research team Melanie Bayles went on to make hybrids to study how the B5 gene is inherited PERIOD

The results were puzzling PERIOD

If B5 were a wellbehaved single resistance gene onefourth would have no resistance gene and be blightsusceptible Bayles said PERIOD That was not what I saw PERIOD I saw only a tiny number of susceptible plants PERIOD Thats when we knew we had to look for an explanation for what caused this. rather unusual the B5 gene did not behave like a single resistance gene because it seemingly occurred in two different locations in the cottons genome PERIOD

I wanted to understand how the resistance of the gene works PERIOD One of the ways in which the resistance genes work is by triggering the synthesis of natural defense chemicals at infection sites Essenberg said PERIOD AcB5 cotton is a champion in this activity PERIOD My colleague Margaret Pierce showed that it accumulated at least tenfold more defense chemicals than cotton lines with four other single resistance genes. professor of plant pathology and microbiology at Texas AM AgriLife Research Terry A PERIOD Wheeler found that under laboratory conditions AcB5 the cotton plant that contains the B5 gene is highly resistant to race  the strain of bacterial blight that has taken over the Cotton Belt in recent years PERIOD Ten other pathogen races that were tested were also resisted by AcB5 cotton PERIOD

The current research findings suggest that there is potential for creating a cotton variety that is resistant to bacterial blight PERIOD The moment is now for Essenberg Bayles and now the data management specialist for the OSU Wheat Improvement Team to share their finding and seeds with the scientific world PERIOD

In agriculture reliance upon a single gene for disease resistance is dangerous because pathogens tend to evolve to overcome such resistance Essenberg said PERIOD We would like to see the B5 gene be combined with one or more other strong broadly specific genes such as B12 to develop strong and stable resistance to bacterial blight. as of lately OSU is seeking to form contractsagreements with other institutions to continue research into a new race 18resistant cotton variety in the near future PERIOD
