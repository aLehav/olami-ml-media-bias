Rep PERIOD David Valadao and Rep PERIOD Jim Costa a Fresno State alumnus met with students and Fresno State President Dr PERIOD Joseph Castro last week in separate meetings PERIOD They spoke with students who have gotten temporary relief from deportation through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program PERIOD The outcome of that program is being debated by Congress after President Donald Trump ordered it to be rescinded last fall PERIOD

Dream Success Center coordinator Gaby Encinas and Vice President of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management Dr PERIOD Frank Lamas also met with the representatives PERIOD

The congressmen wanted to hear from Fresno States students Encinas said PERIOD To learn about their stories and life experiences and most importantly how their lives have been affected by DACA and the impact of not having a legislative solution to DACA. trump is proposing a pathway to citizenship for . million young immigrants who were brought to the U.S PERIOD illegally as children while demanding that Democrats support  billion for border security including his proposed border wall and strict new limits on legal immigration PERIOD

The .8million figure would go well beyond the nearly  immigrants currently covered by the Obama administrations DACA program expanding the protections primarily to cover people who were eligible for DACA but did not apply PERIOD

The White House designed that element of the plan in hopes that it would provide a strong enticement for Democrats PERIOD But it quickly generated opposition from some Republican conservatives PERIOD

The president staged an impromptu 15minute news conference last week at which he said he had just written something out that included a path to citizenship for Dreamers that would take  to  years PERIOD

A total  students were present at the Fresno State meetings hosted by the U.S PERIOD representatives last week representing the roughly  DACA students enrolled at Fresno State PERIOD

Encinas said that although there are ongoing discussions on a solution for DACA the congressmens primary goal was to listen to what the students had to say PERIOD

These meetings were important because it is our responsibility to amplify the voices of our DACA students when many of them feel fearful to come forward Encinas said PERIOD

Valadao who has more than  DACA recipients in his district discussed the vital role they play as active workers and students to society PERIOD He added that DACA recipients give far more than they take. with the deadline approaching it is more important than ever that Congress comes together to codify the DACA program and allow these young people to continue to live in the United States  the only home they know Valadao stated in a news release after the meeting PERIOD

Costa whose meeting was after Valadaos also heard the stories of the undocumented students as they shared their experience of coming to the U.S PERIOD and growing up in the country PERIOD

Living with this uncertainty  its not right its unfair and its outrageous Costa told the students PERIOD My grandparents immigrated to this country and faced many of the same challenges you do PERIOD My story your story the American story is the story of immigrants. genoveva Vivar a senior doublemajoring in accounting and Spanish shared her story with Costa PERIOD

She said she usually does not share her story as a DACA student but did so after realizing the impact it could make for others PERIOD

Knowing that if by me sharing my story and my experiences I can make a difference then I will do so Vivar said PERIOD I shouldnt fear sharing my story because I am not a criminal so I should rather empower my experiences and struggles. in a statement to The Collegian Castro stressed the important role DACA students play as leaders when they graduate from Fresno State PERIOD

Its important that our elected officials understand the contributions of our Dreamers the important role they play in our communities and the uncertainty they and their families face on a daily basis Castro said PERIOD

Encinas who works handson with DACA students at Fresno State said continuing discussions over immigration with students as well as lawmakers is important for finding a solution PERIOD
