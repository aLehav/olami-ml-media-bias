Despite all of the emphasis put on the seniors through celebratory days and gestures from the team members of the senior class stressed that this season has never really been about them PERIOD

Summing it up I think our senior class has always been more about the team than it has been about the seniors senior midfielder Jenni Loveless said PERIOD The season has been about the team and never about the seniors because if it was about us the team wouldnt be where it is right now. loveless also mentioned it matters more what role everyone on the team plays and not what year they are or how long theyve been a member of the Mountaineers PERIOD

Senior forward Jenn Bass stressed the importance of individual roles on the team PERIOD She emphasized that by playing as a unit and not by class has allowed the team to work out their kinks from years prior and create a strong program PERIOD

The senior class for the Mountaineers as a whole stressed that playing for their team has brought them so much farther than playing for a senior legacy PERIOD

Weve definitely implemented the idea of playing for each other and coming together and knowing that were playing for something so much bigger than ourselves senior defender Merlin Beckwith said PERIOD Its been a great season because weve overcome adversity PERIOD Weve gone up and down but weve pushed through it and were always ready for the next game. throughout the season the senior class has put in impressive amounts of minutes goals and shutouts during their last season PERIOD

Senior goalkeeper Meg Roberson has played  minutes out of the  minute total in the season and boasted an overall save percentage of . in goal PERIOD She also pitched four shutouts PERIOD

The entire senior class has played in all  games this season and with three goals apiece senior forward Sam Childress and Beckwith tied for the lead in goal count for seniors PERIOD Beckwith also led the senior class in assists with a total of four PERIOD

Even with so much success on the field the senior class stresses its some of the offthefield comradery with the team that theyll miss the most PERIOD

The singing the bus rides those are memories you look back on PERIOD Its going to different places and having new experiences with a team you love Beckwith said PERIOD

Seniors Carrie Taylor and Abbey Nolte also mentioned how much theyll miss the bus rides that didnt always make it to their destination and the practices with the team PERIOD

We make everyone feel really comfortable which hasnt always been a thing in the past PERIOD Thats something that our class has really wanted to set in because we want everyone to feel comfortable with the team and that if youre a freshman you can feel comfortable talking to a senior Nolte said PERIOD I think thats something the other classes have really gotten from us and it will continue to apply even when we leave. with a legacy of unity comfort and success to leave behind for the rest of their teammates the seniors prepare to take on their last tournament games starting Nov PERIOD  in Atlanta Georgia before ending their programchanging undergraduate soccer careers at Appalachian State University PERIOD
