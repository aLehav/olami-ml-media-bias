The insatiable being

the cyclical force that oversees my every move PERIOD

You who waits for the prospect to strike PERIOD

The behemoth lurking in the shadow

why do you torment me so



No force can free me from the chains

you graciously placed upon my shoulders PERIOD

A fate sealed the instant your

quietus gaze beheld

the neonate you PERIOD



The pure vessel instantly tainted

as per the human condition

forced to play the game which I call life PERIOD

This game has no winner PERIOD

Theres no winning here



for you have stacked the game against me PERIOD

Yet though I know this

something unfathomable propels me forward

makes me believe the game winnable

but not here



never here PERIOD

My relentless foe

you who scoffs in wait

enjoying my futile struggle PERIOD

For you are the dictator of this game



and I am but a game piece

one stricken to the board of life

waiting for the certainty of being cleared

waiting for you to empty it

and with it my legacy PERIOD



But what happens then

Am I to travel the void aimlessly

or to play the game once again

Wont you tell me my foe

For my torment arent I owed
