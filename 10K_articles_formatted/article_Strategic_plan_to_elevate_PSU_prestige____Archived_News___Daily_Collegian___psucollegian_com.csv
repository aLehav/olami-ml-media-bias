Strategic plan to elevate PSU prestige

Editors Note This is the first of an occasional series looking at how strategic planning will affect the University PERIOD

Jim Hatch strides through the second floor of Carpenter Building giving instructions to workers who are knocking down walls and building new ones PERIOD  he says to painters who are converting the former offices into an anthropology museum PERIOD

Hatch director of the 15yearold Anthropology Museum that up to last week was housed in the dank subbasement of Sparks Building is supervising the move of more than  artifacts to a slightly larger and much more accessible building PERIOD

The museum move as well as other improvements in the anthropology department including more laboratories and more faculty is mostly the result of the Universitys threeyear effort at strategic planning PERIOD The concept is finally in written form derived from plans from all sectors of the University and now being circulated in a draft PERIOD

The plan deals primarily with University Park although a systemwide plan will be completed soon PERIOD And although many of the details have already been announced such as the creation of a biotechnology institute and the school of communications there are some developments that will have a significant impact on the University PERIOD

Chief among those changes most administrators say is the decision to target  academic departments and give them extra money and materials to achieve national prominence PERIOD

Hatchs anthropology department is one of the chosen this year but senior administrators insist that the list doesnt mean that other departments wont be chosen in the future PERIOD This year acoustics astronomy atmospheric sciences biotechnologhy chemistry earth systems sciences French marketing for business materials sciences philosophy psychology and public policy will receive special resources to attract national attention PERIOD

The chairman of the history department which isnt on the list said Some departments already have a national reputation PERIOD Were building on our strengths in this department PERIOD Were working to get back in shapeAs long as they dont cut us back then we might be unhappy PERIOD But the history department is beginning to make certain changes PERIOD We lost out a bit in the 1970s by losing faculty and weve taken our licks to this point but were going to rebuild. if youre interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor click here PERIOD
