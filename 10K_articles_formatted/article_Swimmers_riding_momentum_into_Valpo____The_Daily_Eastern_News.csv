The Eastern mens and womens swim teams second to last meet of the season will be of great importance PERIOD



The Panthers men are coming off a  victory against Millikin and the Eastern women will look to ride the momentum from their  victory PERIOD

I didnt really see the difference in their time Yanney said PERIOD Where I saw more of a difference was in the effort the team is giving. eastern was able to take full advantage of Millikins youth and lack of depth by experimenting with its swimmers in different positions and distances PERIOD However going into the meet against Valparaiso the Panthers wont have the same luxury PERIOD

According to Yanney Valpo breastroker Mike Hermes and Sean Conrin will be the swimmers that will create a challenge strategically PERIOD

On the womens side Yanney anticipates distance swimmer Britt Nelson in the  meter and  meter and butterfly swimmer Katie Urbas to cause problems for the womens team PERIOD

We swam against Valpo earlier in the year and traditionally they are a secondhalf team and I anticipate they are going to be more prepared Yanney said PERIOD It is definitely not going be like the Millikin meet PERIOD Everyone is going to be swimming in their strong events this week. easterns meet against the Crusaders takes on increased importance because it hopes to have the momentum factor with the Midwest Classic in Indianapolis less then a month away PERIOD

This is definitely important for us to perform well in this upcoming meet and the meet against St PERIOD Louis Yanney said PERIOD

The results of the Eastern mens and womens trip to Millikin was definitely a momentum builder for the teams PERIOD
