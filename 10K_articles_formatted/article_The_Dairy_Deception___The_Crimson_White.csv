Now lets continue this train of thought with the fact the human species is the only known organism to consume milk postinfancy PERIOD And furthermore humans are the only creatures that consume milk from another mammal PERIOD By no means am I denouncing the consumption of milk Im just trying to provoke a little bit of thought PERIOD

So after considering this information why have we continued to consume milk

The original purpose of milk is to grow an infant into a toddler during the fastest growth spurt of a persons life PERIOD Have you ever thought that in a time when everyone is watching their waistline that maybe we should watch our intake of the food that grew a 8pound baby into a 24pound toddler in a year We are talking a  percent weight gain PERIOD

According to a February  Mayo Clinic report lactose intolerance is caused by the lack of an enzyme called lactase that is necessary when breaking down lactose molecules into glucose and galactose PERIOD

In simpler terms this enzyme is produced at large during infancy to accommodate for the expected intake of breast milk PERIOD As we grow older our production of this enzyme lactase decreases forcing dairy products to move throughout the body unprocessed and possibly causing lactose intolerance PERIOD

We are all familiar with the Got milk campaign and the benefits of milk such as calcium vitamin A and vitamin D PERIOD Shockingly enough milk is not even one of our best sources of calcium PERIOD

Turnip greens and seeds such as sunflower actually contain more calcium by weight than milk PERIOD A 100gram serving of milk contains  milligrams of calcium while a 100gram serving of almonds contains  milligrams PERIOD Maybe it is time we begin to question natures most nearly perfect food. the scariest part about all this is that rBGH a synthetic bovine growth hormone has been proven to increase the levels of the growth hormone IGF1 PERIOD At elevated levels this growth hormone has been proven to increase cancer rates PERIOD

Many countries such as New Zealand Canada and Australia have actually banned rBGH for its known cancer risks so why hasnt the U.S. when there has been absolutely no scientific evidence proving milk as an aid in weight loss and studies show that bone strength has more to do with physical activity in childhood than milk consumption why do we believe this lie that we have been told for our entire lives

After realizing that the production of milk is unnatural its health benefits do not actually exist and that there are better and easier ways to consume the nutrients minutely found in milk maybe its time for us to find an alternative PERIOD
