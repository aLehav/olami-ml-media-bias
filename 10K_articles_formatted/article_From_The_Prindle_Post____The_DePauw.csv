7096,2023-11-04,"your birthday a pets name or the nostalgia of a high school sports number the composition of our iPhone passwords can seem so simple PERIOD But a recent case levied by the FBI against Apple has led to a conflict over the integrity of these passwords and has sparked debate concerning privacy and security PERIOD A California court ordered Apple to produce a feature that would circumvent software that is inhibiting the FBI from accessing the phone of Syed Farook who along with his wife allegedly committed the San Bernardino terrorist attacks PERIOD

Apple is challenging the ruling claiming it sets a dangerous precedent for consumer security PERIOD Tim Cook said about the case some things are hard and some things are right PERIOD And some things are both PERIOD This is one of those things. the conflict between Apple and the FBI seems dichotomous with Apple standing up for privacy rights and the FBI trying to bolster its investigative powers PERIOD Moral dilemmas begin to arise after analyzing how the case has played out within the legal system PERIOD These dilemmas concern U.S PERIOD governance structures and the process by which novel legal developments emerge PERIOD

By looking at the institutional atmosphere we can see a lack of constitutive dialogue within elective governance structures concerning this important issue PERIOD The FBIs case rests on the All Writs Act of  dating back  years before Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone PERIOD This demonstrates the vacancy of relevant legal sources in any way related to the technological developments and cyber security pressures of the twenty-first century PERIOD This is primarily due to the absolute dearth of legislation coming out of Congress concerning these issues PERIOD A lack of cyber security expertise and the absence of political will has left the intersection of privacy and security without congressional leadership PERIOD

Some members of Congress have proposed a Commission of Cyber Security and Privacy while others have suggested that the Apple vs PERIOD FBI case be put into legislative hands PERIOD More opinionated members of Congress are calling for legislation that would force companies like Apple to unlock the phones of criminals PERIOD Beyond these limited efforts there is a lack of genuine dialogue in the legislative chambers of the Federal government concerning issues of privacy and security PERIOD This stifles mechanisms by which constituents understand their respective representatives positions on these issues PERIOD There is an obvious need for more robust dialogue and investigation into these issues especially as the public and the federal government try to cope with a rising fear of terrorism in a postSnowden world PERIOD

Tim Cook suggests that this ruling would trample on civil liberties while FBI Chief Hon PERIOD James Comey admits that the larger question should not be settled in the courts and that this extends into who we want to be as a country and how we want to govern ourselves. this reveals the need for legislative processes at the federal level PERIOD Leaving this matter completely to the courts to decide is to steer the debate away from stewardship of elective institutions PERIOD This issue is representative of the personal and national values we wish to carry into the technological future PERIOD Stagnation in Congress is limiting the ability of US government structures to develop policy based on constructive debate and constituent input PERIOD
