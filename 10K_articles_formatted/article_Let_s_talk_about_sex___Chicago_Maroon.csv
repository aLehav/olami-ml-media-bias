2179,2022-03-16,"as reported in todays Maroon article After Roe UCMC gives choice this past Tuesday marked the fortieth anniversary of the Roe v PERIOD Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion PERIOD As the article reports the University of Chicago Medical Center UCMC has made dramatic steps forward in making abortions as well as contraceptive and reproductive health resources easily available to students PERIOD The UCMC has also been a strong proponent of research and education efforts in the field especially with the recently launched Center for Interdisciplinary Inquiry and Innovation in Sexual and Reproductive Health Ci3 designed to address problems in reproductive health with a focus on assisting women on the South Side PERIOD However despite such laudable medical resources safe sex practices and reproductive health are rarely the subject of student discussion PERIOD The University would do well to better publicize these extensive sexual and reproductive health resources on behalf of the UCMC as well as promote more discussion of such topics in campus culture PERIOD

Though students must attend a safe sex discussion during their Orientation Week there is often little followup to the short presentation PERIOD Presentations to housing from Resources for Sexual Violence Prevention RSVP are available upon request from Resident Heads but these efforts are limited to students living in housing PERIOD Rather than relegating reproductive health education to Orientation Week there should be ongoing efforts to make the topic commonplace PERIOD With such initiatives as Tea Time and Sex Chats students have demonstrated an interest in establishing a constant dialogue about sex and reproductive health PERIOD The University should respond to this interest with more initiatives of a similar nature PERIOD

A good start toward destigmatizing these topics would be for the University to more prominently advertise the wideranging services offered by the UCMC and Student Health Service SHS PERIOD While having a sound infrastructure for reproductive health resources is critical these efforts are all but worthless if students remain unaware of their existence or how to access them PERIOD For example emergency contraception is available through SHS for a much lower cost than at other local pharmacies but this is not common knowledge among students PERIOD Additionally though students often rely mostly upon SHS for their common health needs the UCMC has an abundance of other resources available to students including affordable payment plans and outside funding sources for abortions through the Ryan Center PERIOD

Sex Week occurring the week of February  combines education and discussion to bring an entire week of activities to students ranging from workshops and seminars to simply tabling and giving out information PERIOD Funded in part by the Deans Fund and the Student Government Finance Committee SGFC this will be the first Sex Week to take place on UChicagos campus PERIOD Many University offices will be represented during Sex Weeks activities including Health Promotion and Wellness and the Office of LGBTQ Student Life PERIOD The University should also take advantage of the structure of Sex Week to directly publicize the many medical resources available to students at SHS and UCMC PERIOD The University could also offer permanent institutional support to Sex Week ensuring that such initiatives and the dialogue they engender endure and arent predicated on student efforts to gain funding PERIOD Lastly it should take a cue from Sex Weeks activities and help facilitate conversation throughout the quarter not just for a single week in February PERIOD

With greater attempts to connect students to extant resources the University can continue to promote safe sex practices and knowledge of reproductive health resources PERIOD In light of the introduction of new enterprises like Ci3 it would be a shame for students to have reason to complain about an alleged lack of resources provided by the University PERIOD Sex Week and efforts like it indicate wider interest among students in discussing sexual and reproductive health PERIOD Now is an ideal time for the University to more systematically foster and promote it PERIOD
