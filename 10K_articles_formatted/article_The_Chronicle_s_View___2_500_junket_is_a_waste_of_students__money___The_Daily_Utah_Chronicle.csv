490,2023-10-23,"recently the Associated Students of the University of Utah sent three of its outgoing leaders on a  junket to Boston PERIOD The reasons given by the administration for the trip ranged from the need to use nonrefundable airline tickets to platitudes of Were still in office. the irony of the trip cannot go unnoticed by even the most casual of observersthe purpose of the trip was to see how ASUU could make student groups more accountable with money received from student fees PERIOD
It seems that one way that ASUU might keep students more accountable with the money it receives is to be accountable itself PERIOD The simple fact that some tickets were purchased by accident does not warrant such an egregious waste of student money PERIOD
Furthermore perhaps the time has come to explain why it was necessary for ASUU President Adrian Johnson to take a trip to College Station Texas on the students dime the same week the Utah football team played a game there PERIOD How did such a trip benefit the students of the U
The time has come for ASUU to step down from its ivory tower of student government PERIOD The time has come for those who work in ASUU to realize that the positions they hold are positions of service not privilege PERIOD
The level of campus involvement at the U is as high as it has ever been in recent memory PERIOD More students are going to football games participating in campus activities and yes voting in student elections PERIOD
With added activity comes added interest PERIOD Future leaders of ASUU would be wise to learn from the current administrations mistakes PERIOD 
ASUU is not a club on campus where students can sign up to go on free trips and eat pizza PERIOD ASUU is a means for students to help student groups on campus create a community of diverse opportunities of campus involvement PERIOD ASUU should not be a student groupit should support student groups PERIOD
So before next years student body leaders sign up for a trip to Tucson Ariz. the weekend the football team plays the Wildcats they might want to think long and hard about whether such a trip really does serve the best interests of the student body PERIOD 
It is no secret that many on the U campus are commuters PERIOD It is also no secret that many students on this campus work parttime if not fulltime jobs PERIOD Many people on this campus are married and worry about issues such as child care medical insurance and mortgages PERIOD Many students live from one paycheck to the next PERIOD 
And many students do not need to have their money wasted on pet projects and Spring Break vacations PERIOD If ASUU would like to bring accountability to student government it starts at the top and trickles down PERIOD
