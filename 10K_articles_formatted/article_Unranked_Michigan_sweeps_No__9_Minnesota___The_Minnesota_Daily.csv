Freshman forward Brannon McManus celebrates after scoring his goal late in the third period against Michigan on Friday PERIOD

by  Drew CovePublished  January  

Gophers players said after Fridays loss that they would need a jolt of energy to turn the weekend around and beat the Wolverines Saturday PERIOD

The team held a playersonly meeting to ensure they saw a change before the next game PERIOD

But No PERIOD  Minnesota   Big Ten didnt have the jump on Saturday and the Gophers finished winless in four tries against Michigan   Big Ten this season losing the final game  and dropping the season series  PERIOD

Tonight they got two quick ones captain Tyler Sheehy said PERIOD We put ourselves in a hole like that and its hard to come back. like Friday Saturday began with the Gophers going down early PERIOD

The first goal for Michigan came on its first shot of the game PERIOD The Wolverines padded their lead with another goal  into the game PERIOD Before the Gophers settled in they found themselves down  PERIOD

As the game progressed sometimes we got in our own way head coach Don Lucia said PERIOD The harder you try the worse it gets PERIOD Then you start to become individualistic and you dont share the puck and make the right play because youre trying too hard. lucia said many of the Gophers problems would be solved if the usual offensive talent provided the scoring PERIOD It was forward Darian Romanko who scored the lone goal Saturday just his third of the season PERIOD

Minnesotas offense is tied for forty-first in college hockey PERIOD The team has not scored goals to send games into overtime or comeback PERIOD

Guys arent having the years that they want Sheehy said PERIOD Its a team effort every night weve just got to come together these next  games and then in the postseason weve got to be great. the team couldnt find enough offense to come within reach and by the time four minutes had passed in the first period Michigan had scored the eventual gamewinning goal PERIOD

The Wolverines offense got scoring from the toptwo lines with a goal each coming from forwards Brendan Warren Josh Norris and Cooper Marody PERIOD

The message after Fridays loss was that players especially veterans on the team needed a better start from the first drop of the puck but the message Saturday was to get the team on the same page for the last  games of the season PERIOD

What were doing right now isnt working and we know that Romanko said PERIOD Weve got to get everyone on the same page and just buy into the system. get MN Daily NEWS delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday
