Saudi Arabia does not have the strongest track record in terms of freedom of speech or democracy PERIOD The most recent blunder for the monarchyruled country has been the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi PERIOD

A longestablished fact was that journalist and Saudi Arabian citizen Jamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey to retrieve marriagerelated documents and was killed while he was inside the building PERIOD His fianc was waiting outside for him and eventually reported his disappearance after he did not come back out PERIOD

The debate that exploded about Khashoggis killing was a matter of who was responsible for his murder PERIOD While obvious signs pointed towards Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman the prince and highranking officials denied claims that the killing was ordered by the Saudi government PERIOD After a series of different and conflicting stories the New York Times reported that the CIA concluded that prince Salman ordered the killing himself PERIOD

The conclusion may not have been shocking to those familiar with the matter PERIOD What was shocking was President Donald Trumps response PERIOD

About a week after the CIAs conclusion was made public Trump announced his own reinterpretation of the new intelligence PERIOD According to the New York Times Trump said that the CIA only had feelings about the killing PERIOD He also reiterated an opinion that jobs resources and diplomatic benefits with Saudi Arabia are too important to the United States PERIOD

Trump has refused to speak out against Salman PERIOD

International diplomacy is never as simple as denouncing an immoral act followed by justice PERIOD Sovereign nations decide when and how they react to condemnation PERIOD Whether or not anything would actually change is debatable PERIOD What should be concerning is the presidents inaction PERIOD

Meanwhile the president has consistently threatened sending troops and shutting down the southern border in response to a caravan of migrants PERIOD Trump cares more about a group of unarmed migrants than a serious threat to free speech PERIOD

In the vast sea of antiTrump opinion thinkpieces it is easy to lose focus PERIOD Khashoggi was a profree speech writer from a conflicted area of the world PERIOD He was advocating for freedom through his thoughts and words PERIOD

Silence from the top diplomat of the United States of America sends a signal to Saudi Arabia and rest of the world murdering journalists critical to governments is okay PERIOD

This situation ascends far past party lines PERIOD Its up to American citizens to hold their nation and Saudi Arabia accountable for crimes against free speech PERIOD A murdered journalist overseas today can easily become a murdered journalist at home tomorrow PERIOD
