A student representing students. there can be no decisions about students without students. the candidates for Madison City Council District  Matthew Mitnick and Avra Reddy agree on many things chief among them their commitment to representing students PERIOD They also agree on the importance of seeking affordable housing in Madison increasing public safety on campus funding developments in public transportation and many other public service issues PERIOD

Both candidates have advocated for the expansion of late night bus services supported the Bus Rapid Transit initiative promoted medical amnesty laws and championed diversity in Madison and its government PERIOD

Mitnick comes to the race with experience in legislative affairs Associated Students of Madison local government and advocacy work while Reddy brings a history of elected office as she has previously served as a student representative for her districts school board PERIOD

With two similarly oriented and equally experienced and dedicated candidates this board did not come to an endorsement decision easily or without extensive deliberation PERIOD

Two UW freshmen declare candidacy for campus seat on Madison City CouncilTwo University of Wisconsin freshmen declared they are running for the campus district in the Madison City Council after incumbent Read

This is a good problem to have  both candidates have progressive goals which would steer Madison and the University of Wisconsin in the right direction and this board is excited to have students seeking to represent their peers PERIOD But with aggressive goals must come creative innovative plans to achieve them and that is why this board is proud to endorse Avra Reddy for Madison City Councils District  seat PERIOD

Plaguing the minds of UW students and a frequent topic of discussion in this race has been the need for more student affordable housing PERIOD Reddy and Mitnick have each proposed plans for expanding access to affordable housing but Reddys plan stands out as more pragmatic and realistic PERIOD

Mitnick has leaned heavily into his plans to leverage tax incremental financing to subsidize student housing PERIOD On paper TIF is pretty simple PERIOD Over time through infrastructure projects and private development the value of a property appreciates PERIOD The gap between the base value and the appreciated value is called the increment and that money can be reinvested into infrastructure development and public projects PERIOD Mitnicks intention is to explore how he can use that money to create more affordable housing options for students PERIOD

But as it stands TIF wont work the way Mitnick hopes it will for two reasons PERIOD

First for TIF to work the district needs to have a tax increment district from which to pull the funds PERIOD Madison has a number of TIDs around the city but District  does not currently have one PERIOD According to current District  City Council member Zach Wood without a TID to collect that increment there is no money to spend. second Section . of the City of Madison TIF Goals Objectives and Process states that student housing  shall not be funded with TIF except if it has a significant affordable component. uW students set their sights on local elections to bolster campus representation in city governmentIt was a year destined to be seared in our national memory PERIOD Defined by a wave of protest movements  Read

In other words currently TIF funds are expressly unavailable to subsidize student housing PERIOD

Mitnick has recognized these issues and he has expressed an intent to work with the council to create a TID and change the student housing restrictions PERIOD But this board believes such plans are not sufficiently innovative to ultimately yield the desired result PERIOD

Wood said he has spent much of his time in office working toward similar goals as Mitnick and the plan Mitnick has outlined is more or less copy and pasted from the city and state government website on how legally to create TID so its not really strategy. furthermore for the creation of a TID to be possible Mitnick would have to be more supportive of highdensity housing development PERIOD Mitnick has said he is in support of this type of development under certain conditions but to create the necessary appreciation in property value the district would need to see more highdensity housing development than Mitnicks desired regulations would allow PERIOD

Reddy however is committed to a more diverse set of goals for increasing student housing affordability PERIOD She has proposed plans to incentivize housing cooperatives protect tenant rights support investment in Housing First policies and support highdensity housing development  the combination of which will create ample opportunity for improvement of the affordable housing situation in Madison PERIOD

While Mitnick has voiced some support for a few of these initiatives as well Reddys intensive commitment to a wide range of feasible solutions gives this board confidence she will find more success in seeking affordable housing PERIOD

Campusarea aldermanic district candidates debate ahead of April  electionAvra Reddy and Matthew Mitnick two University of Wisconsin freshman running for Madisons District  City Council seat debated issues Read

Aside from housing both candidates have voiced their commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion within the district PERIOD This board holds the opinion that the best way to champion diversity is to ensure that the council itself is as diverse as its many constituents PERIOD

Frustratingly District  has not been represented by a woman since  and it has never before been represented by a woman of color PERIOD We have immense faith in Reddys ability to magnify the voices of historically marginalized and underrepresented groups in Madison and we are excited that Reddy has made a concerted effort to do so PERIOD

My campaign isnt just about me Reddy said PERIOD Its about every resident of the eighth district that wants their voice to be heard at City Hall especially those who have traditionally had their voice underrepresented  Im reaching out to communities of color womens groups advocacy groups and anyone who wants to make Madison work for everyone. this board is proud to place its trust in Avra Reddy for Madison City Council because we have confidence in her ability to achieve the goals she has laid out PERIOD Mitnicks extensive list of initiatives leaves us concerned he may be unable to follow through on his promises  an outcome which Wood said would only result in disappoints and breakdown of trust. breakdown of trust in government is certainly not what any city in this country needs right now  rather we need representatives who are bold yet pragmatic forwardthinking yet realistic and representative of the diversity in our districts PERIOD

Reddys lofty yet highly achievable goals give this board confidence that she will have a positive impact on Madisons policy as well as the districts perception of local government as a whole PERIOD
