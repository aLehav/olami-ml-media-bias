5929,2023-07-11,"one of the great accomplishments of the last century was the rise of international law PERIOD Through the League of Nations the United Nations and other transnational institutions the majority of the worlds governments agreed to limits on killing torture and brutality PERIOD International agreements including the U.N PERIOD Declaration of Human Rights the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the Convention against Torture bound even the most powerful leaders to disavow forms of violence that had been all too common in the years around the Second World War PERIOD International law promised to tame might with the force of right PERIOD

Of course international law has had its challenges PERIOD Some Asian and African countries have condemned the Westerncentered assumptions at the core of international law PERIOD Others have pointed to the inconsistency of its application PERIOD In fact the United States has promoted and violated international law simultaneously PERIOD Americans invoked universal human rights claims in their condemnation of fascist communist and other tyrannical regimes PERIOD At the same time the United States ignored these claims when made against American military interventions in Vietnam Nicaragua and Iraq PERIOD International law remains a frequent victim of power politics and the prerogatives of dominant states PERIOD

Inconsistency and incompleteness however do not negate the deep value of global limits on human brutality PERIOD Institutions and documents that condemn repression genocide and torture create a presumption against those behaviors PERIOD They encourage alternative routines and expectations PERIOD They raise the costs in reputation and respect for doing things that the international community has so strongly condemned PERIOD

Strong condemnations are indeed necessary for the brazen brutality of the Islamic State also known as ISIS operating today in Syria and Iraq PERIOD This collection of violent insurgents has seized territory and proceeded to express its power with exhibitionist killings of captured foreigners PERIOD The Islamic State has now beheaded more than  hostages and last week it went a step further burning a captured Jordanian pilot to death in a locked cage PERIOD The killings are not acts of Islamic faith which condemns such brutality but efforts to shock and frighten viewers PERIOD

In this goal the Islamic State has largely succeeded PERIOD The killers have displayed their sadism to the world with slick coldblooded videos that threaten more of the same PERIOD These videos make most viewers think twice about going to the region or sending soldiers there PERIOD The videos also recruit a small but significant subculture of alienated viewers who feel lost and powerless in their current societies PERIOD Extreme violence offers the image of power to those who lack power it promises to give the weak a chance to exact revenge against the strong PERIOD The Islamic State videos use bloodcurdling brutality to manipulate public emotions and promote more of the same PERIOD Without the limits of external force and international law violence is contagious feeding upon itself PERIOD

There are many things that the United States and its allies in various regions including the Middle East are doing to contain and ultimately defeat the Islamic State PERIOD Washington has provided military aid economic assistance and training to numerous groups fighting against the Islamic State PERIOD The United States has also used its aerial drone capabilities to identify and kill Islamic State leaders throughout the region PERIOD The perpetrators of extreme violence have inspired a strong coalition of regional and global actors supporting the destruction of the Islamic State PERIOD The United States is only one government in this coalition and it can rely on help from many others in the immediate region PERIOD

What is missing is a strong affirmation of why fighting the Islamic State is a compelling mission for believers in a world of law not arbitrary power PERIOD The greatest threat the beheadings and cage burnings pose is to undo the work of the last century PERIOD If this behavior can continue with minimal reprisal then it becomes normal again and others will follow PERIOD Some evidence of lawerosion is already evident in Russia and other countries where dictators are closely watching events in the Middle East to see what tools they might also be able to deploy against their opponents PERIOD The historical record shows that tyrants are dangerous copycats PERIOD

Fighting the Islamic State requires a broad and fullthroated condemnation of its horrors PERIOD This is a battle for law for progress and even for civilization  defined in this case as the widely accepted limits on violence against individuals PERIOD These limits allow space for the flowering of freedom selfgovernance and innovation that made the last century such a liberating moment for many groups around the world PERIOD Without the strong defense of limits on human brutality we will all be brutalized again PERIOD

The world has not escaped its anarchic and violent characteristics and the United States is responsible for numerous atrocities of its own but the sadistic inhumanity of the Islamic State destroys the very foundations for international peace and justice PERIOD As citizens we must demand that our government affirm our core values in this fight even as our leaders wisely search for the most effective ways to destroy the Islamic State from a distance PERIOD Clarity of purpose must accompany prudent military and diplomatic tactics PERIOD Everyone must know the stakes for humanity in the recent horrors and why they cannot continue PERIOD
