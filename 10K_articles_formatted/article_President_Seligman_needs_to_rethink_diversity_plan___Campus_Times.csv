First let me say I applaud President Seligmans efforts to address a very serious problem regarding faculty diversity throughout the University PERIOD It is something that is long overdue here considering that many of our peer institutions have recognized the lack of faculty of color and have implemented many measures to increase their amounts of underrepresented minorities in their faculty PERIOD The presidents convening of a special task force to address faculty diversity was the first step in recognizing a major problem that is not only faced here in Rochester but in many institutions of higher education PERIOD My happiness with the president thus goes without saying PERIOD However Im very concerned that the University is not taking all the steps it could to reach its goal PERIOD

His deputy Lynne Davidson led the task force convened by the president PERIOD The task force worked for nearly seven months on the report and put forth  recommendations to the President to increase faculty diversity all of which he adopted PERIOD The recommendations consist of Universitywide coordination of faculty diversity programs and policies a Special Opportunities Fund for diversity hiring family friendly policies and implementation of specified best practices. the first recommendation and perhaps one of the most significant initiatives calls on the president to appoint faculty diversity officers PERIOD These people will assist deans and chairs of departments in searching for faculty to help assure that there are comprehensive and consistent training standards in place and will address questions on issues such as local schools daycare and resources for special needs children PERIOD

The faculty diversity officers will be responsible for a number of other activities regarding diversity including coordinating annual reporting on the status progress and challenges of diversity PERIOD This person will ultimately be the most important person in the university with regards to faculty diversity PERIOD

While I applaud the idea of having a faculty diversity officer for each University school and the presidents acceptance of all the recommendations I do not think that the president spent enough effort and time searching for the best qualified person to fill this role PERIOD

Seligman appointed his deputy and chairperson of the task force Lynne Davidson as Vice Provost of Faculty Development and Diversity PERIOD This appointment is quite problematic considering the president did not conduct a national search to fill the position PERIOD Several weeks ago I recall asking President Seligman about the lack of diversity in his senior leadership team and he said this was something that was important to him PERIOD However he also stressed the importance of having the bestqualified person possible PERIOD

It seems to me that if diversity is valued as a key priority to this institution then the same standards that the institution used in looking for a Vice President of Communications Vice Provost of Information Technology Dean of the Faculty of the College Senior Vice President for Health Sciences and CEO of the Medical Center would likely be used in filling the new role of Vice Provost of Faculty Development and Diversity PERIOD Conducting a national search would ensure that we have a committee of different faculty members to review the applicant that there would be many applicants from diverse backgrounds and fields that the candidates would bring new ideas with them to help enhance faculty diversity before starting the job and it would show that filling this position is just as important as any other member of the presidents senior leadership team PERIOD

The presidents appointment of Davidson does not seem to uphold the principles of Meliora as it is known that she is not a member of the faculty and that her experience with issues of diversity is very limited PERIOD I think I must say that my criticism of the presidents choice is not to say that Davidson could not rise to the challenge of diversifying our faculty PERIOD However is she the most qualified person Did the University do all it could do to search for the best person for this role And if we think this is a serious effort is it perceived as a serious matter by the institution when it does not conduct national searches as it does for all other senior level appointments

Again the president and the task force should be commended for taking such initiatives to address faculty diversity with the appointment of a Vice Provost of Faculty Development and Diversity PERIOD However this process deserves to rank with the same importance of appointing any other member of the senior leadership team PERIOD The appointment of Davidson does not show that we have found the most qualified person or that this issue was a major priority PERIOD It is almost too convenient that the president names his deputy to now be the Vice Provost and lead all efforts of diversifying faculty at the University PERIOD

Addressing issues of faculty diversity will be highly challenging and should be completed by someone that has experience dealing with diversity issues or an individual who has been a member of the faculty of an institution of higher education PERIOD This is the first such position of diversity at this esteemed institution as such the position should be awarded after a national search to find the most accredited individual for the post PERIOD Meliora
