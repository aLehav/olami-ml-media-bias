The logo and color scheme featured on the sides of Wolfline buses in the new fleet are designed by two students from the College of Design PERIOD They pay tribute to staple NC State symbols such as the howling wolf and the colors red and black PERIOD

NC States Wolfline and the city of Raleighs GoRaleigh line are both adding new buses to their fleets in the next year each with a focus on sustainability and a vision for the future PERIOD

In  the city of Raleigh established a plan mandating that  of GoRaleigh buses would be comprised of compressed natural gas vehicles which leave fewer emissions than diesel or gasoline PERIOD According to David Eatman Raleigh transit administrator the city aims to continue to move toward environmentally conscious transportation PERIOD

We got our first  naturalgas vehicles in  and we are expecting  more to be in operation by September of this year Eatman said PERIOD

Now the GoRaleigh bus system also plans to integrate five new electric vehicles into their transportation network by next year PERIOD

Bryon Bryant transit manager of NCSU Transportation said over email that five new Wolfline buses have also arrived on the NC State campus this summer and are expected to run in fall  PERIOD The Wolfline fleet is comprised of clean diesel buses which meet the most recent EPA standards for clean emissions PERIOD

Each of these buses cost approximately  PERIOD Bryant said converting to a more environmentally friendly option was infeasible due to the budget and lack of charging infrastructure PERIOD

When we switched our contract in  and purchased our new fleet we did look into hybrid and electric options Bryant said PERIOD However we just did not have the financial means to do that. the GoRaleigh buses were purchased via a . million federal grant and . million of funding from the Wake County sales tax for transit according to Eatman PERIOD

Generally an electric bus fully equipped is around  Eatman said PERIOD The charging infrastructure we are still investigating but generally is around  PERIOD We had enough funding to secure five allelectric buses along with the associated charging infrastructure. while the electric buses purchased are initially more expensive than compressed natural gas or diesel buses Eatman says that in the long run the cost will even out to about the same as either alternative PERIOD This equity in cost will only become more apparent over a governmentally subsidized vehicles average life cycle approximately  years or  miles PERIOD

A diesel bus is probably the cheapest bus to operate but the life cycle cost over that 12year period is the most expensive Eatman said PERIOD

According to Bryant Wolfline buses are able to endure up to  years of service PERIOD

GoRaleigh plans to charge their new electric fleet at night and run them for a full service day before returning them to their charging stations according to Eatman PERIOD GoRaleigh recognizes the importance of the oftenoverlooked benefits of environmentally conscious vehicles PERIOD

Its something that is beyond our normal costbenefit analysis Eatman said PERIOD The true reduction and carbon emissions and try to quantify that from a health perspective the numbers really jump off the chart. bryant said that while funding for electric buses is currently unattainable NCSU Transportation is open to expanding to more environmentally friendly options if funding eventually permits PERIOD

I think there is always room for improvement Bryant said PERIOD Certainly the university is always all about protecting the environment and moving forward in reducing our carbon footprint we are more than happy to move in that direction as well. log In
