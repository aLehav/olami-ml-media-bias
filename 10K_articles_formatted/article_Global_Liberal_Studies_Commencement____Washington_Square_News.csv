Upon crossing the stage each student was given a customized stole with the flags of the sites where they had studied away PERIOD

Valedictorian Catalina Escalona gave the student address incorporating slides of paintings into her speech to represent the significant events and feelings of the students PERIOD While she described the process of settling in to GLS and undertaking a senior thesis Escalona also highlighted the third year which for GLS students is spent studying away from NYU New York PERIOD

Both at our global sites and in New York we could explore our own interests thanks to the guidance of our strong core foundation in those first two years and also with the support group of our faculty staff friends and family Escalona said. we were given the chance to complement our studies in the classroom with these outside experiences in the real world which proved to be just as essential for our global liberal studies education. emily Bell is excited to serve as blogs editor this semester Previously a managing editor Emily is a junior in Gallatin concentrating in Peace and Conflict..
