For the past several years Oberlin students have grown accustomed to the PharosUniprint system PERIOD Under this system students sent their docu ments to the printer swiped their identification cards at the corresponding print station and selected their desired document PERIOD As of the  school year the old PharosUniprint regime has been replaced by a new program called PaperCut PERIOD

With the new PaperCut system students hit print on their computers type in their username and password and the documents print automatically thereby eliminating any card swiping PERIOD

In recent weeks students have identified myriad problems with this new system including having to print documents twice PERIOD Often because documents dont seem to reach the printer students are forced to reprint and are subsequently charged multiple times PERIOD

Ive been having a hard time figuring out where my print quota is College senior Kaylee Holt said Ive sent things to the printer and they dont print PERIOD Youve wasted credit and your papers are not printed  I dont see the pointof eliminating the card swiping. she added Id rather just have my ID with me and avoid all these other weird problems. the College decided to im plement new printing technol ogy last year PERIOD After a fiveyear Pharos regime the Center for Information Technology decided that an update was in order PERIOD It was time to evaluate said CIT employee Chester Andrews of the upgrade PERIOD Computer hardware gets old and needs to be replaced  it was time to think about something else. according to Andrews the new system is more cost effective for the College PERIOD It costs about half as much as the old system and students still receive their  per semester print quota PERIOD Yet their quota notwithstanding some students find the new system more costly PERIOD

College senior Sarah Cole said the system has become more expensive to me. and while it is possible to ask for a refund Cole noted that she is afraid to ask for help with these problems. holt agreed PERIOD Its not worth the hassle to get my  cents a page back. andrews who was involved with PaperCuts implementa tion explained The card swiping was eliminated because we found it to be a positive thing and more desirable because it reduced the number of machines we have to maintain. in other words fewer machines potentially yield fewer problems PERIOD There were periods of frustration even with the older system Andrews said in response to the mention of printing angst PERIOD But with a littlebit of time we can work out any issues we have. andrews said that CIT intends to remedy these issues PERIOD We are aware of some problems and issues we are working to work those out. according to Andrews some  pages have been successfully printed since Aug PERIOD  and opportunities for refunds abound Every student can request a refund for their account or by clicking on the PaperCut links on their lab computer PERIOD Weve been granting refunds in nearly every case Andrews explained PERIOD You have an opportunity to explain why you didnt get your printout PERIOD We are really veryhappy to grant refunds as we are working through the bugs. andrews while cognizant of student frustration said he was hopeful that within the next week or two or so well have all the bugs in the system worked out. unpacking University of Michigan Football Scandal
