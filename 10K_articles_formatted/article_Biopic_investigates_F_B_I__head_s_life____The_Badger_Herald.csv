2747,2011-11-13,"compelling and emotional J PERIOD Edgar will captivate audiences PERIOD Director Clint Eastwood Hereafter and writer Dustin Lance Black Milk outdid themselves in recounting the remarkable life of the late J PERIOD Edgar Hoover who served nearly  years as the face of law enforcement in America PERIOD

Leonardo DiCaprio plays the difficult role of Hoover a man bottling up his sensitive emotions and sexual denial to maintain his image as a stern and innovative crime stopper PERIOD

It all begins in  when precocious 24yearold Hoover starts working for the Justice Department PERIOD He immediately finds flaws in the way crime is handled and deems Americans unsafe especially from communism which he considers a disease rather than a political party PERIOD

Hoover serves as a narrator throughout the movie recalling past crimes he has solved to teach young agents how legends are made PERIOD However as the tale unfolds it becomes clear that Hoovers reality is deluded with subconscious musings actually making the arrests rather than strictly acting as the brains behind the operations PERIOD

The film spotlights not only Hoovers successes like normalizing fingerprinting and mastering the Dewey Decimal System but also his weaknesses and how he corruptly maintains absolute power within the Justice Department over a long period of time PERIOD

For instance Hoover was not above using blackmail to obtain the results he desired PERIOD He possessed a secret love letter written to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt from her female lover and a voice recording of President John F PERIOD Kennedy having an affair.This element of including real pieces of Americas most shocking history in the film is captivating informative and attentiongrabbing PERIOD

As a wholeEastwoods direction is brilliant PERIOD Audiences will wonder if the film is shot from Hoovers perspective or his peers.It is not until the end that one questions Hoovers direct involvement with the war against communists the search for the kidnapper of the Lindbergh baby and the prosecution of outlaws like John Dillinger PERIOD

The perceived integrity and value of Hoovers work seems reliant on the support of his mother Judi Dench Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides and the presence of his number two man Clyde Tolson Armie Hammer The Social Network PERIOD

Hoover uses Tolson as a crutch never giving him the power to be a standalone leader but exploiting him to support his own control within the Bureau PERIOD As the film progresses it is clear there is unexpressed sexual tension between the men both of who are peculiarly uninterested in women and a social life outside of each others company PERIOD Despite maintaining separate residences they worked side by side ate meals together daily and went on joint vacations PERIOD

No concrete relationship is ever established between them but they develop a deep understanding of each other that is not revealed or understood by any other characters with the possible exception of Hoovers loyal assistant Ms PERIOD Gandy Naomi Watts Dream House PERIOD But near its endJ PERIOD Edgar takes a romantic turn when Hoover and Tolson express a longawaited yet heartwarming gesture of love PERIOD

Beyond the script and direction conveying a compelling message J PERIOD Edgar has interesting and powerful camerawork spoton period costumes and outstanding makeup PERIOD

The camera angles were used to make Hoover appear more dominant PERIOD They often shot at low angles that made him appear both large in size and powerful in personality PERIOD And asthe movie takes viewers through different time periods the costumes and scenery change fluidly PERIOD

Even as the movies plot travels forward in time Hoover Tolson and Gandy remain pivotal PERIOD At times it is hard to believe that the man playing Hoover is in fact Leonardo DiCaprio because his visage and acting as an old man is so convincing PERIOD

The film is compelling emotional informational and downright enthralling PERIOD With a starstudded cast backed up by great direction J PERIOD Edgar is a mustsee film of the year PERIOD

Four stars out of five
