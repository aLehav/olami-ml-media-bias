The band that performs  shows per year has come to Hawaii PERIOD
Warsaw Poland Bros known for their intense touring schedule
concludes a tour of Hawaii this weekend with performances in
Honolulu and Kailua on Oahu and Paia on Maui PERIOD

For musiclovers unfamiliar with the band  is a
good album to start with even though it was released in  PERIOD On
the Web site for their recording label Invisible Mass it was
called 

 epitomizes the bands myriad of influences PERIOD
Although they identify themselves as a ska band with CDs titled
 and  the tracks on 
exhibit a variety of musical genres including swing reggae pop
and punk PERIOD

The songs convey not only a diverse range of musical genres but
a large range of moods and tempos as well PERIOD Some of the songs are
slower and feel more relaxing while others have a quicker more
upbeat pace PERIOD

The first song  illustrates the influence of
reggae on the band PERIOD The reggae returns in 
accompanied by trumpets and also in the last song  The reggae and ska influence permeates the
entire album and can be found to varying degrees in almost every
song PERIOD

The music of  brings to mind the 1960s pop of
The Beatles while  and 
with the presence of trumpets have a strong influence of swing and
blues PERIOD

Chris Poland aka Crix channels Sammy Davis Jr PERIOD with the vocals
in  pulling in an atmosphere of the lounge singer
from around the 1950s PERIOD

The salsalike rhythm of  will have listeners tapping
their feet PERIOD  is a combination of different genres
starting off with a riff that sounds as if it was pulled from a
1950s or 60s beach movie but it quickly shifts to a Smash
Mouthlike style from their album 

There are a few tracks such as  in the beginning
which are unnecessary PERIOD In the liner notes Chris Poland explains
that he thought it helped set the mood but thats difficult to do
with an album whose style shifts with each song PERIOD  is only
a few seconds long and is difficult to understand PERIOD However since
it is so short its easily overlooked and doesnt detract from
enjoying the rest of the album PERIOD

Also uneccessary is the start of track   It sounds like answering machine messages from fans and
people associated with the band set to a simple background of
mellow techno music PERIOD The track is tollerable if youre working on
something else and only half paying attention PERIOD But when you stop to
really listen to the words  is too long to be
entertaining PERIOD

For music aficionados the wide variety of styles may be
appealing PERIOD For others the diversity of Warsaw and their CD may be
undesired because they may enjoy swing but dislike the sound
similar to that of bands such as No Doubt who Warsaw Poland Bros PERIOD
have toured with in the past PERIOD

It is difficult to place  into one genre of music
because of these various influences but fans of ska music and
reggae ought to enjoy the majority of the tracks PERIOD
