The University of Tennessee has changed with the times boasting a minority enrollment that continues to rise PERIOD As campus diversity changes campus activities change as well PERIOD UT has more than  student organizations including social groups religious denominations volunteer organizations and professional societies PERIOD Students are promised to fit in somewhere PERIOD If not then they have the opportunity to do as many before them did and start new organizations that reflect their ideas and passions PERIOD

UT offers a great sense of community among minorities said LaShara Quinn a sophomore in journalism PERIOD There are many organizations that provide opportunities to be around students of your ethnicity but there are ample opportunities to be with those from different backgrounds as well PERIOD Coming to UT gives students a glimpse of the real world  different kinds of people from different places with different cultures PERIOD Being on such a diverse campus as this one will help me be a wellrounded person. organizations such as Minority Nurses Organization National Organization of Minority Architects and National Society of Black Engineers give minorities an opportunity to come together with others in their major to help each other succeed PERIOD In addition oncampus facilities such as the Black Cultural Center offer services to assist minority students in handling the challenges of college and provides a place where they can meet other students from diverse backgrounds PERIOD

The Black Cultural Center is undeniably an excellent resource for minorities said Marshay James a senior in nursing PERIOD The book loan program and free tutoring have played an integral part in minority retention PERIOD But I think more majors could use minority organizations that will better serve their interests and needs. james is the current president of the Minority Nurses Organization and thinks this minority organization is selfserving PERIOD

As a minority its important to learn how to help yourself she said PERIOD MSNO is doing a good job at helping the members network and move on to the next step. there are many places to go on campus to view diversity in action PERIOD Like the Black Cultural Center the International House features culture nights that give students a chance to learn something new and meet new and interesting people PERIOD

Places such as the International House and the Black Cultural Center let me know that the university is really concerned with catering to the needs of minorities on campus said Shaneka Hampton a junior in exercise science PERIOD I am so glad to know that all the diversity talk is not just a gimmick PERIOD This campus embraces all cultures and supports their ideas by encouraging the different cultural organizations. uT seems to be moving in the right direction but some students think there are still a few things left to be done PERIOD

A diversity class or discussion should be a requirement for freshmen something similar to the Life of the Mind program Quinn said PERIOD I feel that a lot of people have preconceived notions about AfricanAmericans and other minority groups PERIOD I think a discussion on diversity would especially help students from small towns that may have not been exposed to people of a different ethnicity than their own. qiana Powell a junior in nutrition thinks not enough focus has been put on recruiting Native Americans PERIOD

I think there should be more scholarships for us she said PERIOD There are places with a significant amount of Native Americans and a lot of times they dont get informed of opportunities for them to go to college. the effectiveness of providing scholarship opportunities such as the Hope scholarship AfricanAmerican Achievers and AfricanAmerican Incentive Grant has been proven by the newsmaking rise in enrollment of AfricanAmerican students PERIOD

The Hope Scholarship definitely had a lot to do with the huge minority increase Quinn said PERIOD More scholarship opportunities for minorities give those who cannot otherwise afford to go to college a chance to further their education. log In
