For the past few months I have been writing a book PERIOD It is about fashion and journalism and how these two industries are intertwined and how they can both benefit from each other PERIOD This book is a way of portraying myself and introducing myself to the worlds of fashion and journalism  the industries I want to go into PERIOD In this book I will talk about my journey of getting into these fields PERIOD When it comes to fashion I will talk about how I entered that field through social media and modeling PERIOD As for journalism I will talk about how I originally came to Hofstra for screenwriting  I wanted to write for movies or since I am also into theater write scripts for the stage PERIOD I started off with drama as my major but I didnt like the courses so I thought maybe I should give myself a chance to explore other kinds of writing PERIOD I said You know what Lets try journalism maybe youll be interested in it who knows At first I didnt really see myself as a journalist but then I wound up falling in love with it PERIOD In my five years of high school  because I am Italian and we have five years of high school in Italy  I learned that two things were not going to be in my life science and math PERIOD Those were the two things that I just could not do PERIOD They are important and I admire people who can do those things but I cannot PERIOD I just knew I wanted to be a writer that was my thing PERIOD I also had a goal to represent the underrepresented PERIOD I wanted to give a voice to people who look like me but I didnt know how to do that or what kind of writing would lend its hand to that PERIOD I eventually realized I could do that through journalism PERIOD Its always been a dream of mine to see someone who looks like me get to tell their story  or even someone who looks differently from me but has a unique story background or heritage  I just want to see more diversity PERIOD I started writing this book with the New Degree Press and I am a part of this program directed by them and also the Creator Institute founded by a professor Eric Koester from Georgetown University PERIOD Ive been writing the book since I would say October or November but November is when I started actually writing and doing my research PERIOD As of now I cannot say when the book will be finished I do not yet know when Ill be done writing it PERIOD I will start crowdsourcing for the funds and everything but that is a marketing strategy that we are still needing to work on PERIOD So far I have just been working on the manuscript PERIOD Even if the deal does not go through at least I can say that I have written a book and that  words of mine are out there in the world. please note that only current Hofstra students can become part of our staff writing team PERIOD
