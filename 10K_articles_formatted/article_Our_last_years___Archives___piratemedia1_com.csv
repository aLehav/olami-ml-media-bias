Partly cloudy skies PERIOD Low 44F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Since the beginnings of civilization the end has been near PERIOD Today tomorrow or  years from now someone is bound to get it right eventually PERIOD The biggest problems with predicting the end I think involve where we look PERIOD Many people have been looking in the Christian Bible for clues for centuries PERIOD But before Jesus was even born another race and creed had not only correctly predicted doomsday but also put scientific backing to it PERIOD

December   will signify the completion of the thirteenth Baktun cycle in the Long Count of the Maya calendar PERIOD According to the Mayans this shall usher in a great change which they recognize basically as the end of the world PERIOD Laugh all you want but on this day of Solstice some modernday scientists also believe that the entire polarity of the Earth will shift PERIOD Volcanoes erupting hurricanes forming in seconds mountains crumble and fall in mere seconds PERIOD Everything that really sucks will happen in one day PERIOD

Well even if all of this does happen odds are that not everyone will die PERIOD And into this scenario I place myself PERIOD I am not going to die on December   PERIOD Not only because I recognize that I am not going to die but also because I have a plan PERIOD Now we all have our zombie invasion plans andor World War III plans but in the hell that will be  you need to start from scratch PERIOD The big things to consider here are how not to die and if so how not to die miserably PERIOD Anything past the Mississippi is going to be absolutely annihilated when the supervolcano in Yellowstone blows PERIOD The Southeast will more than likely flood completely when hurricanes begin forming every hour PERIOD Going north is no better PERIOD Not only will the North Pole melt but also Canada and the ensuing flood will have no mercy especially when it meets the southern floods PERIOD I couldnt possibly imagine going to Mexico for anything more than a vacation so there is no possibility of escape there either PERIOD South America would be a great place for salvation if an asteroid wasnt hitting it in  so I wont bother getting comfortable PERIOD

The safest place will be the MiddleEast PERIOD It is an obvious choice It is our original Eden there are TONS of guns to battle the roaming streets gangs of the future and due to the massive climate change it probably wont be that hot PERIOD Unfortunately it is thousands of miles away and flying is the best way to go PERIOD I am not sure when I am leaving but for anyone following my plans fly BEFORE Dec PERIOD  not on PERIOD If you have a fear of flying then steal a boat and if you have a fear of both then keep a tab of cyanide in your teeth PERIOD

So now I have made it and as stated I am alive PERIOD Mission accomplished but I and all the other survivors must rebuild civilization PERIOD Some may think that in the scary ravaged and poor aftermath of Dec PERIOD  living in the MiddleEast sounds like a death sentence PERIOD These people are not thinking PERIOD This area already has lived in mass poverty been exploited and subjugated for centuries PERIOD Needless to say they have been expecting the Apocalypse PERIOD Not to mention that Islam obviously being the dominant religion of the future has perfect rules with perfect penalties for such a dangerous future PERIOD The gangs of the future either attempting to spread their doctrine steal gas or pillage will have a hell of a time contending with postapocalyptic Islamic Law PERIOD In fact after the initial defense against these roving gangs Muslims will more than likely go on the offensive reclaiming most of the old Islamic Kingdom PERIOD

By this time though I think things will have really gotten out of hand and I will attempt to leave PERIOD If I can make it out and survive the miles of barren land then I will attempt to head somewhere in Europe PERIOD The future jungles of Europe will more than likely be infested with zombies and you are making a life choice to live among them PERIOD But there is little leeway in the future and your choices are two zombies or NeoIslam PERIOD

If you do manage to survive and go through with my plan or your own then I suggest a balance of these two PERIOD In what order I am not sure though PERIOD I think starting with NeoIslam will make it easier to live with zombies but perhaps you will need divine light after dealings with the zombie population PERIOD Either order isnt so bad though as all the negatives of the past racism and money will be demolished and life will not only be happier but violently simplistic PERIOD
