COVID19 not only instilled panic and paranoia in Americans because of spread and infection but the fear of isolation and dwelling in ones thoughts PERIOD I was one of the many who fell victim to this PERIOD As a film enthusiast I looked to cinema to avoid these anxieties rather than face them PERIOD Amongst those who powered me through quarantine is Oliver Stone PERIOD

Oliver Stone is an American film director best known for his work Natural Born Killers  and Platoon  PERIOD After being introduced to his work by a colleague two films changed my perspective on film media and America PERIOD

The first film of Stones that I watched was 2016s Snowden walking in completely unaware PERIOD Snowdens intelligence is intensely thoughtprovoking PERIOD Snowden follows the story of Edward Snowden who was contracted by the National Security Agency and leaks classified information after experiencing disillusionment with the Intelligence Community PERIOD He is then exiled becoming an enemy to some a hero to others and a fugitive from his own country PERIOD

The cinematic depictions of the invasion of privacy leaves you unsettled PERIOD Americans unsuspecting are being monitored and accessed at any time PERIOD It is evident that Stone intended on calling the government out for unconstitutional surveillance misuse of information and corrupted power PERIOD This doesnt limit in any capacity a love for your country but instead expands the viewers patriotism if one believes that dissent is patriotic PERIOD

Joseph GordonLevitt a beloved actor plays the role of Snowden though many note him as underrated but exemplary for the part PERIOD The film alone doesnt rely on its dialogue but instead a fragmented structure defined by visual effects to allude to time and unveiling which works well for such a complex story PERIOD

Stone took advantage of the realism element that drives the plot home in the end PERIOD The end introduces us to a seamless clip of the real Snowden speaking to us from exile still exuding patriotism in an ethically subversive manner PERIOD

I was mesmerized by my years of oblivion after this film PERIOD Not because I was unaware of one event but noticing this is me officially taking off the rosetinted glasses and seeing the world through a flawed lens PERIOD Thats how I got through 1991s JFK PERIOD

This film has a stellar cast that has to be mentioned off the bat varying from Kevin Costner Joe Pesci and Kevin Bacon PERIOD JFK is a drama that investigates the assassination of President John F PERIOD Kennedy PERIOD Jim Garrison lead New Orleans District Attorney on the case begins to feel doubt about how the murder transpired and closes the case after heavy government backlash PERIOD Garrison discovered compelling evidence that causes him to reopen the investigation and reveal a conspiracy that was behind Kennedys death PERIOD

Stone was criticized before and after the release of the film but that doesnt change the narrative on what could have happened that tragic historical day PERIOD Garrison himself was one of the only people at that time that challenged the accepted verdict and called into question other possible leads though in the end we are still left to question PERIOD

This film provides evidence within to demonstrate the falsehood of the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman PERIOD The primary evidence that belies this theory is Abraham Zapruders home movie that was taken that fatal day PERIOD This film is meant to leave you questioning even after Garrison details the entire plot in the courtroom putting all the pieces together in his perspective on how everything took place and why PERIOD

That was the moment everything clicked PERIOD It had nothing to do with Kennedy at that point but seeking the truth and exposing a front orchestrated by powerful people who believed they could do whatever they wanted PERIOD Just like Kennedy Garrison fears his bold actions may lead to something more dangerous PERIOD

Ive noticed that about life recently its dangerous especially living in a pandemic but we still search for the veracity of stories and news coverage around us because we as citizens need to know the truth PERIOD Both Snowden and JFK urge the viewer to be more than just a spectator PERIOD Be a citizen PERIOD Demand the truth from your government PERIOD You shouldnt believe everything you hear but its your responsibility to find the facts and generate your own conclusions PERIOD Some around me say Stone failed with these films but I disagree PERIOD He opened my eyes PERIOD
