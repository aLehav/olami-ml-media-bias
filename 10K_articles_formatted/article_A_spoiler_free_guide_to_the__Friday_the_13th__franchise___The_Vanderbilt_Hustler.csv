Friday the thirteenth is in my opinion the best slasher series PERIOD While the quality is inconsistent the cast and crew change drastically every film and the lore is almost nonexistent  the franchises chaos is what makes it so beautiful PERIOD Ive seen all the movies more times than Id like to admit but for the uninitiated Ive written the ultimate viewing guide tailored to what youre looking for PERIOD

Before discussing each film heres a quick glossary of horror terms

Sleaze Films that are sleazy are ones with excessive deaths and gore PERIOD They are films that make your stomach churn as characters find their dead peers gruesome remains PERIOD

Scares The scares in the franchise are mostly jump scares and gore meaning those who watch a lot of slashers may not find these movies scary PERIOD

Camp Campy films are ones that you can laugh at PERIOD Whether its a weird dance scene bad SFX or a ridiculous plotline these films shouldnt be taken too seriously PERIOD

Plot Movies that are in this category are not necessarily ones with a strong plot PERIOD Rather theyre ones that strongly contribute to the overall plot of the franchise PERIOD

If you are interested in understanding the series as a whole but arent ready to commit to watching twelve movies there are a few movies with plots that carry over PERIOD Ive created two versions of optimal watching order excluding movies that are not absolutely integral to understanding the developments of the franchise PERIOD

These films have a protagonist Tommy Jarvis that returns in an attempt to put Jason Voorhees the series main antagonist and hockey mask afficionado and his trauma to rest PERIOD Tommy is the closest Friday the thirteenth has to a Nancy Thompson or a Laurie Strode as in a recurring final girlprotagonist PERIOD There are two versions one being an abridged version PERIOD The reason I recommend to start with Part I or II even though Tommy doesnt show up until IV is because they allow you to understand Jason Voorhees backstory and motivation PERIOD

The creation of the first film in the series was prompted by the success of Halloween  PERIOD Friday the thirteenth is still one of the most successful and influential independent horror films of all time PERIOD Barry Abrams cinematography likely inspired by the original Psycho employs plenty of pointofview shots from the killers perspective which I am a sucker for PERIOD While Psycho was a key originator of the shot Friday the thirteenth helped popularize it PERIOD Many nonfranchised slashers released after  included them cementing the whodunit element eventually satirized in Scream. while not the best film in the series by a long shot its a solid entry PERIOD

The second film takes the best parts of the first film and improves upon them immensely PERIOD Its final girl name redacted for spoilers is easily my favorite final girl of all time PERIOD The way she defeats the killer is incredibly unique and works as a perfect resolution PERIOD It is much campier than the first film in a beautiful way PERIOD If you are only going to watch one film this should be it PERIOD

Part III was originally released as a 3D film which I am incredibly sad to have missed out on PERIOD It was meant to follow the previous films final girl once again but that was scrapped once her actress declined to reprise her role PERIOD Part III has the most onscreen deaths of the series so far PERIOD While it certainly is a solid movie it lacks a solid amount of camp or worldbuilding that Part II had PERIOD However Jason does finally get his iconic hockey mask yes it took three movies which is definitely an important milestone PERIOD

As indicated by the title this was meant to be the end of the series and if it was it would be a great sendoff PERIOD The original makeup artist Tom Savini returned and Tommy Jarvis obsession with creating macabre masks was a homage to Savini PERIOD Tommy also serves as a parallel to Jason especially considering that Jasons first appearance in the series was him as a child PERIOD

Despite the intention to focus on melodrama and plot there still is plenty of camp PERIOD Jimmys dance scene is in my personal camp hall of fame PERIOD

This film is easily the sleaziest so far having almost twice the kills as its predecessors PERIOD It follows a traumatized teenage Tommy while he recovers in the Pinehurst Halfway House PERIOD He meets his fellow patients staff and Reggie the Reckless yet another child played by Shavar Ross and the characters are undeveloped but memorable PERIOD This film is mostly focused on the kills and camp PERIOD If you want a goofy gruesome film this is a great choice PERIOD

Part VI is very very close to defeating Part II for the best film in the series PERIOD The movie returns to Camp Crystal Lake now called Camp Forest Green PERIOD Its full of meta humor  a decade before Scream became famous for it PERIOD While building a world that has existed for five previous movies is difficult its done well especially compared to later entries in the franchise PERIOD

Part VI was the first film to receive critical success after Part II and while I usually recommend ignoring a mainstream critics opinion on slashers I think that the acclaim confirms this films broad appeal PERIOD I would recommend seeing at least Parts II and IV to appreciate the buildup PERIOD

Not everybody will love this movie.The best way to describe this film is Carrie versus Jason PERIOD While that may sound absurd it is executed in a way that is perfectly camp. this brand of camp doesnt have broad appeal some will find it tedious PERIOD But if a hodgepodge of the original Firestarter Carrie and Jaws sounds like a fun time youll probably enjoy this film PERIOD

This movie is the first one to feature Kane Hodder as Jason the only actor to reprise the role and his experience as a stuntman makes him perfect for the role of the silent killer PERIOD Additionally the makeup in this movie is some of the best PERIOD

Despite being ranked the second lowest I still enjoy Part VIII PERIOD It perfectly encapsulates the grungy punk feel of the late 80s and early 90s PERIOD There are women randomly playing guitars toxic waste and punks that kidnap people PERIOD Like the previous installment theres a lot of camp but it combines that with plenty of sleaze PERIOD Like Part VII I really enjoy the special effects and most of the films are consistent with their makeup and SFX PERIOD What I will say against the film is its runtime PERIOD I think that conventional slashers shouldnt be much longer than  minutes as it is hard to maintain tension for that long PERIOD

Final Friday is the only film in the franchise that I hate PERIOD I think that while most films can at least fall back on their campy nature this one is a failure on every level PERIOD When you look at the poster for this movie youd think that this would be a goofy 90s flick but its depressingly incompetent PERIOD

This movie tries to take the evil incarnate route with Jason PERIOD What sets Jason apart from his contemporaries is that unlike Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger hes not a demon hes just a normal person PERIOD Sure Jasons a superpowered unkillable and insanely powerful guy but hes still a guy PERIOD In the earlier films hes bumbling and has weaknesses PERIOD The Final Friday pigeonholes him into being this great force of evil and it feels disconnected from the rest of the franchise PERIOD

If this movie was campy at least you could laugh at the Jason Worm but it takes itself too seriously which is seemingly impossible when the main antagonist is Jason as a worm PERIOD Overall its not worth it PERIOD

At this point there are  movies and even I have to admit that the series has done as much as they can PERIOD Naturally this film is a beautiful ending to the series where Jason returns to Crystal Lake and pays homage to the second film PERIOD Oh wait Im thinking of Part VI PERIOD No in Jason X he goes to space and becomes a cyborg PERIOD The film refuses to take itself seriously which at the tenth installment in a franchise well past its prime is a relief PERIOD Its not trying to be scary its not even trying to be good its just trying to have fun and I think it succeeds PERIOD

Freddy vs PERIOD Jason is a good time PERIOD I think that Ronny Yu was a great choice for director as he also directed the camptastic Bride of Chucky. was it worth the Final Friday which set up Freddy vs PERIOD Jason No absolutely not PERIOD

As for the remake I am split PERIOD It may be the last film we get but its such an underwhelming film to end on PERIOD Its not camp but its not atrocious like Final Friday was PERIOD At least that would be an ending PERIOD I think the fact that I am drawn to write about what it means for the franchise rather than the film itself shows that it is so very forgettable PERIOD

Friday the thirteenth fans have been starved for mainline movie content since Jason X was released over  years ago PERIOD While there have been many books comics video games and a television series to help fill the void well have to wait for the next Jason Lives if one ever comes at all PERIOD The movies arent for everyone but theyre usually full of elements of camp and sleaze with a side of substance PERIOD Theyre perfect for a horror movie night especially when Friday the thirteenth even falls in October this year PERIOD
