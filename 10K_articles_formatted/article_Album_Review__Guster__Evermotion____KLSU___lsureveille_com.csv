Moving at their own pace Guster dropped their seventh album Evermotion January   PERIOD The first four weeks following the release has given listeners time to digest their latest work and first release upon leaving a major label PERIOD The shift in attitude is evident as the label change has produced a much happier more buoyant sound PERIOD Bringing back many of the vibes found in earlier productions Evermotion is a collection of sweet songs and evocative lyrics PERIOD

Produced by Richard Swift who has also worked with The Shins Foxygen and Stereolab the album bulldozes inhibitions propelling the band to a hardercharging more freewheeling sound PERIOD Still clinging to its popy college rockrock ready acoustic guitar roots Evermotion is bolstered by new layers of sequencers synth pads and sweet harmonies PERIOD Its a refreshing uplift in sound from some of their previous work with tinkling xylophones in the first track Long Night and the bring back of bongos in Doin it by Myself and Never Coming Down PERIOD Theres even a herald to the 80s with a fun synth drum set in Simple Machine PERIOD The sound is undeniably more pop than Gusters earlier albums and makes for a good listen but a good second listen is required to digest the lyrics PERIOD

Gusters new tracks are pleasant enough and in comparison to past works are much happier sounding but there is still a lingering sense of melancholy that the band cant quite seem to shake PERIOD Several listens are needed to get the full effect of the messages in the buried within the tracks but they reach out to listeners in a very relatable way PERIOD Kid Dreams and It is What it is are reminiscent of those times everyone experiences as an awkward confused youth but come to realize shape the person you are today PERIOD Theres a note of bitter sweetness to these songs as the lyrics recognize a present happiness though it may have stemmed from less than ideal situations PERIOD Its a wrap up of the entire album as its clear that Guster has found some recent happiness or new burst of creative energy PERIOD Maybe its symbolic of their recent label depart or a nicely crated set of their time growing and experimenting through the years PERIOD Overall Evermotion is a delightful album thats worth a listen or at the very least a good hoorah for Gusters leap of faith and positive outcome PERIOD
