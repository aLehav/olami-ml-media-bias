The Coles County Fair takes place on the periphery for most Eastern students PERIOD



It exists as an event advertised on the radio or in the newspaper before students leave for home after the summer term PERIOD

But for Coles County natives it is an elemental part of the communitys lifeblood PERIOD

For some it is a part of their way of life PERIOD

A group of those individuals work yearround to organize and manage the fair PERIOD

They are the Coles County Fair Association and they have been putting on the fair in one form or another for  years PERIOD

At the end of July they will make it  years PERIOD

Each summer thousands of people from Coles County and beyond descend on a few acres of land in the county seat PERIOD

But the fair has not always stood on such solid ground PERIOD

In October of  the fair was hosted in former County Clerk Nathan Ellingtons pasture PERIOD

Charleston natives now know the pasture as Trojan Hill where the local high school plays its football games PERIOD

When the fair moved to its permanent location a tornado ripped through the western part of Charleston in  leaving the fair grounds and its modest but not inconsiderable structures in shambles PERIOD

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the tornado was rated an F4 on the Fujita scale which determines tornado strength based on the storms capacity to inflict damage on structures or vegetation PERIOD

Roughly  people died in the tornado and it resulted in  million dollars of property damage PERIOD

The Coles County Fair Associations Vice President Ron Brown said the fair almost ceased to exist in the 1960s PERIOD

The fair was in danger of foreclosure during the early 1960s with a debt of approximately  Brown said. they held what they thought was their last fair in . in early  a group of Charleston businessmen organized a fund drive to pay off the debt. brown said in two weeks they raised the money by selling  shares. following its near collapse the fair was reorganized and has been debt free ever since PERIOD

Now the fair serves as a permanent fixture in the life of the people in eastcentral Illinois PERIOD

It has been that place for Coles County Fair Association President Tom Jones PERIOD

The fair has been a part of his life for  years PERIOD

Every fair is a different experience Jones said PERIOD It does not matter where they are people always seem to come together at fair time. the fair is such an important part of his life that he his wife and newborn daughter came straight to the fair from the hospital PERIOD

One of my daughters was born the  of July and the first thing we did when we came home from the hospital was go to the Coles County Fair before we ever went home with her Jones said PERIOD

Jones  is a retired truck driver and native of Coles County. he works yearround to pull off the fair each summer PERIOD

Brown said despite the work of the association the project would never be a success with the work of only a small group of people PERIOD

For me it is the people that come back here every year he said PERIOD

In the spirit of such comradery and fellowship Brown said each year his wife and family come to his house and make  gallons of homemade ice cream for fair week. they have carried on the tradition for  years PERIOD

Brown Jones and the rest of the board work to put on the fair for a couple of key reasons one of which is the economic stimulus it provides PERIOD

Theyre buying meals and staying in hotels. it is just an influx of people into the community in one week where they patronize the local businesses Jones said PERIOD

He noted that in addition to serving as an economic boost the fair is also an educational opportunity. specifically it is a good way to teach the current generation of children about the role of agriculture in Midwestern society PERIOD

A lot of kids think their milk comes out of a gallon jug Jones said PERIOD

In the weeks leading up to the fair the board works to maintain the grounds PERIOD

We are working on the grounds which we take great pride in Jones said. we think our fair grounds are the nicest in the state of Illinois. members of the association rarely get an opportunity to relax once the fair gets underway PERIOD

They stay at the associations headquarters and take care of administrative matters as the fair progresses PERIOD

As soon as the fair concludes in early August they immediately turn around and prepare for the next year PERIOD

We get the fair over with on the fourth of August and were talking about next year on the fifth of August Jones said PERIOD

The entire event is hosted for  of which the board keeps none. the Coles County Fair Association is a nonprofit PERIOD

For the future Jones said they would love to have more money to spend on performers PERIOD

Currently the budget has  to  set aside for bringing in acts PERIOD

Jones said one of his goals is to bring in a big name to take the event to the next level PERIOD
