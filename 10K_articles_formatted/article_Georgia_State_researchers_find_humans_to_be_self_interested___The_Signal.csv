8812,2023-11-05,"humans do not resist being overcompensated according to Georgia State study The Neural Basis of Perceived Unfairness in Economic Exchange. the study was conducted by Georgia States Brain and Behavior Program researchers and  subjects played games involving three different ways to split  according to a Georgia State press release PERIOD

Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI was used to study participants inner brain activity according to the release PERIOD

fMRIs detect changes in flow and blood oxygenation which occur in response to neural activity according to PsychCentrals website PERIOD

The study revealed humans are less concerned about the outcomes of others according to the release PERIOD

Dr PERIOD Sarah Brosnan associate professor of psychology said in the release researchers believed people would protest during the fixed decision part of the game PERIOD

People protested higher offers at roughly the same rate that they refused offers where they got more indicating that this lack of refusal in advantaged situations may not be because of the cost of refusing she said PERIOD It may just be because people dont care as much as we thought they did if theyre getting more than someone else. murkesh Dhamala associate professor of the department of physics and astronomy said the researchers wanted to learn about the neural basis of protests and refusals PERIOD

We were curious whether there was an asymmetry in our behavioral and brain responses for favoring and disfavoring inequities and if so what this asymmetry looked like he said PERIOD

Out of the  subjects only one individual frequently rejected being overcompensated according to Dhamala PERIOD

The results of our research makes us aware of the fact that humans sense of fairness or perception of inequity is guided by selfinterest and there is a neurobiological basis for that he said PERIOD That means that we have to realize that it takes some work to correct our sense of unfairness as a society. the research was funded by a Brains and Behavior Program at Georgia State grant according to the release PERIOD

The Brains and Behavior program spans many disciplines and is a part of Georgia States Neuroscience Institute according to Georgia States Neuroscience Institute website PERIOD
