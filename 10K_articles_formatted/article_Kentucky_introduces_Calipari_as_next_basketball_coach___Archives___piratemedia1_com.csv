Updated November     pm



John Calipari cautioned the Kentucky faithful that he was not the  or   even if his eightyear . million contract as the Wildcats new coach pays him like one PERIOD

Before his introductory news conference Wednesday Kentuckys athletics board approved the contract that will make Calipari the highest paid coach in the nation PERIOD Athletic director Mitch Barnhart defended the salary saying that the university paid a premium price to leave Memphis and that Calipari 

 Calipari said PERIOD 

He might need to find a magic wand PERIOD Kentucky fired Billy Gillispie on Friday after two seasons where he went  including losing  games this season and failing to lead the Wildcats into the NCAA tournament PERIOD

 Calipari said PERIOD 

And Kentucky has demonstrated its willing to pay whatever it takes to get back to that level PERIOD

Caliparis decision to take the job didnt come easy PERIOD He spent more than a day mulling Kentuckys lucrative offer while reporters camped outside his home PERIOD

 Calipari said PERIOD 

Calipari had such strong ties to Memphis that after his UK introduction he was expected to fly back there for an afternoon news conference during which university officials were expected to discuss the future of their basketball program PERIOD

Calipari  knows what he is getting into at Kentucky PERIOD He said before he made his decision he reached out to several former Wildcats coaches PERIOD

This is pretty heady stuff for me.This was a dream Ive had since we brought our team down hereI believe it was  we UMass had won the Alaskan Shootout came down here to play and I could not believe the environment PERIOD At that point I said  I would love to coach there someday.I told Dr PERIOD Todd and Mitch if you want something to happen in a year do not hire meThats not how I do things.Our goals will be to make the entire commonwealth proud of this team proud of their program proud of their team by our work on the court and our integrity off the court he said PERIOD

Caliparis deal eclipses the . million average salary of Floridas Billy Donovan and dwarfs those of Caliparis predecessorsPitino Smith and Gillispie PERIOD

Pitino now the coach at rival Louisville never made more than  million a season during his remarkably successful eightyear run at Kentucky PERIOD Smiths compensation neared . million at the end of his decade with the program and Gillispie received a base salary of . million with another  available in incentives PERIOD

The salary nearly triples the . million salary of Kentucky football coach Rich Brooks a rarity in a conference where football reigns PERIOD

Calipari has a reputation as one of the nations best recruiters and its possible some of his latest recruits will follow him to Lexington PERIOD Still the cupboard is hardly bare at Kentucky PERIOD

The Wildcats went  this year missing the NCAA tournament for the first time since  despite having two of the SECs best players in guard Jodie Meeks and forward Patrick Patterson PERIOD

Patterson said after the season hed likely return for his junior year while Meeks  a secondteam AllAmerican  was going to take his time on a decision PERIOD

Hiring Calipari might be all the incentive they need PERIOD
