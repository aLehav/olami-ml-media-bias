After eight semesters in the running the Judaic Holocaust and Peace Studies film series was cut due to a mix up in the grant application said Rennie Brantz codirector of the Center for Judaic Holocaust and Peace Studies and Professor of History PERIOD

When we applied for the grant there was an error in the application process so it wasnt submitted properly Brantz said PERIOD

The Center of Judaic Holocaust and Peace Studies operates primarily by donations from private sponsors Brantz said PERIOD



The center usually shows eight films with the licensing fee costing  to  per film for the permission to present it to the public Brantz said PERIOD

Without the grant the center is unable to provide the  necessary for the series he said PERIOD

The center reapplied for the grant for the spring Brantz said and hopes to resume the series then PERIOD

Currently  students are minoring in Judaic Holocaust and Peace Studies PERIOD

Senior Selena Thompson JHP minor said she is greatly upset the series was canceled PERIOD



Sadly if you ask random students on campus how much they know about the Holocaust a majority would say that Hitler hated the Jews and put them in death camps Thompson said PERIOD There is much more to how the Nazis got away with the Holocaust. this film series could broaden students knowledge on the subject or at least get them interested in knowing more about what really happened Thompson said PERIOD

Senior Bryan Doppel also a JHP minor said it is a shame the film series is not being shown PERIOD

Some films are from that time period which helps us see how those situations were viewed at the time they were happening by people that were actually there said Doppel PERIOD Other films such as Schindlers List were made long after but are still able to depict the strong emotions and sentiments of these events. story KASI MITCHELL Intern News Reporter
