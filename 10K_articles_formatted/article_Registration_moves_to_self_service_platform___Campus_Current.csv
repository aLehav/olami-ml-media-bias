For fall students must use the Student Planning
Scheduling and Registration System on MyAACC PERIOD

Maggie Brown ReporterApril  

Students registering online for fall classes will have to use the selfservice Planning Scheduling and Registration tool on MyAACC because the college has discontinued the old Web Developer PERIOD

Director of Academic Advising Bonnie LasherKimmel said the old system only allowed students to search and register for courses PERIOD On the new system students can see requirements for their degrees and certificates PERIOD It also makes it easier for students to build their schedules and register for courses she said PERIOD

What we are finding is not only do students love the new system but it is really easy to use LasherKimmel said PERIOD

The new system has been available since May  and allows students to have everything regarding their degrees in one place so they dont have to visit multiple sites to find courses and class times register for classes or pay tuition PERIOD

Students can access the portal through MyAACC PERIOD

Anyone who has trouble can meet with an academic adviser or watch the video tutorials on the site PERIOD
