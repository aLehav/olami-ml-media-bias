The Appalachian State Mountaineers took a trip to the state capital Thursday night to take on the NC State Wolfpack PERIOD In their second ACC match this season the Mountaineers were unable to get anything going and fell to the Wolfpack  PERIOD

The beginning of the game seemed almost identical to the loss against Duke back in November PERIOD NC State  won the tip and took control of the game going on a  run compared to the Blue Devils  run PERIOD

The Mountaineers  struggled getting offensive rebounds early in the game but managed to land a handful of buckets early and cut the lead to  PERIOD

Sophomore guard Ronshad Shabazz lead the Mountaineers in scoring shooting sixfor19 with  points and junior guard Jake Babic followed close behind going threeforfive with  points PERIOD

The Mountaineers had no trouble getting looks and taking shots as they shot  total times and  times from 3point range PERIOD They outshot their opponents by a wide margin with the Wolfpack only shooting  total times and  times from the 3point range PERIOD The trouble they had were with the shots falling in their favor PERIOD

I thought we had tremendous opportunities to make shots shots we usually make and we just missed them today head coach Jim Fox said PERIOD

At halftime App State was twofor12 from 3point range while the Wolfpack were a perfect fourforfour PERIOD

When youre missing open shots over and over again it just wears on you throughout the game Fox said PERIOD

The Mountaineers certainly were getting worn down PERIOD In the first half alone NC State was  from the foul line PERIOD App only managed shooting fourforsix from the line PERIOD

Shooting wasnt the only issue in the game PERIOD App State turned the ball over  times which led to  points off turnovers throughout the game PERIOD When it came to rebounds the Mountaineers fought hard for the ball but overall were outrebounded  PERIOD

NC State had  fast breaks throughout the night and  points off the bench PERIOD

The little bit of light that did shine for the Mountaineers were the  second chance points they put up PERIOD

It wasnt hard to single out what the team needs to work on the most PERIOD

Rebounding as a team and defense all around period PERIOD Just defense Shabazz said PERIOD

Shabazz tallied his twenty-sixth doubledigit scoring game of his career and eighth of the season while Babic collected his ninth and third of the season Thursday night PERIOD

It shows us what we need to work on and we go back to the drawing board and we work Shabazz said PERIOD

The Mountaineers will return home this Saturday to face James Madison University at  p.m PERIOD at Holmes Convocation Center PERIOD
