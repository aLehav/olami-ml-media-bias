8899,2015-12-03,"situated off campus and arguably closer to Wallingford than the town of Swarthmore Mary Lyon is generally not the most popular of dormitories PERIOD However for firstyear students Ben Goloff and Andrew Karas Mary Lyon is a perfectly suitable place to live during their first year of college PERIOD

Before they moved in both students were aware of the closeknit community of people living in Mary Lyon PERIOD According to Goloff he was skeptical about the accuracy of the dormitorys reputation until he began engaging in its intimate hall life PERIOD Goloff and Karas have observed that people who have never experienced Mary Lyon residential life express pity to them about where they live PERIOD This pity appears unwarranted however as both Golof and Karas have established friendships with other firstyears in their dorm and even today they regularly eat dinner together as group at Sharples PERIOD Karas disputes the stereotype that Mary Lyon residents are comprised only of diehard scifi fans PERIOD Theres definitely a scifi fantasy contingent but were not really part of that Karas said PERIOD

As a violinist Goloffs biggest concern was the distance between the dorm and the practice rooms in the Lang Music Building PERIOD Now the students arrange their schedules intending to be on campus for most of the day PERIOD It makes for long days Goloff said PERIOD The distance doesnt deter either of the students from their involvement with activities and clubs they would be as involved regardless of dorm location PERIOD

Despite the impractical and timeconsuming aspect of the walk from the dorm to campus the students appreciate the distance PERIOD Goloff who is originally from New York City is accustomed to walking and enjoys living beyond a fiveminute radius from campus PERIOD Karas from the suburbs of Chicago recalled commuting to high school by car and that the only walking required of him was walking from his house to the car door and from the car door to the school entrance PERIOD Karas describes walking rather than riding in a car to classes as relaxing despite not having anticipated the uphill incline of the walk PERIOD

Living in Mary Lyon has exclusive perks most notably the weekend meals served in the ML Breakfast Room PERIOD Before his arrival Karas was under the assumption that breakfast would be served daily at his dormitory so he was invariably disappointed by the reality PERIOD Nonetheless he enjoys ordering blueberry pancakes and is satisfied that it is no worse than the food served at Sharples PERIOD Goloff too would prefer breakfast to be extended to weekdays but waits in anticipation for certain specialty items which rotate every few weeks such as lemon blueberry upsidedown cake and popovers PERIOD

Because freshmen roommate pairings are designated by the administration firstyear roommates are not always compatible PERIOD Fortunately Goloff and Karas describe each other as a great roommate pairing as well as friends PERIOD Were similar in a lot of odd ways but were pretty different Goloff said PERIOD Goloff admits Karas being the neater of the duo keeps him in check with maintaining orderliness on his side of the room PERIOD As for sleeping Goloff recalled humorous incidents when Karas a heavy sleeper has slept through a half hour of alarms going off PERIOD

The decorative features of the room highlight each of the students distinct interests PERIOD Ornithology appeals to Goloff a budding environmental studies and biology major PERIOD On his side of the room hang several posters of exotic birds such as the Yellowbreasted Chat PERIOD His sliding desk keyboard tray stores a miniature keyboard that he uses to complete his music theory homework PERIOD

Karas is interested in cities and their contingent aspects such as government transportation and urban planning PERIOD As part of an independent study he conducted last year on urban transportation he looked into transit challenges where people attempt to navigate all stations in subway systems such as the New York City Subway in the shortest time possible PERIOD People get obsessed with it PERIOD It takes like  hours he said PERIOD Karas along with two friends was one of the first enthusiasts to undertake the challenge in Chicago completing it in nine hours and  minutes PERIOD Only one person preceded their efforts narrowly beating them with a time of nine hours and  minutes PERIOD Karas was acknowledged for his work by the Chicago Transit Authority which gifted him a personalized transit sign that prominently sits on his bookshelf PERIOD His story was covered by local papers and even NBC which featured him on a  second news clip according to Karas PERIOD

Evidence of Orientation Week remains in Goloffs and Karas room distinguishing their room as that belonging to firstyears PERIOD Colorful welcome cards handmade by their CA leader remain pinned on their front door PERIOD On the windowsill sit potted plants distributed to firstyears by the Scott Arboretum earlier last semester PERIOD Our plants are still living which is surprising Goloff said as the students left the plants untended over winter break PERIOD

Karas holds quibbles about the facilities in Mary Lyon such as the shower in the students shared bathroom which runs cold in the mornings and would prefer to live elsewhere in upcoming years PERIOD But for him being placed into the dormitory as a first year has resulted in great friendships PERIOD

Its good for me to have lived here at least once during my four years he said PERIOD

Nota bene At Swarthmores Mary Lyon we DEFINE ourselves as not the most popular dorm Ben Goloff may be pleased to know that once icy morn I ran into an ML pal hiking to music class on campus PERIOD What you headed to  listen to Cages . i told him to go back to bed PERIOD ML students look out for each other PERIOD
