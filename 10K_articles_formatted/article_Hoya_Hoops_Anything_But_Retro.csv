Wednesday night will mark the first time this season that the Georgetown mens basketball team will participate in a nationally televised contest PERIOD
In past years such an event was no cause for commotion PERIOD But in  with no games slated for a national audience at the seasons getgo Hoya fans should be elated by this stroke of good fortune PERIOD
ESPN has come up with a new gimmick to market college basketball games and Georgetown is a beneficiary of this development PERIOD A new special called Turn Back the Clock is currently airing on ESPN Classic  a network that typically airs only historically significant games and documentaries  since December PERIOD
The Hoyas are slated to have two of their remaining contests  including tomorrows  p.m PERIOD tipoff with Seton Hall  broadcast on this network complete with oldschool announcers retro graphics and whatever actions of fans and players will convince viewers that Carter is still in the White House PERIOD
While this coverage might not suffice for those supporters of Georgetown mens basketball who have been clamoring for more recognition it will undoubtedly give John Thompson III and his players more of the credit they deserve PERIOD
Ad
Apparently the media has finally come to acknowledge our teams success PERIOD
ESPN analyst Dick Vitale wrote a column last Monday about this seasons rookie head coaches who have done particularly well in their first year on the job PERIOD Vitale purported that Thompson sits at the top of that class PERIOD That same day at halftime during a matchup of Big East foes Syracuse and Rutgers the talk wasnt about the Big Easts currently ranked teams like UConn Pitt and BC PERIOD It was all about Hoya paranoia with Georgetown and top  being mentioned in the same breath PERIOD
The only thing left for our young team to earn is the support of its fans  support that would best be displayed in the form of a loud and proud home crowd that can provide a true homecourt advantage PERIOD Theres no reason for the MCI Center to be as loud when Chris Thomas or Luther Head sinks a trey as when Roy Hibbert takes it to the house PERIOD
While two of Georgetowns biggest yettobeplayed matchups are on the road at UConn and Notre Dame Villanova does come to town Feb PERIOD  for what is sure to be a pivotal contest in terms of conference tournament seeding and bragging rights especially after the Hoyas spoiled the Wildcats celebration of their 20year NCAA championship anniversary with a  win at Villanova Jan PERIOD  PERIOD
As for tomorrows game  sure its only Seton Hall a team with a  conference record PERIOD But we have to take what we can get PERIOD And when the number of nationally televised games on our teams schedule has dwindled from  in  to eight to three to none this development should be about as exciting as learning that benchwarmer Tyler Crawford can actually put up some points when given the chance PERIOD
Get out to this game PERIOD And the next one PERIOD And the one after that PERIOD And if youre still on the fence about spring break plans just pocket the couple grand you would have blown in Cancun or Jamaica and pick up a cheap roundtrip ticket to New York for Mar PERIOD  PERIOD The Hoyas have the potential to make lots of noise in the conference tourney at Madison Square Garden and theres no reason for their fans not to be there to help get them started PERIOD
Sports purists might be up in arms over what ESPN is trying to do construing the ESPN Classic broadcasts as yet another overcommercialization of the game PERIOD And your roommates might think that going to MCI Center decked in 70s garb is lame PERIOD Do it anyway PERIOD
Its a step closer to national prominence for Georgetown basketball PERIOD Its an opportunity to get potential recruits to pay attention to us PERIOD And if I could have my way itd be an occasion for Jeff Green to ditch the dreads and bust out an awesome afro PERIOD
So long as his moms there to enjoy the spectacle PERIOD
