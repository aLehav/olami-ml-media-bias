Gireesh Gupchup has been approved by the SIU Board of Trustees for the position ofvice president for academic innovation planning and partnerships PERIOD Gupchup a pharmacy professor and the director of UniversityCommunity Initiatives at SIUE also previously served as the dean of the SIUE School of Pharmacy PERIOD

The Board of Trustees approved Gireesh Gupchup former dean of the SIUE School of Pharmacy as the new system vice president at their meeting last week PERIOD



Gupchup said the position caught his interest not only because he had experience with academic affairs planning and community partnerships but also because of his experience in the School of Pharmacy as dean from  to  PERIOD Prior to becoming dean Gupchup had served as the schools first associate dean after it was founded in  PERIOD



I thought back to when I came here to SIUE to start the pharmacy school and at that time the entire system came together to help to make the pharmacy school successful Gupchup said PERIOD SIUE helped a great deal the system helped with the legislative issues and we got a lot of help from Carbondale with courses PERIOD We were able to look at courses at Carbondale where students could take a prepharmacy curriculum there PERIOD So the entire system came together to help and that has always stuck with me that the system has the capability to collaborate. gupchup said his plans for the future in regard to his new position include sharing more information with Academic Affairs and between campusesBy doing so Gupchup hopes to help bring back this sense of collaboration and work toward a systemless vision for SIUE and SIUC PERIOD



If all the campuses can come together and find a common why thats really what we call systemness PERIOD You find those commonalities and then you can implement those and the common why in different ways on different campuses Gupchup said PERIOD Because were different campuses and thats the strength of a system but coming together on the common why youre going to get a much stronger solution. according to Gupchup some of the jobs first challenges will be building trust relationships and teams so faculty and staff across campuses can come together to create better solutions and focus on systemwide collaboration PERIOD



Theres a book called Good to Great by Jim Collins and he talks about how organizations move from good to great PERIOD So thats going to be my challenge Gupchup said PERIOD How do we build trust and get as Jim Collinss example goes how do you get the right people on the bus in the right seats so youre going in the right direction with the correct team



SIU System President Dan Mahony said he is excited to work closely with Gupchup because he can offer a different perspective coming from a pharmacy background compared to Mahonys background as president of Winthrop University and dean of the College of Education Health and Human Services at Kent State University before coming to the SIU system PERIOD



I think hes a very very innovative man PERIOD I think he will bring a lot to that position and hell see things because he comes from a different background being in pharmacy as opposed to my background Mahony said PERIOD He will probably see some opportunities that maybe I wont see so hell be really adding to our team. jim Allen who served as the interim system vice president prior to Gupchups approval led the search committee to select the new vice president PERIOD Allen said Gupchups interview was another factor that made him stand out PERIOD During the interview he shared ideas for developing a systemwide strategic plan PERIOD



He is a charming expansive enthusiastic thoughtful person when you talk with him .. PERIOD His interview style also struck people particularly strong  not style but substance of what he had to say what ideas he brought to the interview PERIOD He really was firstrate I have to confess Allen said PERIOD
