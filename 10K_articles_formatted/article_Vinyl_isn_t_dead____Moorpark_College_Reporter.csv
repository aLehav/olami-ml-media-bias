These days iTunes and Spotify are the top music websites making physical music and record stores almost obsolete PERIOD

On one special day out of the year the third Saturday of April musicsavvy listeners celebrate Record Store Day with limited edition releases and exclusive shows PERIOD

One of my favorite days of the year where the ambiance is a little different and the shared interests of record lovers infiltrates the air of independent record stores PERIOD

Starting in  Record Store Day was a way for independently owned record storeowners to celebrate the uniqueness of record store culture according to recordstoreday.com PERIOD

The game of the day for me is to find my favorite bands limited edition Record Store Day vinyl to add to my collection PERIOD

Before the formation of this special day vinyl records were on the brink of extinction but according to billboard.com Record Store Day spun vinyl records back PERIOD

With the help of Record Store Day vinyl sales grew  percent that year with the largest singleyear unit gain until  according to the article The true story of how vinyl spun its way back from nearextinction by Glen Peoples published on billboard.com PERIOD

Although Record Store Day does spikeup business Alexa Posner an employee at Record Outlet in Thousand Oaks says records are something to be celebrated all the time not just on that one day PERIOD

We always find the time to celebrate records on a daily basis but it definitely is a busier business day on Record Store Day Posner said PERIOD

A lot of preparation goes into Record Store Day and Record Outlet is on top of their game for this coming Black Friday Record Store Day PERIOD

We are going to try to make sure we are well stocked and just provide the best records that we can we try to do that every single day said Posner PERIOD Its Record Store Day everyday here. although Record Store Day is usually held on every third Saturday of April this year there is a special Black Friday Record Store Day PERIOD

Black Friday Record Store Day is something the official Record Store Day is presenting this year with independent stores that choose to participate in distributing the limited edition releases PERIOD

The celebratory spin on the turntable is one I urge for after finding the records Im hoping to collect this Record Store Day PERIOD

Some notable local record stores who will participating on that day are Record Outlet in Thousand Oaks Salzers in Ventura and Amoeba Music in Los Angeles PERIOD A full list can be found at the the official Record Store Day website recordstoreday.com PERIOD
