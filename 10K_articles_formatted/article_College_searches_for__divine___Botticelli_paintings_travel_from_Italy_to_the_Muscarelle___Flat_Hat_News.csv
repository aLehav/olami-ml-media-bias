For our constituents for our visitors it will be a once in a lifetime opportunity to see these works in the flesh so thats significant Head of Collections and Exhibitions Management Melissa Parris said PERIOD Its an artist whos among the most important artists in our history PERIOD We of course have a fine art history and studio program here so that is good for students to be able to see master works firsthand. through a partnership with Italys Associazione Culturale Metamorfosi the Muscarelle was loaned the Turin gallerys Venus painting along with  of Botticellis other works from cities and churches in Italy according to a press release PERIOD

Titled Botticelli and the Search for the Divine Florentine Painting Between the Medici and the Bonfires of the Vanities the exhibits next and only other American host will be Bostons Museum of Fine Arts starting April  PERIOD

The transport of valuable 500yearold works presents its own set of challenges for the museum PERIOD Parris said that securing the collections transport involved a very complicated set of logistics that was challenging because it required working with different fine arts agents in Italy PERIOD

Once the shipping is settled and the works arrive at the museum Muscarelle staff must ensure that the works fit in the galleries despite prior preparation PERIOD

Theres a lot of discussion about layout which our curator usually has prepared in advance Parris said PERIOD But then sometimes objects will come and we may find we have to slightly adjust some of our earlier expectations because of the challenges with the installation. logistical concerns such as art pieces fitting within the layout are not the only issues that the museum must address come installation PERIOD Lenders make requests that the host institution must fulfill during the process such as installing protective guard rails to presenting the art in a way that conveys its natural condition PERIOD

The Muscarelles Assistant Director and Chief Curator John Spike works with Facilities and Exhibitions Manager Kevin Gilliam to ensure that these requests are met PERIOD One work Botticellis Saint Augustine in the Studio came with its own specific design requests PERIOD

Everything has to be thought through and we have to respond to our lenders request Spike said PERIOD

After years of effort planning and negotiation that went into this exhibit Muscarelle Director and CEO Aaron De Groft said that he believes that the exhibit will afford visitors a rare opportunity to see Botticellis work inperson PERIOD

Theres no replacing seeing a work of art in person De Groft said PERIOD

Theres no replacing seeing a work of art in person De Groft said PERIOD The enormity the proportion to your body These are stunning examples of Botticelli that are being shared with our students and visitors that they never in their life would probably be able to see. botticelli is also wellknown for his works Birth of Venus and Primavera both of which reside in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence PERIOD

Spike and De Groft said they were unable to get these two works from the Uffizi Gallery therefore they will not be included in the Muscarelles exhibition PERIOD

Spike said that he still believes that the importance of Botticellis other works should not be underestimated PERIOD

He said that visitors to the Muscarelle who may not have the opportunity to travel to galleries overseas will appreciate what the museum has curated for exhibit PERIOD

Those audiences will be enthusiastic and grateful to see original works by him even though they are not those two unique treasures Spike said PERIOD At this point because of his fame all of his works are considered treasures. spike said that out of many of Botticellis paintings the singular Venus painting is valued because of the realness featured in the art PERIOD

The thing that makes his Venuses eternal in their appeal they never go out of style Its not only Vogue magazinelike elegance and refinement Spike said PERIOD There is a  naturalness in the womens face to remind us of real life. the works of the Venus painter are not the only works of art that the Muscarelle Museum will unveil upon the exhibits opening however PERIOD

The works of Filippo Lippi Botticellis master and pupil of the first Italian Renaissance painter Masaccio will also be on display in the museum PERIOD

We have more paintings by Filippo Lippi than have ever been shown apart from the Uffizi Gallery itself Spike said PERIOD

De Groft said that he believes that the strength of the exhibition lies in the research contributed by Spike which he called groundbreaking. one of the things that may be overlooked is that to discover things right make new observations about one of the great artists one of the most studied artists in art history is very difficult to do De Groft said PERIOD For a great liberal arts research university as highly ranked as William and Mary to provide cuttingedge new scholarship on something this studied this important is really I think very very important PERIOD And weve done that. save my name email and website in this browser for the next time I comment PERIOD
