Its clear that Hollywood has no shortage of endoftheworld blockbusters PERIOD While most doomsday scenarios seem more concerned with the fire and brimstone side of things Lorene Scafarias Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist forthcoming feature film Seeking a Friend for the End of the World boils it down to the most basic necessity human connection PERIOD

Starring Steve Carell and Keira Knightley the films protagonist Dodge finds himself at an existential crossroads PERIOD In a moment of panic his wife leaves him just as they  and the rest of the world  learn that an asteroid heading toward earth is expected to bring them all to their untimely conclusion PERIOD Despite the undeniably bleak subject matter Scafarias film is unusually lighthearted without being insensitive or flatout unbelievable PERIOD If anything its more of a black romantic comedy than an end of days showdown PERIOD

It was definitely less of a reaction about end of the world movies and more of a response to what romantic comedies have kind of become PERIOD I love them and I love watching people fall in love but I felt like I havent related to them much lately Scafaria said PERIOD

Alone and expectedly frightened Dodge decides hell reach out to a high school sweetheart before his last hurrah PERIOD But after a riot erupts near his home he flees with his British neighbor Penny accompanying him PERIOD It was a creative decision Scafaria decided on after interviewing various people about how theyd act if they were put in a similar situation PERIOD

When I did a lot of human research and asking people what they would do their needs were very basic PERIOD It was very much like being with friends and family Scafaria said PERIOD

I asked a relative and he said that he would find his high school sweetheart PERIOD Some people said they would go to work the next morning because they wouldnt know what else to do with themselves and other people obviously wouldnt ever go to work again. there might be an asteroid at the center of it all but there arent any elements of sciencefiction in the film PERIOD Its clear that Dodge feels like life has passed him by but its with Pennys help that he breaks out of his shell PERIOD

For a guy whos kind of been half dead and sleepwalking through life this could be one of the best things thats ever happened to him Scafaria said PERIOD So I wanted to take the future away from him hes obviously going to chase the past but whose going to pull him out of that

Scafaria said she had the idea floating around for a while but the script became more personal following the passing of her father PERIOD

I think thats when things really started to take shape because I had a brand new perspective on everything PERIOD So that had a big impact on the story Scafaria said PERIOD

Seeking a Friend for the End of the World doesnt attempt to answer any huge questions despite the grandiose context PERIOD There are moments where the dialogue falls flat and Carells performance is unconvincing but it takes a deft hand to find some humor in a story where the stakes couldnt be higher while still maintaining some sense of realism PERIOD
