Gannon University hosted its inaugural Student Safety Expo Tuesday afternoon to raise awareness and create a safer living and learning environment for student staff and faculty PERIOD

The event held in the Yehl Ballrooom was sponsored by S.A.V.E PERIOD and Gannon University Police and Safety PERIOD S.A.V.E stands for Students Against Violence Everywhere and is an oncampus Gannon organization that aims to educate students faculty and staff about interpersonal violence on campus PERIOD

Dan Gennaro a community outreach assistant for the Crime Victim Center of Erie County and S.A.V.E PERIOD assistant worked with Katie Allison violence preventioneducation coordinator with S.A.V.E. to create the event PERIOD

We really saw a need for this type of event Gennaro said PERIOD We knew that there was a Wellness Expo and a Service Expo but there wasnt anything to educate students about their own personal safety. gennaro said that the student attendance was lower than expected PERIOD Our biggest struggle is getting students to attend this event he said. a lot of the different causes we advocate for are touchy taboo subjects that most people dont want to seek help for. gennaro said about  to  vendors were invited to participate and they had an excellent turnout with  actually attending the expo PERIOD

Vendors at the expo included Pennsylvania State Troopers District Attorneys Office Erie County Department of Health and SafeNet of Erie PERIOD

Rachel Andrews an outreach advocate and training host for SafeNet of Erie said that she was glad they could be a part of the expo PERIOD

Our main focus here is on dating violence and healthy relationships Andrews said PERIOD We also want them to understand what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like PERIOD With todays media sending such mixed messages on what is appropriate in a relationship I think this is really something all young people should know PERIOD

There havent been many students here today Andrews added PERIOD But even if we can help just three students notice the early warning signs of abusive relationships this will have all been worth it. senior prephysical therapy student Ashley Wyrick is the president of Active Minds a mental health awareness organization on campus PERIOD

Active Minds works closely with the counseling center on Gannons campus to raise awareness of various mental health issues and to defeat the social stigma that comes along with having one PERIOD

So many people are too afraid to even associate with people who have a mental illness Wyrick said PERIOD Active Minds aims to create a sort of equal grounds between students here at Gannon. this fall Active Minds will be conducting Post Secret a program where students can write down an anonymous confession on a PostIt note which will then be hung around campus PERIOD Students are encouraged to write down comments on others confessions PERIOD

Gennaro said he is excited to see where the expo will go in the future PERIOD

This expo is definitely something that we will be putting on for years to come he said PERIOD This is something that the whole community can benefit from PERIOD This years expo is everything we could have hoped for. sAMANTHA GRISWOLD
