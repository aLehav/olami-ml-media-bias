By  Ian TancunNovember  

Further education and increased awareness on sexual assault and language that promotes it is needed to end this unacceptable and illegal behavior many individuals continue to be victims of PERIOD

In  Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump spoke to former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush about his interactions with women and how his position of power enabled him to kiss and grab women by the genitals both without their consent according to an Oct  PERIOD video released by the Washington Post PERIOD

The legal definition of sexual assault is any nonconsensual sexual contact or behavior that occurs in any situation according to the U.S PERIOD Department of Justices website PERIOD

Trump explained his words were just locker room banter in his initial statement following the videos release as if that somehow made his comments acceptable PERIOD From his initial response to his continued defiance it is clear he does not grasp the severity of his comments PERIOD

Karen Baker associate vice president and Title IX coordinator for Affirmative Action and Equity Compliance said she found Trumps comments to be horrific PERIOD

Someone of his stature should have enough respect for a human being to simply ask for consent instead of using his power to say I can do whatever I want Baker said PERIOD

She said continued education is needed so college students understand consent must be freely given for each act and can never be assumed PERIOD

Im not sure what locker rooms Trump frequents where this type of language is viewed as acceptable PERIOD The language he used and the actions he described are never acceptable in any environment PERIOD But his comments shined a light on what continues to be a very serious problem individuals particularly women face nationwide PERIOD

In the United States a person experiences sexual assault about every  seconds according to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Networks website PERIOD Collegeage women  to  are three times more likely to be the victims of sexual assault according to the website PERIOD

These figures are disturbing PERIOD Equally disturbing is that Trumps comments advocated this behavior PERIOD Its unfathomable that any person particularly the candidate for the Republican Party who hopes to be elected as our next president would not only make such statements but continue to brush them off as typical talk between men PERIOD

Baker points out NIU has devoted its resources to create a comprehensive program across the university to educate students about sexual assault NIUs policies and the resources available to students who are victims of sexual assault PERIOD

This is a campus that hasnt taken sexual assault lightly Baker said PERIOD Everything we have done has been a partnership across campus this is not just one office that is taking care of this. domestic violence against women offenses at NIUs DeKalb campus dropped from  reported cases in  to three in  according to NIUs  Annual Safety and Security Report PERIOD

However dating violence against women offenses rose from four reported cases on campus in  to  in  while  rape cases were reported on campus in  according to the report PERIOD

Any student or individual who has been subjected to a form of sexual misconduct whether that be sexual assault or sexual harassment should come forward as soon as they are able to do so and report these incidents said Sarah Adamski associate director of Investigations and deputy Title IX coordinator for Affirmative Action and Equity Compliance PERIOD The more we report these incidents the more were able to address the issue at its core. trumps frequent comments degrading women and his comments describing how he sexually assaults them are revolting PERIOD What Trump fails to realize is words matter PERIOD

Sexual assault should not be taken lightly or joked about as Trump and Bush did on the Access Hollywood video PERIOD This is an issue that needs to be eradicated PERIOD That can only be done by continued education by understanding consent is required every single time for every single act and by treating others with the same respect as human beings that we would expect in return PERIOD

Confidential advising is available to students who may have experienced sexual assault PERIOD Please contact Counseling and Consultation Services at  to speak with a counselor PERIOD
