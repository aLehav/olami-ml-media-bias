Talk is cheap and everyones got some PERIOD Whether it be the fans and their oozing optimism in August the media and their fluctuating attitude over the season or this Illini team and their neverending stream of company lines theres been a lot of talk this year.Talk is cheap and everyones got some PERIOD

Whether it be the fans and their oozing optimism in August the media and their fluctuating attitude over the season or this Illini team and their neverending stream of company lines theres been a lot of talk this year PERIOD

But when the Illini   visit Ryan Field on Saturday to take on Northwestern   no amount of talk can help save their season PERIOD In order to reach a sixth win and give themselves a slim chance at a bowl berth Illinois is going to have to go out there and act PERIOD No more company lines PERIOD

Theres just one problem On a team thats actions dont match its potential Im afraid the Illini are nothing more than talkers PERIOD

Fool me once



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

Northwesterns offense is similar to what Minnesota runs  something the Illini have been beaten by this season PERIOD

Theyre a team that runs the quarterback an awful lot PERIOD They use him a lot like a running back senior defensive lineman Will Davis said of the Wildcats PERIOD They wont use the pass to kill you but theyll spread you out and then run the ball PERIOD

Everything that Northwestern has shown is something that weve already seen PERIOD Our offense runs a spread offense so its nothing that we havent seen. head coach Ron Zook and linebacker Brit Miller echoed similar remarks PERIOD

There was a couple plays we make sure we see every week now because Minnesota scored on one Miller said PERIOD Im sure well see the plays that beat us against Minnesota. well if the defense knows whats coming they shouldnt have any problem making the correct adjustments right

Every Monday the team talks about making adjustments from the last game that will lead into the next one but so far the results have been mixed PERIOD Nowhere is this more evident than by looking at Illinois inconsistent weektoweek play PERIOD

Its time for them to prove theyre learning from the past and making the proper adjustments instead of just talking about it PERIOD If Northwestern is something theyve seen before then this shouldnt be a problem 

Offensive execution

Much of the ire of the fans has been directed at Juice Williams and his turnoverhappy play PERIOD At the beginning of the season I would have told people to back off and give the guy a break but hes thrown more interceptions  than touchdowns  over the last four games PERIOD He deserves it PERIOD

Coach Locksley does a great job of putting us in the right position to go out there and score points and put up yards Williams said PERIOD Its up to us to go out there on the field and execute his plays PERIOD He cant come out there and do it for us. as much as the imagery of Locksley lining up under center makes me giggle Williams needs to execute better  especially in the passing game PERIOD

Too many times Juice stares down his primary receiver and gets picked off PERIOD Too many costly turnovers at crucial moments have killed drives PERIOD Theres a lot of talk about his ability but lets see him put it together when it matters most PERIOD

Zook the salesman

You got to be a pretty smooth talker to bring big name recruits to a program thats been in and out mostly in of the Big Ten basement PERIOD Coach Zook has proven to be one of the smoothest PERIOD

While hes been able to grab some highcaliber talent over a fairly short amount of time Zook and his staff need to get maximum utilization out of those players PERIOD Smooth talk is over PERIOD Its time for chalk talk PERIOD

Im not a supporter of firing Zook like some have become over the past two weeks but he does need to start working on his schemes PERIOD Recruiting will only get you so far PERIOD

Word of mouth

On a positive note Brit Miller is having a monster season PERIOD Ive mentioned this a few times but he is making J Lemans performance last year look like a stat line for a second stringer PERIOD Yet I feel like the fans only give Miller half the recognition PERIOD

As a member of the media I got to see a side of Miller most people didnt PERIOD He was always talkative and open PERIOD In fact he talked so much at times that we sometimes tried to avoid him PERIOD However even Miller was not immune to the teams constraints PERIOD

You wish you could say more Miller said PERIOD You wish you could get a little more personable PERIOD I try to break that barrier as much as possible. i know this column is being critical of this team talking too much but its a shame to hear from a player that hes being held back by his own team PERIOD We want to get to know our athletes PERIOD But there just seems to be too much in the way to make that possible PERIOD

For a team that says our time in unison after every practice this weekend is the moment to prove it PERIOD

My pessimism has led me to believe the Illini wont make it to a bowl game even if they do win in Evanston but realistically theres still a chance PERIOD

Personally Id rather be talking about going out on a positive note PERIOD But thats just me PERIOD
