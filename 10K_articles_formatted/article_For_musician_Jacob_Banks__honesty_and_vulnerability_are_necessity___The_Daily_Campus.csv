8285,2023-10-25,"in the narrow backstage room of Dallas Granada Theater a TV paused on the video game Grand Theft Auto is balanced on a sofa PERIOD Musician Jacob Banks plays video games before he goes on stage PERIOD He fills most of the waiting periods that constellate touring with video games PERIOD

Actually most of my songs I write when I play video games PERIOD Its one of my favorite things to do to pass time because touring you spend a lot of time waiting PERIOD You get to the venue at  a.m PERIOD Youre waiting til sound check at four PERIOD You sound check your way to perform at nine Banks says PERIOD Theres lots of gaps that need to be filled and we all like playing video games. video games are an unexpected catalyst for song writing PERIOD Hailing from Birmingham UK Jacob Banks did not set out to pursue a career in music PERIOD He has a degree in civil engineering PERIOD At age  when Banks best friend died abroad Banks changed trajectory PERIOD His career was forged from a crucible of grief and desire to make the best of life PERIOD

Banks writes poetic songs about his personal experiences and what it means to have a marginalized identity PERIOD One such song that explores the experience of marginalized people is Love Aint Enough. love Aint Enough sounds like its boymeetsgirl and the boy feels as though his love is not enough for girl Banks says PERIOD But what it actually talks about is like in the lyrics I use lots of connotations from slavery and the elegy of the song is I feel as thoughat the time anyway and I guess still nowanything the minority do the oppressed do it never seems to be enough to be made to feel as though youre equal. there doesnt seem to be any way for us to win Banks says PERIOD And that goes for black people for women for Muslimswhatever form the oppressed takes PERIOD It always feels like a loselose PERIOD Its one of the only places I feel like love by itself even when you show love when you show respect it never seems to cross the threshold. anything the minority do the oppressed do it never seems to be enough

But bold honesty is often met with criticism PERIOD Banks takes criticism in stride PERIOD He says its hard but its a punch you have to take in order to fight the good fight. at the beginning bringing honesty and vulnerability to his songs and on stage was difficult PERIOD But now its necessity for me PERIOD Like my job that I try to do is to keep people company PERIOD And I believe to do that I have to be honest with myself Banks says PERIOD

My job that I try to do is to keep people company. banks has found liberation in writing and performing music PERIOD

This is a massive escape for me to be free PERIOD And for me to enjoy a process I have to really say how I feel just so I can move past whats holding me back or whatever it is Banks says PERIOD Once I put pen to paper whatever it is I feel like Ive let it go. once I put pen to paper whatever it is I feel like Ive let it go. i think vulnerability is always hard but again its hard conceptually Banks says PERIOD But I understand the necessity of it so it makes it easier PERIOD I understand the job Im doing is necessary. banks hopes his songs chip away at toxic masculinity and the dehumanization of marginalized people PERIOD

As a black man I feel the need to convey my emotions eloquently and be okay in seeming human PERIOD I have to be okay with that PERIOD So its a doubleedged sword Banks says PERIOD

Banks has found a similarly liberating love for the people he works with PERIOD He has been touring for two years and he has not felt homesickness PERIOD

I feel at home PERIOD Anywhere in the world I feel at home Banks says PERIOD I think home is where the love is PERIOD I dont think home is a building. wherever my people are Im home. if his job is to keep people company his purpose is to let people know they are not alone in their pain PERIOD He says he gets it that hes been there PERIOD Banks believes the premise of music is to let people know theyre not alone PERIOD

I think thats what music tries to do PERIOD It doesnt have the answers PERIOD It just has to let people know youre not the only one Banks says PERIOD



Pain is so synonymous PERIOD It doesnt pick sides PERIOD Its very fair to everyone PERIOD Everyone gets their share amount at some point throughout life Banks says PERIOD

Even if you were to live a life free of pain Banks says at one point you will die and death itself is absolute. and you will cause heartache to somebody because youre no longer on this planet Banks says PERIOD So pain is going to come and music just lets people know Yo youre not alone PERIOD I know what it feels like to go through this to go through that. and you can either have nostalgia in love or company in pain. the Independent Voice of Southern Methodist University Since","For musician Jacob Banks, honesty and vulnerability are necessity â€“ The Daily Campus",Southern Methodist University
