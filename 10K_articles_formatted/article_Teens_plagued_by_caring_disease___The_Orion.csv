A person wakes up at  a.m PERIOD from a buzzing on their phone PERIOD Three text messages two missed calls and one voicemail that all happen to be from the same person PERIOD Feelings of irritation rush over because they are tired of people always checking up on them PERIOD

Society has created a stigma around the idea of caring too much about anyone PERIOD Its assumed that if someone wants to get anywhere in life they must be cut off from their emotions and become a selfish person PERIOD

Everyone thinks that catching feelings for someone can disrupt the goals they are striving so hard to complete PERIOD

Well it isnt PERIOD Showing someone how much love you have for them is never a bad habit PERIOD Do they like flowers Go buy a dozen PERIOD Good morning texts Send them PERIOD

Insecurities are fabricated by the notion that caring is an omen PERIOD Everyone thinks too hard about sending that second text or overthinking every action the other person takes PERIOD

Being straightforward about the feelings that are there can make everything simple because dancing around the subject never accomplishes anything PERIOD

Appearing needy is not what others want to be perceived as by their love interest PERIOD The most desired characteristic is independence PERIOD

That should not be confused with not caring because being independent means one can do daily tasks without having someone there to coach them through everything PERIOD

Tenderness is seen as a weakness when it should be viewed as a strength PERIOD There is strength in being able to pick yourself up after the pieces have shattered and learning how to care for another human being again PERIOD

Teenagers play this game where they see who can care less PERIOD They see having no emotions for someone as a good character trait when in actuality they should be pouring their souls into one another PERIOD

It has warped them into believing that relationships are distant and cold when they are rich and fulfilling PERIOD Caring about someone so much can enable one to learn something new every day PERIOD

Becoming emotionally invested in someone is not bad PERIOD By avoiding feelings society is missing out on the deep connections they can make with one another PERIOD

These connections are the ones that keep life moving forward and make it interesting PERIOD

So send The One that second text because who knows what kind of impact it can make on the relationship PERIOD
