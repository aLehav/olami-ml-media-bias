Yet another wild unpredictable NCAA tournament has produced a Final Four that very few peoplecan claim they predicted PERIOD Now if you are a neutral observer with no strong interest in any of the remaining contenders youre probably wondering who youshould root for PERIOD

With each of the four teams bringing fascinating subplots with them to Houston here is the rundown of the teams you should root for in the Final Four PERIOD

North Carolina The Tar Heels have steamrolled to their 19thFinal Four appearance by winning all four tournament games so far by at least  points PERIOD Outside of a few minutes against Notre Dame North Carolina has not been challenged much at all PERIOD It does not help opposing players that North Carolina is significantly more physically imposing than almost every other team in the nation PERIOD

The Tar Heels do not rely on a single star but rathera revolving door of talented athletes who can take over a game when called upon PERIOD How you defend versatile players like Marcus Paige Justin Jackson Brice Johnson and Joel Berry is a strategy Im glad not to be tasked with devising PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

North Carolina is the deepest and most balanced team left in the tournament making them the likely favorite to win a sixth national championship PERIOD

If you are a fan who admires watching the greatness of a storied college basketball brand name in action then by all means root for the Tar Heels PERIOD

Oklahoma Comparing a college standout to an established NBA superstar should be done with caution PERIOD However how can you not compare Buddy Hield to one Steph Curry Hield has had the best scoring tournament since Currys exploits propelled him to stardom in  and it does not help that both players boast an eerily similar style of play PERIOD

If watching star playersis your thing the Sooners are your team PERIOD Hield has willed his team to the national semifinals averaging  points per game while shooting  percent and  percent beyond the arc PERIOD The Sooners are not solely reliant on Hield which makes them so much tougher PERIOD Of course if Hield erupts for  points they are nearly unbeatable PERIOD

Villanovas only chance to sneak past Oklahoma is to deny Hield the ball off screens and to stalk him whenever he is on the floor PERIOD The Wildcats must be physical with him on every opportunity they get PERIOD Hield is such a mesmerizing ballhandler though he can easily create his own space to nail demoralizing stepback jumpersas he did to Oregon PERIOD

Villanova The Wildcats may be a No. seed but they emit an aura of a gritty defensiveminded teamoriented underdog without a definitive superstar PERIOD Its lack of a star playermakes up for a championship combination of team defense crisp ball movement and a killer instinct at the end of games PERIOD

Villanova played a nearly perfect defensive game by continually frustrating Kansas PERIOD The Wildcatsforced the Jayhawks into  turnovers and only  percent shooting from thethreepoint range PERIOD Most impressive of all the Wildcats limited Jayhawks starPerry Ellis to just five fieldgoal attempts and six points PERIOD

Plus is it possible not to enjoy watching senior captain Ryan Arcidiacono commandeer his team His high basketball IQ and ability to affect games in the smallest of ways has developed him into one of the stars in this years tournament PERIOD The timely turnover he forced in the final seconds against Kansas was justone example of what makes him and his team so compelling PERIOD

If you are a fan of teams that lack the star power and talent that other teams may have but compensate for it with a grinditout attitude you just haveto pull for Villanova PERIOD

Syracuse Syracuse in  is a spitting image of UConn in  PERIOD Both squads were sources of Selection Sundaycontroversy prior to making an unprecedented run toward a national championship PERIOD

The Orange are repeating the usual NCAA storyline of thelucky team that narrowly receives a tournament bid only to find a groove once they get in PERIOD It was definitely surprising to see Syracuse dominate the opening weekendnot to mentionseeing them make a late comeback against Gonzaga PERIOD

Then it was downright shocking to witness the magic of Syracuses jawdropping comeback against a defensive stalwart in Virginia PERIOD At the  mark in the second half the Cavaliers led by  PERIOD At the  mark the Orange were up by one PERIOD In the final nine and a halfminutes Syracuse only allowed four points PERIOD

Chalk another one up to the genius of head coachJim Boeheim and the puzzling mystery of the  zone PERIOD

Its difficult not to root for teams that make a championship run out of nowhere even if that team is a traditional basketball powerhouse PERIOD If you dig ugly yeteffective basketball Syracuse should strike your fancy PERIOD

National Championship Game Prediction The masterful shooting of Buddy Hield and the balanced offensive barrage of North Carolina will be too much for Villanova and Syracuse to handle PERIOD The championship matchup will create a heavyweight bout between two highoctane offenses and two highlyrespectedcoaches in OklahomasLon Kruger and North Carolinas Roy Williams PERIOD

Champion The size versatility athleticism and balance of the Tar Heels leads Williams to his third national championship PERIOD
