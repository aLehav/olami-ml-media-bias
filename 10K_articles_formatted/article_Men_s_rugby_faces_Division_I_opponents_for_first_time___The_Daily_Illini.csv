The start of the  season has had the Illinois mens rugby players sharing bloody lips and the occasional broken bones with unfamiliar opponents PERIOD

Following an undefeated  campaign as a Division II team the Fighting Illini became the only rugby team in the country to move up to the Division I level this offseason PERIOD

The move was mostly rooted in paperwork but it culminated when team president Bartek Czernikiewicz pleaded the teams case in front of the Midwest Rugby Football Unions board meeting last summer in Chicago PERIOD The board allowed Illinois to regain Division I status for the first time since the mid90s when it was dropped from the league following several struggling seasons PERIOD

Having primarily faced the state schools of Western Illinois Southern Illinois and Eastern Illinois on the Division II level the team now finds itself at the center of Big Ten competition PERIOD

Immediately the difference was evident PERIOD



From the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

You should have seen the pregame warmups of our first game starting forward Bill Roche said of the annual Big Ten Tournament PERIOD

Preparing to face Ohio State in the first match Roche and his teammates watched the Buckeyes show up in matching warmups and come out of their universitysponsored vans PERIOD

Some of us didnt even have matching uniforms Roche said of the Illini who drove their own cars to the tournament in Elkhart Ind PERIOD

Even with such disparity the Illini defeated the Buckeyes  finishing the tournament in fourth place with a  semifinal loss to Notre Dame the only team participating that was not from a Big Ten school PERIOD

After defeating Minnesota  in their first regular season match the Illini lost their next match  to Northern Iowa PERIOD On Saturday the Illini defeated Iowa State at home  to move to  on the season PERIOD

Were just trying to keep a level head and get used to the transition Czernikiewicz said PERIOD

Even still the team has already taken steps to become equivalent to their other Division I opponents PERIOD While Ohio State employs a full coaching staff and a training staff provided by the university the Illini recently just brought on a firstyear volunteer coach and has hired a private training service to attend games PERIOD

Other schools have a recruiting process and scholarships available for players while the Illinois team still remains a Registered Student Organization PERIOD Czernikiewicz said recruiting and scholarships would be nice but he would rather focus on getting the funds for amenities comparable to the teams competition PERIOD

First on the wish list is a full coaching staff PERIOD

Thatll be the first step in becoming a better program PERIOD We need better instruction Czernikiewicz said PERIOD

Czernikiewicz and the rest of the team is desperate for more funding and they know only success on the field can bring that PERIOD

Once we start getting attention for holding our own against the best teams more people in the administration will notice Czernikiewicz said

With volunteer head coach Paul Duquaine living nearly two hours away in Flora Ill. the bulk of the responsibilities have fallen in the hands of student leadership PERIOD

We have always been a studentrun organization and thats one of the reasons weve come to the high point where were at Roche said PERIOD We can stress what we want to stress like the social aspect of our team. the program has endured some incidents off the field in the last few years including dismissal from last years Division II playoffs because of what Roche would only describe as a few bad naked apples. looking to fix up its image to ensure more funding from the University the student leadership has tackled this issue head on trying to maintain the clubs reputation PERIOD

Strict policies regarding compromising situations have been implemented especially surrounding games and road trips PERIOD If players ever want to go out on the town they are forbidden to wear clothing connecting them to Illini rugby PERIOD

If we ever see our players wearing Illini rugby gear out when they shouldnt be well send them home Czernikiewicz said PERIOD

Roche explained the social aspect of the team goes beyond the stereotypical rowdy behavior PERIOD

Were like a family more than any other sport here on campus on and off the field Roche said PERIOD

A key component of offfield activities for the program has been community service PERIOD According to Czernikiewicz the team may be barely able to move on Sundays after our Saturday games but it still organizes some sort of volunteer effort on the Sunday mornings following Saturday matches PERIOD

Already this fall the team has helped move a fallen tree from an elderly couples front yard and raked leaves in many yards PERIOD

Senior forward Jason Yakubovich remembers three years ago when Hurricane Katrina hit the southern coast and the team drove down to help with the cleanup PERIOD Yakubovich and his teammates spent weeks clearing out an elementary school in New Orleans PERIOD

When we heard about it we packed a few cars and headed down to help Yakubovich said PERIOD It was a great experience. the team has various other events planned to stress the social side of the program including a teambonding trip to Oklahoma and Alabama over Thanksgiving break and has deemed Thursday nights to be Family Night. we rugby players need this bond to help each other as a team Roche said PERIOD We all need to have a few screws loose in the head to play rugby.",Men's rugby faces Division I opponents for first time - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
