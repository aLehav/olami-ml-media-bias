If theres one thing I just dont understand about UMass Boston its the universitys crisis of identity PERIOD We try to act like a traditional research university yet we just dont match up PERIOD In a way this seems like a lingering grudge from the days when we were renting out buildings in downtown Boston only to be cast to the outskirts to build a cloistered little enclave on top of a garbage dump  PERIOD
Lets be real here UMass Boston is a relatively affordable commuter school effectively outside of Boston proper with a large contingent of nontraditional studentsstudents who are older who speak English as a second language or who work at or nearly fulltime  PERIOD We are not Boston University PERIOD We are not UMass Amherst PERIOD And I cant believe that I actually have to say thisbut apparently I dowe sure as hell arent Harvard PERIOD
The sooner we accept this the better PERIOD This is not something we have to resign ourselves toit is something we ought to embrace PERIOD UMass Boston fills an important role as a reasonably large relatively affordable commutable public research university PERIOD It is accessible to students of so many different backgrounds in a way that most other large research universities in Boston are not PERIOD
Our administration doesnt seem to have a firm grasp on this fact PERIOD They make decisions as if and act like were UMass Amherst or Boston University and this attitude trickles down to faculty and even beyond PERIOD Ive known of at least two peopleone outside of UMass Boston and one faculty memberwho have actually compared various student organizations here to Harvard PERIOD
I think this stems from an ongoing effort on behalf of the administration to transform our university forcing it into an identity crisis PERIOD Building the residence halls was the biggest example of this in recent memory PERIOD
While I totally empathize with those who find it much easier and more convenient to live on campus UMass Boston has been without student residences for over  years  PERIOD While I understand that being the only Tier One university without a single residence hall practically demanded the campus of dorms  we effectively only offer rooms to firstyear students anyway  PERIOD
So building residence halls alone may have had some relatively balanced pros and conscons which were largely offset by the construction of West Parking Garage  PERIOD The subsequent increase in parking fees to make up for the dorms and the new parking was just horrible  PERIOD
Here we have a commuter school squeezing more money out of its commuters in part because of new oncampus housing PERIOD Now I know what youre saying But James shouldnt we be discouraging driving
Yes we should PERIOD But there are two caveats to this PERIOD One cars are an unavoidable reality at commuter campuses especially when T service is abysmal PERIOD Two the University should be actively encouraging public transportation at the same time and theyre not PERIOD
Did you know that every student used to have access to the heavily discounted Semester Pass no matter what  Nowadays passes must be claimed by Sept PERIOD 1and boast a measly  percent discount  PERIOD Ive also never heard of our administration lobbying for better public transportationin fact theyve actively shilled for the Dorchester Bay City project which is only going to make the public transportation situation worse  PERIOD
In moving onto the faculty side of things I want to be careful PERIOD See the upper administration is where the buck stopsI have no problem placing ultimate responsibility on them PERIOD However the faculty are regular workers just like you or I and they often have little to do at all with the larger moves of the administration PERIOD Teaching faculty are prime among this group most of them are simply focused on giving us a great education PERIOD
Like I said before the attitude that is put out by the upper administration trickles down PERIOD I have heard from the leaders of many different student organizations that their direct reports often gauge their progress and accomplishments against totally incomparable schools PERIOD Ive already mentioned that comparisons to Harvard have been made multiple times in the past even our professors notice this as I have recently discovered PERIOD
The simple fact of the matter is that we cannot live up to the expectations placed on other universities PERIOD The vast vast majority of us dont live here and so many of us are simply unable to devote time to extracurricular activities on campus PERIOD
Its incredible to me that I have to explain why we cant be compared to Harvard and honestly Im not going to PERIOD Whoever is doing so needs to do a little critical thinking for themselves on that one PERIOD
Were not UMass Amherst either or even UMass Dartmouth PERIOD We are unique we are extremely diversein the broadest sense of that termand we must embrace that PERIOD We need to focus on growing as an affordable commuter school that upholds a good quality of education and engages in communitybetterment work and research PERIOD Thats it PERIOD Everything else is ancillary PERIOD
Yes Ive repeatedly advocated for improvement of campus life PERIOD But the way to do that isnt for the administration to pour money and effort into revamping how student organizations work heavily supervising them and renovating their spaces PERIOD
I have learned that the clubs and student organizations used to be very active until COVID19 turned everything upside down PERIOD They havent bounced back since the worst of COVID19 passed and I really believe it is primarily due to meddling from the administration PERIOD So the solution is to leave us the hell alone stop placing ridiculous restrictions on how we run things and focus on what I said above PERIOD
Heres the bottom line UMass Boston has a chance to be the best at what it is PERIOD It can only do so if we stop comparing our university to Boston University UMass Amherst or Harvard PERIOD We must develop our uniqueness if we want to serve our students as best we can PERIOD
