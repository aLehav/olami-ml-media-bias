Oklahoma State forward Haley Woodward returned to action Friday night in the Cowgirls  loss to Iowa State after she missed four games with a concussion PERIOD

After missing four games with a concussion sophomore forward Haley Woodard returned to the pitch Friday night for the Cowgirl soccer team PERIOD

Woodard came on as a substitute in the twenty-eighth minute as Oklahoma State fell to Iowa State  in its Big  opener PERIOD

Throughout her  minutes of action Woodard made an impact with her speed and elusiveness while sending in an abundance of quality crosses that tested ISUs back line PERIOD

However ISU  overall  Big  had luck on its side as they pulled out every stop including several blocked shots and kept the Cowgirls off the board PERIOD

Woodard who suffered the concussion in practice a couple of weeks ago said the loss was painful but she was glad to be back out there PERIOD

It was very tiring she said PERIOD But I was really excited because I dont think Ive ever missed that many games in my life. after falling behind in the thirty-first minute Woodard and the Cowgirls  01created multiple scoring chances with the majority coming in the final  minutes as the ball was constantly in ISU territory PERIOD

We were trying to dig deep and say this is our time and it was time to get a lucky break Woodard said PERIOD And we all felt it coming but it just didnt happen. woodard said coach Colin Carmichael told the players they deserved to win but sometimes soccer can be cruel PERIOD

He said he really feels for us Woodard said PERIOD I think that we played very well and it sucks PERIOD But I think that Sunday we have a hard game we know what to expect and were ready we just need a win to get our confidence back. oSUs next match will be against Baylor at  p.m PERIOD Sunday at the Cowgirl Soccer Complex PERIOD
