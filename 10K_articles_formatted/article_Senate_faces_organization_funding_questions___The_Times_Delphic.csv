8062,2010-10-24,"in a meeting lasting just  minutes Student Senate allocated over  but not without asking a few questions PERIOD

The funding went to four different campus organizations and senators spent more than half the meeting asking Treasurer Nate Bleadorn organization representatives and one another about the allocated funds PERIOD

The largest single amount was  given to Students for Womens Issues PERIOD The money will help pay to bring speaker Jean Kilbourne to Drake during Body Image Week in early November PERIOD

The reason we want to bring Jean Kilbourne to Drakes campus is because shes such a wellknown speaker sophomore SWI Vice President Sheila Brassel told the senators PERIOD We think its very important to have her come PERIOD Also weve received an overwhelming amount of faculty approval. attendance for a similar speaker two years ago was much less than theyd hoped for with different sources citing anywhere from  to  people in the audience PERIOD Brassel said SWI saw that changing in part as a result of so much faculty support PERIOD

Because of the implied extra credit we believe well have a very large audience she said PERIOD

You better was Senates implicit message during the discussion that followed PERIOD The motion approving the funding passed easily but not before emphatic statements by several senators PERIOD They insisted upon effective promotion for the event so that the money spent was more proportional to the number of students present at the lecture PERIOD

I do think this is a great idea but I would definitely encourage SWI to plug it across campus Sen PERIOD Rachel Kauffold said PERIOD Twentyfive people for  is not OK.

Sen PERIOD Dana Hansen asked senators voting in favor of approving the allocation to look for ways Senate could help with publicity PERIOD

When youre thinking about whether to give this money think about ways we can support this event as well she said PERIOD

The Drake lacrosse club received the second largest sum  to cover transportation registration and equipment costs associated with the Central Iowa Lacrosse Association winter league PERIOD

Before that motion was passed three different senators and vice president of student life Byron Spears questioned the clubs president senior Ben Shoff about how the funds were being spent and about future fundraising plans PERIOD

He mentioned their Tshirt drive plans to pick up after Des Moines Buccaneers games a letterwriting campaign and his recent meetings to discuss the matter with Lisa Murphy Drakes assistant director of recreational services PERIOD

Senate approved the allocation but also emphasized a need for the club to devise other ways of securing funding PERIOD

Also during the meeting the Drake dance team received  to cover choreographer and entry costs associated with the Iowa State Dance Competition and . was taken from the reserve fund and given to Colleges Against Cancer to donate to the American Cancer Society PERIOD

Bleadorn called the last allocation kind of an interesting situation. the motion was actually for CAC to reclaim the money which was part of the sum given to the organization last school year PERIOD But they were unable to complete their donation before the year ended and because unused funds are rolled into the reserve fund they had not been allowed access to them PERIOD

Unlike the other allocations the CAC fund reclaiming motion passed without debate or discussion PERIOD



Interesting stuff PERIOD I enjoyed reading this article PERIOD Thanks Ann please keep this sort of stuff coming PERIOD

The title of the article makes it seem like knowing what was going in Senate had some sort of real controversy PERIOD In reality theres no controversy just Senate being Senate PERIOD
