With the commencement of  students are no doubt making and perhaps already breaking a fresh set of New Years resolutions PERIOD While I certainly believe that January is the perfect time to implement positive changes I cant help but feel discouraged that so many people including myself almost inevitably end up breaking their resolutions within a few months PERIOD

There seems to be plenty of reasons why this happens sometimes the goals chosen are simply too big and too difficult to achieve PERIOD Other times they are not specific enough and it can be difficult to determine where and how to begin the process of fulfilling them PERIOD

One idea which doesnt seem to be discussed very often is the fact that people frequently choose goals that they wont enjoy fulfilling PERIOD While this makes sense after all if you resolve to lose five pounds the chances that youll be jumping for joy while cutting your calorie intake are probably slim it still acts as a legitimate explanation for why some people if not most find it difficult to maintain their New Years resolutions PERIOD

Last year I decided to try to break this cycle of picking and inevitably breaking unenjoyable resolutions PERIOD In searching for what goal I would focus on for the next year I instead thought about something I would really like to learn PERIOD In the end I decided that I would learn how to swing dance PERIOD I had tried it briefly a few years earlier and had enjoyed it and I figured that if I chose a fun resolution that I had been wanting to work on anyway I would have a better chance of fulfilling it PERIOD

So I started attending a local swing dancing club and picked up as many tips and tricks as I could PERIOD I went pretty consistently throughout the year and eventually became reasonably competent and learned several different types of swing dancing PERIOD There were certainly difficulties and discouragements along the way but in the end I enjoyed what I was doing and consequently stuck with it PERIOD

This year Im adopting a similar attitude and picking a goal that Ive been wanting to fulfill for some time now PERIOD In  I plan to run a race PERIOD While I know that training may be difficult at times I also know that I enjoy working out and that this will ultimately be a very rewarding experience PERIOD

My mom always says that anything worth having in life requires hard work PERIOD I certainly agree with that statement but I think that most people make the unconscious determination that hard work is inherently unenjoyable PERIOD This is certainly not the case PERIOD On the contrary its perfectly fine even beneficial to pick a difficult New Years resolution but you will likely have a much more positive experience and increase your likelihood of success if its also one that you will find fun PERIOD

With that in mind consider looking at your New Years resolution differently this year PERIOD Pick up a hobby that youve always wanted to try or cross an item off your bucket list PERIOD In the end youll have a much more enjoyable experience PERIOD
