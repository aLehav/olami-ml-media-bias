According to Shakespeare that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet PERIOD But according to social scientists names are more consequential than that PERIOD

As kids many of us were showered with rosetinted platitudes like You can become anything you want to be if you work hard enough. while these promises come from a good place they are unfortunately overly optimistic PERIOD The circumstances into which people are born are often reflected in their names which can then affect their socioeconomic outcomes as adults PERIOD

For example Steve Levitt the author of the bestseller Freakonomics conducted an observational study with fellow economist Roland Fryer in which they followed the lives of Black women born in the 1970s given either names more commonly associated with the Black community like Aaliyah and Tyrone or names more traditionally whiteassociated names like Alice and Tyler PERIOD They concluded that while names themselves are not strongly correlated with socioeconomic outcomes they are correlated with ones socioeconomic status at birth PERIOD That is what actually affects later outcomes PERIOD The data set Levitt and Fryer used showed a higher incidence of ethnic names in lowerincome areas while in wealthier neighborhoods Black babies were more likely to be given traditionally white names PERIOD This particular analysis showed only an indirect relationship between names and success but other studies suggest a causal connection PERIOD

One would hope things have since improved but twenty years later in  economists from the University of California Berkeley and the University of Chicago experimentally sent out  fake resumes to over  Fortune  companies and found similar results PERIOD All variables were controlled and randomized except the name of the applicant yet on average Black applicants received  fewer callbacks per  applications sent than white applicants PERIOD

Theres also the question of distinctive names that have no clear ethnic or cultural ties but are simply meant to raise eyebrows PERIOD Recently as celebrities deem it increasingly fashionable to give their children unusual names without explanation  from the relatively tame Stormi to the more provocative X  AXII  everyday Americans have hopped on the bandwagon PERIOD Such names at best can briefly spotlight the parents and can at worst harm the childs future raising the question of what the appropriate balance is between preserving traditional names and taking the road less traveled PERIOD

Millennials and likely Gen Z as well when the time comes are predisposed to seeking out quirky names for their children and turning up their noses at oldfashioned classics PERIOD When we eventually name the next generation however it might be wise to remember that the world is currently kinder to names that blend in than those that stand out PERIOD

Nevertheless realism and idealism are not mutually exclusive PERIOD Alongside understanding and accepting the imperfect ways in which the world works we can simultaneously be the ones to catalyze change by embracing the diversity of names and rooting out subconscious prejudice  whether thats through advocating for nameblind club applications here at Georgetown University or checking our own biases when we reach positions of power in the workforce PERIOD

A name is more than just several letters strung together PERIOD For many of us it represents key parts of our identity and it signals to the world where we may come from PERIOD Ive been thinking about the implications of identity  and by extension names  more than usual lately as I apply to clubs on campus PERIOD

Georgetown is infamous for its cutthroat club culture a precursor to the even more grueling job search later down the road PERIOD The everincreasing competitiveness in the labor market is essentially a product of too many talented people vying for too few coveted positions and to expedite the process of narrowing down such large pools preconceived notions based on initial impressions  ones name being the first  creep in PERIOD

My own name Shivali has deep cultural and religious roots PERIOD Its another name for the Hindu goddess Parvati literally beloved of Shiva PERIOD But its also fairly uncommon variants like Shivani are far more prevalent and readily recognizable PERIOD

When I was younger I strongly disliked my name frequently halfjoking that Id have it changed to Shivani PERIOD Now I realize that my parents gave me the best of both worlds something old and something relatively new PERIOD It may not roll off the tongue as easily but Ill take that trade PERIOD
