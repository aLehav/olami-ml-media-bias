During the month of August Quinnipiac students prepared for their move back to their home away from home PERIOD However the entire QU community does not walk the quad this fall instead some students are walking through the streets of different countries PERIOD

Studying abroad has taken some of our students to different universities for the semester PERIOD Among them is Michael Morano a junior finance major from New Jersey PERIOD Morano is currently in London England at Regents College PERIOD

Campus life for Morano at Regents College has been different than that at QU PERIOD He said that everyone on campus may recognize faces from class or from there residence building but may not know who they are PERIOD At Regents despite being there for such a short time Morano probably knows as much or even more students than at QU PERIOD

There is only one dorm and all the buildings are connected PERIOD All the resident students get to know each other and become friends Morano said PERIOD

Last semester QU students looked for ways to make the perfect schedule such as having days end early night classes or having no Friday classes PERIOD Study abroad students at Regents College dont have to worry PERIOD The college does not offer Friday classes PERIOD

More than likely QU students on campus do the same activities every weekend PERIOD Morano on the other hand travels to different areas of Europe on his weekends PERIOD

This past weekend I went to Milan and Bergamo Italy and had a great time Morano said PERIOD Two weeks before I went on a school sponsored trip to Leeds castle and Canterbury PERIOD This weekend Im going on another school sponsored trip to Warwick castle and StratfordUponAvon. normally when school starts the hopes of a long weekend or vacation are in the back of students minds PERIOD Distractions are always lurking around the corner for those on campus from club meetings to partying in New Haven PERIOD Everything about Europe screams distraction for a study abroad student and awaiting these adventuress weekends makes studying abroad seem like more of vacation than college life PERIOD

For Morano studying abroad has been an educational experience along with a vacation PERIOD

I feel slightly distracted by my new setting however it is very interesting Morano said PERIOD Never before have I taken the London tube on a field trip to the Tower of London to see something like the Crown Jewels. the teachers know we are here to study abroad and see London and Europe so they are lenient to a point said Morano PERIOD

One of Moranos professors even encouraged him to return to Milan to see a football soccer game before his return to the states PERIOD

While professors expect you to take your classes seriously whether it is at QU or during a study abroad the majority of professors abroad seem to encourage students to experience and take advantage of their foreign and exciting surroundings and  culture while abroad PERIOD

If I could give advice to someone who might be interested I would tell them to do it PERIOD Here you become a part of the city in which you are living and actually come close to becoming a local PERIOD My new friends and I have given directions so far to countless amounts of tourists and a few locals as well Morano said PERIOD
