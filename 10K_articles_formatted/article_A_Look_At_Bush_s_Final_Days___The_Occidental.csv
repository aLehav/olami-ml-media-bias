As we watch the final weeks of the George W PERIOD Bush presidency unfold or unravel I cant help but wonder what happened to the more caustic and fiery attacks on our headofstate PERIOD A year ago at this time everyone was involved in the usual scathing discourses on Bushs ineptitude miscommunications and general failures as a leader PERIOD Now that we are almost in the wake of one of the most turbulent and derided presidencies in American history I can honestly say that I am relieved to witness an end to the anger PERIOD Actually it ended almost a year agoBush has been living in the shadowy recesses of the political stage ever since the primaries began in early  PERIOD The only question now is how he will make his exit.I have to admit that I feel a measure of pity for Bush PERIOD Yes he has been wrong on many grave and dangerous issuesthe Iraq War not the least of themand he very possibly invited the demise of the economy but I still feel genuinely sorry for the man PERIOD He is not pure evil just incompetentand while he should not have been instated as President I can imagine him being excellent company on a fishing trip PERIOD I am glad for his sake that this past year was less strenuous than his previous years in office PERIOD He got to bask in obscurity while first the party contenders then the presidential candidates distracted the public eye PERIOD I am sure he received the idea of someone filling his place with relief.These days we meet the mention of Bush more with a tired smile than a thundering tirade PERIOD The Bush years have left us all exhausted and I am glad that our rage has subsided to mild humor PERIOD I will not forget what Bush has to answer for but to some extent his name has degenerated to the state of an overtold joke in my mind PERIOD It is true that he can still do damage in the remaining weeks of his presidency PERIOD He still has time to make at least one rash and disastrous decision PERIOD But if everything remains more or less as it is until Barack Obama is sworn into office Bush can escape quietly and we can let the past die.My recommendation for Bushs final agenda is mostly a list of Thou shalt nots. he should not make any major decisions on the economy without the complete agreement of Obama and his aides PERIOD He should not make any sudden moves in Eastern Europe that would leave his successor to deal with an irate Russia PERIOD He should probably not sign anything of his own device with the word Iraq on it PERIOD If there is one thing that would be wisest for Bush at this point it would be to invest most of his energy in making the transition to an Obama presidency smooth and relatively painless.If we as a nation are going to enact Obamas message of change and unity it would be in everyones best interests to let Bush off the proverbial hook PERIOD I for one grew tired of the invective long before it ceased PERIOD Let us wash America of the filth of partisanship and blame by letting Bush make a graceful albeit quiet exit PERIOD Let us not disgrace ourselves by living incessantly in the pastand let us hope that Bush does not disgrace himself further PERIOD
