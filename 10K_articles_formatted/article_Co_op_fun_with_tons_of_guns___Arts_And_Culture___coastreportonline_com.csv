Some clouds PERIOD Low 56F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm





Borderlands  is available now at most retail stores PERIOD

Its time to step back in to the futuristicwestern scifi actionadventure world of Pandora PERIOD

Borderlands  Gearboxs sequel to the  Borderlands hit shelves on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD

It brings us new characters as well as some old favorites much better quest lines and the same superb cell shaded graphics PERIOD

Claptrap is back with his hilarious jokes and random side quests including one where he wants to throw himself a birthday party PERIOD

Also returning is Mad Moxxie Scooter and a few other surprise characters from the original Borderlands. there are four playable characters right out of the box the gunzerker Salvador the siren Maya Axton the commando and Zer0 the assassin PERIOD

Each character is similar to the characters in the original game PERIOD

There is also another class the mechromancer named Gaige who is set to release via digital download Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

She is free to those who preordered the game . on PlayStation Network or  Microsoft points on Xbox Live PERIOD

You can still customize your characters with different skins like the original but there are more choices in the sequel PERIOD

Gameplay in Borderlands  does not differ much from the original PERIOD

There is a basic main storyline quest and many side quests PERIOD

Enemies are still similar to the original and at times can be incredibly difficult PERIOD It is not uncommon to run out of ammo frequently PERIOD

The game relies pretty heavily on the coop factor which is a good and bad thing PERIOD

Axtons turret makes fighting aerial units a breeze PERIOD

Maya has healing abilities in one skill tree such as shooting a comrade to heal them PERIOD

But if you are playing alone especially as a character like Maya the game can be more difficult than it should be PERIOD

The game succeeds where the original failed by giving us a strong villain Handsome Jack and it elaborates on and improves the abrupt ending of the original PERIOD

Quests are more fleshed out with a lot more voice acting so it isnt as reliant on reading quest text PERIOD

Quests arent as static so now you dont have to worry about trying to read a quest while your friends are rushing you to come on PERIOD

The downfall to this though is that it is a little hard to pay attention to what the quest givers are saying while on headset listening to your party and they continue to talk no matter what you are doing so you can easily get distracted fighting enemies and not hear the quest PERIOD

One other thing to note is the fantastic soundtrack PERIOD Jesper Kyd known for the original Borderlands and the Assassins Creed series returns as the composer PERIOD

It really adds to the western feel of the game PERIOD The opening cut scenes combination of music and graphics easily makes it one of the more impressive I have seen in a long time PERIOD

The original Borderlands holds the Guiness World Record for most guns in a video game with over  million guns and Borderlands  exceeds that PERIOD

If you like coop firstperson shooter RPGs comedy and an insane amount of guns Borderlands  has all that and more PERIOD
