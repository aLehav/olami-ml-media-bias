Two weeks ago recordbreaking rainfall caused extreme flooding in areas not only in Baton Rouge but also in Ponchatoula and other towns in Tangipahoa Parish PERIOD Some have lost everything in the flood and will now have to begin the rebuilding process PERIOD However the Lions and Lady Lions athletic teams did not let them go through it alone as they immediately went to aid members of the community PERIOD

Pretty much all of our teams were out said Athletic Director Jay Artigues PERIOD I dont have the total number but I know baseball alone gutted and cleaned out a lot of houses PERIOD Basketball went out football went out soccer volleyball etcetera PERIOD It was tremendous PERIOD That outpouring of support from our coaches and our student athletes was outstanding. the mission was to help and they started with their own players and coaches that were affected PERIOD Afterwards they began to help anyone and everyone that needed it PERIOD

There is so many people out there who need help and you want to reach out to all of them said Artigues PERIOD We definitely tried to find people that work in the athletic department families at Southeastern whether it was athletics or anything even students that were affected PERIOD Once we reached out to them we started pouring it out and just helping in general the entire community PERIOD It was very exciting and humbling to see the outpour and support from our student athletes. there were several student athletes and coaches that lost everything in the flooding and are still rebuilding and recuperating from this disaster PERIOD

Several students our coaches were affected by it said Artigues PERIOD We did have staff members affected and several student athletes PERIOD We went out and helped a lot of them and it is making a big difference. artigues remembers when he had dealt with a similar ordeal during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina PERIOD

I went through Katrina and had six feet of water in my house and it is humbling said Artigues PERIOD You dont know what to do PERIOD And now seeing people go through that you know where they are at PERIOD They just need someone to put their arm around you and say they got it and they will help you out and that is what is happening. head baseball Coach Matt Riser rallied his team almost before any of the other teams to start the flood relief effort PERIOD

We started discussing the possibility on Sunday when we realized how many areas the flooding was starting to affect said Riser PERIOD The coaching staff was discussing plans when a few players started to reach out with the same idea PERIOD We sent out the message to meet at  a.m PERIOD on Monday morning and made it completely voluntary PERIOD Thirtyeight of the forty players showed up to help at some point during the week PERIOD We had one guy trapped and another who had surgery PERIOD All the other guys  percent volunteered PERIOD It was awesome to see how willing our guys were to participate. after the flooding had gone down Riser and his players witnessed how much work needed to be done for the affected areas to recover PERIOD

I cannot speak for some of the areas but I know we went to Denham Springs on Monday and it was complete devastation said Riser PERIOD I have not seen anything like it since Hurricane Katrina PERIOD It looked like a third world country in the middle of a war PERIOD It was an eye opener for all of the young men to see ground zero. the Lions basketball coaches thankfully did not lose everything but were not able to get back to their homes due to the flooding and roadblocks PERIOD

Most of our coaches were affected said Mens Head basketball Coach Jay Ladner PERIOD Coach Roane coach Wilson coach Witherspoon and coach Kiefer PERIOD Four of our coaches lived in Springfield and were displaced PERIOD They could not get in or get out but thankfully their houses were not destroyed. with the classes now having started yesterday the focus for all athletics now has to shift to school and for some teams towards the upcoming season PERIOD

We have decided that after helping  homes and families that it was time for us to start concentrating on school said Riser PERIOD The number of families affected by the storm will take months to recover PERIOD I believe we have influenced a number of different organizations to follow our lead. however athletics will try to work around school if necessary in order to continue to provide help to those who in the community who still need it PERIOD

We are going to still look for opportunities said Ladner PERIOD Obviously everything has gotten thrown in disarray and our players need to focus on classes PERIOD So what we are going to have to do is maybe go out in the evening instead of during the day PERIOD There is still a lot to be done. the Lions and Lady Lions have set a huge example in how to respond and lend a helping hand when disaster strikes the community PERIOD

I have never been more proud of our young men in my ten years at Southeastern said Riser PERIOD I have never been more proud of our entire student body student athletes and alumni PERIOD I have never been more proud to be a Lion for life. head baseball Coach Matt Riser above along with players helping to pull up the damaged floors in a house PERIOD The baseball team has helped  families since the flooding and was one of the first teams to start helping in the aftermath PERIOD  File Photo
