I believe I can turn this abstract idea into something concrete using a recent event on campus PERIOD The university allowed this years student production of  to take place on campus PERIOD However it had not allowed this in years past citing that the play portrayed sexuality in contrast to the Catholic Churchs teachings PERIOD 
That may be true but the play also effectively teaches the audience about female sexuality on a whole and the horrors of violence against women throughout the world PERIOD
