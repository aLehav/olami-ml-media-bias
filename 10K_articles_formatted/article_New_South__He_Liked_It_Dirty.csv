On August   Georgetown cashed a check that my father had signed for . pERIOD On August  my mother walked into New South PERIOD Barely  seconds later she screamed If you think that Im going to pay  for you to live in this goddamn shithole youre fucking nuts. ahhh yes New South PERIOD Also known as Dirty South the Dirty New Sizz and the Sizzito PERIOD My mother was right  it was a shithole PERIOD A shithole that I desperately wanted to live in PERIOD I even handwrote a threepage letter to the Housing Office explaining to them that theyd be ruining my life if they forced me to live in an awful place called Village C PERIOD If I remember correctly the letter even quoted Sartre at some point  PERIOD who does that
Yet four years later Im convinced that writing that letter was the best idea Ive ever had PERIOD
At Georgetown Ive had more fun than some people do in a lifetime and quite a bit of that fun came from the days when we still had to hide our booze from the RA PERIOD In fact every time I sat down to write this reflection I thought of a story from the Sizz so I decided to stop my attempts at being clever and just share the most important lessons I learned in the Dirty
Seth Cohen isnt the only cool kid from the O.C PERIOD
Ad
Im from the O.C PERIOD Yup thats right Orange County PERIOD Orange County  PERIOD New York PERIOD The OCo as we called it long before Ryan entered the Cohen household straddles the border of the bluecollar suburbs and the middle of nowhere PERIOD
When I first met people in the Sizzito they naturally asked where I was from PERIOD When people asked where a little town called ontgomery was I didnt know what to say PERIOD I wanted to make friends but everyone else at Georgetown seemed to have a perfect New England pedigree I just had Yaffa blocks and bed sheets from Target PERIOD The kid down the hall wore Ralph Lauren corduroys with lobsters embroidered on them  I was going to need something to be friends with this guy PERIOD When he asked me where Montgomery was I quickly answered Uuuuh its in Rockland County substituting the name of a slightlynicer but almost equally obscure suburb for my own PERIOD
As soon as I said it I realized what a dumb mistake I had made PERIOD Now I was cornered  if I told the truth Id be the guy who lies about where hes from forever doomed to spend weekends with the girl who lies about her boyfriend from home. so I perpetuated my little fib until a friend from high school came and spilled the beans PERIOD
Surprisingly enough no one cared though they still make fun of me for it to this day PERIOD I never bought a pair of Nantucket reds and my friends still like me  PERIOD must be the pair of yellow shorts that I broke down and bought sophomore year PERIOD
Your true friends are the ones you spit on PERIOD
Once I spit water all over friends who were trying to take care of me PERIOD Then I kissed my roommates girlfriend PERIOD Another time I almost cried because I was drunk in front of our chaplaininresidence PERIOD Then there was the time that we had a pool party at my house and my friends thought it would be a good idea to go skinnydipping PERIOD And only NS4 kids would think that the best way to introduce my 16yearold sister to college life would be to feed her shots of  PERIOD
Ive been through a lot with my New South friends and theyve been through a lot with me but NS4 has somehow stuck together as a core for the last four years PERIOD The majority of my best friends are still the people who saw me leaving the shower in nothing but a towel every morning and I wouldnt be surprised if I end up at a lot of New South weddings in the next few years theyll be like the NS4 reunion golf parties we have now only well be dressed up and hopefully theyll be less incestual PERIOD
Republicans arent all dumb  PERIOD but theyre still wrong PERIOD
On Sept PERIOD   George Bush addressed a joint session of Congress in response to  PERIOD By the end of the speech my liberal biases made me want to vomit PERIOD Within  seconds of Ws final If you dont do as I say youre with the terrorists two girls came running down the hall cheering and waving the Stars and Stripes  no really PERIOD I thought they were out of their minds PERIOD Three thousand people had just died and theyre cheering as George Bush announces his plan to take over the world The thought of having to see those two girls every day for the rest of the year disgusted me PERIOD
Those two girls became two very good friends they may even have the distinction of being my first Republican friends PERIOD Though I preached the need for racial ethnic and sexual tolerance ad nauseum I quite simply couldnt deal with people who disagreed PERIOD Once I started listening I learned that Republicans as a group are in fact not categorically stupid PERIOD They do however have some really brainless ideas about Social Security PERIOD
Do it for the story PERIOD
All of us graduating have some good stories to tell  it wouldnt be college without the things that seemed like a good idea at the time PERIOD I have loads of them and so many came from New South PERIOD We were furious when the hostess at Dennys wouldnt let us make reservations we dressed up as the Publishers Clearing House Prize Patrol for Halloween we went to a club in Miami where the doorman was wearing a sequin jumpsuit and believed him when he told us that we wouldnt see anyone sketchy in his club PERIOD These four years have taken me a lot of places  including a Tuesdaynight trip to a diner in northern New Jersey at  a.m PERIOD because I reaaaalllly wanted cheesecake PERIOD I always did it for the story but I didnt do anything alone whether I was at Beaujolais night freshman year or hiking the mountains of Peru as a senior every one of my favorite memories ties back to New South PERIOD
Like a lot of things Dirty South was the kind of place that was amazing you just had to look past the dirt and grime  or at least the gnats nested in the showers PERIOD It bred the kind of things that freshman years are made of sketchy RAs endless drama between roomies and  a.m PERIOD pizza in the lounge with that kid from down the hall that you never really knew that well PERIOD Its the kind of place where friendships are born over watching reruns of Family Ties and straightshooting  for the record that was an awful idea PERIOD Its the place where I became comfortable with myself and met the friends that will be there for life PERIOD
New South  we liked it dirty PERIOD
