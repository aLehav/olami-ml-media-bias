MOST UNPRODUCTIVE DAY OF THE YEAR DISCOVERED

Students who had trouble getting their work done this past Monday may have an excuse rooted in a poll recently published by Promotur the tourism board for the Canary Islands PERIOD Promotur found that more than half of all workers had a noticeable drop in productivity on Oct PERIOD  last year according to The Register a UK newspaper PERIOD

In addition to that  percent of workers spoke to their bosses about their drops in productivity and  percent called in sick PERIOD

The reason for this scientists believe is that this date last year coincided with the end of daylight saving time and came in conjunction with poor weather PERIOD This lends credence to the theory of Seasonal Affective Disorder SAD which is a mental condition where the shorter days and cold weather cause a loss of productivity and an uptick in depression PERIOD

This year however the date daylight saving time ends is Sunday Nov PERIOD  so it wouldnt be a bad idea to get started on whatever work you have due Monday PERIOD

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SUSPENDS ENVIRONMENTAL JOURNALISM PROGRAM

Rising tuition and shrinking financial aid have forced Columbia University to temporarily suspend its Environmental Journalism dualdegree program which allows graduate students to earn masters degrees in both Journalism and Environmental Science according to the Columbia Journalism Review PERIOD

Ultimately the decision comes across as an act of intended mercy for both school and student PERIOD A primary reason for suspending the program according to the official statement is that journalism jobs are scarce worldwide and there are only so many opportunities for environmental journalism PERIOD

 the letter read 

The chances of the program reopening hedge on whether Columbia can resume funding it which means the entire economy might have to recover for students to be able to enroll in the prestigious program PERIOD
