On May  attorney Kevin M PERIOD Hayes on behalf of the University of Oregons intellectual property counsel wrote a letter to the current leader of the Oregonians for Immigration Reform Cynthia Kendoll in regards to the similarities between the the UOs O logo and the the logo being used by OFIR PERIOD

OFIR an antiimmigration organization that was labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center was cofounded by Jim Ludwick and two others in  PERIOD Ludwick originally from San Diego served as president of OFIR from  to  before being replaced by Kendoll PERIOD Ludwick claims that the O logo attached to the organization looks nothing like UOs PERIOD

We designed the logo in  PERIOD It actually predates the UOs logo Ludwick said PERIOD And youve seen the difference PERIOD Nobody would mistake our O for the University of Oregons O. its crazy. the first usage of the Oregon O designed by Nike was in  PERIOD The letter became the schools official mark in  and trademarked in  PERIOD

OFIR is known for successfully helping to overturn a  bill that granted undocumented immigrants the ability to get drivers licenses PERIOD Theyre currently collecting signatures attempting to repeal Oregons decades old Sanctuary City laws which offer legal protections for undocumented immigrants PERIOD The group needs to collect  signatures to qualify for the ballot by November PERIOD

Christopher Chavez associate professor in the advertising department at UOs School of Journalism and Communication said that the OFIR O has enough in common with the UOs to be considered problematic PERIOD

I do think that it does warrant a concern for the university PERIOD The specific color of green and the shape of the O are similar enough that they have the potential to cause confusion Chavez said PERIOD

Chavez maintains that OFIR is likely aware of the similarities between logos possibly attempting to align themselves with the nationally recognized Oregon logo PERIOD

OFIR is simply trying to present a friendly face to what many consider to be a hate group PERIOD The Oregon logo has become synonymous with the state of Oregon and generally received favorably PERIOD OFIR is likely hoping to capitalize on that positive sentiment Chavez said PERIOD

UO spokesperson Tobin Klinger said that its common for the university to send out letters asking organizations to change their logo because its too similar or identical PERIOD

Over the last three years for example nearly  such cease and desist letters have been sent Klinger said PERIOD As have nearly  of whats known as take down requests which are sent to request vendors remove items for sale that use the O without permission. according to UO advertising professor Kim Sheehan many people could potentially associate OFIRs O without thinking about it too much PERIOD

Many people will look at a logo very quickly and then associate it with something thats already in their memory  for this reason I would anticipate that some people will assume the OFIR is affiliated with the UO given that the UOs logo is most likely much more wellknown than OFIRs Sheehan said PERIOD OFIR will benefit from the positive goodwill generated by the O. UO has more to lose perhaps as the mission of OFIR seems to go against the mission of the UO and any connection with OFIR will harm the UOs brand. uO freshman Veronika Vike doesnt believe that the logo is similar enough to garner this type of attention PERIOD

I dont think its that big of a deal Vike said PERIOD To me all this press is just bringing more attention to the group in general PERIOD Bad press is still press. oFIR founder Ludwick remains unconvinced that UO actually cares about the logo in the first place citing political motives as the real reason for the letter PERIOD

I dont think they actually have a problem with the logo.They want to say they have trouble with it just to go against us PERIOD I think its purely a political move by the university Ludwick said PERIOD

UO sent the letter only five days after the University of Oregon Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln or MEChA a student group that provides resources for Latinx students in higher education sent a letter to the UOs General Counsel detailing the resemblance of the two Os and asked for action to be taken against the group PERIOD

Ludwick confirmed that OFIRs attorney had sent a response back to UO before the May  deadline PERIOD The contents of the letter havent been made public due to the pending status of the case PERIOD
