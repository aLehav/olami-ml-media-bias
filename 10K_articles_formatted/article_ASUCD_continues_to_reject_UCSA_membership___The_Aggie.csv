The University of California Student Association UCSA is engaging in a renewed effort to mend its tumultuous relationship with ASUCD in light of impending fee increases and this years instance of police brutality on campus PERIOD

UCSA is a coalition of student organizations providing the official undergraduate and graduate stance on university issues PERIOD Since ASUCDs cessation of membership in  UC Davis is the only UC campus not represented in UCSA PERIOD

According to ASUCD Senator Justin Goss senior political science and philosophy double major one of the primary reasons for the secession and the current frictional relationship is ASUCDs unwillingness to pay for UCSAs membership dues PERIOD

There are a number of reasons for leaving UCSA Goss said PERIOD Number one its just really expensive. in order to become a member student organizations would have to pay a minimum fee of . per student PERIOD This means that ASUCD would have to charge an additional  percent to students and allocate more than  from their budget to UCSA annually PERIOD

Meanwhile Lobby Corps the main lobbying arm of ASUCD received a subsidy of  from ASUCD for the  academic year PERIOD

The majority of the revenue from membership dues goes toward UCSAs support staff directors and field organizers PERIOD The money is also used to organize statewide student conferences and protest activities PERIOD

A major contention between ASUCD and UCSA is the increase in the minimum contribution from . to . between  and  PERIOD

Considering the tuition hikes weve seen you would think that UCSA would want to alleviate some financial burden from the students Goss said PERIOD But these dues have actually been increasing proportionally with tuition. other campuses such as UC Santa Cruz contribute significantly more to the organization PERIOD Students at Santa Cruz pay over  annually to be part of UCSA PERIOD

At other campuses it depends on the governing structure of the students said Keith Ellis UCSA Board Secretary and fifth year political science and management major at UC Merced PERIOD They pay more because they understand that UCSA is a good investment for the students. opponents of ASUCDs readmission into UCSA also note that the organizations lack of professionalism renders its advocacy strategy ineffective PERIOD

The stunts and rallies that UCSA undertakes comes off as excessively flashy and ostentatious Goss said PERIOD Legislators just end up rolling their eyes at all of this. sergio Cano chair of Internal Affairs Commission said that in the past ASUCDs needs werent met because of the decisions made by the UCSA Board of Directors PERIOD

I think we should work with UCSA on issues but I dont think its beneficial for us to rejoin PERIOD It leaves us with more discretion on issues we would like to focus Cano said PERIOD

Since Lobby Corps became the sole advocacy organization of UC Davis they have focused on a different set of tactics to take advantage of the campus proximity to Sacramento PERIOD

We target small offices and try to get those swing votes that are really important in the passing of a bill said Grace Miller Lobby Corps director of publicity and senior environmental science and management major PERIOD

By refusing UCSA membership UC Davis foregoes several privileges besides lobbying that are afforded to other campuses PERIOD

Lobbying is only one piece of what UCSA does Ellis said PERIOD What Davis is missing out on is having a role in selecting the student Regent and having the ability to appoint members to UCwide committees. after the incidents of police brutality at Berkeley and Davis UCSA has been struggling to find ways to promote the UC Davis student interests despite friction with ASUCD PERIOD

Davis needs to be in the fold so we know how to support them PERIOD For example we werent sure whether a vote of no confidence for the chancellor was for their best interest. ellis said PERIOD Its really awkward to talk about the campus when theyre not at the table. goss points to a more streamlined bureaucracy and a reduction of membership dues as the first steps in reconciling the schism between ASUCD and UCSA PERIOD Currently however many student representatives remain steadfast in their opposition against reviving UCSA membership PERIOD

The UC Davis Law Student Association at King Hall was recently granted membership into UCSA PERIOD They remain the only UC Davis student organization represented in UCSA but this development may signify a trend towards reintegration PERIOD

The LSA joined up and that was really a positive sign because we werent really expecting it Ellis said PERIOD It may be that were making a lot of headway with Davis now. jUSTIN ABRAHAM can be reached at campustheaggie.org PERIOD
