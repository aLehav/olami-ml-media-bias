7716,1970-01-01,"last summer the Oregon womens golf team took a trip down under to the largest island in the world and its humble next door neighbor PERIOD For most of the team it was a chance to see the sights and soak up the sun of Australia and New Zealand PERIOD

But for two Ducks it was a homecoming PERIOD

It was awesome to have the team come home to play our golf courses and meet our families senior cocaptain Kylie Wilson says in her bright New Zealand accent in which team sounds more like tame and golf more like gulf. wilson and fellow senior captain Pam Sowden have traveled a long way to get where they are today  captains of a Pac10 golf team medalists at three tournaments this year playing on some of the most beautiful golf courses in America PERIOD

Theyve represented Oregon and themselves their families and actually their country as great ambassadors head coach Renee Baumgartner said PERIOD

Ryan Starkweather Emerald

Senior Kylie Wilson has also won an individual tourney PERIOD

Now less than a week before Sowden and Wilsons final postseason in Oregon golf shirts the two Auckland natives are at once excited about the postseason and reflective of their time as Ducks PERIOD

For Sowden and Wilson leading the womens golf team has been much more than a position PERIOD The two have captained the team on and off the golf course this year with low scores and positive attitudes PERIOD

Coach always says if we look after ourselves the teams going to benefit as well says Wilson PERIOD

Baumgartner knows what shes talking about PERIOD

In the nine tournaments Oregon played during the regular season Sowden won two individual titles and Wilson won one PERIOD Oregon won all three of those tournaments  the Fall Nittany Lion Invitational the Colby Santa Clara Invitational and the Lady Aztec Invitational PERIOD

Not a lot of Oregon golfers have won tournaments Baumgartner said PERIOD Theyre pretty significant in what theyve meant to Oregon golf. although you might not believe it in the scoresoriented world of Pac10 golf the two captains stress team unity almost as much as low handicaps PERIOD

Its an individual sport but also a team sport Sowden says PERIOD You have to trust your teammates. beyond golf course fences the team eats hangs out and of course takes the occasional trip to Australia together PERIOD

Its like a family Wilson says PERIOD

But before the captains can get too choked up over the end of their Oregon careers there is business to attend to PERIOD For the New Zealanders and fellow seniors Anika Heuser and Angie Rizzo this marks their last postseason as Ducks PERIOD

Well see what happens Sowden says covering her bases on the subject of the Pac10 Championships which start on Monday at the Eugene Country Club PERIOD The Arizona teams are among the best in the country and then USC and Stanford are also pretty tough. despite Sowdens modesty her manner masks a strong desire to win and a confidence in her teammates PERIOD The team has never been in a better position to perform well PERIOD

Weve been having tournaments all year Wilson says PERIOD But these are the finals  both physical and mental. head Coach Renee Baumgartner is in her final year as coach before she focuses solely on her assistant athletic director duties PERIOD She has a team led by Sowden and Wilson of mostly upperclassmen with plenty of experience under their belts PERIOD

Finally as if the golf gods were shining on them two of the three postseason tournaments the Ducks could play are in Oregon PERIOD

Besides the Pac10 Championships next week the NCAA Championships will be held at Sunriver May  through  PERIOD The Ducks need to make the cut at the West Regionals in Tempe Ariz PERIOD May  through  in order to play in Sunriver PERIOD Its a feat they should accomplish PERIOD

Were just going to go out and play our game and add it up at the end Sowden says of the regionals and hope we get our tickets. the Auckland natives represent twothirds of the Oregon roster with NCAA Tournament experience which will no doubt come in handy down the postseason stretch PERIOD Heuser is the only other Duck to have played in the NCAAs PERIOD

It wasnt all fun and sun for Oregon in Australia last summer PERIOD

When the Ducks traveled to New Zealand they played a number of teams including the New Zealand National team which Wilson and Sowden both played for before coming to America PERIOD

It was good Sowden says about playing her former team PERIOD We were playing for the right team. that about sums up the captains views on Oregon PERIOD They may be a long way from home but for the past four years Pam Sowden and Kylie Wilson have been playing for a team they love very much PERIOD The right team PERIOD
