7478,2020-06-30,"taylor Swifts glittering nostalgiafilled  album  was an unadulterated hit PERIOD Bringing her from the landscape of country music to the world of pop it was more than just an album PERIOD The original recording of  collected an endless number of awards most notably the Grammy for  Album of the Year PERIOD

In the pursuit of owning her work from  to  she began rerecording her first albums in  PERIOD She has already released Fearless Taylors Version and Red Taylors Version in  and Speak Now Taylors Version in July of this year PERIOD  Taylors Version marks her fourth of six rerecordings PERIOD

The new recordings have a fresher feel to their production and vocals PERIOD Swifts vocals have grown stronger since  and it adds a new level of depth to the sound PERIOD Additionally the production sounds more befitting of  radios PERIOD

Along with the original tracks the rerecordings also include a vault of unreleased songs from their respective albums PERIOD  Taylors Version included five new songs PERIOD

Slut

The first of the six vault songs Slut surprised most listeners when it was revealed to be a love song PERIOD The dreamy smooth production makes the listener feel as though theyre on a Californian getaway PERIOD

The song plays into Swifts media reputation primarily in the 2010s as a slut. like Blank Space it plays on the fact that she was often portrayed as a serial dater PERIOD Unlike Blank Space she decides that the label is alright so long as the person she is with is the one she is meant to be with PERIOD The label is worth all of it PERIOD

In the song she says that the backlash she faces completely goes away when she is with her partner PERIOD It is thought that the song like most of  is about British pop star Harry Styles who Swift dated in  PERIOD She faced backlash from die hard fans of Styles and his boy band One Direction as did most women who dated the band members PERIOD As someone who was in both spheres of teen pop fandoms I saw my fair share of hatred towards her when she was with Styles PERIOD

The juxtaposing title and overall song message is a wonderful contrast PERIOD It is symbolic of what she was called and who she really was during that time PERIOD

Favorite lyrics Lovelorn and nobody knows Love thorns all over this rose

Say Dont Go

Similarly to Slut the second song is somewhat of a juxtaposition PERIOD Say Dont Go tells the story of complexities in a relationship that result in insecurity and heartbreak PERIOD Despite the depressing lyrics the production is poppy and upbeat PERIOD Jack Antonoffs influence shines on the track with a dancey beat and distinctly 80s feel PERIOD

The chorus consists of Swift asking her partner questions about their failed relationship PERIOD She begs her partner to tell her to stay but as revealed in Suburban Legends she leaves because her partner was too polite to break up with her PERIOD The refrain contrasts any imagery of them together by describing herself alone on either a sidewalk or tightrope and waiting for him PERIOD She ultimately feels vulnerable and her partner does nothing to cure it PERIOD

Her partner in the end leaves her heartbroken and alone PERIOD She ignored possible signs of turmoil I said I love you You say nothin back PERIOD She longs for a connection with her partner again but receives empty gestures instead PERIOD

Favorite lyrics Whyd you whisper in the dark Just to leave me in the night

Now That We Dont Talk

Now That We Dont Talk discusses the aftermath of a relationship falling out PERIOD You cant be friends with that person but you still long to know how they are doing PERIOD In the end you will probably never know but it doesnt stop the hurt PERIOD

I saw a lot of similarities between my first heartbreak and this song PERIOD

The first verse shows Swift curious of how her expartner is doing after a social gathering but knows she will never get an answer PERIOD She goes on to describe the phases he has been through since their split and tells him that he didnt need to change after they parted PERIOD Since they dont talk anymore she has to watch him change just like everyone else does PERIOD She struggles with losing the connection they once had and turns to other means such as calling her mom to vent to cope with the loss PERIOD

Despite the struggles she expresses throughout the song the outro takes an accepting tone PERIOD She realizes she does not have to put up with the things she didnt like in their relationship anymore PERIOD She decides that maybe things for her at least need to be the same way before their relationship PERIOD Just like they were before they dated they know nothing of each other anymore PERIOD And maybe thats okay PERIOD

Favorite lyric I miss the old ways You didnt have to change But I guess I dont have a say Now that we dont talk

Suburban Legends

Like a few other songs in Swifts discography Suburban Legends likens her relationship to a high school couple PERIOD She romanticizes the rocky relationship by imagining them as a high school power couple PERIOD

The song starts with conflict however as her partner is receiving calls from unmarked numbers that she chooses to ignore PERIOD By the bridge we know that they are no longer together despite the fact that she wishes they were PERIOD

Favorite lyrics When you hold me it holds me together And you kiss me in a way thats gonna screw me up forever

Is It Over Now

Is It Over Now is probably my favorite song on this entire album original tracks included PERIOD Sticking to the theme of a tumultuous relationship that ends in disaster the final track on the album talks about the then and now of said relationship PERIOD

The relationship is over and she is watching the aftermath of what has happened between them PERIOD She still imagines him everywhere and knows he is only trying to find a replacement for her PERIOD The song talks about infidelity and questions if their relationship was over when they were with other people PERIOD She wonders if they are only in an off period now or if the relationship is truly over PERIOD

She notices how the new woman her ex is spending time with looks like her and how he seems to be flaunting his new flings while she keeps her romantic life private for his sake PERIOD His new relationships are open for the media to see while hers are simply rumors that cant be proven PERIOD

She also wants him to return to her deep down and discusses harming herself just so he will come running to her aid PERIOD

The song touches on intimate moments pain and betrayal that took place in and out of the relationship PERIOD Despite all of the turmoil she still wants them to find their way back to each other PERIOD In the end the relationship is truly over and she must come to terms with it PERIOD

Favorite lyrics You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor You search in every models bed for somethin greater baby
