5987,2023-07-11,"theres an old joke about an engineer a physicist and a philosopher who end up in Scotland and see a black sheep PERIOD

Sheep here are black says the engineer PERIOD

Some sheep here are black says the physicist PERIOD

One sheep here is black says the philosopher PERIOD Or at least one side is anyway. thats the issue facing psychology at the moment Were assuming all sheep are black based on a limited sample size PERIOD The overwhelming majority of experiments  about  percent  focus on subjects from Western educated industrialized rich and democratic societies and in many cases the conclusions assume the results represent all of humanity PERIOD The problem is that these societies only represent about  percent of the worlds population PERIOD

And many subjects differ from Western societies in surprising ways PERIOD Maybe members of nonindustrialized societies cant solve advanced differential equations but they can probably count their fingers and toes right Not always PERIOD The Piraha people of Brazil cant count to  PERIOD What makes this fact even more confusing is that their word for the number one often refers to a small amount compared to their other counting word which loosely translates to a large amount. even small numbers prove difficult for the Piraha subjects When forced to distinguish between three and four they only succeed about half of the time PERIOD

Theres also the MullerLyer illusion where two identical lines placed next to each other appear to be different lengths because of the oppositefacing arrows on their ends PERIOD The illusion is so strong that short of measuring the two lines with a ruler most Western subjects refuse to believe that the lines are equal lengths PERIOD

But for certain groups culturally separate from us there is no illusion at all PERIOD They see the lines as the same exact length PERIOD For those cultures where there is an effect none experience it as strongly as Americans do PERIOD

Why Researchers think that it may have to do with the straight lines and sharp corners that surround us growing up but that doesnt necessarily sit well especially since the illusion is even more pronounced in children than in adults PERIOD Though Europeans grow up in similar environments and experience the same effect its not as strong as it is in Americans PERIOD

Which shows that even among Western countries theres plenty of variation PERIOD

For instance in the Ultimatum game  a staple for psychological studies looking at how humans cooperate  one player chooses how much money to offer another one PERIOD The second player can either accept the offer in which case both players keep the money or decline it in which case neither player gets anything PERIOD The less you offer the more you can keep but if youre greedy and the other player is resentful you risk losing everything PERIOD

In the U.S. the smartest bet is about  cents PERIOD But in a number of different cultures the best bet is to only offer a dime because other people will more or less accept whatever they are offered PERIOD And some places such as China and Russia as well as Sweden Germany and the Netherlands to a lesser effect show examples of subjects refusing offers that are too high  something that never happens in the U.S PERIOD

None of this is to say that there arent human universals PERIOD All human cultures have language so far as we can tell as well as concepts of right and wrong religious beliefs and gender roles PERIOD But its important to keep in mind that different cultures and environments produce different kinds of people PERIOD

Evolution acts on every part of us including our brains and itd be surprising to find that natural selection hasnt molded our psychology as it has the rest of our bodies PERIOD Before making sweeping generalizations about the entire human race wed better test more than just the small sample that happens to be easiest to study PERIOD
