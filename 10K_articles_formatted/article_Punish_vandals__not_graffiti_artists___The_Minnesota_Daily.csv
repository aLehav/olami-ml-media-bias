Good news for those who want Minneapolis buildings trains and bridge overpasses to be plain and faceless Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton is on your side PERIOD She recently announced a number of new antigraffiti initiatives PERIOD
With support from frustrated businesses and neighborhood groups Minneapolis detectives are gathering more data on graffiti vandals also known as taggers. an investigator in each precinct regularly reports to antigraffiti coordinator Sgt PERIOD Tom Stocke who taggers call Sgt PERIOD Stalker because of his intense nature PERIOD
The citys new plan will build cases against the vandals instead of prosecuting for single incidents PERIOD With proof of damages exceeding  prosecutors will charge taggers with a felony PERIOD
I have no problem with the crackdown as it pertains to the meaningless signature scrawls found on telephones bus stops and buildings PERIOD These childish scribbles driven by a sadly underdeveloped ego do a disservice to more thoughtful street artists PERIOD
Most likely these simple tags not the more timeconsuming pieces that are usually carefully planned and filled with color are responsible for antigraffiti sentiments PERIOD Examples of more complicated works can be seen at the corner of First and Washington avenues downtown or at the Intermedia Arts building on Lyndale Avenue in Uptown PERIOD
Several graffiti artists said their primary goal is to display their art skills for their friends and peers in the graffiti scene not to the general public PERIOD
Toward that end these people paint in outoftheway locations like train yards and other industrial areas PERIOD Because their work takes more time to create the artists must find more remote locations where their works are not visible to many people PERIOD
A question PERIOD If its true as a Canadian Pacific Railroad investigator told the Star Tribune that one side of a train car costs more than  to repaint why do they bother
Maybe their customers dislike colored trains bringing shipments or the railroad management thinks it looks sloppy PERIOD Perhaps as Hennepin County Commissioner Peter McLaughlin said some people are frightened by graffiti PERIOD
They see graffiti as evidence of chaos and lack of control he said PERIOD Thats a message we cant allow to keep having sent out. the names scrawled all over the city cause some to fear gang activity as similar symbols are used to mark territory in heavy gang areas PERIOD But lets not lump those scribbles in with thoughtful timeconsuming paintings that are obviously not threatening PERIOD
The former are seen as signs of urban decay PERIOD But why would a colorful mural lead to negative feelings or fear
It is a shame that people refer to it all as graffiti when the sloppy egoboosting scribbles have little in common with the larger works of art PERIOD
I empathize with the business and property owners whose windows are vandalized and walls covered with the selfish marks of those desperate for an identity PERIOD And although one artist said most who do the larger works also do the simple tags we can at least focus our efforts on the garbage while giving more thoughtful people an outlet PERIOD
Perhaps the authorities can stop graffiti much as they have stopped the smoking of marijuana PERIOD
We should apply a more selective law enforcement paradigm cracking down on individuals who deface public areas and private property but encouraging rather than discouraging industries and railroads to allow artists to paint bare boring surfaces PERIOD
For example in south Minneapolis there is an area known to taggers as the bomb shelter where artists have painted legally for  years PERIOD The owners allowed painting on the back of the building as long as the artists stayed away from the side visible to the public PERIOD
Recently a graffiti artist known as Wire painted there for more than three hours creating a large rendition of his artist name PERIOD These works are more colorful and appealing to my eye than a plain wall could ever be PERIOD
But painting at the bomb shelter is now offlimits PERIOD Sgt PERIOD Stocke claimed the area is a fire hazard and the owners originally made the agreement out of fear PERIOD
Perhaps the most truthful reason for the change is Stockes belief that allowing the taggers to practice on a free wall lets them refine their work before targeting illegal surfaces. oh no Not more refined work
Aside from the aesthetics debate there is a theory that says tolerance of these quality of life crimes which include graffiti property damage and prostitution leads to tolerance of more serious personal crimes PERIOD
In other words the police and the public will start to tolerate people assaulting each other because of the numbing effects of vandalism I dont buy it PERIOD
Nor do vandals represent a shady population of gateway criminals who start with graffiti and move on to robbery PERIOD Rather from what Ive seen the majority of the painters are peaceful even following an unwritten code of conduct PERIOD For example one rule prohibits a painter from going over anothers work unless he has prepared a more spectacular piece PERIOD
Graffiti artists should not be allowed to paint at the expense of others PERIOD But its too bad the city with its fearinducing rhetoric has pressured businesses to join with them in their crusade to clamp down on the more creative and skilled works of art PERIOD
Those who honestly want a place to paint as opposed to the adrenaline rush of doing something taboo would do well to distance themselves from the thoughtless scribbles reminiscent of dog markings PERIOD
As for the rest of us rather than taking for granted that we dont like graffiti we should distinguish between harmless displays of creativity and human spirit and the worthless scrawls that have made certain areas an ugly blight PERIOD
Next time youre driving ask yourself which you really prefer a free splash of color that represents someones desire to make something beautiful or a blank bridge to drive through PERIOD
