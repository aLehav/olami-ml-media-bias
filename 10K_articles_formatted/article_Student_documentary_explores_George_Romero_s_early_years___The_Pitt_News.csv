George Romero  Pittsburgh The Early Years a 45minute documentary produced by Pitt students as part of their Making the Documentary course screened in a Zoom event Thursday night PERIOD The film focused on Romeros beginning from his birth in Brooklyn to his move to Pittsburgh where he found the group that would go on to be his main collaborators for his early films PERIOD

By  Matthew Monroy Senior Staff Writer February  

Pitt has countless departments devoted to research from scientific stem cell experiments to historical inquiries PERIOD But for the students of last years Making the Documentary course constructing a film can be just as valuable a form of academic research as experiments done in a lab PERIOD

The spring  class which Carl Kurlander senior lecturer of film  media studies taught allowed students to hone their film production skills on one of Pittsburghs most famous filmmakers  George Romero PERIOD The result of the class is a 45minute documentary George Romero  Pittsburgh The Early Years directed produced written and edited by Pitt students PERIOD

The finished project screened in a Zoom event Thursday night followed by a discussion with the student filmmakers and Kurlander moderated by Lori Cardille star of Romeros  film Day of the Dead. the film focuses on Romeros beginning from his birth in the Bronx to his move to Pittsburgh where he found the group that would come to be his main collaborators for his early films PERIOD

The students also worked in conjunction with the University Library System which acquired the Romero Archive in  to incorporate footage from Romeros early films into the documentary PERIOD Adam Lowenstein a professor of English and film  media studies and director of the newly formed Horror Studies Working Group originally pitched the idea of a Romero documentary to Kurlander and was consulted for the film PERIOD The film showcases both scholarly research skills and film production techniques and according to Lowenstein is a testament to film as a tool for research PERIOD

We dont necessarily think about making a film as a research project Lowenstein said PERIOD But I think that this is a project that really demonstrates how much making a documentary involves research and how productive that research can be. the students research took them from Romeros early days shooting segments for Mister Rogers Neighborhood to the production of his groundbreaking  classic Night of the Living Dead. often hailed as the kickstarter of the zombie horror genre the film shocked audiences with its levels of gore and grotesqueness heightened by the lowbudget homemovie aesthetic PERIOD

But the film was historic in more ways than one PERIOD The films steelyeyed protagonist Ben was played by Duane Jones a Pitt alumnus and Black man PERIOD The casting of a nonwhite actor for a leading role in such a pioneering film was unconventional by 1960s standards but it was the films shocking ending in which Ben is shot and killed by an allwhite militia who believe him to be a zombie that cemented its transcendent legacy PERIOD

The movie was released in October  just nine months after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr PERIOD Although MLK died after the films production Lowenstein said it was hard for his death not to have an impact on peoples readings of the ending PERIOD

It was a big reason why the film had such a cultural impact he said PERIOD Everyone who saw that film in  would be thinking about MLKs assassination when Ben is killed  the film reminds us that the zombie threat is not so otherworldly. although Jones performance has gained reverence amongst Romero fans and film circles Lowenstein noted during the virtual event that Jones opted for a career out of the limelight postNight of the Living Dead taking roles in avantgarde and dramatic films such as Ganja  Hess and Losing Ground and eventually devoting his career to teaching and directing theater before his death in  PERIOD

In an attempt to recognize his underappreciated legacy Suz Romero Georges widow and founder and president of the George A PERIOD Romero Foundation presented Marva Jones Brooks Duanes sister with the foundations Pioneer Award in his honor PERIOD

Exploring Jones legacy and studying the zombie genre was a highlight for Molly Goodheart a senior English literature major and lifelong Romero superfan PERIOD She served as the main interviewer for the documentary and described the opportunity to talk to Romeros closest friends and collaborators as a dream come true PERIOD

It was surreal getting to ask behindthescenes questions to people I have admired my whole life she said PERIOD

Although the class began with the assumption that the students would have access to all handson materials and resources for conducting interviews the COVID19 pandemics shutdown of inperson classes in March completely disrupted the class forcing the students to improvise and trade their cameras for Zoom webcams PERIOD Laura Stravach an undeclared sophomore said her role as producer for the documentary became much more difficult with the switch to online collaboration PERIOD

You go from being able to storyboard in person and take home footage on hard drives to being spread out at home she said PERIOD Its really hard to do really good teamwork working virtually. with Night of the Living Dead and the rest of his filmography Romero found in horror an instrument for wielding sharp social commentary reflecting the worlds inhumanity into his malformed night stalkers PERIOD Lowenstein pointed out his influence in elevating an entire genre from being regarded as a childish silly endeavor to an insightful mode whose impact extends to modernday horror films PERIOD Lowenstein who devoted his academic career to affirming horror as a form worthy of study said Romero created an entire cinematic language thats still being replicated today PERIOD

Everything we see from zombie films all over the world they all adhere to a set of rules and themes and tropes and metaphors  theyre all speaking Georges language he said PERIOD Its really an incredible thing that a film made more than  years ago still has that kind of hold on the popular imagination and not just in this country but in the world. join our newsletter
