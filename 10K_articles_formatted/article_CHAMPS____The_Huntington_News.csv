BROOKLINE  Finally they can call themselves champions PERIOD

Spurred by a staunch defense that forced seven turnovers against an overwhelmed Dukes offense the Northeastern football team   Atlantic10 earned its first ever conference title with a  thumping over James Madison PERIOD

Senior defensive end Steve Anzalone forced two fumbles and recovered another while Sophomore standout Liam Ezekiel returned an interception  yards for a score PERIOD Not to be outdone was defensive lineman Dave Williams who returned a fumble  yards for another defensive touchdown PERIOD NUs defense has scored seven times this season PERIOD

Its easy to start looking ahead and feeling elation said Northeastern coach Don Brown who will be appearing in the IAA postseason for the first time ever as a head coach PERIOD When I saw them come out to practice Tuesday I knew we werent done PERIOD

We scored on defense and achieved all the goals that we had for the regular season. junior running back Tim Gale led the offensive charge gaining  yards on the ground during the windy afternoon affair PERIOD

JMU starting quarterback was under siege all afternoon which forced him into a 3for12 passing game with two interceptions and only  yards passing PERIOD

Maine also won on Saturday earning a share of the conference title PERIOD But since William and Mary lost and UMass won Northeastern won the league tiebreaker over Maine giving them the automatic bid to the NCAA playoffs PERIOD

Were for real Brown said PERIOD Watch the way we handles ourselves over the last couple of weeks. senior cornerback Art Smith agreed PERIOD

This is the best thing that ever happened PERIOD It had to happen and we proved it he said PERIOD
