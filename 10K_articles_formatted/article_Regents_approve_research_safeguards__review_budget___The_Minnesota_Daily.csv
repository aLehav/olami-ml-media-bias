The University of Minnesotas Board of Regents has approved steps the school plans to take to better protect research participants PERIOD

Regents approved dozens of steps Friday the University will take to bolster its human research protections after it was blasted in two reports that were released earlier this year PERIOD The new safeguards will cost the University about nearly  million in the first year and almost . million each year after that PERIOD

The changes are expected to take up to one year to fully implement PERIOD

Among the new policies are requirements are a beefedup institutional review board the creation of a community oversight board and preventing researchers from collecting fees from companies that sponsor their research PERIOD

The reports were the culmination of more than a decade of scrutiny brought on after the  suicide of research study enrollee Dan Markingson PERIOD

While Mike Howard a family friend of Markingsons mother Mary Weiss said the University seems sincere in its intentions he is frustrated it took so long to address concerns over the schools research practices PERIOD

Dan didnt need to die for this to happen he said PERIOD This shouldve happened on its own years ago. higher tuition looms

The board also reviewed President Eric Kalers proposed budget for next year which includes tuition increases of up to  percent PERIOD

If approved by the board on June  tuition would jump by . percent for resident undergraduates and  percent for outofstate undergraduates PERIOD Instate graduate and professional students would see a . percent increase on average PERIOD

But Regent Michael Hsu said he thinks extending a tuition freeze to instate residents is still possible PERIOD

I would like to see a freeze for Minnesota residents  with internal savings Hsu said at a board meeting Friday PERIOD

University Chief Financial Officer Richard Pfutzenreuter said at the meeting it would take . million of reallocation to extend a freeze PERIOD

Throughout this years legislative session Kaler said tuition would spike unless legislators gave the University  million it said was needed to freeze tuition PERIOD Lawmakers ended up allocating about  million to the school to freeze costs PERIOD

Under the proposed plan an increase in financial aid will offset tuition increases for about  percent of instate undergraduates Kaler said at the meeting PERIOD
