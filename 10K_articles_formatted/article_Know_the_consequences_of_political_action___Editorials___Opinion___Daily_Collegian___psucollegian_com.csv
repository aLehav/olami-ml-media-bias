759,1970-01-01,"following the election of President Donald Trump new protests and movements have seemingly popped up every week PERIOD

On every major political issue ranging from womens rights to the United States relationship with Russia thousands have joined in solidarity to resist the actions of the Trump Administration PERIOD

Its not just the naysayers PERIOD In addition those in support of the actions and promises of our current president have been vocal as well as evidenced by the prolife March for Life protest that took place in January PERIOD Protest isnt necessarily only restricted to marching on the street or standing on a corner with a sign  there is a strong online presence of protests as well PERIOD Petitions news articles and social media constantly circulate on the internet taking every stance on every topic that divides Americans PERIOD

Last Thursday many of Americas workers participated in a Day Without Immigrants protest wherein immigrants took a day off from work and marched in cities across the country PERIOD The ultimate goal was to demonstrate the economic contributions of immigrants as the United States faces tough reform on immigration laws PERIOD

Upon returning to work on Friday morning several immigrants reported that they had lost their jobs as a result of their participation in the protests PERIOD While some Americans reacted in disgust to this its important to note that many of the employers of these immigrants were not against the cause but opposed to their employees leaving without much notice PERIOD Being vocal about what matters to you in todays America is more important than ever seeing how most of the American public is deeply divided on almost every major issue PERIOD

Pushing for change on certain issues and exercising your right to free speech is something everyone should be able to take advantage of PERIOD

But when engaging in any political potentially polarizing act whether it be a march or posting certain opinions on Facebook your actions and statements may have important repercussions to think about PERIOD

Not everyone will applaud your choices and there may be results of your political activism that you are not exempt from simply because it was a cause that mattered to you PERIOD

At the next protest at Allen Street gates or the next time youre posting about politics online remember the outcome and really think about whether politically engaging in certain ways is worth it PERIOD
