Some majors offered by the University are interdisciplinary meaning that they require an understanding from not one but multiple fields of study PERIOD University academic departments recognize the importance of reaching out to other disciplines but when proposals are made to merge colleges together we have to wonder if both sides will benefit mutually PERIOD

So where do we draw the line

Well its a delicate one PERIOD On one side the merged colleges can continue to operate and offer courses at the University PERIOD The alternative is that one school loses its identity by becoming a smaller unit within a larger generally more prestigious program PERIOD

Thats where University administrators and top labor officials are at odds PERIOD

The Daily Illini reported last week that University officials are considering pushing through a proposal that would merge the School of Labor and Employment Relations with the College of Business or another larger college PERIOD



It would be a long and laborious process to the say the least requiring the proposal to be pushed through an UrbanaChampaign Senate subcommittee the University Board of Trustees and various University offices PERIOD

But we believe its a change worth pursuing PERIOD

Provost Ilesanmi Adesida told the House Economic Development Committee in midOctober that the University is looking for new options that would help the more than 60yearold school expand and continue to attract toptier students PERIOD

However Michael Carrigan president of the states AFLCIO union said the merger could mean that fewer union members will participate in the program PERIOD Another fear is that LER will lose its identity and be outshined by the College of Business which houses several highly ranked programs already PERIOD

But LER already has a history of success PERIOD No formal national ranking system exists for labor schools so LER can only stand to benefit to be associated with programs that are ranked PERIOD

Employers consistently acknowledge that LER ranks in the upper echelon  at least in the topthree PERIOD And the education it provides whether in human resources or managing unions has an indelible place in the real world especially as laborrelated issues and workplaces evolve across the country even more so around the world PERIOD

But for that history to continue merging with Business could prove useful PERIOD LER needs to be able to focus on whats most important continuing to attract topnotch students for its graduate programs PERIOD

To increase LERs masters degree enrollment campus spokeswoman Robin Kaler said that LER needs campus support and a larger infrastructure to do that. over the past five years the masters degree enrollment numbers have fluctuated between  and  PERIOD

Without a longterm foundation we remain concerned for the future LER a school most necessary in todays business and labor landscape PERIOD

The program should continue to be offered as long as the University is operational but to do that LER must realign with a strong partner with an even stronger presence the College of Business PERIOD

Business top priority if merged may not necessarily be the School of Labor and Employment Relations but it will bring stability to a program that can and should be recognized nationwide PERIOD","For its future, School of Labor and Employment Relations must merge with Business - The Daily Illini",University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
