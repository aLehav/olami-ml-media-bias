NYU Law students continued their protests against scholar in residence Harold Koh on Wednesday morning staging a demonstration on the corner of Washington Square South and Sullivan Street outside of the NYU School of Law PERIOD

Koh is currently teaching international human rights at NYU Law. march a group of NYU Law students released a statement criticizing Kohs role in providing some of the legal rationale for President Barack Obamas targeted drone strike program while acting as Legal Adviser of the State Department from  to  PERIOD Koh has been a vocal supporter of the drone program drawing scrutiny from those working in human rights PERIOD

Given Mr PERIOD Kohs role in crafting and defending what objectively amounts to an illegal and inhumane program of extrajudicial assassinations and potential war crimes we find his presence at NYU Law and in particular as a professor of International Human Rights Law to be unacceptable the Statement of No Confidence reads PERIOD

On Wednesday six protesters including three NYU Law students handed out flyers to anyone who would take them PERIOD The demonstration included the a lifesized model drone PERIOD

Columbia Law student Shan Khan one of the people handing out flyers said he felt it takes a lot of courage for NYU students to stand up and make a statement PERIOD

There might be only a couple of us standing out here but we dont feel comfortable with the status quo where you can have these institutional figures that have such power go and be a part of something that a lot of us feel are war crimesonly to come back and teach humanrights as if there is no glaring contradiction there Khan said PERIOD

Amanda Bass an NYU Law student who helped organize the demonstration said the protesters are not critical of Koh because of his ideas but because of his actions within the U.S PERIOD government PERIOD

Whats at issue is his role and his action as legal adviser in providing the legal defense for the Obama administrations targeted killing program Bass said PERIOD

The Statement of No Confidence prompted backlash from NYU faculty members as well as Kohs colleagues PERIOD More than  people including current and past students of Kohs signed an open letter supporting him calling the movement against him misguided. koh released a statement in which he said he appreciated how much support he received from both inside and outside the NYU community PERIOD

Im very moved by the outpouring of support Ive received from such a broad spectrum Kohs statement reads PERIOD Ive truly enjoyed my visit to NYU and have had many thoughtful conversations with many NYU students especially my human rights class which has taught me a lot about many hard questions. koh added that he wished those who had a problem with him had spoken directly to him PERIOD

Bass admitted that the group has not talked to Koh but said because Kohs position on the drone program has been very public and well known they did not feel a need to PERIOD

In terms of understanding the legal arguments that he put forward we have a lot of information about the role that he played Bass said PERIOD For us it was not useful to actually sit down and talk to him when were taking issue not with the reasons for why he may have done what he did but with his concrete actions in his time in government. the group told WSN it plans to hold demonstrations the next two Wednesdays PERIOD
