After advancing all the way to the Frozen Four the last two seasons only to be sent packing after the first game Michigan junior Andy Burnes has learned one thing PERIOD

Looking back at the last two years now making it to the Frozen Four is nothing  just being there is nothing Burnes said PERIOD

The Wolverines are no longer satisfied with just getting to the Frozen Four  they want to take the next step PERIOD They said the difference between playing for the ultimate prize or going home as just a semifinalist for the third straight year will be the opening minutes of Thursdays game against Minnesota PERIOD

In both last years loss to the Gohpers and its  loss to Boston Collge Michigan trailed from the first period PERIOD

I think it all comes down to our start captain Jed Ortmeyer said.The last two years we put ourselves into a hole the first  minutes of the game PERIOD We came back and I felt like we might have controlled the game from that point in the game but we were too far in a hole. the importance of a good first period could be magnified Thursday because Minnesota has opened up early leads in its last four games PERIOD

Thats good  its good for a wake up call for our team coach Red Berenson said PERIOD The whole game could be on the line in the first five minutes PERIOD So we need to be ready for that. michigans upperclassmen have all been to the Frozen Four twice and just the freshmen and goaltender Chris Gartman have never been there so that experience could help the Wolverines be ready to play as soon as the puck drops PERIOD Also the team has been focusing on being mentally prepared and brushing aside any distractions PERIOD

Much has been made of Michigans senior leadership lately and Burnes said he thinks that leadership will help the rest of the team stay focused PERIOD

And getting another crack at the team that ousted them last year could give the Wolverines a little bit of extra motivation PERIOD

Last years game is in the back of our head Burnes said PERIOD Nobody forgets the feeling of losing after being right there on the doorstep PERIOD Its a terrible feeling and you dont forget the tears you shed. both Ortmeyer and Burnes said Michigan has a different attitude going into the weekend than in the past two years PERIOD

Weve got just one goal in our minds and it starts Thursday night Burnes said PERIOD Our first goal is to put ourselves in a position to win a National Championship. please consider donating to The Michigan Daily
