Darren Aronofsky is doubtlessly one of the most talented filmmakers still active today. with stellar titles like Pi and Requiem for a Dream that earned him world acclaim the bar is set pretty high. though his third movie The Fountain was met with less than spectacular reviews his newest endeavor The Wrestler is a masterpiece. the film has only been screened a handful of times at film festivals around the world winning the Golden Lion in Venice and most recently closing the forty-sixth annual New York Film Festival PERIOD

In an Oscarworthy performance that trumps anything he has done in the past Mickey Rourke plays aging wrestler Randy The Ram Robinson nearing the end of both his career and his life. rourke the focus of the entire film receives excellent support from Marisa Tomei as a stripper named Cassidy and Evan Rachel Wood as his daughter with whom hes lost touch. both actresses perform their parts excellently though in scenes with Rourke they are often eclipsed by his performance PERIOD

The film is intensely raw and honest with Aronofsky flexing his documentary muscles in many of the wrestling scenes. the cinematography helmed by Maryse Alberti instead of Aronofskys usual Matthew Libatique uses plenty of handheld camera but not to the point of jarring the viewer. this is especially effective during long tracking shots and the wrestling matches. there are also static long shots reminiscent of the boardwalk scenes in Requiem for a Dream. the absence of some Aronofsky staples might make some fans anxious but rest assured that the film is still magnificent. youll recognize character actor Mark Margolis who has been in every one of Aronofskys films and Clint Mansell who did the musicthough its far less predominant and integral than the soundtracks for Requiem and Fountain. if you enjoyed any of Aronofskys work you must see this film. its a logical progression and evolution of his talents as a director completely up to the high standard he set for himself in his previous three works PERIOD The Wrestler will see commercial release on Dec PERIOD nineteenth and anyone with any interest in film owes it to themself to see it as soon as the opportunity presents itself PERIOD",Mickey Rourke Shines in Aronofsky’s Latest Film  – The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
