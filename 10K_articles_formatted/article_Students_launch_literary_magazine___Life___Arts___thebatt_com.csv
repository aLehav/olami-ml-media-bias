For the artist the world is drawn in thick black lines that simply need to be colored in PERIOD Margins in a biology notebook are not empty and stale but instead waiting for their lines to be crossed and covered with verses of poetry PERIOD

The unsung artists of AM have a new outlet with which to share their creative works in The Eckleburg Project AMs newest literary magazine PERIOD The magazine was created by eight students who say the purpose of the project is to open the door for a greater appreciation of the arts PERIOD

The new student run and written magazine sponsored by the University Writing Center is accepting submissions from creative writers photographers and artists for its first issue PERIOD

The Eckleburg Project will be important for AM students because right now there are few mediums on campus through which authors and artists alike have the opportunity to express themselves said Amanda Yanes senior psychology and English double major and editorinchief of the magazine PERIOD I think that art in all its forms is important PERIOD Not only because it is beautiful but because it contains answers or poses questions that only the artist has PERIOD In short art teaches PERIOD

The Eckleburg Project takes its name from the pages of F PERIOD Scott Fitzgeralds The Great Gatsby where the eyes of Dr PERIOD T.J PERIOD Eckleburg look down from a billboard at the world PERIOD

We took this symbol and put our own spin on it Yanes said PERIOD Part of the job of writers is to examine their surroundings to see the world around them and then through art tell a truth about what they see PERIOD We picked Dr PERIOD Eckleburgs eyes as our namesake because we want the authors of AM to tell us what they see PERIOD

The staff is composed of Yanes as editorinchief two fiction editors two poetry editors a head of design and two publicists PERIOD

AM is a great University but one that lacks in opportunities for creative majors to think and express themselves said Madison Parker senior English major and publicist PERIOD The magazine is a great tool to allow creative Aggies to express themselves and provide a more wellrounded experience to all those who pick up the magazine even if they are not artistically minded PERIOD

Shannon Bump senior psychology major and head of design said she knew she wanted to get involved as soon as she heard about The Eckleburg Project PERIOD

I knew Id found people that thought the way I do felt the way I do and immersed themselves in words the way I do Bump said PERIOD The Project isnt just a bunch of words on paper its the souls of our Aggies written down put in print and exposed for all the world to see PERIOD

Allison Mock freshman English major and poetry editor said the liberal arts are a much bigger part of the world than some people realize PERIOD

We are the basis of our culture Mock said PERIOD One day we will become the Shakespeares the Austens the Brontes the Fitzgeralds PERIOD We could be the Dalis the Warhols the DaVincis PERIOD Whatever we may be we are history in the making PERIOD

The goal of the magazine is to give a voice to an otherwise almost unheard group on campus PERIOD

I want to stand up for the creative writers the artists the photographers and all the people that often fly under the radar on campus said Amanda HendrixBlack senior English major and fiction editor PERIOD The Eckleburg Project is a force of creative freedom and Im so proud to be a part of making it all happen PERIOD
