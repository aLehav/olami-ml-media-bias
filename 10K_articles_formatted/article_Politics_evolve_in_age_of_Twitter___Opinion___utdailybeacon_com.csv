THIS IS WHAT I THINK PERIOD Its a shrewd largelyuniversal observation about a particular topic or society in general PERIOD Your day and life will be better because of it and per my aptitude for educating the masses its entirely probable that Ill dispense at least one more datum like it before bedtime PERIOD Also the idea behind this thought was far too labyrinthine to be contained to  characters but I did it anyway cause Im clever. i wish I were as honest when I tweet as I am when I evaluate my own tweeting habits but such is social media PERIOD Its an interesting dynamic really  in the world of Twitter I like my semienlightenedyetstilltweetingforsomereason contemporaries am compelled to constantly exhibit myself on my best terms possible and am given a forum to do just that so you know  why not



The brevity of the whole thing is cool PERIOD Twitter founder Jack Dorsey chose the term twitter for its definition  a short burst of inconsequential information which he and his creative staff likened to a bird chirping hence the present logo PERIOD It was just perfect  Thats exactly what the product was Dorsey said PERIOD



Yeah PERIOD But given its creators acknowledgment of the site as a sort of illegitimate means of substantive communication I cant help but still regard Twitter exactly as I did when I first discovered it back in   as little more than a novelty and little less than the epitome of egoism PERIOD Sure the website has plenty of practical wholesome andor altruistic applications now including but not limited to Egyptian revolution and realtime updates of  whatever but that doesnt change the fact that it began as a condensed version of Facebooks status the absolute most narcissistic thing in social media PERIOD



A tweet regardless of content is based on the voice of each accounts operator and on what that person thinks or wants PERIOD So aside from activists idiots those who follow exclusively on Twitter and those who relate to other human beings in the most terse manner possible anyway  introverts mutes girls who communicate verbally in Internet slanguage lol omg smh etc. the only people populating Twitter are those seeking some kind of attention PERIOD



Similarly we follow because selfpromotion is only half the appeal PERIOD The other half is the sites bitesized nature  Twitter gives us a piece of information in two seconds and provides it devoid of pomp frill or extraneousness not immediately critical to the topic at hand PERIOD If details are necessary there might be a link to a news outlets website or something but that information is optional not caked around the absolute most strippeddown representation of the issue PERIOD



Its a microcosm of the newest information globalization in which only the purest form of an idea is given regard PERIOD The past two decades have forged a cultural shift in the information realm by which weve come to consistently expect data in miniature form PERIOD Our generation likes to get the picture and move on and we dont have the time capacity or focus to engage anything that takes more than a few seconds PERIOD Incidentally this is why reports have abstracts newscasts have soundbites and books have Cliffnotes PERIOD The causeeffect of the whole thing is really pretty simple As modernity augments our capacity to do more say more learn more and think more our attention span shrinks PERIOD



As sad as it may be this trend has significant realworld implications PERIOD Take campaign politics for instance PERIOD A candidates job is to convey a message and convince a body of voters that that message is consistent with their interests but how is this possible when the voters tune out after  seconds Many politicians have taken to the mainstream by actually setting up Twitter accounts through which they can communicate with their constituents but does this really help on the campaign trail Do speeches need to be limited to  seconds What about debates for which this is kind of already the case Are we fast moving toward an era of halfhourlong National Conventions Whoever heard someone complain about a speech being too short anyway



Whatever the case its an everchanging reality PERIOD The influence of Twitter and all things similar might be undermining substantive discourse and mitigating the power of intelligent rhetoric but its becoming more and more the lay of the land and a politicians job as a public official is to adapt to it PERIOD Obviously theres no bythebook remedy for adapting to social politics but politicians are making moves to engage the problem PERIOD The only question is are they strategizing successfully Smell That next week PERIOD
