7972,2023-09-20,"for some outofstate students who call Texas home Saturdays matchup is a chance to let their old and new traditions meet and get a taste of home in their new environment PERIOD For others the game could be a test of their loyalties as they cheer on both the Aggies and the Tide PERIOD

Brent Bielefeldt a junior majoring in mechanical engineering is not a Texas AM fan but is excited for chance to be included in new rivalries that outofstate students sometimes miss out on PERIOD

When you go out of state you arent really a part of the rivalries that your friends who went to state schools have so its really cool to start a new rivalry with AM because youre more included in it he said PERIOD

Caroline Spillane a freshman majoring in dance was excited when AM joined the SEC even though it meant leaving behind traditional rivals like the University of Texas PERIOD

Its weird to think AM wont be playing UT anymore but Im excited that theyre going to play bigger schools she said PERIOD I think AM is going to be a stronger team because theyll have to fight for their titles. the AM game will offer Texas students the opportunity to experience traditions old and new PERIOD Spillane has taken the opportunity to share her new culture with friends at AM PERIOD Spillane said UA traditions like Homecoming Week have a more Southern feel but AM traditions like yell practice and chugging a beer to get your class ring are just a strong PERIOD

Texas is my home and Alabama is my new home so its like meshing the two together Spillane said PERIOD AM has strong traditions but we UA have strong traditions in a different way. bielefeldt has also used AMs entrance into the SEC to teach his friends back home about UA traditions PERIOD

You learn a lot about traditions growing up because you see them everywhere so its cool to see AM bring their traditions to the SEC and introduce my friends that go to AM to a lot of our traditions. the large population of Texas students at the University of Alabama has the potential to change the feeling of the student section but Bielefeldt and Spillane believe while they might feel more connected to this game most Texans will be pulling for the Tide PERIOD

Though Spillane and Bielefeldt will be cheering for Alabama not all Texans will let school affiliation totally trump lifelong state loyalty PERIOD Houston native Katie Bayless a junior majoring in chemical engineering is a lifelong Texas AM fan PERIOD She will be sporting both AM maroon and an Alabama button on Saturday to reconcile her two fandoms PERIOD

Bayless is optimistic about about how AM will perform on Saturday and plans to enjoy the game no matter what the outcome PERIOD

I am very excited to see AM come to Alabama PERIOD I feel like it is going to be a good game she said PERIOD

Bayless whose parents both attended Texas AM is excited to participate in AM traditions like yell practice a pep rally where an elite group known as Yell Captains teach AM cheers PERIOD More than anything Bayless is excited to experience a taste of home and enjoy both of her teams PERIOD

Honestly I dont care who wins as long as it is a good and close game Bayless said PERIOD","A&M game offers Texas students change to experience new, old traditions â€“ The Crimson White",University of Alabama
