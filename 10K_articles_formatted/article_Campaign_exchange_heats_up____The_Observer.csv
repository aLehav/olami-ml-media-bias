Megan ONeil  Friday January  

Midway through their campaigns Saint Marys student body presidential and vice presidential candidates tried to win over voters Thursday by fielding students questions on everything from past leadership experience to the Colleges relationship with Notre Dame PERIOD

The exchange between presidential hopeful and current student body vice president Susan McIlduff and running mate Maggie Seifert and opposing candidates Amanda Shropshire and Annie Davis was largely congenial as the tickets outlined intended changes and highlighted personal attributes PERIOD

McIlduff emphasized her role as president of the Student Academic Counsel while saying one of her main goals if elected would be to improve students selection of and enrollment in courses by making all course requirements available to students prior to registration PERIOD McIlduff also hopes to examine adding and dropping classes a process she called frustrating and cumbersome PERIOD

I feel that the adddrop process is very inefficient McIlduff said PERIOD Currently if you want to add or drop a course you have to have not only the professor sign off but also the head of the department. shropshire said her first priority would be to tighten student government and clarify officers roles PERIOD She said she intends to provide guidance on details such as how to run a formal meeting PERIOD

A lot of people this year had no idea what they were doing Shropshire said PERIOD It probably isnt just a product of this year PERIOD It probably has been building for a long time. shropshire also said she would modify Board of Governance BOG meetings to increase their efficiency PERIOD

I think some people have a reason they joined BOG and they have some things they want to get done  One thing I would change would be limiting the number of questions that go on during the cosponsorship proposals Shropshire said PERIOD There have been many times when it has gone over and people are sitting there not really interested. when asked about how she would manage any conflict that arose between herself and Siefert McIlduff said she would address it openly and directly PERIOD

Even if it is going to Dalloways and having a cup of coffee and saying what my pet peeve is with Maggie and what her pet peeve is with me McIlduff said PERIOD

Both McIlduff and Davis highlighted their work with Volunteers in Support of Admission VISA  Davis is president and McIlduff is a volunteer  as evidence of their efforts to address the issue of enrollment at the College PERIOD

While giving tours to high school seniors Davis said she is often asked about the relationship between Saint Marys and Notre Dame PERIOD

What I tell them is that Notre Dame is across the street if they want it but Saint Marys is its own family and its own community and we take care of each other Davis said PERIOD Even though Notre Dame is a great school Saint Marys is just as great and it always been just as great PERIOD We are just left out sometimes. interaction with Notre Dame has long been important to the College and will continue to be so in the future Seifert said PERIOD

We are the sister school of Notre Dame whether there are girls at Notre Dame or not Seifert said PERIOD We have to remember we are Saint Marys and we take pride in that but we need to stay connected with Notre Dame. if elected president McIlduff said she hopes to reach out to students and be a visible presence on campus  something she wished she emphasized more as vice president during the past year PERIOD

When asked how she would address issues of diversity such as last years Pride Week Tshirt McIlduff said she would default to the best resources on campus PERIOD

I would look to the Student Diversity Board the president of SDB is best able to handle it  I would also turn to Terri Johnson in the Office of Multicultural Affairs PERIOD She is great and she comes from both sides of the issue McIlduff said PERIOD

In one of the more provocative questions posed the candidates were asked to comment on their opponents strengths and critique their weaknesses PERIOD McIlduff and Shropshire offered only compliments however lauding each others dedication to the College PERIOD

Amanda is a very passionate person McIlduff said PERIOD She is passionate about student government and constantly puts in long hours. shropshire praised McIlduffs outgoing nature PERIOD

Susan is very personable  It is probably one of her best qualities Shropshire followed PERIOD She doesnt hold back on getting to know people and peoples issues. during the meeting Shropshire and Davis reiterated their determination to address the

little things on campus such as laundry prices and lounge furniture PERIOD They also pledged to take on a big student complaint parking PERIOD

We want to get the parking ticket issue handled Shropshire said PERIOD A lot of people have been complaining about how many tickets they have been getting for parking somewhere for five minutes. when asked how she would determine or define a successful term McIlduff said such judgment would ultimately have to be made in hindsight PERIOD

I would look back just to see if our main goals were accomplished McIlduff said PERIOD If I feel I have tried my hardest I would feel as though I had done a successful job. voting will take place Monday on Prism from  a.m PERIOD to midnight PERIOD Results will be released Tuesday morning PERIOD
