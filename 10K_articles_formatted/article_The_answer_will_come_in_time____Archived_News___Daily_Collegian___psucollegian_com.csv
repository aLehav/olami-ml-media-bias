Sometimes as much as we want to know everything as soon as possible theres just no way to accurately assess what were seeing PERIOD

Sometimes in the thick of the season when every up or down frames and reframes our opinions of a player or team its helpful to step back for a moment and look at the bigger picture PERIOD So with objectivity and the long run in mind lets look at what weve seen over the past five weeks PERIOD

Think back to a month ago back to those hours before kickoff against Akron in the downpour that soaked Beaver Stadium PERIOD Remember those questions you had back then

Would the offensive line perform well with four new starters

Would the secondary be able to play at a level fans have grown accustomed to seeing from a Penn State defense

Was there any chance the defensive line could stack up to last seasons front four

Was Anthony Morelli capable of effectively leading this offense

Well a month later the clearcut answer to the first three questions is  with varying degrees of enthusiasm depending upon how much of an optimist you are PERIOD

The offensive line has exceeded expectations the past four games after looking lost in the opener against the Zips and their  defensive front PERIOD In fact the line has been so stable that it did not miss a beat Saturday with two new starters PERIOD

Aside from a few hiccups against Notre Dame a team that boasts one of the nations best passing attacks the defensive backfield has been reliable at the very least PERIOD

With seniors Jay Alford and Ed Johnson this years defensive line is probably stronger in the middle than the  version but Tamba Halis pass rushing ability from the outside is definitely missed PERIOD

In terms of yards allowed per game Penn State ranks nineteenth in the country  not bad for a unit that welcomed six players with no prior starting experience especially considering the Nittany Lions have already faced two Heismanquality quarterbacks PERIOD

But its the fourth question which can be termed the  that remains unanswered PERIOD The junior quarterback had his best game of the season on Saturday but still the boos rained down at times PERIOD

The coaches allowed him to throw the ball downfield which he did well but there were still long passes that would have been better if not thrown at all PERIOD

Morelli now has more interceptions five than touchdown passes four PERIOD What he also now has judging by the play calling Saturday is the confidence of his coaches PERIOD

Never before has Morelli been allowed to air it out so often as he did against the Wildcats finally throwing the ball down the field and showcasing his arm PERIOD

 Morelli said PERIOD 

And though it wont make the highlight reels like his completions of   and  yards to Deon Butler Morellis 15yard dart to Derrick Williams in between two defenders at the 6yardline was arguably the best play hes made all year PERIOD

What would Morellis numbers look like right now if Penn States schedule was reversed if games at Ohio State and Notre Dame were played in the final four weeks of the season and not the first

Theres no way to tell just like theres no telling what Morellis numbers  as well as Penn States record  will look like at the end of the season after games against the porous defenses from Illinois Purdue Temple and Michigan State PERIOD Against any of those teams another 288yard passing performance is certainly not out of the question PERIOD

Well just have to wait several weeks to see that final answer PERIOD
