A former resident pediatrician at the University of Michigan Health Systems was found to possess child pornography PERIOD Reports revealed that UMHS waited nearly six months to report the incident to University Police PERIOD

In light of the recent scandals that shook other colleges including Penn State University and Syracuse University its imperative that the University report all incidents in a timely manner as long as it does not hinder ongoing investigations PERIOD University officials must be extra vigilant when dealing with reports of this nature PERIOD Though the Department of Public Safety doesnt have authority over UMHS security some groups like the Senate Advisory Committee for University Affairs have suggested changing oversight rules PERIOD Lapse in procedure not only affects the communitys safety of the community but also taints the overall goodwill that the University works to maintain PERIOD

Its some consolation that University President Mary Sue Coleman called for an internal investigation to determine the cause of the delay PERIOD Two outside groups  the U.S PERIOD Department of Education and the Joint Commission  are also reviewing the incident PERIOD Clearly the University is aware that such a delay in reporting exposes a faulty and outdated complaint system that warrants investigation PERIOD If the investigation reveals the complaint process was properly followed the University must change the process to ensure the efficient reporting of crimes PERIOD It would be unfair to attribute this singular case to an institutional failure of DPS or UHMS but the upmost care must be taken to ensure the wellbeing of the community PERIOD
