Jackie Brebeck  Friday March  

As Notre Dame enters the heart of its ACC schedule it will look to secure a pair of wins against Duke and Miami this weekend PERIOD

We are really excited about the opportunities this weekend Irish head coach Ryan Sachire said PERIOD Both Duke and Miami are great programs with really talented players and we are looking forward to the challenges that we will face. the Blue Devils   ACC had a rough start to their season winning only two out of their first eight matches PERIOD However they have been on an upswing winning five out of their last seven games PERIOD Duke is  in the alltime series against the Irish   ACC PERIOD Miami   ACC on the other hand is coming into its match against Notre Dame after a string of three losses PERIOD The Hurricanes will face Boston College before playing the Irish on Sunday PERIOD The Irish are  against the Hurricanes under Sachire PERIOD Against two conference opponents Sachire said the team will look to improve offensively after working on doubles play over the break PERIOD

We have been working hard on our offensive plays and our ability to attack our opponents Sachire said PERIOD In addition we have spent some time getting our doubles back up to the level we were playing at prior to spring break. notre Dames season has been inconsistent thus far containing a threegame winning streak and a fourgame losing streak PERIOD Accordingly another aspect of Notre Dames game Sachire said the team has been working to improve is its mental toughness PERIOD

One of the main goals that we have is to have our players be able to maintain focus on their tactics and game plan during the most pressurepacked situations in a match and ultimately not allow their focus to drift away from what it takes to be successful in the key moments of a match Sachire said PERIOD

Senior Alex Lawson looks to factor big in Notre Dames upcoming ACC matches PERIOD Lawson has been climbing up the alltime Irish doubles win list and is now tied at 3rdplace with  total wins PERIOD Ahead of Lawson on the alltime wins list are former players Jakub Pietrowski with  wins and Greg Andrews with  PERIOD

If the weather allows it Notre Dame will play in the Courtney Tennis Center against Duke at  p.m PERIOD on Fridayand against Miami at noonSunday PERIOD
