7382,2021-09-21,"sports editor Riley Millette compares  years of the rappers music

Riley Millette Sports EditorSeptember  

Now that Donda has had some time to sink in its time for the ageold discussion how do rapper and producer Kanye Wests albums stack up against each other

As with any artist theres a certain amount of consensus that exists with Wests discography PERIOD But theres still plenty to be discussed PERIOD Here are my personal top10 rankings of Wests solo albums PERIOD Sorry KIDS SEE GHOSTS and Watch the Throne which are collaborations with other artists are not included PERIOD



.My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy 

This masterpiece of an album features some of Wests hardesthitting and most emotional tracks PERIOD West is raw and unapologetic on this album as most have come to know him over the years PERIOD Hes brash uncensored and ready to let every ugly corner of his mind show itself PERIOD Even the features on this album from Nicki Minaj on Monster to Pusha T on Runaway are topnotch PERIOD Power is still in commercials today PERIOD Blame Game featuring John Legend is a highly underrated track that gets overshadowed by the other charttoppers on this album as it features some of Wests most sensitive lyrics that show his pain after his separation from Amber Rose PERIOD

Top three tracks Runaway Monster Hell of a Life



.The Life of Pablo 

West showed the most versatility and growth on The Life of Pablo for which the bar was already set substantially high following the release of his previous albums which were highly acclaimed PERIOD The sample selection on this album is immaculate from the Bam Bam sample on Famous to the Deep Inside snippet on Fade. there are very few skips on this album and it features Wests most playable party songs PERIOD No More Parties in LA and Waves are two earworm tracks that fit any occasion while Ultralight Beam and Wolves are stellar lowmood songs PERIOD

Top three tracks Famous Father Stretch my Hands Pt PERIOD  No More Parties in LA



.The College Dropout 

Wests debut album shows little age in its 17year history PERIOD The record features songs that are still played by a wide audience including Jesus Walks widely considered one of Wests alltime best tracks PERIOD This track sets the tone for what we expect from West today a devout Christian who will stop at nothing to spread his message about the power of God PERIOD Since the albums release West has grown unlike any other artist but the tracks on this album are still relevant to his character and brand today which is part of what makes it so timeless PERIOD

Top three tracks Jesus Walks All Falls Down Slow Jamz



.Ye 

Some would argue this is a high placement for Ye mostly due to the albums brevity and unfinished feeling PERIOD Ye came out during Wests historic G.O.O.D PERIOD Album Summer in which the record label G.O.O.D. released five albums that West executively produced all seven tracks long PERIOD This time period also coincided with Wests very public mental health crisis which is addressed in droves on the album PERIOD Violent Crimes and I Thought About Killing You are important tracks to Wests progression through his bipolar disorder while Wouldnt Leave gives insight to the marriage between West and Kim Kardashian from whom he is now separated PERIOD Ye is only  minutes long but gives irreplaceable insight into Wests mind PERIOD

Top three tracks Ghost Town I Thought About Killing You All Mine



.Graduation 

This is one of Wests most commercially successful albums PERIOD Songs like Stronger and Flashing Lights made West a household name when he released Graduation. this album was a more distinct deviation into pop and electronic music than West previously showed and it was met with great acclaim PERIOD Graduation isnt as emotional or poignant as the albums placed above it on this list but the star power that West exhibited on this project is toptier PERIOD This album is the beginning of the middle arc of Wests discography and it begins with a bang PERIOD

Top three tracks Stronger I Wonder Cant Tell Me Nothing



.Donda 

Yes Donda is very bloated PERIOD Waking up the morning it was released and seeing  tracks and  minutes wasnt what I wanted PERIOD But Wests willingness to branch out and collaborate with unexpected artists was a more pleasant surprise and makes up for the stretched runtime PERIOD As a Playboi Carti doubter he showed his ceiling on this project more than once with captivating and onbrand features PERIOD The Fivio Foreign verse on Off The Grid is still mindblowing PERIOD Don Tolivers hook on Moon is heavenly and enchanting PERIOD Donda has more than enough to offer lyrically and sonically PERIOD

Top three tracks Off The Grid Jail 

.808s and Heartbreak 

Its impossible to talk about 808s without acknowledging the influential power it had over the hiphop scene then and now PERIOD The combination of strings and bass on RoboCop is still a heavilyused duo today and the use of autotune on Heartless inspired countless artists PERIOD However this album lacks the versatility that others have PERIOD The human emotion on this album is evident but Wests commentary on relationships and emotion on 808s and Heartbreak pales in comparison to albums like Ye. top three tracks Heartless Paranoid Welcome to Heartbreak



.Late Registration 

This is probably the most unpopular placing of any album on this list PERIOD Wests sophomore effort features some of Wests most recognizable hits such as Gold Digger and Touch the Sky. it doesnt have the same magic that The College Dropout did PERIOD Highlights like Roses and We Major bring the firepower that otherwise lacks in the album but this is merely a good album that doesnt hold a candle to others that West has released PERIOD

Top three tracks Touch the Sky Roses We Major

.Yeezus 

Wests most outthere album Yeezus is an experiment that misses the mark overall PERIOD This albums release signaled a major change in Wests style PERIOD It was more abrasive and multilayered than anything else he had released to date PERIOD Black Skinhead is a spectacular track and Bound  features the precise production West is capable of but the lyrical content is a swing and a miss for me PERIOD Yes Im talking about the feature from God on the track I Am A God. its a bit too stratospheric PERIOD

Top three tracks Black Skinhead Bound  Blood on the Leaves



.Jesus is King 

No one was really sure what to expect from this album PERIOD It dropped without much warning and Wests fans were expecting Yandhi instead of this 27minute gospel album PERIOD Jesus is King is exactly what it sounds like a cry out to the powers that be PERIOD West focuses way too much attention on religious content on this album which is by no means a bad thing on its surface but as a nonreligious person only listening to gospel and little else for nearly a halfhour was a letdown PERIOD 

 Lover boy vs PERIOD Gods son A review of both Drakes Certified Lover Boy and Kanye Wests Donda

 MONTERO delivers the complete Lil Nas X experience

Top three tracks Selah Use This Gospel Follow God



The beauty of Wests collection is that theres something for everyone PERIOD It would make all the sense in the world to me if someone said Yeezus or 808s and Heartbreak were their favorite album PERIOD Both of those albums hold very high esteem in the hearts of diehard West fans PERIOD But if you see me walking around on the quad feel free to stop me and tell me how wrong I am about my rankings PERIOD
