In the wake of the Sept PERIOD  terrorist attack there have been  confirmed cases of hate crimes against Muslims and citizens of Middle Eastern descent across the nation PERIOD Neither Seattle nor the UW has escaped the trend  the virulence of the attacks matched only by their tendency to be carried out against those with no affiliation to the Muslim world PERIOD

Locally approximately eight highprofile cases have caught the medias attention PERIOD In response Mayor Paul Schell and Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske have met with members of local Arab and Muslim communities last month and offered police protection at neighborhood mosques PERIOD

At the Sheihk Idriss Mosque in Northgate members congregate in a bright room covered with a plush green carpet for daily prayers PERIOD Donning designer clothes like any other American they bow and press their foreheads to the floor as praises to Allah are sung PERIOD Spirits here remain high although the possibility of future hate crimes still concerns members of the Muslim community PERIOD

 said Ridani Taufik one of the members of the recently established  Taufik said women fear their veils or hijab makes them a target for harassment and some nonMuslim women have volunteered to run errands for them instead PERIOD Taufik who is of Morrocan descent claims he hears racial slurs directed toward him on a regular basis PERIOD

To deter possible acts of violence against the mosque people of Caucasian Hispanic and Asian backgrounds have come together to guard the mosques entrance PERIOD Everyone on  has given up their free time for Sheihk Idriss since a Kenmore WA man doused the perimeter of the building with gasoline and fired a handgun at two congregation members on Sept PERIOD  PERIOD Sympathetic citizens have flooded the mosque entrance with flowers and passersby in their vehicles honk to show their support PERIOD

At the UW only one case of possible harassment has been reported according to the UWPDs 60day incident log PERIOD According to the report while at the Health Sciences Center on Sept PERIOD  the victim was asked by another male if he was Arabic PERIOD The case is not currently under investigation and the UWPD was not able to comment PERIOD
