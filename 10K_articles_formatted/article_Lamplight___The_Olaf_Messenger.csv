assumed

I had turned the lamplight off PERIOD

However

upon awakening the bulb still glowed

burning PERIOD

How foolish

such a simple startling fact

The first item my tired eyes rest upon PERIOD

Why can I never

at least accurately remember

any final thoughts residing

restless whispers of worlds

full yet fleeting

with which I share my slumbering state

Lucidity

a cool drink of water PERIOD
