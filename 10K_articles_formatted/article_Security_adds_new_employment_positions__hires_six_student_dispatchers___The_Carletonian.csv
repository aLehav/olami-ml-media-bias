9040,2023-11-04,"this fall Security Services hired six student dispatchers PERIOD The student position is new to the office which had previously consisted exclusively of professional staff PERIOD

We are excited about this opportunity for students to work with security as dispatchers said John Bermel Director of Security and Emergency Management PERIOD This is important work and a solid opportunity for students to use their skills and interests to contribute to the Carleton community. blake Held Assistant Director of Security Services and Emergency Management supervises the student dispatcher program PERIOD Security Officer Lola Gavere manages the student dispatchers and is their primary point person for operational questions PERIOD

The student dispatchers work from an office at  Hoppin House which houses Security Services PERIOD The jobs primary responsibilities include answering incoming security calls relaying incident information to security officers and writing or supplementing incident reports said Bermel PERIOD

Dispatch is a critical link in the delivery of Security Services said Bermel PERIOD This position is responsible for receiving and prioritizing Carleton College Security Services requests for service in person and by phone and for notifying appropriate personnel in a manner consistent with the mission and goals of the College and Security Services. student dispatchers allow Security to maintain more contact with callers while at the same time freeing up officers to move quickly and respond to events without also having to answer calls explained Student Dispatcher James Craig  PERIOD When no students are working in the dispatch office security officers take incoming calls PERIOD

Student dispatchers work during a period that commonly has high call volume said Bermel PERIOD Having the student dispatchers answering calls allows security officers to handle duties without interruption PERIOD The dispatchers are a security team multiplier. student dispatchers do not enforce policy nor resolve issues PERIOD In some ways we act like a filter for the Security Services staff by summarizing information they need on one hand while keeping callers informed and uptodate on the other said Craig PERIOD

Student dispatchers are not responsible for enforcement or conflict resolution among peers noted Craig PERIOD I can reference rules and regulations for students if needed but this role doesnt involve that kind of responsibility PERIOD We might be able to provide some answers to rulerelated questions but anything serious is passed on to security staff said Craig PERIOD

Craig learned about the open position via a flyer he saw on campus during New Student Week PERIOD I have a background in radio operations and emergency services so I felt that I would be useful in this role said Craig PERIOD Its a unique way to help out around campus as well as an insight into a side of Carleton most students dont interact with often. i was interested in working in this role because I have always had some amount of curiosity regarding what it was like to work in a security department said student dispatcher Jordan Navarro  PERIOD I have never been in a role like this before. each student dispatcher underwent training with Gavere before starting in the role said Bermel PERIOD Gavere continues to meet with students for ongoing training PERIOD

The training included learning how to pick up calls how to use the radio to communicate with officers the calllogging and incidentreporting processes and various Security codes used to keep communication concise explained student dispatcher Yucheng Yang  PERIOD

We want the student dispatchers to be comfortable and capable in their position and we train for that standard said Bermel PERIOD Additionally Security Officers are available as a resource for student dispatchers at all times PERIOD

The job requires proficiency at phone and radio communication which in my opinion requires realworld practice to really master said Craig PERIOD The Security staff are very good at providing pointers resources and an initial orientation and after that its time to start taking calls. for Craig the hardest part of the dispatcher job is handling numerous situations at once PERIOD There have been a few instances where multiple incidents occur in a short period of time he said PERIOD Ive had to juggle conversations with officers and the individuals involved in addition to the police while trying to determine what priority these issues should have over each other PERIOD Its a lot of fun but when medical or safety issues get mixed in the stakes go up and its important to keep a clear head. knowing that I can improve multipleincident situations is very rewarding said Craig PERIOD Its always good to know you personally helped out with anything from a parking ticket or a locked building to an urgent medical incident. being able to help those in need on time is the most satisfactory part of this job said Yang PERIOD Knowing that people are relying on your means you have to take on responsibility and be there for them which sometimes is stressful but rewarding. the Security office hopes to expand the program to cover breaks in the academic year said Bermel PERIOD For now student dispatchers are slated to work only during the academic terms PERIOD

Bermel also hopes to see the hours per day of student dispatcher coverage expand in the future PERIOD We would like to see the student dispatcher role continue and evolve to best meet the needs of the Carleton community said Bermel PERIOD The student dispatchers will be a key source of input for how that will look.The office is currently looking to hire a seventh student dispatcher said Bermel PERIOD

Criteria for student dispatcher employment includes a demonstrated interest in campus security and contributing to the welfare of the community along with basic communication skills said Bermel PERIOD The office is looking for Sophomores Juniors and Seniors to fill the role because they have the strongest working knowledge of the campus he said PERIOD
