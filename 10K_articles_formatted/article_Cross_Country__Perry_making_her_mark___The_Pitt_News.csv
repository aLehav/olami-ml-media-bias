The first several months of college are usually spent adjusting to the new environment PERIOD For The first several months of college are usually spent adjusting to the new environment PERIOD For Morgan Perry it took no time to feel at home and establish herself as one of Pitts top runners PERIOD

Even before coming to campus Perry had started to find a home on the crosscountry team with her newly minted mentor senior Miya Johnson PERIOD

Since Perrys first visit to Pitt Johnson has been a big sister role model and mentor to Perry PERIOD They stayed in contact after the visit by talking to one another on the phone PERIOD During her official visit Perry said she felt an immediate connection to Johnson PERIOD

She could trust me and I could trust her Perry said PERIOD

Their relationship has continued to develop since Perry arrived on campus PERIOD The fact that no one served as a mentor to Johnson when she entered the program helped motivate her to be a better mentor to Perry PERIOD

There werent many distance girls when I came into the program Johnson said PERIOD I didnt have a mentor so I feel its kind of my job to mentor Morgan. perry has found success early and often this year PERIOD Coming from a state championship team at Pennsbury High School she has consistently finished among the top runners from the Pitt team and was first among Pitt runners at the Big East Championships two weeks ago PERIOD This weekend the freshman will run with seven other Panthers at the NCAA Division I MidAtlantic Regional meet PERIOD This tournament depending on her finish in comparison to others across the country could lead her to the NCAA National Championships held November nineteenth in Louisville Ky PERIOD

Alonzo Webb Pitts crosscountry and track and field head coach said Perry has been the teams top runner at meets because of her ability PERIOD

Its unusual for a freshman to come into a Division I program be a leader and compete Webb said PERIOD She wants people to be able to count on her PERIOD She doesnt want to let anyone down. in her first meet of the year she led the Panthers with a fourteenth overall finish and a time of  PERIOD She followed that performance by pacing the team again with a personal record of . good for a fifthplace finish overall PERIOD

Perry finished seventeenth overall and second among her teammates at the third meet of the year with a time of . an improvement from her first meet which was at Schenley Park PERIOD In the following race she ran a team best . finishing eighteenth PERIOD

Perry attributed her success to the pressure to succeed that she faced in high school where her team was a crosscountry powerhouse PERIOD She has gained highlevel experience from being a member of a state championship team that went undefeated last year PERIOD

In high school we always had the pressure to win Perry said PERIOD We literally had to win every single meet to qualify for states and we did PERIOD Its a normal thing for me to want to do well PERIOD Its kind of builtin now because I dealt with it all throughout my high school career. two weekends ago at the Big East Championships Perry placed first among Pitt runners with a 6K time of . pERIOD

Im never satisfied to be honest Perry said PERIOD

Perry has displayed this attribute in training as well as in races PERIOD When the team splits into groups Perry is the only freshman in the fastest group PERIOD Despite her success in high school Perry doesnt have a background in longdistance running PERIOD When she started running track in seventh grade she thought she was going to be a  or 400meter sprinter PERIOD She only started crosscountry in her sophomore year of high school and even then she was hesitant PERIOD

Oh no thats too much running Perry said in retrospect PERIOD

But she succeeded almost right away placing in the top three on her team for her whole high school career PERIOD Simultaneously she made the shift to longer distances in track first to the 800meter and then the mile PERIOD

Perrys siblings did not run much growing up PERIOD Her 23yearold brother Robert ran track in middle school before moving onto lacrosse and wrestling in high school while her twin sister Lindsay is a cheerleader PERIOD

Perrys father Robert was a sprinter and her uncle and cousin were hurdlers PERIOD While the family has a history of competitive running Morgan is the only one who does long distance PERIOD

Well joke about it PERIOD Race me in the sprint Ill race you in long distance Perry said PERIOD

But more than anything the runners in her family are proud and excited for her PERIOD They went to all of her high school meets and have tried to guide her career PERIOD

Her father especially has aided Perry with her running PERIOD

When it comes to running hes like my other coach Perry said PERIOD We always talk strategy the night before a race PERIOD He gives me pep talks. while Perry doesnt have a preference between crosscountry and track she noted the significant differences between the two and specifically how they affect her mindset during the race PERIOD

With crosscountry for example Perry explained how strategically she has to factor in the layout of a course  something that doesnt necessarily come into play on a track PERIOD

On hills I tend to be a little more passive because theyre my weak point Perry said PERIOD Off of the hill is where Ill be aggressive PERIOD Ill take the hill a bit lighter and then off the top is when Ill be more aggressive. track involves strategy but there isnt as much time to think about it because the race is so much shorter PERIOD Perry described crosscountry as laid back and track as more intense and uptight. you can get boxed in Perry said PERIOD Theres a pack that you generally want to stay with the whole time PERIOD You dont want to run in lane four when you can run in lane one simply because youll be running a longer distance. perry who is undecided as a major is enrolled in the school of Arts and Sciences PERIOD

If there is one thing that Perry has had a hard time adjusting to it is life without her two cats Drew a Halloween cat as Perry described him and Britney a tortoiseshell cat PERIOD

Miss is an understatement Perry said I go on Photobucket and look at their pictures PERIOD Its a mess. join our newsletter
