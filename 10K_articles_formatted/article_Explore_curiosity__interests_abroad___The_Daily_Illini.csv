2317,2023-10-26,"the Universitys Study Abroad Office has more options than any globetrotting adventurer could ever possibly need PERIOD From Kenya to the United Kingdom to India to Brazil students at the University have enough options to get their heads spinning and their excitement travelling  quite literally  in every direction around the globe PERIOD

And I dont think students should leave this opportunistic University  or time in their lives  without catapulting themselves in at least one of those directions PERIOD

For many study abroad will be the pinnacle of an undergraduate career as it offers an opportunity to experience and learn from another culture to become immersed in a language to push ones self beyond the limits of a comfort zone and to act as a true test of adventurousness and independence hang out on the brim of the unknown and the uncertain and to learn from it PERIOD

However like most things in life college will too come to an end and your study abroad experience will seem an ephemeral moment that slipped through your fingertips PERIOD

I havent left for my study abroad program yet and I can already feel myself relishing in the hadbeen moments of life across the pond PERIOD



I would encourage students to plan for their abroad experience but to also remember that you dont have to have it all figured out freshman year PERIOD Study abroad was on my mind before I even arrived at college PERIOD I mean anything with the word abroad has always kind of perked me up ever since my first trip outside of the U.S PERIOD I love learning languages and about other cultures and foods and anything and everything that comes along with seeing the world PERIOD So pardon me while I take that travelobsessed opinion and continue on my soapbox PERIOD

I suggest adapting to your new environment on campus prior to taking steps toward studying abroad PERIOD Take your first year here to get acclimated at college to learn about yourself and to find your place in a new community PERIOD This takes time PERIOD If youre like me the study abroad fantasies will be popping up from the back of your mind PERIOD Part of having wanderlust is being aware of your attachment to a place and having the ability to let it go so that you can both let yourself go a little bit more and continue into the unknown PERIOD

College is short PERIOD Spending a year or two here and then a year abroad can seem disruptive PERIOD But I think its worth it even if you are a transfer student PERIOD Theres a way to make it work PERIOD

I almost didnt make my plans to study abroad even though it was always on my mind PERIOD Graduation was nearing and I looked at myself crossing over the bridge to the life of a college graduate PERIOD I knew something wasnt happening as I had wanted PERIOD

We wont get this time back PERIOD

Regardless of how many times you change your major question your major think about transferring think about taking a semester off or think about how study abroad might not be worth the money or the extra semester or even the year that you might have to take to work this into your plans or how you dont totally understand life yet or what youre even doing with yours half of of the time do it PERIOD

Take a risk PERIOD

I do not expect my study abroad experience to be some series of moments featuring me on a romantic mountaintop collecting the blissful unclouded rays of sunlight and just dreaming worriless thoughts about the gelato I will eat later whilst my homework completes itself or the cool onceinalifetime volunteer opportunity that I will somehow find after my lifechanging voyage through the rainforest PERIOD No PERIOD

I expect it to be hard PERIOD I expect it to be a wonderful challenge I foresee a trip across the globe marked by struggle and confusion and misspoken French sentences PERIOD I foresee myself tripping over ancient streets because Im too accustomed to the pavement of Champaign but I also foresee myself tripping over what I think I already know only to learn how much I dont PERIOD

These expectations however full of lofty desires are why I think everyone should study abroad if they can PERIOD

You dont know whats going to happen PERIOD Thats the beauty of it PERIOD

Pump the breaks PERIOD Take the time to build your life and grow beyond what you already know PERIOD In my experience theres no greater learning that can take place in life than being tossed about by your own curiosity questions confusions and all the mistakes they may bring PERIOD

Whatever it is that you are searching for the Study Abroad Office has a convenient advanced search engine on its website to help you find your way PERIOD
