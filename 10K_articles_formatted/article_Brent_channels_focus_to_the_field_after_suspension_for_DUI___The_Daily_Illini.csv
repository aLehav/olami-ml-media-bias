2293,2023-11-04,"josh Brents future was up in the air for some time PERIOD

After receiving a DUI in February the junior defensive tackle was suspended indefinitely from the team for spring practice then served jail time during the summer PERIOD He was reinstated for training camp but still wasnt sure if he would be suspended for any games PERIOD

But at Tuesdays press conference Illini head football coach Ron Zook ended all doubt saying Brent is scheduled to play on Saturday in the teams opener against Missouri PERIOD

Although the decision may be controversial in the public eye Zook stands by his decision PERIOD

I have a conversation with Josh daily  I know him as a person Zook said PERIOD I think that was important to me and thats why we waited this long PERIOD Athletic director Ron Guenther and I had a lot of conversations PERIOD This is our program and obviously its important and we wanted to make sure we were doing the right thing. from the football field to the tennis court stay up to date on all things Illini sports from the the best student sports journalists in the Midwest PERIOD

Brent said he wasnt notified until it was announced to the media that he would be playing but hes just happy hell be on the field Saturday PERIOD

Im just grateful coach Ron Guenther our athletic director and Coach Zook decided to make the choice that they did and Im glad my teammates supported them in the decisions that they made he said PERIOD Im just grateful for the opportunity. zook cited Brents ability to come out of the ordeal as a better person as one reason for his decision PERIOD

Still Brent doesnt quite understand the reason his coach decided to let him play PERIOD

Truthfully Im not really sure he said PERIOD I just tried to be on my best behavior do all the right things PERIOD Not necessarily just to get this opportunity but to straighten out my life and sort of get some things in order. i know it was a tough decision for coach and the University administrative staff so I was patient as can be willing to accept any decision they were willing to make. brents play is crucial to a defensive line that is shaping up to be one of the teams strengths PERIOD Fellow defensive tackle Corey Liuget said having Brent back in the lineup helps him improve every day PERIOD

He feeds off me and I feed off him during practice said the sophomore who will line up next to Brent on Saturday PERIOD Last week during practice he got mad so I said Forget it Ive got to get mad. so we both just got mad and tore the offensive line up. brent knows his focus is crucial to the defensive lines success as he realizes hell have to deal with unruly fans PERIOD

Any stadium you go to theres going to be some bad fans that have some nasty things to say about you no matter how good of a person you are Brent said PERIOD You expect it because it comes along with the game. i really dont pay too much attention to it I just pay attention to the game.",Brent channels focus to the field after suspension for DUI - The Daily Illini,University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
