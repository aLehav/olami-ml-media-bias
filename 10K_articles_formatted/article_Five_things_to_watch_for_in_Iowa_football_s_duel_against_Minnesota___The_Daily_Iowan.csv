7061,2021-03-13,"now with Erick All out for the season Iowa is left with a tight end room who has caught a grand total of eight passes in the Black and Gold over the past two seasons PERIOD Five of these receptions have come from senior Steven Stillianos who is now listed as the starter on the depth chart PERIOD A transfer from Lafayette Stillianos earned allPatriot League firstteam honors in the spring and fall of  PERIOD Stillianos said hes valued his time in Iowa City especially learning from Hawkeye TE coach Abdul Hodge who has taught him to be an allaround tight end one who is both confident to run routes and unafraid to block in the run game PERIOD As for Pascuzzi starting quarterback Deacon Hill called the secondyear dependable and a very smart guy after getting reps with the tight end in the second unit last spring PERIOD Also Hawkeye head coach Kirk Ferentz mentioned fullback Hayden Large as another possible option at tight end as Large played the position for three years while at Dordt University in Sioux Center Iowa recording  catches for  yards and  touchdowns PERIOD Dont be surprised to see a mixed bag of tight ends out there as probably three to four will see action as the Hawkeyes run multiTE sets a lot PERIOD Im not saying these replacements have to put up Luke Lachey and Alllike numbers but they need to at least catch passes when needed especially on third down PERIOD

Time and time again the Iowa ground game has proven it is capable of carrying the offense but oftentimes this production comes through one big play such as Kaleb Johnsons 67yard score against Purdue and Leshon Williams 82yard TD run last week against Wisconsin PERIOD Eliminating Williams highlight the Hawkeyes ran for just . yards per carry PERIOD Nevertheless Minnesota is rather average against the run ranking sixty-fifth in the FBS in terms of rushing defense allowing  rushing yards per game to its opponents PERIOD Hills accuracy at QB is still a question mark in my opinion so Iowas offense on Saturday will feature plenty of handoffs PERIOD How consistent the run game can be will be answered on Saturday and the Hawkeyes will receive a muchneeded boost with the likely return of running back Jaziun Patterson whom Ferentz hinted could be back on the field this weekend PERIOD

I know Ive been saying this for the last couple of weeks now but Hill can throw for as few yards as he wants as long as doesnt turn the ball over PERIOD The Wisconsin transfer almost threw two picks against his former team last week the second one of which wouldve put the Badgers within field goal range PERIOD The last thing the Hawkeyes need to do is to keep their defense on the field longer than it has to be as the unit will be taking a physical beating as a result of Minnesotas tendency to keep the ball on the ground PERIOD Hill will throw the ball when he needs to but has to keep possession or else Iowa will be in trouble and the idea of backup Joe Labas under center will be a stronger possibility PERIOD

Minnesota has been known for having size up front on its offensive line and its  squad is no different PERIOD The smallest person on the Gophers front five is center Nathan Boe who stands at sixfootfive and  pounds PERIOD Stationed around Boe are sixfootfive and sixfootseven guards Tyler Cooper and Martes Lewis while on the edges at the tackle spots are  AllBig Ten honorable mentions Quinn Carroll and Aireontae Esery PERIOD Breaking through such a wall of an offensive line will be tough on Iowas rather undersized defensive lineman such as Joe Evans who is listed at sixfoottwo and  pounds PERIOD While Evans said Tuesday that proper fundamentals and staying low in his pass rush will prevent him from being thrown out the club by his opponents the Hawkeyes QB pressure needs to be consistent if they want to be as disruptive as they were the past two contests PERIOD Yet with the healthy Iowa defensive tackle Yayha Black in question doing so will be a tall order PERIOD

Heres a fun fact Minnesota and Iowa rank fourth and sixth in the nation respectively in terms of fewest penalties PERIOD Why that could have to do with a lack of pass attempts as pass blocking often results in more holding calls but Im not certain PERIOD What the stat does tell me is both squads are disciplined and will have to continue to be so on Saturday PERIOD Against Wisconsin Iowa had an unusual amount of penalties registering five flags resulting in a total of  yards lost PERIOD Those five nearly make up a quarter of the Hawkeyes total of  for the season PERIOD While it may sound obvious penalty yards will be a huge difference maker in this game as both squads will be looking to squeeze out as many yards as they can with slow and methodical run schemes PERIOD",Five things to watch for in Iowa football's duel against Minnesota - The Daily Iowan,University of Iowa
