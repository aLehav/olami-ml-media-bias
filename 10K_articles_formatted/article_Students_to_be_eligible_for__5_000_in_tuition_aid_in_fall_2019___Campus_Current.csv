Community college students in Maryland can receive up to  in tuition assistance from the state through a new scholarship program starting next fall PERIOD

Fulltime students who have graduated from high school or earned a GED within the last two years may qualify for the Maryland Community College Promise Scholarship as long as their family income is less than  PERIOD

SGA President Jacob Smith the law shows Marylands commitment to having students have access to higher education PERIOD  I think the law is really great just as long as people dont mistake for being free tuition for everybody. dr PERIOD Mike Gavin AACCs vice president for learning agreed PERIOD The general public does not understand the limited number of students that this will be applicable to he said PERIOD

Former SGA president Jonathan ODea testified in support of the law in the spring saying the program could reduce debt from student loans PERIOD

I think this law will help because it will make students realize that they have more financial help then they did in the past ODea said PERIOD So the debt problems  its not as daunting. two Maryland community colleges Community College of Baltimore County and Carroll Community College will start similar scholarship programs this semester PERIOD

Dr PERIOD John Grabowski dean of Enrollment Services said he cannot pin down the exact number of students who will qualify for the state program PERIOD

He noted that the states  community colleges will share  million worth of awards so colleges will have to decide which students will get the money PERIOD

One of the factors that could be first come first serve Grabowski said PERIOD So it is really really important that a student who applies for the college  also complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid at this very same time. because the award is part of a socalled lastdollar program students must exhaust financial aid and other scholarships before receiving the Promise money PERIOD

The new tuition law makes it a lot more open for single students and students who come from lowincome families Nikko Maresca a firstyear computer science student said PERIOD It gives them more of an opportunity to actually go to college and not worry about having to pay such exorbitant fees to go to school and worry about such a large tuition over the two years they are going to AACC. aACC President Dawn Lindsay said she is very pleased that the legislature passed the bill establishing this program and that the governor signed the bill into law. however she added We also know that these new programs will not solve the financial challenges that many of our students face. gov PERIOD Larry Hogan in announcing the scholarship pointed to the nearly  percent of Maryland college students who graduate with thousands of dollars in student debt PERIOD This financial burden is preventing young Marylanders from achieving financial security and has become a roadblock to homeownership and saving for retirement PERIOD That changes today. campus Current
