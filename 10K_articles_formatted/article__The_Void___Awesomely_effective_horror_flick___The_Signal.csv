Verdict The Void doesnt need to make sense to be crazy stupid good PERIOD Its fun and scary and great PERIOD See it PERIOD

The Void is crazy beautiful nailbitingly effective nonsense PERIOD As such I love it and you should love it too PERIOD Orwell if you love the idea of a bajillion B horror tropes smashed together into one movie and dont mind not exactly following along with everything happening after thirty minutesthen you will love this movie PERIOD

Local cop Daniel finds James injured on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere PERIOD Daniel takes him to the closest hospital which is operating on next to nothing because of a recent fire spooky burned down hospital  stupidly awesome horror setting PERIOD

Then a lot of stuff starts happening which I will quickly summarize a nurse stabs a patient and then turns into a Cronenbergian tentacle monster two guys show up trying to shoot James and people get stabbed pregnant teen Maggie starts having contractions and a bunch of mystical cult members wearing white robes and carrying big knives surround the place so nobody can leave PERIOD And thats the set up PERIOD

I have to say The Void was one of the best theater experiences this year PERIOD I was giddy the whole time and its probably mostly because this movie is so whacked out that I was shocked and delighted by every choice it made PERIOD Going in I couldnt decide if the trailer was suggesting a movie about a cult about demons or a cult made up of demons PERIOD Neither of those actually sum up all the weirdness in this movie PERIOD So every single crazy monstrous turn of events blew my mind PERIOD It seems directors Steven Kostanski and Jeremy Gillespie couldnt decide which of their favorite 80s horror movies to riff on so they picked out tropes at random and created a mashup that works incredibly well and defies prediction PERIOD

It also helps that the film totally understands its stakes and creates mad peopleoriented tension in its first act PERIOD It sets up these wonderful tense power struggles in the beginning that make the film move gloriously and importantly give you a reason to stay invested during the insane latter half PERIOD After the first tentacle monster we get slapped with a James vs PERIOD the two mystery guys with shotguns vs PERIOD James with a scalpel pointed at pregnant Maggies neck and the film isnt afraid to blow this up to epic proportions PERIOD Its super great and uber effective PERIOD

None of this is meant to imply that the last half is nonfunctioning PERIOD Its focused on the people vs PERIOD the monsters and the sheer number of types of monsters gets sticky if you think about it too hard PERIOD I wasted away my finals week trying to come up with a theory about how all these monster bodies work together in tandem to create like a point so I can tell you for sure The Void simply likes monsters and it has a lot of them PERIOD

For all you good folk who are nonetheless picky about spoilers Ill just say theres a weird mix of body horror and cosmic horror horror of the unknowable afterlife coming into play that dont necessarily fit together despite the films generous desire to take us to the brink of its titular void PERIOD 
But that sure as heck doesnt make it any less fun and scary which is really all that matters PERIOD So to The Void I say great job great flick What a blast PERIOD
