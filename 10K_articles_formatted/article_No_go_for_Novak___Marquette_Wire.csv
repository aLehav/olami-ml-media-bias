3167,2023-11-04,"last July while his teammates were in Milwaukee readying themselves for the next semester or even the NBA draft sophomore forward Steve Novak was competing with the nations best college basketball players in the hopes of making the USA PanAmerican basketball team PERIOD

Novak and  other hopefuls  including Connecticuts Emeka Okafor and Ben Johnson Missouris Ricky Paulding and Arthur Johnson and Syracuses Hakim Warrick  first traveled to Colorado Springs Colo. where they hoped to make the cut to  PERIOD

They practiced alongside Olympians at the Olympic Villages gymnasium PERIOD

Coaching the variety of standouts were Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo Missouris Quin Snyder and Washingtons Lorenzo Romar PERIOD

Novak made the Colorado cut and moved on to the next round of tryouts in Orlando Fla. at the Orlando Magics training facility PERIOD From there the field would shrink from  to the final  PERIOD

Novak hit a bit of a cold shooting streak and was unable to show the coaches that his inside game had progressed enough to warrant a spot on the squad PERIOD

Im not sure anything really went wrong for me Novak said PERIOD It was more of a thing where I went in with a mindset of things I wanted to work on PERIOD I wanted to work on banging down low with the big guys rather than just being a wing player PERIOD Ive been getting stronger so I can play an insideoutside game PERIOD

I was competing with older guys and when I was cut they told me that some of the guys were just older with more experience PERIOD They would have needed me in the post and other guys were stronger in that area than I was. one of those bigger more experienced players was his roommate at the tryouts UConns Okafor PERIOD

The 6foot9 240pound standout is widely regarded as one of the best  if not the best  players in next years NBA draft. okafor is a heck of a player Novak said PERIOD Hes got a heck of a body with long arms and when he develops his offensive game hell be a top pick in the draft next year PERIOD

Its great any time you can play with guys like this PERIOD Being able to play with your countrys top guys it shows you how you compare and what they have and what you need to improve on. in the PanAm games the Americans fell to Brazil in the semifinals  PERIOD The collegians eventually lost to Puerto Rico  in the bronze medal game.Steven Pich
