No this isnt a list of possible spring break destinations  its a list of the places the Emerson mens volleyball team has recently competed PERIOD



The Lions played Lasell College in Newton on Feb PERIOD  kicking off a 19game stretch through which Emerson has and will continue to play  of its  games on the road PERIOD



Traveling to away games is tough enough on a professional athlete but the players said it can be even more of a strain on studentathletes PERIOD



Jeff Ackerstein a junior outside hitter said he has to juggle sports on the road with his studies PERIOD



Its a journey before every game starts PERIOD We have an hour warmup before each game and sometimes we have to leave twoandahalf hours before the game PERIOD It takes its toll said Ackerstein a postproduction major PERIOD



Ackerstein said the team practices for two hours almost every day in addition to the games which sometimes clash with his academic schedule PERIOD



Unfortunately I had to miss a game because I had class and it was a class I couldnt miss he said PERIOD



And of course the players are often also involved in other extracurricular activities PERIOD For Eric Doherty a sophomore digital postproduction major having a wellplanned schedule is essential PERIOD



Im involved in volleyball but Im also involved in a ton of other things Doherty said PERIOD You have to be good at planning ahead PERIOD I live by my iPhone calendar. the extensive schedule seems to have taken a toll on the Lions evidenced by the scoreboard PERIOD



Emerson is  in away games and  in games played at neutral sites PERIOD After notching four wins in their first six games the Lions went on their extended road trip and promptly dropped ten straight contests PERIOD Over this period they managed to win only two sets PERIOD



We feel more comfortable at home Ackerstein said PERIOD We get down there and warm up right away and our fans are there PERIOD Were all a little looser when we play at home. playing so many games away may seem like a disadvantage but head coach Craig Letourneau explained that playing such a large percentage of games on the road is not unusual in the GNAC PERIOD



Last year we had a ton of matches at home PERIOD It rotates every year said Letourneau PERIOD Also we play a lot of tournaments and trimatches PERIOD We do the best we can with our schedule. emerson competed in the Endicott College Tournament in Beverly Mass PERIOD earlier this season and lost all four games PERIOD They will play in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Tournament in Cambridge this weekend PERIOD



While playing four games in two days on a weekend may be arduous Coach Letourneau stressed the importance of accepting challenges PERIOD



He pointed to some of the competitors Emerson will face in the upcoming tournament PERIOD MIT has made the postseason in its conference for six straight seasons PERIOD Endicott has a modest record of  but last year made the North East Collegiate Volleyball Association quarterfinals PERIOD



Its very helpful to play in tournaments against teams that on paper we know are going to be better than us Letourneau said PERIOD You want to play better competition so you get better PERIOD You dont get better by having an undefeated record and only playing teams you know youre going to beat. emerson managed to come up with wins against Regis College and Elms College in the final week of February PERIOD

Having a lot of road games can be frustrating but we all knew the deal going into the season Doherty said PERIOD He cited the  win over Elms as the start of a possible lateseason run PERIOD I hope we can look back on the season and say Thats the point when we turned it around. the streak of away games will end with a double header against Albertus Magnus and Johnson  Wales in Providence R.I PERIOD on March  PERIOD The Lions will then end their regular season with a fourgame homestand PERIOD The final two games will be GNAC matchups against Mount Ida and Lasell PERIOD
