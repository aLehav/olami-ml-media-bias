Before Sept PERIOD  students could arrive at the Sacramento International Airport  minutes before takeoff check their bags at the curb and run to their terminal to fly home for the holidays PERIOD

Now they need to arrive up to two hours prior to takeoff to allow time for the security procedures in place since the terrorist attacks PERIOD

Cheryl Demetriff director of marketing and public relations for the Sacramento International Airport said as of last week  percent of normal scheduled flights were taking off and she did not know when they would reach  percent PERIOD

Were ready and functioning she said PERIOD Were just waiting for our airline partners to tell us when theyre going to increase flights. new procedures eliminated curbside baggage checkin and curbside parking PERIOD Now all vehicles must park at least  feet from the airport and only passengers are allowed past security check points to the boarding terminals Demetriff said PERIOD

The airlines are recommending arriving an hour and a half to two hours early because of the new security process PERIOD

From my perspective everybody has been calm and understanding about the new security measures Demetriff said PERIOD They understand they may have to wait a little longer for their own safety. there havent been any scares evacuations or threats at Sacramento International Airport since the attacks she said PERIOD

Demetriff said the airport has increased seating downstairs to accommodate people waiting for travelers and is also planning to increase food services downstairs since only passengers are allowed past security check points PERIOD

Patty Gillett owner of Chico Travel Service said she has spent  percent of her day refunding tickets and answering questions since the attacks PERIOD

She said a lot of people traveling for leisure canceled or postponed their trips but business travelers are still buying tickets PERIOD

Most people are concerned and are content to stay home right now Gillett said PERIOD Just the traveling within the next  days are being canceled but longterm travel has not been affected yet. she said  percent of the people calling to ask her questions did not book tickets through her PERIOD

People are calling travel agents to find out what to do because they cant get a hold of the airlines or Web sites where they got their ticket to find out whats going on she said PERIOD

Most people are calling about ticket refunds new security procedures or to postpone travel plans she said PERIOD

Robert Grierson manager of Chico Municipal Airport said even small airports are being affected by the changes PERIOD

All commercial planes are back on schedule at the Chico airport with five United Express flight arrivals and five departures PERIOD

Although personal corporate personal and corporate planes resumed flying Thursday they are still not full to capacity which accounts for the majority of the airports revenues Grierson said PERIOD

Revenues are going down but costs are going up because of all the new security procedures he said PERIOD

In accordance with new Federal Aviation Administration rules the parking lots in front of the Chico Municipal Airport have been closed forcing people to park at least  feet from the building Grierson said PERIOD There are also no sharp objects allowed in the airport including small pocketknives and metal nail files PERIOD

Grierson said he has already heard horror stories about people arriving at big airports such as the San Francisco International Airport two hours early and still not making their flights because of the security procedures PERIOD

Students should seriously consider flying out of Chico because with two people checking  people they can easily get to their flight on time he said PERIOD As opposed to driving an hour and a half to Sacramento and still having to wait in lines for two hours. the airline is recommending that passengers arrive an hour and a half prior to takeoff at Chico Municipal Airport he said PERIOD

But for some students the terrorist attacks escalated their fear of flying so much that they wont step foot on a plane PERIOD

Wendy Martin a 22yearold Chico State University music major said she is too afraid to fly PERIOD

I dont want to travel by plane anymore Martin said PERIOD I had major anxiety before over flying and after this I really dont want to fly. she said she is also concerned for her friend who is a United Airlines flight attendant PERIOD Martin said her friend is taking time off work by choice but will go back to work in a few weeks PERIOD

I was worried about her on Sept PERIOD  when I woke up Martin said PERIOD Im happy shes being smart about it and not just jumping back into work right away. but not all students are letting fear get the best of them PERIOD

Arielle Ray a 21yearold senior said she usually drives home for the holidays but if she needed to fly she wouldnt let fear stop her PERIOD

There was just as much of a chance for a plane crash to happen before or after Tuesday she said PERIOD Theres no way to know and you cant live your life in fear. chico States independent student newspaper
