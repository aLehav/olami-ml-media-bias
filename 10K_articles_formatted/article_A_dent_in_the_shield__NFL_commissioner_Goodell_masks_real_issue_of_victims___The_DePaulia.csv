Amidst the controversy surrounding domestic violence issues involving the NFL its not hard to come to think that through the various press conferences and interviews that have been conducted that the league and their players along with their sponsors are the sole parties being affected PERIOD However the culture that currently surrounds our societys views on domestic violence has exposed the leagues lack of responsibility and demanded that the victims be put into consideration PERIOD

I disappointed our fans our partners and we need to do better PERIOD I made it clear to sponsors directly that we are going to do better in this area Goodell said in his press conference when asked about certain sponsors putting out disapproving statements PERIOD There are things that we need to clean up in our house and make sure that we get right and we will. in response NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell implemented a new advisory group composed of all women that is designed to organize and enforce policies and programs relating to domestic violence and sexual assault PERIOD On the surface the move seemed like a step in the right direction however the newly introduced panel failed again to represent the victims of these problems PERIOD

According to the Unofficial  NFL Player Census over twothirds of the league is composed of AfricanAmerican players and with AfricanAmerican women being the ones who are disproportionately affected by domestic abuse their inputs would prove to be the most valuable yet not one AfricanAmerican female was featured on the panel PERIOD

The relationship between sponsors of the NFL and the league itself go both ways PERIOD On one hand the sponsors utilize the generally positive aura of the league to represent their brands with a likeable image PERIOD In addition the league also relies heavily on these sponsorships and the advertisements and money that come with them PERIOD Consequently this fact has caused NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to lose sight of the real issue at hand the victims of domestic abuse PERIOD

Ryan Gillespie a senior organizational communications and Spanish major at DePaul University saw through Goodells words PERIOD

I think its typical of the NFL theyve maintained a pattern of behavior with an unwillingness to stay consistent and develop a stance on domestic violence Gillespie said PERIOD Ray Rices punishment was overturned strictly as a result of public opinion. public relations have and will continue to be important in the NFLs attempt to fashion their message of being positive contributors to society and making that message heard with as much clarity as possible PERIOD Unfortunately distractions that hinder the transmission of that message are addressed and dealt with in a manner that attempts to disguise the severity of the situation with newly implemented policies aimed at the players rather than the individuals personally affected PERIOD

Its really a bait and switch tactic a complete lack of accountability on the part of the league Gillespie said PERIOD Theyve tried to trick the general public into thinking that the problem has been acknowledged acted upon and resolved. whether the NFL failed to properly investigate and obtain the correct information necessary to come to an appropriate punishment or not is irrelevant whats at stake and what is much more concerning are the priorities of the league being centered around their sponsors and portraying an image that doesnt necessarily produce an accurate reflection of the league PERIOD Sponsors arent at fault for not wanting to be publicly associated with an organization that beats women abuses children and who continues to waver on whether or not those actions warrant any sort of punishment PERIOD

Jake Puleo a transfer student studying communications and media studies at DePaul University wasnt fooled by the policies and actions of the league PERIOD

Its never been okay to hit a woman or a child in any context and I cant understand why the NFL has had such a hard time in realizing that Puleo said PERIOD For me its black and white nobody should want to be associated with individuals who act in such manners. according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence an estimated . million women are victims of domestic violence by an intimate person each year PERIOD NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell executed a new policy giving first time violators of the leagues domestic abuse policy a sixgame unpaid ban while a second offense would now warrant a complete ban from the league PERIOD On the surface these changes appear to be progressive but the motivations for these actions seem to be rooted somewhere else PERIOD

Maybe in the end this complete blunder by the National Football League will finally prove to be a deciding factor in reshaping the way the league is formed and the priorities that drive their actions PERIOD In the meantime if the league doesnt undergo serious selfreflection sponsorships will be the least of their issues PERIOD
