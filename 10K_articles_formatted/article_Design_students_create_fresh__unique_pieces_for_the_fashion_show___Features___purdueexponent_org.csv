What made you interested in apparel design

I took basic sewing classes in middle school and high school where I did really simple projects PERIOD Even then I thought making something from scratch was so cool. what are you inspired by

Inspiration can strike me at any time whether I see something that triggers it or if it just randomly pops into my head PERIOD Of course I use Pinterest Tumblr and read many blogs as well PERIOD Im just always keeping my eyes open for anything that may spark a new idea. tell me about your collection PERIOD

Its based on Medieval influences PERIOD I really like outerwear so I started with the idea of a cape which evolved into the idea of a Queen. from there I researched Medieval life and fashion and formed the idea of my looks being based on different classes of Medieval society PERIOD

So basically my collection begins with The Peasant ends with The Queen and the rest of the characters come between. what is your favorite thing about fashiondesigning
