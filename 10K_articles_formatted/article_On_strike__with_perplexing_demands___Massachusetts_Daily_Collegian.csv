6104,2023-11-04,"a free and responsible press serving the UMass community since 

Let me preface everything Im about to say by stating that I am in full support of expanding scholarships and aid to lower income communities in Massachusetts  increasing student accessibility to student space and putting a stop to this seemingly arbitrary escalation of fees with no communication from the administration to students PERIOD The bureaucracy of this University hasnt served or even acknowledged the student population appropriately for a long time PERIOD And with a newlyelected Democratic governor who has openly made public higher education a priority there are plenty of tools and plans in the works that the University could take advantage of if it so chose PERIOD

I sympathize profoundly with almost all of the issues that close to a thousand students maybe even more voiced their concern over last week PERIOD But there was one issue that I felt seriously detracted from the seriousness of the other objections articulated by the strike the police presence in residence halls PERIOD

Ive been pulled over before Ive been questioned by an officer over stupid things PERIOD Ive even been treated rudely by UMPD officers PERIOD Theyre not always the most likeable population on campus PERIOD But I think its a little ludicrous to try and assert that there are routinely undercover or plainclothes police officers roaming the halls of every dorm on campus busting people for smoking a joint in their rooms or covering their smoke detectors PERIOD To think that this university actually employs enough people to pull that off is a little unrealistic PERIOD And I think the majority of these terrifying rumors stem from a total lack of awareness on the part of UMass students concerning the policies relating to their own security PERIOD This is unfortunate as I think it provides an opening for those who might wish to invalidate our other concerns PERIOD

As a resident of this campus for five semesters I have lived in three different residential areas and I have never once seen a police officer in a hallway that was not being escorted there by a resident an RA or some other emergency personnel PERIOD The majority of the time when I have met a cop in the hall he or she has been carrying an orange first aid kit and running to the aid of someone who more than likely would end up aspirating in his or her own vomit if there wasnt a police force on this campus that responds at the rate that they do PERIOD

And as for plainclothes officers  yeah Ive seen that too PERIOD In fact sometime in the unspecified past to protect the presumed innocence of those involved I witnessed one undercover officer and two uniformed officers arresting two individuals in a dorm at around  a.m PERIOD one day PERIOD I assumed that the undercover knocked said Candygram the door was opened and chaos ensued PERIOD I didnt have to assume what those two were being carried off for after numerous complaints about latenight knocking funny smells and a suspiciously large flat screen television victoriously loaded into their room about a week beforehand the conclusion was sufficiently obvious PERIOD Unfortunately members of the UMass community sometimes young people do stupid things make bad decisions and get themselves in trouble PERIOD

Much to their chagrin the RAs actually are the people who have to deal with our crap the majority of the time PERIOD Youd think that when it came to the complicated stuff theyd be happy to pawn off their responsibilities onto someone a little easier to vilify PERIOD Theres nothing more relieving than being able to shrug and say God that sucks Im sorry man as a resident is being written up by the UMPD for punching someone or being belligerent to the security monitor or drinking underage PERIOD

On that note Id like to say that I think a strike was probably the worst way to protest the police presence on campus PERIOD It obviously hasnt done much since this weekend our guys and gals in grey were out in force PERIOD It also doesnt sufficiently address what I think the real issue is a lack of knowledge as to what you can actually get in trouble for and under what circumstances PERIOD If students actually understood their rights and whats really expected of them there would be fewer silly pointless arrests and misunderstandings and everyones life would be a whole lot easier PERIOD So let me end with a few pieces of advice PERIOD

We are in the Pioneer Valley folks one of the most beautiful places in New England PERIOD If youre going to smoke the youknowwhat go hiking or something PERIOD Dont do it on campus where the  are lurking around every corner PERIOD Also be nice to the security monitors especially in the Southwest towers  they have radios that communicate directly to the police station and they dont appreciate rude drunk people hassling them especially if youre a freshman because then its pretty obvious youre not supposed to reek like Bacardi Razz PERIOD And if youre looking to make some quick money dont hang shoes out in front of your dorm window PERIOD
