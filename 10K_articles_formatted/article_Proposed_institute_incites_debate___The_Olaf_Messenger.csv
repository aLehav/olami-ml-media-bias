8961,2023-11-04,"for the first time its history St PERIOD Olaf will have an institute PERIOD Formally announced at the Student Government Association SGA Senate meeting on Dec PERIOD  The Institute for Freedom and Community will provide a major boost for the study of public affairs PERIOD Made possible by substantial donor funding the Institute has been a source of both excitement and controversy among the faculty PERIOD

According to Professor of Political Science Dan Hofrenning  who announced the development of the Institute to Senate and who has been one of its main supporters  this new program will both provide new opportunities for politicallyengaged students and raise the profile of political inquiry on campus PERIOD

The purpose of this project is to add to the list of wonderful things people think of when they think of St PERIOD Olaf to add public affairs politics and civic discourse to this list Hofrenning said PERIOD

One of the main features of the proposed Institute would be a Public Affairs Conversation open to juniors and seniors PERIOD In addition the Institute would host a yearly conference on constructive political dialogue and inquiry and would also bring in guest lecturers and visiting fellows PERIOD

Hofrenning imagines the Institute as not just a set of curricula but rather an environment that fosters civic discourse and social activism PERIOD

We want to include lots of debates and civil conversation he said PERIOD But we also want to make a statement that at some pointthere will be lots of issues where you will have to take a stand PERIOD We envisage a student that will get involved and take a stand. there has been some controversy regarding the Institutes implementation however PERIOD One issue involves the donor Dean Buntrock  who provided the majority of the money for the Institute PERIOD Buntrock has long been a financial supporter of St PERIOD Olaf as well as a member of the Board of Regents but was also the subject of a fraud charge by the SEC as the CEO of Waste Management in  PERIOD

There are also questions about the amount of faculty control on the Institutes content PERIOD The faculty usually controls curriculum but the Institutes unique nature poses some distinct issues PERIOD There is no existing bureaucratic structure for assessing institutes and some faculty are concerned about this lack of oversight PERIOD

Political Science Professor Kathy Tegtmeyer Pak believes that the Curriculum Committee should have had the responsibility of assessing and evaluating the new creation PERIOD

This is an entirely new thing for St PERIOD Olaf she said PERIOD We dont have a process for an institute that intends to be on both the curricular and noncurricular sides of the college. instead a task force of eight faculty members has been developing the Institute since last spring bypassing the standard elected committee structure PERIOD While the Curriculum Committee will eventually review the proposed classes the rest of the Institute was presented to the general faculty as essentially a finished product PERIOD Some faculty members consider this a problem as there exist several aspects of the Institute that many feel warrant further discussion especially the presence of the word freedom in the title PERIOD

Freedom has a conservative connotation in current U.S PERIOD politics and there is concern that the current title does not reflect the Institutes mission of broad based civic discourse PERIOD Political Science Professor Kris Thalhammer articulated these concerns PERIOD

If we want to attract speakers across a spectrum if we really want to have people who do sophisticated analysis of all sorts of different issues I worry that the title might send the signal that we have a particular agenda Thalhammer said PERIOD If the agenda is actually to have spirited and widespread discourse including conservative voices being heard but not exclusively I dont think thats the title I would have chosen. as an alternative title she suggested Institute for Public Civic Discourse but was not sure that a change was possible PERIOD

Im not getting a strong signal that its open to negotiation she said PERIOD

Tegtmeyer Pak also questioned the word choice in the title and emphasized that these types of discussions could have taken place through the normal channels PERIOD

Does freedom in the title set us up to have to think about particular kinds of things in the classroom Thats one of my questions she said PERIOD Thats one of the reasons I think it would be worthwhile to have this talked about through a normal process in the curriculum committee PERIOD So Im disappointed that the name isnt being treated as names are otherwise treated at the college. both Tagtmeyer Pak and Thalhammer emphasized that the Institute could very well be a positive development for civically engaged students and academic inquiry PERIOD But concerns about the Institutes implementation persist PERIOD Curriculum content should be within the domain of the faculty and in this case faculty may not have been allotted the proper amount of oversight PERIOD",Proposed institute incites debate â€“ The Olaf Messenger,St. Olaf College
