March marks the celebration of Womens History Month at UT as the Commission for Women hosts events all month long to educate students on issues of womens health equality and stereotypes to name a few all in hopes of getting students engaged in diverse thinking and open discussion on seemingly taboo topics PERIOD

On Wednesday afternoon Rosalinda Thomas the wellness coordinator at the Student Health Center on campus hosted a panel of experts including Dean Theresa Lee Anita Blatnik and Azieb Kidanu in the International House as they discussed the panel topic 

The purpose of this particular panel Thomas said was to get the women on campus aware of their physical emotional and psychological health while giving them a forum where they could ask questions and become educated on less openly discussed subjects concerning women PERIOD

 Thomas said PERIOD

Thomas invited women with expertise in each of the three fields to offer their insights to the women on campus PERIOD

The first to speak at the panel was Lee dean of the College of Arts and Sciences since last January PERIOD She spoke to the topic of sleep and revealed statistics to prove that college students women and men alike are dangerously sleep deprived PERIOD She encouraged students to sleep and to do it often PERIOD

 she said PERIOD

Lee explained that the brain transfers shortterm memories into longterm permanent memories while people sleep PERIOD

With significant research and credible sources Lee claimed that sleeping is not only vital to excellent academic performance but also to physical health as a whole PERIOD The less one sleeps the worse his or her ability to recall information becomes PERIOD

The panel took a turn when Thomas friend Kidanu public health educator for tobacco use prevention and control at the Knox County Health Department spoke to an issue affecting both women and the general student population  hookah smoking PERIOD She shared that she had partnered with Thomas and numerous other public health efforts on campus to tackle health issues such as hookah smoking PERIOD

Kidanu admitted that she hoped students would hear the lecture and recognize that smoking hookah could be harmful to them PERIOD

 Kidanu explained PERIOD 

Kidanu expounded that what makes smoking hookah worse than cigarette smoking is the fact that hookah users are not only putting tobacco and nicotine into their bodies but are also exposing themselves to coal combustion since hookah pipes are heated by coal PERIOD Kidanu hopes that once students hear the news they will be more concerned about their health than with participating in the trend PERIOD

The last panelist to speak was Blatnik the womens health nurse practitioner at Student Health Services PERIOD She encouraged students to practice healthy sexual habits as well as begin pledging to schedule yearly checkups PERIOD

 Blatnik said PERIOD 

Blatnik encouraged female students to use the Student Health Center as a resource and a place to talk and ask questions about normal womens health issues and to have access to further information PERIOD
