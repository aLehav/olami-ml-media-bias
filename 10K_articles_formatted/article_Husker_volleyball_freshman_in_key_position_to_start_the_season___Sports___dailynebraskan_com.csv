Freshman libero Justine WongOrantesis already making impression at new position PERIOD

The common theme for the Nebraska volleyball team this season will be having options PERIOD

According to Nebraska coach John Cook he will be able to use a lot of different players if someone is not performing well enough including at the libero position PERIOD

Cook said the starter at libero for this weekends tournament will be freshman Justine WongOrantes PERIOD The position will be hers to lose he said PERIOD

If shes playing well she gets to play Cook said PERIOD If shes not shes coming out PERIOD Thats the good thing about having four liberos. the Cypress Calif. native played setter for her entire high school career and won more matches than any player in her high school programs history PERIOD But the Huskers brought in junior Mary Pollmiller and freshman Kelly Hunter to take care of the setter position and Cook felt WongOrantes could step up to a challenge PERIOD

She is just a really good volleyball player probably the best volleyball player on our team the coach said PERIOD She is going to have to prove herself as a libero and set herself apart from everyone else if she wants that position. wongOrantes has set herself apart to earn the starting spot over sophomore Sheridan Zarda and freshmen Brenna Lyles and Alexa Ethridge PERIOD

Even though WongOrantes has the starting spot she still wants to learn more about the game PERIOD

I just really hope that no matter if I play or not I can just grow as a player WongOrantes said PERIOD

The 5foot6inch libero had her first experience playing as a Husker in last Saturdays RedWhite game and WongOrantes felt her anxiousness disappear as the game started PERIOD

I did have the nerves going into the RedWhite scrimmage but once I just start playing it just all goes away WongOrantes said PERIOD

Cook has already noticed this about the libero PERIOD

Weve been impressed with her composure and confidence level for a freshman the coach said PERIOD

In the RedWhite game WongOrantes recorded  digs and had three assists while playing in all three sets PERIOD She committed only one mistake misreading a shot that she thought was going out of play but landed next to her in play PERIOD

WongOrantes said she didnt realize she was going to get an offer to play for the Huskers but when she did receive it she knew what she wanted to do PERIOD

I think it was kind of a nobrainer WongOrantes said PERIOD I mean Nebraska has been in the top five like every year. wongOrantes didnt just come for the indoor volleyball but also for Nebraskas newest sport sand volleyball PERIOD The  year will be the second year for the Huskers in the growing sport of beach volleyball and WongOrantes is excited at the programs adoption of the sport PERIOD

The fact that they added sand volleyball is a complete bonus WongOrantes said PERIOD

At the age of  WongOrantes earned a AAA rating from the California Beach Volleyball Association and she is the youngest player to receive the ranking PERIOD She competed internationally in beach volleyball in  in the FIVB Beach Volleyball Swatch Youth World Championships PERIOD

Whether WongOrantes is indoors or out she just wants to help the team anyway she can PERIOD

Whether its passing or just going in to serve WongOrantes said I just hope I can contribute to the team and have some kind of role. sportsdailynebraskan.com
