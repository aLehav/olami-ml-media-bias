2844,2009-04-21,"braun With the NFL draft coming up this Saturday we get the chance to see where the best college players will land PERIOD Quarterbacks like Matthew Stafford Mark Sanchez and Pat White have been dominating football headlines over the past several weeks and its always a pleasure to watch the great young QBs grow over their time in the pros PERIOD

But its not as fun as watching them bust PERIOD

There are always those players who just cant get it done on the higher level and weve seen it firsthand PERIOD Our own Ron Dayne a former Heisman winner just wasnt the same after he was drafted PERIOD Obviously he didnt live up to his potential but hes not the only player in Wisconsin to be a big time bust PERIOD

He didnt play for UW but former Green Bay Packers offensive lineman Tony Mandarich was a machine for Michigan State PERIOD He made as many pancakes as IHOP and was even featured on Sports Illustrateds cover as The Incredible Bulk. now Im not saying its always fun to see people struggle but what is so intriguing about Mandarichs situation was the pure dominance he displayed in college which simply could not be replicated into NFL play PERIOD

Quarterbacks come and go but in a position comprised almost entirely of brute strength and quickness one should be able to predict whether someone will be a good offensive lineman PERIOD That is why Mandarich the most dominant lineman in the country in college is the biggest bust in NFL history PERIOD

Solochek While a guy whose claim to fame is to be big enough to eat an elephants weight in pancakes is cool that sure does not make him the biggest draft bust at all time PERIOD However if averaging  yards per game and throwing a  touchdown passes during your junior year then retiring about four years later isnt a bust then I dont know what is PERIOD

Of course I am talking about the esteemed career of former Washington State Cougar and San Diego Charger Ryan Leaf PERIOD

Coming out of college Leaf was so highly touted the Changers gave up two first round picks a secondround pick and two players on the roster just to be in the running for Leaf or Tennessee Volunteer Peyton Manning PERIOD Of course we all know how that ended up for both teams PERIOD

In his career as a Charger Leaf had a whopping quarterback rating of  while throwing  interceptions compared to only  touchdowns from  PERIOD After three years and only four wins the San Diego management had enough and released him PERIOD He was picked up by Tampa Bay in  but was dropped five days before the season even started and signed with the Cowboys who dropped him at the end of the season PERIOD

For all of the time money and subsequent draft picks invested in Leaf there is no way he is not the biggest draft bust of all time PERIOD
