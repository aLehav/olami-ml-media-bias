Every day freshman linebacker Stevenson Sylvester lines up to play football at the U is a good day PERIOD

At least thats the feeling you get when talking to the 18yearold Las Vegas native PERIOD

I love everything about the University of Utah and everything about this team PERIOD This is the environment and the place that I want to be Sylvester said after practice Tuesday PERIOD

Attitude isnt the only thing the freshman has going for him either PERIOD

Sylvester made quite a name for himself with coaches during summer workouts and spring training with his hard work and love for the game PERIOD

With the team now riddled with injuries those initial impressions coupled with intense athletic ability are turning into serious playing time for Sylvester PERIOD

We saw the talent immediately PERIOD It was very apparent the first day that he would be able to help this team U head coach Kyle Whittingham said PERIOD

That talent has led Sylvester to two starts  tackles one sack one forced fumble and an interception that he returned  yards for a touchdown PERIOD

The interception carried additional meaning as it was against Utah State which received a commitment from Sylvesters cousin Geno last spring PERIOD

That was pretty great PERIOD Weve been talking crap to each other ever since we signed the papers to go to college Sylvester said PERIOD That rivalry has always been pretty bad so I knew I had to give it my best and take it to him. that rivalry is one of many things that has fueled Sylvester into being a bigtime contributor for the Utes thus far this season PERIOD

Stevenson is willing to do whatever it takes for his team to be successful PERIOD Whether starting or not hes just happy to contribute linebacker coach Kalani Sitake said PERIOD He does a lot of things that other linebackers cant do athletically and that kind of makes up for his size and age. the size that Sitake is referring to is the freshmans 6foot2 205pound frame which is relatively small for a collegiate linebacker PERIOD

To fix that Sylvester has been on an inverted Jenny Craig plan of sorts PERIOD

Were waking him up early in the morning and basically forcefeeding him to get him to gain weight PERIOD Right now hes going against guys that are  pounds heavier than him Sitake said PERIOD

With Joe Jianonni coming back into the picture this week every pound will come into play as Sylvester works to maintain his starting position over the junior PERIOD

Jianonni sat out the last two games recovering from a foot injury but returns to the lineup this week PERIOD Before the injury Jianonni was the starting middle linebacker and will look to regain his starting position PERIOD

Its a battle PERIOD Its hard work and hard competition every day PERIOD We both want to play and both love this sport so much PERIOD Wed do anything to play Sylvester said PERIOD

For all of the tremendous upside in Sylvesters game his coaches believe there is still much the freshman has to work on PERIOD

Hes coming along well PERIOD Hes got ability and fire and thats a good place to start but hes still a long way away from being a true Division1 linebacker Whittingham said Hes got to put some meat on his frame but the athleticism is definitely there. cancel reply
