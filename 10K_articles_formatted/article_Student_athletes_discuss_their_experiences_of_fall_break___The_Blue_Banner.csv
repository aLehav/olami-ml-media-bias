Jared Feinberg Sports Writer emailprotectedOctober  

Fall break is a time for UNC Asheville students to relax and reset halfway through the fall semester PERIOD For studentathletes theyre in the middle of their respective seasons preparing for a competition or competing in events throughout the weekend PERIOD

Studentathletes bear a lot of responsibility regarding preparation and performance in the classroom and in competitions PERIOD When it comes to fall break some studentathletes may have just one or two days during the break to catch up on other responsibilities outside the ones they have in their respective sports while also trying to balance their social life as well PERIOD

Competing in sporting events during the fall break is never a bad thing especially when youre able to break records like senior crosscountry runner Johnathan Ciprich did that weekend PERIOD Ciprich broke the Bulldogs 8k record with a time of . in the Lou Classic in Louisville Kentucky PERIOD

Ciprich spent his downtime before and after the meet finishing up on homework and readings but that didnt stop him from grabbing some celebratory food after his recordsetting performance PERIOD

After getting back from the meet I immediately grabbed some Cook Out and then went home to do some homework PERIOD I also took time to watch some shows and do some reading after my crosscountry meet Ciprich said PERIOD

Once he finished his classroom responsibilities Ciprich was finally able to start a popular Netflix show that was recently released Dahmer  Monster The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. i started the Dahmer show and finished three episodes over the course of fall break to unwind from classes PERIOD I have been wanting to start this show for the past couple of weeks he said PERIOD

Ciprich said fall break was a time for him to refocus though he wishes the break was longer than just a four day weekend PERIOD

Fall break definitely allowed me time to recharge especially since it was merged with the weekend PERIOD I personally wish it was slightly longer but Im grateful that I had a chance to relax during the break said Ciprich PERIOD

Another studentathlete that competed during the fall break weekend was sophomore swimmer Chloe McDonald PERIOD UNCA defeated East Carolina University in their first dual meet of the season  PERIOD McDonald was a big part of the Bulldogs win over the Pirates finishing first in the 100yard fly PERIOD

McDonald said the energy on the pool deck was unmatched while also being pleased with her time of . in the 100yard fly PERIOD

This win was a collective effort and I could not be any more proud of this special group of ladies she said PERIOD

After the big win over their Atlantic Coastal Conference foe McDonald and her teammates went right back to work on Monday with a mileandahalf run along with three practices in two days PERIOD On Tuesday afternoon McDonald was able to spend her spare time with her teammates PERIOD

A lot of us went to an orchard treating ourselves to apple cider donuts fritters and all sorts of goodies said McDonald PERIOD

During the break McDonald decided to rewatch some old classic movies such as Good Will Hunting and When Harry Met Sally. let me tell you it was as great as the first time watching them PERIOD If youre looking for a cozy classic I highly suggest these especially if youre a sucker for romance PERIOD Plus theyre perfect for this time of year as they have a fall aesthetic to them McDonald said PERIOD

McDonald said fall break allowed her to sit back and reflect on the semester saying she was happy with her performance in the pool and in the classroom PERIOD

The sophomore said it can be easy to get overwhelmed as a studentathlete though the break gave her and others opportunities to reset and refocus PERIOD

For many I think it can be fairly easy to get overwhelmed especially when it seems like so many things are occurring at once and its always go go go PERIOD Having even two days off from school gave me along with others the opportunity to refocus on priorities and goals set for ourselves at the beginning of the semester McDonald said PERIOD

Senior midfielder and forward Andrew Rossetti said he spent his fall break with teammates and preparing for their matchup against Big South conference foe Longwood PERIOD Unfortunately due to inclement weather the match was rescheduled to Oct PERIOD  PERIOD

We had a game on Saturday vs PERIOD Longwood PERIOD Due to storms it was rescheduled PERIOD I had the weekend off and spent it working on midterms and other homework assignments Rossetti said PERIOD

Rossetti said he spent his time off getting caught up with a popular HBO Max show and watching football over the weekend PERIOD I got caught up on House of Dragons which was good PERIOD But besides that I didnt really watch anything specific he said PERIOD

However Rossetti did say he spent his Saturday off watching college football PERIOD

I love Georgia Bulldog football PERIOD So I watched their game against the Missouri Tigers PERIOD I also watched the Oklahoma Sooners vs PERIOD TCU Horned Frogs Rossetti said PERIOD

While a couple of days off were great Rossetti was able to catch up on some of his offthepitch responsibilities that many studentathletes have PERIOD

It was definitely relaxing to have two days off from soccer PERIOD During the season time just flies by PERIOD Having a couple of days to catch up on work shows grocery shopping and other things was super helpful Rossetti said PERIOD
