Cloudy skies early then off and on rain showers overnight PERIOD Low 42F PERIOD Winds SSE at  to  mph PERIOD Chance of rain  PERIOD

Updated November     pm















The artificial intelligence revolution is fully underway but soaring demand for its most crucial component has startups scratching their heads on how they can deliver on AIs promise PERIOD

Generative AIs lifeblood is a booksized semiconductor known as the graphics processing unit GPU  built by one company Nvidia PERIOD

Nvidias CEO and founder Jensen Huang made a wild bet years ago that the world would soon clamor for a powerful chip usually used for making video games but that could build AI as well PERIOD

No company working with the generative AI models that fuel todays frenzy can get off the ground without Nvidias singular product the latest model is the H100 and its accompanying software PERIOD

That painful reality is one that Amazon Intel AMD and others are scrambling to fix with their own alternatives but those attempts could take years PERIOD

And with the biggest tech companies throwing all their financial might into generative AI the smaller fish must go on the hunt to secure Nvidias holy grail PERIOD

 said Fangbo Tao cofounder of Mindverse.AI a Singaporebased startup PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

Tao spoke to AFP at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco where AI startups jostled to make their pitches to Silicon Valleys venture capitalists VC PERIOD

ChatGPT took the world by storm just as Silicon Valley was caught in a nasty hangover from the pandemic when investors threw money at startups convinced that life had gone irreversibly online PERIOD

That turned out to be farfetched and the US tech scene entered a downturn with rounds of layoffs and VC money dried up PERIOD

Thanks to AI some of the old mojo is back and anyone with those two letters on their resume will likely see a red carpet rolled out on the legendary Sand Hill Road home to Silicon Valleys most storiedinvestors PERIOD

But as the startups walk away with their VC cash the money in their pockets will be quickly forked out to Nvidia for GPUs either directly or through providers to bring their AI dreams to execution PERIOD

 said Laurent Daudet CEO of AI startup LightOn PERIOD

The problem is most acute for companies involved in training generative AI models which requires that power hungry GPUs work at peak capacity to process troves of data ingested from the internet PERIOD

The computing needs are so massive that only a few companies can stump up the cash to build one of these stateoftheart large language models PERIOD

The ten billion dollars investment by Microsoft into OpenAI is widely understood to be paid out as credits to access purposebuilt data centers humming with Nvidia GPUs PERIOD

Google has built its own models and now Amazon on Monday said it was pumping four billion dollars into Anthropic AI another company that trains AI PERIOD

Training on that mountain of data  said Said Ouissal CEO of Zededa a company that works on making AI less power hungry PERIOD

 added Wes Cummins CEO Applied Digital a company that supplies AI infrastructure PERIOD

Companies on the AI frontlines also point out that Nvidias primordial role makes it the defacto kingmaker on where the technology is going PERIOD

The market is  that have the  former Nvidia engineer Jacopo Pantaleoni told The Information PERIOD

 he said PERIOD

Some veterans of Silicon Valley said that the frenzied days of Nvidia GPUs will not last forever and that other options will inevitably emerge PERIOD

Or the cost of entry will prove too high even for the giants bringing the current boom down to earth PERIOD
