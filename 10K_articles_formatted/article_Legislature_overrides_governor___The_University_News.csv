3659,2018-10-10,"the Missouri House of Representatives voted on Thursday to
override Governor Bob Holdens veto of a bill promoting serious
reflection on the decision to have or not to have an abortion PERIOD

The bill which passed in both the state House and Senate
easily requires women to receive a doctors consultation and
observe a 24hour waiting period before undergoing any abortion
procedure PERIOD

The new law stipulates that women must be screened for risk
factors that may increase adverse reactions to the abortion PERIOD Both
the woman and her examiner must sign a statement verifying that the
woman has been informed of the risks involved and has not been
coerced into the procedure PERIOD

This statement will go into her medical file which is covered
by confidentiality statutes PERIOD

If she chooses the woman may return  hours later to have the
abortion PERIOD

Missouris new measure is not unique  other states have laws
requiring waiting periods before abortion procedures PERIOD The decision
does not go against existing Missouri law the state books declare
that life begins at conception PERIOD

Additional laws prohibit hospitals from performing and state
funds from supporting abortions not required to save a womans
life PERIOD

In light of this scientific fact many believe that the veto
override is a good thing PERIOD

The time period will give mothers a little more opportunity
to reflect on the choice at hand  to realize whats going on
inside their bodies and that there is an actual human life at
stake said Lucy Steele treasurer of SLU Students for Life PERIOD

Her sentiments reflect those of the bills supporters in the
Missouri state legislature PERIOD

Rep PERIOD Wayne Cooper M.D. said As a physician I say this is
only a  modest wait for a very very heavy decision. opponents of the bill have voiced concern that it makes no
exceptions for cases of rape or incest PERIOD

They also say that imposition of a waiting period increases the
difficulty of obtaining abortions for women in rural areas PERIOD Still
others insist that the bill underestimates women themselves PERIOD

Its as if the woman did not have enough sense to make the
decision in the first place said Rep PERIOD Barbara Fraser PERIOD

However the rationale behind the passing of the bill is that it
will provide more time resources and empowerment for women to come
to an informed decision PERIOD

One woman who regretted her decision to abort her baby testified
before the Missouri legislature prior to the passing of the
bill PERIOD

She put it this way In many cases pro choice becomes no
choice for women who havent really had the chance to consider
their choice. your donation will support the student journalists of Saint Louis University PERIOD Your contribution will help us cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
