3152,2023-11-04,"coming into the seasonseniorgoalie Sarah Priem had never missed a game for the Marquette womens lacrosse team PERIOD That changed when head coach Meredith Black decided to start backup senior goalie Emma Salter against Central Michigan earlier this year PERIOD Normally if Salter plays she comes in to relievePriem in the second half PERIOD

After this had becomea habit over the past three years Black was surprised when Priem refused to enter the game at halftimewhen the Golden Eagles held a commanding  lead PERIOD

Priem told me Absolutely I dont want to play I want Emma to play Black said PERIOD Sarah stepped down PERIOD Shes the only player that didnt play that game that was healthy PERIOD I was very touched to watch how that played out. priem ranked among the top  goalies by ESPN coming out of high school is known as the most competitive player on the team PERIOD She said she struggled early in her career understanding why she got pulled from games PERIOD As a senior now she says she has matured and her mindset has changed from Ill do anything to play to Ill do anything to win. now I see everyones perspectives more and I respect everyone and know how good they are Priem said PERIOD Im always excited when Salter goes in and I know she will help us win. salter has been a member of the program since it began PERIOD She came to Marquette for the nursing program and decided to play because of the excitement of starting a new program PERIOD She had thetough job of backing upPriem and Salter admits it was something she struggled coming to terms with PERIOD

Its not easy PERIOD There have been days that I didnt want to play anymore Salter said PERIOD It was a reality check but I learned its important for me to stay mentally strong. just like Priem Salter says she has grown during her time at Marquette PERIOD She learned to become mentally tough and to look on the bright side PERIOD Coming into her last season at Marquette she wanted to have more positive energy PERIOD She takes pride in competing at practice and helping the team improve however she can PERIOD Despite her lack of playing time Black and the team view Salter as a crucial member of the team PERIOD

I think everyone would agree that she is one of the most important players on our team Black said PERIOD Emma brings the energy to our program PERIOD Shes super vocal and energetic and she brightens every single persons day every day. salter said she takes it upon herself to keep a positive energy surrounding the team PERIOD

I call myself the energy queen she said PERIOD I take it as a big role and I believe it helps our team. the two goalies admit playing togetherhas challenged them to work harder PERIOD Priem said she has embraced having to competefor the starting spot PERIOD She said she realizes how good Salter is and that it hasnt allowed her to take any days off PERIOD

At every practice I have to come and compete because my spot isnt guaranteed Priem said PERIOD It makes me more competitive and that translates in the game PERIOD Shes really pushed me to become a better goalie. both have battled emotions and Black says it was tough for them to accept their roles PERIOD Taking a step back to look at how things unfolded is something special PERIOD Black said watching the two respond and mature over the first four years of the program has been remarkable PERIOD

To have two goalies at that caliber that our attack gets to shoot at every day has been a blessing Black said PERIOD We get it all PERIOD Ive loved every second of it. the student news site of Marquette University
