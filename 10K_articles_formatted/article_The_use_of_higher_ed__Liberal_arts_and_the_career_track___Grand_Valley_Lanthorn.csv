I have a variety of friends who guided either by thoughtful prudence or deep wisdom pursue both practical and impractical majors in college PERIOD The combinations theyve chosen are numerous journalism and biomedical science philosophy and business Spanish and biology math and English writing and chemistry PERIOD Despite the differences of their respective disciplines each of these students straddles a line that has been drawn by others the line between practical and impractical majors useful and useless disciplines careeroriented education and well not PERIOD

I will say very little about the questionable validity of this line of division one of the only points now worth making concerns its dubious applicability to a constantly shifting job market PERIOD For example in high school I was told a major in business or STEM was just about the one truly practical course of study in college PERIOD Only one teacher the head of the foreign language department said otherwise PERIOD Yet we now find that great jobs can be had almost anywhere on the globe including of course the U.S. if you speak two or three languages PERIOD Perhaps then the line between practical and impractical majors is drawn based to a certain extent on imagined job market conditions PERIOD

The issue I want to bring to light however concerns the effect of this dividing line on the kind of education offered at Grand Valley PERIOD Disregarding the question of its validity the dividing line undoubtedly influences the educational attitudes of students faculty and administrators PERIOD Based on this line students choose to enter certain majors professors define the marketing strategy of their disciplines and administrators establish the goals and direction of the university PERIOD In other words departments compete for students based on this dividing line and students enter college with the line already in mind PERIOD As a result if students choose a major immediately their instinct is to rush through college so as not to accrue heavy debt and to evade classes that do not relate to their practical majors PERIOD

But does the practical approach to higher education resonate with the mission of our university Grand Valley defines itself as a liberal arts institution committed to teaching and forming students before producing research PERIOD Thus it is evident that the administration in some way values the interdisciplinary approach to study in which students by taking a variety of courses in seemingly unrelated disciplines become wellrounded thinkers PERIOD The virtue of this approach stems from its focus on the intellectual growth of each student in lieu of the trappings of operating as a major research institution PERIOD

Nevertheless many students consider the liberal arts approach an impediment to their progress toward more practical ends a career a good starting salary etc PERIOD And of course the goal of having a stable career is not in any way misguided quite the opposite it would be foolhardy not to take such obviously practical ends into consideration PERIOD The issue however concerns a disconnect between theory and practice in theory the university provides each student a transformative education in the liberal arts in practice students shirk such a pursuit because it is not obviously useful or practical PERIOD

But there is an exception to the rule the students who by majoring in both practical and impractical majors seem to have found a via media PERIOD These students who study both philosophy and business biomed and English might do so for a number of reasons they have a passion for both subjects they want to reconcile the two they just cant for the life of them decide PERIOD Or maybe its that they recognize the importance of a liberal education and choose to major in an ostensibly impractical subject in order to reap the benefits it has on their intellect and character PERIOD I suspect in any case that these students have internalized a major premise of the liberal arts that the use of an education has little to do with its practicality PERIOD

If Grand Valley is to succeed in its expressed mission it ought to highlight the successes of such students PERIOD Otherwise its mission in the liberal arts will for the majority of students remain unrealized PERIOD
