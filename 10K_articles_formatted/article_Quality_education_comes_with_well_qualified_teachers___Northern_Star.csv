Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

By  Keith CameronNovember  

It would seem obvious that the adage Whatever you do do it well is applicable for everything in life PERIOD After all the better you do something the more you and everyone else benefits PERIOD This however may no longer be true for the pursuit of education PERIOD Today a higher degree carries with it the consequences of lower job opportunity PERIOD

As a student of NIU pursuing a career in teaching I thought I was immune to this phenomenon PERIOD However after phoning one of the few teachers from my high school with whom I still converse he confirmed this situation was true PERIOD

The way the system works is on a scale of across and down he said PERIOD

This means a teacher is ranked across by degree and then down by how much that degree will cost a school district PERIOD In essence the higher the degree the more a school district pays anyone it hires PERIOD

The other factor to consider in this situation is that every school district has different hiring capabilities PERIOD When it comes to public education a district is funded by the state and federal government but mostly by tax money generated from local communities PERIOD Illinois ranks at the bottom of federal funding for education according to the State Board of Educations Web site PERIOD Schools are more affected by the economies of the towns around them and to be blunt poor communities cannot afford to hire teachers who cost more money PERIOD As a result higher education can suffer in communities that need it the most PERIOD

It is arguably a common belief that the most qualified applicant be hired leaving office politics aside PERIOD I would also argue that a teacher with a higher degree would not necessarily be better at teaching but at least more informed on the subject matter they want to teach PERIOD

When I spoke with Judy CoxHenderson a liberal arts and sciences coordinator on the subject she said she usually advises students to get their masters degree after they start teaching PERIOD Even when it comes to teaching a job is just a means of getting by PERIOD It has become a means to make money and ensure survival but cost should not be the deciding factor when it comes to hiring especially in the educational field PERIOD

I applaud the idea of paying teachers more money after they obtain a higher degree but limiting a teachers chance of being hired because of increased education seems backwards PERIOD

Consider this We live in a country where the value of education is always a societal concern PERIOD A few years ago the Bush administration put through the No Child Left Behind Act and Gov PERIOD Blagojevich has been emphasizing the importance of education even at the preschool level PERIOD

However despite the good intentions of our leaders students now accrue massive debt PERIOD According to the Illinois State Board of Educations Web site the graduation rate is only . percent and standardized testing shows that just two years ago the average ACT score in Illinois was . out of  PERIOD How can we be so concerned with the value of education and yet overlook the quality of our teachers Is it a viable solution to now restrict quality for expense The answer is obvious PERIOD Quality will result in quality PERIOD If we want a higher standard for education then we must ensure a higher quality of teacher in the classroom PERIOD
