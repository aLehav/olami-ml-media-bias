The members of PomonaPitzers mens track team awoke last Saturday morning to blue skies and alreadyrising temperatures PERIOD Unfortunately they had to spend the majority of the day at Claremont McKennaamong Claremont Mckennaitesand whats more they had to participate in the notalwaysdelightful festivities of a track and field meet PERIOD

This meet was the last before the SCIAC Championships at the end of April which will be hosted by PomonaPitzer PERIOD Team scoring was done as a series of dual meets between the four competing programs PERIOD If these were crosscountry scoreswhere the lowest point total winsthe Sagehens would have swept the meet coming up  against CMS  against La Verne and  against Caltech PERIOD

A number of performances stood out for the Hens however with many season bests on both the track and the field PERIOD

Greg Hook PZ  and Zak Feldman PO  placed third and fourth in the  running . and . respectively PERIOD Feldmans time was a lifetime best and moved him up to eleventh in the conference PERIOD Will Forrester PO  also ran a season best in the  hurdles clocking . in fifth place and moving up to eleventh in SCIAC as well PERIOD

On the field Michael Grier PO  matched his season best in the high jump by clearing  feet . inches placing him fifth in the meet PERIOD He remains at fifth among all eight SCIAC teams PERIOD Matt Owen PZ  placed fifth in the pole vault moving up to tenth in the league PERIOD He cleared  feet . incheshis season best by an astounding . inches PERIOD

The most exciting event of the meet was undoubtedly the  in which four athletesone from La Verne two from CMS and one from PPran times within . seconds of one another all between  and  PERIOD Colin Flynn PZ  was leading the race and looking strong with  meters to go before being passed by three runners one after the other PERIOD Flynn pulled wide with  meters to go though and slowly edged up to and then passed two dying Stags PERIOD Michael Sacoto of La Verne managed to hold on for the win with Flynn coming in second in a time of . his secondbest time of the season PERIOD

The  was a fairly painful eventnot only for those running but likely also for those watching the  men attempt to finish a 12andahalf lap race as quickly as possible in 92degree Claremont heat PERIOD Although Alex Johnson PZ  was able to finish in a respectable . for fourth after leading in the early laps two of the four competing Sagehens dropped out and watched their teammates complete the race from the sidelines PERIOD

PPs resident Swede Anders Crabo PO  was conspicuously out of uniformand as such conspicuously welldressedon Saturday PERIOD Also noticeable was his slight limp and a wellwrapped knee PERIOD

The twotime SCIAC steeplechase champion raced two days earlier at the highly competitive Mt PERIOD SAC Relays which features hundreds of the fastest high school collegiate and postcollegiate athletes from around the country and world PERIOD Crabo covered the first  meters of the 3000meter steeplechase with a somewhat controlled effort before picking up the pace notably PERIOD He appeared to be heading toward or at least close to an automatic qualifying time for DivisionIII Nationals of under  but with  meters to go he hit his knee hard on a barrier and went down PERIOD

The experienced Cock regained composure after a moment jumped to his feet and continued on finishing in a seasonbest time of . pERIOD It was not the qualifying time he had hoped for but he clearly showed the potential for such a finish in the near future PERIOD The kneebarrier collision however prevented Crabo from competing again on Saturday at CMS PERIOD

With just one week left before this springs SCIAC Championships the rest of the Sagehens are also making their last preparations and resting up for their biggest competition of the season thus far PERIOD For most it also represents the last of  PERIOD For those chasingor already having caughtqualifying marks to nationals though races continue on into May PERIOD
