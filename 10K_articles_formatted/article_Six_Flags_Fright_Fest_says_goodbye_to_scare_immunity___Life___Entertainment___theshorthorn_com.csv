Thrills by Day the new element at Six Flags Fright Fest will take place during the day before transitioning at  p.m PERIOD to Fright by Night PERIOD Fright Fest starts Saturday at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington PERIOD

This years Fright Fest at Six Flags is anticipated to be the scariest one yet PERIOD

Theres a new element happening at the park PERIOD Thrills by Day will take place during the day but at  p.m PERIOD an alarm will sound and Fright by Night will begin PERIOD Bruce Mather Entertainment and Events Manager said its called The Awakening PERIOD

The Awakening is when zombies and other creatures will come out to frighten all the guests PERIOD

Thats right all the guests PERIOD

Kinesiology freshman Rachel Agostino plans to attend this year for the first time because her mom got season passes PERIOD Although she is hopeful this year will be scarier she doesnt think the scare factor will be too intense PERIOD

Youll still probably sleep at night but youll probably be startled Agostino said PERIOD

In previous years guests have been able to carry a boo stick and be safe from being scared PERIOD This year no one will be able to avoid being a target of the terror because Six Flags has done away with the boo sticks. a new parental advisory has gone up on the Six Flags website and Mather said parents certainly need to be aware that the entertainment after  p.m PERIOD may be too intense for young children PERIOD

Theres no immunity after  oclock Mather said PERIOD We are upping the scare factor by I would say  percent if not more. six Flags held auditions in August trying to find  singers dancers goblins ghouls and zombies PERIOD Mather said they were also looking for dance troupes for their show Dead Mans Party. its kind of Stomp meets the zombies Mather said PERIOD

Those who auditioned were asked to do a cold read of poems many by Edgar Allan Poe as scary as they could PERIOD

Other requirements are to have the right attitude and look PERIOD

Weve kind of relaxed our grooming codes a little bit for our zombies Mather said PERIOD Piercings are something that were allowing during Fright Fest. casting is now complete with some exceptions for a few of the goblins ghouls and zombies PERIOD

They have just a love for doing haunted houses and scaring people Mather said PERIOD

Agostino said zombies dont really have an effect on her but the things that truly frighten her are more spiritual occurrences PERIOD

It has to be the spirituallike creepy like the door closing kind of stuff Agostino said PERIOD

Some students said they havent been impressed by Six Flags previous attempts at horror but they are hopeful for this year PERIOD

Nursing freshman Marianna Gonzalez said that Fright Fest wasnt scary when she visited in sixth grade PERIOD She said Fright Fest could use more pop culture like references to recently released horror movies PERIOD

Gonzalez said she liked the costumes when she went last time and she may go this year because it would be interesting to see what they do to make it scarier PERIOD

Agostino is excited about Six Flags having the type of entertainment that will interest an older audience and not just kids PERIOD

We just invite everybody to come out and experience a whole new Fright Fest Mather said PERIOD
