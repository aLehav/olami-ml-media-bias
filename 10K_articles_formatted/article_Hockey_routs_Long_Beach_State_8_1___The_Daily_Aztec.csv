Meet the District  supervisor candidate Amy Reichert

San Diego State hockey had their second win of the weekend with a  victory over Long Beach State on Nov PERIOD  at the Joan Kroc Center PERIOD

The Aztecs were able to notch their second victory despite being on tired legs after a  victory over crosstown rival UC San Diego on Friday Nov PERIOD  at The Rinks Poway ICE PERIOD

Aztecs defender Brian Milner grabbed possession of the puck two minutes into the first period and took a shot to score giving SDSU its first point of the night PERIOD

Seconds later Long Beach State  PAC  Conference proved that they were still in the game as forward Francis Lemay had a breakaway drive that led to a oneonone shot on Aztecs goalie Nick Ilvento PERIOD Lemay took a backhand shot that went right past Ilvento to even the game at  PERIOD

Aztec forward Artem Klein got his team back in the lead by taking a shot to score with  minutes remaining in the first period PERIOD

Despite the Aztecs having the lead Long Beach State was able to maintain an equal amount of possession over the puck PERIOD It was a backandforth effort between the two teams PERIOD

With three minutes remaining in the first period Milner took a double minor penalty to give the 49ers a power play for four minutes PERIOD This put Long Beach in position to take control of the game PERIOD

SDSU forward Devyn Taras refused to allow that to happen as he took possession of the puck drove it down the rink and passed to forward Andrew Hoy who scored a shorthanded goal PERIOD

That got our whole bench going SDSU head coach Phil Bateman said PERIOD Devyn and Andrew generated the energy and we never let up after that. devyns breakaway moment led him to be named the SDSU player of the game PERIOD

The Aztecs  PAC  Conference carried that energy into the second period from the moment the puck dropped PERIOD Sophomore forward Derian Theberge came into Long Beach territory with force taking a shot that bounced off of goalie Adam Moroz PERIOD Forward Mickey Sullivan was right there to take the rebound shot to score PERIOD

Less than  seconds later Theberge found Sullivan again who took a shot to get his second goal of the night PERIOD

Derian had a good move and I was right where he passed it and it all worked out there PERIOD It felt really good Sullivan said of the goal PERIOD

Bateman added that Sullivan and Theberge played together all last year on their freshman line PERIOD

Those two goals on the same shift really came off a pattern that they remember from each other he said PERIOD

The scoring deficit forced Long Beach to have a goalie change as they pulled out Moroz and put in Brandon Rex PERIOD

The goalie change was still not enough for Long Beach to withhold the Aztecs as Hoy took a shot that gave him his second goal of the night PERIOD The Aztecs ended the second period with a fivegoal lead PERIOD

As the third period began the SullivanTheberge line was able to make a connection yet again PERIOD This time Sullivan passed to defender Adrien Wisch who found Theberge PERIOD Theberge scored the Aztecs seventh goal of the night PERIOD

Mickey and I have played together before PERIOD We played all last year PERIOD We finally got to play on a line together again this game and it was a lot of fun Theberge said PERIOD

The Aztecs added one final goal from senior forward Aaron Meyer to end the game with an  victory over Long Beach and clinch  wins on the season PERIOD

This team in its history has never hit  wins PERIOD Were at  and  right now PERIOD The team knows that and they want to be that team PERIOD Were hoping to get to  on the season Bateman said PERIOD

SDSU will next visit Long Beach State on Dec PERIOD  in Lakewood hoping to get its nineteenth win of the season PERIOD",Hockey routs Long Beach State 8-1 â€“ The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
