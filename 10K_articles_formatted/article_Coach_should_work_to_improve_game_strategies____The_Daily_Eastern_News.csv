Head basketball coach Rick Samuels is going to be around for his twenty-fifth consecutive season at Eastern PERIOD Director of Athletics Rich McDuffie has already made that determination but Samuels needs to take a close look at the department PERIOD



Samuels has to find a way to improve aspects of the basketball team before they even step on the Lantz Arena floor PERIOD

Problem number one is recruiting or the lack there of PERIOD

Samuels decided to go the junior college route for this years team that ended the season  overall and  in conference play PERIOD

The immediate problem now is that Eastern is way behind other instate midmajor schools when it comes to recruiting PERIOD

Southern Illinois is  this season ranked fifteenth in the nation and will be able to go into any home in America to sell their basketball program PERIOD By the way the Salukis are coached by former Eastern assistant Matt Painter PERIOD

Northern Illinois has struggled this season but under head coach Rob Judson the Huskies have an excellent recruiting class ready to hit Dekalb next season PERIOD As a former Illinois assistant Judson proved he can keep instate recruits at home and will continue to do so over the next few years PERIOD

This provides a serious problem for Samuels and his staff when fighting for talent even in our own backyard PERIOD

The real puzzle for Samuels and company is keeping that young energetic recruiter on his staff for long periods of time PERIOD

Enter Barry Stevens Easterns firstyear assistant PERIOD Unless Samuels can get these type of coaches to stick around the program Eastern will be in limbo in the way of recruiting PERIOD

However help is on the way PERIOD

Jake Byne a 6foot8inch forward out of Missourim is averaging  points and  rebounds per game in his senior season of high school but he is being compared to departing senior Jesse Mackinson PERIOD The Panthers currently have a need for a big strong center in the post and a point guard with leadership skills PERIOD

Unless these answers occur during the recruitment season this year Eastern fans can anticipate another lackluster performance at Lantz Arena PERIOD

Samuels has large tasks ahead of him PERIOD
