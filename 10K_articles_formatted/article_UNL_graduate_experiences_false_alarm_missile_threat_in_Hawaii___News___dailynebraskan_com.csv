Hawaiian residents and visitors went into a panic for more than half an hour on Saturday Jan PERIOD  after receiving notifications warning them of an incoming missile PERIOD

BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII PERIOD SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER it said PERIOD THIS IS NOT A DRILL. university of NebraskaLincoln graduate Julia Nguyen however did not get the notification and remained asleep PERIOD Around  a.m PERIOD she was woken up by her roommates who told her they needed to seek shelter PERIOD

It was really scary Nguyen said PERIOD I didnt really know how to process it just because I was so disoriented already. nguyen who graduated in December is now part of work exchange program Workaway PERIOD She had just arrived on the island of Oahu three days earlier PERIOD

Everyone is relatively new to the island and the program manager wasnt on the site at the time Nguyen said PERIOD We literally had no idea what to do. nguyen said she lives in the countryside where there are not many people PERIOD She said her main source of information was Twitter where she first learned it was a false alarm PERIOD

It was a lot of wordofmouth stuff Nguyen said PERIOD I was just frantically looking at posts from The Washington Post and The New York Times. according to Nguyen most people in Hawaii are wondering how something this serious could happen accidentally PERIOD

I was out in a touristy part of Hawaii yesterday and we heard a lot of side chatter she said PERIOD Theres just a lot of hysteria. in the wake of the incident Nguyen said she isnt concerned about staying on the island though the threat of an actual missile crisis will still be there PERIOD

I dont think fear should get in the way of doing whatever it is you want to do she said PERIOD

Nguyens sister Alice however said she is concerned for Julia PERIOD Alice a freshman global and environmental studies major said it makes her nervous that if something were to happen to Julia she couldnt do anything about it PERIOD

It could happen again and it could not be a false alarm Alice said PERIOD Im very worried that something could happen to her because shed be so far away. although the incident was nervewracking it was also eyeopening for Alice who said it made her realize she needs to show appreciation for the people in her life PERIOD

I dont want to say it was a blessing in disguise but it almost was she said PERIOD I need to make sure everyone knows that I love and appreciate them PERIOD And if anything were to happen I wouldnt have any regrets of not telling them. newsdailynebraskan.com
