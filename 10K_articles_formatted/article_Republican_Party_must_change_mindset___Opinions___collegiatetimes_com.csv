Every political party has identifying characteristics  some good some bad PERIOD Unfortunately sometimes the bad overshadows the good and the Republican Party in this case is no exception PERIOD

For starters Republicans are currently struggling for their partys legitimacy in the political arena PERIOD After the 16day shutdown the approval rating for Republicans is at a dismally low  percent according to the NBCWSJ poll  lower than President Obamas at  percent PERIOD

From what America has seen recently Republicans problems stem mostly from their unwillingness to accept change and elect compromise PERIOD

During the  recession it seemed as if the GOP stuck too stringently to their principles most were not in favor of the federal bailout which ended up saving thousands of American jobs and thwarted a very possible fallout in the US economy PERIOD

The Grand Old Party is a tormented party with discord abound PERIOD It appears they are under a constant identity crisis PERIOD Republicans are divided by those on the radical right Tea Partiers and the more moderate RepublicansRINOs Republican In Name Only PERIOD

If one party can be so divided how can they be expected to do their jobs and contribute to the betterment of society The government shutdown cost the US billions of dollars not counting the thousands of Americans out of work over a partisan temper tantrum PERIOD

It also showed us the GOPs obsession with principle and the resistance to change that continually plagues their decision making PERIOD In short they stick to their guns not worrying about what happens as long as they can maintain their principles PERIOD

From a nonpartisan standpoint it is upsetting to see this blatant display of narrowmindedness running amok in U.S PERIOD politics PERIOD

Partisanship however is a fault of Democrats also it only seems more evident and damning for the GOP considering Democrats have had great success recently in elections PERIOD

Republicans on paper arent the most openminded PERIOD This does not speak for every Republican but it seems many fail to realize that American voters do not consist of only white males PERIOD The politicians in office are supposed to represent and reflect the views of their constituents but the Republican Party has divorced from this notion and has time and time again shown a dedication to party principles over those of the people PERIOD

What might serve as the saving grace for the Republican Party would be a shift in demographics and flexibility on social issues that are rapidly becoming mainstays in American culture like gay marriage and immigration reform PERIOD

Perhaps their main problem is golden age thinking they tend to shy away from progressivism in an attempt to salvage a defunct idealized semblance of what America was in the past PERIOD

This struggle to hold on to the America that once was puts them in a bad light PERIOD To me it is a display of their refusal to accept how society is an evolving organism PERIOD

Again Republicans are not the only ones to blame but its the partisanship that creates vitriol and distrust in American politics  it doesnt look like things are changing anytime soon PERIOD
