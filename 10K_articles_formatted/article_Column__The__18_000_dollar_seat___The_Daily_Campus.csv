UConns plans for a new hockey arena will cost  million and have a maximum of  seats if expanded PERIOD File Photo The Daily Campus

Im back PERIOD And Im going to keep fighting the good fight PERIOD

A story came out in the Hartford Courant today that highlighted the numbers surrounding the official plans for a new hockey rink on the UConn campus PERIOD

In case you havent heard about these plans theyre ridiculous PERIOD

Our lovely university has proposed the construction of an oncampus hockey rink located right where the current Freitas Ice Forum is located PERIOD The arena would only be used for at most half the teams home games per season PERIOD Even better the plan is for the arena to have a capacity of just  falling short of the Hockey Easts capacity minimum requirement of  seats PERIOD

So why waste your time UConn More importantly why waste the  million dollars

Yes you heard me right PERIOD Itll be  million dollars for an arena thatll still be below the leaguerequirement and host only half the home games PERIOD

Sure its a requirement for every Hockey East team to have an oncampus arena PERIOD So why would UConn spend  million on a haphazard arena Im going to repeat that number  million dollars PERIOD For  seats PERIOD

But wait Theres hope According to the university the arena will be constructed to allow renovations to push capacity up to  PERIOD So still  below the league requirement PERIOD What a joyous day that will be

A capacity of  would bump UConn from dead last in oncampus arena capacity to thirdfromlast passing Merrimack and Providence PERIOD Mind you the Huskies have had some of the highest fanattendance numbers since starting Hockey East play in  PERIOD

Ignore the capacity numbers for a second PERIOD The way the school plans to pay for this arena should be enough to scrap the project PERIOD

According to the Courant the school will pull . million from their own funds and another  million from the recent sales of the UConn West Hartford branch and the Nathan Hale Inn PERIOD The remainder is where it gets complex PERIOD The school plans to hire a developer for the project the developer is planning on forming a special purpose entity that will essentially design construct own and operate the new arena PERIOD This company will pay for the rest of the construction PERIOD

UConn and this entity will be entering a 30year lease in return in which the school will be paying an annual fee of anywhere between . to . million a year PERIOD Basically the school will be paying at least  million over the next three decades to maintain the rink as a separate entity operates and manages it PERIOD

Everything about this plan is wrong PERIOD If the school isnt going to build this arena the right way dont build it at all PERIOD
