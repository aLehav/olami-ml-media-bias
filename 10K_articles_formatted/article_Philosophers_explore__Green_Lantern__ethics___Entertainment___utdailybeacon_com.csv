The Green Lantern

Just when fans think they are getting a little too  about their favorite television show or comic book hero something like the new book  brings them back down to earth PERIOD

 released May  and just in time for the new movies June  release proves to any fan of the comic book series that there are people out there thinking more critically about it PERIOD

From its title do not assume this is a runofthemill pop culture essay book full of just random musings of fans PERIOD This book is packed with legitimate articles authored by professors Ph.D candidates and graduate students PERIOD Each article has a sometimesextensive bibliography at the end and nearly every article involves some longwinded philosophical definitions and breezy introductions to the thoughts of Immanuel Kant Plato Aristotle and the like PERIOD

In fact where the book most suffers is when it delves too deeply in explanations of philosophy and too lightly on the philosophical analysis of Green Lantern PERIOD GL fans are going to buy the book to read interesting scholarly takes on their favorite characters not to learn about philosophical underpinnings PERIOD Some knowledge is necessary but the book has to keep it at the absolute basics PERIOD Some chapters attempt to go too far in philosophy education trying to make more of  pages than is possible PERIOD

The book excels at analyzing wide varieties of takes on the Green Lantern character PERIOD Most of course center on Green Lantern Hal Jordan and the current series of comic books but the book looks at Jordan from the perspective of comics from his  introduction all the way to today PERIOD

One article looks at a story line from the early 2000s when Kyle Rayner was the only ringslinger PERIOD Another analyzes Green Lantern John Stewart from the animated series 

Not to sound too geeky but some of the ideas presented in the book are fascinating PERIOD In particular one chapter entitled  looks at why Jordan constantly creates with his ring ordinary boxing gloves and giant fists when he has seen so much of the universe and could come up with anything his mind could imagine PERIOD

The chapter essentially concludes that because imagination is based on experience and repetition it would be the Earthy ordinary objects which Jordan has had the most experience and repetition with that he would create the most often PERIOD Hey that actually makes a lot of sense PERIOD

Another chapter  actually compares Plato to Green Lantern and Aristotle to Green Arrow by looking at Platos advocacy of censorship and Aristotles upholding of the worth of art PERIOD The chapter analyzes the legendary 1970s run of  by Denny ONeil and Neal Adams PERIOD

Other chapters look at the contradicting oaths that doctorGreen Lantern Soranik Natu has pledged herself to as well as the question of how planets insects and mathematical equations can serve as Green Lanterns PERIOD

While the book is probably best read slowly maybe a chapter a day  is an interesting and creative read a musthave for hardcore fans of the characters PERIOD

Other books in the  series focus on comics like   and  and television shows like     and 

According to the  section of this book a  book is forthcoming and everything about that sounds awesome PERIOD
