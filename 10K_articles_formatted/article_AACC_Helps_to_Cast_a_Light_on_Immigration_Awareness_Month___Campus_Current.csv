The idea here is that Islmaophobia is a big problem said Christopher Ballengee instructor of Performance Arts and the coordinator of the AACC Muslim Oral History Project PERIOD Muslims who are also American face a big problem sometimes just for living their beliefs PERIOD Especially for women who wear the hijab or otherwise cover themselves face discrimination all the time out in public since they are more visibly Muslim than other nonMuslim women who they work with who they go to school with. after the discussion panel finishes the documentary of Farsad and Obeidallah will be shown from  to  p.m PERIOD in Cade  PERIOD

The  minute documentary casts a spotlight on Islamophobia through a comical lens and consists of commentary from the likes of The Daily Shows Jon Stewart MSNBCs Rachel Maddow CNNs Soledad OBrian and Ali Velshi and comedians such as David Cross Lewis Black Janeane Garofalo and Colin Quinn PERIOD

Farsad and Obeidallahs documentary follows a group of Muslim comedians as they tour throughout the South and the Midwest PERIOD

Laughter always helps diffuse tension explains Ballengee and these two comedians Farsad and Obeidallah use comedy to help stop Islamophobia. following the viewing of their documentary Farsad and Obeidallah will make themselves available in Cade  from  to  p.m PERIOD to open a conversation about Islamophobia with students PERIOD
