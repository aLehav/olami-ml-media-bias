Bikes sit at the bike rack on the Quad PERIOD

By Marissa Plechia Contributing Writer September  

Several years ago Barry Isralewitz sat in his car and witnessedanother car in front of him collide with an unseen bicycle PERIOD Had the bicycle been illuminated the car would have seen the cyclist and the accident could have been prevented PERIOD

Isralewitz is now the cofounder of The Bike Project and a major contributor to theLight the Night project PERIOD

Light the Night an annual event that provides free bike lights will take place from4 to7 p.m PERIOD on Thursday PERIOD There are two locations where volunteers will be stationed the corner of Green and Wright Streets and the corner of Lincoln and Illinois Streets PERIOD This will be the eighth year that the event will take place PERIOD

It was something I had been working for years to prevent Isralewitz said about the collision that sparked Light the Night PERIOD

It is a law in CUthat all bikes must be equipped with front lights and a rear reflector to make it easier for cars and pedestrians to spot bicycles on the street PERIOD Because of this MTD the Facilities and Services department and the communitywill team up to host the event PERIOD



During Light the Night volunteers will be giving out free light sets and help install thegearon participants bikes PERIOD

There is nothing more fun than giving someone a free bike light set said Lily Wilcock active transportation coordinator at the Facilities and Services department PERIOD Im not plugging them or asking them to sign up for my list PERIOD Im not asking them for money PERIOD Im not doing anything except giving them lights. because the Universityis such a large campus transportation is a necessity PERIOD The lights makeit easier for people to get from one place to another safely PERIOD

Mobility is a critically important thing for everybody in our community said Jan Kijowski the marketing manager at MTD.MTDs mission statement is to lead the way for greater mobility  We want to make sure that everybody is able to interact with one another safely and effectively. this event has two main goals PERIOD The first is to bring awareness to the law and make the streets safer for bicyclists PERIOD The second is to create a more sustainable campus and reduce the amount of energy used at the University PERIOD While the event wont be able to completely solve the problem it can at least help PERIOD

When you use a bicycle instead of a car you are actually reducing every day a huge amount of car emissions that you wouldve been emitting otherwise Wilcock said PERIOD

There will be a total of  lights sets each set containing two lights PERIOD And according to Kijowski the lights have run out quickly in the past so she encourages everybody to come as early as possible PERIOD

Weve got over  volunteers for the event PERIOD Now we just need  more people with bikes Wilcock said PERIOD
