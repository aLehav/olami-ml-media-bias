3692,2019-03-24,"based on Rhidian Brooks novel of the same name The Aftermath opens with an aerial view of the bombing of Hamburg a campaign that razed the German city PERIOD Followed by shockinducing shots of the dissipated city in the wake of the air raids the film almost manages to fool the audienceif only for a secondthat The Aftermath will be anything more than a gaudy melodrama PERIOD

Set in Hamburg in 1946five months after the end of World War IIThe Aftermath follows Rachel Morgan Keira Knightley as she is reunited with her husband Lewis Jason Clarke a British officer tasked with rebuilding the ruined city PERIOD But as they settle into their temporary home a sprawling mansion requisitioned by the British government Rachel makes a shocking discovery Her husband has allowed the houses previous tenants the widowed Stephen Lubert Alexander Skarsgrd and his daughter Freda Flora Thiemann to reside in the attic rather than move to the camps PERIOD With Rachel still reeling from the loss of her own son at the hand of a German bombing as well as the distance she feels in her relationship with her husband the charged atmosphere in the house leads to a torrid love affair between Rachel and Lubert PERIOD

Despite outclassing her material Knightley shines as the distraught Rachel Morgan playing the stiffupperlipped Englishwoman with practiced finesse PERIOD Audience members are in for a treat as they watch Knightley evolve on screen PERIOD She tries and fails to mask the grief she feels over her son wringing out her admittedly hollow character for all shes worth PERIOD

Rachels relationship with Lubert cannot be held to such high esteem which forgoes emotional depth in favor of sexual heat PERIOD Their love affair seems inevitable both encompassed in a shared mourning neither can seem to give words to but not for a lack of chemistry Knightley and Skarsgrd offer little beyond aesthetic appeal PERIOD Despite this misfire the cast itself leaves little to be wanting PERIOD Lewis plays a believable albeit emotionally distant husband who shows a more vulnerable side as the film progresses PERIOD Thiemann does a decent enough job as Freda approaching the role with enough bitterness to appear credible PERIOD

While James Kents film is both beautifully shot and begrudgingly wellacted The Aftermath is almost criminal in its underutilization of its polarizing backdrop of postwar Germany PERIOD Despite having ample space to explore the psychological dissonance between the victor and vanquished as well as pose serious questions about guilt and responsibility Kent wastes the movies potential on a shoddy and rushed romance PERIOD The postwar setting is never unpacked beyond being mentioned in brief passing by Lewis work of which the audience is never given a clear picture PERIOD Fredas burgeoning relationship with the Nazi sympathizer shows signs of potential but is ultimately exploited for shock value PERIOD In another scene where Stephens loyalties are questioned we are told that he wasnt a member of the Nazi party and the issue is simply left there PERIOD Coming from Kent director of the  British war film Testament of Youth that was largely successful by comparison this film seems uncharacteristically misguided PERIOD A period piece that tries and fails to be something more The Aftermath is little more than a tepid love affair set against a gauzy backdrop PERIOD Despite all the visual beauty and Alist actors it needed to succeed the film reduces its incredible source material to longing glances and corny melodrama PERIOD
