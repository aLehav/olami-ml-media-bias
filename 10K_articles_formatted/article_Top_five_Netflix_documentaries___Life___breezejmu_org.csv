 PERIOD thirteenth  thirteenth is currently up for an Academy Award for the Best Documentary Feature and has already won  other awards after just being released in October PERIOD Ava DuVernay the director uses the thirteenth Amendment to link slavery and racism in America to the growing rates of incarceration of not only AfricanAmericans but of all people of color PERIOD This documentary was filmed in secrecy and uses statistical and historical data to prove its case PERIOD It addresses the statistic that AfricanAmericans hold the highest percentage of inmates which is disproportional to its overall population PERIOD DuVernay also did an amazing job of gathering interviews with all sorts of people who see this issue from every side PERIOD For those of us who werent around from Kennedy to Nixons presidencies or the establishment of The War on Drugs thirteenth goes into great detail to show how the U.S.s exponential increase in incarceration related to this war and that those who were being incarcerated were mostly people of color PERIOD Its a sensitive issue but thirteenth is a must see for everyone especially with our countrys growing tension between police the judicial system and its citizens PERIOD

 PERIOD The Ivory Game  If you didnt already know African elephants are the largest mammal species to walk this planet PERIOD However over the last  years their population has decreased by  percent PERIOD The Ivory Game follows the lives of these animals as theyre hunted for their tusks all throughout Africa to be traded and sold for billions of dollars in China PERIOD Ivory in China is known as white gold and has been a popular way of displaying ones social status since ancient times PERIOD Directors Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani follow wildlife activists and local police who hunt down elephant poachers PERIOD They also uncover the trade path from Africa to China to see how poachers are smuggling large amounts of ivory into China where only a small fraction of this ivory can be legally sold PERIOD This documentary will pull you right in with its action and its participants passion to end the ivory trade PERIOD

Just recently China announced its permanent ban on the trade of ivory PERIOD This is something the creators of The Ivory Game have been fighting for PERIOD With this result we see that documentaries have an amazing power of bringing a louder voice to issues that may not be on the forefront of minds while also creating a need for change that cant occur without public pressure PERIOD

Netflix has taken advantage of this by producing and distributing documentaries some on controversial topics that might otherwise be shunned by television or other film distributors PERIOD
