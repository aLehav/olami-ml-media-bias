A few passing clouds PERIOD Low 39F PERIOD Winds S at  to  mph PERIOD

Updated November     pm



Only tangentially connected with Marvels Cinematic Universe and entirely missing the titular characters usual adversary SpiderMan initial expectations for Ruben Fleischers Venom were low PERIOD However despite early skepticism and being torn apart by critics the film has managed to carve out a place in audiences hearts PERIOD

If nothing else Venom is a film full of contradictions PERIOD

The feel and general look of the movie  sometimes including the quality of its CGI  look like something from the mid2000s PERIOD However Venom resonates with young audiences and action scenes including a character who is a fluid shapeshifter are nothing if not visually interesting PERIOD

At times it has some terribly corny dialogue such as the much lambasted turd in the wind line from the cinematic trailer PERIOD And yet somehow it manages to come off as more earnest than most films PERIOD

It is not a film trying to champion a deep message PERIOD It is not a film trying to revolutionize the industry like Black Panther Crazy Rich Asians or Love Simon. it is not a film that tells the story of a grand battle for the fate of the universe such as Marvels Infinity War. it does not have the terror necessary to succeed as a horror movie but it is also too dark to truly succeed as a comedy or traditional superhero action movie PERIOD It is by no means a piece of art nor will it win any awards for its writing PERIOD And yet Venom succeeds at being truly entertaining PERIOD And is that not at the core what we ask of a piece of entertainment While most critics have destroyed the film earning only a  percent rating on RottenTomatoes audiences have praised it and its audience score rests at  percent or Certified Fresh. the secret to this success is that despite being a film about a scruffy exreporter being overtaken by a symbiotic alien goomonster it is a likable movie largely populated by likeable characters PERIOD And going along with the theme of symbiosis Venom puts relationships at the center of its story PERIOD

Our protagonist Eddie Brock played by action movie veteran Tom Hardy is a reporter who loses his job for attempting a takedown piece on charismatic yet immoral billionaire scientist Carlton Drake Riz Ahmed who initially brings the alien Venom symbiote to earth for experimentation PERIOD

The relationship and banter between Brock and Venom produces some of the best comedy of the film and is where the film really shines PERIOD Venoms slow morph from a source of terror in Eddie to a source of exasperation is outdone in enjoyability only by the surprisingly touching transformation of Venom himself PERIOD The character moves from a mysterious carnivorous monster into a slightly unsettling but wellmeaning buddy to Eddie PERIOD Despite Venom surviving Venoms willingness to lay down his life for Brock in the finale is surprisingly very touching PERIOD

The ultimate deal the two strike  yes you can eat people but only bad people  is a far cry from the righteous justice of Captain America but it is fitting to the relationship that Venom and Brock create PERIOD

The character Anne Michelle Williams never falls prey to the misogynistic trope of the mean crazy exgirlfriend and her decision to break up with Brock after learning that he broke into her computer for confidential files to use as a source in his story is framed as being completely justified PERIOD

Eddie is forced to confront and apologize for the fact that it was his actions not Drakes evil that ruined their relationship and that Anne was justified in distancing herself from him PERIOD

Venom is by no means a perfect film nor is it a particularly deep film but is an incredibly fun ride populated by enjoyable characters and appealing action PERIOD
