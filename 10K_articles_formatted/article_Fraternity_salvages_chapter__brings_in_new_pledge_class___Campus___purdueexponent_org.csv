Mostly clear PERIOD Low near 35F PERIOD Winds light and variable PERIOD

Updated November     pm



After restructuring their charter one Purdue fraternity has returned to campus ready to make a difference in the Greek community PERIOD

In July  Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity was down to  brothers living in their house when their national chapter had to decide whether or not to further pursue their chapter at Purdue PERIOD

Grand chapter adviser Josh Russell said that the chapters decline was a product of poor alumni connections and inconsistent leadership on the chapters part.While that started to change the last few years it proved to be too late PERIOD The only option was a fresh start all around and new leadership including the Chapter Advisory Council and Housing Corporation PERIOD This was a tough joint decision made between myself our national headquarters and housing corporation said Russell PERIOD

The decision came down to making all current members alumni and bringing in a new pledge class to recolonize PERIOD Their efforts were successful and in the fall of  Alpha Sigma Phi had  new members consisting of mostly freshmen and sophomores PERIOD

We were able to recruit an incredible group of men that understand the vision of our fraternity and are hungry to learn how to be a successful chapter said Russell PERIOD The big difference between them and the previous group is their understanding and commitment to the values of our fraternity. the national fraternity members came to Purdue and recruited fitting members and named sophomore in chemical engineering Philip Pielet the new president PERIOD

Its really tough because everything you do is starting from scratch said Pielet PERIOD You have nothing to go off of from the past. none of the new members live in the fraternity house and wont do so until this fall where they will be a part of normal fall fraternity recruitment with a goal of  to  new members PERIOD

Pielet said there are plenty of leadership opportunities within the fraternity and that you learn teamwork skills similar to those of a workplace PERIOD

Its really rewarding when you put the time and effort into it said Pielet PERIOD I became president for the unique opportunity to make a mark on campus .. PERIOD and start a fraternity. the house consists of a lot of engineering and Honors College students but is not geared toward one major specifically PERIOD

Alpha Sigma Phi is in the process of pairing with Purdues Center for Cancer Research to put on a run in April to raise  for research PERIOD The decision to partner with the Center for Cancer Research was to honor an Alpha Sigma Phi brother who had to leave Purdue for cancer treatment PERIOD

Currently the fraternity is internally dealing with recolonizing but hopes to participate in events and make a name for itself on campus PERIOD

My goal is to lay a foundation where I can come back in  years and see the fraternity thriving and know I was part of that said Pielet PERIOD

After bringing in a new pledge class and reestablishing their reputation on campus Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity has begun updates to their house PERIOD
