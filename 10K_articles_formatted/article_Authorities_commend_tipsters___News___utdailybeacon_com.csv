Andrea Sharp her boyfriend Jason Roden and their friends Al and Lizabeth Joy were returning from a trip to Florida when they spotted Jones Ford Explorer near the TennesseeGeorgia state line and called  PERIOD

That  call led to Jones capture and the safe recovery of the three children with him PERIOD

If that citizen hadnt called we might still be looking for him said Trooper Jason Davis of the Georgia State Patrol PERIOD

Roden of Rising Fawn Ga. told the Chattanooga Times Free Press the group was on its way home from Panama City Fla. when a wrong turn routed them through Atlanta rather than toward Birmingham Ala PERIOD

After passing the Calhoun exit on Interstate  Roden said they passed a vehicle that fit the description of Jones Ford Explorer PERIOD

From her front passenger seat Sharp of Lookout Mountain Ga. said she made eye contact with the Explorers driver as they passed PERIOD

I looked up at him and he looked down at me Sharp said PERIOD It looked like he was slapping at something behind the seat PERIOD

Roden then slowed to drive behind the Explorer and Sharp handed her cell phone to the Joys of Cleveland Tenn. who were sitting in the back seat PERIOD

Al Joy called  and asked for the license plate numbers on Jones car PERIOD

It was amazing when the dispatchers matched those license plate numbers Joy said PERIOD

Joy said it was less than  minutes before police took up positions behind Jones but he says it seemed like forever PERIOD

The four friends said they were glad they were able to help PERIOD

There was a reason for that wrong turn Sharp said PERIOD

Sharp said she received a call Friday from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation with an invitation to meet Perdue Monday PERIOD

They said he wanted to thank all the people involved in this Sharp said PERIOD
