Corey Smith

Singer finds niche outside of Southeast community with progressive country sound

Its been a long time since Corey Smith spent his days playing openmic nights in a bar in Athens Ga PERIOD

The Georgia native first started sharing his music with the world around his college years and some might say hes never left those years behind PERIOD

Smiths music selfdescribed as progressive country has been a staple of the college music scene in the South for several years now with no signs of being held up PERIOD

I like to think that Im not as traditional as a lot of country artists Smith said PERIOD I hope that Im expressing what its like to come from the rural South and at the same time challenging authority. when the young musician was first starting out he limited songwriting to what he knew best PERIOD Namely those things were college alcohol and the state of Georgia PERIOD

With song titles like Drinkin Again and F the PoPo Smith was quick to find friends all over the Southeast PERIOD Lately however the songwriter felt the need to write music with a deeper meaning PERIOD

With earlier songs the meaning is right there on the surface Smith said PERIOD It may take longer for people to appreciate a deeper style of writing but I dont regret it. smiths latest album Keeping Up with the Joneses features a lot of his new writing style and his fans seem to be enjoying it PERIOD The album debuted at No PERIOD  on iTunes singersongwriter chart in November  PERIOD

The musicians popularity in the South is a given because of his birthplace but recently he has been taking his music to places farther past the MasonDixon Line PERIOD

In my first shows in those regions New England and the Midwest Ive had  people come out in some cases Smith said PERIOD It took a long time to get  people to come out in Athens or in Chattanooga. the artist is presently working on a new album recorded in Athens at The Rialto Room PERIOD Although much of the music has been recorded its currently sitting in limbo until Smith decides what to do with the recordings PERIOD

Right now Im not in a hurry to get anything out because Keeping Up with the Joneses hasnt even been out a year Smith said PERIOD Im in the process still of wading through it all and figuring out how to put it together in a powerful way. as a father of two the musician knows that one day his kids will find out how their father made his living PERIOD Its safe to say that Smith is not looking forward to the conversation PERIOD

I can hear my kids singing along with me sometimes and its kind of weird Smith said PERIOD Theyre going to learn what all of this stuff means some day and Im going to have to sit down with them. although the artist may enjoy his success today he believes it is important to never forget why he does what he does PERIOD

My goal essentially has been to try and reach as many people as possible without sacrificing the integrity of my work Smith said PERIOD

Corey Smith will play at the Valarium on Oct PERIOD  PERIOD
