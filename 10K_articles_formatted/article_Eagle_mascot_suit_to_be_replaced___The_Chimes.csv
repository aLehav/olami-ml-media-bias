Alethia Selby WriterOctober  

Biolas current Eagle mascot suit will be retired at the beginning of November and a new custom suit will replace it PERIOD

The old suit has seen better days according to Brianna Stewart Spirit Board chair PERIOD  Although the current suit was purchased four years ago the old suit as Stewart said is cheap and was not expected to last long PERIOD Jeff Hoffman sports information director said the design and make of the current suit is generally not expected to last more than a single sporting season PERIOD

Suits like that are not meant to last very long Stewart agreed PERIOD

With a collaboration of the athletics department AS and Integrated Marketing Communications IMC Biola purchased a custommade mascot suit for  to replace the current suit that is quickly deteriorating PERIOD

The current suit is no longer in the proper condition to continue to be used as often as needed PERIOD The fan within the suit designed to keep its occupants cool while they entertain the crowd is no longer working the colors of the suit itself are dingy and it has an incurable stench according to Stewart PERIOD

I feel like its important to get a new mascot suit because the one we have is not up to par Stewart said PERIOD

Biola hopes to reach out more toward the community  one way to do that is have a presentable mascot PERIOD

Hoffman said the decision was made to purchase a more expensive suit so that it would last longer PERIOD Both Hoffman and Stewart expressed their disapproval of the current suits generic style PERIOD The new suit will be unique to Biola PERIOD

The new suit was custom designed based off the Eagle created for the sports department by Ben Orr a Biola alum PERIOD It will be a buffed up fighting Eagle complete with a sports jersey and muscle suit PERIOD

The suit will be made of a special plastic material instead of fabric making the care and cleaning of it much easier than the current one PERIOD The new suit will be kept in a clear case in the athletics department to ensure that it is kept in a good condition PERIOD

According to Hoffman the suit could last five to fifteen years if it is properly cared for making the  justifiable to those who contributed to the purchase PERIOD

The Athletics department contributed about  percent to the price of the suit PERIOD AS recognized the need for a new mascot suit and noted purchasing one could benefit Biola not only this year but also in the years to come and gave about  percent and  PERIOD IMC gave about  percent PERIOD

Biola will not only have a new suit to enhance its image but also a qualified mascot to wear it PERIOD Michael More a highly qualified mascot contacted Stewart last year with hopes of becoming Biolas mascot PERIOD He has won awards been through camps and is considered to be close to professional according to Hoffman PERIOD

The sports department is also looking to name the new eagle and will be soliciting names for students to vote on soon PERIOD

The named eagle will be unveiled at Midnight Madness Nov PERIOD  PERIOD

Im really excited to have something more professional Hoffman said PERIOD It takes us out of the quasihigh school look and brings us into more of a prototypical college atmosphere. news
