People from Arkansas can hold their own with the best of Hollywood PERIOD

Thats what Dr PERIOD Gregory Urwin a military historian and professor and his  recruits set out to prove when they traveled to Jekyll Island Georgia to help film the Civil War epic Glory which Urwin was an extra in PERIOD

Thank you for letting me tell you about a brief flirtation with Hollywood Urwin said after being introduced on Feb PERIOD  PERIOD

Urwin spoke for an hour about the recruiting and filming process at a program entitled An Evening of Glory. the event was presented by the Rider University Veterans Association in conjunction with the Leadership Development Program and the Black Student Union PERIOD

Glory tells the story of the fifty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry the first African American regiment in the Civil War led by the young Col PERIOD Robert Gould Shaw Matthew Broderick PERIOD

Urwin gave a behindthescenes look at the making of the film PERIOD He first heard about the project as an associate professor at the University of Central Arkansas PERIOD

The producer Freddy Fields had a hard time selling the idea of a black Civil War film Urwin said PERIOD They were given a budget of  million which is low for this sort of film PERIOD So Fields decided to rely on reenactors for the fights to stay within the budget and still keep the accuracy. associate producer Ray Herbeck was key in this sense Urwin explained because of his connections to reenactors PERIOD Urwin decided he wanted to get in on the action PERIOD

I called up Ray Herbeck and offered my services he said PERIOD I would be in the picture if I could recruit a company of black soldiers. urwin set to it recruiting students and friends alike and teaching them the proper marching techniques PERIOD

I really liked the idea of making a movie where black and white come together Urwin said PERIOD Recruiting students to help make the movie would also give the university good publicity. he admitted he also had less noble motives for wanting to be in the film PERIOD

Like most Americans I have a fascination with the film industry Urwin said PERIOD I also wanted to go on an ego trip. urwin faced challenges with equipping his company and eventually only  of his  recruits made it to Jekyll Island for the filming PERIOD

My biggest regret is that I couldnt raise enough money to outfit all of them he said PERIOD

One of Urwins favorite memories occurred just before he and his company left for filming PERIOD Outfitted in Union uniforms the company drilled for the university PERIOD

It was not the typical way that the Civil War had been commemorated at most southern universities and I was proud of that Urwin said PERIOD

When Urwin and the recruits got to the set he noticed that his group had a few advantages PERIOD

Most of the recruits were older reenactors he said PERIOD I had a bunch of fit young college students so it was more believable. it also turned out that the UCA contingent was one of the larger groups on set PERIOD

Only two other welltrained groups were bigger than mine Urwin said PERIOD

Urwin ended up with extras in his company as he was put in charge of a group of minor offenders from Arizona who were working on the movie as a form of community service PERIOD

I wasnt thrilled about it at first but I managed to whip my enlarged company into shape he said PERIOD

The producers had wanted  recruits but only managed to obtain  PERIOD The producers managed to hire  more from urban areas in Georgia PERIOD

Lots of these recruits were street people said Urwin PERIOD It gave my students who were from rural areas mostly their first experience with the urban underclass. at one point during filming some of these street people caused an incident at one of the trucks designated to bring water to the actors PERIOD Soon the trucks stopped coming PERIOD

Eventually the white men leading the reenactors had to talk to the producers as they felt the black reenactors were receiving unfair treatment PERIOD

This gave me my first taste of being black in America Urwin said PERIOD

Urwin said that other racial tensions flared up on set at times PERIOD The black men who were new at reenacting often grew frustrated with the happy hyper white guys leading the companies PERIOD

Urwin had many interesting experiences on set PERIOD He met Allan R PERIOD Millett from Ohio State University when he offered to help teach him to march PERIOD

Urwin became friends with Americas top military historian. millett a former military man proved to be a great help in easing any tensions within the company PERIOD

For me this reinforced the difference between real military officers and pretend officers like me Urwin said PERIOD

He related stories about the cast which included such esteemed names as Morgan Freeman Denzel Washington and Broderick PERIOD

While Broderick got the star billing it was clear that the actors with the most talent on the set were Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington Urwin said PERIOD

Freeman did a good job of keeping the recruits in line said Urwin and Washington was always a consummate professional though he rarely strayed from his trailer when not on camera PERIOD

Perhaps the most interesting story Urwin told involved one of his company one of the Arizona guys and a volatile young actor named Jihmi Kennedy PERIOD

Urwin spoke about a scene where the regiment is marching toward Fort Wagner in South Carolina PERIOD Since Brodericks horse kept startling because of the cheers the men received in the scene they had to do numerous takes PERIOD

The extras were irritated Urwin said PERIOD It was a hot day PERIOD One of the guys from Arizona just freaked out. the man started shouting curses and stripped down to his underwear PERIOD He then took off in the direction of the ocean PERIOD

I figured Id just let him do his thing PERIOD He would take a dip cool off and come back Urwin said PERIOD

Instead of running into the ocean the man turned a corner and disappeared down the beach PERIOD

Later the man came back got dressed and started walking to the meal tent after the others had been bussed over PERIOD Along the way he spotted a beautiful woman who was often on the set and Kennedy PERIOD He decided to ask the woman for a date PERIOD

When she refused he persisted PERIOD Jihmi got involved and soon there was an altercation PERIOD

I think Jihmi learned that when an actor picks a fight with a real street punk and theres no director or script the street punk wins Urwin said PERIOD

Everything worked out in the end and Morgan Freeman even shook the Arizona mans hand PERIOD

Urwin enjoyed the film immensely and believes it helped him grow in his profession PERIOD

Working on Glory was exciting and inspiring he said PERIOD It was more than just a movie to me.",Behind the scenes of war epic â€“ The Rider News,Rider University
