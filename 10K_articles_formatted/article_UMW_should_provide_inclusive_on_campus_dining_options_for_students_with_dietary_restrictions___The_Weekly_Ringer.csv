The Simple Servings station in the dining hall provides allergyfriendly and glutenfree dining options for students PERIOD                                                                                    Abbey Magnet  The Weekly Ringer

As someone who has a Jewish heritage and intermittently follows a kosher diet Ive learned that kosher dining on campus is next to impossible PERIOD While UMW does offer some kosher meals around Passover or during cultural celebrations on a daytoday basis there are no options available to students who are practicing a kosher diet PERIOD To ensure that all studentsno matter their diethave access to food they can eat on campus and feel valued as a part of the campus community there needs to be a wider and more inclusive variety of food available PERIOD

According to Rose Benedict Sodexos unit marketing coordinator UMW currently does not have the means to prepare kosher foods PERIOD

As you may know the only way that a dining program can offer Kosher foods is to have a separate kitchen dedicated to preparing Kosher meals Benedict in an email to The Weekly Ringer PERIOD There is not space in the CRUC to establish a separate Kosher kitchen and we dont have any other locations on campus where we could do that. this means that theres no feasible way for me to practice any kind of kosher diet at school as there are no guaranteed kosher dining options on campus PERIOD As someone who follows the diet intermittently I only experience issues at certain times of the year around high holidays PERIOD If I were to practice kosher on a daily basis though it would be an impractical and unachievable feat PERIOD

There are a few items labeled as kosher at the Simply To Go Market in the Eagles Nest PERIOD However theres no guarantee that there hasnt been any crosscontamination which would make them truly kosher PERIOD Theres not sufficient separation between kosher and nonkosher food items at Simply To Go and separation is super important to people who follow a kosher diet PERIOD

At my home we have two separate fridges to store meat and dairy PERIOD In most orthodox households youll find two completely separate areas to prepare meat and dairy dishes and some people will even have separate silverware and plates to serve them on PERIOD Therefore having kosher and nonkosher foods together at Simply To Go isnt ideal PERIOD

Although theUniversitys Diversity and Inclusionpage states that UMW is committed to creating a community that is diverse inclusive and affirming to all individuals and The Office of Diversity and Inclusion will work to ensure an academically and socially engaged environment where all faculty staff and students feel supported the lack of inclusive dining options starkly contrasts that mission PERIOD

The limited dining options on campus have a direct impact on students lives and can prevent them from having a positive experience at UMW PERIOD As Mary Washingtons student body represents a variety of lifestyles and backgrounds and the University promotes and embraces diversity and inclusion Mary Washington should have inclusive dining options providing an array of hot and cold meals for those who adhere to specific diets PERIOD This pertains not only to kosher diets but also to vegetarian vegan and halal ones as well PERIOD

According to Benedict UMW Dining aims to work with students to accommodate their diets which is part of the reason why Meg Paulson a sophomore womens gender and sexuality studies and English double major who also has Celiac disease chose to attend UMW experienced after there was a change in the dining staff PERIOD

The reason I picked Mary Washington was that I was told they could accommodate me I took a private tour of the kitchen and worked with the executive chef at the time who is no longer the executive chef and left as soon as I arrived for my first year Paulson said PERIOD

Paulson cant eat at Panera or Vocellis because of the bread and flour they said and eating at other places on campus is a risk because of crosscontamination PERIOD Paulson said that UMW tried to cater to her dietary restrictions but they ended up getting sick anyway PERIOD

They tried to accommodate my dietary needs last year encouraging me to only eat at Simple Servings but I constantly got sick due to crosscontamination Paulson said PERIOD Its very easy for that to happen because of the fact that theres communal silverwareif someone touches a fork and puts it back or its not cleaned properly Ill be sick for days if its minimal cross contamination but serious cases lead me to be sick for weeks. paulson continued It made my first year at UMW miserable because I was so sick and not to mention that because its an autoimmune disease so my immune system is weakened when I am getting glutenedI was sick for months with stuffy noses coughs and more all year. this year Paulson got a meal plan exemption and they eat microwaveable meals in their dorm room PERIOD

I am glad that ODR gave me a meal plan exemption because having a meal plan and not being able to use it is a waste of money they said PERIOD

UMW Dining tries to take into consideration the varied lifestyles and diets within the student body PERIOD

Concerning vegan options the Grown station at the Earth Bar offers a hot vegan meal for lunch and dinner every day and we are constantly expanding the variety of options available said Benedict PERIOD The Simple Servings station is our allergyfriendly point of service PERIOD Complete meals free of wheat gluten eggs milk shellfish nuts tree nuts sesame and soy are available there PERIOD Those food items are stored cooked and prepared in separate areas with dedicated equipment by specially trained staff to ensure there is no crosscontamination. however for students who practice alternative diets the one Simple Servings station in the dining hall isnt enough and its sometimes not an option for people with severe allergies like Paulson PERIOD

In my experience the dining hall does not provide a wide enough variety of food for people practicing a kosher diet in particular PERIOD The Earth Bar frequently has a makeyourown salad bar and pasta or potato salads as well as the occasional soup but thats about it PERIOD Theres also one vegan option on the other side of the station but its not the best PERIOD All this to say it gets repetitive after a while when this station is your only oncampus option and I find myself going to McDonalds or other offcampus retailers often PERIOD The McDonalds near campus has some kosher items on certain days though not every McDonalds does PERIOD

Other than the Earth Bar the Simply to Go market in Woodard Hall is the best dining establishment to go to for students with dining restrictions but that is not to say much PERIOD

So while there are a handful of dietfriendly options on campus they arent as inclusive as they need to be to serve UMWs diverse student population and some of these options are only offered during certain times of the year such as kosher options during UMWs Jewish Cultural Dinner in November and during Passover PERIOD

The matter of crosscontamination and the lack of trust in the universitys dining options create a scarcity of dining options on campus PERIOD Because of this the University needs to provide more inclusive dining options for those who follow alternative diets on campus due to health lifestyle or religious beliefs PERIOD",UMW should provide inclusive on-campus dining options for students with dietary restrictions â€“ The Weekly Ringer,University of Mary Washington
