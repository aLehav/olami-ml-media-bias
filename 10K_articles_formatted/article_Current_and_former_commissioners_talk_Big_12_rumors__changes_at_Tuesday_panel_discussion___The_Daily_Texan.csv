5975,2023-07-11,"big  commissioner Bob Bowlsby and former commissioner Dan Beebe addressed the state of the conference in a panel moderated by UT advertising lecturer Joel Lulla PERIOD

Much like a closely followed celebrity the Big  Conference basks in the sunlight of collegiate sports marked by rumors of expansion and new additions PERIOD

Big  Commissioner Bob Bowlsby former Commissioner Dan Beebe and Deputy Commissioner Tim Weiser addressed conference realignment NCAA postseason changes and the future of the Big  at a panel Tuesday PERIOD

Bowlsby who was named fulltime commissioner in May  was riding a golf cart to and from work as athletic director at Stanford University when he was offered the commissioner position PERIOD Taking the reins of a conference in the midst of realignments that included losses of Colorado Missouri Nebraska and Texas AM and the addition of TCU and West Virginia was his challenge PERIOD

Bowlsby said the conference will tend to geographic challenges in the upcoming season by strategically scheduling games to accommodate teams that may have to travel further PERIOD

Geography still matters and one of the things thats gone by the wayside during the course of this expansion is a lot of the traditional rivalries Bowlsby said PERIOD You can imagine how people would feel if we went to  teams if it meant Texas and OU wouldnt play each other one year. expanding the conference to potentially include  teams is not something the Big  despite its name is currently focused on Bowlsby said PERIOD

There are a lot of strengths in smaller numbers and were going to be thoughtful about it Bowlsby said PERIOD Were ten for a considerable decision to stay at ten and I expect that until were persuaded otherwise thats where well stay. weiser who took on his current role after seven years as athletics director at Kansas State University said missed classes for student athletes and tough travel times are issues that continue to be smoothed out PERIOD

With TCU integration has been fairly predictable and fairly smooth Weiser said PERIOD With West Virginia Im not sure weve gotten to a place that weve successfully answered those challenges. beebe who served as commissioner from  to  and departed as the conference sought to stabilize itself during realignments said the connection between students and alumni is a consideration for teams as they decide to stay or switch conferences PERIOD

I think when you detach institutions from the place where they primarily get their students and where their alumni go to live and work its never a comfortable situation Beebe said PERIOD

The panel also discussed the addition of a fourteam playoff in the postseason of college football which was approved in June  and will start in  PERIOD

Weve been able to embrace the best characteristics of the bowl system and I think the fourteam playoff with a selection committee is the right way to do that Bowlsby said PERIOD We still have some things to work out but I think this playoff format has a chance to be a great thing for the players and the institution. official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin","Current and former commissioners talk Big 12 rumors, changes at Tuesday panel discussion â€“ The Daily Texan",University of Texas Austin
