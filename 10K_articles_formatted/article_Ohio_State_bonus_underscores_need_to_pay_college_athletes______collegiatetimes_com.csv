Humanities Week returned from Oct PERIOD  to  with free online and inperson events around Virginia Techs campus PERIOD

Virginia Tech mens soccer fell to No PERIOD  North Carolina Wednesday night in the first round of the ACC tournament  a loss that puts the nail in the coffin on the Hokies season PERIOD

While most of spooky seasons special events have come to pass fall is far from over with plenty of fun festivities still in store for Hokies hoping to embrace all the season has to offer PERIOD Southwest Virginia hosts events and has natural beauty for students to enjoy with family friends or 

An open letter to President Sands

Search salaries of employees from Virginia Tech and other universities dating back to  PERIOD

The idea of amateurism in collegiate sports has always been a dubious one but never has the proposition seemed more tenuous than in  PERIOD

Not only are we in the midst of March Madness an event that will rake in hundreds of millions of dollars for CBS and the Turner networks that broadcast it but even a sport as innocuous as college wrestling has started to belie the broken nature of the college system PERIOD

After Ohio States Logan Steiber won the  pound weight class in the NCAA tournament last weekend the schools athletic directorGene Smithreceived a bonus equal to one week of his salary PERIOD

That means Smith will receive a little over  for an achievement that he had precious little to do with PERIOD

Bonuses like these are omnipresent throughout college athletics and few features of the NCAAs patently unfair system make it clearerwhy colleges should be paying these athletes PERIOD

Clearly the money for these athletes is floating around but it would just require a few pay cuts from those that at the very top of the system PERIOD

While athletic directors undoubtedly deserve incentives in their contracts for producing an environment conducive to team success  Techs own Whit Babcock has bonuses tied to the football basketball and Olympics sports teams of escalating worth  but making them connected to an individuals performance without rewarding the athlete that achieved them only highlights the NCAAs hypocrisy PERIOD

Yet public sentiment towardfairly compensating college athletes still remains mixed PERIOD

A recent poll conducted by The Washington Post and ABC News found that just  percent of those surveyed either strongly or somewhat supported paying college athletes while  percent were either strongly or somewhat opposed to it PERIOD

Those who deny that these athletes deserve compensation are deliberately ignoring the facts PERIOD

Paying athletes wont bankrupt schools  a study by University of San Francisco sports management professor Daniel Rascher proved as much pointing out that the salaries of coaches and athletics directors tend to become so wildly inflated because theres no labor force to pay and an adjustment could help even out this inequity PERIOD

And when you examine the staggeringly low graduation rates of students forced to balance a demanding practice schedule with academics the value of the education these schools provide diminishes as well PERIOD

Its just downright impossible to claim that college athletes dont deserve to be paid and if Smiths bonus doesnt sway public opinion its hard to tell what will PERIOD
