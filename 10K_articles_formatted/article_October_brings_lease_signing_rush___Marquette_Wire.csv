Its that time of year again PERIOD

According to students and landlords alike October heralds the beginning of leasesigning season with a deluge of students applying for offcampus housing PERIOD But why the rush

Each year  students fill capacity in the dorms according to the Office of Residence Lifes Web site PERIOD This leaves more than  students looking to find offcampus housing after their sophomore year according to Stacie Dooley associate dean of Residence Life for University Apartments and OffCampus Student Services PERIOD

Juanita Werra landlord at Strack Apartments attributes the leasesigning rush mainly to scarcity PERIOD She also cited the construction of university apartments specifically the addition of Campus Town in  as another reason PERIOD

When Campus Town was built they had a sleepover there to encourage people to sign leases in October Werra said PERIOD That year offcampus housing lost a lot of students and had a lot of vacancies PERIOD After that the landlords started renting earlier. but at the time Campus Town was not universityowned PERIOD The university acquired the apartments in  nearly five years after the October leasesigning trend began Dooley said PERIOD

Though the Campus Town apartments may have begun the October signing ritual Dooley said some students have perpetuated it PERIOD

Students worried about the early timeline felt like it was from their peers Dooley said PERIOD They hear about someone signing a lease and then they become anxious PERIOD They are aware that sophomores are looking for housing and without any information they start looking for housing too. to stem the spread of the early leasesigning plague University Apartments and OffCampus Student Services used to hold informational offcampus housing sessions for freshmen during movein weekend PERIOD However this may have had an adverse effect PERIOD

Students said university apartments created more anxiety while they gave information about apartments Dooley said PERIOD So instead we now send out a slow down email. the email tries to debunk myths about offcampus housing PERIOD It stresses for example that there really isnt a scarcity problem Dooley said PERIOD

She said students dont have to worry about not finding housing since each year there are more living options PERIOD

Since the offcampus housing rush began over  years ago the number of apartment buildings in the campus area has nearly doubled from  to over  according to Dooley PERIOD The number of houses have tripled from  to nearly  PERIOD

There were  apartment buildings and  houses in the neighborhood when the offcampus housing rush began over  years ago according to Dooley PERIOD This year there are over  apartment buildings and nearly  houses PERIOD

There is plenty of housing for everyone Dooley said PERIOD

Eight new locations were added to the Marquette Tenant Guide this year  generally around the amount added annually she said PERIOD

Dooley said shes working to discontinue early signing PERIOD

Signing a lease too early can complicate your ability to take advantage of academic opportunities that may take you away from the Marquette campus during your junior year such as study abroad opportunities coop positions and internships Dooley said PERIOD Plus you may not even be friends with the same people by the end of your sophomore year PERIOD Its sad but it happens. some students agree that the rush to sign early in the fall is unreasonable such as Cathy Randle a sophomore in the College of Education PERIOD

When theres pressure to sign a lease that early it is really hard to look at all the places you might want to stay and make a quick decision Randle said PERIOD Were busy students and some property managers dont offer tours until October PERIOD A few weeks is not enough time to make a choice. due to the construction of the new Discovery Learning Complex which starts in spring  students like Josh Buege a senior in the College of Arts  Sciences have speculated there will be an increased demand for offcampus housing starting this year PERIOD

Carmel Hall Trebor Apartments and Kalt Apartments will be demolished to make way for the fivestory  squarefoot complex on the south side of Wisconsin Avenue between sixteenth and seventeenth streets

Offcampus university housing options will be narrowed by  spaces PERIOD

But Dooley doesnt believe this will make it more difficult for students to find offcampus housing PERIOD

There has been enough development in the neighborhood that it wont make much of a difference Dooley said PERIOD Theyre all pretty small buildings PERIOD Its more their style of housing that students are looking for that will be affected since theyre all studios or twobedrooms. the student news site of Marquette University
