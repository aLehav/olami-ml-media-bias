2775,2013-09-27,"one day after Gov PERIOD Scott Walker proposed eight bills designed to stimulate economic growth Wisconsin was ranked 34thin the nation in private sector job creation according to a federal report released Thursday PERIOD

Walker said in a statement he was proud of Wisconsins growth but the work to continue growth is not finished PERIOD

The report from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages under the Federal Bureau and Labor Statistics ranked each state and county in terms of wages weekly and yearly growth and private sector jobs PERIOD

According to Walkers statement the report ranks Wisconsin twenty-second in the nation in private sector job growth while other legislators statements said Wisconsin is ranked thirty-fourth PERIOD

According to the report Wisconsin is 22ndin the nation in actual jobs numbers with more than  private sector jobs created between March  and March  but 34thin the nation in the percentage change of private sector jobs growth at . percent PERIOD

Sen PERIOD Tom Tiffany RHazelhurst chair of the Committee on Workforce Development said he agreed with Walkers choice to use actual job numbers rather than percentage of growth since it shows how many people are actually employed PERIOD Tiffany added he was pleased with Walkers renewed focus on job creation PERIOD

Rep PERIOD Andy Jorgensen DFt PERIOD Atkinson member of the Committee on Small Business Development said Walker is spinning the numbers for his advantage PERIOD

As Harry Truman said If you cant convince someone youve got to confuse them Jorgensen said PERIOD He doesnt like the numbers everyone else is going by. jorgensen said he feels the job bills Walker proposed Wednesday are underwhelming. according to Walkers statement from Wednesday the proposed bills include additional funding to technical colleges and K12 education services for individuals with special needs extra incentives for high school students in apprenticeship programs among other programs PERIOD

Sen PERIOD Fred Risser DMadison said Walkers bills and economic growth plans do not develop the middle class because they only benefit the rich PERIOD

In his committee Jorgensen said he worked alongside committee chair Rep PERIOD Jeff Stone RGreendale to address the concerns of middleclass smalltown manufacturers rather than outside interests PERIOD

The manufacturing industry in Wisconsin is seeing job growth and is a great place for familyoriented middleclass jobs Tiffany said PERIOD

Employers both large and small in Minnesota and Illinois have higher taxes and greater regulations so job creators are looking at Wisconsin as a good alternative Tiffany said PERIOD

Tiffany said residents are looking at the direction the state is headed not necessarily job numbers and reports PERIOD

Jorgensen added while job reports help to give a measure of Wisconsins job creation progress they cannot always be relied on for true information PERIOD

We can have all the reports we want but keep in mind the best judge of whether we are doing well is just talking with your friends and neighbors and theyre hurting Jorgensen said PERIOD Thats the report I go by. walkers office did not return calls PERIOD
