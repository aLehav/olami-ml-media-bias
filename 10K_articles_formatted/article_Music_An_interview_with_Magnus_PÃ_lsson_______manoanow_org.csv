Magnus Palsson  Magnus Palsson has been writing chiptunesstyled
songs for games since  PERIOD

The chiptune scene has only been around formally for five years
when it became known thanks to the formation of the Website label
and collective  bit peoples PERIOD However dont tell that to Magnus
Plsson who has been making music on computers since  and has
commisioned his music to many indie developers most recently on
 by Charlies games PERIOD

Over email Plsson answered some questions about the scene and
his history as we discover his love of beds his first synth band
what  and why he hates
Timbaland PERIOD

Q About how long would you consider yourself part of
the scene

A My first glimpse was in  PERIOD I had a friend
who had a newly purchased stateoftheart Amiga computer PERIOD
Soundtracker came with a copy of a computer magazine and I made my
first tune on his computer PERIOD It was my first encounter with such a
powerful musical program and I was amazed as to how easy it was to
use PERIOD After  hours I had made a masterpiece PERIOD A song so fresh so
cool so new and astonishing that there was simply no way I
couldnt get absurdly rich if I sold it PERIOD But we didnt have any
floppy diskspace to save it on so we just had to turn it off and
lose my first chance of fame and forture PERIOD I can still wake up
screaming having broken a cold sweat with my mind racing in
anxiety about it PERIOD Also I lost my second masterpiece that I made a
couple of years later to a virus but thats .. PERIOD just too painful
to talk about PERIOD But a couple of years later with the advent to the
modems I started using BBSs and attending copyparties where I
could get more songs to play with is when I entered the
community PERIOD

Q Could you explain the feeling when you were first
commissioned

A One of the finest feelings PERIOD I had worked out
a custom tune for a game that was running on a competition PERIOD If it
earned a high ranking Id get paid PERIOD It did PERIOD The best thing was
that I could share the happiness with the other developers and we
rejoiced as the game gained popularity on the net since removed PERIOD
Theres something special with a team effort where everyone puts
in their best and share the rewards PERIOD Of course the money was all
used up at a local pub to celebrate I was truly an artist now PERIOD

Q Where do you see the indie game scene in five
years

A With the advent of everincreasing
netspeeds and powerful javaflashsilverlight applications I can
imagine games that are played from a web browser but being
fullscreen anyway with graphics rivaling normal games PERIOD Genrewise
there are few new hits that break mold like Tetris did but I think
therell be better versions of all the themes games have today PERIOD

Q Do you think it will rival the mainstream game
developers or do you see more up and coming developers going to
indies over big marque games

A Indie games will always have their place
mostly because of the freedom they have to create exactly what they
want without censorship PERIOD For example I recently made the music for
a freeware sidescrolling space shootemup PERIOD I didnt look into the
game beforehand I just had a finished song for it when the dev
asked me for permission to use it PERIOD

When he sent the game to me I was a bit suprised the spaceship
was a severed dogs head and the mission was to shoot down
different forms of male genetalia that try to ejaculate on you PERIOD

So yeah theres so many unique indie devs since it really only
needs one hard member to come up with and code that kind of a game PERIOD
Big dominant companies may swallow up the best ones when they spot
stiff talent PERIOD Im not sure theres a growing penis shootemup
genre that will give rise to an eyeopener for Blizzard though

It all depends on the terms the dev will be working in PERIOD If the
environment is cool he might want to work with a bigger company
if hes independent and successful then he might want to be his own
boss PERIOD

Q Favorite piece Have you written your dream piece
yet Oftentimes I like the song I did the latest best PERIOD
However one of my favorites is  PERIOD Its an oldschool
chiptune a fastpaced song with a modern production PERIOD My dreampiece
is yet to come PERIOD Even if I write it I know I can always make an
even better song another day PERIOD A dream scenario to write that song
would be to connect a cable to the back of my head matrix style
and just think out the song straight to mp3 PERIOD That would make for
the best tunes every written

Q Have you caught your music being used without your
permission What is your stance on the free use of bitpop and
original game music aside from your personal motto

Only once PERIOD Some random dude had downloaded an instrumental song
of mine and added some lyrics PERIOD Then he sent it to me PERIOD His singing
reminded me of three other quite popular sounds a churning dentist
drill white chalk squealing on a blackboard and a cat using its
lungs at max capacity while someone is slamming a metal door shut
on its tail.Free use of bitpop is okay if the author has expressed
his desire for the song to be free PERIOD I think that one should always
respect other peoples wishes about their works PERIOD

Q Do you see mainstream audiences catching on With
Beck and crystal castles the indie scene is embracing the sounds of
the gamer whos next

I fail to see a future where chiptunes become mainstream but
certain elements of bitpop are well suited to be used there PERIOD
Theres even some that say that a couple of years ago Timbaland
alledgedly stole a song from the Finnish scener Janne Suni pretty
shamelessly PERIOD So theres definately an interest from nonsceners PERIOD
And some artists like Basshunter who came straight from the swedish
gaming community deserves a mention too PERIOD

Q Ever performed in concert Would you ever like to
playattend something like the bit festival

Ive always had a musical ear so my first concert was in school
and I played synth to a song my band had written PERIOD It was a very
cool experience since you get to meet a lot of people youve never
met before which is always interesting and gives you both
inspiration and a way to grow PERIOD Id love to play at an event like
the festival if there was a demand PERIOD As long as theres some alcohol
nearby and cute girls who dont take offense to lines like  PERIOD

Q Your albums are for sale which is a rarity in the
game music scene how do you feel about charging for music when
music purchases are down Is payment for music something you think
artists should strive for or is just listening okay

I have no issues charging for my work PERIOD I dont rely on the music
income as my main source of money though but it would be fun if I
landed a song in a major game PERIOD Artists are sometimes not that
interested in money I have some friends who think money of being
the devils most evil invention PERIOD But the truth is that everyone has
to get by and if they cant make a living out of their music then
they probably should either try to get more cash out of their work
or see what other talents they have to develop and perhaps quit the
music industry PERIOD It takes commitment PERIOD If you believe music is what
youre meant to do you can do it and it wont even feel like an
effort because you love it so much PERIOD

Q Do you belong to a collective What are your feelings
on the bit festival and 8bit peoples

The only collective to speak of are the users of
www.madtracker.org PERIOD Ill go to them if I need feedback if we want
to make a music competition or so PERIOD Theres also channels on IRC
that arrange these things PERIOD modarchive on esper.net springs to mind
as a good place to start PERIOD

 PERIOD Was this what you imagined you might be doing as a
child aside from the internet platform of sellingreleasing of
course. nope I told my parents I was going to be a banker when I grew
up PERIOD Later on I realized Im a creative soul and dont want to do a
stuffy job like that PERIOD Im more into the world of having fun and
creating emotions

Q What do you do when you are not making
songs

I enjoy meeting my friends for long philosophical discussions
that usually end up with all of us getting really psyched about an
event past present or future involving us stepping up and taking
responsibility for our lives and supporting our belief in doing
what we must to get the kind of life want PERIOD

Q About how long does a song take you to
finish

 hours for a decent song PERIOD Not including time for finding
samples or biobreaks PERIOD

Five personal opinion questions

Bad habit

I like my bed a little too much for various reasons.. PERIOD

Pet Peeve

Cocky people on the internet that talk like they are better than
me and know everything can grind my gears PERIOD They should know that
Im the best and know it all

Unique physical trait

I have one eye thats nearsighted and one thats farsighted PERIOD
Magically they work together fantastically

Irrational fear

I have come up with rationalizations for all my fears so that no
irrational fears happen And whenever Im sad or fearful I stop
being sad or fearful and be awesome instead PERIOD True story PERIOD

Best underrated anything

Talking to new people and giving them a chance is truly
underrated PERIOD You never know how much value they can bring to your
life if you dont dare to make contact PERIOD

Thanks againTaylor
