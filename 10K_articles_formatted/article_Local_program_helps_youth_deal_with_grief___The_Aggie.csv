Since its foundation in  the Stepping Stones support program has helped children and teens that have experienced the death of a loved one face their grief and begin the healing process PERIOD

Organized by the Yolo Hospice program participants meet in a group setting twice a month to learn how to acknowledge their loss and to develop coping skills PERIOD The program provides a supportive community of peers all of whom have experienced some type of loss PERIOD Denise Rose bereavement services manager for the Yolo Hospice said that having grief in common makes it easier for the kids to open up about their thoughts and emotions PERIOD

Rose said that right now the Stepping Stones program is in the process of expanding PERIOD So far the children and teen groups have been successful and the Yolo Hospice also runs programs for adults and children ages three to five PERIOD However there is no program for young adults specifically individuals aged  to  PERIOD

They dont fit in to the adult group Rose said but they arent teenagers either. the Yolo Hospice has designated space for the group and hopes to have it up and running by April PERIOD

The program currently offers two different sessions the childrens group for kids aged six to  and the teens group for older kids aged  to  PERIOD Beginning in March the groups will meet on alternating Thursdays PERIOD

Aja Michael the Stepping Stones program coordinator described the sessions as starting with an opening circle followed by unstructured play time and then ending with a closing circle PERIOD

According to Michael during the opening circle participants are asked to say their name age the name of the person who has died as well as how that person died PERIOD The kids are also invited to describe a favorite memory of the deceased or to say what the hardest part about the death has been for them PERIOD

The kids are encouraged to respond Michael said but they dont have to PERIOD Its up to them. michael explained that one of the goals is to create a safe environment where the kids do not feel pressured into participating PERIOD She also said that it is part of the healing process to have them make their own decisions including how to spend their unstructured play time PERIOD

For the childrens group kids have the ability to choose from puppets a sand tray costumes arts and crafts Legos or blocks PERIOD Teens can play music or can pursue art journaling poetry games or physical activity PERIOD Some prefer to just hang out and talk PERIOD
