Meet the District  supervisor candidate Amy Reichert

Julius McChristian and starting strong safety. for the past three seasons the two have gone hand in hand PERIOD If there was one constant on the San Diego State football team it was McChristian PERIOD

And now after three seasons of hard hits and leaping interceptions McChristian must now prepare himself for one of his biggest jumps yet while at SDSU moving from safety to linebacker PERIOD

The idea of a player moving from a position that hes played since high school and expecting him to excel is mindboggling PERIOD But this isnt any ordinary player PERIOD

Hes got the right mindset in terms of how hes approaching the linebacking position Aztecs linebacker coach Jeff Fitzgerald said PERIOD He takes a lot of pride in his play and hes dedicated himself to learning the things he needs to learn to excel. strong safety and linebacker conjure up two completely different images PERIOD However the move to linebacker is one McChristian and the entire coaching staff believe hes extremely suited for PERIOD

Last season I was playing more as a linebacker so I dont think its that big of a move because it gives me more of a chance to showcase my talents McChristian said PERIOD I think Im more of a runstopper so the move will be better for me and the defense in general. improving the defense was the primary reason behind the coaching staffs decision to switch McChristian PERIOD The move which was made during the offseason was a decision that was helped along by the departure of last years starting linebacker Craigus Thompson PERIOD

However the move does not guarantee McChristian a starting position next fall PERIOD He currently is battling soontobe sophomore Scott Johnson for the third linebacker or zip linebacker position PERIOD

Theres always going to be somebody else whos going to want to start before I do so the competitions going to be there regardless of the position Im playing McChristian said PERIOD The move has given me the drive to go out and make even more plays than I made last year. making plays according to Fitzgerald wont be a problem for the diminutive but powerful fivefootten 205pound senior PERIOD What McChristian lacks in height he more than makes up for in hits PERIOD

His position is more freelance than any of the three linebacker positions we have so he wont have to constantly take on blockers Fitzgerald said PERIOD But when he has to hell be more than capable PERIOD Hes probably one of the strongest linebackers we have. while he may be one of the strongest linebackers hes no longer  one of the strongest defensive backs PERIOD And according to cornerback Eric Lewis hell be missed PERIOD

Were going to miss his intensity in the secondary more than anything but wherever you put him on the field hes going to fly around and make plays Lewis said PERIOD",Tackling a new position â€“ The Daily Aztec,San Diego State University
