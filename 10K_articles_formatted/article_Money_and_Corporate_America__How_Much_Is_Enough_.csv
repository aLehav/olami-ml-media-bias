VIEWPOINT Money and Corporate America How Much Is Enough By Bryan Stockton
When it comes to money there never seems to be enough to go around PERIOD
Or so I thought until I started looking for summer employment PERIOD How much does it pay usually was the first question that came to my mind in the job search PERIOD As a student far away from home I depend on my summer income to pay for entertainment and meals during the rest of the year PERIOD For the most part the more money I make over the summer the more fun I can afford to have during the year PERIOD Supporting myself through the year stems more from pride than anything else PERIOD Unfortunately I was forced to eliminate many interesting internships from my search because these companies were not offering any compensation PERIOD
Caught in the midst of an economic downturn some private corporations temporarily scaled back on their hiring PERIOD This seems rational As income declines expenses must as well PERIOD
Well its not so simple PERIOD This is where the issue of corporate salaries comes in PERIOD Recent articles in The Economist and The New York Times examined executive compensation during a mild recession PERIOD The journalists wondered whether executives would trim their own salaries and benefits often performance based as revenues decreased PERIOD The results are mixed but nevertheless disappointing PERIOD Many companies like Boeing or Eli Lilly reduced the compensation packages of their executives PERIOD But at a few other companies managers apparently can give their employees the pink slip and line their pockets at the same time PERIOD
Ad
At these companies executives still received enormous bonuses even as their companies stocks fell PERIOD Kmarts board voted to grant millions of dollars of last minute bonuses even as the company headed toward bankruptcy PERIOD One chief executive officer was able to pocket over  million a  percent increase over the previous year even as the companys net income fell  percent and the stock price dropped about  percent PERIOD In another example Ciscos CEO received  million while company shareholders lost almost  percent PERIOD And yet Im told that there is not enough money for a paid internship program or enough to pay the lowest employees more than the minimum wage PERIOD
It seems that the American dream has been slowly distorted into a selfish desperate grasp for more and more money PERIOD According to The New York Times executives at Enron Oracle Sun and Xerox allegedly have all released misleading financial statements at one time or another hoping to prop up their stock prices before selling at a profit PERIOD As seen in the Enron scandal excessive corporate greed has consequences on the bottom line and ultimately harms both investors and employees PERIOD In a matter of days as rumors turned into facts one of the largest companies in the world simply disappeared PERIOD
The entrepreneurial drive for profits has allowed Americans to enjoy their high standard of living and fostered a vibrant democracy PERIOD Yet the willingness of so many people to seek more and more money at the cost of employees shareholders and consumers threatens to undermine confidence in American capitalism PERIOD
I realize that this may be the current nature of the game but I dont like the rules PERIOD I understand that the real world is more cutthroat and less idealistic than a college campus PERIOD But maybe the real world needs a wakeup call PERIOD And only we can provide it PERIOD As many of us graduate from Georgetown and leave the Healy Gates for the glass towers of New York or Boston how will we act What values will guide our behavior This is deeper than silly internship programs or executive compensation PERIOD Will we succumb to temptation and seek money at any cost or will anything we learned at Georgetown  from a theology or philosophy class to extracurricular experiences  shape our actions If it is the former Georgetown has failed its purpose PERIOD Fortunately though Im not willing to lose hope for the future PERIOD
But as for the present Im not so sure PERIOD Ill hear back from companies next week PERIOD I know the moneys there the right values are not PERIOD
