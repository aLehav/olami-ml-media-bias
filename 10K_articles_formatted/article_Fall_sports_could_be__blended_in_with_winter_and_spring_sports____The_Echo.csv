Cal Lutheran sports teams await Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference approval for all sports to resume in spring  PERIOD

Ariana Salinas ReporterSeptember  

California Universities are looking into the possibility of moving their fall  sports seasons to the coming spring so all studentathletes have the opportunity to participate in their respective sports PERIOD

In an email interview Jim McHugh associate vice president for Athletic Affairs at California Lutheran University said that while there is no set schedule for spring or winter sports if a schedule is created fall sports would be blended in with the winter and spring sports playing a conferenceonly schedule PERIOD

We are really hoping that if the plan is approved by the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference presidents and the state and county regulations allow fall sports will be able to be played in the spring McHugh said PERIOD

McHugh said shifting the fall  sports into winter and spring would not effect their  season it would instead create an expanded nontraditional season PERIOD Each team will have scheduled usage times for shared athletic facilities PERIOD

While many athletes are eager to get back to playing the sports they love the stands are not going to be as they were before COVID19 PERIOD

Currently there is no plan to have fans in the stands at the games PERIOD Students and families will be able to see the games streamed online McHugh said PERIOD

Limiting the number of people at each sporting event will hopefully decrease the spread of COVID19 among athletes coaches referees and spectators PERIOD

McHugh shared that Cal Lutheran Athletics currently doesnt know what the COVID19 testing protocols will look like in the spring PERIOD However right now the state requires that college athletics have a COVID testing plan in order for athletes to return to practice and compete such as frequency of testing and those testing positive being placed in isolation PERIOD

The NCAA is also requiring testing with results obtained within  hours for eligibility to compete in highcontact sports PERIOD

In regards to funding fall winter and spring sports simultaneously in spring  McHugh said that each sport will use the same funding they would have used for their original  season PERIOD

Health and safety are paramount when trying to figure out what sports can play in a pandemic said former Cal Lutheran president Chris Kimball in aninterview with the Ventura County Star PERIOD
