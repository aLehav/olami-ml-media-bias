According to the Oxford Dictionary the definition of a friend isa person whom one knows and with whom one has a bond of mutual affection typically exclusive of sexual or family relations. there is no way that anyone can share a bond of mutual affection with the hundreds and sometimes thousands of people that they claim to be friends with on Facebook PERIOD The social media site has totally changed our classification of what a friend is and it is for the worst PERIOD

Ten years ago we had a group of people ranging anywhere from five or so to  tops that we referred to as friends PERIOD We saw each other in person and helped one another out when it was necessary and thats what a friend is supposed to be a person who you can count on PERIOD Try to convince me that you could count on the  people on Facebook that you carelessly refer to as your friend PERIOD

Facebook should adopt a method similar to the extremely unpopular Google Plus and have designated circles that classify your relationship to someone appropriately PERIOD We dont have to be friends with everyone PERIOD What ever happened to acquaintances The whole idea of having the most friends has caused people to feel the need to socialize  PERIOD Checking your Facebook wall has become something as standard as using the bathroom PERIOD Youll hear people complaining about being so busy that they dont have the time to exercise or eat right yet they have no problem updating their status to tell you how swamped they are at work PERIOD

This phenomenon has also desensitized the younger generation to what friendship really is PERIOD Youll hear teenagers all the time claiming to be friends with various celebrities PERIOD But the reality is that Snooki has never heard of you and she is not your friend PERIOD It also leaves kids unaware of the difference between being friendly and being friends PERIOD Youre friendly with someone to be polite but being friends with someone means you share the intricate details of your personal life PERIOD You dont belong doing that with everyone that can view your Facebook page PERIOD Where is the trust

Another epidemic that has partially been caused by our haphazard process by which we become friends is the erosion of people skills PERIOD You no longer need them PERIOD Youre allowed to sit at a table full of people and never say a word PERIOD Your smartphone is the only tool required to socialize PERIOD Who needs the measly five people that I see on a daytoday basis when I have hundreds of people on Facebook waiting for me comment on their latest photo that they uploaded

The term we need to catch up is extinct PERIOD There is no longer any need to be out of the loop PERIOD If this idea of befriending everyone weve ever come into contact with and following their every move was introduced  years ago it would have been looked at as borderline stalking PERIOD

The days of living breathing social interaction are long gone PERIOD Talking is prehistoric and Facebook is the majority shareholder in the blame category PERIOD
