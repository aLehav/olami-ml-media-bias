8439,2023-11-05,"sandy Park Stadium home of the Exeter University Rugby Club was filled with students decked out in greenandwhite with beers in hand PERIOD The game was about to start and I was excited to watch rugby for the first time PERIOD My friends and I wanted to get into the spirit of it  a do as the Romans do mindset  so we each bought a pint and set off to find our seats PERIOD As we walked around the stadium a stray ball was kicked our way during warmup knocking my full pint to the ground PERIOD While a waste of two quid and a perfectly good Fosters it was a memorable start to my first rugby game PERIOD

The game capped a week of new cultural experiences PERIOD Interestingly enough these were not solely British PERIOD Living in a community of international students has provided me with the opportunity to learn about many different cultures PERIOD Watching rugby learning to make homemade dumplings for Lunar New Year and celebrating Carnival were all new adventures for me PERIOD

My Australian friend Winnie was raised by her firstgeneration Chinese immigrant parents PERIOD Lunar New Year is perhaps the most important holiday in China PERIOD Winnie normally celebrates it with a weeklong series of meals parties and firework shows with her extended family PERIOD This was her first time away from her parents on this important holiday which was difficult to say the least PERIOD

Instead of wallowing Winnie introduced us to Lunar New Year by teaching us to make homemade dumplings PERIOD Everything was prepared from scratch including the dough meat and vegetable fillings PERIOD One benefit of studying abroad is that I have expanded my culinary skills PERIOD Prior to coming to Exeter my culinary pursuits mostly consisted of boiling pasta making grilled cheese and preparing a mean bowl of cereal PERIOD Knowing how to make both steamed and fried dumplings has helped me step up my cooking game PERIOD

The scene was humorous PERIOD We were a group of about  people from Germany the Netherlands Switzerland France Australia and the U.S PERIOD As university students we did not have all of the necessary tools to prepare the food PERIOD One inventive step we took was using sanitized wine bottles as rolling pins PERIOD Ah the life of a college student PERIOD

The dumplings were delicious and even though the process took about five hours in total we had a wonderful time celebrating a study abroad style Lunar New Year PERIOD But the broadening of my cultural horizons was not over yet PERIOD Saturday night we all attended a belated Carnival party PERIOD

Carnival celebrates the beginning of Lent PERIOD Around the world this festive season is observed in many different ways PERIOD Most famous perhaps is Rio de Janeiros Carnival party or the American take on the holiday  Mardi Gras PERIOD The hosts of this party were German and Dutch PERIOD In their respective nations Carnival used to mean a couple days of masquerade parties PERIOD It has now developed into general costume parties all over Germany and the Netherlands PERIOD It symbolizes carefree revelry and selfindulgence before the abstemiousness of Lent PERIOD

Of course the party was good fun PERIOD Seeing all the costumes was very entertaining PERIOD The Old Spice guy Tom Cruise from Top Gun and Twiggy all made appearances PERIOD In a way it made me feel like I was back at a theme party at the College of William and Mary PERIOD But instead of just being another party there was a purpose We were ringing in Carnival PERIOD

I cant stress how amazing it has been to have such a wide variety of new cultural experiences PERIOD Coming to Exeter I expected to go to a rugby game have cream tea and go to pubs PERIOD When I imagined going to a rugby game I did not predict the tragic fate of my pint but I was really not expecting to learn so much about other cultures PERIOD I think thats been one of the greatest gifts from my time in Exeter PERIOD
