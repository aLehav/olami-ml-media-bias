2457,2023-11-04,"illinois Tracy Abrams  dunks under Michigans Glen Robinson III  during their game at State Farm Center on Tuesday March  PERIOD The Illini lost  PERIOD

By Johnathan Hettinger March  

No PERIOD  Michigan only needed two points in the second half to beat Illinois and win an outright Big Ten Championship PERIOD It scored  PERIOD

After holding four straight opponents below  points the Illinois defense got burned for  points in the first half PERIOD The Wolverines came out hitting on all cylinders shooting . percent overall and . percent on 3pointers in the first half PERIOD

The Wolverines cooled off a bit in the second half shooting . percent from the field and . percent from long range but still beat the Illini  in the worst loss in State Farm Center history PERIOD

Michigan clinched its first outright Big Ten Championship since  in what head coach John Beilein said was the teams best performance of the year PERIOD

Weve had some very good games this year but none like that Beilein said PERIOD I havent seen that in practice even. derrick Walton Jr PERIOD started the shooting clinic a little bit less than two minutes in hitting the first of Michigans  3pointers  tied for the best performance by an Illinois opponent in program history PERIOD Nik Stauskas hit seven of nine 3point attempts and scored  points to lead the Wolverines PERIOD

But Stauskas wasnt alone PERIOD Zak Irvin went 3for5 from beyond the arc while Caris LeVert was 2for3 and Spike Albrecht went 2for2 from deep PERIOD Glenn Robinson and Walton each added one more longball PERIOD

Its kind of contagious when one guy gets going we just kind of fed off it Stauskas said PERIOD

At the end of the day the difference was the 3point line head coach John Groce said PERIOD Illinois was outscored  on 3pointers PERIOD

In order to get a result like this we have to play really poor and they have to play really great Groce said PERIOD Its a lot more fun when youre on the positive side of the perfect storm. junior Rayvonte Rice who led the Illini with  points nine rebounds and three assists said Illinois defense wasnt bad Michigans offense was just that good PERIOD

Lately weve been playing great defense Rice said PERIOD They would just knock down every open shot they got. freshman Kendrick Nunn was the only other Illini in double figures scoring  points PERIOD

Freshman Malcolm Hill shot 1for5 but Beilein said he wouldnt worry about it PERIOD

He is a really talented player that Illinois should embrace PERIOD Just watching him in the Michigan State game hes a heck of a player Beilein said PERIOD

In their last game at State Farm Center the presence of seniors Jon Ekey and Joseph Bertrand was hardly felt PERIOD Bertrand hurt his knee early and scored just two points while Ekey added four PERIOD

Illinois came into this game with positive momentum following its win at No PERIOD  Michigan State on Saturday but that momentum faltered against the Wolverines PERIOD Groce said it will take a great amount of mental toughness to bounce back at No PERIOD  Iowa on Saturday PERIOD

Still Groce said Illinois has been playing its best basketball of the year lately and it ran into the Wolverines on a historically bad night PERIOD
