The lights of the Yvonne Theater spotlighted a multitude of talents this past weekend as Rider students put on their first inperson festival titled Rider New Works PERIOD The production featured a diverse and innovative collection of eight 10minute plays all studentwritten ranging from a murderous prom date gone wild an unexpected wedding love triangle and a dramatic unexpected runin with an exgirlfriend all of which garnered laughter surprise and emotion from audience members PERIOD

While the COVID19 pandemic brought the derailment of many students college experiences especially performing arts majors who were unable to practice their craft in person Rider New Works was born from the need for innovative virtual collaboration PERIOD

Due to performances being held over Zoom the performance rights to many plays were not being granted to college students to perform virtually because playwrights not wanting their work streamed online PERIOD

Robin Shane assistant professor of theater and the producer of New Works came up with the concept of holding a new works festival at Rider in the form of short films PERIOD After a successful festival last year they decided to hold it again this time in person PERIOD

We need to allow the students to have a place to express their voices and the things that theyre thinking about said Shane PERIOD As we were deciding on the season for this year I and a couple of colleagues convinced the rest of the department to do and to take a chance on doing another night of 10minute plays PERIOD  Some undergraduate institutions have studentproduced plays but theyre very rarely supported in this way by the department as part of the mainstage season. rider New Works has given students the unique opportunity to get involved with playwriting costume design stage production and more PERIOD Sophomore technical theater major Blake Gonzales said Every single thing is done by students except for the directing and the actual production. many students involved branched outside of the direct parameters of their major to exercise their creativity PERIOD Sophomore musical theater major Carly Walton was one of the many students behind the new plays being performed this weekend PERIOD

It feels nice to be recognized for something other than performing PERIOD  Im really interested in a bunch of things she said PERIOD

Waltons play The French Lesson portrays conflicts pertaining to queer couples specifically in regards to closeting in relationships PERIOD

I wanted to get representation for gay women specifically Walton said citing the underrepresentation she typically sees in the media PERIOD

Gonzales wrote the play Passed Connection a story about a woman talking to a man at a bar only to lead audience members to a twist ending revealing that he was her exboyfriend who died tragically and she was just envisioning him PERIOD

Gonzalez said This is the firstever production that Ive had where I wrote it and completed it and actually got to see it put up. the festival also featured freshmen students who normally are not allowed to audition for mainstage events PERIOD Liberty Ashe a freshman acting major had three roles in the production including the role of a mustacheclad boisterous high school football coach with impeccable comedic timing which ignited the audience with laughter throughout A Kings Choice by senior English major Matt Zadera PERIOD

I decided to audition for the show because I really wanted to get myself on stage again after the pandemic Ashe said PERIOD The entire process has been so freeing and creative. kyle Metzger and Rose Freeman were the guest directors of the Rider New Works festival PERIOD

Freeman who directed the first half of the festival said So many people were wearing multiple hats in this production and that was something really exhilarating to see because it reflects a lot of what earlycareer or communityminded work has within the world. metzger directed the second half of the festival PERIOD I love working with college students because they are always willing to try anything and thats the most important thing about making art is to not be afraid to fail and take risks said Metzger PERIOD

The Rider New Works festival represented unique collaborations between students who were able to tell their own stories for the first time in person after the COVID19 pandemic caused struggles for musical theater as a whole PERIOD

Nicole Duffy sophomore musical theater major said It feels really cool to be the first person to ever do these plays because who knows where theyre going to go.",Students shine in peer written plays â€“ The Rider News,Rider University
