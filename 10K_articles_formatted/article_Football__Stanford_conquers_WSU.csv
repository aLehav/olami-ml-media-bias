5290,2010-10-25,"following nearly a decade of futility Stanfords football team is bowleligible for the second consecutive year after defeating Washington State  on Saturday afternoon at Stanford Stadium PERIOD The No PERIOD  Cardinal improves to  on the season and  in the Pac10 while the Cougars fall to  overall and  in conference play PERIOD

The  start is Stanfords best record through seven games in  years PERIOD

While the game ended in a victory for Stanford the result was somewhat disappointing for the Cardinal PERIOD Washington State entered Saturdays game as the conferences unquestioned cellardweller having lost four straight conference games PERIOD Its only victory this season came on a lastsecond drive against Montana State an FCS team PERIOD The Card was expected to blow out the Cougars with ease but Washington State refused to cave late in the game and kept it close to the final whistle PERIOD

We knew it was going to be a fight said Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh PERIOD This was a good football team we played PERIOD We did more things right than they did and we won the ball game. coming off its bye week Stanford seemed sluggish and rusty on its opening drives PERIOD After an early interception by senior linebacker Owen Marecic gave the Card the ball on the WSU sevenyard line for its opening drive Stanford only managed to muster five yards settling for a field goal despite its starting field position PERIOD The Cardinal rushing attack looked especially weak as the Cougar front seven routinely stuffed sophomore running back Stepfan Taylor PERIOD

Despite scoring a touchdown on its next drive Stanford still didnt look terribly sharp against a Washington State defense ranked among the worst in the nation in numerous statistical categories PERIOD

It was a little disappointing said redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck PERIOD We were a little sluggishit didnt feel like we ever got in a rhythm PERIOD Washington State deserves credit PERIOD They did a good job of putting us in tough situations. stanfords defense on the other hand played well early in the game PERIOD The muchmaligned unit forced the Cougars into turnovers and punts on their first three possessions and only gave up one touchdown through the first three quarters PERIOD

However much of that success came courtesy of a strong run defense that dominated the line of scrimmage all afternoon PERIOD Sophomore quarterback Jeff Tuel the WSU starter had a strong day against a Stanford secondary that sorely missed junior safety Delano Howell who was out with an undisclosed injury PERIOD Tuel ended the day with an impressive stat line2128 passing for  yards four touchdowns and two interceptions PERIOD

Hes a really composed poised quarterback who made a lot of accurate throws in the ball game Harbaugh said of Tuel PERIOD Hes an impressive quarterback. three of those touchdowns came on Washington States last three drives of the game as the Cougars attempted to mount a late comeback as the game wound down in the fourth quarter PERIOD The final frame began with Stanford leading  but the final score of  felt a little too close for comfort PERIOD

Defensive lapses especially hurt Stanford toward the end of the quarter as Washington State receivers found and exploited gaps in the Stanford secondary PERIOD A desperation pass by Tuel found receiver Marquess Wilson for a 74yard touchdown as time wound down in the fourth quarter but it was too little and too late to prevent the Cougars from taking their seventh loss of the season PERIOD

After the game Harbaugh expressed his unhappiness at the defensive lapses in the fourth quarter many of which happened after he had removed his starters from the game PERIOD

Were playing with young freshman safeties in there and they have to step up PERIOD There are no excuses he said PERIOD You have to make the play and at least do what youre supposed to be doing. we came ready to playthere were just mental lapses said sophomore linebacker Shayne Skov PERIOD We made a couple of mistakes PERIOD We had a lot of opportunities especially in that fourth quarter but we just let them slip by. while Stanfords defense faltered late in the game its offense continued to show why its considered one of the best units in the country even after its listless firstquarter performance PERIOD As the Cardinal amassed a decent lead it went to an effective strategy of short passes and runs up the middle to eat time off the clock and keep Tuel off the field PERIOD

Luck had yet another strong day under center going  for  yards three touchdowns and an interception PERIOD However he still felt that the Cardinal should have done better given the caliber of its opponent PERIOD

We just didnt play up to our standards he said PERIOD Thats what it boils down to. lucks receiving corps played strongly though it is still hamstrung by injuries to key players PERIOD Junior wide receiver Chris Owusu who appeared fully recovered from a knee injury that had kept him out of Stanfords early schedule did not play against the Cougars and will likely take some more time to recover before returning to full health PERIOD Senior receiver Ryan Whalen who has recently been limited by an elbow injury came back strong catching six passes for  yards and a touchdown PERIOD

The running attack led by Taylor also picked up considerably after falling flat on Stanfords early drives PERIOD Taylor finished with one of the best days of his Stanford career running the ball  times for  yards and two touchdowns PERIOD True freshman Anthony Wilkerson added  yards on nine carries PERIOD

The game was played in front of a halfempty Stanford Stadium as the chilly rainy conditions drove many fans away as the game wore on PERIOD Even the student section was nowhere close to capacity PERIOD

Stanfords win has bowl implications for both teams PERIOD With six wins the Cardinal is now bowleligible for the second consecutive year while the Cougars were officially eliminated from earning a bowl berth PERIOD

While Washington State is left to look forward to next season Stanford isnt satisfied with merely earning bowl eligibility PERIOD The Cardinal still has a daunting Pac10 slate ahead starting next weekend at Washington PERIOD The Huskies have had an inconsistent season beating USC and Oregon State while losing to Arizona State in Pac10 play and will provide a significant challenge to the Card PERIOD

Coach Harbaugh has set a standard here and that standard certainly isnt just being bowleligible Luck said PERIOD
