6794,2023-07-26,"current and former Ithaca College faculty members founded a company called Assistance in Motion to research build and distribute technology in the hopes of bringing mobility to young children with motor disabilities PERIOD

Carole Dennis a cofounder of Assistance in Motion and professor emerita in the Department of Occupational Therapy OT and Sharon Stansfield the other cofounder and professor in the Department of Computer Science began research at the college in  with grant funding from the National Science Foundation NSF to fill the gap they noticed in mobility aids for infants and toddlers with motor disabilities PERIOD Dennis said the research team also has included more than  students over the years PERIOD

Dennis said the technology that already exists to assist infants and toddlers were joystickoperated and she wanted to make something more accessible PERIOD She said infants and toddlers often do not have the capability to operate joysticks especially children with motor disabilities making current robotic solutions ineffective PERIOD

Kids learn so much from  exploration Dennis said PERIOD The inaccessibility just frustrated me as an OT PERIOD  It would make sense we believe for children with disabilities to have mobility from as early a time as typically developing babies. dennis said their solution is the WeeBot a handsfree robot that infants and toddlers can sit on and control with small shifts on the seat PERIOD She said that because the robot does not require a switch or a joystick children can reach for objects and interact with people when using it PERIOD Infants as young as five months old can control the WeeBot and once the children learn to use it Dennis said movement increases significantly PERIOD

Our motivation is to help these children Dennis said PERIOD They can control the world they live in through their mobility PERIOD Otherwise kids with disabilities  pretty much sit in one place and the world comes to them. embedyt httpswww.youtube.comwatchv5WTlhyZcbOwembedyt

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the most common form of motor disability is cerebral palsy which affects up to . or about one in   of children PERIOD According to the University of Melbourne other motor disabilities that can impact children include spinal cord injuries muscular dystrophy and spina bifida PERIOD

Dennis said that other faculty members at the college have been involved with research from early stages including Julie Dorsey professor and chair of the Department of Occupational Therapy PERIOD Dorsey said her eldest child who was nine months old in the fall of  was the first child to test out the WeeBot PERIOD

Dennis knew I had a little one and asked if Id be willing to bring her in to do some testing Dorsey said PERIOD As a parent bringing a kid in  I remember being really impressed with the way that students were involved with the research even early on. dorsey said she learned from the researchers about how infants explore their environment and how to make learning accessible PERIOD

It was really impressive to see the students and their level of commitment to the research Dorsey said PERIOD Everyone has to be flexible and creative. madeline Smith  began working on research with Stansfield in summer  through an NSFfunded internship while she was finishing her undergraduate degree as a computer science major PERIOD

Getting involved with research at Ithaca College totally changed the direction of my life Smith said PERIOD Seeing that I could use my technical computer science skills on projects that could help people  was really exciting to me. smith said she was on a research team with two other students where they did background research literature reviews and brainstormed and tested solutions for the Weebot PERIOD

It was very much a collaborative project  understanding the problem and the technology Smith said PERIOD As a group we came up with the concept to test out different control methods. smith said the WeeBots drive system was inspired by the Wii Balance Board a platform that can detect shifts in weight when connected to Wii games PERIOD

One of the students said I think the Wii Board could do all of the movements  so thats basically how we got started with a research prototype Dennis said PERIOD We couldnt have completed our research without the support of students. in  Dennis and Stansfield asked Chuck Schwerin managing director of business services for Tompkins County Area Development to be their business mentor PERIOD The two professors formed the company Assistance in Motion in January  and Dennis said she retired from the college at the end of  PERIOD

Dennis said there were issues with the initial prototype like affordability and accessibility PERIOD The robot worked but it cost  to assemble one robot and Dennis said their goal was to make the robot financially accessible for families PERIOD The robot would also get stuck in corners and was hard to transport because of its size PERIOD

Dennis said they need a second prototype which requires additional funding PERIOD Between  and  Dennis and Stansfield have received over  in grant funding from NSF Cornell ICorps and the New York Physical Therapy Association PERIOD Their most recent grant was from NSF for  which will be used to fund the new WeeBot prototype PERIOD

The college has been very supportive of the research particularly in the times between grant funding when the project could have ground to a halt Stansfield said PERIOD

Dennis said the next steps for Assistance in Motion involve meeting with engineers and other skilled professionals to complement Dennis and Stansfields skills PERIOD Stansfield said that once they have a better prototype they will either sell the robots themselves or find another organization to sell them PERIOD

Were in it until it looks like its getting to the children that need it Stansfield said PERIOD Thats been the whole purpose all along. your donation will support The Ithacans student journalists in their effort to keep the Ithaca College and wider Ithaca community informed PERIOD Your contribution will allow us to purchase equipment and cover our annual website hosting costs PERIOD
