The latest biannual survey asked  riders how pleased they were with BART services last year PERIOD Only  percent of the BART riders surveyed said they were satisfied last year compared to  percent in  and  percent in  PERIOD

The negative ratings came after BART experienced one of its most turbulent years in operation with several violent crimes and sanitary issues making the news in  PERIOD The fatal stabbing of 18yearold Nia Wilson at MacArthur Station in July and two prior homicides that month prompted BART officials to boost safety and security measures in August PERIOD

Satisfaction with BART safety cleanliness and law enforcement all declined by more than  percent according to the  survey PERIOD Some  percent of riders stated they used BART less because it was too dirty  percent because of crime concerns and  percent due to overcrowded trains PERIOD

One survey respondent wrote The No PERIOD  problem with BART right now is the sheer volume of homeless people and mentally ill on BART PERIOD My wife and coworkers often do not feel safe or clean on BART PERIOD Please find a way to fix this PERIOD Happy to pay more for this. some of the top issues listed in the BART survey included personal security homelessness lack of police presence and maintenance concerns PERIOD

Other survey participants said BART is unclean in addition to being unsafe PERIOD

The BART trains are generally very dirty and they smell of urine wrote a respondent PERIOD The floors are filthy and often times the seats are as well. rampant drug use on the BART system was another concern for riders after a hypodermic needle pricked a woman seated on a train in May last year PERIOD

Ive found needles urine fecal matter on seats PERIOD Homeless harassing riders PERIOD I feel unsafe all the time another respondent wrote PERIOD

A video posted by KPIX CBS showed drug users shooting up with needles in a hallway at Civic Center Station in April last year PERIOD

BART invested  million in new initiatives over the past  years to respond to these issues according to BART spokesperson Christopher Filippi PERIOD

We feel the results of BARTs biannual Customer Satisfaction Survey confirm quality of life issues are the correct priorities for BART to focus on Filippi said PERIOD

BART created an elevator attendant program homeless outreach team and a controversial fare enforcement initiative to combat some of the most common complaints for BART riders according to Filippi PERIOD

Newlyelected board director Janice Li said she would like to see BART continue to do more for the community PERIOD

I think BART is finally starting to acknowledge its role as a transit agency Li said in an interview with Xpress last year PERIOD Whether thats passing a Safe Transit Policy when sanctuary policies were under attack or piloting an elevator attendant program. bARTs Homeless Outreach Team contacted  individuals in its first year of operation from November  to November  PERIOD The team directed six people into shelters and six others into warming centers during the first week of January this year according to Filippi PERIOD
