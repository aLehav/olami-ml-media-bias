Tim Kaiser  Thursday December  

Saint Marys first win against Hope College since  will have to wait until February PERIOD

The Belles found themselves down big at the beginning of the second half and were unable to overcome the deficit before falling to the Flying Dutch  PERIOD

Hope came out firing after halftime and a  run in the first five minutes all but guaranteed victory PERIOD

They made great adjustments Saint Marys coach Steve Bender said of Hopes secondhalf onslaught PERIOD If you look at points in the paint  they just wore us down. hope jumped out to an early lead to begin the game as well going up  early in the first half but the Belles were able to cut the Dutch lead to nine and were down  at halftime PERIOD

I thought we played about as hard as we can play the first half Bender said PERIOD But offensively we were just so weak with the ball PERIOD

But keeping a team that averages  points to  at halftime I thought that was good. saint Marys strong first half came despite Hope being ranked No PERIOD  in the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association MIAA and having outscored its two previous opponents this season  PERIOD

The Flying Dutch also have won six of the last eight MIAA championships and are coached by Brian Morehouse who in his  seasons at Hope is the eighthwinningest coach in Division III womens basketball PERIOD

The first half was a step forward for our team and then it made us realize that OK this is the best team in the conference thats where weve got to go Bender said PERIOD Weve got to emulate what theyre doing. one area Bender believed the team improved in was rebounding  an earlyseason deficiency for the Belles PERIOD

I thought that as bad as it maybe looked that we werent boxing out that they only out rebounded us by one  Bender said PERIOD Like their coach said to me we had  offensive rebounds in the first half and nobodys done that against them for a long long time. the Belles have limited time to prepare before Fridays game at  p.m PERIOD at North Park University in Chicago but they still have a lot to improve on PERIOD

We just need to work on gaining some confidence on offense Bender said PERIOD Were just not scoring a lot and we can we have PERIOD Were up and down PERIOD Were so inexperienced theres just so many peaks and valleys we need to meet. weve got one practice tomorrow and our next game is Friday so obviously were going to work on getting ourselves in better positions offensively getting some better box out positions. share This Story

After this weekend the world of womens golf should have a shakeup at the.. PERIOD
