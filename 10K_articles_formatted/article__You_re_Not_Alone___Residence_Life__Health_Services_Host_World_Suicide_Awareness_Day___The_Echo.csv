Working as a mental health professional I see people coming in who dont feel loved and dont have people telling them they care about them PERIOD I think doing a lot of preventive work is really important to let people know beforehand that they matter Turner said PERIOD

Kolter said the little things matter when it comes to letting someone know you are thinking of them and care for them because it could just be the thing someone needs to hear PERIOD

Dont forget to text at least two people today and let them know that they matter to you and that they are lovedKolter said PERIOD
