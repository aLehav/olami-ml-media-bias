University of Georgia police have seen a  percent increase in thefts from the same time last year PERIOD

The number of reports in  is already more than double the amount reported at around this point of the last academic year PERIOD

An Archnews email sent by the UGA Police Department on Feb PERIOD  said the department had received  reports of theft and burglary on campus so far in the year  a  percent increase from the same time for the previous year PERIOD

Of the reported thefts  were from cars  were from rooms or offices and nine were in public areas PERIOD

Eleven of the car thefts were of valuables left in plain view PERIOD Five of them were from unlocked cars PERIOD Fifteen of the  thefts from offices or rooms involved unlocked rooms PERIOD All thefts from public areas involved items left unattended PERIOD

But UGA Police Chief Jimmy Williamson said he has noticed reports of theft slowing down after arresting a number of people responsible for many of the thefts PERIOD

Weve arrested a guy for breaking into cars and we think were going to connect it to a number of car break ins Williamson said PERIOD We are in the process of arresting a guy that was stealing bikes and were pretty much sure he was doing most if not all of our bike thefts. williamson said there are still people he calls opportunists will take the easy opportunities to steal when faced with the situation PERIOD

They are people that may not normally steal but if they see something thats really available you know when theres nothing to keep them from doing it they may not normally steal but in this situation they would Williamson said PERIOD Thats why its imperative for each and everyone of us to do things to reduce our exposure. williamson said this means students should never leave items unattended on campus to always conceal items left in a car and to always lock doors PERIOD

These things sound simple but the one time you dont maybe that person comes by and sees it and says oh thatd be easy. williamson said he thinks people who have found themselves in unfortunate circumstances may be the best people to help promote locking doors PERIOD

Leanna Miller a freshman animal science major from Statesboro had her backpack stolen from her car parked in the West Campus Deck last month PERIOD Even though all of her front doors were locked the thief discovered that the back hatch was unlocked PERIOD The person entered and took her bag which had a laptop calculator and school books together valued at  PERIOD

Im a freshman and nothing like this has ever happened to me Miller said PERIOD Im from a really small town PERIOD I was like this is crazy. although the textbooks will be returned to Miller her laptop will probably never be found she said PERIOD The experience taught her an important lesson PERIOD

I never leave my doors unlocked anymore in my car or my dorm and I tell all of my friends to do the same she said PERIOD

Another student Patrick Ward had his backpack which contained his laptop and other textbooks stolen late last year when he left it at his fraternity house on Milledge Avenue overnight PERIOD The total value was  PERIOD And when he came back the next morning it was gone PERIOD

I felt defeated and there wasnt much I could do said Ward a sophomore advertising major from Tampa Fla PERIOD I felt pretty confident that it was gone. ward later had to go through the process of reporting his losses PERIOD

My mom had insurance so I got  to  percent covered by insurance but my mom had to go through the whole process of filing claims and filing a police report Ward said PERIOD It was such a hassle. ward said he went to a small private high school and used to never lock doors PERIOD But he said he admits UGA was somewhat of a reality check. now I lock my doors no matter what Ward said PERIOD I dont sketch out or anything about it but its better to be safe than sorry. an oncoming vehicle struck a motorist near the intersection of Church Street and Broad Street on Monday afternoon PERIOD
