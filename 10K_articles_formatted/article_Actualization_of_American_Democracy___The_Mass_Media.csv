The foundation of democracy is the will of the people PERIOD The Democratic republic of the United States was premised on a system of proportional representation PERIOD So naturally representation of the population is a core tenant of our legislative system PERIOD But our system is flawed the will of the people has been stifled by economic inequality PERIOD Today the top  of the population holds over half our nations wealth PERIOD This extensive economic stratification has redefined the structure of our political system endowing the wealthiest members of society with disproportionate power PERIOD



Nearly half our nation does not vote PERIOD We are told we are lazy disinterested and apathetic and some of us are PERIOD But what about the rest of us the people who care that Africa is not a country and care that words are categorized in dictionaries not created in the imagination of George W PERIOD Bush What is stopping us Two reasons come to mind lack of education and more importantly the fact that voter registration laws include various populacesuppressing techniques PERIOD Examples of these include the secret ballot unreasonable limits on when a citizen can register and requiring multiple forms of I.D PERIOD

The question then becomes Why did this happen How did voting rates which were at  preceding the Jacksonian revolution of  fall to a dismal  and then slowly crawl up to the  average that we enjoy today1Our answer lies within the minds of the great entrepreneurs of the golden age the pioneers of monopoly the architects of corporatism and the firing squad of democracy PERIOD

This massive drop in turnout resulted from the consolidation that the American business sector went through in the 1890s PERIOD A highly diverse competitive economy turned into a select few titans.These companies with their newfound buying power were able to exert massive amounts of influence over the American Political system and did so in order to achieve their goals. restricting turnout made it easier and less expensive for the business elites preferred candidates to sweep elections and pass legislation exploiting the American public.These megacompanies forced out any candidate that represented the people or the workforce by outspending the opposition PERIOD Therefore political campaigns degenerated into the financial district v PERIOD the manufacturing district1 the will of the people forever being drowned in a sea of money PERIOD Each following generation has inherited this mockery of a political race and done nothing PERIOD Generations later we remain trapped in the crossfire of wealthy investor blocks seeking to gain access to political legislators PERIOD Now the echo boomers are up to bat and Cy Young is pitching PERIOD

In   years of campaign regulation was ruled unconstitutional PERIOD The Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Roberts decided that corporations have the same right as citizens to finance elections PERIOD The court stipulated that corporations free speech would be violated if they were not allowed to spend their treasury funds on campaign ads PERIOD Laughably Justice Kennedy who delivered the courts opinion came to the conclusion that if corporations were regulated in their spending then the government gained the right to shut down media outlets PERIOD He even went as far to say that with the current law the government would have legally been able to ban Mr PERIOD Smith Goes to Washington PERIOD It is so ordered. as a result of the Citizens United case . billion dollars were spent on political ads.In  a mainyear election only . billion was spent on congressional ad campaigns.4A nearly  increase from .3Furthermore interest groups spent  times as much in  as they did in  PERIOD Literally every minute of air time during prime time T.V PERIOD was devoted to some kind of political advertisement PERIOD The reality is this . billion can buy a legislature PERIOD

Giving true power back to the voter is a goal within our grasp.Thanks to the people of Tunisia and Egypt nonviolent opposition in the modern era has gone through the Valley of Death and come out alive PERIOD We the people have the ability to stand up to our state and tell them that we will no longer be controlled by Wall Street PERIOD We are done hearing about the jobless recovery while the Dow Jones Index is up to the boom levels of  PERIOD We are infuriated that the men behind one of the most illegal harmful premeditated financial blunders of our time are still at large living off the extravagant bonuses funded by the American taxpayer PERIOD Most of all we are furious that these men control our fate PERIOD This is our time for change PERIOD
