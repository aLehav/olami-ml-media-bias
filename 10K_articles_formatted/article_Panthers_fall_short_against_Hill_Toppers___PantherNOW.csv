The mens basketball team dropped a close game on Saturday against their Conference USA opponent Western Kentucky University in a  defeat PERIOD The Hilltoppers  improved to  in Conference USA while the Panthers  struggled to break free of Western Kentuckys fullcourt press the entire second half PERIOD

We didnt have the press break and they were able to turn us over a few times and get some baskets off of us or at least get possession PERIOD So thats something that were going to have to work on said Head Coach Anthony Evans PERIOD

The Panthers started the first half with more energy than they had against Marshall University PERIOD Junior forward Daviyon Draper scored the Panthers first basket and then sank a wellcontested baseline jumper a few possessions later PERIOD Draper scored  points on  shooting and notched  total rebounds over the course of the game PERIOD The defensive effort was also present for the Panthers in the first half senior guard Kris Gulley grabbed two of his teams four firsthalf steals PERIOD They also held Western Kentucky to  shooting in the first period of play PERIOD At halftime the score was tied up at  PERIOD

The second half was a different story on both sides of the floor for FIU PERIOD The Hilltoppers got some easy points off of inbounds passes and breaks to the hoop PERIOD The Panthers also were unable to break the fullcourt press that Western Kentucky had set they turned over the ball eight times in the second half PERIOD The Hilltoppers used these points off of turnovers to climb out to a  lead with  remaining PERIOD

I feel like we had the same press break in the first half and the second half PERIOD We just made mistakes in the second half that were crucial said junior forward Adrian Diaz PERIOD

The Panthers best chance at a comeback came when Western Kentucky committed a backcourt violation with  left PERIOD Diaz was fouled while shooting and made both of his free throws to cut Western Kentuckys lead to three PERIOD The forward then had to leave the game after committing his fifth foul on HarrisonDocks who made both of his free throws PERIOD Mavin ran the ball back and hit a stepback jumper to make it a threepoint game again but another foul and two more Hilltopper free throws put the game away PERIOD

FIU will hit the road to continue its conference competition by taking on Old Dominion University  on Jan PERIOD  PERIOD Tipoff is scheduled for  p.m PERIOD from Constant Convocation Center in Norfolk Virginia PERIOD
