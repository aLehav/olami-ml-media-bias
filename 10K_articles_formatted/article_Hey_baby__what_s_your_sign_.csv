Recognition of the thirteenth zodiac constellation Ophiuchus repositions most birthdays to a new zodiac and as a result many students are confused and upset PERIOD

Ophiuchus is known as the Serpent Holder. this is the newest zodiac constellation and is the only one which is linked to a real person PERIOD It is located nearby Barnards Star according to the Munich Astro Archive Constellation Pages PERIOD

The Munich Astro Archive Constellation Pages also give a brief history of the zodiac and offer an explanation as to why it changed PERIOD

When the zodiac first was invented by the Babylonians  years ago the sun just passes through the twelve constellations to which we still refer as the zodiac PERIOD Due to the precession of the Earth the apparent way of the sun through the sky has changed through the millenniums. students reacted differently to the recognition of the new zodiac sign PERIOD

Jeremy Pollack an 18yearold freshman political science major said he is confused about the new changes to the zodiac PERIOD

I dont understand why they wouldnt include it all along just because of tradition Pollack said PERIOD

The more commonly known astrological signs are the ones that adhere to tradition PERIOD The new sign throws off the regular ordering and timing of the original  PERIOD

Lisa Trope  sophomore environmental studies major said she is excited about her new sign PERIOD

Aquarius is much more interesting I never really wanted to be a fish Pisces anyways said Trope a sophomore environmental studies major PERIOD Even though I dont really know anything about Aquarius. some birthdays however still remain within the boundaries of their previous astrological signs PERIOD

Greer LovemanKrelle said her birthday Aug PERIOD  still remains in the same zodiac PERIOD

Im fine with the new zodiac constellation being recognized because Im still a Leo said LovemanKrelle a 19yearold freshman MCD biology major PERIOD

Some students are not adapting well to this new change PERIOD Susanna Horner a 19yearold freshman openoption major said she does not like it PERIOD

I feel that I have been a Sagittarius my whole life and now all of a sudden I am something different Horner said PERIOD

Horner said that it is not fair to start recognize it now if no one ever really knew about it PERIOD
