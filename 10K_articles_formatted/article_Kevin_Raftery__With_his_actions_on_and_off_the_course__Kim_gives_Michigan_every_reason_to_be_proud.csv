AUGUSTA Ga PERIOD  As I walked up to the fifth hole of the par  contest on Wednesday I heard a whisper from a nearby fan PERIOD

Who is that guy the fan asked as Michigan senior Lion Kim approached from the fourth green PERIOD The fans friend shrugged his shoulders and took a sip of beer PERIOD

No idea he responded PERIOD

But then the man noticed Kims Michigan hat and shirt PERIOD

Oh he must be a Michigan man the fan said PERIOD

It was a small moment that probably didnt mean much to the two fans but it was a moment that spoke volumes to what Kim has already accomplished  before the bright lights of the tournament even turn on PERIOD

Kim has given every Michigan graduate every Michigan fan and anyone who has ever been associated with the University a reason to be proud PERIOD Throughout the week he has conducted himself in a way that would bring any mother to tears PERIOD

In fact I hope my mom hasnt been watching for a couple reasons PERIOD One because she cries a lot PERIOD And two if she compared Kim to me she may want to adopt him and send me packing PERIOD

Any time someone has asked Kim for an autograph he has at least acknowledged the request even if he didnt have the time or permission to sign it PERIOD

As he walked up to the first tee for Wednesdays par  contest a young fan asked him for his signature PERIOD

Kim looked the boy in the eye and apologized Im sorry I have to go tee off. id say thats a pretty valid excuse as Bubba Watson and Aaron Baddeley were standing on the tee waiting for Kim to arrive PERIOD

Hes been more than willing to give an interview to any media member and hes treated me like hes known me for years always greeting me by name PERIOD

When the par  contest ended fans swarmed Kim asking for pictures and autographs PERIOD

Many media members would have tried to jump in there and get an interview when they knew they had a chance to talk with the player before he drove off and left for the day PERIOD

Instead I waited  I knew Id get my chance PERIOD I stood at the top of the hill behind the ninth green and when he emerged out of the horde of people I gave him a wave PERIOD He saw me and let me know exactly where he was going so I could talk to him PERIOD

Minutes later I met him at the range and interviewed him and he gladly answered any questions I had PERIOD

I realize Lion Kim isnt Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson PERIOD I realize theres not as many members of the media covering him as there are for the other tour players PERIOD

But I can guarantee there are only a select few players on tour who have been as accommodating as Kim PERIOD

Woods has been nowhere to be found for the most part  he didnt even play in todays par  contest PERIOD Mickelson did show his face today for the contest but other than that has been hard to find PERIOD

Dont get me wrong there are good guys on tour  Watson Baddeley KJ Choi and Zach Johnson were all more than willing to give an interview when I asked them PERIOD

And Im not suggesting that Woods and Mickelson are bad people PERIOD

But Kim realizes its a privilege to be at The Masters and his actions support that in every way PERIOD

So when you turn on ESPN or CBS to watch The Masters this weekend and you see the block M feel proud  not just because one of your own is playing at Augusta but because the man wearing the Michigan gear is representing the University in the best way possible on the biggest stage in golf PERIOD

Just do your best to hold back the tears Mom PERIOD

Raftery will be at the Masters all week PERIOD He can be reached at krafteryumich.edu PERIOD
