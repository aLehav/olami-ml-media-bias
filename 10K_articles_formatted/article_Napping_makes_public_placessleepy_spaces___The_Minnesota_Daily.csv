For years University students have engaged in the three Rs of higher education  reading riting and resting PERIOD
Sleeping on campus is a widespread phenomenon students can be caught napping in nooks and crannies nearly everywhere on campus PERIOD However some of the most popular spots for slumber tend to be in highprofile areas PERIOD
Computer science senior Sherrie Nalipinski took a short trip into dreamland on a couch Tuesday evening on the groundfloor study area in Coffman Union PERIOD
I can sleep better here than I can at home Nalipinski said PERIOD
At first she sat down to catch up on her studies but the comfortable furniture and low din of background conversation lulled her to sleep before long PERIOD
Like many college students who struggle to make ends meet outside of class Nalipinski said she works at her job until late at night PERIOD Losing sleep to earn money to pay for tuition is taxing on the body and mind Nalipinski said she needs to take cat naps here and there to catch up on muchneeded rest PERIOD
But sleeping in public is not for amateurs PERIOD The practice is fraught with dangers of both public embarrassment and theft PERIOD
One time I woke up and I was talking in my sleep really loud PERIOD People were looking at me she said PERIOD
At least I dont snore. but public spectacle might be better than having a bookbag stolen though PERIOD
University Police Sgt PERIOD Jo Anne Benson said thefts of backpacks and wallets from sleeping students is very common PERIOD She said thieves often patrol areas where its common to see students sleeping in public such as lounges and study areas PERIOD
We have career thieves and those are the areas they hang around Benson said PERIOD Its a big problem on campus. but in sleepy students minds the dangers of public sleep can vanish like words in a boring textbook PERIOD
Joel Nordell a computer science senior said he can usually be seen sleeping in Coffman two or three times per week PERIOD Although he lives near campus he said his pocketbook keeps him on campus PERIOD
Its not that long of a drive but Id have to pay twice for parking he said PERIOD
In short choppy sentences Nordell translated his groggy thoughts into sentence fragments in the Coffman lounge PERIOD He explained what he looks for when he wants to find a spot on campus to crash for a little while is primarily comfortable furniture. perhaps Nordell should compare notes with David Fujan a junior in electrical engineering PERIOD
Fujan said he is a sort of a connoisseur of sleeping in public PERIOD After having slept in many of the popular spots on campus he rated the lounge and study area on the ground floor of the Electrical Engineering building among the most comfortable PERIOD
This is one of the best he said referring to one of the buildings couches PERIOD
Unlike Fujan and Nordell electrical engineering senior Pete Anderson didnt intend to go visit the sandman Tuesday when he sat down at one of the tables in a lounge inside the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Building PERIOD
His cheeks and forehead still reddened from sleeping facedown at his study table Anderson said he fell asleep because of an early electrical engineering class in studying various power systems PERIOD A graphing calculator laid on top of a book on linear controls opened to a page in the middle that displayed various color schematics and diagrams PERIOD
It makes an excellent pillow Anderson said PERIOD
