7246,2016-04-05,"the former is Conference USAs Preseason Pitcher of the Year while the latter has been referred to as the best softball player in history PERIOD

Kylee Hanson left Joan Joyce right and the FAU softball team are looking to win their second straight conference championship in  PERIOD Ryan Lynch  Editor in Chief

Brendan Feeney Sports EditorApril  

unior pitcher Kylee Hanson and softball head coach Joan Joyce are on two opposite ends of a very similar journey PERIOD

Joyce is in her twenty-first season as head coach of the Florida Atlantic softball team following a storied career in which shes been referred to as the Babe Ruth of softball  she threw  nohitters and  perfect games PERIOD

She lost  games in her career and posted a career ERA of . pERIOD Joyce also struck out Major League Baseball Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Hank Aaron PERIOD

Meanwhile her star pitchers career is just taking off and already gaining national attention PERIOD

Hanson earned ESPNWs National Softball Player of the Week after the first weekend of the season PERIOD Prior to that Conference USA coaches voted Hanson as Conference Pitcher of the Year in the preseason PERIOD

The junior is also just one of two pitchers in the country to have at least eight wins and three saves this season  University of Texas at Arlington freshman Samantha Clakley is the only other PERIOD

Shes worked that hard and deserves that recognition Joyce said PERIOD Shes pitched extremely well so far this season PERIOD I think that probably halfway through last year when we really worked hard on being able to throw the riseball low helped her out a lot  but she works all the pitches shes gotten a little bit stronger throwing it harder and shes actually dominating hitters. the riseball  Hansons goto pitch  is a pitch that can be disguised as two separate pitches PERIOD

I have a low rise and a high rise Hanson said PERIOD My low one I want to keep between the belt and the chest and then the high one from the chest to the head PERIOD Its just changing the batters eye level trying to get them to swing and miss or get a pop up  I like my riseball a lot I get a few swings and misses on it. hansons riseball has gotten more than just a few swings and misses PERIOD As of March  she sits tenth in the nation in strikeouts and third in ERA at a mark of . pERIOD

Catching her is awesome and she always seems to be spot on so its really a pleasure sophomore catcher Alex Miller said PERIOD High school never caught for anyone like that PERIOD Travel ball never PERIOD So I was really fortunate when I came in as a freshman and was able to catch her right away and learn the game from her and learn what pitches we should call when. however Hansons biggest advantage sits in the same dugout  coach Joyce PERIOD

Its a very lucky feeling Hanson said PERIOD I dont take it for granted thats for sure PERIOD You learn a lot and you trust her  percent everything that comes out of her mouth you dont doubt. joyce and the Hanson family were connected far before Kylee thought about her college career PERIOD In fact they were connected years before she was even born PERIOD

Hansons father grew up in Connecticut and used to watch Joyce pitch for her professional team the Connecticut Falcons PERIOD Joyce believes this helped her reel in her future ace PERIOD

We had a little bit of an advantage in recruiting Hanson because her dad is from Connecticut and when he lived in Connecticut and I was playing he lived right up behind the field that we played in in the pro league PERIOD He would hop the fence and come down and watch me pitch all the time so he knew of me. that led to a unique recruiting visit according to Hanson PERIOD

I remember the first time I met Joyce because my dad was there and he used to watch her play when he was super young PERIOD So he talked a lot which was really good because it was my college visit and I was a little nervous PERIOD He talked a lot and she told a ton of stories and they were really funny and really laughable it was really comfortable  it was super cool meeting a legend. hanson wasnt the only one impacted by the visit Joyce saw something special in her future pitcher PERIOD

Hanson was a good pitcher already in high school but she was a competitor and she battled with people and thats what I liked Joyce remembers PERIOD In fact assistant coach Heather Gelbard took her on a campus tour and said to me That kid is exactly what youre looking for every single time in a pitcher. shes going to battle shes not going to give up. hansons competitive edge causes her and Joyce to butt heads every now and then PERIOD

Its just her and I going back and forth we talk a lot of softball and sometimes we have some differences of opinion that we come together on eventually Hanson said PERIOD Its funny to hear both of our sides and I never think about her side PERIOD Like her side is nothing I would instantly think of its so much more thought out than mine ever is PERIOD She just teaches me so much. joyce has taught Hanson so much in fact that now she lets the pitcher fix her own mistakes PERIOD

Right now I really dont even have to put too much focus on her unless something is going wrong Joyce said PERIOD I kind of let her just go ahead and do her thing because I dont want to put anything in her head PERIOD She knows what she has to do shes very knowledgeable about pitching. if I see something I have to say Kylee youre hanging back too far or youre getting over to your left side too much Joyce continued PERIOD I just have to say that and she knows how to take care of it  she is very very very knowledgeable. sophomore pitcher Tatum Buckley  who holds a record of   says she sits in a fortunate position where she is able to learn from both Joyce and Hanson by talking to them and watching the two work together PERIOD

Just sitting in on their bullpens and hearing what they talk about how they throw to certain batters how hard they work PERIOD Its very helpful and theyre good people to look up to Buckley said PERIOD

According to Hanson Joyce still tosses the ball sometimes with her vintage slingshot pitching motion PERIOD

She tosses every now and then and its still incredible Hanson said PERIOD Youre like When was the last time you threw to a batter  Its really good. i was ridiculous Joyce said PERIOD I was a onepitch player and I talk about that all the time PERIOD You have to take it one pitch at a time PERIOD People set goals and stuff I never set a goal in my life PERIOD I never sat and said this is gonna be my goal for the year I never did that PERIOD It was one pitch at a time and whatever that produced at the end of the game is what it was PERIOD I spent my whole life doing that just one pitch at a time and obviously it turned out pretty good. joyces athletic abilities are not limited to the softball field as she holds multiple records in different sports PERIOD

She once scored  points in one Amateur Athletic Union national basketball tournament game PERIOD

Joyce also completed a Ladies Professional Golf Association 18hole course with just  putts the best ever for a professional man or woman PERIOD Both of those records still stand today PERIOD

Joyce played on the USA Womens National Basketball Team and was a threetime Amateur Athletic Union AllAmerican PERIOD

She simultaneously played and coached volleyball for a team that competed in four national tournaments PERIOD She is one of three Americans in the International Womens Sports Hall of Fame PERIOD

Though radar guns were not used when Joyce pitched estimates say she could throw a softball in her prime equivalent to a  mph baseball in terms of reaction time PERIOD

I think the best asset I have is being able to analyze a sport and teach it Joyce continued PERIOD I just had a good head for playing the games too understanding what needs to be done. she tells a lot of funny stories about her day Hanson said PERIOD Like when Im worried about throwing to a catcher shell just tell me Dont worry about the catcher. if I tell her the umpire keeps giving me brand new balls which I hate brand new balls shell say I used to throw new balls over the backstop if I didnt want them I threw them over the backstop. she helps comfort me a lot. my relationship with coach is very good Hanson said PERIOD We are very similar so we butt heads a little bit here and there but I respect her a ton PERIOD Ive learned so much from her Ill remember everything she ever taught me for the rest of my life PERIOD Shes been really awesome. no matter how well Hanson pitches this year Conference USA coaches wont be able to sigh in relief after the season as Hanson  and the rest of FAUs pitching staff  will return for next years team PERIOD As far as her career after college goes Joyce believes she has no limits PERIOD

Its hard to say how far she can go I mean to make the Olympic team you have to be one of the top four pitchers in the country PERIOD Can Kylee be that Certainly Joyce said PERIOD Shes on track to be that good. although the U.S PERIOD has a national team softball has not been in the Olympics since  PERIOD But there has been speculation that it may return in  PERIOD

Hanson thinks theres one level she may not ever reach her coachs PERIOD

No one will ever be like her especially nowadays PERIOD No one will ever come close to Joan Joyce. brendan Feeney is the sports editor of the University Press PERIOD For information regarding this or other stories email emailprotected or tweet him feeney42 PERIOD
