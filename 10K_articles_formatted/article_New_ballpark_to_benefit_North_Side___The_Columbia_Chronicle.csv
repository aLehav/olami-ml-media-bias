Ground was broken for a North Side ballpark Oct PERIOD  that will provide area residents needed access to a playing field PERIOD

The new Kerry Wood Cubs Field located in Clark Park adjacent to Lane Tech High School  W PERIOD Addison St. has been in the planning stages for seven years according to former Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood who said he wanted to sponsor a ballpark in Chicago even though he has also played in Cleveland and New York PERIOD

None of that changed

anything Wood said of his outofstate affiliations PERIOD My family and I knew we were going to come back here and live in Chicago PERIOD Its been a long time coming but we all came together and got it done. the Chicago Cubs Charities teamed up with Wood to sponsor the new field said Chicago Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts PERIOD The diamond is projected to cost approximately  million PERIOD

Players coaches and members of the community are optimistic that the new field which is scheduled to be completed next spring will help level the playing field between city and suburban schools PERIOD

There is no doubt that athletes playing ball in the city have fewer amenities and advantages than athletes in the suburbs when it comes to fields and equipment according to Walter NolanCohn senior first baseman at Lane Tech PERIOD

He said his teams talent is equal to suburban teams but its facilities hold it back PERIOD

The monetary value in the suburbs is a lot higher than in the city NolanCohn said PERIOD We have some shortcomings with our current playing field and other places were able to practice PERIOD Its not as good as having a field to practice on every day so its going to be amazing to have a place to call home. daniel Birt a senior pitcher for Lane Tech said his team has struggled to find adequate resources PERIOD

In the past weve been playing and practicing in Horner Park Birt said PERIOD Its terrible and the equipment Horner Park provides us with is in terrible condition and mostly broken. laura Ricketts Tom Ricketts sister and director of Chicago Cubs Charities said the field will also provide benefits to Chicago Public Schools the Chicago Park District and the forty-seventh Ward PERIOD

We want the Chicago Cubs to be champions in the community just as much as we want the baseball team to bring home a World Series title Laura Rickets said PERIOD Our investment today is in the future of the student athletes who get to compete here. wood played on a high school field built by the city of Irving Texas that he claims was nicer than most AA and AAA ballparks he saw while climbing the ranks in the minor leagues PERIOD He said the quality of his high school field was a definite draw for the many fans who attended his games PERIOD

Kids were just hungry for baseball and I think we can bring that to the city again Wood said PERIOD This place will fill up and that will be great not only for this neighborhood but for the surrounding communities. chronicle TV Episode
