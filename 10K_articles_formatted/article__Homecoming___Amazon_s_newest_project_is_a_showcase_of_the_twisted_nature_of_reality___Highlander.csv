7833,2018-11-14,"amazons latest foray into original content is a surreal experience PERIOD Homecoming follows the the life of Walter Cruz a war veteran who attempts to reenter civilian life by joining the titular Homecoming project PERIOD The story is told through an ambitious production which boasts grandiose camera angles elegant shots detailed sets and Academy Award winner Julia Roberts PERIOD Released Nov PERIOD  Homecoming is a psychological thriller that will challenge viewers preconceptions coming in PERIOD

Roberts plays the role of Heidi Bergman a caseworker at the facility who earns the trust and respect of the returning soldiers PERIOD Roberts kind and welcoming smile is gigantic enough for her characters feelings to come across and maintain a reassuring demeanor to the soldiers especially after she discovers the real reason why theyre being medicated at the facility by her manipulative boss Colin Belfast Bobby Cannavale PERIOD

Homecoming shifts between the past and the present where Heidi has become a waitress and doesnt seem to remember anything related to her past occupation PERIOD Only after an investigation from the Department of Defense does Heidi start to question her perception of reality PERIOD She discovers that she is just a pawn in a larger game leading the viewer to ponder the roles that they knowingly or unknowingly play and the adverse consequences attached to them PERIOD

Although the show is paced slowly and could arguably be condensed into a twohour film patience becomes a minor hurdle when compared to the overwhelmingly positive attributes the series has to offer PERIOD Each episode is carefully constructed and layered and one can appreciate the amount of thought that went into each detail from the colors of the wall to the way a flashlight is moved in the dark PERIOD The camera encapsulates such scenic visuals that sometimes its necessary to pause observe and reflect PERIOD Even without the dialogue the storyline could easily be interpreted by following the swift camera movement and enigmatic background music that build anticipation and correlate with the intensity of the situation at hand PERIOD

If you enjoy puzzles Homecoming is filled with an abundance of symbols that are begging to be analyzed PERIOD The fact that everything is so wellwoven together comes as no surprise given that the ambitious team responsible is comprised of talented individuals who have collaborated on the sets of Kill Bill Mr PERIOD Robot and Stranger Things to name a few PERIOD

Although Roberts Cruz and Cannavale give convincing performances their acting alone isnt enough to persuade us that this may be the falls best drama PERIOD Rather its the whole combination that thrusts it to the top PERIOD If successful during awards season the storys unique formulation may serve as the standard blueprint for future shows PERIOD

Verdict Homecoming is a slow burn that requires some thought and attentive viewing every episode but if youre up for the challenge this Amazon original series will lavishly compensate you with compelling visuals among other delightful attractions PERIOD
