By Jared Farmer Staff Writer October  

The road wasnt friendly to the Illini hockey team this past weekend PERIOD
Going into last Thursdays match against Minot State the Illini held on to their No PERIOD  overall ranking in the ACHA but came out of the weekend with three straight losses to the Minot State Beavers and the Jamestown Jimmies PERIOD
Obviously we didnt want to come home with three losses especially with two going to overtime said junior forward Evan Sabo PERIOD They were all close games but I think it was a matter of capitalizing on our chances and staying disciplined throughout the games to come out with a win PERIOD We just didnt do that last weekend. in Thursdays game against Minot State an early goal attempt by Kacper Ryba was blocked midflight by the Beavers goaltender Josh Bykowski PERIOD The Illini also had a 5on3 opportunity halfway through the first but they couldnt convert it into a score PERIOD
Minot State got on the board first in the second period after a goal from Davis Sheldon and Illinois responded when Justin Ries scored his fourth goal of the season to tie the score  PERIOD Playing a 3on3 overtime period the Beavers Eric Bollefer iced the game with a goal just two minutes into the period giving the Illini their first loss of the weekend PERIOD

The Illini then headed to Jamestown for their next two games against the Jimmies PERIOD Illinois gave up the first goal of the game just  seconds after the opening faceoff PERIOD However six minutes into the second period Charley Salk would find the back of the Jimmies net to even the score  PERIOD
The Jimmies responded quickly with another goal two minutes later then the teams traded goals to finish the second period up  PERIOD The Illini picked up their next loss of the weekend after going scoreless in the third period PERIOD
The Illini went into Saturday looking to prevent the Jimmies from sweeping the series PERIOD A goal by Luke Forfar six minutes into the first period put Illinois up  but Jamestowns Dylan Hanley would respond two minutes later with a goal to tie PERIOD The two teams would again trade points in the second period which led them to overtime after going scoreless again in the third PERIOD The game almost ended up in a shootout but in the closing seconds of overtime Jamestowns Cameron Todd scored a goal to complete the sweep on Illinois PERIOD
A lot of it came down to turnovers and not running our system and playing our game Sabo said PERIOD That means moving our feet and playing hard the full sixty minutes throughout the whole game and I dont think we did that. illinois will be looking to bounce back as it returns home to play a crucial series against No PERIOD  ranked University of Central Oklahoma PERIOD The Illini remain undefeated at home going  PERIOD Central Oklahoma is  on the season and  on the road PERIOD
At this point I think just bearing down is important for us Sabo said PERIOD I know that sounds simple but really running our system not committing too many turnovers and just making sure were getting to the puck first and moving around the whole game is important PERIOD We had a few penalties in both Minot and Jamestown that put us at a disadvantage as well so as long as we stay disciplined and play our game we should be fine going into next weekend. jaredefarmer
