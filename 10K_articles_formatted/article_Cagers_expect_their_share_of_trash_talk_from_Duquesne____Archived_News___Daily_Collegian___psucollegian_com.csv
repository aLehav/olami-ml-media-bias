Dukes expected to give a tough game to the  Nittany Lions

Going from the Atlantic  to the Big Ten really hasnt phased Michael Jennings too much PERIOD

The shooting guard said that with the quality of teams in both conferences the Nittany Lions really havent missed a beat as far as the level of play goes PERIOD

One of the main differences to him is the personalities he encounters night in and night out PERIOD

 Jennings said of the oncourt verbal sparring that he faces these days in comparison to Penn States former conference PERIOD

For the Lions their  p.m PERIOD matchup with Duquesne tomorrow in Rec Hall will give them a taste of their old Atlantic  foes once again PERIOD But just as the competition hasnt skipped a beat in Jennings mind other things just dont change  especially from the talking standpoint PERIOD

 the 6foot4 senior said PERIOD 

Jennings and his teammates hope to be on the other end of the talk this time around but it wont be easy against the Dukes PERIOD

Duquesne boasts three starters averaging in doublefigures in scoring as well as a front line that includes a 7foot2 center and a 6foot11 forward PERIOD

The Lions frontcourt of center John Amaechi freshman Phil Williams and sophomore Rahsaan Carlton will have its work cut out this weekend trying to stop Duquesnes senior center Ricky Lopes and senior forward Derrick Alston PERIOD

 Coach Bruce Parkhill said PERIOD 

With Duquesnes interior size Parkhill also realizes that the Dukes will pose a specific problem for Amaechi but he expects the same from Duquesne as he does from future Lion opponents PERIOD

 Parkhill said PERIOD 

Parkhill added that his team will have to build on the effort it showed in the second half against Vermont PERIOD In that game after a sluggish first half the Lions came back from a 10point halftime deficit with a superb shooting effort from Carlton in addition to outrebounding the Catamounts  PERIOD

 Parkhill said adding that his team still needs to improve on the defensive end PERIOD 

Notes
