Though it may be difficult for most students to imagine what it feels like to have lost a son many lost a friend with the death of Jason Wren nearly a year ago PERIOD

Theres no doubt that more could have  and should have  been done the night that Jason lost his life to alcohol PERIOD But for Jasons parents to accuse  unidentified  all members of Jasons fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon as contributors to his death is not only offensive but also flagrantly callous PERIOD

Soon after he heard word of his sons death Jay Wren said he didnt blame the members of Jasons fraternity The Kansan March   PERIOD The lawsuit filed last month reflects Wrens drastic change of heart and accuses  Sigma Alpha Epsilon members of negligence contributing to Jasons death PERIOD

Such an accusation stains the lives of  individuals who arent so different from Wren in wondering what could have been done to prevent Jasons death PERIOD

Unless the Wrens accept an early settlement it could lead to a tense and emotional trial with unwarranted collateral damage PERIOD

If the case makes it before a jury the identities of the  Does will be revealed permanently engraving their names in the public record as contributors to Jasons death PERIOD The guilt they must already feel weighs heavily enough without the added stress of a trial PERIOD

Depending on the jurys verdict some or all of the Does could be responsible for paying a percentage of the requested  a minimum amount that could dramatically increase by the end of the trial PERIOD Even if the jury rules in favor of the Does the cost of lawyer fees could easily put anyone let alone a student in years of debt PERIOD

Even more disheartening is the thought of the trial itself PERIOD As defendants the  Does will defend themselves by providing the strongest cases for why theyre not at fault for Jasons death PERIOD Among the best arguments undoubtedly is to accuse Jason of causing his own death PERIOD Forcing the  Does presumably some of whom were Jasons close friends to stand trial for his death is wrong PERIOD

To avoid those unfortunate events there should be an early settlement releasing the  Does entirely from the lawsuit  before it goes to trial and before their names are released  to ensure minimum damages PERIOD

Though the Wrens efforts in bringing attention to the dangers of alcohol are commendable involving  Sigma Alpha Epsilon members appears excessive PERIOD Sparing them the embarrassment and burden of a trial is more than reasonable  its the right thing to do PERIOD

Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit no amount of monetary compensation will ever be enough to replace Jasons life PERIOD The loss of one life has been bad enough PERIOD Theres little to gain from harming the lives of others especially those who were close to Jason PERIOD
