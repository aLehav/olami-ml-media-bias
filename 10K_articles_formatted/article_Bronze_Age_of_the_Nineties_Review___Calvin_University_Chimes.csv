9298,2023-11-04,"bronze Age of the Nineties the debut album from Liance musical vehicle of senior James Li is an album about death PERIOD It is an album that claims life is a collection of interactions with death PERIOD It is an album that tells of particular deaths the death of a friends mother the death of a relationship the death of a stranger buried in a lake the death of hopefulness and naivety of youth among others PERIOD Li argues that it is not hard to find death but it is hard to find reasons to live in the midst of death PERIOD This album translates Lis experiences with death into tools for finding life PERIOD Much like light through a lens in life we pass through experiences with death and we are adjusted refracted and changed PERIOD The challenge lies in learning how to behave on the other side of the lens PERIOD

In the opening track Meg Li sings about the heartbreaking duty of consoling a close friend as she grieves for her mother PERIOD As Lis friend is mourning he meditates on the ways his own mother mourned the loss of her father PERIOD Li never met either of the deceased but his love for his friend and his mother propels him to join them in grief PERIOD This love allows him to celebrate the lives that were though he never knew them PERIOD In like manner many of these songs ponder the transient nature and fragility of life and many are much more grim and visceral PERIOD This album is a collection of gentle stories and particular experiences PERIOD These tracks are steady and humble anecdotes of pleasure mixed with pain that reach and claw for understanding PERIOD Lis writing is journalistic and verbose yet honest and nuanced PERIOD He wanders through experiences and wrestles with the implications of being overwhelmed by death yet scrounging for life PERIOD He seeks a reason to live and is willing to wait for the right reason as hard as it may be to find hope PERIOD

The track Pine Rest illuminates this struggle PERIOD Li sings I dont want to die but I want to feel alive again. li reveals a profound juxtaposition to be desperately lost perhaps by ones own refusal to consult a map and desperately calling out to be found perhaps by anything that gives some semblance of life a memory a moment a murmur of security PERIOD This harkens back to the opening track Meg in which Li sings we choose who we love but we have no choice over death or disease so hold close whos left and the rest keep in memory. while we do have some choices in life most things are out of our control PERIOD Although we are surrounded by death this should not keep us from loving it should encourage us to take advantage of whatever time we have PERIOD

Despite this focus on the frailty of life and the supposed futility of hope Li finds solace in persistence PERIOD He fights for life despite the death that surrounds him PERIOD In the song KZ Earthquake Tremor Li lists the terrible things that are happening around him he wakes up shaking and then he realizes that his whole world is shaking his friend has died in her car there are rats in his house and his plumbing doesnt work yet hell still be living there in the fall PERIOD Hes choosing to stay to live among these deaths to make the most of grim circumstances PERIOD We have no choice in death or disease but we do have a choice in how we respond to things beyond our control PERIOD

Comforting acoustic guitars angelic piano and glockenspiel and complex vocals are notable elements that carry this album PERIOD Lis voice is rarely alone on these tracks and the layers and harmonies insist that life is a journey best traveled with a friend with those who can help to sort out the complexity of human experience PERIOD The gentle piano and glockenspiel parts comfort the listener in an unspeakable way that illustrates that sometimes words are inadequate PERIOD

Though Lis voice may sound uneasy and afraid at times  it may even sound defeated  the act of telling these stories is important PERIOD The act of giving a voice to his experiences can help validate the experiences of the speaker and allow him to make sense of things that are complex and frightening PERIOD Listening to this album will provide an opportunity to hear a friend struggle to sort through a handful of experiences and observations about difficulty and death PERIOD If you allow yourself to grieve with him and listen to the struggle you may find fresh reasons to live PERIOD
