A crowd of Pitt students jammed the stairway leading up to Towers Patio on Monday waving rainbow flags and sporting I heart the female orgasm tshirts PERIOD

Others stood on nearby trashcans and benches and leaned over the patio rails fervently chanting God loves everyone and shame on you. the chants by the more than  Pitt students were all directed to a smaller crowd teetering on the edge of the sidewalk clutching signs reading homos go to hell and chanting  before the counter protesters drowned them out  God hates you. the protesters carried signs saying they were part of the Philadelphiabased Christian Interviews. on largest sign was the website christianinterviews.com a site that does not exist PERIOD They arrived on Towers Patio around  p.m according to Kaleigh Bradley the communications manager for Rainbow Alliance  Pitts LGBTQ advocacy group PERIOD

I was outside with a friend and saw them and was like whats going on she said PERIOD



Bradley said Pitt police arrived around  p.m PERIOD and arrested one man involved in the protest PERIOD Pitt spokesperson Joseph Miksch confirmed the arrest adding that Pitt police charged the man with defiant trespassing PERIOD

Following the arrest the small group made their way down the Towers patio stairs to the sidewalk  an area considered public domain PERIOD Along with other students Bradley followed them down  brandishing her hastily made I love vagina sign PERIOD

After seeing on Snapchat that a few counterprotesters had gathered to drown out the racist and homophobic chants firstyear student Mia Shikora joined the students gathered by Towers PERIOD Standing on a bench she chanted Love wins and joined other students in singing the national anthem PERIOD

These people were chanting all kinds of racist and homophobic stuff and were just trying to respond with positive things Shikora said PERIOD

Thomas Stroukoff a firstyear neuroscience major said the crowd got progressively larger as the counterprotest went on and more students joined to express their disapproval PERIOD

I think for the most part everyone is pretty much in agreement that this is kind of a notokay situation to have on our campus he said PERIOD

Miksch said in a statement that free speech and peaceful exchange of differing viewpoints are among the core values of the University PERIOD

Events such as todays are a reminder that even when tempers flare and when hateful speech comes to our campus we can eschew violence and continue to carry the banner of our commitment to diversity and inclusion on our campus and in the world Miksch said PERIOD

Stroukoff said he felt the protestors and their cause were absolutely idiotic. pitt students shout at people holding signs reading  and  outside Towers on Fifth PERIOD pic.twitter.comZKzKBCfPes

Honestly I wouldnt take it too seriously because theyre idiots he said PERIOD I have not seen a single person that is not pissed off by this. miksch also said the University did not sanction nor issue a permit for the protesters to be on Towers Patio PERIOD According to Chief of Pitt Police Jim Loftus the police had no idea how this protest was going to occur describing it as a popup thing. we came out here in case there was a safety issue to make sure nobody got hurt like pushed in front of a bus Loftus said PERIOD

No injuries were reported as Pitt students mobilized to publicly share their discontent with the protesters PERIOD Jeremy ReoNason an undeclared firstyear student said he believed the counterprotest reflected well on Pitt students PERIOD

Some of the language wasnt exactly clean but you cant expect it to be PERIOD It isnt with any protest he said PERIOD But I mean there wasnt any violence there werent any threats  it was handled well. loftus said he was both surprised and pleased by how the counterprotest played out PERIOD

Students did a great job he said PERIOD They came forward they were vocal not too confrontational PERIOD Best we couldve expected. bradley said Loftus was responsible for getting the protesters to leave PERIOD

Loftus got the people out told them to cross the street she said PERIOD I went up to him afterwards and thanked him for keeping people safe. reoNason said the counterprotest reflected Pitts emphasis on respecting diversity and being inclusive PERIOD He said the takeaway was that people at Pitt dont have to hide if they disagree with something PERIOD

A lot of people showed up just to tell these people off to get them out of there PERIOD The protesters were against diversity and inclusion and Pitt students came out and told them otherwise he said PERIOD

Loftus shook hands with the counterprotesters as they dispersed PERIOD

You did a great job he told them PERIOD Drowned those guys out. created by our advertising software OpenX PERIOD
