Enter the mens swimming and diving team PERIOD

Sure theyll get some time off for the holidays but they arent as talented as they are for no reason PERIOD Head coach Brad Bowser expects the Profs to be stronger than they are now once they head back to competition in January PERIOD

We give them practices for their specific groups Bowser said PERIOD We give a weight program that the strength and conditioning writes out. the Brown and Gold will start winter break with two weeks at home until they head back to school to continue their training PERIOD Sophomore Kevin Gilloolys training plans over break are simple PERIOD

Keep grinding and spend some good time with my family Gillooly said PERIOD

The second year Prof had certainly made a splash this season especially after a recordbreaking performance at the WPI Invitational PERIOD He feels confident saying a national title was a goal for him by his senior year but it now seems to be a realistic goal just in his sophomore campaign PERIOD Theres still work to do to get to where others in the country are though PERIOD

Right now what I lack compared to some of the other swimmers in the country is the muscle and the strength Gillooly said PERIOD So I want to definitely bulk up over the break. while the rest of us are going to be packing on the Christmas calories over break Bowser knows the discipline required to build an elite unit and that is discipline not only in the water but also with their diet PERIOD

These guys know when they come back if theyre not in shape theyre going to pay for it Bowser said PERIOD

While they have to be disciplined the break is still a good time for the team to unwind from the everyday stress that the season brings with it PERIOD

It was kind of rough getting back from the meet just trying to recover and kind of get my feet back under me but definitely feel a lot better now Gillooly said PERIOD Im ready to get back at it. bowser also sees it as an important time for the team to just focus on swimming and improving their craft PERIOD

Its a time to decompress from the everyday school work and the everyday grind of having to worry about what test they have or what paper is due next week Bowser said PERIOD Were together from Jan PERIOD  to Jan PERIOD  with no school whatsoever which is nice PERIOD We see a lot of bonding during that time PERIOD We see the team come together PERIOD We work together as a whole and its really nice to see. after only a few days back the team will pack their bags and head to sunny Florida where theyll be staying together for a week in a beachfront hotel PERIOD This is not your grandparents winter trip to Florida to escape the cold however as theyll be in a rigorous training program while theyre there PERIOD

That week is going to be a really tough week for us as a team because were going to be practicing twice a day have a lot of really tough practices Gillooly said PERIOD But that week kind of sets the rest of the season up and brings us together as a team to accomplish some really tough things and that way we know that when it comes March or when it comes February weve already done so much training together that we know we can accomplish anything. for commentsquestions about this story email sportsthewhitonline.com or tweetTheWhitOnline PERIOD
