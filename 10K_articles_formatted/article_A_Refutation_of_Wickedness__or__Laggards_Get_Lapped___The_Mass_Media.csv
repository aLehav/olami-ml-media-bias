Dan RocheNovember  

Every so often someone will come sweating up to me and say Dan Ive got this great idea for a column wherefrom they outline said great idea and I tells em Heres my email address PERIOD Write about it and get back to me. and I never hear from them again PERIOD

This time was different PERIOD A friend suggested I write about lazy unmotivated students PERIOD I agreed they were a problem the nattering cell phone jockeys nappers and gumcrackers sucking the air out of every introlevel class PERIOD It was something Id thought of writing about before PERIOD I took on the challenge PERIOD

If you are a motivated student read no further PERIOD If you care about your education and are considerate of others who are likewise put this paper down now PERIOD We are cool PERIOD

If you are one of those lazy stupid slobs who talk over the professor and assume that last nights episode of Lost is more important than the discipline I am the avenger of those who have had eyes rolled at them but carry on of every student who has to drown out background noise to get the nights assignment you cellphone chatterers and gum crackers you natterers and nappers sarcastic simpletons and blatherskites infected with cerebral trypanosomiasis PERIOD I despise your parents You who take the majors with the fewest credits because they are just that who pollute the noosphere and are not here to learn but for the diploma only I wish pestilence upon your Quincy subdivisions PERIOD Banal oafs I am come for you PERIOD Choose your weapon PERIOD Scabbard or halberd let it be no sharper than thee

We who work jobs to attend school only to sit through class after class of gossipers Conniving blockheads Vapid young vixens and their subnormal suitors conspiring to steal time PERIOD You ruminants who Irish whisper Uhhhhh this class sucks  you injure America with your apathy PERIOD If you are our future we are doomed You are ignorants Slovenly no matter how you shower

Those from Harvard from Princeton from Yale the learned From Barbados and Britain China and Chile they travel here to be trod upon by local parochial oxen such as you can find sleeping on any job at City Hall or polluting any 7Eleven parking lot in this poor setupon assembly of States with chatter of sports betting or sofa beds or whatever the vain hunchbacks and eyesores in eyeliner guhhuhhuhhuh about PERIOD Terrible is lamentation when these toadstompers triumph when not one has done the tenpage reading when oafs with aerated crania are legion and the room is full of the vapid PERIOD

But fearful forlorn are flunkers in the finals week When no dull thrust goes unparried PERIOD You awake alert earnest you braves stouts will you continue to be the yoke of your lessers You who study with me you are my brothers PERIOD Let us fight in valor at least if die we must and let us forever steer the classroom conversation back home PERIOD Home to what the professor was talking about PERIOD

Then let it be known that Finals week is our time and forever more when men remember the Finals they will remember us PERIOD



OK thats it for bombast PERIOD Lets get to other stuff PERIOD Our friendly neighborhood webmaster John Mazzarella sez I was thinking uh oh about the library smokers porch PERIOD Now that its open again people are back out there smoking but at the same time theres signs up all over it saying No smoking. its just funny that its been open for only a few days and the floor out there which was clean on Friday is now covered in butts just like usual and maybe the school should rethink the smoking policy for that area and put in a cigarette butt trash thing for the people afraid to throw lit cigarettes in a regular trash can. james the custodian was overheard talking about the issue saying I think I didnt quite get everything that either an ash can should be put out and the sign taken down or the school should get down to enforcing the no smoking policy PERIOD I might have misheard him but its a legitimate point PERIOD An ash can is the obvious choice unless youre going to have a police officer detail which is a waste of time and money for people to say smoke at the foot of the steps instead PERIOD Where they would one assumes leave their butts PERIOD Unless youre going to pay to have someone hang out under there too PERIOD

This weeks letter to the editor by Chan and Forbes highlights a matter of interest PERIOD In a school of  souls is there one cafeteria The people who man the conveyors at the entre kiosk with the . wednesday specials have to be among the hardest working people on staffOops I forgot theyre not on staff theyre Sodexho PERIOD Well then work them to the bone eh Sodexho is a mixed bag PERIOD Yes yes I understand PERIOD Big multinational company PERIOD But the food isnt total crap PERIOD Some of their labor policies might be bad some of their business practices might be badI understand that too PERIOD Are they so reprehensible though that their function as a provider of reasonably priced reasonably highquality food is to be disregarded The assumptions are that their food is passable which I feel it is and that other providers would pose similar problems which I feel they would PERIOD This does not mean that I think Sodexho is the best of all possible providers but what are better alternatives Discuss
