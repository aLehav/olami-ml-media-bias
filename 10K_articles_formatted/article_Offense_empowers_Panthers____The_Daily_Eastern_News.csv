They say defense wins championships PERIOD



But as a fan I dont get anything out of a championship  sports are only entertainment and I want to witness monster home runs stolen bases and  final scores PERIOD

Enter the Eastern baseball team PERIOD

The Panthers lineup is chock full of mashers with just enough speedsters sprinkled in to make it interesting PERIOD

While the team is actually very talented in the field and defends well its all about the offense this season for head coach Jimmy Schmitzs squad PERIOD

From leadoff hitter Brett Nommensen and fellow speedster Casey Spears swiping bases to the fearsome threesome of Erik Huber Ryan Campbell and Kory Peppenhorst driving in runs this Eastern team is fun to watch PERIOD

Huber leads the team with six home runs and a . batting average Campbell has hit six doubles in addition to six RBIs and Peppenhorst a freshman catcher has impressed with  RBIs and a . batting average in just his second semester in Charleston PERIOD

This season Schmitz decided to let assistant coach Sean Lyons take care of all the hitting instruction so he could focus on the pitching PERIOD Lyons has given Schmitz no regrets PERIOD

So far this season the Panthers are hitting . as a team with  RBIs in only  games PERIOD Thats more than five runs per game PERIOD

At the band box that is Coaches Stadium the Panthers are hitting even better than their outrageous season averages with seven runs per game in their first five home games PERIOD

Eastern pitchers have been shaky sometimes this season especially in the bullpen but with that offense the team can survive some struggles on the mound PERIOD

After a brief four game road trip Eastern will return home next Tuesday to play six games in a nineday stretch PERIOD

The offensive explosion should continue with some poor pitching teams coming to Charleston for the homestand PERIOD

Murray State is the only Ohio Valley Conference team the Panthers will play next week and the Racers bring with them a  record and a team ERA of . pERIOD A whopping  opponents have crossed the plate in Murrays  games this season PERIOD Ouch PERIOD

Eastern might have to buy a couple extra buckets of balls for those three games  more than a couple are going to end up in fans hands PERIOD

There is nothing better than catching a ball game in the summer with a hot dog in one hand and a cold beer in the other PERIOD

You can certainly get a hot dog but they dont serve drinks at Easterns ballpark and it is probably a good thing PERIOD

Everyone would spill them jumping out of the blue plastic seats after yet another Eastern run is scored PERIOD

Let the defense take the Panthers to the top of the OVC PERIOD Ill be there for the home runs  and maybe the hot dogs PERIOD
