Northern Illinois Universitys student news organization since 

Ensure student journalism survives PERIOD Donate today PERIOD

September  

Thank you NIU faculty staff students and local residents who pitchedin to the relief attempt on campus PERIOD

During the first three days of NIUs Hurricane Katrina fundraiser  was raised to aid victims of the most violent natural disaster in Americas history PERIOD

Some people gave spare change while others wrote checks for literally hundreds PERIOD Some offered clothing and supplies such as sleeping bags and blankets PERIOD

All this with Friday remaining to cap off the week PERIOD

But then again shame on you NIU faculty staff students and local residents who could not spare a buck PERIOD

During the first three days of NIUs Hurricane Katrina relief fundraiser only  was raised to aid victims of the most violent natural disaster in Americas history PERIOD

Thats right a total of  was donated at  locations by a student body of roughly  people PERIOD

If each student gave  the amount equal to a bag of chips from a vending machine or a trip through the tollbooth on Annie Glidden Road the sum would be  from students alone  more than seven times the amount donated PERIOD

As it stands and in fear of sounding eerily similar to Sally Struthers the breakdown equals  cents per student PERIOD

If the hundreds of faculty and staff members are factored into that total the average per NIU patron is even less PERIOD

What makes the low turnout so frustrating is the amount of bleedingheart lipservice uttered in classrooms and on the streets PERIOD People regale one another with tales about tragic CNN images who when asked if they donated utter I havent had a chance to yet. oh really Because the locations are far out of your way Because it takes so much work to scrounge up change from your couch cushions Or because talking about the tragedy is just easier than doing something about it

But then again this is just our  cents PERIOD It pails in comparison to the  you all chipped in PERIOD
