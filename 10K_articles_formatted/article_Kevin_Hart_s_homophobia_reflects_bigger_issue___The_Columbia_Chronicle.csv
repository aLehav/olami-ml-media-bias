Standup comedian Kevin Hart has played many roles but there is one role he claims he will never play a gay man PERIOD
Hart has gained a strong fan base that seems to support most of his career ventures with his appearances in popular films and several TV shows but in a recent interview with The Breakfast Club on Power . hart said he will never play a gay characterand even turned down one such role in 2008s blockbuster hit Tropic Thunder because he is insecure about what people would think of him PERIOD
I dont think Im really going to dive into that role  percent because of the insecurities about myself trying to play that part Hart said PERIOD What I think people are going to think while Im trying todo this is going to stop me. plenty of other straight actors have played the roles of gay men in their careers and Harts refusal to do so only makes him appear homophobic and hypocritical PERIOD
In his films Hart has played many roles that could hardly be deemed appropriate if they accurately represented his reallife behavior PERIOD In one of his most popular films Think Like a Man Hart plays a happily divorced womanizer quick to hit on any woman he sees PERIOD A more recent example would be Harts role in The Wedding Ringer in which he plays a condescending wedding planner whose methods are inconsiderate and impractical PERIOD
In his standup act Hart enthusiastically tells personal stories that do not paint the best picture of him PERIOD For instance he has no reservations telling personal anecdotes of getting drunk at bars and starting fights PERIOD Why is it that Hart is more comfortable playing reprehensible characters or telling stories that actually portray him in a bad light unconcerned about what people may think of him but when it comes to simply playing a gay male he feels insecure It gives the impression that Hart believes that being gay is worse than being a bad person. it is also concerning that people would rather see Hart as morally bankrupt than as a gay man PERIOD Harts irrational fears of the repercussions of playing a gay character only highlight a larger societal issue Some people are too judgmental and quick to label actors based on their roles PERIOD Just because somebody plays a gay character does not mean they are gay PERIOD Unlike children most adults in the audience should understand that actors are playing roles of fictional people that do not coincide with their personal lives PERIOD
Yes Harts comments do come across as homophobic but his fear could be the result of the film industrys problematic history of straight actors being shamed for playing characters of a different sexual orientation PERIOD
One major example of this is the flurry of rumors that surrounded Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledgers individual sexualities following the  release of Brokeback Mountain. it has been nearly a decade since the films release and more recent releases show that the issue is just as prevalent today PERIOD Very little progress has been made PERIOD
More recently Nick Jonas sexuality has been called into question since Kingdom the TV show in which he stars recently revealed his character is gay and showed a gay sex scene involving the actor PERIOD Despite this public reaction Jonas has stuck by his decision to play the character and in a Dec PERIOD  interview with BuzzFeed said he was proud to play a gay character and regretted nothing PERIOD
Similar to Jonas there are many other straight actors who would not think twice before playing a gay role and actually take pride in doing so unlike Hart PERIOD
During the Jan PERIOD  premiere of James White at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City Utah rapper and actor Kid Cudiwho plays a gay man in the filmtold Billboard he did not even hesitate to accept the role PERIOD
I knew I had a responsibility Cudi said PERIOD Theres going to be some kid thats going to see me in this film and maybe have the confidence to come out PERIOD Im comfortable with myself as a man. it is important that we have straight actors filling the roles of gay characters PERIOD It demonstrates a growing support for the LGBTQ community and can help people struggling with their sexual identities to realize that they have allies PERIOD Gay roles should not be exclusive to gay actors PERIOD
To solve this issue there need to be more actors like Jonas and Cudi who are not afraid to take on gay roles because of how people might interpret them PERIOD The more often straight actors embrace and portray gay roles the more accepted the idea will become PERIOD Straight actors would receive much less backlash for playing gay characters and maybe people like Hart would be less reluctant to play gay characters PERIOD
