I have been called callous insensitive and apathetic and with good reason I often find myself struggling to understand the motivations of others PERIOD I do not on a general level understand what the big deal is or the small deal or really what the deal is at all PERIOD Ignorance not being my most glorious quality I set about to remedy this situation and possibly help out some other confused individuals in the process PERIOD

So for people like me heres a quick guide Caring for the uninitiated

Occasionally people will get emotional when arguing or speaking with you and will from that point forward cease employing higherorder rational thought processes PERIOD This phenomena manifests in discussions about petty and trivial subjects as well as subjects that actually matter PERIOD

The reason for these emotionally emphatic utterances is that the world is in  To explain myself and many of you  my dear readers  are bestowed with less  while others were given an overabundance PERIOD This overabundance of Caring overwhelms many people causing them to  for things and making it impossible for them to interact with you in any cogent fashion PERIOD This is not your fault but neither is it theirs as there is simply a disconnect in communicative patterns PERIOD

The first step to dealing with someone who cares excessively is to identify that they do in fact care about something so much that they render themselves incompetent PERIOD

When this classification has been made you may approach the rest of your interaction with them in several ways the most convenient of which is to agree with them as it will typically studies show inflict upon them brevity  and brevity my dear caring readers is the only real goal for the Caringless PERIOD

The greatest principle you can remember as you endeavor to set along the path to Caring is that while you may eventually feel the twinges of passion you should reject these sensations PERIOD These bizarre feelings affirm that you are beginning to care about something PERIOD

Remember however that in order to maintain the Caring Equilibrium in the world these feelings should be discouraged PERIOD

You will falter and fail on occasion as you come to find that caring about certain subjects is enjoyable and at times an attractive quality to the opposite sex which you may find yourself caring to impress PERIOD

Though you may not truly understand why you must fight this good fight you must invest in my words and pursue the apathetic life granted you PERIOD That I should care enough to levy this advice is the obvious err of my humanity and the request that you care enough to heed my advice dear readers is one terribly ironic conundrum PERIOD
