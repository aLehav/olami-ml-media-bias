The fate of  state measures have been decided by California voters PERIOD

By Marcos Franco Cassandra Nava and Aimee Martinez

Californians voted on  propositions leading up to the Nov PERIOD  election that covered important issues like voting for parolees expanding privacy laws and keeping rideshare drivers as independent contractors PERIOD Here are the most recent results of six ballot measures pertinent to students PERIOD

Proposition  a ballot measure that would have repealed the ban on affirmative action failed to pass with . percent of Californians voting no PERIOD The section of the California Constitution that prohibits considering diversity in hiring and educational enrollment will stay the same PERIOD This is the second time since  that Californian voters have rejected affirmative action PERIOD It was only passed in five bay area counties and Los Angeles PERIOD California is currently one of nine states that bans affirmative action PERIOD

The bill was originally proposed by Assemblywoman Shirley Weber earlier this year in the hopes that the increased political interest the pandemic and deaths by police would help reverse Proposition  which banned affirmative action in  PERIOD According to Yes on  this proposal would have been a step toward deconstructing systematic racism and sexism PERIOD The website also states that since the ban the admission rate at UC campuses for Latino and black students has decreased by  percent and the measure would have helped level the disparity PERIOD

In an article by the San Francisco Chronicle some supporters suggested that voters may not have supported the measure because they were confused about it such as believing it would implement quotas and discriminate against Asian American students PERIOD On the Californians for Equal Rights website opponents stated this was not the case and cited some polls taken over the years to emphasize how public opinion on the subject has remained consistent PERIOD Among them was a  Gallup poll that asked whether students should be accepted into higher education on the basis of merit even if it meant fewer minorities or if race should be considered to increase diversity even if those students would not normally be considered PERIOD Seventy percent responded in favor of merit PERIOD

Proposition  which restores the right to vote for parolees was passed with . percent of the votes PERIOD According to the San Francisco Chronicle it will allow  former prisoners to vote while on parole PERIOD Until now the California Constitution prohibited people convicted of felonies from voting until their sentence and parole were completed though it did allow those on probation to vote PERIOD Nineteen other states currently allow parolees convicted of felonies to vote according to Ballotpedia PERIOD

Annual county costs will be increased to pay for more voter registration and ballot materials as a result PERIOD State Assemblyman Kevin McCarty a supporter argued that parole was meant to integrate prisoners back on to the community not to be a punishment PERIOD Others argue that voting helps them to do just that reenter society PERIOD

Proposition  which would have enacted rent control in California was not passed in the Nov PERIOD  election PERIOD Ballotpedia displays that  percent of voters voted no on the proposition PERIOD This has not been the first ballot measure to address housing issues and voters rejected the similar Proposition  in  PERIOD

Proposition  would not have changed any rent control laws in place but would have allowed cities and counties to pass their own measures PERIOD Although it was rejected tenants are still protected under Assembly Bill  which was signed by Gov PERIOD Gavin Newsom last year PERIOD This bill caps annual rent increases at  percent plus inflation in most rental housing more than  years old PERIOD

Since Proposition  did not pass this means that the states ban of certain forms of rent control will stay in effect PERIOD

California voters have given rideshare companies such as Uber and Lyft the green light to continue hiring drivers as independent contractors rather than employees PERIOD Proposition  which grants an exemption to tech companies from a state labor law requiring them to provide drivers basic employee protections and benefits was carried to a victory last week PERIOD With all votes having been accounted for Prop PERIOD  has passed with a  percent approval rate from voters PERIOD

Prop PERIOD  has stood out on the ballot since rideshare companies have spent over  million advertising in support of the proposition making it the most expensive state measure in history PERIOD The approval has given appbased drivers the go ahead to continue operating without interruption PERIOD Supporters of Prop PERIOD  claim that with its passing drivers can continue to earn money as they please without having a designated work schedule PERIOD Opponents claim that the tech giants have found a sneaky loophole to conduct business in California without fully abiding to state labor laws PERIOD

Since passing Ubers stock price has increased  percent as well as an  percent increase from Lyft PERIOD With the approval of the measure users will continue requesting rides and commuting as they did prior to the proposition PERIOD

Voters in California voted in favor of Proposition  PERIOD The measure that seeked to expand the states consumer data privacy laws passed with  percent of the vote on Election Day PERIOD Loopholes created by the  California Consumer Privacy Act will be closed with Proposition 24s California Privacy Rights Act PERIOD

Data privacy and concerns are a growing issue and are especially popular locally PERIOD Proposition  aims to limit businesses from using personal data triple the fine for violating childrens privacy rights and create a new agency that will enforce these rules and privacy laws PERIOD According to Fortune consumers will now be able to ask businesses to not share their personal data which is a customary practice in online advertising and marketing PERIOD Consumers will also be able to ask businesses to stop hoarding personal information for longer than necessary PERIOD

The state agency in charge of enforcing these new privacy rules will go into effect starting in  PERIOD

California voters rejected Proposition  which would have kept Senate Bill   a legislature to replace cash bail with risk assessment for detained criminal suspects PERIOD With . percent voting no SB  is repealed and the cash bail system remains PERIOD According to Ballotpedia the assessment would have categorized suspects as low medium and high risk PERIOD Those deemed low risk would have been released from jail until the trial PERIOD The goal of supporters was to create a safer less expensive system so that a rich person accused of a serious crime could not be released simply because they could afford it PERIOD But opponents argued that a computer algorithm would replace judges and be racially biased PERIOD

Results are considered unofficial until certified on Dec PERIOD  PERIOD Until then Californians can expect propositions to go into effect the fifth day after the secretary of state certifies election results PERIOD Some changes voters will see are parolees right to vote and strengthened online privacy rights PERIOD
