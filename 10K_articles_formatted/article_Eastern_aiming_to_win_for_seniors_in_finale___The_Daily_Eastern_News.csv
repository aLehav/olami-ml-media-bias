JJ Bullock EditorInChiefNovember  

Things did not go how the Eastern football team   OVC wanted them to go in head coach Adam Cushings first season at the helm of the program PERIOD

The Panthers of course would have liked more things to go their way during the season perhaps one less turnover against Indiana State one less fumble against Murray State one more stop against Jacksonville State PERIOD Yes looking back on a season one game from completion and one might find plenty that the Panthers could dwell on PERIOD

But Eastern is not dwelling on anything as it heads into its final game against the OVCs firstplace team Austin Peay   OVC on Saturday PERIOD The Panthers want to win on Saturday and they want to do it for the senior class whose final season was far from storybook PERIOD

Cushing said what he wants to see from his team is a full effort for the graduating class PERIOD

I really just think its our guys best effort consistently for the seniors this group of seniors Cushing said PERIOD I said earlier in the week and I probably said it on Saturday after the last game This group of seniors was thrown a huge curveball in what they were hoping was going to be their best and their last season and their reaction to it has really been phenomenal. saturday no matter the outcome will be the final chapter in the senior Panthers careers at Eastern PERIOD There will be no postseason no more practice no more team meetings no more mandatory workouts PERIOD

Cushing said the team is obviously aware this will be the last game of their careers but said he is not quite certain it has totally sunk in with the seniors that this is really it PERIOD

Males especially dont do a great job of processing sometimes you know when those emotions are on their way Cushing said PERIOD But we have been talking about it and I have been saying to the seniors they just need to trust me that every minute of this week will be etched in their mind forever every detail every time that they step between the white lines every time that theyre playing catch with their buddies. cushing added

I dont think the team has really processed that this group of guys isnt going to be there next time we meet as a team that that group of seniors isnt going to be sitting in their appropriate seats in the team room he said PERIOD

But there is a game coming on Saturday and the finale of Easterns season just happens to come against the conferences best team that with a win could clinch an OVC championship Austin Peay PERIOD

Austin Peay is really good at running the ball and defending the run I think they are the best in the country at defending the run Cushing said PERIOD And man they have done a phenomenal job coach came in and had a great idea of what his system was going to be and you know quite frankly had a lot of good football players that have bought in. austin Peay leads the conference in points per game . and is second in points allowed . pERIOD The Governors are the second lead team in rushing in the OVC and by far the best team at stopping the run allowing just . rushing yards per game PERIOD

The team Eastern will play on Saturday could be the Panthers toughest test since week two when they played Indiana on the road PERIOD

But none of that seems to matter right now for the Panthers they are focused on themselves and focused on beating whomever stands in their way of sending off their graduating class in the way they feel is deserved PERIOD

Eastern and Austin Peay kick off at  p.m PERIOD in Clarksville Tennessee PERIOD
