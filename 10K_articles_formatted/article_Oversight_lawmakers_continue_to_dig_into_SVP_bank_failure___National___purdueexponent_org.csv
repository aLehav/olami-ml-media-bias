The Center Square  The House Oversight lawmakers tasked with finding out why Silicon Valley Bank failed earlier this year and threatened the health of the entire economy are pushing deeper in their investigation PERIOD

The investigation continues after lawmakers said earlier this year there is evidence that the San Francisco Federal Reserve Board knew of Silicon Valley Banks woes since  but did little about it PERIOD

SF Fed appears to have failed to adequately supervise SVB and respond to the banks mismanagement ultimately leading to SVBs seizure by federal regulators  the second largest bank failure in U.S PERIOD history  and threatening a panic in our banking system House Oversight Republicans led by Chairman James Comer RKy. said in a letter to to the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco earlier this year PERIOD

House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer RKy. and Subcommittee on Health Care and Financial Services Chairwoman Lisa McClain RMich. sent a letter to the SF Fed on Monday demanding more information arguing the board has not adequately responded to information requests PERIOD

Due to our concerns with the inadequacy of the SF Feds response on May   Committee staff held a call with SF Fed staff the letter said PERIOD During that call the SF Fed informed Committee staff that upon receipt of our letter the SF Fed immediately contacted your staff who informed them that the Fed Board was asserting privilege over a majority of the requested materials as confidential supervisory information CSI and that the SF Fed would not be able to provide any more information to the Committee. the lawmakers say the SF Fed later agreed to hand over nonpublic documents but has since not been responsive to the committees requests PERIOD
