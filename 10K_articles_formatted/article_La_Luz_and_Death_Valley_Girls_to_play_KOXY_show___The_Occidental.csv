KOXYs fourth event of the  school year on Feb PERIOD  will feature performances by Seattlebased band La Luz and Burger Records Death Valley Girls PERIOD By specifically showcasing the talents of women this event which will take place at Mullen Grove will advance KOXYs effort to book artists from different backgrounds experiences and genres PERIOD

Last semester KOXY held three shows  the first a performance by Stones Throw producer MNDSGN and Open Mike Eagle of Hellfyre Club PERIOD According to Events Manager Madison Rudd junior students most commonly voice interest in appearances from hiphop artists rappers and producers PERIOD These shows usually attract the largest turnouts exemplified by the stations packed performance from Mykki Blanco last spring PERIOD

The second show of the fall semester was held at Eagle Rocks All Star Lanes PERIOD Two of the performing acts Benjamin Franklin and his Naughty Interest in Electricity and NRH included Occidental students and recent graduates respectively PERIOD The third performance was centered around the Cumbia genre with a headlining performance from Viento Callejero and catering from Portos PERIOD

KOXYs events staff plans to host another three events this spring all thematically independent from one another PERIOD Between both of the bands performing Feb PERIOD  seven of the eight musicians are women PERIOD The exception is Death Valley Girls guitarist Larry Schemel PERIOD Schemel is the brother and collaborator of Patty Schemel former drummer of seminal 90s punk band Hole and current member of Upset PERIOD

Formed in  La Luz is composed of Shana Cleveland guitar Marian Li Pino drums Alice Sandahl keyboard and Lina Simon bass all members contribute vocals PERIOD The band released its debut album Its Alive in  after signing to SubPop affiliate Hardly Art PERIOD 2015s Weirdo Shrine  fittingly recorded in a defunct surfboard factory  combines foreboding lyrics with surfrock riffs that recall The Ventures of Hawaii Five0 theme song fame PERIOD

Its just something different basically than what people are used to within rock genres specifically Rudd said PERIOD

La Luzs distinct sound and recent relocation from Seattle to Los Angeles made them an ideal booking choice for KOXY PERIOD Their performance will follow that of Death Valley Girls comprised of Bonnie Bloomgarden lead vocals Laura Kelsey drums Jessie Jones bass and Schemel PERIOD The garagerock group has appeared on various local stages from The Smell in Downtown LA to the Natural History Museum and is set to travel to Austin for South by Southwest in March PERIOD

KOXYs Feb PERIOD  show will not be the first time these bands have played together in LA they performed alongside Wand at The Echo in October  PERIOD Both groups will also appear at the Burger x Observatory 5year anniversary festival in Fullerton March  PERIOD

The concept of an allfemale show is not foreign to La Luz PERIOD Its label represents a number of other femalefronted artists including Chastity Belt Tacocat Colleen Green and La Sera PERIOD Cleveland recognizes that female musicians are best represented when bookers consider the artists sounds in addition to their genders when organizing shows PERIOD

I think promoters have a tendency to group female bands together which can sometimes feel shortsighted if the musical styles dont make sense together Cleveland said via email PERIOD That said wed all like to see more representation of women in music and I think thats happening more and more PERIOD We like playing with bands that are really good and if there are other ladies involved thats a bonus. death Valley Girls is set to take the stage at  p.m. with La Luz performing at  p.m PERIOD KOXY will provide empanadas from Portos Bakery sell newly designed Tshirts and offer free KOXY stickers temporary tattoos and bottle openers PERIOD The event is free for students and the first  nonOccidental students who filled out the RSVP form online that cap was met less than a week after the show was announced on social media PERIOD KOXY Events Assistant Myka Kielbon sophomore hopes this outside attendance will help to bridge a gap between the station and artistic activity developing offcampus PERIOD

KOXY is so small and Occidental is so small Kielbon said PERIOD I think as a student service we have to serve more as a link to the outside community. in light of these conversations the KOXY staff continues to focus on providing students with creative opportunities and outlets PERIOD As the organization attempts to garner diverse programming inside and outside of the DJ booth Rudd emphasizes the importance of student feedback to broaden attendance and satisfy all corners of the campus PERIOD

Were a student service Rudd said PERIOD Its about bringing things that students want to campus so if theyre interested in something I want to hear that. this article has been archived for more requests please contact us via the support system PERIOD
