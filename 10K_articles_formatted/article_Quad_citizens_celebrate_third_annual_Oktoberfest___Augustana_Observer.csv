On Saturday Oct PERIOD  the Hauberg Estate and the German American Heritage Center and Museum GAHC came together to host their third annual Oktoberfest Quad Cities PERIOD Those attending listened to live music enjoyed traditional food and beverages and joined in on games and activities at the Hauberg Estate mansion PERIOD

Originating from Munich Bavaria in Germany Oktoberfest is now celebrated by Americans each fall in honor of German American culture PERIOD And for the past three years the Quad Cities have not been excluded from the heritage or the festivities PERIOD

It is because of Oktoberfests German background that the event is so important to Claire Tobin assistant director at the German American Heritage Center PERIOD

The Quad Cities has a very very strong German history that a lot of people dont know about or maybe arent aware of Tobin said PERIOD Thousands of Germans settled here in the 1800s and 1900s and a lot of that German culture was suppressed and lost PERIOD Families didnt pass down traditions and languages they became very Americanized and wanted to assimilate into American culture. by hosting these annual Oktoberfest events Tobin hopes that people in the community might be able to celebrate and connect back to any lost culture PERIOD

For GAHC board member Todd Woeber Oktoberfest is more than just a tradition to celebrate German culture but a symbol of unity to immigrants of all identities who might be struggling to find acceptance in the United States PERIOD

You see a lot of immigrationrelated news nowadays and the story of the German immigration although it happened quite some time ago is somewhat related to what were seeing nowadays Woeber said PERIOD The organization can make a difference in showing other immigrants they can become part of the American society the American dream. this held true to Oktoberfest attendee Jern Elsesser who hoped to find a little bit of home in the Quad Cities by attending Oktoberfest festivities PERIOD

Im a German and I live here now as a permanent resident in Highland Park Illinois PERIOD I met my wife in Bavaria and she brought me here Elsaesser said PERIOD

The event served as a fundraiser for both the Hauberg Estate and GAHC with profits helping fund the operations behind both of the nonprofits PERIOD

The funding helps us with our programming and outreach Tobin said PERIOD Since we are a museum we rotate exhibitions and so it helps with bringing in new content and going into schools and doing outreach and educational things. executive Director of the Hauberg Estate Deb Kuntzi partnered with GAHC to support a fellow nonprofit and because of the Hauberg Estates own German heritage PERIOD

German American just seemed to be the perfect fit for us and for them because they dont have the space and we do Kuntzi said PERIOD And Hauberg was also German so it works out well for all of us. following Oktoberfest GAHC will be hosting their second annual German Fest with the Downtown Davenport Partnership PERIOD Those attending can expect to find live music familyfriendly games food and German beer PERIOD The event will take place in Kaiserslaurten Square in Davenport on Saturday Oct PERIOD  from  to  p.m. with free admission for the public PERIOD
