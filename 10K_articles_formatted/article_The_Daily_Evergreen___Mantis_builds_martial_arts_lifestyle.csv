Students learn mindfulness discipline selfdefense strategies in martial arts program

JOEL KEMEGUE Evergreen mint editor

February  

Down in the first floor of the Gladish Community Center Mantis Martial Arts teaches its students to defend themselves and live mindfully PERIOD

The place has been operating since  teaching Brazilian jiujitsu capoeira aikido and other martial arts forms PERIOD

Owner and jiujitsu instructor Shane McFarland has been practicing various forms of martial arts himself for  years PERIOD He began in college at Montana State University after he realized he was spending too much time with video games PERIOD

I got up Sunday morning started playing video games on my computer McFarland said PERIOD Next time I looked at the clock it was the exact same time I woke up. after that day McFarland said he gave away his video games and then needed something else to fill his free time with PERIOD After seeing an ad for a martial arts place McFarland was inspired to start PERIOD

McFarland said jiujitsu is a long slow road and that though you dont need to know much to protect yourself it can take  years to gain a black belt PERIOD Mastering jiujitsu takes technique proficiency and a character component PERIOD The International Brazilian JiuJitsu Federation does not want to give black belts to immoral people he said PERIOD

Samuel Bakken a student of Mantis Martial Arts said hes been with the place for as long as its been open PERIOD Bakken also serves as an assistant kids instructor for some of Mantis kids classes PERIOD

Mantis helps me develop grit Bakken said PERIOD It also helps me not allow my ego to get in the way of myself because youll see incremental improvements but youll also get smashed. paul Smith one of Mantis three aikido instructors said he was invited to train at Mantis two to three years ago PERIOD

Aikido Smith said is a martial arts form that stems from jiujitsu and sword practice and advocates for fending off attackers without hurting them whenever possible PERIOD

Its to see the conflict a long way off and soften the impact Smith said PERIOD One time I used it on the street PERIOD Two guys were going to mug me on an elevator they were on either side of me  so I waited until I saw movement and I just let my training take over  and I just wasnt where they thought Id be PERIOD They fell over each other and I just stepped away. besides the martial arts Mantis also provides Girls on Guard instruction a risk reduction program based on interviews and reports of sexual assault PERIOD The program is built to teach women natural body movements to protect themselves that are easy to remember under stress PERIOD

In other words youre not going to be able to think about protecting yourself so how can we teach people to protect themselves when you cant think McFarland said PERIOD Its an intelligently developed series of techniques that are easy to remember in times of stress. mcFarland said he tries to promote a jiujitsu lifestyle focused around being peaceful and putting in your all PERIOD

You carry yourself through life applying the discipline and the low ego mindset that you gain from the art into everything you do McFarland said PERIOD You start to eat a little bit better you start to hydrate you start to take time to clear your mind and be a little bit mindful. mcFarland is currently working on his doctoral degree in prevention science though he said he still plans to practice after hes gotten it PERIOD

Some people run some people lift weights PERIOD I do those things to supplement my jiujitsu. mcFarland said PERIOD Jiujitsu is what I do first  Im in this for the long term PERIOD I want to be doing jiujitsu when Im . joel Kemegue is the current editor of the Mint section and a sophomore creative writing major from Bellevue Washington PERIOD He enjoys reading writing and..
