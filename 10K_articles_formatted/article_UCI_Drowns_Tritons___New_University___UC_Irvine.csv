2640,2023-11-04,"the UCI Mens Water Polo team stretched its win streak to eight games on Friday with a tough victory against number  ranked UC San Diego PERIOD The Anteaters won  PERIOD The win brought UC Irvines record to  overall PERIOD

Sophomore Trent Baxter put in a goal off the top of the cross bar with  remaining in the fourth quarter to give UCI the push it needed to close the game PERIOD

The Anteaters got off to a slow start failing to put in a goal in the first quarter and scoring only once in the second PERIOD The Tritons on the other hand came out gunning going on a  run before Brandon Johnson scored in the second to put Irvine on the map PERIOD The Anteaters trailed  by the end of the first half PERIOD

The second half however was a different story as the Anteaters took a bite out of the UCSD lead with a fourgoal quarter PERIOD By the end of the third quarter the teams were tied at  PERIOD

We are starting to execute better PERIOD Our ability to score has improved quite a bit Head Coach Marc Hunt said PERIOD

In the fourth quarter both teams exchanged goals PERIOD UCSD enjoyed a lead after they scored off a power play early in the fourth quarter PERIOD However their lead was short lived after senior Tom Kruip tied the game at  and Baxter put in the winning goal late in the fourth quarter PERIOD

The team next took on fourth ranked UCLA in a conference match up PERIOD The Anteaters made a valiant effort late in the second to take the game into overtime however UCLA thwarted the Anteater offensive to win  PERIOD

Both teams came off the block slow with each only scoring one goal in the first period to finish tied at  PERIOD

The game plan in the first half was to take the air out of the ball and slow the pace down PERIOD We didnt want to let them dictate play PERIOD Unfortunately by doing so we become much more relaxed on offense PERIOD We were not aggressive enough Hunt said PERIOD

UCLA picked up on the lack of intensity in the second quarter and began to make a run quick with a goal early in the period PERIOD From then on the Bruins dictated play stretching that goal to a  run PERIOD At the end of the half Irvine was trailing  PERIOD

Things seemed as if it would only get worse in the second as UCLA continued to punish Irvine for its slowness PERIOD The Bruins eventually took a  lead with only a period and a half to go PERIOD

When UCLA was up I told the guys we had to take more risks PERIOD They had to play more aggressive PERIOD When they did it paid off Hunt said PERIOD

The Anteaters turned things around with more aggressive play and picked up momentum after Brandon Johnson put in a penalty goal in the middle of the third period PERIOD From that point on the Anteaters took control of the game PERIOD

It was the intensity we played at PERIOD In the first and second quarter we did not play with the energy we should have PERIOD In the third and fourth we came out with much more intensity senior wholeset Greg Enloe said PERIOD

The Anteaters scored once more during the third period continuing where they left off in the fourth PERIOD UCI turned the  run they had in the fourth quarter into five unanswered goals after junior Doug Lindsey put in a goal on a power play with a little more than two minutes left in regulation to tie the game at  PERIOD

However the Bruins finally were able to answer the Anteater run with a goal off a power play on the very next possession PERIOD

The Anteaters had one last chance to bring the game into overtime after they received a power play with less than  seconds on the clock but could not convert a goal PERIOD UCLA ran the clock out until the game ended to hold on to win PERIOD

We got the shot we wanted during the power play PERIOD We got it to the shooter we wanted to take the shot in the position where he shouldve been PERIOD The UCLA goalie just made a good save you have to credit him with that Hunt said PERIOD

The defeat was an improvement from the last time these two teams met however where the Bruins handily defeated the Anteaters  PERIOD

We have come a long way and worked hard and it is paying off PERIOD We may have lost but we have the confidence to be able to play against any of the top teams Hunt said PERIOD

Hunt later expressed that his goals on the season for UCI have not diminished even the slightest bit PERIOD

We are looking to win our conference nothing less PERIOD We can take out any big name out there Hunt said PERIOD

Next up the Anteaters take on Cal this Saturday the thirty-first at Berkeley PERIOD
