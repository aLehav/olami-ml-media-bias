8755,2016-05-10,"pizza Week has come and gone and for a brief moment the city of Portland was graced with a variety of innovative and unusual creations all roughly categorized as pizza PERIOD

The Portland Mercury hosted the citywide event PERIOD A total of  pizzerias contributed oneofakind entriespizzas with no history or prior records PERIOD

They have never been seen before and may never be seen again PERIOD It was a week that attempted to systematically deconstruct the very idea of pizza itself to challenge our assumptions of what pizza is and can be PERIOD Perhaps the most important thing about Pizza Week is what it can teach us about pizza as a concept pizza as a category of food PERIOD

We saw pizza infused with ginger ale Hot Lips Glazed and Infused pizza with beerinfused liquid cheese as a sauce Old Town Pizzerias The Balleluja pork nacho pizza Pizza Schmizzas Nacho Porko pizza using spicy brown mustard as a base Bella Faccia Pizzas She Bangs and so on PERIOD

Notably there was no reasonable way to sample all of them One had to prioritize PERIOD So in the interest of full disclosure I did not try all of the pizzas offeredor anywhere close to all of them PERIOD I tried precisely seven PERIOD But I maintain this was enough to gain some necessary perspective on what pizza has become in the twenty-first century PERIOD

Full disclosure part  I grew up in the Chicago area which means I have very strong opinions about pizza whether thick crust or thin PERIOD We take our cheeselaced carbs very seriously in the Midwest PERIOD It is how our people survive the winter PERIOD

We must begin with a necessary query What is pizza Think carefully PERIOD Most people say something like a flatbread topped with marinara cheese and toppings cooked in the oven at high temperatures PERIOD And yet it is exactly this sort of paradigm that Pizza Week seeks to deconstruct PERIOD

Bella Faccia Pizzas She Bangs used a spicy brown mustard as its base PERIOD No tomatobased sauce PERIOD Mississippi Pizza Pubs Buddha Pesto meanwhile was a vegan pizza that featured no cheese only roasted red peppers onions and artichoke hearts marinated in pesto and oil PERIOD

If this isnt complicated enough consider the following Some pizzas crossed over into other meals Hammys The Brekkie a breakfast pizza while others mixed cuisines from all over the world PERIOD We had French cuisine the beerinfused bechamel sauce of Old Town Pizzerias The Balleluja Mexican Pizza Schmizzas Nacho Porko Spanish Straight From New Yorks The Spanish Bomb Asian the toppings of Hot Lips Glazed and Infused and Southern barbecue Atlas Pizzas WhiskeySoaked Smoked Brisket Pizza PERIOD

We now live in a world where anything is considered pizza PERIOD Which is to say if everything is pizza then nothing is pizza PERIOD It has ceased to have a universally accepted definition PERIOD

Blame it perhaps on the lack of a West Coast pizza tradition as opposed to the fierce regional battles of Chicago vs PERIOD New York both clearly defined methodologies of pizza construction or on ambitious chefs and restaurateurs trying to outdo each other in the citywide culinary arms race a city home to a local brewery that features housemade Cheese Whiz on the menu for example PERIOD Im not making this up PERIOD

Perhaps no blame needs to be assigned at all PERIOD Perhaps we as a civilization have simply evolved beyond fixed categories of pizza PERIOD We may be ready to accept that pizza itself is just a construct something used by society to divide us as a people PERIOD Or the Universe may be in chaos and we can just do whatever PERIOD

Whatever position you decide to take on the issue you can likely find some pizzeria in the city willing to take you up on it PERIOD At this point you can probably just define it whatever way works best for you PERIOD I certainly wont try to stop you PERIOD
