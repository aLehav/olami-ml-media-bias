Northeastern administration recently unveiled a new system for class registration intended to streamline the process for students and facilitate simpler administrative maintenance for faculty PERIOD But some faculty and students said they were befuddled by their first experiences PERIOD

The system called Banner goes into effect for Fall  registration and is currently available for viewing on the myNEU portal PERIOD

Banner will allow students to search for classes in ways that were not possible using the old system instead of consulting an immediate list of available classes students search based on a series of criteria PERIOD

I really like the new system because you can search depending on whether a class is with your major or what department it is the times the days or what order you want your classes in said Student Government Association Vice President for Academic Affairs Michelle McNeilly who attended several meetings regarding the implementation of the program PERIOD

Students can also base their searches on professors and the type of classes they want to take PERIOD

Freshman chemistry Major Angelika Faron said she found the system confusing and harder to work with than the listings on the registrars website PERIOD

Maybe theyre trying to make it more user friendly but its not she said PERIOD

Senior Vice President for Enrollment and Student Life Philomena Mantella said the school had been shopping for vendors of a new system for a long time because a lot of components in Northeasterns infrastructure like the finance and student account systems were outdated PERIOD

This project is one thats been underway for a couple of years she said PERIOD Our current system is really of very old technology and very hard to make changes to PERIOD The Banner program is a subset of our larger replacement project. on Feb PERIOD  the school ran a mock registration that gave  students a chance to try the system for the first time PERIOD McNeilly said most of the students who have seen it so far have said they enjoyed it PERIOD

I got a lot of good feedback about it she said PERIOD People were very impressed with it but it is different PERIOD Once people get used to it its going to be a lot simpler. one of the major differences with the system is that students years and order of registration are determined by the number of credits they have accumulated rather than the time theyve been at the university PERIOD There are four levels to the credit system which eliminates the middler year from the calculation PERIOD Mantella said students shouldnt be worried about the change because it will have no bearing on their schedules or graduation dates PERIOD

When you count your terms at Northeastern if youre counting academic semesters its the equivalent of four years she said PERIOD I dont want people to try and focus on the fact that were changing something so middler year is going away. assistant journalism professor Dan Kennedy attended a faculty training session for the new system yesterday and said the general consensus of the approximately  trainees was that the process was vexatious PERIOD

What was a little bit frustrating about the training is that understandably they didnt want us experimenting on actual students so they set up kind of a fake site and it didnt seem to be working the way they had anticipated he said PERIOD

Mantella said the system was still in the process of being perfected but trial runs had been helping to work out issues and cater to some of the recommendations of those who had sampled it PERIOD

We still have things that will come up by virtue of more people getting on the system but I think they helped us improve language and identify things like firewall issues she said PERIOD We fulfilled what we were hoping to do. fall registration begins Tuesday March  PERIOD Students can check what time they are eligible to register in the myNEU portal PERIOD
