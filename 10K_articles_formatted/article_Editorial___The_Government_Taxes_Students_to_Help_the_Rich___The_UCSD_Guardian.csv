6225,2023-10-08,"in justifying trimming federal student loans by billions of dollars earlier this year Capitol Hill Republicans pointed to a ballooning national debt PERIOD However the deficit didnt appear to stop them last week when President George W PERIOD Bush approved the extension of lower taxes for capital gains and dividends essentially tax cuts for the wealthy PERIOD

The juxtaposition of the two issues is striking In general most agree that wider access to higher education and lower taxes contribute to economic growth PERIOD Indeed every argument used to justify extending the tax cuts applies equally well to financial aid and explains why it makes economic sense to keep interest on student loans low PERIOD

When the financial aid bill moved through Congress this board urged lawmakers to take a pragmatic stance PERIOD Though we knew that higher interest rates on loans would hurt students in the shortterm we also understood that the alternative was paying off a different debt down the line  one of the national variety PERIOD The same pragmatism however is absent in the governments current tax policy PERIOD

Despite the mathematical acrobatics used to show that tax cuts would not increase the nations deficit there is no doubt that the bill signed by Bush will widen the gap between the governments revenue and expenditures PERIOD Though low taxes may boost the economy now higher interest rates that accompany growing debt will hurt the economy for years to come PERIOD

For students who are now preparing for Julys big jump in loan interest rates this shortsighted sellout looks especially disgraceful PERIOD A nation that cannot afford financial aid certainly cannot afford more tax cuts PERIOD
