Taylor Swift is raging on the Grammy stage West is claiming  million dollars of debt and The Life of Pablo has been pirated over  times PERIOD Ye politics aside The Life of Pablo reminds us why this man is liked by so many and seen as an artistic inspiration to others PERIOD

The album brings in a number of outside artists old favorites like Kid Cudi and new artists Desiinger and fellow Chicago artist Chance the Rapper PERIOD West takes this album in a new direction PERIOD

It feels like a compendium of the lessons West has learned about music and life over his  year career PERIOD Instead of pushing the boundaries of what music and hiphop can do West takes popular styles like the Atlanta style of Pt PERIOD  and puts the Yeezy spin on it PERIOD

Though The Life of Pablo is not the best album produced by West it seems like the crowning jewel in his discography PERIOD The lessons learned from Yeezus can clearly be seen in the industrial beats that back up this album PERIOD We also glimpse the introspective West that was so prevalent in 808s  Heartbreaks in songs Real Friends and FML. the hardhitting honest and cocky West from Graduation comes through in songs Famous and I Love Kanye. the Life of Pablo examines the career West has had in a new way giving his audience the honest answers about the mistakes hes made the people hes trusted and the way fame has changed his life PERIOD Real Friends and Wolves are heartbreaking tracks that examine the dirty life of fame and the extortion it can bring PERIOD The biggest problem with the album is the emotional through line PERIOD

Unlike albums in the past Pablo does not contain an overt central line to guide the listener it is much more fragmented PERIOD

The Life of Pablo has a unique gospel aspect that sets it apart from other recent hiphopand West albums PERIOD The title draws allusions to both the apostle Paul and Pablo Picasso PERIOD The soulful vocals and religious imagery that litter the album bring in a new layer to many of the songs and Wests work PERIOD It brings an almost top down perspective to the album PERIOD The allknowing West of today looks back at the mistakes made and the path hes taken judging as God would judge him PERIOD

The honesty and form of The Life of Pablo will continue to intrigue and bring in listeners through its rolling release PERIOD

It is definitely a must listen for any hiphop heads PERIOD The Life of Pablo is currently only availableto stream on Tidal but a deluxe edition CD will be announced in the coming weeks PERIOD As with anything West related all of this could change in a second PERIOD For continued updates look to Wests Twitter feed kanyewest PERIOD
