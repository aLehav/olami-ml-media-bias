Xaviers Musketeer Madness took place last Saturday offering fans of both the mens and womens teams a chance to check out the rosters PERIOD As summer turns to fall and the first semester gets into full swing this weekends festivities officially make it basketball season on campus and around the city PERIOD

Similar to past years the night began with the introduction of the womens team followed by a threepoint shootout among junior Martha Thompson sophomore Kindall Fincher freshman Ashley Gomez and junior Anniina ijnen PERIOD Thompson eventually took the victory scoring  points to edge out her teammates PERIOD

The women then played a 10minute intersquad scrimmage with Thompson leading all scorers with four points PERIOD

After the men were introduced junior forwards Trevon Bluiett and JP Macura as well as senior transfer forward RaShid Gaston participated in the mens threepoint shootout PERIOD A backandforth contest eventually led to a tie between Bluiett and Macura with the former taking the victory after making more money ball shots PERIOD

The fans were then treated to an amazing dunk contest with freshmen Quentin Goodin and Tyrique Jones as well as sophomore Edmond Sumner taking part PERIOD Although eliminated first Goodin showed a great dunk to the fans using Bluiett to throw down off the side of the backboard PERIOD The biggest highlights of the contest however were definitely Jones leaping over his brother and mother and Sumner taking off from the free throw line PERIOD

The picturesque slam from Sumner eventually won him the contest PERIOD
