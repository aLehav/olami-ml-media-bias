One of Steve Sarkisians first actions as UW head football coach was to promise to put a fence around the state of Washington PERIOD

So far hes proven to be a man of his word PERIOD

Sarkisian has secured seven commitments in the past seven days most recently from highly touted running back Bishop Sankey of Spokane Wash PERIOD Sankey appears to be the final picket in the Huskies fence around the state as the speedster gives the UW commitments from what is widely regarded as Washingtons five top recruits PERIOD

The years prior to Sarkisians arrival were starkly different marred with the departure of many of the states top recruits to the darkest regions of the country PERIOD Jonathan Stewart the best running back the state has seen in a generation headed south to Oregon PERIOD Steve Schilling and David DeCastro perhaps the two best offensiveline recruits of the decade in Washington also both fled the Evergreen State to the University of Michigan and Stanford respectively PERIOD

Sure Keith Gilbertson and Tyrone Willinghams staffs were able to keep a few of the states gems at home  Jake Locker and Jermaine Kearse come to mind  but increasingly the most bountiful resources of the college football program were leaking away from Montlake PERIOD

To this juncture that has all changed with Sarkisian at the helm PERIOD

In  Willinghams last class only one of the states top10 prospects chose the UW PERIOD Last year the Huskies hauled in four of the states topsix recruits yet missed out on the big fish quarterback Jake Heaps who chose BYU PERIOD

Now the UW has emerged as the destination du jour for the states top prospects with Sarkisian and his staff having secured commitments down the Big Five wide receiver Kasen Williams tight end Austin SeferianJenkins and linemen Danny Shelton Tani Tupou and Sankey PERIOD

The key to Husky decadence in the Don James era unquestionably the most successful in the programs history was locking down the state of Washington and dipping into California and Hawaii for a few choice players PERIOD

So far Sarkisian has followed this blueprint to a tee PERIOD

Every current commitment to the UW in the class of  hails from one of these three states save safety Evan Zeger of Nevada who played his first three years of highschool ball as Williams and Heaps teammate at Skyline High School in Washington PERIOD

Of course the recruiting cycle never ends PERIOD Next year looks like a banner year for recruits in the state of Washington led by offensive lineman Zach Banner of Lakes High School whom recruiting pundit Tom Lemming already has ranked as the nations secondbest prospect PERIOD Banner lists the UW as one of his top choices  and the fact that his father Lincoln Kennedy was a national champion as a Husky probably doesnt hurt its chances PERIOD

The lifeblood of any sustained success in a college football program is great recruiting PERIOD Steve Sarkisian knows this and so far has done what he set out to do PERIOD Now he just has to keep working on that fence PERIOD
