Head coach Chris Tamas knows it wont be easy especially with the quick turnaround though Penn State also will be coming off a Friday night match as it will face Maryland at home on Friday night PERIOD

You dont have rest and recovery anymore Tamas said PERIOD Where before you could maybe take a couple days off maybe if you got some sore arms or sore legs you have a few days to rest those up PERIOD Now you dont have that rest anymore PERIOD You gotta go within  hours to play another big matchup. illinois will take on Rutgers on Friday night at  Central Standard Time before playing Penn State on Saturday afternoon at  p.m PERIOD
