An emotional Casey Anthony with her attorneys after being acquitted of murder charges at the Orange County Courthouse in Orlando Florida Tuesday July   PERIOD

ORLANDO Fla. the only thing everyone wanted was the truth What happened to Caylee Marie

Three years after the toddler who captivated the world was reported missing from her east Orange County Fla. home a jury decided prosecutors failed to prove that Caylees young single mother killed her PERIOD

Casey did not murder Caylee its just that simple lead defense attorney Jose Baez said outside the courtroom minutes after the verdict was read PERIOD While we are happy for Casey there are no winners in this case PERIOD

On Tuesday the 12member panel rendered verdicts that shocked and outraged many not guilty of firstdegree murder PERIOD Not guilty of aggravated child abuse PERIOD Not guilty of aggravated manslaughter of a child PERIOD

After deliberating for  hours over two days the jurors who heard from dozens of witnesses and saw hundreds of pieces of evidence throughout Anthonys 36day trial convicted her of four counts of lying to law enforcement which carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison per count PERIOD

Anthony who has been jailed since October  will be sentenced on those charges Thursday at  a.m PERIOD EDT PERIOD

She could walk out of the courthouse a free woman PERIOD

The relief that was evident in Casey Anthonys expression as the verdicts were read at  p.m PERIOD was a stark contrast to the tension that hung heavy in the silent courtroom in the moments leading up to the announcement PERIOD

Her parents George and Cindy Anthony sat silently in the back row where they have sat throughout the trial PERIOD Her brother Lee Anthony was not in the courtroom PERIOD

Inside the courtroom Casey Anthony and her attorneys held hands as each verdict came in PERIOD They remained composed until OrangeOsceola Chief Judge Belvin Perry thanked and dismissed the jury PERIOD

At that point Casey Anthony tightly hugged Baez and then the rest of her defense team huddled around her some of them crying their sobs resonating throughout the expansive courtroom PERIOD The team appeared giddy even Casey Anthony smiled as she was fingerprinted PERIOD

George and Cindy Anthony left the courtroom immediately after the verdicts PERIOD They didnt materialize until hours later when they pulled into their garage on Hopespring Drive in east Orange County around  p.m PERIOD A crowd of a few dozen onlookers snapped photos PERIOD

Through their attorney Mark Lippman George Cindy and Lee Anthony released a statement that read in part While the family may never know what has happened to Caylee Marie Anthony they now have closure for this chapter of their life PERIOD They will now begin the long process of rebuilding their lives PERIOD

The verdict is a stunning victory for Baez who was a relatively unknown lawyer from Kissimmee Fla. until Casey Anthony retained him PERIOD Outside the courtroom Baez spoke briefly and said now is the time for Anthony to grieve and grow and somehow get her life back together PERIOD

But before Baez took the microphone defense attorney Cheney Mason indignantly addressed the crowd of reporters in a packed room on the twenty-third floor of the Orange County Courthouse PERIOD

I hope that this is a lesson to those of you that have indulged in media assassination the last three years Mason said PERIOD Im disgusted by some of the lawyers .. PERIOD getting on television and talking about cases they dont know a damn thing about PERIOD .. PERIOD Now youve learned your lesson PERIOD

Soon after State Attorney Lawson Lamar held a news conference with Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings across the street from the courthouse surrounded by the investigative and trial teams PERIOD

Its always been about seeking justice for Caylee and speaking on her behalf Lamar said PERIOD

He praised Assistant State Attorneys Linda Drane Burdick Jeff Ashton and Frank George calling them worldclass prosecutors PERIOD Then he acknowledged the Sheriffs Office FBI and other lawenforcement agencies for their work on the case PERIOD

Still Orange Countys top prosecutor said his team felt disappointed with the verdict today and surprised because we know the facts PERIOD

Despite what your personal view as to guilt or innocence may be the criminal justice system has worked PERIOD We did our job PERIOD The jury did their job Lamar said PERIOD This is justice in America PERIOD

Outside the courthouse in the moments leading up to the verdict crowds swarmed the courthouse doors and sprawling courtyard PERIOD Dozens of people crowded into a cafe and overflowed out the doors at the adjacent public defenders office to watch the proceedings on television PERIOD

The cafe was silent as the verdict was read aloud by the court clerk PERIOD The crowd screamed and howled as the not guilty verdicts were announced PERIOD The shocked spectators grew louder with each not guilty PERIOD

I just dont feel justice is served said 44yearold Lynda Nickerson who drove from Apopka Fla. to be at the courthouse PERIOD The laws need to be changed if people can get away with murder PERIOD

The public may never know how the jury came to its conclusion PERIOD

The panel declined an offer to speak to the media after the verdict PERIOD Perry signed an order barring the release of their names even though in Florida juror identities are usually released at the conclusion of a trial PERIOD

One alternate who spoke to CNN said It was a horrific accident that Dad and Casey covered up and unfortunately it did snowball and got away from them PERIOD

Russell Huekler also known as juror No PERIOD  told CNN on Tuesday evening by phone that the prosecution did not prove its case PERIOD Because he was an alternate juror he was not in the deliberations room and was not privy to how the jurors reached their decision PERIOD

Huekler who was one of the final jurors picked in May is a dropoutprevention coordinator and U.S PERIOD government teacher who has been married three times and has a 23yearold son PERIOD He told lawyers he was neutral on the death penalty but probably would have voted against it PERIOD He was eager to serve on the jury PERIOD

The big question that was not answered was how did Caylee die Huekler said PERIOD

We may never know PERIOD
