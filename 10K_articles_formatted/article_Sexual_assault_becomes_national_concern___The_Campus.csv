8796,2023-11-04,"allegheny hires fulltime Title IX coordinator for first time

Christina Bryson News EditorNovember  

Last year  students were disciplined for sexual assault violations PERIOD Four students were expelled from the college and six students were suspended for a one to four semester period of time PERIOD

Sexual assault has become a national conversation across college campuses with Title IX at the forefront of the discussion PERIOD

Katie Pope was hired as Alleghenys first Title IX coordinator PERIOD This is the first time Allegheny has had the fulltime standalone position of Title IX coordinator PERIOD Pope began her position in September  PERIOD Before accepting her position at Allegheny Pope worked at Purdue University as the Title IX deputy coordinator and managing director of the Butler Center for Leadership Excellence PERIOD

Despite not having the fulltime position of Title IX coordinator prior to the  academic school year Pope explained similar positions have been in place at the college PERIOD

Theres been either a sexual harassment officer or an equal opportunity officer or a Title IX officer for a number of years said Pope PERIOD

Title IX of the United States Education Amendments of  guarantees equal opportunity in education PERIOD

No person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance reads the Title IX regulation PERIOD

Popes job as Title IX coordinator is to integrate Title IX regulations at the federal level with the colleges policies and procedures in addition to her other responsibilities like education outreach PERIOD

Im also responsible for making sure the faculty and staff get all the training theyre required to have Pope said PERIOD So far this fall weve trained something like almost  faculty and staff on Title IX just within the last month. sometimes I get from folks Well I told the student I wouldnt tell anybody. that option is not on the table PERIOD Its just not PERIOD

 Katie Pope

Pope also explained that her position is more individualistic than other positions on campus PERIOD

Its not like I have a big staff or anything like that but its in part that way because I need to work with a variety of different folks all across campus whether thats with the residence halls or thats with individual students or thats with student organizations or my colleagues in CIASS or my colleagues in the counseling center or whatever it is PERIOD Its just a pretty broad range Pope said PERIOD

Pope is in the process of training Title IX deputies and community support people who will be available to students as resources PERIOD Currently Jacquie Kondrot associate dean of students for wellness education and Mandy Prusia associate director of athletics for compliance  operations are serving as deputy Title IX coordinators PERIOD More faculty and staff are expected to be trained as deputies PERIOD

Pope alluded to miscommunication about what her position as Title IX coordinator entails PERIOD Being on campus just over a month Pope has already met with students concerned about the logistics of reporting a sexual assault in relation to Title IX responsibilities PERIOD

Heres what I need everybody on campus to understand said Pope PERIOD Lets say its a student reporting an assault PERIOD When a student goes to a faculty member staff member or me and says Ive been sexually assaulted all of those people are required by lawto report the assault to me as the Title IX coordinator PERIOD

So the first thing I want students to know is that while there are confidential resources available to students like the counseling center womens services those pieces if students go to somebody who doesnt have that role that capacity as a medical health provider in some way anyone else is required to bring that report forward PERIOD I say that because sometimes I get from folks Well I told the student I wouldnt tell anybody. that option is not on the table PERIOD Its just not PERIOD Thats part of the reason this national discussion is happening. when federallyfunded colleges have knowledge of a sexual assault the college is required by law to do respond PERIOD

Now I dont want that to deter students from reporting and thats why I stress that there are a number of confidential options available to them still because if somebody in the counseling center gets a report they dont have to come to me Pope said PERIOD They are contracted by their ethics clauses as counselors and they are not required to report PERIOD But if a student goes to their faculty adviser and reports that faculty adviser is required to bring that information to me. the only time a third party other than Pope will be notified of a sexual assault is if the student reports directly to Safety and Security PERIOD In this case security is required to contact the Meadville Police Department PERIOD However this does not mean a formal investigation will occur PERIOD The student always has the choice as to whether or not they want to file a formal complaint PERIOD

I dont want students to feel like if they report to somebody else that something big is going to happen Pope said PERIOD Thats not necessarily the case but the college needs to be aware so we can offer support services interim measures PERIOD Maybe a student needs new housing assignment or help getting some time out of a course because of the trauma of what has occurred PERIOD Its my job to make sure were helping that student to get whatever it is that they need PERIOD And then once the student would come in I would talk with them outline how our policies and procedures work talk with them about what a formal investigation a formal complaint means. whether students report a sexual assault to a confidential or a nonconfidential source students are not required to file a formal complaint PERIOD

When I say its nonconfidential its nonconfidential in so much as the report comes to me but it doesnt go any further than that Pope said PERIOD I work with the student to understand the policies and processes and let them determine what they need for supportive measures PERIOD In some cases it is possible I may determine it is essential for the safety of the college to pursue an investigation in which case I would pursue the investigation PERIOD If the student says they dont want to participate they would not be forced to participate but there could be situations where theres a potential safety issue of such concern that the college would need to continue with or without the initial student whos coming forward whether or not they would want to be a part of that. filing a formal complaint with the college does not turn the investigative process over to the authorities PERIOD Rather the college pursues an internal investigation with no connection to a criminal process PERIOD

They say probably only  percent of sexual violence cases are reported nationwide at colleges and universities PERIOD

 Jeffrey Schneider

Our investigative process is completely internal Pope said PERIOD It is entirely possible that a criminal process could be happening at the same time as our internal process PERIOD It really depends on how the incident is first reported and what the person reporting chooses to do. following a formal complaint an investigator is assigned to the case PERIOD The investigator collects evidence interviews the respondent and reviews the case against Title IX policies and college policies PERIOD The investigator then determines if it is more likely than not that a violation of the policy occurred PERIOD

And once the investigator has that determination theyll also recommend a sanction to go along with that determination and they will notify me of that I will review it and we will notify the parties Pope said PERIOD

If the respondent is determined guilty of a sexual assault by the investigator the sanctions that can be taken against the student includes warnings probation suspension or expulsion according to Joseph DiChristina dean of students PERIOD

In response to the The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs are required to keep and disclose information about crime on and near their respective campuses PERIOD Safety and Securitys annual security report which can be found online presents crime data from  as calendar years PERIOD The security report includes anonymous reports in addition to formal reports PERIOD

Two cases of nonforcible sex offenses were filed in  PERIOD Nonforcible sex offenses can include incest and statutory rape PERIOD No domestic violence or stalking cases were reported between  PERIOD

Jeffrey Schneider director of Safety and Security explained that the  report is the first report to include dating violence domestic violence and stalking as separate categories PERIOD This means that no data would have been included in these categories for previous years PERIOD But this does not mean reports categorized under dating violence domestic violence and stalking for  and  are unreported rather if reported they are included in other categories PERIOD

Under the category of forcible sex offenses in  one report was filed five reports were filed in  and  reports in  PERIOD Forcible sex offenses according to the security report include forcible rape forcible sodomy sexual assault with an object forcible fondling indecent assault and sexual assault nonforcible intercourse occurring without consent PERIOD

From  reports of forcible sex offenses have increased PERIOD Pope suggests that the increase in accounts is more so an increase in reporting assaults than an increase of assaults per year PERIOD

Schneider agrees PERIOD

We can only speculate Schneider said PERIOD One reason is we think were doing a better job with education PERIOD Sexual assaults nationwide are the most underreported crime PERIOD They say probably only  percent of sexual violence cases are reported nationwide at colleges and universities PERIOD So that means  percent are not for whatever reason. education efforts through the college hope to teach students how to effectively respond to sexual violence PERIOD DiChristina noted an increase in bystander training attendance in the  academic year PERIOD

Its starting to become part of the culture now students being attentive to and caring for others said DiChristina PERIOD
